You\u2019re well within your rights to not let your daughter\u2019s or fianc\u00e9\u2019s daughter\u2019s boyfriend move in with you. It\u2019s your house. That being said I\u2019d like to propose a potential compromise (which you\u2019re still within you\u2019re rights to not want to do, you know the situation better than I do). \n\nBefore anything else, daughter needs to apologize to her mom (and you) for the things she said when she moved out. You and her mom warned her about this and now that she\u2019s proved you both right, she wants you to come in and fix things for her. \n\nI\u2019m a big softie, so I\u2019d probably let them move in, but I\u2019d give them some very strict rules and even make them sign a contract. And leave it in no uncertain terms what will happen if these rules are broken. Stuff like no drugs/alcohol in the house. Set a curfew for whatever time you don\u2019t want people coming in and out of your house. Absolutely zero guests without prior permission from you personally (not just fianc\u00e9). Make the boyfriend pay rent, at least enough to cover the added utilities and groceries that I\u2019m sure they will use/consume (fianc\u00e9 can\u2019t pay this for them either). And any other rules you think may be relevant. I get the impression that you\u2019re set up well enough financially that it won\u2019t be a massive burden for you to have them move in, but this helps better prepare them for what being an adult is like and get them back on their feet as you said. \n\nUltimately, it sounds like you just generally don\u2019t approve of boyfriend (probably understandable, 18yr girls with a challenging upbringing often tend to not make the best choice in boyfriends) and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable at all to not want him to stay with you. But if fianc\u00e9\u2019s daughter has made it clear that he\u2019s going to be a part of her life, I think it may go a long way to show some extra compassion. This isn\u2019t supporting her decision, but supporting her as a person which can go a long way. It\u2019ll be easier for daughter to eventually break up with him if she feels like she has a loving place to come home to, and she probably feels like you\u2019re not supporting her decision to date this person by not allowing him to live with you. Which may cause her to want to stay with him longer than she should. \n\nEither way, make sure fianc\u00e9 is on the same page with you about things like this. You\u2019re marrying this person and their daughter comes with the package. While daughter may be 18, parenting doesn\u2019t stop just because the child is a legal adult.

Your fiance works, but  her money only goes to her needs yet wants to regulate who lives  in a house doesn't own or financially contribute to? You said no once...end of discussion.  I would've kicked her out when she brought", "Info\n\nEverything you tell us-without-telling-us about your fiance and her daughter describe unstable people with ruptured, unstable relationships. You are the only one providing any stability.\n\nYears ago, weren\u2019t you concerned that this woman you were dating didn\u2019t have her shit together enough to have custody of her child? \n\nThat it took 8 years to finally be allowed to have her daughter in her home\u2014 only as the child was a legal adult? Does your fiance even have her shit together now?", "It\u2019s going to be much easier for you if you stand your ground. The fianc\u00e9 will be sat down and told that you understand that this is a deal breaker and although you\u2019d like to continue with her you will be ok with her moving out and making a home for her daughter and the BF. Tell your fianc\u00e9 that if she does want to continue in your relationship that you will allow her daughter to move back in with rules and boundaries governing that. The boyfriend should not move in but should find his own way. They can date but he can only be there when you are. \nWhat will happen if you are firm? The daughter will likely move back in. The fianc\u00e9 will be able to try and restart her relationship with her kid and you get to breath a sigh of relief each day that that boyfriend is not in your home. Hopefully that will be enough. Sounds like both the fianc\u00e9 and the daughter need therapy to become more mature interpersonally.", "But there is no actual \u201cwe\u201d it is you who is giving all of the support. Get out while you can. Sounds like they are all users", "If your fianc\u00e9 wants to use her income to house them, sure, whatever. BUT You don't owe the bf ANYTHING! That is a 20 yo grown man who should be responsible for figuring out his own shit. NTA", "Please don\u2019t get married yet! Once you are, it will be her house too and they will move right in. You will never get rid of them.", "NTA. Not by a long shot. Don\u2019t give in. Your house, your rules. End of story.", "NTA here, you need to rehome both your fianc\u00e9 and her daughter/bf combo.", "Just say no- maybe to daughter also- I would not be able to tolerate the dysfunction and constant irritating behaviors. Also do they have jobs and goals. Need to learn to manage their finances and start paying for living expenses. If not you are helping them to stay dependent. Mom needs to grow a spine also. Encouraging bad behaviors in her daughter. She might not be worth the trouble either.", "If you let them in your home, you will swiftly regret that decision. Hold your ground. You should really consider letting the fiance go as well. Her past problems are started to make themselves known and will be part of your life if you stay with her. End this relationship ASAP", "Ops gf can move out, get her own apartment, and THEN have her daughter and her daughter's bf move in. He needs to stand firm. That daughter and her bf could be there forever", "You're making the right decision, daughter needs to focus on finishing hs, not a boyfriend. They can take", " NTA. Hell to the no. Girl needs to grow up. You let him move in you will be raising their baby in a year. Bet.", "NTA. Once you let them in, it will be really hard to get them out. I think your stand of daughter yes, boyfriend no is completely reasonable. This isn't her husband or life partner, it's her recent high school boyfriend!", "NTA and please don\u2019t enable these bad decisions", "NTA.  I get that your wife is desperate,  but this is unhealthy,  AND this is a terrible precedent for setting boundaries. \nWeirdly entitled attitude from a kid.   Yes,  she's technically an adult,  but this is childish behavior and childish history of choices.", "It\u2019s your house your rules NTA \n\nI think if anything were to happen especially with daughter since she\u2019s \u201c18 and an adult\u201d first of all I CLEARLY see the difference between the 20 year old and an 18 year old!? Yeah where did they meet? How did they meet? What the heck is happening!?  But it\u2019s your house and I would put a rental agreement with daughter. She wants to act like an adult. Ok she can be one by paying rent on time doing her own chores and cleaning after herself. And if she really does want her boyfriend there (which probably won\u2019t end in anyway good) make sure there\u2019s an AGREEMENT that says everything you want them to know and a LIST of things you want from them in return. Like the daughter said if she wants to be an adult then she can act like one by paying rent, cleaning their half of the house, etc. make sure there\u2019s signed papers from you, fianc\u00e9, and daughter and her boyfriend. At least do that ok?", "the fiance is the reason the daughter is like that!", "Except Fiance is not covering her own expenses, OP is. He said he basically covers most if not all of the bills. She's a free loader, already has taken the inch and now is trying for the mile.", "NTA and you will absolutely regret it if you let them move in and also absolutely regret it if you marry someone who says you're an AH for not letting her daughter's bf move in with you.  That is 100% meal ticket status, you don't want to think so for obvious reasons but any third party observer can see you are heading for disaster and need to end this now before it becomes sooooo much worse.", "Your girlfriend is separate from her daughter. Her daughter has shown questionable decision making. Don't let her get a foothold into the house.\n\nGet a ring or some cameras to keep a track of who comes and goes. Don't let them stop by and end up staying. \n\nYou will find out that people who feel like you should be doing more for them, seem to find ways to \"take\" things from your home because you were being \"unfair\" to them. Make sure you let your girlfriend know that they are trying to manipulate her and that her daughter has made the decision to be with someone who is not stable. That is her decision and does not have any bearing on her. Be kind and let them understand that no means no. good luck.", "How is she freeloading? She has a job.", "I think I\u2019m just cautiously optimistic that this is more of a na\u00efvet\u00e9/desperation thing from fianc\u00e9 than a malicious one. I guarantee the daughter truly thinks all she needs is a few months of lower expenses to get her life on track and that her fianc\u00e9 wants to believe that so hard that she can\u2019t say no. Obviously the daughter is going to get pregnant or somehow not be able to move back out on her own within a reasonable time frame but that might not be so obvious to a mom who desperately wants to have a relationship with her daughter she lost custody of for most of her life.", "While I agree that OP is NTA, and frankly I wouldn't let my daughter's BF live with us, these situations don't always turn out poorly. \n\nMy partner and I had to move in with their parents early on in our relationship. At the time everyone thought we wouldn't last because it was a young whirlwind romance but here we are over 20 years later with a VERY strong marriage, financially secure enough for my partner to stay home with the kids, and living 1000 miles away from all our family on our own. \n\nHaving that early support certainly helped and we're a statistical anomaly, but we're not special. Anyone could have what we have if they are committed to the success of their relationship and open to honest and mature communication.", "FR like with all the money he is spending he better get a crack at the daughter too", "He pays all the house, all the bills, all the groceries, and gives her extra money.", "I see I wasn't the only thinking that at the back of my mind", "Yeah right? \nI moved in with my fianc\u00e9 and she saw how depressed I was at my job and offered to \u201ckeep the lights on\u201d if I wanted to quit. So I quit. You fucking bet the house was clean and the meals were cooked. \nI had savings and found employment a month later so she wasn\u2019t out of pocket at all. But fuck. No way I would have asked to move my friends in. Later that year my work dried up so she was paying for everything for an extended stretch. Even took on an extra day work even tho she\u2019s studying. \nAgain. House clean. Lunches packed. Dinners cooked.", "With how he described the daughter; that\u2019s why it\u2019s going to turn out bad. \n\nI agree, not all situations are bad.", ">OP is whipped\n\nIt doesn't even have to be this. A LOT of men specifically feel an internal need to rescue or save the damsels in distress. This \"white knight\" behaviour can manifest in a lot of ways, not the least of which is financial support.", "That's not freeloading, they're married lol. Are you suggesting she gets her own place or something?", "THIS!!! \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "I had to make my son live on the streets because of his addictions.  It wasn't until he turned 40 before he figured life out.  He is now living in a drug free house, and doing well.  I couldn't accept him into my house to mistreat his younger siblings.  I SO understand where you are.", "Plus the partner is 20 years old... Let him get a place of his own", "They aren't married. Yes, I'm suggesting he rethink the relationship.", "Depends on how cushy the free place to stay is. He's more likely to do the flit back and forth whenever he wants needs a bed to sleep in or a hole to poke", "I\u2019d be so confident of that I\u2019d be saying it. \u2018No chance you guys are moving in here, but I will spring for birth control.\u2019", "Lmao!", "This is a better solution than moving the deadbeat boyfriend in an having your valuables start going MIA, only to turn up at the neighborhood pawn shop.", "> They aren't married.\n\n\nThem being married or engaged isn't relevant to the point you're making. \n\n\n\n>  Yes, I'm suggesting he rethink the relationship.\n\n\nWhy exactly?", ">socialism is pretty ok in my eyes.\n\nEnjoy other people telling you what job you can work, where you can live, how you can spend your money, and what property you can own do you?"]}
