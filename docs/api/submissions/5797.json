Maybe you should have given your son a heads up, since he had a sentimental attachment to it, but you're not an AH for removing it.", "NTA.  He's going to be upset, because it means a lot to him, but hopefully he'll understand.\n\nGrowing up, our next door neighbor was an older lady who had her son and his children move in shortly before we moved into our own home.  Her son built a treehouse for his son,  but his son wouldn't use it.  He'd rather be inside playing video games or watching TV.  His daughter, who is a year older than I am, and I became friends and we kind of took it over since it wasn't being used.\n\nWhen the dad made it, he had cut out the door hole and had two windows, one on hinges and one that broke.  We talked him into repairing the broken window and found wood to replace the door.  We decorated it, kept blankets and snacks and stuff inside, kept it clean and used a broken broom to sweep it, even rigged a rope and bucket from one window so we wouldn't have to struggle to carry things in.  That was our hang out spot.\n\nCome high school, we stopped using it as much.  She'd sneak up there to smoke or we'd go up there for a bit of nostalgia, but once we found a snake in there, it was all over.\n\nSeveral years later, the older lady had passed away and her sons had inherited the house.  While cleaning it up, her dad tore down the treehouse.  My dad called my mom, who sat me down and told me that the treehouse was going down.\n\nIt sounds a little silly, but I was sad.  That was a safe place.  That was our hang out place.  We spent so much time there.  We put so much into it.  Your son is sad, he's going to be upset, and that's OK.  He'll come around, but right now he's got to grieve for a big part of his childhood.", "NTA\nI think you had a valid reason.\n\nI would say the only thing you could have done differently was make it known to your son that you were going to take it down.", "NTA. The son isn't going to pay for cameras now is he lol also teens sneaking into your tree house aren't going to give a damn about a no trespassing sign. Taking it down was the clear and obvious answer. \n\nHonestly not even sure why he would care so much. He still hast he memories and thats whats important. The physical unused object doesnt' matter.", "NTA - as if a no trespass sign would stop them, and cameras won\u2019t do much either\n\nSure you should have called him and given him a heads up before hand\n\nBut you have strange teens sneaking into your yard,begat if they get drunk? Or so drugs?\n\nWhat if they start egging each other in to do stuff to your house, as teenagers are won\u2019t to do \n\n\nNo, it had to go", "NAH. Taking the treehouse down was the right thing to do, but your son isn\u2019t wrong for being hurt. You could have called him, and probably should have, but I\u2019m not calling you an ah for that. You should probably hug your son and apologize, though.", "NTA- Something bad is going to happen either way if you left it up. Someone is going to have an accident and you're going to get sued or someone worse than drunk teens are going to start using it and who knows where that could end up. It's understandable he is upset but he was going to have to get over it's lose at some point and now it's proving dangerous he needs to get on and learn to live without it.", "NTA - someone could get hurt and you could be liable. No trespassing signs aren\u2019t going to stop teenagers. It would\u2019ve been nice to give your son a heads up before you did it, but there wasn\u2019t really another solution that would\u2019ve been effective.", "Oh no!  What about the poor neighborhood teens?  Where are they supposed to go now?  \n\nNAH.", "NTA, though I do think you could've given your son a heads up it was being taken down so he had a chance to have whatever last moment with it since it's clearly important to him, and I can understand why he's upset.\n\nNot saying you were wrong to take it down or should've waited longer, just a \"hey, I'm taking down the tree house on X date, just a heads up\" would've been better.", "NTA. He is 23 not 13.", "NTA, you\u2019re the one who built it and if random teenagers are hanging out in there you have the right to take it down. However, I completely understand your son being sad and distressed because something that holds so many good memories has been destroyed. I think you probably should have given him a heads up so that he could maybe spend a last moment with it or something. Either way, the fact that he\u2019s so sentimental about the treehouse shows that you gave him a happy childhood and if you apologize and talk to him I think he\u2019ll understand.", "Gently, YTA. You should have at least have given your son the courtesy of a phone call before you took the treehouse down. He deserved at least the chance to go up one more time or to help you take it down.", "Your decision, your property, your liability & not your son's. But DAMN I can see why he's upset. \n\nNTA", "NTA - Your son is an adult and not longer lives there, so his opinion is invalid. Taking that safety hazard down was the right call. otherwise, what? Spend hundreds of dollars rehabbing it just for it not to get used, or worse used by hooligans'? No, you did the right thing.", "NTA. You don't have to consult your son about decisions regarding your property.", "NTA", "Nta....kids ignore signs no matter what....cameras ok but do you really want to have to monitor a huge plant and some boards?\n\nNot to mention you'd be responsible for trespassing teens who would decide to do other stuff besides smoking cigs...and be glad it was water and nothing else.", "yta for not telling him first about it. Even tho it sounds like it was a safety hazzard and the last thing you need is a drunk teen falling and hurting themselves. \n  \nMaybe - if you still have any scraps left - you can give your son a small piece of the treehouse for him to keep as a memory and small tangible item to say hey, sorry i made a major decision on your childhood fort without asking for your input", "YTA. That treehouse meant something to your son, you knew that, went into detail about it, then just threw it away without so much as a comment. At the very least he should have been informed ahead of time and not let to discover it on his own.", "NTA", "YTA. for not realizing your adult son would be sad and possibly being defensive about your choice of nuclear to solve the security issue.  \n\nGo say sorry for being an ah. And promise to build your son a new one at his house if or when he had a child.  \n\nPs I like your wife she sounds like the calm voice of reason.", "nta, I think you son needs therapy if this is his reaction to something he has not used in years, that you built, on your property. Why should he get a say.", "NTA.\n\nhe is \\*twenty three\\*  \nOur memories aren't tied to physical things, but for some reason, people have this incredibly strong attachment.

This is a great post and a sad post all rolled into one.  \n\nIt's great because a father and a 9-year-old boy built a treehouse together, and then used it to create memories in it that were so special the treehouse was still cherished by a 23-year-old man.  That is just amazing!  How many children do something with their dad that has this kind of impact?  Unfortunately, way too few!  \n\nIt's a sad post because, even though OP probably made the responsible choice, the son needed time to process the loss of that treehouse.  Here is what I would do.  Find a picture of your son in the treehouse - one where you see the whole tree house.  Take it to an artist that specializes in drawings from pictures and commission a piece for your son.  My hairstylist wife does these, and they are amazing.  It is something he can have for the rest of his life and might help heal the ache from the loss.  NAH", "NTA.", "NTA It's a liability and nobody was using it like you said.", "NAH- you did the right thing but I understand why he is upset", "NTA. Sounds like it was a safety concern and frankly, you had caught a handful of teens in there and they would return. Better to tear down a treehouse than have someone\u2019s kid get injured on your property", "As someone who works handling insurance claims, your concerns are 1000% valid. Taking it down was absolutely the right thing to do once you saw what was happening. Despite it being trespassing, it would be consider \u201can attractive Nuisance\u201d and could expose you and your home owners insurance to a claim. I see why he\u2019s upset but protecting yourself is a must. NTA", "YTA.\n\nYour son loved that treehouse and you didn't even tell him it was coming down.\n\nThat's like cleaning out his room while he's away, and not telling him. Or like putting down the family pet, and not telling him.\n\nYou should have told him before you did it, so he could tell you not to.", "NTA. It was a matter of safety and liability. It's a shame that your son didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to the treehouse, but it's not something you leave up after finding out it's a problem.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your property, your son is an adult and just have to deal. Do you guys kept a shrine\u2026I mean his bedroom as it was when he lived at your house ?", "Yeah, I should have told him. I definitely didn't want to wait until winter to take it down though, and I don't think he would have been able to make an extra trip just for that. But yeah, I could have told him what I was doing so he had time to adjust.", "Yeah, I'm no lawyer, but I think a litigiously inclined person could definitely sue me if their kid falls out of my tree, right? That's not paranoid, is it?", "Maybe if there\u2019s wood left from it, you can gift it to him in someway. Like use it to make a bookshelf,  table, or a miniature treehouse.", "Thank you for sharing this story with me. This is a good perspective into my son's thought process.", "Hahaha. Good one.", "But, who knows when an accident might have occurred.", "Oh, for pity's sake. NTA. The son is an adult, and that tree house was a litigation in waiting. He was aware kids were using it for drinking and smoking, and it was dangerous all around to keep it up. There could be serious consequences if those kids had an accident. He really had no choice but to take it down, and the son should be mature enough to understand that.", "That seems a little extreme. It's not that weird for a young adult to have a sentimental attachment to something from his childhood.", "If you have some of the wood left see if it can turned into a keepsake. A picture frame maybe? Frame a picture of him in the tree house.", "Sultan is right.  Further, you are now on 'notice' of trespassers, so you couldn't claim ignorance of the risk.  You were smart to remove it.", "I don't think this wood is in good enough condition to be made into anything that needs to support weight, but maybe a little carving, yeah.", "That's a really lovely idea. Especially a miniature treehouse! You could even decorate it to match the original. \nAlternatively, since those are a lot more work, especially if you are not already a woodworker, what about finding some photos of the treehouse and printing and framing them? Try and get one of the two of you and make it a really nice present. \n\nBasically, do something to show you understand the loss your son feels about getting rid of a significant part of his childhood. Because that is quite likely how he feels. That a place that represented his youth was just destroyed. Write a card to go with it acknowledging this.\n\nedit: For bonus points, if you are able to either make something from the wood or pay someone to do it, make the frame for the photo from the treehouse.", "No problem.", "A five minute phone call would have prevented this post from ever having been written. He couldn\u2019t be bothered and that\u2019s wrong.", "Agreed. Seems a bit harsh. Your son certainly gets a say, but he isn\u2019t the final decision maker. Ultimately NTA, heck treehouses aren\u2019t supposed to last that long anyway, bad for the tree (unless it\u2019s dead in which case better to take it down also before it rots) they don\u2019t last forever", "This was going to be my suggestion too.  Or, if he has enough wood, maybe build a mini treehouse for him.", "Bird house?", "I like it.", "Even better if it\u2019s a birdhouse ornament imo if he celebrates Christmas. Then it will be preserved for many years and can be a reminder of his awesome treehouse each holiday season.", "Esp if you can kind of make it look like the og tree house.  If the wood isn\u2019t good enough maybe from scratch make a replica birdhouse or mailbox, maybe even tissue box holder and a splinter from the wood could serve as a sign for the new miniature house.", "happy ending!!!", "Maybe a picture frame with the two of you in it", "Ok. YTA but not in a way you think. The fact is that he HELPED build the tree house adds context here. He BUILT that with you. So, he is as involved with the decision of keeping it as you are. What if your wife decides she no longer liked.the house and decided to sell it without your input. You would be mad because she is making decisions when you are a vested party. Same deal here. He had stakes in that tree house so he did have a say in it. You should have said something before even touching it. You basically undid the work he put in and wouldn't let him have a last moment or come to terms with it", "YTA", "NAH but I would offer something a bit odd. Tell him that you are taking down the tree house for security and safety reasons but you'll store the (salvageable) components until he buys a house. When he buys a house, you'll help him reassemble the structure in a tree or as a ground level playhouse.", "NTA.  However, I bet you have a lot of pictures of your son in that treehouse\u2026 perhaps you could make a nice album or one of those collage frames with the pictures in it and give it to him as a peace offering.  Proof that you know how important this treehouse was to him, and that it had a special place in your heart as well.", "NTA.\n\nTeens trespassing is already distressing. What if it were some degenerate using it to peep? Or someone trying to live in there with your your knowledge?

Worrying about this childhood treehouse should not even cross his mind, nostalgia or otherwise.", "NTA, maybe you should have called him, but yes you would be held liable if any accident happened on your property even if you didn't let the kids up there.", "NTA.  Safety issues and liability issues.  \n\nGood memories are a good thing, but holding on to the stuff that helped make them can be a burden.  This thing needs to go, to protect your home from trespassers.", "NTA but you could tell him you\u2019re all in for helping him build another one when he has a tree of his own.", "Telling him would have been the right thing to do, but cameras and a no trespassing sign?", "I guess technically you should've asked him or informed him so he could've saved it. But, on the other hand you didn't know he was sentimental about it. A good way to go forward would be to rebuild it with him, if he wants kids you can wait till his kids are old enough to help. Honestly that's a better solution than using an old tree house anyways. I don't think you are malicious in anyway, just a mistake.", "NTA. When your son gets his own home. Help him build a tree house.  Right now yours turned into liability", "NTA your \u2018kid\u2019 is a grown adult acting like a child being mad about this.", "I\u2019m sorry but selling a house and tearing down a tree house are not the same thing. I agree that OP was a little bit TA for not talking to his son and letting him know the plan but there is a difference between his wife selling THEIR HOUSE and him tearing down a treehouse that wasn\u2019t structurally sound and was being used by random teenagers on OP\u2019s property without OP\u2019s knowledge. And to touch on the \u201cwhy not get a sign or cameras?\u201d That\u2019s really expensive for a dilapidated treehouse that no one in the family used anymore.", "Man attractive nuisance is fucking wild. Someone can illegaly enter your property and sue you?\n\n*bro its your own fault, you should have known people would want to tresspass.*", "That's an interesting point. But say some kids climb on my roof which is a complete normal roof for a house, in a normal neighbourhood of other similar houses with similar security, and they fall off and break some bones. Surely I'm not liable? And so where is the line? What if I don't have a treehouse but some kids climb my tree and fall out of that?", "If they fell out due to your failure to maintain (or even because they were just drunk) they'd very likely have won the lawsuit."]}
