He's going to be upset, because it means a lot to him, but hopefully he'll understand.\n\nGrowing up, our next door neighbor was an older lady who had her son and his children move in shortly before we moved into our own home.  Her son built a treehouse for his son,  but his son wouldn't use it.  He'd rather be inside playing video games or watching TV.  His daughter, who is a year older than I am, and I became friends and we kind of took it over since it wasn't being used.\n\nWhen the dad made it, he had cut out the door hole and had two windows, one on hinges and one that broke.  We talked him into repairing the broken window and found wood to replace the door.  We decorated it, kept blankets and snacks and stuff inside, kept it clean and used a broken broom to sweep it, even rigged a rope and bucket from one window so we wouldn't have to struggle to carry things in.  That was our hang out spot.\n\nCome high school, we stopped using it as much.  She'd sneak up there to smoke or we'd go up there for a bit of nostalgia, but once we found a snake in there, it was all over.\n\nSeveral years later, the older lady had passed away and her sons had inherited the house.  While cleaning it up, her dad tore down the treehouse.  My dad called my mom, who sat me down and told me that the treehouse was going down.\n\nIt sounds a little silly, but I was sad.  That was a safe place.  That was our hang out place.  We spent so much time there.  We put so much into it.  Your son is sad, he's going to be upset, and that's OK.  He'll come around, but right now he's got to grieve for a big part of his childhood.", "NTA\nI think you had a valid reason.\n\nI would say the only thing you could have done differently was make it known to your son that you were going to take it down.", "NTA.

This is a great post and a sad post all rolled into one.  \n\nIt's great because a father and a 9-year-old boy built a treehouse together, and then used it to create memories in it that were so special the treehouse was still cherished by a 23-year-old man.  That is just amazing!  How many children do something with their dad that has this kind of impact?  Unfortunately, way too few!  \n\nIt's a sad post because, even though OP probably made the responsible choice, the son needed time to process the loss of that treehouse.  Here is what I would do.  Find a picture of your son in the treehouse - one where you see the whole tree house.  Take it to an artist that specializes in drawings from pictures and commission a piece for your son.  My hairstylist wife does these, and they are amazing.  It is something he can have for the rest of his life and might help heal the ache from the loss.

Try and get one of the two of you and make it a really nice present. \n\nBasically, do something to show you understand the loss your son feels about getting rid of a significant part of his childhood.

We all know a \"no trespassing\" sign wouldn't stop most teenagers.", "NAH you made the best decision to protect yourself and your son is discovering he\u2019s an adult now and desperately clinging to the joys of childhood.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t think anyone is in this situation Hopefully the son will understand in time.", "Let me answer your question with a question. Was i the asshole for tearing down a shoddily constructed treehouse that the neighbors children built on my property? No you say?  I thought the same thing you did someone could get hurt and i would be on the hook for it.", "NTA. Those teens would have definitely returned.", "I think YTA for not telling him. That place was probably his haven and held a lot of memories that you didn\u2019t let him relive or say goodbye to. Soft YTA.", "NTA. Your son needs to grow up. Oh wait, he is a grown man. If he can't understand the potential liability involved, he hasn't grown up enough. I understand that the tree house holds great memories, but it's time is over. It serves no purpose now. He needs to understand the impermanence of things.", "NTA. bruh if someone broke into my treehouse i am immediately taking it down !!!!", "NTA. It was definitely a mistake to do it without letting him know, but what kind of grown man throws a fit at his father for dealing with what has now become a safety hazard?", "NTA. As a previous teen, no trespassing signs didn\u2019t work.", "NAH\n\nYou would feel worse if some kid fell out of your tree.", "NTA But your son\u2019s reaction at 23 is an issue.  Tell him he can rebuild it and stay in it an protect it.  Are there other issues with this young man?", "NTA but letting him know would of been nice\u2026but definitely NTA.\n\n\nHow could you be one when you actually built him a treehouse?!?! My goodness I\u2019m so jealous your son grew up with a tree house. I begged my dad for one, but it wasn\u2019t taken seriously bc I\u2019m a girl (oh the 80\u2019s!). Lol I would climb this massive tree we had that would have been perfect for one\u2026fell out of the tree all the time somehow never broke anything!", "NAH I understand why he\u2019s upset but I also understand why this is something you have to do. Do you have any photos of it when it was up? Maybe you could have an artist (look on Etsy, I\u2019m sure you can find someone) do a drawing of it to gift him as a keepsake? I saw other people with the idea of a miniature too or a piece of the wood.", "I wonder if you could use a picture to get a 3D model printed for him, to remember it by.", "NTA\n\nBUT you should've told him you were tearing it down so he could come out and see it one last time. But hindsight is 20/20, as they say.", "NAH: I get what you're saying about the liability concern but you should've told him. It could have given him the opportunity for closure.", "Reading the comments i have the faint idea that a criminal can actually get the law to punish the victims in the USA... Wow", "Yeah, OP\u2019s son can\u2019t expect OP to preserve the treehouse as a shrine to his childhood (all the concerns were very valid), but a heads up would have been good.", ">  and I don't think he would have been able to make an extra trip just for that.\n\nnostalgia will make people do things.", "Does he know you'd be legally responsible if anyone got hurt being in, or coming down from, the treehouse?  That's no joke.\n\nCaviat, this is the case in California.  If kids get into anything on your property and get hurt, you are liable.  You can put a fence up ($$$), but they still try to get around it and sue.  Maybe it's not so bad in other states.", "Plot twist; what was in those bottles wasn't water. Gin, vodka, other fun clear substances.\n\nYou were right to take it down, and I like the mini replica option. Your son will grow to understand your POV, but right now, he's sad and that's okay.", "Right, I'm not suggesting that OP wait longer before taking it down, just tell the son it was happening. I imagine it wasn't a five minute task to tear down a tree house and there were at least a few days between OP deciding it needed to come down and actually do it, they could've told the son \"hey, this is happening in X days, if you want to see it one last time you have until then\".", "This is a very valid concern. I think OP did the right thing.", "I've heard of families suing the owner of a pool because some moron broke in and went swimming  and died.", "Basically! If it is something that would attract children - pools, trampolines, tree houses, you have an obligation to mitigate its attractiveness.\n\nYou also can\u2019t booby trap your property either. Egregious example: You cannot set up a pressure activated crossbow to shoot at the top of the ladder of an unfenced pool with the intent of hurting someone unlawfully trespassing.", "When those types of cases happen, don't they usually just sue the homeowners insurance policy to pay for the medical bills though and not like the actual individuals? Especially when there's a question of which policy is the primary payer.", "I'm not from the US so i wouldn't know.\n\nI just know that tresspassers shouldn't be able to sue for damages if they get hurt while tresspassing.", "Good question but generally no. (Except in Wisconsin.) If the insurer was the defendant, can you imagine the increase in litigation? Usually, juries are specifically prohibited from being told of insurance.", "There have been cases where a burgler breaks into a business. Something happens, and they die, and the estate sues the business. Also, there have been instances where burglers sue the homeowner for injuries.", "You skipped over some steps that would have been nice to take:\n\n1. Take a look at the treehouse to figure out if it is still structurally safe or not.\n2. Let your son know that you were considering taking the whole thing down for safety reasons.\n3. If you checked and KNEW it was, in fact, structurally unsafe, that would have made it even easier for your son to accept.) If it were still safe, you could still decide to do whatever you felt was best for you; but you would have known that you had more than one option.\n4. But ahole is far too strong a word for either you or your son. You are being a responsible homeowner and parent to the kids at home. I'm sure it is a real loss to your son. That says a lot about the gift you gave him - building the treehouse together and all his happy memories there. Do what you can to share in his sense of loss and to rebond over the joy that treehouse gave you both.", "NTA -  Hindsight is 20/20, had you realized at the time your son would have been upset that you tore it down without telling him about it first, I'm sure you would have.  \n\nYour wife is correct - you went with the most severe option 1st without considering anything else as you focus was to make sure no one got hurt and you didn't get sued. \n\nQuestion: Do you not have a fence around your yard/home?  Were kids actually breaking into your yard and then the tree house?  I'd be concerned that you have kids that are so blatantly trespassing onto your property and do something to take care of that as well.", "I get it. You all did it as a project. He is 23. Really, I think he needs to grow up. There is a lot of inherent danger leaving it up. NTA.", "NAH- your call really and sadly it was the right one because of the teens being up there and safety issues.  I\u2019d be upset about it too if I was your son.  It was a shock and it\u2019s sad to lose a piece of his childhood.  But it was still the right call and he\u2019ll come around.", "NTA.  Sure in retrospect you would have warned him, and I get the feeling you would've if you had any idea he'd be so emotionally affected by it.  \n\n\nPutting up cameras and no trespassing signs for something that hasn't been used for ages and wont be used (maybe your son imagined their kids playing it in someday?) would be an unusual thing for most people to do.    \n\n\nI don't think it's a nuclear option at all, seems practical.  I would apologize to my son about how I wished I'd realized it mattered to him as much as it did, without going overboard.  You did not do anything wrong (unless you'd stated it would be there for eternity), acknowledging his feelings is very important though.", "NTA he doesn\u2019t live there anymore and is not a child. You did nothing wrong", " NTA - my sister lost her absolute shit when my parents sold our childhood house. I don\u2019t see why she had such an attachment to it (she literally carried a brick from the house in her car).\nI guess some people get super weird attachments to memories in physical places. You can\u2019t be expected to enshrine your kids\u2019 stuff especially if it\u2019s a liability for you. Maybe make him a replica with the wood for Christmas/his birthday?", "Easy NTA and frankly your son sounds like he's being kind of a baby over it.", "NAH \nI can understand why he\u2019s upset, you could have at the very least gave him a heads up.", "Definitely NAH, I've seen the comments and I'm glad you realize having a conversation would be valuable.  Sentimental things from our childhood often hurt no matter what, probably saw a direct example of the loss of his childhood.  It's unfortunate but, maybe build him a small replica model or something cool like that for Christmas or gift him a photo with him and the treehouse if you have one.  I don't know, I'm sure you guys will be okay either way but if that happened to me I would appreciate a gesture like that.", "Nah. I definitely understand his hurt. This was something you built together. The memories that went into it are treasured. I probably would have talked to him first. That way he could have been prepared. But you are right about liability and safety. For all you know they are drinking and doing drugs up there too. They had no qualms about trespassing onto your property and going up there which is weird af. If it was abandonded property maybe but you live there.", "NTA. Your intentions were honest and reasonable. Should you have told him? Yeah, and it's reasonable for him to be upset because a significant childhood memory is suddenly gone and it's a shock. But nobody's remotely an asshole here.", "YTA for not even discussing it with him first", "NTA. Others here have commented on the insurance/liability aspect of this, so I\u2019ll skip that and get straight to the thing which you and your son haven\u2019t thought about yet. *If* you are still living at that property, and *if* your son someday has kids, you are both well equipped to build another awesome treehouse. Save a few pieces for nostalgia just in case.", "It sounds like based on other comments, the treehouse came down earlier in the year and the son just found out at Christmas because it was the first time he was able to come home...guy is definitely not an A-H over this.", "Caveat.", "Many, many years ago, in my state in Australia, a kid climbed a fence, that was covered in signs warning of danger, into a power station, and got injured. His mother tried claiming that all the warning signs made it too inviting to a teenager.", "Could also make a memory box, to keep things from his childhood with the wood.", "I'm an Aussie as well. \n\nIf the spiders and snakes don't get em, Darwin will", "I think the \u201cmoron\u201d is typical a younger child unfortunately", "And that sounds rediculous."]}
