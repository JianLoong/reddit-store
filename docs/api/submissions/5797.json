He's going to be upset, because it means a lot to him, but hopefully he'll understand.\n\nGrowing up, our next door neighbor was an older lady who had her son and his children move in shortly before we moved into our own home.  Her son built a treehouse for his son,  but his son wouldn't use it.  He'd rather be inside playing video games or watching TV.  His daughter, who is a year older than I am, and I became friends and we kind of took it over since it wasn't being used.\n\nWhen the dad made it, he had cut out the door hole and had two windows, one on hinges and one that broke.  We talked him into repairing the broken window and found wood to replace the door.  We decorated it, kept blankets and snacks and stuff inside, kept it clean and used a broken broom to sweep it, even rigged a rope and bucket from one window so we wouldn't have to struggle to carry things in.  That was our hang out spot.\n\nCome high school, we stopped using it as much.  She'd sneak up there to smoke or we'd go up there for a bit of nostalgia, but once we found a snake in there, it was all over.\n\nSeveral years later, the older lady had passed away and her sons had inherited the house.  While cleaning it up, her dad tore down the treehouse.  My dad called my mom, who sat me down and told me that the treehouse was going down.\n\nIt sounds a little silly, but I was sad.  That was a safe place.  That was our hang out place.  We spent so much time there.  We put so much into it.  Your son is sad, he's going to be upset, and that's OK.  He'll come around, but right now he's got to grieve for a big part of his childhood.", "NTA\nI think you had a valid reason.\n\nI would say the only thing you could have done differently was make it known to your son that you were going to take it down.", "NTA.

This is a great post and a sad post all rolled into one.  \n\nIt's great because a father and a 9-year-old boy built a treehouse together, and then used it to create memories in it that were so special the treehouse was still cherished by a 23-year-old man.  That is just amazing!  How many children do something with their dad that has this kind of impact?  Unfortunately, way too few!  \n\nIt's a sad post because, even though OP probably made the responsible choice, the son needed time to process the loss of that treehouse.  Here is what I would do.  Find a picture of your son in the treehouse - one where you see the whole tree house.  Take it to an artist that specializes in drawings from pictures and commission a piece for your son.  My hairstylist wife does these, and they are amazing.  It is something he can have for the rest of his life and might help heal the ache from the loss.

Try and get one of the two of you and make it a really nice present. \n\nBasically, do something to show you understand the loss your son feels about getting rid of a significant part of his childhood.
