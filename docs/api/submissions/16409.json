Its likely that he is doing this to make you dependent on him so that when his behavior gets worse you will have no one to go to for help and no financial means to escape him. I think he is using the age gap to take advantage of and control you. It is not normal for a man to be so controlling and jealous. Please don\u2019t get blinded by whatever love bombing he is subjecting you to or by his degree. I work in academia with many PhDs and MDs.

I don\u2019t mean that in an insulting you must be a gold digger for getting with a doctor sort of way. I don\u2019t think you are. However a lot of people get lured into a false sense of security when they are interacting with doctors because doctors are supposed to help people. Some of the most dysfunctional and narcissistic people I know have MDs or PhDs. It\u2019s alarming that he is tracking your location and has all your passwords. You are entitled to your privacy, whether you are in a relationship or not. You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. His constant paranoia and accusations of cheating are insulting.

This sounds like the beginning of a domestic violence relationship.\n\nETA NTA, and contact your local domestic violence network for information on how to recognize the signs", "BF of SIX MONTHS!", "OP, please take this to heart.   \n\n*I've been there*,  I dated a much older man in my 20's.  He was wonderful in the beginning,  showered me with attention,  love bombing, the works.  I thought of him as my best friend and thought I was so lucky to have someone like him in my life.  \n\nThen,  I started having more of a social life and got involved with my activist group.   I still spent tons of time with him and he was frequently invited to hang out with the group.  Slowly but surely,  his true nature came to the surface.  He became very jealous of all my friends.  I walked on eggshells constantly because if he saw me so much as hug a friend or if I spent too much time chatting with them,  he'd immediately cop a very passive-aggressive attitude.  This is where the emotional abuse started to come into play.   When I went on activist trips, he'd demand my constant attention via text messages and become verbally abusive if he didn't get it.  If I posted a pic of me with a male friend at a protest, (obviously fully clothed, in public,  no hint of intimacy) he'd harass me me about it.  I spent so much time talking to him in the bathroom,  crying on the phone,  while my friends were in the other room having fun.   He started believing that I must be sleeping with any man that interacted with me at all.  *Even gay men*.\n\nHe once caused a scene,  dramatically storming out of my place.  My crime? I was sitting next to my (very openly gay ) friend Martin, who had his arm around me while we watched a movie.    He stormed out another time, too. Why? Because a guy friend of mine was really upset and wanted my advice, so I excused myself to go call him in the other room, I was on the phone for maybe 30 minutes.   He mentally tortured me any time I spent time with anyone else.  He did everything he could to isolate me.  This is a common tactic among abusers.  They don't want us to have anyone in our lives who could help us realize we're being abused and tell us that we deserve better.   They also know that if we're around good people, we will have examples of what HEALTHY relationships are supposed to be like.  That healthy relationships are NOT about control, emotional abuse, and irrational jealousy.  Anyone who could potentially point out that we're being abused is THREAT to the abuser. \n\nLet me tell you,  hon.  It does not get better,  only much worse.  Towards the end of our relationship, I could barely smile at a waiter without him turning abusive.   That's the thing about jealous control freaks, the more you give in to their demands, the more demands they'll make.  Those demands will get increasingly more unreasonable and unhinged.   The abuser will get more and more delusional in their jealous beliefs.  I'll give you an example: my ex once asked me, in all seriousness,  *if I ever had incestuous thoughts about male relatives*.\n\nYou do not deserve this.   You deserve a partner who will love and support you for who you are.  Who will lift you up and encourage you to live your best life.  Someone who will not try to crush your spirit until you are a broken doll for them to possess.  A loving partner will want you to have friends and a life outside of your relationship because *that's healthy*.   They will not treat every man that comes near you as a threat.  They will TRUST you. \n\nWhen I finally broke up with my ex,  he began stalking and harassing me.  He threatened to harass employers,  my dad,  and to post very intimate details to Facebook  to shame me in front of my family.  I'm not someone who is easily scared,  but I truly began to worry for my safety and the safety of every man in my life.  He was acting truly unhinged, and I could see him pulling an \"if I can't have her,  no one can!\" attack.   One of the things controlling abusers fear most is the object of their control (who they see as a possession) escaping them.  It took a call to the police,  multiple threats of a restraining order,  a call to his adult son and several of my friends confronting him before he left me alone.   I've been free of him for 8 years.  I'm one of the lucky ones. \n\nPlease leave this guy.  But be aware,  if he feels you slipping away,  he will absolutely turn on the emotional manipulation,  cry and beg for another chance,  promise he'll change.  It's all lies and an act.   Reach out to friends and family to have a support system in place to help protect you.  My friends were amazing in helping me get away from him,  I'm truly forever grateful. \n\nSorry for the novel length post,  I'm just truly concerned for you.
