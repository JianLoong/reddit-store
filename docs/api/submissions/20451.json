Since I work a lot right now I didn't plan anything, thinking I could invite some friends and families out for a simple lunch picknick or something later. \n\nWhen I got home from work on Friday afternoon, I was surprised with a small gathering. Some of my friends had planned and cooked for a BBQ in my small garden. \nIt was absolutely lovely. Food was delicious, drinks lovely and cute (non alcoholic cause I don't drink) and they decorated my place and garden, cat themed. Even my grumpy old cat had a little bowtie. Love cats! \n\nAnyhow, night was amazing and they all left happy. \nThe morning after I began work at 6.30 and only plowed through the mess left behind, thinking they be in contact later about the cleaning since it was \"their\" party.\n\nI'm currently saving up for a car and so I'm working two jobs om the weekends and sometimes the rest of the week too. \nAt 14.30 I got home to change my clothes, eat something and rush away to job number two. Nobody had still not contacted me about cleaning and my house was still a mess with piling dishes, trash and furniture needing to be moved back. Still thinking they would help, I sent a text asking which time they planned on coming by to help with the clean up. I would be home about eight. \n\nDidn't get answers except from one saying she was working today and tomorrow. \n\nMy Sunday looks the same and since I didn't get an answer I sent another text asking for help with the clean up, adding I'll work ten hours on both Monday and Tuesday, so this evening would be easiest if they're busy with work on those days. \n\nGot some answers about how they didn't have time right now, they needed to rest for the work week, didn't have babysitter's and they wasn't involved in the planing. \nThis really made me upset. I didn't ask for a party, I specifically told them that I didn't have time for a party at the moment, but now I'm stuck with cleaning up after a party. \n\nSoo on Sunday evening after work at eight, I texted again, asking who wanted to come over to help. Not a single soul answered. \nThe dishes had began to smell at this point so I didn't want to leave it any longer. I don't have a dishwasher and the cleanup took forever. \nWhen done after a few hours I sent a text. I know I was a bit snarky, I essentially texted \"I've cleaned everything by my self, no need for you guys to come over and help.\" I'm aware I'm the asshole for that text but I was exhausted and just wanted to sleep.\n\nOn Monday my phone blew up with upset texts on how they planned to help me, that I could have wait, that I wasn't fair and that I'm to pushy needing to have everything done at my place and way.\n\nI'm shocked. I didn't know my \"friends\" thought of me like that. I have no interest in seeing them right now but I'm thinking I light be the asshole. Maybe cleanup isn't something you asks about after a part?\n\nSo, reddit.

Their loss really.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nHow did your friends get into your house?  If you came home to a surprise party that you didn't ask for... then no matter how much you enjoyed it, the whole party became tarnished when your friends left you with a big mess to clean up afterwards.  Especially if you literally didn't have the time to do that.... because there was no planning of your days beforehand as to when was a good time to throw a party.\n\nI wonder what the ones that are most upset would feel if they were in the same situation as you.\n\nYou aren't just cleaning up after yourself and another... but after a whole party.\n\nChange your locks and make sure they don't have a key to your house to do this again.  It doesn't mean you don't end up at another surprise party.  You might... it just won't be at your place where you have to clean the lot because no one else will help.\n\nIt's not like they were young friends either ie you weren't all 18.", "NTA. Organising a party for someone without checking with them about the timing and then leaving them with the entire cleanup effort is a pretty shitty thing to do. And two days of unwashed dishes is way more than I would be able to stand.", "ESH\n\nWhen you plan the party, you plan the cleanup... basic decency. Especially if you had expressed that you didn't have time for this sort of thing.\n\nI don't think your friends have some ulterior motive. They went out of their way to do something nice for you. They just didn't want to deal with the aftermath. \n\nThat said, you got very passive-aggressive and very quickly. You could have just asked if anyone could help clean up since you are slammed this week. If they say no, it is what it is. It's not worth losing a friendship over.", "Okay, I can see now that I'm the asshole. \n\nThe party was amazing, I just wish they'd respected my wishes not to do something right now and wait a while until life wasn't hectic as hell. But maybe this was the day that suited them the best. \nI do think I acted in affect and reacted to strongly. Got nothing to blaim except exhaustion and stress and then get a big surprise task shoved under my nose kinda broke my brain. \nThey did an amazing thing and I acted ungrateful. Don't get me wrong, I thanked them during the party and during the texts to. It's only on the last one I was a bit snarky.\n\nFor future references, how long is it \"normal\" to wait for response and help? I really thought two days, a weekend, was enough time to wait hem it involved dishes and trash. \nAnd I never had a surprise party so I didn't now what the etikett for the \"aftermath\" was. So in the future I'll be thankful for anyone that helps.\n\nI'm gonna apologize to my friends.\n\nThank you Reddit for teaching me to be s decent human.", "YTA...\n\nI'm sorry to say this, but I feel like your side of the story might be a lot different to theirs...\n\n>On Monday my phone blew up with upset texts on how they planned to help me, that I could have wait, that I wasn't fair and that I'm to pushy needing to have everything done at my place and way.\n\nThe comment about 'i need everything done at my place', if this is true, maybe they did feel obligated to surprise you at your house... and maybe they were planning to help tidy on a day that worked for you and them.\n\nAlso, I think it's worth pointing out that throwing a party is a huge time-consuming undertaking, and you are very lucky to have friends who would put so much thought into your birthday. The messiness is an inconvenience but you should appreciate the gesture in my opinion. If you carry on like this, you might not be getting many birthday surprises in the future...", "I have mixed feelings about this. Your friends threw you a lovely party.

That\u2019s not okay. You didn\u2019t ask for the party, and they should have taken responsibility for the entire process since they initiated it. It would be completely different had you planned and hosted, since you would have signed up for the hosting duties, but you didn\u2019t because you wanted to avoid it due to other priorities.", "NTA\n\nThe hosts are responsible for the clean up. This is common sense and common courtesy. Your friends should have cleaned up THEIR party before they left your house that night.", "INFO did they do any cleaning up? To me its acceptable to help a little to get rid of the mess, but leave the dishwashing for another day for example. They should have asked, yes, but If the effort is just a little more than you would have to do anyway after 3 days... Its a bit bothersome to get those messages.", "No, they just left.", "I did ask if they wanted to help clean up but I got no answers or they said they were busy. Maybe I'm a stickler but I'm not comfortable with living like that for a longer period of time. For me two days is enough time, but I see that I might be wrong about that.", "Two days with food left overs is not acting quickly. I would have been way more snarky with stinky left over food spoiling in my house much faster than OP was.", "Agree with this. They did something nice and probably didn\u2019t think it all the way through.", "No, you are NTA! It's really shitty of your friends to leave without cleaning up. No one in my circle would even dream of leaving without doing something, ESPECIALLY if they were the one who planned it. Even just offering to help tidy is the polite thing to do and your friends bungled it. Next time, just assign tasks before people leave and knock it out in 10 minutes.", "Ask once if people will help out. If no one works out timing with you within 48 hours, they probably aren't coming to help.\n\nDon't let this affect your self-image or mental health. You're not completely at fault.", "You aren\u2019t the asshole, wtf are you even on about? They effectively trespassed into your home, and messed it the fuck up.", "You are NTA. They should have helped. Do not apologize to them", "You are NOT AN ASSHOLE!", "I don\u2019t see how you have come to the conclusion that you are TA in this situation? All of the responses that I have seen so far say you are NTA which means NOT the AH\u2026 your friends should be ashamed of themselves for letting themselves in and throwing themselves a great bash that they then didn\u2019t bother to help tidy up. I would have been way more snarky with them than you were. Even if you enjoyed the party they were the hosts not you. Horrible friends.", "I don't think you're an AH. I had a friend who would do this, she would insist that everyone had to have blow out birthday celebrations. And she would make this massive mess. And then leave. And wouldn't get it when people were like, \"I honestly would prefer if you didn't come over and do that again\". She was so insistent, I'm doing this nice suprise for you, and be so confused our reaction was, \"no. You inserted yourself into my birthday out of obligation and then leave me a mess I have to clean up on my birthday. That's not nice\".", "Dude, what the heck you are not the asshole! You can be grateful for the party and wish they helped with the cleanup. Communicate what you\u2019ve said here about life being hectic and the cleanup being a huge task to take on yourself. Big parties leave big messes and you didn\u2019t sign up for that, they did! It\u2019s not a fun surprise if you\u2019re responsible for the worst part of it! And had they stuck around for 30 minutes afterwards to tidy up all together it would\u2019ve been done so much faster.", "NTA.  Your friends should've cleaned up before they left. Or held the party somewhere where you didn't get stuck with the clean up.", "Sorry, that's s a spelling mistake. It should say \"pace\". Not at my place. I n\u00e4now it doesn't make me look better but that invalidates that section of your comment. \n\nI do appreciate their gesture. Gosh it was so lovely. I was just upset and stressed over having to deal with party cleanup when I barely have time to eat at home. \n\nHave already sent out an apology text and invited them out for brunch next sunday.", "Typically the ones who throw the post are the ones who tidy. Especially since they threw it by trespassing in OP\u2019s home!", "Wtf is this? They effectively trespassed and trashed OP\u2019s home! Normally it\u2019s up to the people who throw the party to do the damn tidying up!", "Wow. Awesome.", "When you ask people to help clean your home and they say they are busy or don't answer, the answer is no. Yes, it was inconsiderate of them not to clean up before they left after the party. But they aren't a cleaning service you are paying to clean, so you don't get to badger them to do it. ESH.", "It's fine not to want to live that way. That doesn't make you an AH. They WERE inconsiderate, don't get me wrong. You didn't deserve to have that dumped on you.\n\nUnfortunately, if you still want to be friends with these people, you are going to have to let it go and potentially apologize.", "Do not apologise to your friends. They were never going to come & banking on you not wanting to live in the mess for more than 2 days.", "That makes more sense thank you for explaining. There are definitely two sides to this. My only advice would be to try and not let work stress get in the way of friendships/relationships. Easier said than done though!", "Op didn\u2019t request the party. The cleanup after their friends\u2019 use of their home should not be on them too.", "I didn't asked them to clean my house. Just help me pick up after the party they threw. But I know now that is up to the person living there to do. \nI was just upset since I really didn't have time and I expressed that before the party. \nThey did a lovely thing, I just wished they would have chosen another time.", "They are the ones that made the mess. They absolutely should be acting as a cleaning crew in this situation.", "This ^\n\nYou're all adults, no means no.\n\nThey are AH, but hounding them isn't going to change what happened.", "I get it, as I said they should have tidied up before they left, you were right to be upset. But after they blew you off the first time, hounding them to come and clear up the party wasn't the way to go.", "Yes, they should be acting as a cleaning crew, but they still aren't one. There is zero point in repeatedly demanding something you have no power to demand."]}
