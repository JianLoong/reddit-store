Since I work a lot right now I didn't plan anything, thinking I could invite some friends and families out for a simple lunch picknick or something later. \n\nWhen I got home from work on Friday afternoon, I was surprised with a small gathering. Some of my friends had planned and cooked for a BBQ in my small garden. \nIt was absolutely lovely. Food was delicious, drinks lovely and cute (non alcoholic cause I don't drink) and they decorated my place and garden, cat themed. Even my grumpy old cat had a little bowtie. Love cats! \n\nAnyhow, night was amazing and they all left happy. \nThe morning after I began work at 6.30 and only plowed through the mess left behind, thinking they be in contact later about the cleaning since it was \"their\" party.\n\nI'm currently saving up for a car and so I'm working two jobs om the weekends and sometimes the rest of the week too. \nAt 14.30 I got home to change my clothes, eat something and rush away to job number two. Nobody had still not contacted me about cleaning and my house was still a mess with piling dishes, trash and furniture needing to be moved back. Still thinking they would help, I sent a text asking which time they planned on coming by to help with the clean up. I would be home about eight. \n\nDidn't get answers except from one saying she was working today and tomorrow. \n\nMy Sunday looks the same and since I didn't get an answer I sent another text asking for help with the clean up, adding I'll work ten hours on both Monday and Tuesday, so this evening would be easiest if they're busy with work on those days. \n\nGot some answers about how they didn't have time right now, they needed to rest for the work week, didn't have babysitter's and they wasn't involved in the planing. \nThis really made me upset. I didn't ask for a party, I specifically told them that I didn't have time for a party at the moment, but now I'm stuck with cleaning up after a party. \n\nSoo on Sunday evening after work at eight, I texted again, asking who wanted to come over to help. Not a single soul answered. \nThe dishes had began to smell at this point so I didn't want to leave it any longer. I don't have a dishwasher and the cleanup took forever. \nWhen done after a few hours I sent a text. I know I was a bit snarky, I essentially texted \"I've cleaned everything by my self, no need for you guys to come over and help.\" I'm aware I'm the asshole for that text but I was exhausted and just wanted to sleep.\n\nOn Monday my phone blew up with upset texts on how they planned to help me, that I could have wait, that I wasn't fair and that I'm to pushy needing to have everything done at my place and way.\n\nI'm shocked. I didn't know my \"friends\" thought of me like that. I have no interest in seeing them right now but I'm thinking I light be the asshole.

Don't get me wrong, I thanked them during the party and during the texts to. It's only on the last one I was a bit snarky.\n\nFor future references, how long is it \"normal\" to wait for response and help? I really thought two days, a weekend, was enough time to wait hem it involved dishes and trash. \nAnd I never had a surprise party so I didn't now what the etikett for the \"aftermath\" was.

This is common sense and common courtesy. Your friends should have cleaned up THEIR party before they left your house that night.", "INFO did they do any cleaning up? To me its acceptable to help a little to get rid of the mess, but leave the dishwashing for another day for example. They should have asked, yes, but If the effort is just a little more than you would have to do anyway after 3 days... Its a bit bothersome to get those messages.", "No, they just left.", "I did ask if they wanted to help clean up but I got no answers or they said they were busy.

No one in my circle would even dream of leaving without doing something, ESPECIALLY if they were the one who planned it.

You can be grateful for the party and wish they helped with the cleanup. Communicate what you\u2019ve said here about life being hectic and the cleanup being a huge task to take on yourself.

They simply do not care about her or her life. \n\nShe did not plan the party nor did she want one especially where she had to do all the clean-up.", "If you live alone, there is a vast difference in dishes between your normal ones for 3 days - OP may not even eat at home every day, working TEN HOUR days -- and a party with at least 6 or 7 people. That's a ridiculous amount of dishes to leave for your friend to handwash.", ">but you seem very snarky and like you like things done your way and at your pace too. \n\n\"Done your way\" = done at all.\n\n\"At your pace\" = not dirty dishes sitting around for a week.\n\nAm I about right?", "ONLY WORK 10 HOURS Christ.\n\nAnd she literally said she doesn't have a dishwasher in the post.", "Oh hunnie. Idk where you live but I\u2019ll be your friend. Cuz your friends suck. I have def helped throw surprise parties before and usually people stick around and help clean up (or just have it somewhere else - a restaurant etc). I have also had surprise parties thrown for me many years ago and even as a 16 yo my friends were more considerate. It\u2019s not a good surprise if it adds stress to someone\u2019s life. That\u2019s a shitty surprise.", "You 100% are not the asshole. It is not normal to make a giant mess at your friends' house and just bounce. Don't let a few votes convince you it's okay for your friends to walk all over you.", "Garden = backyard.\n\nYou don't need a key to get in the yard in most places.", "Awesome!! Glitter sticks to everything within reach!! I'm laughing even as I think about it.", "I am right there with you on that!! There would never again be a party at my place because locks would be immediately changed and no one would be allowed in. Those people just wanted a party and used her as a reason to throw one without having to lift a finger after.", "SWEET do you got a buddy willing to pee in his sneakers or do I gotta bring my own?", "And also, if you have a party at a friends house you would sort of clean up during the party. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019m used to. You pick up empty bottles while getting new drinks, refill snacks etc. And if you\u2019re one of the few who are there till the end of the night you definitely help with the clean up. It\u2019s just common decency.", "Sounds like it was a garden party - depending where the OP lives, the garden may have little to no security. Where I live it's not uncommon for garden gates to just have a latch and some people's gardens you can just leap the fence. \n\nSo house may not be involved.", "Me too! I\u2019m an evil little lady!", "What?! So I can just come into your home, \u201cthrow you a party\u201d, and bounce, and that\u2019s being a good friend to you? \n\nNo. They\u2019re assholes, and they SHOULD feel shitty.", "Agreed", "When the dishes start to smell, it is definitely time to clean (actually a bit beyond). \n\nNTA. Happy Birthday! go get some new friends! Celebrate freedom from folks who just hang around for the fun part.", "NTA.  The people who created the mess should have stayed to clean it up.  You didn\u2019t invite them over or plan the event, and cleanup is part of that.  Expecting you to live in their mess until it was convenient for them to take care of it also makes them TA.  You can\u2019t leave dirty dishes sitting around indefinitely.  It\u2019s unsanitary and can create a health hazard.", "Nope NTA, they should\u2019ve helped clean up the mess afterwards or hired a cleaning service since it was a party that THEY PLANNED.", "NTA. Who doesn't help clean up???", "I feel bad for you", "That's crazy. My friends will offer to clean up after a party even if I'm the one who planned it. And I do the same and friends' houses. I'm sorry your friends did this to you - very rude. NTA.", "Ok so wash the dishes. It's just dishes and some garbage. Unless there were 100 people there it won't take a week to clean it up. Fill the sink with soapy water and dishes, let them soak for ten minutes, wash, rinse, repeat. While the dishes are soaking you can fill a bag with trash. In under 2 hours you can have the place cleaned up and back to normal. If someone lives on their own it's not a huge place and they don't have a huge amount of dishes to wash.", "NTA. Your \"friends\" are jerks. You should have asked them how long should you have waited... until everything was moldy? It was already beginning to smell. Sounds like The little red hen", "NTA- if I threw a friend a party you can be 100% sure I\u2019m also gonna do the clean up. It\u2019s not your responsibility to clean up a mess from something they planned! And also surprised you with! I\u2019d definitely have a talk with them about that", "YTA for listening to my favourite murder", "If it's so easy why don't you go over and do it for OP", "NTA at all\n\nI\u2019m only 23 and even when I was younger\u2014high school, before, etc\u2014it\u2019s just been common sense that you help clean up after an event. Why wouldn\u2019t you? You\u2019re at someone else\u2019s house, you\u2019ve made a mess, and leaving them to clean it takes away from the joy of the actual party/event! We always clean up the same day, since people are already there. With all hands on deck, it goes MUCH faster. I find it really odd that your friends would just\u2026leave. But it\u2019s much much worse to also never agree to come back to help (and their claims that they \u201cplanned\u201d to help are BS). I feel like they don\u2019t really understand\u2026cleaning. Like you said, the dishes were already smelling within a few days. Did they just expect you to live with that for ages? When you need clean dishes???\n\nI\u2019ve seen people discuss how, when you give someone flowers as a gift, it\u2019s helpful to already have them completely prepped; trimmed, in a vase, arranged, watered, etc. because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re not just giving them a gift, you\u2019re giving them a task. A forced time and effort commitment that isn\u2019t really enjoyable (for most people. Hey, if you like arranging your own bouquets like I do, Hell yeah), and takes away from the gift a bit. By throwing you the party, they gave you a gift. By not cleaning up afterwards, they burdened you with a task.", "NTA - They got all the fun parts of planning and having a party and left the lame part to the person the party was for.\n\nI can't imagine staging a surprise party and not having clean up just already be planned to be a thing done by the 'hosts'. Even if it was 'hosted' at the honorees house.", "Unt un NTA \u2026 any time we have parties we clean up right before we leave ! Had you kept waiting on them you\u2019d end up with gnats / maggots / mold on dishes etc . They never planned to help but want to make you look bad for it . You weren\u2019t wrong !", "In my mid 20's this was the way and my younger friends were *more* this way than I was.", "Well, if you remain friends with them, make sure to tell them next year that if they throw another party at your house they had best clean up before they leave the premises or expect a bill for the cleaning service. I cannot imagine even leaving your house that evening without cleaning....where your friends raised in a barn?! NTA", "Right, that was definitely just BS they said to try to make themselves look/feel better.\n\nIf they had any intent to help, they would\u2019ve worked harder to make it work in their schedules. Even if they were busy on the days OP suggested and 100% TRULY couldn\u2019t do those, that\u2019s when you say \u201cdoes ____ work instead?\u201d", "Right? If cleaning needs to be done and you were part of the mess. Clean. Its not hard. Hell even if you weren't part of the mess, just... help.", "So if i come into your house with a cake, then take have unintentional explosive diarrhea in your bathroom and refuse to clean it up for two days, you become the AH for asking me to clean it up?", "If you can't see the difference between an adult reminding other adults about their responsibilities i.e. not letting people walk over them and a toddler throwing a tantrum, i might have some bad news for you", "But OP mentioned a bunch of dishes that were beginning to smell and needed washing. So either they had access to her dishes or they brought their own and left them there. Really should have brought paper plates that can just be tossed, though.", "Do people even read the comments they relpy to? I specifically said they were inconsiderate. And my whole point was, THEY don't feel guilty. All the OP's badgering accomplished is make them defensive and her feel worse.", "If you expect a very sick person to help you clean then and there, I don't know what to tell you. Also, I didn't say the OP is the AH, in fact I specifically said she was right.", "Very sick person? I\u2019ve had diarrhea without being sick, just some quick glitch in digestion. My point is that you think that if someone\u2019s messes up your home and doesn\u2019t feel guilty for not cleaning it up, you become an AH for asking them to. \n\nYou literally judged it as E S H, which translates to you thinking both OP and her friends are AH. So yes you did call her an AH", "If you consider repeated texts of \"when are you coming to clean?\", after they already told you they aren't coming, as reminding them of their responsibilities, I also have bad news for you.", "Point, but does depend on when they started cooking. If the party started with \"surprise! Um, mind getting some plates please?\". \n\nBut yeah, if they were able to get in the house somehow, probs best not to allow that any longer.", "Okay fix your eyes dude. She texted them three times before the snarky text. Friday evening she as the party, she texted them Saturday evening (which no one replied to). Then she texted them Sunday afternoon saying Sunday night would be the best to clean due to her work schedule(to which a couple said they were busy resting), then she texted them Sunday night for a final request before cleaning it herself and then being passive aggressive about it. \n\nMaybe instead of 3 times she could\u2019ve texted 2 times but it\u2019s not really that big of a difference", "NTA\n\nWhoever throws the party organises the cleanup.\n\nThis means that they either spend thirty minutes at the end tidying, or at worst they organise it for the next day.\n\nThrowing someone a surprise party and then saddling them with the full cleanup on their own is an asshole move. That is not a gift, that is an obligation."]}
