Since I work a lot right now I didn't plan anything, thinking I could invite some friends and families out for a simple lunch picknick or something later. \n\nWhen I got home from work on Friday afternoon, I was surprised with a small gathering. Some of my friends had planned and cooked for a BBQ in my small garden. \nIt was absolutely lovely. Food was delicious, drinks lovely and cute (non alcoholic cause I don't drink) and they decorated my place and garden, cat themed. Even my grumpy old cat had a little bowtie. Love cats! \n\nAnyhow, night was amazing and they all left happy. \nThe morning after I began work at 6.30 and only plowed through the mess left behind, thinking they be in contact later about the cleaning since it was \"their\" party.\n\nI'm currently saving up for a car and so I'm working two jobs om the weekends and sometimes the rest of the week too. \nAt 14.30 I got home to change my clothes, eat something and rush away to job number two. Nobody had still not contacted me about cleaning and my house was still a mess with piling dishes, trash and furniture needing to be moved back. Still thinking they would help, I sent a text asking which time they planned on coming by to help with the clean up. I would be home about eight. \n\nDidn't get answers except from one saying she was working today and tomorrow. \n\nMy Sunday looks the same and since I didn't get an answer I sent another text asking for help with the clean up, adding I'll work ten hours on both Monday and Tuesday, so this evening would be easiest if they're busy with work on those days. \n\nGot some answers about how they didn't have time right now, they needed to rest for the work week, didn't have babysitter's and they wasn't involved in the planing. \nThis really made me upset. I didn't ask for a party, I specifically told them that I didn't have time for a party at the moment, but now I'm stuck with cleaning up after a party. \n\nSoo on Sunday evening after work at eight, I texted again, asking who wanted to come over to help. Not a single soul answered. \nThe dishes had began to smell at this point so I didn't want to leave it any longer. I don't have a dishwasher and the cleanup took forever. \nWhen done after a few hours I sent a text. I know I was a bit snarky, I essentially texted \"I've cleaned everything by my self, no need for you guys to come over and help.\" I'm aware I'm the asshole for that text but I was exhausted and just wanted to sleep.\n\nOn Monday my phone blew up with upset texts on how they planned to help me, that I could have wait, that I wasn't fair and that I'm to pushy needing to have everything done at my place and way.\n\nI'm shocked. I didn't know my \"friends\" thought of me like that. I have no interest in seeing them right now but I'm thinking I light be the asshole. Maybe cleanup isn't something you asks about after a part?\n\nSo, reddit.

This is common sense and common courtesy. Your friends should have cleaned up THEIR party before they left your house that night.", "INFO did they do any cleaning up? To me its acceptable to help a little to get rid of the mess, but leave the dishwashing for another day for example. They should have asked, yes, but If the effort is just a little more than you would have to do anyway after 3 days... Its a bit bothersome to get those messages.", "No, they just left.", "I did ask if they wanted to help clean up but I got no answers or they said they were busy.

No one in my circle would even dream of leaving without doing something, ESPECIALLY if they were the one who planned it.

Next time, just assign tasks before people leave and knock it out in 10 minutes.", "Ask once if people will help out.

You can be grateful for the party and wish they helped with the cleanup. Communicate what you\u2019ve said here about life being hectic and the cleanup being a huge task to take on yourself.

And doing it at OP\u2019s house was a wrong move for sure- they could\u2019ve asked if she wanted a party there at least too", "you i\u2019ll p", " They won\u2019t be talking about the great time you guys all had, they\u2019ll now just talk about this situation.", "Cleaning up after a party shouldn\u2019t get done any other time than immediately after.", "Happy birthday!  Here are some dirty dishes!", ">Real friends would have tidied as the party progressed and left your place better than they'd found it.\n\nYep. If they knew time would be tight to clean up at the end, they could have used paper plates that just get binned at the end, rather than dumping a bunch of dirty dishes on someone without a dishwasher.", "And why did they ignore your texts?", "Two days of stinks is normal? I want to see your house", "NTA  I don't know who leaves a mess after a party. It's one thing to host and decide not to fully clean up until the next day.... But that's something *you* would plan.  Cleaning up after a party doesn't usually take that long, add long as most people help. 1-2 people picks up trash and takes that bag to the bin and put in a new bag. 1-2 gathering all the dishes and scraping them off. 1-2 people putting food away.  Without a dishwasher, 1-2 people to wash and dry dishes. Honestly, you shouldn't have let them leave without cleaning. \"*Thanks for the surprise party guys! It was so much fun, but I really need help with cleaning up\"*\n\nIf you want to be a bit petty, you can apologize. Tell them you lived the party, what you lived about it, they you had a great time.  Then you can apologize \"I didn't mean to take my frustration out on you guys, I've just been a little stressed with working 2 jobs / XY hours per week. I think the smells of the left over trash just put me over the edge. \ud83e\udd2a\"\n\nYour friends were shitty leaving you to clean up after the entire event. An event that you didn't even plan. When my friends host, unless someone has to leave early, everyone always offers to clean up some how. Loading up the dishwasher, putting food away, and moving furniture back goes by real fast with 1-2 people doing each task than 1 person alone.", "How did you reach the conclusion that you are TA? Clearly not the case here OP!", "Personally, you shouldn't apologize, I'd be raising hell if that happened to me, especially if they used real plates and dishware and cookware, and I didn't have a dishwasher, and they left me to do all the cleaning. They knew you didn't have the bandwidth for this. They did this party for them with the excuse being your birthday. If they didn't want to clean, they absolutely should have used disposable shit. Plus, the whole \"we were going to help but we didn't have the time\" is also bullshit, if they didn't help right after or in the next day or two, they absolutely never planned on helping. When using real plates and cookware, you don't wait a whole weekend to go back and help clean at that point, you clean right away so it's easier to do and faster.\nYou are NTA at all and way nicer than I would have been.", "You don't owe them an apology. They threw you a party and made a mess of your home. They are the ones who are not behaving decently in the situation.\n\nPoor planning on their part should not constitute an emergency on yours.", "You're not the asshole! Don't apologize!", "I\u2019m sorry that you are dealing with both the mess and so-called friends. Perhaps seeing the Internet ooh and aah over your grumpy bow-tied boy would bring a smile to your face? Cat Tax, please.", "And you would've had the same outcome, but looked like as equal an ass as they would be. Congrats", "Let me correct that for you, \u201c.. Sorry you\u2019re dealing with BOTH messes (the party rubbish and the so-called friends)\u201d lol", "You sound like the non tidying up messy party hosts. Don\u2019t throw parties at other people\u2019s houses if you aren\u2019t going to help tidy up your mess.", "OP I think u need to lose some friends. Real friends would have cleaned up asap without being asked.", "Please don't accept the AH judgment! The rule is, that if you throw a party, you clean up afterwards. Your \"Friends\" wanted a BBQ, and didn't want the responsibly of cleaning later. Stop being a doormat, and find a better group of people who will treat you better. \u270c\ud83d\udc9c", " I would have sucked it up and cleaned, rather than waiting for the dishes to start to smell. Sorry but that's just gross.", "Not even that, if you ENJOY A PARTY HOSTED AT SOMEONES HOUSE, it is COMMON COURTESY to help clean the host house after the fact. My mom used to throw weekend long bangers, nobody was allowed to go home Sunday until the house was clean top to bottom. And since everyone had been drinking nobody had their Keys until I unlocked my key safe I kept in my room for said parties (no drunk drivers on our families watch)", "Nah, you wouldn't have, cos you're a bot.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14hmovj/comment/jpci26e/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3"]}
