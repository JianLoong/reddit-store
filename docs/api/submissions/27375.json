He reacted the way he should. They sexually assaulted you. The school should do something. Get your dad to go ballistic on the school. When they bully say that you are going to tell your dad. Stop normalizing these dumbasses to continue doing it. Stand talk and call the cops. \nYour dad is protecting you as best he could. Don\u2019t hate him. He is protecting his child. Let him go ballistic. Sue the school, the district, everyone for allowing you to be sexually assaulted.", "NTA   \nYour dad should sue the school too for letting this happen. I'm sorry for what's happening to you. This goes beyond simple bullying.", "NTA\n\nWhat Peter and David did to you is likely Sexual Assault, and you could go to the police and have them taken to jail.  This is not just your average bullying, they\u2019ve committed a legitimate crime against you.  \n\nAnd you haven\u2019t ruined your reputation forever.  I can guarantee that as a former bullied kid in high school.  I\u2019m now in my 30s with a great job making great money.  I won\u2019t lie, your social life while in HS may take a hit.  But I can also guarantee that in four years, none of that shit will matter.  Best of luck to you with whatever you decide to do.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t ever let someone call you a snitch for molesting you. Press charges and sue their pants off.", "NTA. To me, this is beyond bullying. This can be considered as sexual harassment since they touched you appropriately. Your dad's anger is justified, because if I found out my child is going through this, I would absolutely do the same. OP I hope you'd get some help if this has affected you deeply, please tell your parents and the principal about the continuous bullying even after they found out your dad sued their parents. Don't ever wish harm on yourself, no one deserves to be bullied. You did not ruin your reputation, you were simply protecting yourself :)", "NTA, but I'm going be real and frank with you. These guys sexually assaulted you. You need to stop worrying about your self image in front of them and worry about your own safety. I've been through what you been through. From 1st grade to 8th grade I was beaten up, emotionally attacked, cyber bullied and everything else in the book. Yes the teachers kind of help but could also tell by some of their looks they thought I deserved it. One thing I learned from it and I learnt this by my grandparents who stood by me. Take no crap from anyone. They ain't going stop if you just take the abuse. Now I'll admit the reason why some stopped picking on me is because I snapped and slammed a few on their behinds. Truthfully it should of never gotten to that point but it did. You got a choice to keep it from going to that point. Tell your dad what going on so he can take care of it. There no problem with having your family fight your battles if they are willing to. So let him fight the battle and you focus on your own health and not how others see you.", "NTA\n\nYou were sexually assaulted. That is a crime. They deserve worse than a lawsuit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

In this situation, anger is a natural reaction towards the juvenile delinquents who have bullied and now sexually assaulted his son. He's trying to protect you. He might not make a perfect job if it, but action is called for here to stop their behavior. They weren't going to stop on their own; they would keep escalating. \n\nPlease talk to your parents or your primary physician about getting mental health assistance to work through what's already happened against your will and to get through the battle to come. \n\nI'm sorry for what you're going through.", "Your father should call the police.  You are being sexually abused and that is a crime in most places.", "Nope nope nope. NTA. You are under reacting. This is not school bullying. You have been assaulted, it just happened to happen in a school building. A lawyer is one of several authorities you should involve but let your parents handle all that. I believe you would benefit greatly from speaking to a counselor, outside of school. Please tell your folks that you think it\u2019s a good idea. You need to process through some of this as it\u2019s happening. You don\u2019t deserve this OP, regardless of how awkward you think you are. Plenty of awkward folks here ;P We support you", "Your dad is right. You aren't \"letting\" him do anything. He's the parent, it is his job to protect you. Your job is to let him protect you.\n\nOP, what you're going through is terrible. This isn't even remotely normal. They've terrorized you so much you seem to be becoming avoidant and permissive of the abuse. Not only should you tell your dad that the abuse continues, please record it if you can. Also, just to be on the safe side, bring the issue to the attention of the school counselor. Just so there is a record of it.\n\nI'm not trying to scare you, OP but there was a case where a student had his life cut short by violent bullies. You never know how things will turn out. Please, please tell your dad.\n\nNTA", "Nta they are not bullying you they are sexually assaulting you \n\nPlease tell your parents and get them dealt with butcher authorities"]}
