When I get it close to my face I notice it smells really bad, I was a bit confused because I had just got that towel from the clean stack. I shrug it off and grab a new one. \n\nTwo days later I grab my towel to shower and I noticed it smelled bad again. This makes me wonder what\u2019s going on. My first thought was my brother using my towel but then I went nah, he keeps his towels in his room and his are black while mines are teal so he couldn\u2019t have got them confused. I just chalk it up to me leaving them too wet and they get mildew buildup.\n\nYesterday I go to shower and again my towel smells bad but this time it has marks on it. That\u2019s when I knew it wasn\u2019t me. I march in the living room and confront my brother about it. He just casually admits that he uses my towel when he forgets his. When he says this I feel sick and call him disgusting. He tells me to calm down and says he uses it after he showers so he\u2019s clean. I told him he\u2019s doing something wrong because he\u2019s not clean after he showers. \n\nOur mom steps in and says that was unnecessary. I told her go look at the state of my towel and tell me that\u2019s not gross. She goes look and when she comes back she\u2019s like yeah that\u2019s nasty. Dad then says it can\u2019t be that bad and then he goes look. He comes and goes yep it is that bad. My brother then gets a long lecture on good hygiene. \n\nLater my brother comes to me and says I\u2019m an asshole for embarrassing him like that. I don\u2019t believe I was in the wrong, he was the one leavening my towels in that state. If he saw nothing wrong with that then I think he needed to be told something. I didn\u2019t intentionally call him out in front of our parents, they just happened to be nearby.

And like, rashes and ruined clothes and sheets. 18 is old enough to know that you need to use soap when you clean your Bhole.", "NTA. Clearly he wouldn't have learned anything from just you. Maybe the embarrassment will help him learn and remember. \n\nAlso, I'm a firm believer that parenting doesn't just stop. If your brother didn't know how to shower, I'm glad your parents talked to him about it. It is embarrassing, but he still needed it. \n\nYou know what would have been more embarrassing? Getting the hygiene lecture from a significant other (or, more likely, getting dumped).", "I wish I could launder my eyes and brain after reading that. Yuck. NTA. He obviously needed an intervention before he went out into the world, thinking that was okay.", "NTA You guys are part of a family unit and the conversation came up spontaneously. You didn't wait so you could bring it up in front of them. He's embarrassed, as he should be. Hopefully this will teach him about the need to clean where the sun don't shine. \n\nFor crying out loud, it's not like you outed him for drinking or other forbidden activities. Give him space. Can you keep your towel hanging in your own room and take it with you when you shower?", "NTA if he didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed he should have used his own towels", "NTA. Hygiene talks are always embarrassing to people who aren't clean and it's better coming from family than a stranger, friend, or significant other. But you guys should also be doing laundry more often, running the fan in the bathroom to avoid extra moisture, and not letting him keep towels in his room (?) where they can't dry properly because he probably balls them up where they stay wet.", "NTA and this is why I'm a one use per towel sort of person. Both for the initial mildew thought and the shared/not actually clean reason.", "NTA - ewwwwwwwwwwwww.", "NTA. You didn't embarrass him. He did that to himself.", "NTA. You're his big brother, pat of your job is to mess with him in a way that makes him a better and stronger person.   Your parents used to wipe his ass, so they're ok to get in on the embarrassment. He needed to learn not to use your towel and that he was nasty, good job.", "NTA, your bother was obviously ignoring his own poor hygiene. Let your brother know if he stays embarrassed about his hygiene it will make it harder for him to learn from his mistakes, which will lead to him being embarrassed all over again. Hopefully the attention you brought will be enough to keep that cycle from repeating.", "NTA. Was he wiping his ass with it or something?", "There\u2019s like nothing that could embarrass me in front of my family. Better you guys than future roommates or romantic partners.", "Nta he embarrassed himself. You've actually probably saved him from the embarrassment of a future romantic partner having to tell him how to wash his butthole...", "NTA\n\n\"Later my brother comes to me and says I\u2019m an asshole for embarrassing him like that.\"\n\nSorry, that sort of \"embarrassing him like that\" happens now and then in a family household.

Your nasty brother is taking a shower wrong if he is stinking up the towel. He needs to stop using your towel and wash his ass. You were right for calling him out in front of your parents.

Your brother is kidding himself if he thinks he's the only teenage boy whose never been on the receiving end of a family talk about why he needs to try harder to clean up after himself or keep his body clean. It's an incredibly mundane experience and you shouldn't have to suffer smelly towels because he's lazy.\n\nLord knows there's been tons of stories here about women enduring boyfriends and partners with poor hygiene standards and that's his future if he can't learn to be considerate and clean.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nHe needed to be told he's gross.

I cant imagine anything, if it wasnt makep that wasn't washed off properly??", "You use YOUR TOWELS to clean YOUR FACE and he's wiping poop on them...NTA.

That's gross.", "Damn how bad was it", "Your family, I don\u2019t think it was that embarrassing for him", "Oh thank goodness, I thought I was the only one thinking that.", "Was thinking the same thing.

Washing up there after small business too.
