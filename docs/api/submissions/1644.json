I set the drinks down on the counter beside Dee and proceed to start the next drinks. Simultaneously, Dee is taking an order over the headset, when another customer pulls up to the window and proceeds to whistle at me to get my attention. Nope. I\u2019m not a dog, and it\u2019s not in my training to respond to whistles. Dee can handle this one. \n\nDee stops what she\u2019s doing and snaps at me, in front of the customer at the window. \u201cWhat is wrong with you? Why didn\u2019t you just cash them out? How dare you ignore a customer like that?\u201d The customer at the window has a shit eating grin while my partner berates me. \n\nI stand my ground. \u201cOur SM has been very clear, under no circumstances can we till share. It is a fireable offense.\u201d I look at the customer dead in the face, his shit eating grin turns into a look of offense. I could care less, and continue doing my job. \n\nShe continues to go off. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you. It would have taken 3 seconds to cash him out!\u201d She gets so angry and red faced that she tells the shift she needs to step off the floor because she \u201ccan\u2019t STAND working with\u201d me. Then she goes home early and we\u2019re short staffed until shift change\n\nI suppose I could have avoided the situation if I did what she wanted, but I\u2019m not willing to stick my neck out for a coworker who is awful to me (even in front of customers) at any chance she gets. \n\nAm I the a-hole?", "created_utc": 1667761000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynz2cx/aita_barista_is_mad_at_me_for_refusing_to_till/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It had been happening constantly to the point that if someone stole from a register, there\u2019d be no accountability. \n\nThat being said, there\u2019s really no way to prove if you share a till, because our cameras don\u2019t work. Shifts would still get lazy and not want to count the drawers, so they\u2019d say \u201cyou can use my till for this customer, it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d If a coworker I trusted had their hands full and couldn\u2019t get to a customer right away, I\u2019d have no problem sharing their till even though it\u2019s technically a fireable offense. \n\nI chose not to help Dee both out of pettiness and out of a lack of trust.

What happened was my manager knew I was coming in, in about an hour and decided for some reason to sign in under my number and have the new person work under it and of course it came up short at the end of the night and had there not been cameras or the clock in system to show I wasn't even there when it happened yet I would have been in trouble for stealing!

And you get written up for violating the rules.", "I had gone on break and managers are supposed to count before and after employee switch.  It was to make sure it was even all around.  They didn\u2019t do it that day.  End of the shift it was short close to 60 dollars.  They attempted to make us split it.  My sister found out she\u2019s a manager for same company different store.  She asked if they did that I said no.  Thankfully since they didn\u2019t do that I wasn\u2019t held liable.", "Glad you were able to fight it.", "Still report her to the manager.

Sadly he\u2019s MIA most of the time. On his third vacation atm. Even when he is here, his ADHD is crippling(his words). I can\u2019t count on him to take action. \n\nI\u2019ve brought it up to the SSV who told me the same. I can trust her, but she\u2019s one the few coworkers I have that don\u2019t take Dee\u2019s bullshit. Our store is VERY cliquey. Dee is well liked by the most dramatic baristas. After this happened, they deleted me from the work group chat despite not being there to see what happened. I can only imagine the lies Dee has been spreading about me behind my back"]}
