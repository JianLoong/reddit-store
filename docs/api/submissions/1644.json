I can trust her, but she\u2019s one the few coworkers I have that don\u2019t take Dee\u2019s bullshit. Our store is VERY cliquey. Dee is well liked by the most dramatic baristas.

The reason being, it helps figure out who might be stealing if the registers are often short, or who might not be giving correct change, if they are over.   \nIf people till share, it muddies the waters and makes it much harder to figure out who might the one stealing from a till, or giving back incorrect change.", "NTA", "NTA. Good for you for sticking to the no sharing the till rule. I once worked at a fast food restaurant drive thru that was really busy so I was the order taker, another worker took the money and handed the orders out and a third worker ran the food to the window. One Sunday night, we were short-staffed and the manager who was supposed to handle the money while that coworker was on break flat out refused to come over and told me I had to take the orders and handle the money (in the coworker's till) while my coworker was on her dinner break. I didn't want to do it, but the manager walked away and the drive-thru was backing up so I used the coworker's till while she was on break. The next day when I came in to work, the district manager was there and asked me what happened the night before. I told her that the manager refused to cover my coworker for her break and told me to work the till. Surprise, surprise - suddenly $200 were missing from the till that night! This was the mid-80's so $200 was a good amount of money.  I was told that my coworker and I were both going to be required to pass a polygraph test before we could come back to work. I asked if the manager was going to have to take one as well since he counted the tills at the end of the night and was told, 'No, just you and the coworker'. I freaked out but I scheduled the polygraph as requested (required) for Wednesday. I took the polygraph and passed. I got called on Thursday and was told I could come back to work. I asked about the coworker and they said that her parents refused to let her take the test (she was 17, I was 19). I asked about the manager and was told that he quit (pretty much right after I passed the polygraph so clearly he was just trying to pin this on me). I ended up quitting that job right after the polygraph results came back due to the way I was treated. But I've never forgotten the lesson of never sharing a till.", "Nta, you need your job and she needs to better manage her time so she can do her job. This isn't your fault but you should tell your supervisor because her behavior is unacceptable for a workplace", "NTA. If it\u2019s policy than you are just following the rule. I\u2019ve worked retail and many places don\u2019t want till sharing and for a reason as it makes accountability difficult.  If every one is cashing out of the same register and someone makes a mistake  or intentionally steals it\u2019s hard to know who did it. \n\nOne place I worked at while in college and after college was a small shop and there was only one register and  we didn\u2019t have different logins either. \nSo boss couldn\u2019t tell who did what so when ever a mistake would happen the biggest being someone took an American Express card ( against policy due to high fees) we didn\u2019t know who did it so we all got yelled at which sucked.", "I would file an official complain against Dee with the mgr and if that doesn\u2019t help then with HR!

So a manager can go and ring up on your till, but not vice versa and certainly not a regular employee.\n\nI followed this rule and a manager stole $50 from my till.  I was almost immediately fired, I challenged them to look at the cameras as they were trying to fire me.\n\nYou read correctly, they hadn't even *looked* at the cameras to see how the money went missing.\n\nDon't ever till share with anyone.", "Yo, this screams of a setup", "Hey honestly in case anyone else is reading this and they're ever in this situation, even if they try to say that through the company they want to hold you liable, don't take that.

Because your manager is making excuses not to do his job really.\n\nThis girl hates you and is trying to set you up and then abandoned the shift when it didn't work. If your manager isn't willing to fire someone who walks off the job and tries to break policy, then the workplace is fucked and you shouldn't stay", "The real issue is the camera is not working so your employer is making you all run around to tills. Fix the cameras fix the issue", "First, NTA. SSV here, you're completely correct about it being a fireable offense, so thanks for being one of the baristas that takes it to heart. Maybe just pretend you're swamped on bar\u2014 maybe even take a few cafe drinks to ham it up\u2014 and really, really can't help Dee cash someone out (wink wink). Besides, most SSVs prefer you stay planted unless we give you a secondary position; having someone on bar and also taking cash is unsanitary and interrupts the flow, and doesn't really happen unless we tell you to drive bar at the end of the night.\n\nIf possible, let your assistant manager know about Dee (not all stores have one). If your manager is as MIA as you say he is, your district manager is always there to support you should Dee try to escalate her behavior, and their numbers are generally available in the back of house. If their number isn't available, you can go into another store in your district on your day off and ask them- someone's gotta know! Maybe get your buddy-SSV to back you up! However, your DM may not be deem this enough of a problem to take action, so keep that in mind.\n\nUnfortunately, there's not much support SSVs can give regarding cliques unless the behavior escalates into something that requires a coaching or write up (though Dee's berations in front of customers should have probably already earned her a few) so transferring to another store in your district might relieve your stresses.\n\nI'm sorry that this has been troubling you! Best of luck, and good job dealing with Dee!", "NTA you were following the policy that was communicated to you , she was on drive through, it is her job to handle it not yours", "You need to tell your manager she tried to force you to till share and yelled at you in front of a customer when you refused.", "I was thinking the same thing, this girl Dee wants OP to get fired and is mad it didn't work", "I'd probably try to sugar coat that she could be called a thief if she till shared. After all, if was in the meeting and all. \n\nBut I can be a petty asshole. When I did drive thru for Wendy's I made sure **no one** touched my till because that had happened in the past and I was given the blame when I wasn't at fault."]}
