{"id": 29578, "submission_id": "17fef0u", "title": "AITA for complaining to my friends that my gf is so cheap?", "selftext": "My gf makes a lot of money around $130k as a software engineer. I\u2019m also in tech but as a C++ gaming developer I only make $75k. I\u2019m thinking of switching now since the gaming industry definitely takes advantage of us. \n\nShe is really cheap and her family isn\u2019t poor by any means, they have multiple rental properties. She has 2 properties herself, one we live in and split expenses and a duplex she rents out. I do get lower than market rent which I appreciate and with a cat it\u2019s hard to find places to begin with. But other than that she is really cheap. She had a 180k mile car that has broken down twice and the mechanic and I have both told her to replace it. But she finally did when it broke on the highway and she got a $14k car and was sad her savings went down. She could buy a lambo in cash at this point and not be in trouble but she is soooo cheap. She saw a $23k car she liked a lot more but went with the cheaper car instead. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t eat dinner often to save money. Intermittent fasting is now a thing but she\u2019s been doing it since college to save money. She has remained trim which is rare with a desk job but she does it purely to save money. She never eats out and will bring a Tupperware to lunch and then fast until breakfast which is always oatmeal and a banana. I\u2019ve lost weight living with her but man is it boring. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to take her out but when I do I have to snatch the bill away from her so she doesn\u2019t see it. If she does she would probably faint especially with today\u2019s prices. She never eats out because of the price and it\u2019s hard to get her to even order a drink with a meal because she is so use to never drinking anything but water because she feels like even a pop or juice is too expensive. \n\nA bunch of friends and I were going out of eat and they were talking about vacations and I mentioned a vacation we took to Hawaii. There was the option to direct fly or layovers which was double the time. It was $200 a ticket more for the direct flight but would save us 6h and I convinced her(after lots of back and forth) to take the shorter trip but she was not happy. She also insisted we stay at a Airbnb campsite in someone\u2019s backyard in Hawaii because hotel rooms were expensive. We also still cooked every meal from a camping stove she had. I was a bit tipsy and told this story and people my friend were shocked because who goes to Hawaii and does this? But one friend mentioned it to her a few days ago and she\u2019s been mad at me for complaining to everyone she is cheap. But it\u2019s not like everyone doesn\u2019t already know. And she is pretty upfront about it.", "created_utc": 1698158468, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17fef0u/aita_for_complaining_to_my_friends_that_my_gf_is/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I actually disagree with people who are saying YTA for talking to your friends about it - if you can't vent relationship frustrations with your friends, are you even friends? That said, your gf should have every right to spend her money as she sees fit and even if her obsession with not spending money does sound like it skews to being a bit unhealthy, you don't get a say. However, you two are pretty obviously completely incompatible and it seems like it's something you should probably address sooner than later because financial incompatibility is a HUGE problem for a relationship.", "YTA for making your relationship and vacation a \"funny story\" to yak to your friends about. Your friend's an asshole for tattling to your girlfriend about it as well.  You don't have anything of consequence to talk about?  Hone your social skills.\n\nYou clearly have very different ideas about managing money.  And you have resentment about it, even though her decisions in general barely impact you.  Either accept the situation and her as she is, or move on.  You've had plenty of history already to make a decision.", "NTA. You are allowed to vent to your friends, storytell, whatever you call it. You also didn\u2019t embellish or lie. The hawaii thing did happen and LOL, she is cheap af.", "NAH. Your lifestyles are just not compatible. Either you learn to live with it, either you move on.", "YTA. As long as she's ensuring that she's paying what she needs for your joint budget, her income or how she spends it has nothing to do with you.  Jobs come and go, and its definitely not a bad thing she is being frugal/watching her spending.  Fasting is the only thing I worry about, but that is mainly for health reasons.  Ultimately, for you to talk behind her back to friends is extremely unfair.  Don't like it? Leave.", "I think ESH but like...she sounds like she could use some therapy for her money anxiety and the uhhhh clear eating disorder???? I can't tell if you were \"complaining\" or just talking about how cheap she is so if you were ilke \"oh my god she's cheap and that makes her boring\" definitely ESH, if you were just like \"hawaii was great blah blah but can you believe my gf wanted to spend 12 hours on a layover juts to save $200??\" that seems like a normal level of chitchat.", "But she isn't changing. You're going to have to decide whether this is something you can permanently overlook.\n\nTo everyone raging at \"how could you talk about her behind her back\": *women do this all the fucking time and I wouldn't be surprised if tons of men do it to (I personally do not). Good lord, my soon to be ex calls her fucking mother after just about every dispute and apparently her mother ends up defending me to her. Women talk to their friends about all sorts of relationship things. That is always behind the SO's back.*\n\nI don't think mentioning that your girlfriend insisted you camp out instead of getting a nice comfy hotel is the kind of egregious offense the others see it as. Bring on the downvotes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNAH\n\nShe lives life her way. That clashes with you. And you're going to have to make a relationship decision about whether to accept it. Nothing to do with anyone being an asshole.", "NTA \n\nThis isn\u2019t sustainable. The woman skips meals and *does not allow you to relax on a vacation*. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t want to actually engage in the society she\u2019s living in, and she\u2019s happy to force you to go without too. Having to hide the bill, having to cook from a camp stove on a vacation despite having the meals to actually relax. \n\nIt\u2019s not okay. And you told it like it is. So she knows it\u2019s not appropriate behavior.", "NTA - people like your GF annoy me lol. She makes her life hard by being so cheap and because you are her BF it affects you.", "Let me see if I get this right. Your gf is concerned with her finances (to extreme you say) and is not interested in flashy, luxurious places/items if it costs her more than what she is comfortable with. This is her style of living and it isn't something new. \n\nSo why are you surprised and annoyed by it? And more importantly, what are your intentions for your relationship? Because someone being frugal with their money is considered a virtue, not a vice. Someone that is not interested in just buying the newest shiniest thing or staying in the luxurious hotels - that's just the way her character is. So is this something you find a deal breaker?", "NTA. I don\u2019t get the YTA. My dad used to be like your gf. And it used to hit me so hard mentally. Always obsessing over prices despite having no financial struggle. \n\nI have a friend who is like that too. I can\u2019t imagine if my bf was likes this. Going for a meal and then watching him eat out of Tupperware and not enjoy a drink with me or a vacation with me. \n\nBut she is not going to change. So you have to see if you can live like this forever. If you want kids, if she is going to be stringent with them too. For a while I had a bad relationship with money because of my dad. So you have to see if she will subject your kids this too.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re too bad for talking about your GF while drunk. Even the happiest relationships have issues. Talking about your partner is pretty normal and it wasn\u2019t even something your friends didn\u2019t know.\n\nBut I do think your concerns are valid. Camping out in someone\u2019s backyard yard on vacation and starving yourself to save money on food? There\u2019s a difference between frugal and pathologically cheap.\n\nI\u2019d drop $200 on a direct flight to save six hours just because it\u2019s my vacation and with my career, wasting 6 hours hours of PTO on a plane is undervaluing my precious free time.\n\nShe\u2019s making $62.50 an hour assuming no unpaid overtime. Spending an extra 6 hours on a plane to save $200 values her personal time at $33.33/hour. On vacation. And then you miss out on going to restaurants to enjoy the local food because you\u2019re cooking on a camp stove.  Hotel, restaurants, etc. are all expenses that can be easily budgeted for ahead of time. \n\nNot to mention that purposely starving yourself on a regular basis can have health implications.  And it\u2019s likely they will cost more down the line than the savings from not spending ~$5/night on a home cooked meal. \n\nSame with the car. Prices are overinflated now. Spending a bit more on something reliable with lower mileage isn\u2019t a bad decision. It\u2019s a penny wise pound foolish mindset.\n\nMindsets like this tend to get more extreme over time. Your GF is pathologically cheap and there are deeper psychological issues here that need to be addressed. Imagine this mindset with kids and budgeting for their dietary needs.  Is she going to cheap out then too? Does she cheap out on doctors visits and such?\n\nAlso lmao at all the \u201cShe just likes to not consume enough calories every day you evil gossip,\u201d responses.", "Dude, is this how you want to live your life? With someone living so cheaply they\u2019re miserable even on vacation?  She wants to live like this, fine.  Is this how you want to live?\n\nNTA.  You are allowed to complain to your friends.", "NTA for complaining to your friends since it's guy locker room. However, if you're unhappy with her, you might want to re-evaluate your relationship with her.", "NTA - But you need to have a serious talk with her and find out where this monetary insecurity comes from. \n\nThere is frugal, and then there is skipping meals to save money when she has plenty to feed herself. This is concerning. Is this going to be something in the future where you can never get new appliances or remodel a space, because the existing is 'still working'? Or ever have a good vacation because all she can think about is the money being spent?\n\nSeriously, you need to find out where this is coming from. This kind of behavior is already having consequences on your relationship. Money is the number one thing (statistically) that couples argue about. Starting out so far apart on the subject requires a talk at very minimum.", "NTA. You weren't trashing or talking massive shit behind your GFs back like most of this comment section is saying, you were griping about an unfulfilling vacation because your very frugal GF didn't want to spend any extra money at a tropical vacation. Everyone gripes to someone, it's stupid to pretend to otherwise. I don't think your GF did anything wrong but if her frugality is making a damn vacation feel like a chore then you really need to be telling her and not your friends, but I also don't think venting to someone else makes you an asshole.", "NTA - You literally described what your holiday was actually like. \n\nIf she finds it embarrassing then its just a sign she should change.", "She is cheap and YTA because you complained behind her back.  \nIf this is an issue with you (Which i totally understand) you should talk with her, see if it's something that can be changed, and if it isn't, perhaps move on, because she is frugal/cheap and you're not.", "YTA. Why are you still with her if you resent how she is with money so much? She will not change and you seem to be extremely bothered by it.", "Yep, YTA.  Talking about her and having it get back to her is always a A story.  I also think you should move on, or have a serious talk with her.  Her eating behavior sounds troubling to me.", "YTA.  \n\nYou have some valid concerns, particularly about her diet, but everything you've said is couched in how she's \"no fun\".  You're not concerned for her, you're concerned about having a good time.", "YTA a $23,000 car isn't by any means cheap", "ESH. What she does with her money is her choice. However, your gf has some habits that are harmful to her own health and this is an issue you should be discussing more extensively with your gf, not your friends. This is clearly a problem for you, so it needs to be addressed. Speaking ill of her behind her back won\u2019t address it.", "YTA. Would you want your gf talking shit about you behind your back?", "YTA, I've seen many post about partners being too fast and loose with their financials, and yet your girlfriend being frugal and doesn't like to splurge on things rub you the wrong way? It seem as though you want her to be your sugar momma or something and I'm glad she is aware of her financials to not go overboard on anything. She is definitely not being cheap. She's just looking out what's best for her and her future and hopefully that does not include you if you continue to have that mindset about her.", "going to lean YTA here, because you can just breakup with her if you dont like her way of life.\n\ni do think that shes on the extreme end and not making very wise decisions because 6h of vacation time is definitely worth 200 dollars. and its not very smart to skip dinner and tupplewear every meal because you are going to definitely cost yourself more in healthcare later on.\n\nand so i do think its not abnormal to talk to this with your friends. thats what friends are for.", "Her money, her choices. You seem to feel entitled to not only her money but in deciding for her how best to spend it. That makes you an asshole.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s not nice to make your SO the punchline. \n\nYour GF obviously works hard to get where she is and doesn\u2019t value the same things you do. It\u2019s worth asking yourself whether your lifestyles are compatible", "You don't talk at all about her expenses.   Does she have mortgages on the properties she owns?  How much are property taxes?  Maintenance costs?  HOA fees?  Does she have student loans to pay off?", "ESH.  Your GF is cheap to the point of it being unhealthy mentally and physically.   If she is unwilling to seek help for her obsessive-compulsive behaviors, you can't help her.  However, your complaints are also mean-spirited and not helpful.  It is probably best if you break up since your values are so incompatible.", "ESH\n\nShe sounds like she has some financial trauma issues or something but you are also judging her when you already know her and choose to be with her. \n\nThe fact is you need to have a real discussion bc it's obv you aren't happy with her lifestyle and it's not going to change unless she wants it to and sees value in spending a little on experiences and conveniences.", "It sounds like you are incompatible about money management. As someone who isn\u2019t frugal I can understand the frustration but you aren\u2019t going to change her opinion on the matter, nor should you. If you want to do nice things on vacation, book it yourself. Also depending on where you live, 130k isn\u2019t a lot of money. You should both compromise on splitting essential costs and deal with the extra money for you to spend on whatever you want. If you can\u2019t live with the fact that she isn\u2019t spending any of her extra money then it\u2019s time to move on and quit complaining about it to your friends.", "YTA, she likes saving money and having savings, what's wrong w/ that? sounds more like you're jealous she makes more and is able to afford nice things (even if she doesn't WANT them)", "YTA\n\nWhy are you trying to spend your girlfriend's money?", "YTA. It\u2019s her money to spend or save. If you don\u2019t appreciate her, break up and find someone who only spends. You\u2019re a jerk and your friend was right to tell her. She deserves to know her soon to be ex is an AH.\n\nIf this is ragebait, congratulations! I\u2019m enraged!", "Mostly YTA. For the most part it sounds like her frugality only benefits you, represents strong values and character on her part, and I think your repeated references to her being 'cheap' are inappropriate. It's frankly none of your business if you agree or don't agree with her car choice.  \n\nHowever I do see that when it comes to joint planning, you are impacted, and may generally want a lifestyle that is more free with spending. In this way you might be incompatible. It isn't fair to expect her to cover the things you want to do that are more spend-y, you should be covering your own way. But you may decide you want a partner who wants to do those things too. I think insisting on friends camping out on vacation rather than other options is a bit overbearing of her and others shouldn't be restricted because of her own preferences on something like a group trip, but ultimately you are more of TA here because it was shitty of you to complain to others about it.", "$130K in CA where I live is not that much.  Buying a car within your means and not eating out is a smart move, she sounds very smart with her money.  Buying a lambo is an extreme luxury, and not wise for someone making $130K.  I bet she puts money away monthly for retirement and emergency savings for her home\u2026again, she sounds very smart with her finances!", "YTA: How one spends should not be your concern.\nIt is one of the reasons she has money.

If it bothers you that much then break up with her.", "I lost count of how many times he says she\u2019s so cheap although she has gone to the other extreme but I definitely understand her wanting to save. Maybe instead of criticizing her you should learn from her because she is better than many of us, and instead of attacking her you should tell her we are going to set a budget for going out to dinner or a travel budget for vacations and so doesn\u2019t feel she is giving that large amount of money at once.", "You are so jelous od her that IT drips from each sentence. The problem is not that she is cheap (her money, her decisions) you are mad bc she earns more than you and she chooses to save IT rather than overspend IT if IT where your money.", "Laughing with others about habits that could be trauma-related is poor behavior.

But you\u2019ve got no problem living cheaper and admit her fasting has helped you too. The problem is, you didn\u2019t go vent to a close friend about it. You dogged her to a group of people. You talked down about her. So harshly one of those people brought it up to her. They felt comfortable saying something about her being cheap to her face, and you gave them confidence to do so. Im sure there are times where your frustrations are justified, but it\u2019s not ever ok to talk down about your partner to a group of people. Every one needs some one to vent to some times but that isn\u2019t what you did. What you did was talk shit about her to a group of people. That is what makes you TA here.", "YTA.

It sounds like most of what she does to save money would be considered financial responsibility (not buying a more expensive car just because you can afford to), and the only \"proof\" we have that she skips meals to save money is based on your narration which could be completely false.

I\u2019m also in tech but as a C++ gaming developer I only make $75k. I\u2019m thinking of switching now since the gaming industry definitely takes advantage of us. \n\nShe is really cheap and her family isn\u2019t poor by any means, they have multiple rental properties. She has 2 properties herself, one we live in and split expenses and a duplex she rents out. I do get lower than market rent which I appreciate and with a cat it\u2019s hard to find places to begin with. But other than that she is really cheap. She had a 180k mile car that has broken down twice and the mechanic and I have both told her to replace it. But she finally did when it broke on the highway and she got a $14k car and was sad her savings went down. She could buy a lambo in cash at this point and not be in trouble but she is soooo cheap. She saw a $23k car she liked a lot more but went with the cheaper car instead. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t eat dinner often to save money. Intermittent fasting is now a thing but she\u2019s been doing it since college to save money. She has remained trim which is rare for a desk job but she does it purely to save money. She never eats out and will bring a Tupperware to lunch and then fast until breakfast which is always oatmeal and banana. I\u2019ve lost weight living with her but man is it boring. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to take her out but when I do I was to snatch the bill so she doesn\u2019t see it. If she does she would probably faint especially with today\u2019s prices. She never eats out because of the price and it\u2019s hard to get her to even order a drink with a meal because she is so use to never drinking anything but water because she feels like even a pop or juice is too expensive. \n\nA bunch of friends and I were going out of eat and they were talking about vacations and I mentioned a vacation we took to Hawaii. There was the option to direct fly or layovers which was double the time. It was $200 a ticket more for the direct flight but would save us 6h and I convinced her(after lots of back and forth) to take the shorter trip but she was not happy. She also insisted we stay at a Airbnb campsite in someone\u2019s backyard in Hawaii because hotel rooms were expensive. We also still cooked every meal from a camping stove she had. I was a bit tipsy and told this story and people my friend were shocked because who goes to Hawaii and does this? But one friend mentioned it to her a few days ago and she\u2019s been mad at me for complaining to everyone she is cheap. But it\u2019s not like everyone doesn\u2019t already know. And she is pretty upfront about it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Hell I don't even blame someone for venting that they are exasperated at the situation.\n\nIn the end OP has to communicate with their GF about this issue, whether either of them is willing to compromise, and if not whether to go their separate ways.

Dude used to take food from homeless shelters because he couldn't stand the thought of paying for anything. He would get mad at her if she bought groceries. He wore ratty old clothes and would refuse to buy new ones and wouldn't even let her buy a winter coat even though they lived in Canada. All of this was while she was relying on him because she was finishing her master's degree. Maybe OP's gf is not quite at that extreme but it's trending toward the kind of behavior that indicates she is not ok. (not fully relevant but she married him in an Indian not quite arranged marriage but practically arranged marriage deal so none of the issues were evident)", "I am a bit sceptical about the \"she skips meals and does intermittent fasting because of money\" - sound more that the girlfriend is following a specific diet since college time and it also sounds that it is working out for her and that's why she is following it. I wonder if the \"never eats out\" is due to the same reason and so on is the \"cooked over campfire\" as well. \n\nAgain, \"what's the point of working hard when you won't even have a drink out once in a while\" - many people save towards retirement so they don't have to work their whole lives until death. People have different visions for what financial stability is and what goals they have than others. The question is if this is a dealbreaker for her partner and what his vision of their future is? \n\nBut to be fair, the question OP was asking if he was asshole for complaining to his friends about how cheap his GF is. And on that I would say, yes. YTA, OP. If you have issue with her financial behavior - you talk it out with her. It is your relationship - the two of you. Of course people sometimes vent to their friends about their partners but that always risks the partner feeling humiliated and betrayed when your inter-relational dirty laundry is aired in front of others. And you took that risk and the odds weren't in your favor. Your GF found out and unsurprisingly felt humiliated.", "Yeah, a lot of these behaviors are pretty sorting to me. What\u2019s she saving up for?", "Yeah, this level of cheapness borders on paranoia or neuroticism but I didn't want to get into that because for all we know his GF might really have a serious issue that manifests as \"spend as little money as possible\".

Apparently the man has no right to say anything about extra money earned by his partner when the woman partner earns more but when the male partner earns more, he has to pitch in 50/50 and the woman can have control over his extra money.\n\nAnd since when can partners not talk with their friends about stuff going on? There was literally a post where a female partner was calling her husband a dumb person and complaining about him in a message conversation and everyone was excusing that because women talk about this sort of stuff with this friends?", "Skipping meals entirely out of anxiety for spending money is not healthy. OP says she's not eating dinner because she does not want to pay for it... That is pretty extreme.", "Money is a tool - when it controls you to this extent, it's a problem. Skipping meals to save money, refusing to spend it even on necessities (like a car when yours is breaking down), not being able to see a dinner bill without getting upset, making your partner camp on vacation and eat off a camping stove (there is SO MUCH great food in Hawaii!) because you can't bring yourself to spend money - all of this is problematic. She should put a pause on dating until she's talked to a professional about this.", "It\u2019s disrespectful. Just because other people do something doesn\u2019t make it fine. Women shouldn\u2019t talk about their partners behind their backs, either.", "I think you're generally right, but it sounds like gf is taking this a lot further than buying a Honda Civic. There are ways to be smart with your money without taking it so far that you don't enjoy life. Granted, some people enjoy being frugal above all else, but for them it seems the focus is entirely on money, to the detriment of everything else. If you can afford it, the extra airfare and standard hotel room probably makes more sense if it means more sleep/downtime, more vacation time, etc. To me that trip sounds like paying a lot of money to be stressed out and tired.\n\nOP is still TA for what he did and it's quite possible he's exaggerating.

Him complaining to his friends about her isn't a good look on himself either.", "Absolutely not, eating out is some thing that we don\u2019t really do, we save a lot of money by making food at home and taking our own lunch to work.

He wasn't very well liked.", "This obsession with saving money does sound unhealthy there is more to life than a number in your bank account and it genuinely does sound annoying to try enjoy a relationship with someone who isn't putting in an effort to enjoy it with you", "This. She's frugal but buying a $14k car and a trip to Hawaii aren't exactly suffering, and lots of people eat oatmeal and a banana for breakfast.", "Bordering?  It is well in the territory of being cheap.  She is so unwilling to spend money, even on things that she likes more and would make her happier than numbers on an account balance.", "Right. The fasting bit isnt even odd or abnormal. Many adults I know dont eat breakfast. Thats literally the extent of fasting lol. Also many people to eat Keto diets do this. Its not even slightly abnormal or rare tbh. My own doctor does it. Hes been practicing internal medicine for lile 35 years lol", "That\u2019s how I see her eating choices. My bf fasts intermittently as he is prediabetic and it does help his blood sugar and weight. He has a nice car, but works on it himself as he\u2019s a mechanic. I\u2019d describe him as frugal, his truck (he has two vehicles) is a junker to my family, but it runs, he LOVES working on it, and it\u2019s cost effective. Same with his fancy BMW. It works for him and I\u2019m not going to question it. Bills are paid, we exchange good gifts, and manage our money well. Seems like someone id love to speak to about their spending habits honestly. Everyone is different, but she\u2019s made it a lifestyle choice and when a seriously expensive emergency happens, she is going to be prepared financially, which is more than half the battle. \n\nI don\u2019t speak to friends to complain about my partner. I actually rarely tell people we have any disagreements, really only a trusted friend who will give advice and not judge, and I communicate with my partner when I do because I feel he should know. He\u2019s okay with it as it\u2019s always just advice on how to understand my partner differently and they know each other.  This is more \u201cshit talking\u201d than advice and that makes OP the AH. \n\nDid OP pay half of Hawaii? Or did she foot the bill? Saving a little money with a 6 hr extension sucks, but beggars can\u2019t be choosers, clearly OP should be saving money, and bring a book with you or something. It\u2019s not that hard. We took trips when I was a kid. We had to deal with layovers due to money constraints, but I brought things to do or napped in the terminal. Maybe napping isn\u2019t the best for OP, but a dose of the real world would be.", "I missed that part. Yeah\u2026 that is pretty extreme", "I doubt OP's description of this (the meal issue). He described his gf has done this since college (so prior to her super high salary) and that she prepares her own lunch, doesn't eat out at all. This might have a different explanation that he is either oblivious about or not interested to accept as valid reason or simply not sharing to strengthen the \"cheap gf\" narrative. \n\nShe might have some sort of food aversion or diet restriction or even health issue that makes her want to control what exactly she is eating or when she is eating (e.g. not eating too heavy dinner or too late). This might explain the \"cooking at own camping fire\" in Hawaii too. She might have some sort of food disorder or has had it in the past and keeping this routine (since college as described by OP) is her way to control it or some other trauma that shaped this behavior.", "Oh I agree he should leave if he\u2019s unhappy. It may be trauma based though. My grandma was raised by parents who survived a genocide. Frugal is an understatement, but she isn\u2019t necessarily wrong as she was able to be the breadwinner in my moms family with ease and no notice, so it ended up being for the better. Supported 2 kids through college and my grandfathers health issues till he died. She\u2019s 92 and still living her best life tbh. \n\nI think gf needs a partner who communicates with them instead of talking poorly and has empathy. If it\u2019s trauma, people deserve partners who work with them to improve themselves and their overall relationship. If OP is unhappy and unwilling to communicate with his partner, preferring to complain to friends, he needs to leave.", "I think OP is allowed to have an opinion about her finances when her frugality directly affects him.", "It sounds to me like she has a deep issue with money because she's making six figures and still won't give herself permission to buy a nice drink or eat three meals a day. That's not responsible, that's ascetic.", "But we don\u2019t know what her long term plans are.  Is she planning on retiring at 45 and spending several years traveling?   Maybe it\u2019s buckle done now and enjoy later.", "Honestly, I'm not a mental health professional, the hyper focus on saving money described by OP makes this seem a little outside normal penny-pincher/spendthrift dynamic. I'd be curious to know if the GF is this rigid about other things in her life.", "I'm going by what OP says because that's the only information I have. It's absolutely conceivable that she began skipping meals in college to save money. Actually as a former broke college student who ate a lot of Top Ramen, the \"broke college student\" stereotype exists for a reason, and it's totally possible she started this in college because she was *actually* broke to the extent of being food insecure, and never got out of the mindset when she started to make real money.\n\nSkipping meals to save money is not healthy.", "So...it's an extremely unhealthy behavior that she passes off as frugality? Not sure that's like \"better\" or less harmful.", "Of course OP is allowed to have an opinion about anything they want. OP can keep complaining until that GF with a 130k salary decides to find someone else who doesn't whine so much."]}
