How much are you working? Normally I'd say make him cook his own food but that's a a hell of a schedule. In our house if one person was working monster hours the other picked up the slack. If you work a lot less can you just bulk cook it and he can just eat it during the week. He's picky but that's pretty plain Jane cooking", "NTA - but (and this isnt a personal attack at all) this is a good example of why getting married so young is a TERRIBLE idea. People mature differently, and some people just seemingly stop maturing at certain ages (i have close friends who still act 23 but are in their 30s; i love them, but damn i couldn\u2019t live with them).\n\nIt isnt your responsibility to cook for him though.

That being said, I dont think he is TA either. He most likely has an eating disorder and should seek help. Im probably even pickier then he is.

But the real question I have is which of those things does he put the cinnamon on?", "NTA but I think it's important to separate the actual problem from the feelings. The actual problem is not that his diet is so limited-- that's his business. It's that when you cook food you enjoy, he complains. \n\nYou can't control his diet or his food preferences. It's nice that you want to cook for him, but it's not practical because of his diet, and he fine cooking for himself. So let him do that, and let go of your guilt about not cooking for him and your frustration that he won't change. He won't, and maybe can't. \n\nWhat he can 100% control is his reaction. I would tell him flat out that you love him, but you cannot and will not live on his limited diet. You need to be able to cook normal food, and he needs to keep his mouth shut about it. If there are certain smells that bother him, you'll turn on a fan or open a window, but the complaining has to stop. On your side, you will promise not to complain about his limited diet and the inconveniences it causes. You have radically different diets and that's going to be difficult for both of you. The only way to make it work is for you both to just stay out of each others' food choices.", "NTA, but being a picky eater myself, I cook extra things sometimes that I know my husband is missing.  Eg, saut\u00e9ed onions that he can add to his meat.  \n\nI dislike certain smells as well, like yogurt, but he needs to swallow his complaints/figure out how to deal with the worst smells.  \n\nYou must have known about his pickiness before you got married, and it didn\u2019t bother you then\u2026this is just another compromise you two have to figure out.

His only response to you cooking for him if you choose to do so should be \"thank you.\" Do not let him control your food!!! And nowhere in the wedding vows did you promise to cook his food for him.

I only ask because my father had trouble eating vegetables as a young adult after abuse he suffered from his own father. Though it seems like this goes beyond just certain foods. \n\nRegardless NTA. His diet is pretty simple to cook/prepare so if he is picky enough to stick to it then he can cook it himself or start learning to prepare his meals in advance. You shouldn't need to sacrifice your own nutritional goals for his sake. You also can't force someone to eat food and making food you know they are not going touch is pointless. I understand the frustration but it isn't a change you can force on someone. Especially if they are dependent on what is familiar.", "NTA - There is NEVER (generally speaking) anything wrong with wanting something different than your partner or doing things in a different way. The asshole territory comes into play when one of you insists that the other do the thing the way you like. You're human for wanting dietary variety and saying that you're \"stinking up the place\" is just controlling behavior.\n\nYou guys are in your 20s and it sounds like your relationship is going on it's 20s. Those hours he works are unreasonable, but if my partner and I spent that much time apart everyday we'd be utterly glued to each other with the little time together we have.

Going to the gym isn't work.\nSo don't include that in his work time.\nHe could have AFRID or be on the spectrum or a multitude of other things, but that is speculative. Here's what isn't. He's a grown ass man with a problem he is unwilling to address, not unable.\nHe works for himself. He could take the time off. He is choosing not too.\nSo with that being said, yes for sure he could make his own food. But he doesn't leave it there. He has a problem with the way your food smells.\nAgain, his problem. That he could handle. But won't. \nSo I guess the first question is ask you is, do you plan on having children with this person? Have you thought of how that will play put?\nHave you talked to him how that will play put?\nPretty soon you will be making a meal for each person on your house, except yourself, because your food is somehow offensive.\n\nIt's my opinion that he has to prioritize getting his problems solved and not blaming you for them.

It's not rude at all to want to eat something you like. It's just as easy to make food for one as it is to make food for two.", "Funny, but also hard for you.  It is difficult living with limited range eaters.", "Yeah that sounds like ARFID it's generally caused by sensory processing disorder", "Diagnosis has become a lot better in the last 10-15 years, would be my guess. If he was assessed as a child, it'd be worth retesting.", "TBH sounds Autistic to me. \n\n1. neurologically unable to relate to your point of view, needs explanation in a way he WILL understand.\n2. Incapable of compromising because it doesn\u2019t make sense the way its put forth\n3. Doesn\u2019t see what neurotypical see as faults, just as part of what he deals with\n4. Literally can\u2019t adapt the way a neurotypical would.\n5. Does not have the understanding of what is making you uncomfortable and is probably stressing him out making the sensitivities worse and him double down to protect his needs.\n6. absolutely need\u2019s control of routines. \n\n\nAs yourself this, is he picky about fabrics or lighting. \nAsk him if an appliance you can\u2019t hear is loud.", "Ok, not bad.  I understand that making a hot meal\nis a way we show our love and care for another.  I usually work from home while he has a 35 minute commute, so i am the one to start dinner.  \n\nMy husband and I have very different food preferences.  I am vegetarian and eat lots of beans and veggies like cabbage and other cruciferous veggies.  He eats meat and high fiber foods like beans and veggie tear up his stomach. \nSo here\u2019s what we do - some things both of us like (pasta with marinara), that\u2019s an easy dinner we both like.  He is involved in meal planning- so for example he will make a big batch of meatballs and freezes them in small portions and I heat them in a separate pot.  \n\nI also batch cook things he likes and things I like so it\u2019s easy to reheat and prepare - for example I will make chili or bean soup for me and chicken noodle or beef stew for him - I just unfreeze it in portions and it\u2019s easy to pop out and reheat a different meal for each of us.  That way I don\u2019t feel like I am going to all the trouble of making two separate meals all the time.  \n\nMy husband is also funny about not eating food because of how they \u201clook\u201d - he doesn\u2019t like green smoothies but if I throw some blueberries in and it changes the color it\u2019s no problem.  I guess what I am getting at is we found a way that works for us and perhaps you can too.  Get him involved in meal\nplanning and batch cooking may work for you too.  Good luck !", "Thank you so much for your advice. He is stubborn when it comes to going to appointments because he has to leave work but it needs to get sorted out sooner than later. He judges all his food experience solly on looks, not even touch with his finger let alone it put it anywhere near his mouth", "Thank you so much for your opinion. I have definitely talked to him about going to see a doctor or therapist about his food habits but leaving work is makes sound like will never be an option", "Yes I do do that but he constantly complains about the smell of my food. And I feel bad that I won\u2019t make him food because he is so picky as well how it is cooked.", "100% I\u2019ve tried asking him if he wants help but he gets frustrated because I bring it up too much and he would be missing work if he has to go to doctors or therapy appointments.", "Good to know. I will look into that", "He is not picky about volume or textures. Everything is only related to food. He listens to Racecars reving all day and it doesn\u2019t bother him one bit and he will wear any clothes as well.", "Thank you so much I will definitely take your insights and start implementing them", "You can look up ARFID too... sounds like in that wheelhouse (doctor here)", "You also mentioned sensitivity to smell. That\u2019s also a real issue/concern. Please take this random advice from an internet stranger: it makes a HUGE mindset difference to think something is real and medical instead of just a \u201cchoice\u201d. \n\nThe \u201cpicky\u201d label is derogatory towards people who have a real problem. (Not derogatory towards people who are spoiled or who claim food allergies they don\u2019t have). \n\nMy mother still dismisses my son\u2019s sensory issues. My husband asked me why I didn\u2019t consider it picky. I explained my point of view. IF he changed his tolerances by day or circumstance, I could believe it was being picky.\n\n (My son can\u2019t tolerate cheese.) It doesn\u2019t matter if it is sliced, melted, solid, etc. If he tastes cheese he gags and if forced to eat\u2026throws up. It can be a sandwich, pasta, or pizza. As soon as the cheese is incorporated he can\u2019t eat it! \n\nHe also can\u2019t tolerate condiments. No ketchup, mustard, etc. He has detected cheese in dishes at a potluck when the cheese was not immediately disclosed! He could tell it was there. (Dialed to 11.)\n\nYour concerns are valid!! So are your husband\u2019s issues. Focus on trying to work together for a solution. ( if you want examples of how I address this cooking for a family, just ask. I won\u2019t dump it on you otherwise.)", "Of course! \n\nAlso, I bet you his anger is absolutely misdirected at you and that he\u2019s mad at himself. I know before I knew what ARFID was and how to cope, that I would get incredibly angry at the idea of food and how many foods I don\u2019t like, and I\u2019d take it out on my loved ones instead of dealing. Hopefully he will apologize for any grumpiness", "If someone in my house is making food that I don't like the smell of I just go to a different room. You could open a window and turn on a fan though. He shouldn't be preventing you from making food even if he is sensitive to smell.", "It\u2019s not being picky about volume its asking is he can pick up sounds you can\u2019t. Like maybe he hates the microwave because the particular sound it makes is uncomfortable. \n\nThat will narrow down if he needs assessed for ASD or Arfid better.\n\nedit to add: \nI don\u2019t thin your the A here. I think your husband needs assessment and help. And this needs to happen before a bunch of people on the internet convince you he\u2019s abusing you by simply having medical needs. And before you burn yourself out hardcore!", "Thank you! I definitely will", "Thank you so much. I would love to hear about how you make meals in your household. I have asked my husband if he would be willing to see a doctor, dietitian, or a therapist about his food habits but leaving work stresses him out so much that I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever do I just because the amount of time he will take off for appointments", "The word picky isn\u2019t derogatory, it\u2019s descriptive. Also, a person can be picky without changing the foods they won\u2019t eat. \n\nRegardless of whether a picky eater is picky due to medical reasons or not, it is unreasonable to require others to adhere to severely limited diets. In fact, severely limited diets result in nutritional deficiencies. \n\nPicky eaters need to cook for themselves or order food they like.", "I hope so too. I get so nervous being up his food habits over and over again because I know he gets frustrated that people think he\u2019s weird or hard headed but he definitely need help.", "I agree", "How did his family manage his food issues growing up?", "His mom would make the meal for the family and then Cole\u2019s meal. He comments every once in a while about his mom smelling up the house too when she makes something for the family that he won\u2019t eat but I wonder if he got used to the smell.  Now that I make different food than his mother I wonder if that is being up old habits and that is why he making all the comments", "NTA.", "This is a complicated one.\n\nNormally I would say that you are not required to cook for your husband at all, but since he is working ridiculous hours, it is very unrealistic that he cook for himself.  If he's going to continue working these hours, he is going to need support.\n\nAlso, some people are just picky eaters.  There can be a million reasons why this is, trauma related to certain experiences with food, conditions like autism (lots of autistics are undiagnosed) which make people super reliant on routine and super adverse to strange tastes or textures, or all sorts of things.  If you have the full list of foods he eats, then it really isn't that difficult to cook those foods for him.  You don't have to eat what he eats, but I think it's dumb to stop cooking for him just because he has a limited pallet.\n\nThat being said, i think the real problem here is that he's working pretty much all his waking hours, has no time to cook for himself, and no time to essentially have any life at all.  I don't know your financial situation, but it might be time to sit down and have a talk about whether or not this life style is necessary or viable for the both of you.  Maybe it may mean you take on more paid work to let him work fewer hours.  Again, I don't know your situation 100%, but that is my opinion considering the information you have giving.\n\nEDIT:  I really want to add that is a jerk move to try and pressure people to try new foods if they have a limited pallet.  People are sensitive about food.  Pressuring people to put something in their bodies they don't want is an AH move.  All of your comments about \"why doesn't he just try it!\" and \"he's so closed minded about it\" and \"he isn't even getting the nutrients he needs!\" makes you an AH.

So my SO and i eat mostly different things. I would never expect that he is reduced to my limited palette. Even though i can't eat much, food is joy for me and to take this away from someone else is kinda selfish. \n\nOP, i kinda wonder... he is out of the house from 7 to 10, so 15 hours.
