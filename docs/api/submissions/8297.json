How much are you working? Normally I'd say make him cook his own food but that's a a hell of a schedule. In our house if one person was working monster hours the other picked up the slack. If you work a lot less can you just bulk cook it and he can just eat it during the week. He's picky but that's pretty plain Jane cooking", "NTA - but (and this isnt a personal attack at all) this is a good example of why getting married so young is a TERRIBLE idea. People mature differently, and some people just seemingly stop maturing at certain ages (i have close friends who still act 23 but are in their 30s; i love them, but damn i couldn\u2019t live with them).\n\nIt isnt your responsibility to cook for him though. My girlfriend of 5+ years and I rotate, and will generally try and make things the other likes, but also make concessions.

That being said, I dont think he is TA either. He most likely has an eating disorder and should seek help. Im probably even pickier then he is.

But the real question I have is which of those things does he put the cinnamon on?", "NTA but I think it's important to separate the actual problem from the feelings. The actual problem is not that his diet is so limited-- that's his business. It's that when you cook food you enjoy, he complains. \n\nYou can't control his diet or his food preferences. It's nice that you want to cook for him, but it's not practical because of his diet, and he fine cooking for himself. So let him do that, and let go of your guilt about not cooking for him and your frustration that he won't change. He won't, and maybe can't. \n\nWhat he can 100% control is his reaction. I would tell him flat out that you love him, but you cannot and will not live on his limited diet. You need to be able to cook normal food, and he needs to keep his mouth shut about it. If there are certain smells that bother him, you'll turn on a fan or open a window, but the complaining has to stop. On your side, you will promise not to complain about his limited diet and the inconveniences it causes. You have radically different diets and that's going to be difficult for both of you. The only way to make it work is for you both to just stay out of each others' food choices.", "NTA, but being a picky eater myself, I cook extra things sometimes that I know my husband is missing.  Eg, saut\u00e9ed onions that he can add to his meat.  \n\nI dislike certain smells as well, like yogurt, but he needs to swallow his complaints/figure out how to deal with the worst smells.  \n\nYou must have known about his pickiness before you got married, and it didn\u2019t bother you then\u2026this is just another compromise you two have to figure out.

His only response to you cooking for him if you choose to do so should be \"thank you.\" Do not let him control your food!!! And nowhere in the wedding vows did you promise to cook his food for him.

I only ask because my father had trouble eating vegetables as a young adult after abuse he suffered from his own father. Though it seems like this goes beyond just certain foods. \n\nRegardless NTA. His diet is pretty simple to cook/prepare so if he is picky enough to stick to it then he can cook it himself or start learning to prepare his meals in advance. You shouldn't need to sacrifice your own nutritional goals for his sake. You also can't force someone to eat food and making food you know they are not going touch is pointless. I understand the frustration but it isn't a change you can force on someone. Especially if they are dependent on what is familiar.", "NTA - There is NEVER (generally speaking) anything wrong with wanting something different than your partner or doing things in a different way. The asshole territory comes into play when one of you insists that the other do the thing the way you like. You're human for wanting dietary variety and saying that you're \"stinking up the place\" is just controlling behavior.\n\nYou guys are in your 20s and it sounds like your relationship is going on it's 20s. Those hours he works are unreasonable, but if my partner and I spent that much time apart everyday we'd be utterly glued to each other with the little time together we have.

Going to the gym isn't work.\nSo don't include that in his work time.\nHe could have AFRID or be on the spectrum or a multitude of other things, but that is speculative. Here's what isn't. He's a grown ass man with a problem he is unwilling to address, not unable.\nHe works for himself. He could take the time off. He is choosing not too.\nSo with that being said, yes for sure he could make his own food. But he doesn't leave it there. He has a problem with the way your food smells.\nAgain, his problem. That he could handle. But won't. \nSo I guess the first question is ask you is, do you plan on having children with this person? Have you thought of how that will play put?\nHave you talked to him how that will play put?\nPretty soon you will be making a meal for each person on your house, except yourself, because your food is somehow offensive.\n\nIt's my opinion that he has to prioritize getting his problems solved and not blaming you for them.

You'll hopefully move on to bigger and better things. You deserve better and I look forward to you realizing it.\n\n\n\nIdk if you want kids, but if you do don't with this guy. Don't fuck your life up. He won't change.", "Nope. He\u2019s a grown man and you need to respect his boundaries. If you\u2019re worried about vitamins and minerals, get supplements for him.

Learn something new every day.", "my nutritionist suspects that i have 'dialed-up' taste buds, and given that i was diagnosed with SPD earlier this year and have a lot of specific food preferences i'm inclined to agree with her. i've never been called a 'picky eater' out loud but i do border on it (i can't stand most fruits/vegetables or almost all of the most common types of meat, for example)\n\nthat said, OP's husband is still an AH for making his comments the way he does. if the smell of a certain food bothers me, i **politely** ask my family not to cook it with me around or at least to let me know when they do so that i can avoid it. if a food taste or texture bothers me, i eat around it/don't serve myself that specific food/find an alternate meal option. the complaints about \"stinking up the place\" are rude, childish, and assholeish. even if OP's husband has sensory sensitivity, he needs to learn some healthy communication skills instead of whining about it all the time\n\nNTA, OP. i hope you and your husband can talk about this like adults and find a solution/compromise that makes both of you happy, but for now i don't blame you for not wanting to cook for someone who's being an asshole about their food preferences \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "When we got married he told me that he would do anything for me besides quitting his racing career. He learned the skills from his dad, and him and his brother finished their first racecar at the age of 14(husband) and 17(brother). He told his elementary school teachers he was going to be a race car driver when he got older and all his teachers told him that that\u2019s not possible or realistic. And here he is showing them. Racing is EVERYTHING to him and there is no way I can take him away from that. It\u2019s not just a hobby but a care. He is such an amazing racer along with his brother who keep each other in line in the car. He told me that when he dies he hopes it\u2019s in the racecar with his brother. Racing runs in their blood and the only thing those boys strive for b", "Wow", "Thank you so much, you are the sweetest.", "Facts. Thank you for your opinion", "You are correct. His dad thinks of himself as a health and nutritional doctor and his dad has put so much shit in his head and gave him steroids as a kid so my boyfriend does not take any medications because of the steroid that his dad gave him as a kid and the way his dad thinks he I superior when it come to nutrition and helath", "There's a thing called being a \"super taster\" which is what is described above as having overactive taste buds. There's a cheap kit you can buy from Amazon to see if your husband can taste particular chemicals that indicate being a super taster. We did one as a party game to see who could taste what. Some people could only taste 1 chemical whereas I could taste 2 of the 3 and one of my friends could taste all 3.\n\nARFID is something someone else mentioned. It is called Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. It means that for whatever reason your husband cannot eat some foods. I have ARFID from being physically held down and force fed as a child by an abusive babysitter. As in food was shoved violently in my mouth and I was slapped in the face until I chewed and swallowed while being held down by someone significantly bigger than me. Trying to force myself to eat makes me vomit every time.", "Ok his passion for race cars makes the likelihood of autism even bigger\n\nSpecial interest (a derogatory term but commonly used by professionals) is an extremely common trait for autistic folks and boys often have something like trains (hmm race cars)", "He's frustrated with your bringing it up? Well you're frustrated with him making an issue about what you cook. So either he see's a Dr or he learns to hush and deal with your cooking meals you like for YOU.", "Wow that\u2019s a lot. I am really sorry that you had that experience. I really want to get him into a doctor, dietician/nutritionist, and or to a therapist but he does not like to leave work. And I feel like I am constantly pushing his buttons because he gets shit about it from everyone including strangers so I don\u2019t like bringing his food habits up", "Makes sense", "I agree 100%. Yes he gets frustrated because everyone that sees him eat wether it is a family member, friend, or Stanger something is always said when he has just meat on his plate", "Yeah people are weirdly obsessed with other people's abilities to eat food. I had a \"friend\" who constantly said I had 5 year old taste buds because I couldn't eat say mushrooms. Textures of food is a huge issue for me and mushrooms set that off bad. It's really annoying. Even in this sub people routinely shit on picky eaters, never mind that some of us have a reason to be picky.", "Interesting!", "True true", "It has been pointed out already but just throwing my fellow ADHD cents here: for the longest time I was labeled as a \u201epicky eater\u201d. It was only in my  mid 20s when I got diagnosed and started really looking into the struggles I\u2019ve always been going through, that I realized my \u201epicky eating\u201d was pretty much sensory issues in a trenchcoat.\n\nI don\u2019t like trying new foods unless the ingredients are on a \u201epre-approved list\u201d in my head. I can\u2019t have fat on my meat because it causes me to physically gag, and it\u2019s a completely involuntary reaction. I can\u2019t have rare meats, processed tomatoes (sauces, tomato soup), most condiments, dressings and heavily seasoned meals, the list does not end here. I don\u2019t have any allergies or any other medical issues. It\u2019s my body that will actively refuse to have those things, and my brain will force the illusion of already being full to avoid eating any more. I mean, one of my comfort foods is literally boiled chicken breast with brown rice and spinach - it is NO ONE\u2019s comfort food, dangit.\n\nOn the other hand there\u2019s my partner who, like you, will eat just about anything. He grew up in a family where letting things go to waste is a huge no no. He\u2019s also the cook in our household, but he\u2019s making things work for both of us and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful.\n\nNAH in my opinion, as the cause of a similar (although probably not as severe) situation I wholeheartedly appreciate how frustrating this is for you. But I don\u2019t believe your husband is trying to be an asshole, he may be struggling the same way I do without understanding the root of his problem. Both of you should definitely look into it.", "NTA\n\nWhy are you married to him? \n\nAlso if he doesn't cook, he doesn't get to complain about the smell. Thems the rules. If he cooks, he controls the smell. If he refuses to cook, then he has to deal with -gasp- the smell of *food*.\n\nHow horrifying.", "NTA. Your choices are to stop cooking for him, or cook a separate meal for him and cook whatever you want for yourself. However, why even talk about cooking with him? If your agreement about household chores includes you making his meals, change the agreement if you don't want to cook for him. You can't change him. Only being willing to cook for him if he will try new foods is controlling and an attempt to change him. This is who he is. If you want to be happily married, just accept that about him and stop trying to change it. If you'd prefer to be married to someone who ate a broader variety of food, get divorced and go marry that person. HOnestly, being so controlling around someone's diet is not the hill you want to die on if you plan to be happily married for a long time. Embracing his weird food habits and ignoring his comments about cooking smells will go a long way to make your marriage more satisfying than getting in a snit because he doesn't like potatoes. Seriously.", "Thank you for sharing your experiences", "Thank you so much for your insight and sharing your experiences. I will definitely have to look into it with him", "He does cook quite a bit of the time but he will ONLY make what he will eat. He will not make food for me unless I am eating what he is eating", "I can live with out the comments though. It will always be a constant reminder", "I\u2019m sorry but WHO THE FUCK DOESNT LIKE POTATOES?!?!?!", "This guy does not have time to be married. When do you spend time together? You're not his maid or cook.", "We sleep next to each other and I stop at the shop just to say hi before I go home and do homework. or I will even do my homework at the shop occasionally but it\u2019s hard to do it their because of the noise.", "Did you see where he goes to the gym gor an hour, works 8 to 5, and then works on racecars from 5 to 10 *every day*?", "i feel ya can\u2019t stand picky eaters. I do find it rather hard to believe there\u2019s not at least a dishes or two you both agree on truthfully.", "You\u2019re most welcome! Just in case any of this works for you guys, here\u2019s some things we do:\n\n1. If your husband hates potatoes, rice, veggies, make a small portion of them that will be a side just for you.\n2. Wherever possible, my partner serves me a virgin version of the dinner and then goes all out on the rest with his spices, condiments and extra ingredients. It also applies when one dish can be a base for another dish, for example when he wants tomato soup, he makes chicken soup first (which I adore) and then tomatoes it up.\n3. Sometimes we eat different meals altogether, especially when there\u2019s little time to be creative - for example I\u2019ll pull out some dumplings from the freezer and he\u2019ll upgrade some yesterday\u2019s leftovers for himself. We always have our freezer stocked up with things I literally picked myself in the store, so they\u2019re a safe bet.\n4. We also go family style on our meals, he\u2019ll take the bits I don\u2019t want and give me some of the ones I like in exchange. This one might depend on the level of your husband\u2019s tolerance towards an ingredient though (I can\u2019t have the taste of processed tomatoes at all, but I don\u2019t mind the flavour of fatty meat in my meal - just the texture. So I\u2019m okay with it being an ingredient as long as I can take it out).\n\nI\u2019m not claiming any of those is ideal, but they\u2019re compromises we\u2019re comfortable doing on a daily basis, so there is some merit to them!", "Ooooof", "NTA, but could you maybe ask his mom for some of her recipes that she knows he likes? Tell him you need to know 100% what to cook for him or you're done cooking. It shouldn't be up to you to figure it out.", "i have severe arid (avoid restrictive food intake disorder) and that\u2019s the exact thing i\u2019d do, it\u2019s a pretty common eating disorder that varies of severity would recommend getting checked for that", "So is his lack of gratitude and implied criticism of your cooking the actual problem? Rather that he doesn't like specific food items? Because what you have said here is more serious than that he doesn't like potatoes. Use a neutral tone and expression while you tell him something like \"I love you and do my best to make a nice meal for you, but you frequently criticise it and make negative comments about the food I make for you. Cooking for you is part of how I show my love for you and when you criticise me it makes me feel bad. I'm not prepared to be criticised constantly so please either be more appreciative or go ahead and prepare your own meals.\"", "I will definitely do that", "Thank you. Will do", "You thinking that a full grown adult should work doesn't necessarily mean she does. We don't make an assumption just because it seems unreasonable for her not to work.", "Thank you for writing that out. I will definitely be using what you said", "Ok then he has to make concessions somewhere. If not in the racing aspect of his life, then others. He has to be willing to eat more things, or eat things that are reheated by microwave, or you come up with some other alternative better suited to your lifestyles. It's his issue, and while you can be involved in finding solutions and helping him, the onus is not on you to fix it", "Does it have to be FIVE HOURS EVERY DAY though?! That's absolute obsession", "One of my kids says he hates every food and just eats what we put in front of him to get it over with, meaning he'll eat just about anything. He's autistic. Could this be related to ARFID? He says he doesn't like the feeling of eating.", "I have ARFID and I was thinking that too. OP doesn't have to cater to his \"pickiness\" but he doesn't have to complain about the smell of their cooking either.", "Thank you", "He has to get the work done sometime and there is always so much of it too", "why are you so insistent on needing a detailed itinerary of OP's day for OP to have a valid complaint?", "That's a tough one. Certainly possible that something like ARFID may be at play. Usually we consider past issues with food in the history of the patient such as severe food poisoning, vomiting, or some traumatic experience etc. Most likely in this case it can be attributed to normal sensory issues seen in ASD. An occupational therapy consult for sensory evaluation can be helpful"]}
