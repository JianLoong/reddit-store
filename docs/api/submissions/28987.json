You are a mother now, your main job is to protect your child.  That includes from your own family if need be.  If you think there is a way to include them healthily then great.  But you need to decide your boundaries now (you are also allowed to change them as needed and as the situation changes) and be clear to your family about how this relationship will proceed moving forward.  Grandparents do NOT need bonding time with an infant.  That is for the parents and primary caregivers.  That's you and partner if you have one, and baby's dad if he is on the picture.  Grandparents build relationships over time and the first few months is not about them in the slightest.

It has nothing to do with the kids at all - it's all about control.", "I think a mother that keeps pushing when told no multiple times is absolutely a bad thing. I think calling anyone, let alone a FRESHLY POSTPARTUM WOMAN in the most vulnerable position she\u2019ll likely ever be in to verbally abuse her so badly that she had to extend a hospital stay is a bad thing. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you feel guilty for cutting off your mother, however that\u2019s your problem and it doesn\u2019t mean that everyone that ends relationships with family members will feel the same. It\u2019s unkind of you to project your guilt and unhappiness onto others rather than just dealing with it.", "My sister was living abroad, when her daughter was born so I met her very late, in the age of 2 or 3, I don't remember it exactly now.   \nWe had a great bond, despite the distance, and later, when sister and niece came back, I \"spoiled\" her wild and we still have a great relationship - now she's a beautiful, smart young woman and I love to spend time with her.", "I didn't physically meet my grandsons until they were 5 months old and have incredible bond with them     not that I didn't want to but we live in different states and travel during the time of year they were born is difficult", "Correction, they do bond. But only with mom. In the womb, the fetus hears its mother's heartbeat and recognises her smell. Once it's born, a baby will turn towards the familiar sound, smell and warmth that it recognises. So, more than a potato, but not much emotion other than hunger, safety and warmth.", "Sounds like the Handmaid's Tale.", "I dont feel guilty. I know I did the right thing. Doesn't mean not having family made me happy. We also are only getting one side of the story. She seems petty and resentful. People who hold grudges are never the happiest people in the world. It will be funny when things come full circle and her child treats her just as bad as she treats her mother.", "I know, that's why I qualified it with \"not in the way that these people seem to think so\" :)  grandma isn't missing out by not \"bonding\" immediately, that time is absolutely meant for mom & dad though!", "They bond with their caregivers. Might be mom, might be dad, might be mom #2, might be adoptive parents, etc."]}
