You are a mother now, your main job is to protect your child.  That includes from your own family if need be.  If you think there is a way to include them healthily then great.  But you need to decide your boundaries now (you are also allowed to change them as needed and as the situation changes) and be clear to your family about how this relationship will proceed moving forward.  Grandparents do NOT need bonding time with an infant.  That is for the parents and primary caregivers.  That's you and partner if you have one, and baby's dad if he is on the picture.  Grandparents build relationships over time and the first few months is not about them in the slightest.
