So, I leave for work at 4:10am and my boyfriend leaves at 4:40am. Last night he had to get something out of my car, so I gave him my keys. I didn't realize that I hadn't seen them since that time until I was leaving this morning at 4:10, maybe 4:11. So I look for a few minutes and they are literally nowhere. We just moved into this house recently so there really are not many places to look, we don't even have a couch or dining set yet. I wake him up around 4:15 (which is the time he's usually waking up or awake by anyway) to help me look. We look for 10 minutes and I am really running late at this point. He starts blaming me several times, saying maybe I moved them after he used them because he has never lost them before. Saying they must have been on the kitchen counter and I must have moved them. I tell him, I know I didn't see them at all after you had them. Finally about 25 minutes after looking, he says maybe they're in my work truck, that's the only place we haven't looked. And there they were, right on his front seat. I was already crying and freaking out for about 15 minutes by then so I went inside to cool down for a minute before leaving. He apologized saying, I'm sorry I lost your keys. I said that's really not the problem, it's that you blamed me and said that I moved them, about 5 times. He then said I take back my apology. Maybe you should have started looking for your keys before 5 minutes after you are supposed to leave. Which by the way wasn't even true, he was sleeping and I chose to look for 5 minutes before waking him. I left it alone though and went to another room until he left. Like wtf, lose my keys then blame me? But then 10 minutes after he left, I'm thinking should I have accepted that apology? Should I have just said like \"it's okay\" and forget about him being an ass and blaming me?

He blamed you for moving your keys and that meant you were searching places where you would put your keys instead of places where both of you could have put your keys. If you were searching all the places where either of you could have put the keys, you would have found them in his truck earlier.\n\nAdditionally, you told him the last time you saw your keys was in his hands.

He refused to help you search where he might have put it and so delayed you further.\n\nHe's the AH for losing your keys, denying he lost your keys, pretend apologising (the type of apology where it's meant to calm you down) and him getting snippy when you didn't react the way he was trying to manipulate you into.", "Blaming each other when shit hits the fan and remaining petty about it after it is resolved is I think something you migt be choosing together.

I would bring this up again when emotions aren\u2019t high and really articulate how this gaslighting behavior hurt your feelings and how he should really own up to his mistake as well as to the fact that he hurt you by blaming you.", "NTA. I normally return anything I borrowed directly to the person  along with a few words of thanks.", "What happened here is so common and you both dealt with it poorly. People simply forget where they put things sometimes - it\u2019s human! In the early morning hours your mind is foggy and you can\u2019t remember things or sometimes you simply save memories incorrectly. Honestly, happens to the best of us. Eventually he realized that it was him and he apologized. This situation could be reverse, next time it\u2019s you who doesn\u2018t remember - it\u2019s always embarrassing. After he apologized imo you should have just accepted it and not assume or suggest that he \u201elied\u201c to you or tried to gaslight you or any bad intent. Tell me one thing: Do you really think that he \u201elied\u201c to you knowingly or accused you DESPITE knowing he was wrong? I find it very unlikely. Imagine next time you are sorry and someone claims you did what you did with bad intent, would you feel good? Unless he has a history of actually gaslighting you I see it as a bad memory issue that doesn\u2019t need a counter-accusation. \n\nThat said, the way he handled your counter-accusation was shitty, to put it nicely, actually, he sounds like a jerk.\n\nThe way you communicate with each other is unhealthy and this misunderstanding spiraled into something unnecessarily ugly, blaming back and forth and the unwillingness to let go on both sides because of such a trivial everyday incident. Is it worth it really? You gotta ask yourself this, both of you. Sit down like adults minus all the blame. you accusing each other back and forth when the truth is this occurrence was a normal human mistake with no bad intent. Whoever says they never forget anything and they can remember things at all times can\u2019t be serious. Let it go. ESH", "So agree with this point!\n\nIn a long term relationship, both of you will screw up many, many times. Both parties need to take responsibility for their own mistakes to help reduce future mistakes. And both need to apologize when they make those mistakes. Life is hard enough without fighting each other over the little things.\n\nOP, in this particular example your guy isn't taking responsibility. Only you know if this is a one-off or if he's always like this. If this is his pattern, you may be in for a difficult time here.\n\nNta", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

EVERYTHING was my fault.  You can do better, even if you aren't dating anyone.", "Finally, one reasonable response.", "Does he often blame you when trying to solve a problem? Even if this was a one off, this may be an indicator for how he reacts when trouble arises. This time, sure he was tired, but what about when you get a flat tire? A bill gets missed? How does/will he react when life happens?  Proceed with caution NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. But your man blows the big one.", ">He then said I take back my apology. Maybe you should have started looking for your keys before 5 minutes after you are supposed to leave.\n\nLet's not forget deflecting once he was called on his behavior. Most people don't start looking for something until they know it is missing. It's not unreasonable to not realize that your keys are missing until you're ready to leave the house.", "NAH getting woken up to look for something can cause some attitude. He saw he was wrong and apologized. That\u2019s half of a relationship, f-ing up and apologizing. The other half is accepting their apologies. When you grant him grace for all the small mistakes, he will grow a trust and safety in you. It\u2019s a big deal to be with someone who allows you to be human and loves you no less for it. Not to mention, when grace has a foothold in the relationship, you are also free to be human. It\u2019s all done now so just move forward and check the truck first next time.", "NTA. This is pretty concerning behavior, he's doubling down on being a jerk over something relatively minor. What about when something actually important happens and he still like this? Is this really the battle you want to fight for the entire rest of your life? Do you really see you spending the rest of your days with this person?", "NTA. His answer to being asked to take responsibility for incorrectly blaming you was to incorrectly blame you for an additional thing. That's an escalation in the deflection game he's playing. \ud83d\udea9", "Nta but \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9about him", "NTA.  But ask yourself how often these types of interactions occur.  If this is a daily or weekly event, get some communication therapy.", "NTA. People misplace stuff, it happens. You don't really emotionally need/want the apology for him losing your keys, but you need/want the apology for his turning the blame on you.", "OMG I'm going YTA. He apologized and you couldn't accept that and move on. You wanted to create extra drama by crying and pointing out his apology wasn't good enough because it wasn't worded how you want. Maybe if he borrows your things make sure you get them back immediately? I always ask for whatever someone uses right back for this reason.", "Gaslighting, really? So you\u2019re suggesting that he knew all along that the keys were in the truck? Because otherwise, this has nothing to do with gaslighting.", "NTA. But your man blows the big one."]}
