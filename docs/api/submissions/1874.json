So, I leave for work at 4:10am and my boyfriend leaves at 4:40am. Last night he had to get something out of my car, so I gave him my keys. I didn't realize that I hadn't seen them since that time until I was leaving this morning at 4:10, maybe 4:11. So I look for a few minutes and they are literally nowhere. We just moved into this house recently so there really are not many places to look, we don't even have a couch or dining set yet. I wake him up around 4:15 (which is the time he's usually waking up or awake by anyway) to help me look. We look for 10 minutes and I am really running late at this point. He starts blaming me several times, saying maybe I moved them after he used them because he has never lost them before. Saying they must have been on the kitchen counter and I must have moved them. I tell him, I know I didn't see them at all after you had them. Finally about 25 minutes after looking, he says maybe they're in my work truck, that's the only place we haven't looked. And there they were, right on his front seat. I was already crying and freaking out for about 15 minutes by then so I went inside to cool down for a minute before leaving. He apologized saying, I'm sorry I lost your keys. I said that's really not the problem, it's that you blamed me and said that I moved them, about 5 times. He then said I take back my apology. Maybe you should have started looking for your keys before 5 minutes after you are supposed to leave. Which by the way wasn't even true, he was sleeping and I chose to look for 5 minutes before waking him. I left it alone though and went to another room until he left. Like wtf, lose my keys then blame me? But then 10 minutes after he left, I'm thinking should I have accepted that apology? Should I have just said like \"it's okay\" and forget about him being an ass and blaming me?

He blamed you for moving your keys and that meant you were searching places where you would put your keys instead of places where both of you could have put your keys. If you were searching all the places where either of you could have put the keys, you would have found them in his truck earlier.\n\nAdditionally, you told him the last time you saw your keys was in his hands. If I was searching for something and someone else had it last time I saw it, I'd be asking them where they might put something like that. He refused to help you search where he might have put it and so delayed you further.\n\nHe's the AH for losing your keys, denying he lost your keys, pretend apologising (the type of apology where it's meant to calm you down) and him getting snippy when you didn't react the way he was trying to manipulate you into.", "Blaming each other when shit hits the fan and remaining petty about it after it is resolved is I think something you migt be choosing together. Wouldn't be my preferred strategy for a relationship, but the problem with picking sides in situations like this is that you are a team, so you both win, or you both lose.\n\nI mean, maybe you were super reasonable and he just wasn't.

I would bring this up again when emotions aren\u2019t high and really articulate how this gaslighting behavior hurt your feelings and how he should really own up to his mistake as well as to the fact that he hurt you by blaming you.", "NTA.

People simply forget where they put things sometimes - it\u2019s human! In the early morning hours your mind is foggy and you can\u2019t remember things or sometimes you simply save memories incorrectly. Eventually he realized that it was him and he apologized. This situation could be reverse, next time it\u2019s you who doesn\u2018t remember. After he apologized imo you should have just accepted it and not assume or suggest that he \u201elied\u201c to you or tried to gaslight you or any bad intent. The way he handled it was shitty, to put it nicely, actually, he sounds like a jerk to say the least.\n\nThe way you communicate with each other is unhealthy and this misunderstanding spiraled into something unnecessarily ugly, blaming back and forth and the unwillingness to let go because of such a trivial everyday incident.\n\nEdit: I see everyone here seems to have excellent  memories at all times \ud83d\ude0f", "So agree with this point!\n\nIn a long term relationship, both of you will screw up many, many times. Both parties need to take responsibility for their own mistakes to help reduce future mistakes. And both need to apologize when they make those mistakes. Life is hard enough without fighting each other over the little things.\n\nOP, in this particular example your guy isn't taking responsibility.
