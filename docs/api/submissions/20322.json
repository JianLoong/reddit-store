Jacob always tells me how my boyfriend is \u201csooo hot\u201d and how he wishes he had a boyfriend as hot as mine. I don\u2019t really pay too much mind to Jacob\u2019s comments because that\u2019s just his personality, he\u2019s outgoing and just says what\u2019s on his mind. My boyfriend has expressed to me that Jacob\u2019s comments make him a lil uncomfortable because he\u2019s not gay and Jacob has been openly flirty with him. \n\nToday we got a new shipment of clothes so I was busy placing the tags on them and Jacob was just chilling at the cash registers. My phone was placed on the counter next to Jacob. As I\u2019m placing tags , the store phone starts ringing so I pick it up. As I\u2019m speaking to the customer, my personal phone also starts ringing (my boyfriend was facetiming me). I look down at my phone and as I was about to reject the facetime Jacob gives a me cheeky look and grabs my phone like he\u2019s about to answer it. I yelled \u201cJacob no, don\u2019t answer it.\u201d He starts jokingly running around the \ncounter, me chasing him. He eventually answered it anyway and was like \u201cheyyy baby\u201d \n\nI quickly snatched my phone out of Jacob\u2019s hand and told my boyfriend I\u2019d call him back in a few minutes and I hung up the facetime. Keep in mind I was still on the phone with the customer while this commotion was going on. I apologized to the customer, helped her out and hung up the call. I look at Jacob (he was laughing about this) and I said \u201cdon\u2019t do that again. Especially when I\u2019m on the phone with a customer. That looked so unprofessional over the phone\u201d. \n\nJacob said \u201comg!!! Just lighten up! I just wanted to talk to your boyfriend. I look good today I just wanted him to see me heheh!!\u201d. I said \u201cjust don\u2019t touch my phone, I don\u2019t answer your phone without your permission. Also my boyfriend isn\u2019t gay and you flirting with him like that makes him uncomfortable\u201d. I didn\u2019t say anything else and just went to the backroom of the store. Since that happened this morning there\u2019s been some awkward tension in the store.\n\nAITA for saying what I said?", "created_utc": 1687447454, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14g6g0z/aita_for_telling_my_manager_not_to_touch_my_phone/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Jacob is sexually harassing you and your BF.  You should report him to the GM or owner.", "NTA\n\nHis comments sound more like sexual harassment to me, even if theyre through the gf and not the person themselves. If he doesnt stop i would file a formal complaint to your boss.\n\nJust because youre openly gay doesnt give you the right to flirt with your coworkers partners, not to speak taking their phone without their permission to talk to said partner.", "NTA. Unprofessional of Jacob to do this as a manager and just as a human being. He's 28, not 8. Also he does need to cut it out with the flirtiness. That is going into sexual harassment territory which I'm sure his boss doesn't want to have to deal with.\n\nI would report him if he continues to be inappropriate to you or your boyfriend.", "NTA, that was really childish and inappropriate, and honestly you should probably escalate the issue above Jacob and get it on record if you can, because he does have the ability to retaliate against you. \n\nThis is a workplace, not high school.", "Your manager is entirely unprofessional and his behaviour is unacceptable. Exactly as it would be if he was behaving this way to someone of the opposite gender. He does not get a pass to behave this way because he is gay. His flirting makes your partner uncomfortable.

He crossed the line.", "NTA. I'm guessing since it's a small boutique there's no HR, or I'd suggest you bring his behavior up with them. \n\nWhen a straight man aggresively flirts with a woman he knows to be gay, everyone agrees that it's terrible and he needs to stop.

Him being gay is relative to the context of what's going on as you told your story but the root issue is that it's unprofessional. \n\nYou can very clearly dictate to your coworkers what is appropriate, and what is not. I have levels of friendship with coworkers that dictate that stuff. But at the end of the day it's my right what I share and how open I am with them regarding non-work related things. \n\nYou laid down the line, you should talk to your manager about it, and have your BF prepped to talk to the manager as well if it needs backup evidence. I honestly think that if you more firmly establish that boundary with Jacob, he would respect it. But I have faith in people, I think setting the boundary and making sure you also communicate to your boss that the boundary is set will help you move forward.", "NTA\n\nGay man here. The whole idea behind gay guys flirting with straight guys as a joke is that it's only funny if the straight guys are in on the joke. My straight guy friends and I have play flirted before just to be funny at a party or some situation like that. Whether Jacob is joking or not, he's still being an asshole, and what he is doing is sexual harassment. Imagine if he were a straight man doing this to a woman. Your boyfriend is uncomfortable, and Jacob is violating your boundaries. That should be the end of the story.", "NTA. It's completely appropriate to tell someone their behavior makes you uncomfortable. Boundaries are important for everyone. Jacob needs to respect them regardless of whether or not he wants to or agrees he should have to.", "NTA. \n\nExactly, sexuality has nothing to do with this.\n\nOP, imagine you went to visit your boyfriend at work and his manager kept hitting on you.\n\nThis qualifies as sexual harassment as well as inappropriately taking an employees property.\n\nIf there is someone above him that this can be reported to do so immediately. Trust me, he will abuse his position and make it out as if *you* are the problem.\n\nIf the company is small enough that he is the last in line to report to, start looking for a new job but make sure to keep a record of every single inappropriate thing he has done. If he retaliates and you lose your job before you find a new one make sure you can receive unemployment or even file suit if you need to.", "Me and Jacob are relatively close. We talk about personal things with eachother (family, friend drama, boys etc) but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s close to the point that I could answer his phone. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s playful like that, more like good friends but only at work because we don\u2019t mingle outside of work", "I should have prefaced though, YNTA for wanting privacy on your phone, regardless of the situation. Was just trying to see if maybe that was the dynamic you guys have and he took it too far so he just needs to reign it in.\n\nBut I don\u2019t really let anyone on my phone besides my niece and nephew personally. \n\nHis behavior towards your boyfriend is unprofessional as is his taking of your phone. You did nothing wrong in trying to set boundaries he needs to learn to respect them even if he means his behaviors in good fun."]}
