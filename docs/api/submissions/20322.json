Jacob always tells me how my boyfriend is \u201csooo hot\u201d and how he wishes he had a boyfriend as hot as mine.

My phone was placed on the counter next to Jacob. As I\u2019m placing tags , the store phone starts ringing so I pick it up. As I\u2019m speaking to the customer, my personal phone also starts ringing (my boyfriend was facetiming me). I look down at my phone and as I was about to reject the facetime Jacob gives a me cheeky look and grabs my phone like he\u2019s about to answer it. I yelled \u201cJacob no, don\u2019t answer it.\u201d He starts jokingly running around the \ncounter, me chasing him. He eventually answered it anyway and was like \u201cheyyy baby\u201d \n\nI quickly snatched my phone out of Jacob\u2019s hand and told my boyfriend I\u2019d call him back in a few minutes and I hung up the facetime. Keep in mind I was still on the phone with the customer while this commotion was going on. I apologized to the customer, helped her out and hung up the call. I look at Jacob (he was laughing about this) and I said \u201cdon\u2019t do that again. Especially when I\u2019m on the phone with a customer.

Also my boyfriend isn\u2019t gay and you flirting with him like that makes him uncomfortable\u201d. I didn\u2019t say anything else and just went to the backroom of the store.
