You're pregnant girl, hide your stash!  \ud83e\udd17\n\nNTA", "NTA, and this is kind of funny to me, because I almost posted about this exact issue a month ago.\n\nI'm a wife and mom to two little boys. The kids are growing, and therefore always hungry, my husband is bigger and more active than me, so they all eat a lot. I, on the other hand, have struggled with eating disorders, and am still careful about what I eat. I do treat myself, but when I do, I plan for it and I make it count, as opposed to grabbing whatever food I come across when I'm feeling snackish.\n\nAs you can imagine, most of the snacks get eaten before I can get to them. When I complained to my husband that all the jalapeno chips were gone, he said the exact same thing as yours: \"The bag had been open for a week!\" It had been 3 days at most.\n\nSo, last month, I got angry. And I didn't have the excuse of being pregnant. I didn't handle it great, but the next day we talked about it calmly. I explained that the situation was causing me food anxiety, in that I was feeling like I needed to either never have the snacks I'd been looking forward to, or eat them when I wasn't actually hungry, which is really not good for me. \n\nLuckily, over the years, my husband has learned the depths of my eating disorder (believe me, it took a long time, he really didn't get it at first). He's since gotten into the habit of getting me my own snacks in addition to the ones for him and the kids, and I can eat them as slowly as I want.\n\nSo, I don't think you necessarily need to hide food, just have food that is clearly marked YOURS. And if you explain it to him calmly, he shouldn't get upset about it. And if he does get upset, well... then he'd be kind of a jerk.\n\nFYI, my husband isn't diagnosed with ADHD, but he also leaves stuff lying around everywhere!", "NTA.  He sounds very selfish.  Buy snacks for yourself and hide it.  Have him start doing grocery shopping as well so that he has a stake in making sure the household has food for everyone.  Hold him accountable.", "NTA.

If he gets his own muffins, then he can share your *shared* things.", "NTA.  I\u2019m not buying his ADHD as an excuse.  Label/clearly tell him what you want to be yours.  Otherwise, I would consider having a locked snack cabinet or something only you can access if it\u2019s this bad.  It would be ridiculous to have to hide snacks\u2026he needs help.", "NTA. He's a grown man, and if he can't control himself, then he needs to do his own shopping. You have enough on your plate, but even if you didn't, he's acting ridiculous.", "NTA.  I have adhd and binge snacking doesn\u2019t really seem like an impulse control thing but more like being not fully aware/engaged and doing other things while getting the food.   \n\nI don\u2019t think you should have to hide things though as he is a grown \ud83c\udf51man and you are 7 months pregnant.   \n\nThe best I would do is to put the stuff meant for you in a separate container labeled for you.  Or something marking the half I guess if he needs a physical reminder. \n\nThe other thing I would suggest is he should pre-portion things himself when he first gets it out and be more aware as he is doing it.  That means he does have to be physically present and doing it mindfully.  \n\nIt\u2019s how I avoid the constant question of did I take my meds? I make myself more present and now I take a photo of my meds in my hands so I have the time stamp too of when I took it and that forced awareness means I\u2019m not questioning it later. \n\nAlso the same for my teenage son who can down a whole lot of candy and not realize while watching tv. So I tell him to get a set amount up front and then it works much better.  He is just fine and doesn\u2019t have a self control issue, he just ate mindlessly.", "A few years back I started having difficulty avoiding compulsively eating certain types of fancy snacks and my partner would eat them slower and then leave them in the living room.\n\nI still got them to hide theirs in a cupboard or *I* would hide them in a cupboard so that I would forget about them or at least have a barrier to eating them.

Except that\u2019s not the case, because he actually doesn\u2019t care if he is taking what\u2019s yours, he probably could control it if he wanted to, and he just wants to have everything go he wants for himself.

Your husband is right that if the Apple Fritters had been sitting then they needed to be eaten. Baked goods don\u2019t last a long time. Most I\u2019ve seen only last 1 week or 1.5 weeks tops. If you are concerned about finish one thing before starting another, then what I might recommend is do two shopping trips during the week.

If you bought them, but then didn\u2019t choose to eat one for weeks on end, then how is that his problem?", "It's nuts that she expects to eat half of the food she made?", "And there so why OP didn't bring up her weight.  She does not need people telling her how to manage her health.\n\nShe is pregnant and under a doctor's care.   She doesn't need AITA redditors judging her, shaming her, giving her medical advice, or weight loss tip, or even making it a factor in this situation.  It is offensive. \n\nIt's also offensive and shitty of you to talk about portions, judge a pregnant woman's weight, and then suggest she eat her truffles faster if she doesn't want to share.", "It is nuts that she is counts how much each person eats...  What next? Adjusting portions based on person's weight? Because guess what, if he is bigger he needs more food... What happens if one tamales falls on the floor? How they determine \"whose\" was it?", "He can eat any other food if he needs more food.  It doesn't have to be her share of whatever the fuck he wants to take.", "Any other alotted food.\n\nI dunno, I just never had a problem sharing like this. Even when pregnant", "NTA. I have ADHD and I do the same kind of spaced out snacking where I'm not even aware I'm doing it, but if that was resulting in me eating all of a shared snack I would WANT to find ways to mitigate it. Putting away half of a shared food so I didn't mindlessly eat it would be HELPFUL because I wouldn't have to keep track of what percentage I'd eaten. \n\nYour husband is NTA for not realizing he was eating more than his share because of a legitimate mental condition, but he absolutely is an asshole for not even trying to find a solution after repeatedly being told you aren't ok with it and even more of an asshole for being mad when you try to problem solve it yourself because it's his responsibility to fix.", "ADHS isn't an excuse for stealing other people's food.\n\nMaybe he needs more help in this area than you can give him?\n\nIn the meantime, hide that food! Possibly even get a lockbox for special treats. NTA", "Seriously though! In 4 days I ate my muffins and he ate all of his muffins AND all the fritters! Like dude, you could at least be considerate and ask! It seems so stupid but after so long I'm just so frustrated with it!", "Or\u2026.you know! OP has a normal portion size every couple of days as they feel \u201cin the mood\u201d for cheezits!\n\nMETa:  and what\u2019s this \u201cbaked goods need to be eaten they only last 1.5 weeks tops\u201d stuff? \n\nOP bought the fritters on the 2nd and posted this on the 6th. \n\nThat\u2019s *four days*. Four days.", "They each got their own pack of muffins and one communal 6 pack of fritters. \n\nMost muffin packs are 4-6 per pack? So that\u2019s at minimum, 4 muffins and 6 fritters in *4 days*. That\u2019s a lot of snacks already. In addition to whatever else they have?", "Would putting them in a breadbox type thing with a sign to \u201cremind\u201d him work?   If it\u2019s ADD, the reminder should work? It\u2019s so selfish of him to keep doing this.  NTA.", "I have ADHD and can eat until I feel sick if I don't pay attention. I stop that by dividing everything into individual portions so I can grab one portion instead of an entire container. That way it doesn't matter if I zone out while eating.", "I can eat 4 muffins in a day if I\u2019m having a snackish moment\u2026I\u2019m just saying, if he is a big eater, then maybe he needs two packs of personal muffins \ud83e\udd14", "I do portions too. Because I will mindlessly eat until I eat the lot.", "I was thinking from a cost POV, especially since we don\u2019t know what other snacks they have, and the current cost of food. Bakery items tend to be more expensive than say\u2026chips\u2026or even a box of hostess stuff.", "What?? You do know that tamales are made in batches of discreet numbers right? And that they can be cut in half? What a bonkers response", "You are acting like this is an OP issue. \n\nIt\u2019s not. She\u2019s doing this in response to *his* issue. He\u2019s the AH. \n\nHe\u2019s the one taking more than his ~~fat~~ fair* share, and he\u2019s not even *asking* if she\u2019s done an and can he have one of her tamales or fritters. He just eats. That\u2019s mannerless.\n\n\n*note-my phone just updated and my autocorrect is of the hissy with mistakes. I don\u2019t even know WTF is going on. It took 4 edits to get this correction right. I really meant \u201cfair\u201d the first time around."]}
