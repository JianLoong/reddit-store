I get it would have been nice to let them know but life happens.", "Ok my official ruling is NTA.  \n\nI personally think having this be a \"rule\" is absurd.  Life doesn't always stick to schedules.  You pay for the use of the apartment, and that includes the facilities of said apartment.\n\nIt is reasonable for the roommate sharing the wall with the bathroom to request that the shower not be used when they are sleeping.

If you don\u2019t do it regularly, you learned to be more considerate about it, and you\u2019re unlikely to do it again.

It's also helping me break out of the habit of sleeping on my stomach with my head turned an uncomfortable angle (the amount of times I've woken up with a crook neck) and I'm now sleeping mainly on my back, majorly helps the spine and with back pain.\n\nWhen you live in an apartment, you have to give up certain luxuries or at least find a way to adapt when you live in a shared space.

There's other instances I can think of, but they all involve other bodily fluids and I'll just spare you the graphic images racing through my brain right now.", "Yeah you're right but I couldn't be arsed writing a paragraph on sleep.", "yes, but its honestly a stupid rule. \n\nOP pays for a room and use of the communal spaces, which includes the bathroom. saying \u201cdont use this space you pay to use between these hours bc it inconveniences me\u201d should be taken as a **request**, not something set in stone, because sometimes breaking said rule is going to be unavoidable.", "Then you need to understand that you can't control people by making up fake rules, the end.", "Right of course. I'm dumb. Great argument. Let's put it like this, see if you can understand. If it's not written on a conteact signed by the tenants, then the rule is not official and can be changed. How about this, do you get it now kiddo?", "Unofficial rule not on the lease.", "Bad rule was agreed to. \n\nUnreasonable expectations lol apparently everyone else can do it, so *unreasonable* to not wake other housemates up.\n\nDon't tell me to grow up when you're clearly a fucking child.", "That last part. My husband leaves for work at 5am so he showers at 4:30am. I can\u2019t imagine asking him to change his schedule for me. This rule works until someone has a work schedule that doesn\u2019t conform\n\nMaybe the roommate should ask to switch rooms if they can\u2019t handle noise from a shower. \n\nBeing woken at 6am is not that bad. Sure OP should have warned the roommate but this does not reach sending angry text message level of harassment that\u2019s happening", "Not really? It\u2019s not like I wasn\u2019t allowed to leave the room and not use the toilet, it was to limit a sudden loud noise in the middle of the night as to not wake my already overworked and under-slept parents.", "Yeah, because the only person showering next to my room is me.\n\nBut the roommates had a house rule before OP moved in. If you don't like a rule, say something.\n\nOr be polite and inform them of being outside it only once. It's how mature adults handle shared living spaces.", "The rule was established prior to him moving in and the one flat mate wanted that as a rule. The others agreed or, at least, didn\u2019t seem to care that much.\n\nOP didn\u2019t agree or disagree with it. He was indifferent about it because the rule didn\u2019t effect him. But in the context of the story it finally did.\n\nHim living at the house and not voicing anything is accepting the rule. Ignoring something doesn\u2019t give you a free pass.\n\nHe forgot to tell the flatware he needed the shower. That\u2019s really all that matters here. If he thinks it\u2019s still a stupid rule they should have a house meeting and discuss it.", "If I got yelled at, fuck them too.\n\nThey could have sent a message mentioning the time agreement and to be more mindful of others in the place. They instead start it off with berating? Not doing shit.", "But there are exceptions. All you have to do is tell the flatmate.\n\nAlso frankly all OP had to do was apologize but instead he brushed it off and more or less pointed the finger at the flat mate. So the way he handled it after puts him in TA territory more.", "So here's my take on it. We're hearing the story from the perspective of the person who did the inconveniencing. We're judging the person who was inconvenienced without knowing anything about their situation. What we do know is that there was an agreement. OP does also accept that they didn't think to inform their flat mate, which means it was something that could be done but wasn't for said reason. I agree in a house share things happen like this. A little bit of empathy from either side could have prevented such a post having been made, if only there was some communication prior to it. OP also says they've explained it to their flat mate so maybe it's settled amongst themselves. But it doesn't change the fact that what happened here was that a sleeping person did get woken up unexpectedly by someone who agreed not to do so. That's the fact that we know for sure.", "Oh look, finally someone with a brain around here. Thank you sir, for being more eloquent than me. That's literally my point.", "Sometimes someone\u2019s gotta shower at an inconvenient time, that\u2019s just life. But a little heads-up the night before really doesn\u2019t take that much effort and is a nice thing to do.", ">Right of course. I'm dumb. \n\nYou're spot on, you ARE dumb"]}
