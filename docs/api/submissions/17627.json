Not a law", "YTA you clearly agreed with the rule up to this point, you should have said something the night before. You messed up, take the L.", "Technically yes YTAH but it shouldn't be THAT big of a deal. \nIf your flatmate refuses to move on or holds this over your head...they are AH. \n\nIt was a small miscommunication, not repeat behavior.", "YTA, could have easily told them your situation beforehand and made it a non issue", "YTA. Unless you found out about that work conference literally the night before, after the roommate fell asleep, you had time to mention it and just forgot to. Not a huge infraction as a one-off, but absolutely your fault.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you just got up early for fun and took a shower for no reason. Does this flatmate share a wall with the bathroom plumbing or something? Do you drop the shampoo bottle 8 times while showering? To me, the sound of someone showering is just what life sounds like. It\u2019s not unusually loud.", "I'm sorry but NTA if you live in a flat you have to deal with noise ,I live in a building of flats and hear other people showering , door buzzers and their washing machines occasionally when it's very quiet. Most of the time it doesn't bother me unless it's someone's loud music. 4 people sharing a bathroom who aren't related or in a relationship is also not that fun. It was a one off and you weren't doing it to be as asshole. You pay rent to live their you should be able to use the facilities,  sometimes a day goes different according to plan . I ordinarily wouldn't shower at early hours of the morning but I start work at 7am and I'm up at 5am so sorry for TMI comment but I have heavy periods and have to shower off sometimes in the night when I leak. \nIt was a one off.\nAlso 6am isn't even that early especially when there's four of you using a bathroom.", "YTA, you broke the rule.", "YTA.", "I'm leaning towards YTA because there was a set rule due the noise the shower makes and you broke the rule anyways. I assume if you're going to a work conference it wouldn't have been impossible to book a hotel or something.", "INFO: why didn't you shower before bed as presumably you were asleep before 10pm if you had such an early flight?", "YTA for agreeing in the first place, not to mention breaking it without notice. Having a shower curfew is insane and honestly a \"reasonable\" one would be like 1-5am not a whole 9 hours, so I'm not sure how you guys didn't foresee this as being an issue. \n\nYour roommate should ask about a rent reduction if it's that serious a disruption. Showering isn't like laundry that you just do when convenient, so they can't stop you.", "One person can't \"make a rule\"...", "NTA. Situations happen. Once off doesn't deserve such angry texts and phone calls. But a calm discussion about how to prevent it in the future and also an apology from you for forgetting to inform.", "OP should've told them in advance that they would need to use the shower outside of the agreed time.", "Some stupid legacy rule that was decided way before i moved in. I didn\u2019t explicitly agree to it but it\u2019s never affected me til now", "I comply the rest of the time because it so happens my routine falls between those hours. However if I had to get up early / shower late as part of my routine, I would outwardly disagree. One of the flat mates even sent me a recording of the shower\u2026 it just sounded like running water\u2026 nothing horrible like pipes rattling", "op isnt ta since they havent done this numerous times it was an accidental one and op just forgot.", "They do share a wall with the bathroom plumbing, and when one of them sent me a recording of the noise, it literally just sounded like\u2026 well, a shower. Without hearing it myself, I get the impression they\u2019re all feeding off each others hysteria and it\u2019s draining (pardon yne pun)", "I\u2019m assuming he had more than even a couple weeks to let him know about it too. More than 12 hours to take a shower and he had to wake him an hour before. I agree YTA. I also see your flatmates not defending you so that tells me you were out of line.", "For more context: I was up til 1am preparing for this speech and was anxious about it. I agreed to the rule because generally I get up at 9 and shower around 7, and it hasn\u2019t been an issue. There was no shower at the conference venue and since the venue booked my flight, i didn\u2019t have time to check into a hotel before my speech", "I was up til 1am preparing for this speech and was anxious about it.

Nobody wants to go somewhere not being fresh and having that overnight oil on their skin. What is it with you shower before bed weirdos thinking that you can just force that twisted worldview on everyone else.\n\nThe man had to give a speech who wants to give a damned speech having not showered since the night before.", "Yeah, hate to say but YTA here. \n\nBut, I stand by my ruling by fiat comment. If you want to change the rule I think you have the right to bring it up. Or back out of the agreement. With 4 roommates, not being able to shower until 7 puts a pretty big rush on the shower in the morning (assuming everyone works). But, of course, if you opt out they could always vote you out of the flat for showering at random times. Prob not worth it for a one time problem. \n\n(Must admit, this is an odd one to me. I lived in places where the showers could disturb people, we all just rolled over and went back to sleep. Folks tried to be courteous about showering very late/very early, but there were no shower rules)", "Then don\u2019t sweat it. Not on you. If you have a laid back nature and don\u2019t fight things loudly and often then your whiney roomie might assume you agree with them or consider that tacit approval. \n\nYou miiight have to calmly advocate for yourself and just steadfastly stand your ground.\n\nDon\u2019t let the squeaky wheel steamroll you.", "I meant are you someone who usually showers before bed or when you wake up (or both)?", "Why is it \u201ctwisted\u201d to shower in the evenings rather than the mornings? \ud83d\ude02", "Sorry, did I say at any point they should've showered before bed? I asked why they didn't as I'm aware there are shower before bed people and shower in the morning people (and those that do both as I do). \n\nThey didn't include that information in their post and I think it's important to understand. If they don't object to pre-bed showers then that would make OP the AH as they could've done exactly that. If they will only shower in the morning then that would mean they aren't an AH.", "Lol yes this is me", "Usually before bed, but I wanted to be fresh before the conference and had no feasible opportunity to shower later. Her life was inconvenienced for all of 5 minutes", "Shower at whatever fucked up time you want but expecting other people to want to get up out of their bed and take on the day without having a proper shower is twisted. Also I already explained why it is twisted. \n\nLike you are telling me that you will wake up in the morning and potentially take a shit and then just put your pants on and go outside? With no shower? And you are all oily from overnight? These are nasty unhygienic fuckers that cannot be trusted.", "I\u2019m disabled so showering in the morning before having to do stuff isn\u2019t really an option for me pal. You seriously need to chill out, you\u2019re getting far too worked up about someone else\u2019s showering habits."]}
