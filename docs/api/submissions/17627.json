I get it would have been nice to let them know but life happens.", "Ok my official ruling is NTA.  \n\nI personally think having this be a \"rule\" is absurd.  Life doesn't always stick to schedules.  You pay for the use of the apartment, and that includes the facilities of said apartment.\n\nIt is reasonable for the roommate sharing the wall with the bathroom to request that the shower not be used when they are sleeping.

It's also helping me break out of the habit of sleeping on my stomach with my head turned an uncomfortable angle (the amount of times I've woken up with a crook neck) and I'm now sleeping mainly on my back, majorly helps the spine and with back pain.\n\nWhen you live in an apartment, you have to give up certain luxuries or at least find a way to adapt when you live in a shared space.

Still, even with the rule which you seem to be totally respectful of, this was a one off and your flatmates seem like they just jumped on the chance to attack you over something totally innocuous.

There are things we have to deal with to get by that aren\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault.  \n\nIf you can\u2019t handle these things, go live in a hut in the forest or whatever, or get rich enough you can buy you way out of normal life.

If so then YTA, if you knew you needed to break the rule why not tell them ahead of time or try to work something out.", "YTA The explanation seems to forget why the rule was imposed.

You should allways prepare them and ask permission.", "I think I'd find that a bit annoying while I sleep and end up removing them.", "If they knew they had to break the rule why not work something out, to just do it without planning is just selfish", "I kind of understand where he's coming from as I have the room next to the shower, and my headboard is against the wall that the shower/tub is attached to, so when the water hits it sounds quite loud. I can't change the orientation of the bed nor change sleeping positions due to the placement of the radiator in the room and lack of space. It does get loud enough to wake me up from deep sleep. I live in a house without rules but everyone sleeps late so it's no big deal. But when people do have to shower early it does end up waking me. I'd say op was lacking in empathy but I guess there's not much anyone can do about it. One of the trade offs of living in shared accommodation.", "To be fair, if it\u2019s next to his room, there might be dodgy pipes that squeal etc, I\u2019d get annoyed waking up in the night if people were showering at weird times consistently.\n\nHowever, this time is a one off, with good reason.

That's loud enough.", "Maybe they're all Germans \ud83d\ude05", "Yeah, the time that you don't use the shower should be a request.  And it is a reasonable one considering the roommate shares a wall with the bathroom.  However, things happen and occasional you might have to do things outside the schedule.

Sure it\u2019s annoying and a bit painful, but I don\u2019t expect people to not do normal and daily life activities they need to do or to do them at special hours to accommodate me. Earplugs help. Some white noise helps. But in the end I just respect the other people who live with me the same way they respect me", "White noise machine", "Earplugs.", "I think 7 am sounds kinda late.

One person made this rule because he\u2019s the only one affected, and the other two are completely unaffected but still jumped in on the berate brigade which just sounds like they jumped at the chance to bully you bc they thought they could get away with it. Showering an hour earlier than the \u201callotted window of time\u201d is not a big deal, and their rigidity is going to make their lives a lot more difficult than the odd early morning shower. And like, it\u2019s a shower. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re doing construction in there. They need to get over it. Don\u2019t let them gang up and gaslight you into feeling bad over something completely innocuous. I\u2019d recommend standing up for yourself and not letting them get away with this because this kind of treatment can get really out of hand and even tho you can\u2019t control their neurotic, controlling, domineering, immature behavior, you can let them know they can\u2019t pull that shit with you without consequence which will hopefully make them back off.

I know a lot of people prefer night showering but not me", "It might be an insane rule, but it's one he agreed on.

They're 4 people trying to coexist in a house, and used rules to facilitate this. If they had an agreement isn't it fair to expect people to stick to what they agreed on? In that case isn't what happened here going against what they agreed on, and hence unfair? But that's life innit.", "But everyone in the flat agreed to it.
