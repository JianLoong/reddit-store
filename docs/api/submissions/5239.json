Even for the ones which deemed me the ah. I tried to respond to all of them but after the 100th comment it became hard to keep up but I did read all of them :)\n\nFor those who are interested I have something to update on my family Christmas and my brother. He called yesterday and wanted to come over to talk. When he got here he started by apologizing on his part of the argument admitting that he acted poorly. He told me he hadn\u2019t really paid much attention on the menu since I was in charge of it. And thus when he suggested we cut out my side he didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d practically nothing else to eat and in the heat of the moment he couldn\u2019t take that into account.\n\nHe then went on to tell me something I didn\u2019t quite expect him to since he isn\u2019t one to really talk about these kinds of things. I won\u2019t go into too much detail but when I was a baby and he was young our family went through some financial hardships. I\u2019m too young to remember it but it left a mark on him. He said that this is what behind his reaction and he was sorry for letting his anxieties get a hold of him. He did reassure me that his intention wasn\u2019t to exclude me.\n\nHe offered to pay for my side and asked me if there is anything else I wanted to have but I told him I was fine with this side. As there was some concern regarding the division of labour and me paying for my own main when theirs was included in the family budget I did raise the issue and said I\u2019d however appreciate if they pitched a bit more in the terms of labour. He agreed and said we really should include my main in the budget as well. So I told him I would send him recipes and instructions and would be available for advice if they needed it. I\u2019m still doing most of the labour but I consider this fair and not aa a harship. They\u2019ll do the dishes after though as I hate those\n\nI also asked what made him think about his actions and he told me it was really hard not to come to the realization that he acted poorly when everyone he cares about is mad at him - including his wife. And on top of that he didn\u2019t feel good about the though of leaving things like that and of not having me over for Christmas. So yeah, I don\u2019t think I cut him too much slack in the end even if some thought so. He can be a little misguided sometimes but he is not a bad person. It just sometimes takes a little bit of time for him to come around. There is definitely work to be done regarding him respecting other people\u2019s opinions but I have hope for him still\n\nI did apologize for my actions too so don\u2019t worry about that. I wasn\u2019t completely blameless in how things progressed after all \n\nSo I guess this means that we will have our family Christmas despite this hiccup. We might try to figure out a solution that\u2019s fair for all for next Christmas. Be it a potluck or something else.\n\nAnyway I do hope that everyone has a wonderful holiday!

Based on your replies to the original post you sounded very level-headed and reasonable, so I'm not surprised.", "That is great news! Good for you to talk it out like grownups. We all like to think we are perfect and do everything perfect but we are human and make stupid mistakes. I know I had my fair share as well.

To have a happy family update on reddit is a true Christmas miracle!", "Yay!!!", "So happy to hear that things worked out. If you spend too much time on this thread, you might believe that all people are walking red flags and controlling. It was heartening to see someone take advice and then just. work it out. Congrats and I hope you and your family have an amazing holiday.", "Wow.  So you mean it would have been a bad idea to go no contact?  GEe, I thought, based on reddit, that was the solution to all minor squabbles you have with your family.\n\nI'm glad it worked out for you\n\nEdit:  I love how this gets downvoted.  For basically saying, don't cut people off over minor shit, I get downvoted.  This sub is a trip", "So glad things worked out. Have a great Christmas.", "Oh thank you for linking the original one.\n\nAnd yeah, I guess. For us it\u2019s almost a week old argument but I\u2019m glad we had the chance to work it out relatively quickly. It really was like an aching tooth for both of us so I\u2019m relieved that we didn\u2019t have suffer that much longer :)", "Thank you :)", "Yes this is very true. I think we all deserve some grace from time to time. I have been given it on multiple occasions by family so I\u2019m glad to give it to someone deserving as well in return\n\nAnd merry Christmas to you too!", "A cute angle, if you will\n\n/ I'll see myself out", "It can sometimes seem like so.

Merry Christmas!", "Info: I'm interested in this spread recipe.", "It only worked out, because everyone else was mad at the brother because of his behavior, especially his own wife. So he \u201capologized\u201d I think OP should still be careful.", "Don't be obtuse.  Surely, they're referring to the dihedral angle, between the left and right wings of the aircraft.", "Something on AITA was resolved by an adult conversation! It's a Christmas Miracle!  \n\n\nHonestly, I'm genuinely happy you all were able to talk this through.", "A happy ending. Love it.", "I'm so glad you all were able to sort things out!

I wish good things to your entire family this holiday season and into the next year.", "I\u2019m glad you worked it out", "Ooh warm and fuzzies! I'm so pleased it's all sorted out now, and that your brother had a bit of an epiphany and explained everything. Have a super Christmas, all of you!", "I love seeing these updates.  Thank you!  I read your post a while ago but there was a substantial amount of judgements and were well written that I need not add to it.\n\nI am glad that you and your brother communicated.  I feel a lot of issues can be addressed with open and proper communication.\n\nI hope you and your family have a pleasant holiday!", "So glad that worked out for you, OP!  It's always nice to get a happy ending here.", "Glad everything worked out. Hope you all have a Merry Christmas!", "NTA. Glad you and your brother had a talk and cleared the air. Now you and your family can have a nice celebration, without extra drama. Overcoming the food hurdle for this year, will make next Christmas even better. Merry Christmas to you.", "Thank you for the update. Hope this is the start of better understanding between you. Merry Christmas!", "So happy to hear when people on here act like actual imperfect but just human people\n\nIt's ok to be wrong and admit it and forgive it in people we love\n\nWe're all just trying our best here\n\nNo need to just cut ppl off as ppl here often want to do. We can grow together.", "We love a happy ending! Happy Christmas!!", "Awww, this is awesome. Congrats on handling it so well.", "I love for wholesome AITA resolutions.

I'm glad he elected to talk with you and not at you and that you both were able to communicate. Nobody's perfect, but your brother did make the effort, which is HUGE. Happy Holidays!", "Well this is only a small snapshot into our life and there is much more to my brother than this. And those are the reasons why I want to be in his life and I want him in mine. I make mistakes as well and he has forgiven me for them after I have tried my best to make amends. I don\u2019t see how this situation is much different really", "Did \u201creddit\u201d advocate she cut contact in this case?  Which responses said that?", "That doesn't really seem resolved. Time will tell, but that sounded like a pretty empty apology/excuse. There's a pretty good chance history will repeat, then you'll be the bad guy for caring when you \"know about his childhood anxieties\".\n\nIt's super easy to tell people what they want to hear, then return to the status quo.\n\nI'm happy you're psyched about this, but it would be wise to consider how you'll implement boundaries if this continues. Change is reflected in actions, not words.\n\nBest of luck!", "This is such a good update. I'm so glad things worked out.", "Word. I'm glad it worked out. Being a family is hard and I'm glad that open honest communication was able to get you guys on the right path. Best of luck, and enjoy your family time! Happy Holidays!", "I love these updates with happy endings.  Thank you OP for the reddit Merry Christmas update!", "Yay!", "You are right about that. And I would not have forgiven him if the only thing he offered was words and excuses. But he didn\u2019t and that makes all the difference for me. Only time will tell how all this will end but I\u2019m happy with how things are progressing now \n\nBut I do see what you mean so thank you for your comment. Happy holidays to you! :)", "What a sweet person you are!! I\u2019m happy everything worked out! We don\u2019t see that in here often! I hope you have a wonderful Christmas!!! Many happy new years!! Merry Christmas!", "Yeah I get him managing to miss that.  It can be hard to keep track of food restrictions and easy to forget XYZ dish has [ingredient].\n\nOur youngest has along list of foods she can't eat and way too many times I think I've found a recipe/food she can only to realize and cry a little bit. \n\nGlad he realized his mistake and apologized.  Financial insecurity is really hard to recover from emotionally.  I have panics about things as well- it's mostly inwardly focused, and tends to look like making sure everyone else around me is fed but not being able to bring myself to eat out of fear. Which isn't better than lashing out like he does.", "Happy holidays OP, it is good to see everyone being an adult here and thinking through what happened and how to make things better!", "> I did apologize for my actions too so don\u2019t worry about that. \n\nWhich ones?\n\n> I wasn\u2019t completely blameless in how things progressed after all\n\nDid you leave something big out of the story?", "Merry Christmas!!", "This is a wonderful update.  And it sounds like you and your brother might become closer after this.  Happy Holidays!!", "I find his excuse lacking personally. I do understand having an impact. My grandmother pinched pennies all her life after the great depression. She lived with us and we had a big family and she always skimped on food, even though my parents had plenty of money. So I do get that can happen. But the way brother handled it seems more like an excuse than the actual reason he did it. Not that I blame OP for accepting it and moving forward. But I agree with you that it doesn't feel resolved and that he might have just said what OP wanted to hear.", "I don\u2019t think I did. I apologized mainly for not giving him the benefit of doubt and thus jumping to the conlusion that he meant to be malicious. While I think that in the situation it was understandable, it did hurt him that I couldn\u2019t think better than that of him then. So I did apologize for the hurt I caused.\n\nI know some might think I was justified in my reaction and don\u2019t need to apologize but for me that\u2019s not all that matters. I care more about \u201dus\u201d than me being \u201dright\u201d so it\u2019s no skin off my back to acknowledge that I can still be hurtful while someone hurts me \u201dworse\u201d", "A good update! Food insecurity as a child really can affect you for the rest of your life so I get where he\u2019s coming from. I have trouble not snapping at people who come over and help themselves to food I specifically bought for visitors because my brain panics \u201cwhat if I need that, what if I run out of food because of this\u201d he should talk to a therapist about it! Glad he apologized though.", "He clearly wants you in his life too which is why he apologized and compromised. I\u2019m so happy for you.", "I'm glad to hear he was willing to own his issues and his part in them. That's the kind of thing that actually is hopeful.\n\nSo often particularly here, people who do AH behaviors double down when confronted with how their behaviors impact other people.\n\nIt's a welcome change when someone isn't.", "This account is run by scammers and used as a fake customer."]}
