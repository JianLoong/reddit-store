Even for the ones which deemed me the ah. I tried to respond to all of them but after the 100th comment it became hard to keep up but I did read all of them :)\n\nFor those who are interested I have something to update on my family Christmas and my brother. He called yesterday and wanted to come over to talk. When he got here he started by apologizing on his part of the argument admitting that he acted poorly. He told me he hadn\u2019t really paid much attention on the menu since I was in charge of it. And thus when he suggested we cut out my side he didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d practically nothing else to eat and in the heat of the moment he couldn\u2019t take that into account.\n\nHe then went on to tell me something I didn\u2019t quite expect him to since he isn\u2019t one to really talk about these kinds of things. I won\u2019t go into too much detail but when I was a baby and he was young our family went through some financial hardships. I\u2019m too young to remember it but it left a mark on him. He said that this is what behind his reaction and he was sorry for letting his anxieties get a hold of him. He did reassure me that his intention wasn\u2019t to exclude me.\n\nHe offered to pay for my side and asked me if there is anything else I wanted to have but I told him I was fine with this side. As there was some concern regarding the division of labour and me paying for my own main when theirs was included in the family budget I did raise the issue and said I\u2019d however appreciate if they pitched a bit more in the terms of labour. He agreed and said we really should include my main in the budget as well. So I told him I would send him recipes and instructions and would be available for advice if they needed it. I\u2019m still doing most of the labour but I consider this fair and not aa a harship. They\u2019ll do the dishes after though as I hate those\n\nI also asked what made him think about his actions and he told me it was really hard not to come to the realization that he acted poorly when everyone he cares about is mad at him - including his wife. And on top of that he didn\u2019t feel good about the though of leaving things like that and of not having me over for Christmas. So yeah, I don\u2019t think I cut him too much slack in the end even if some thought so. He can be a little misguided sometimes but he is not a bad person. It just sometimes takes a little bit of time for him to come around. There is definitely work to be done regarding him respecting other people\u2019s opinions but I have hope for him still\n\nI did apologize for my actions too so don\u2019t worry about that. I wasn\u2019t completely blameless in how things progressed after all \n\nSo I guess this means that we will have our family Christmas despite this hiccup. We might try to figure out a solution that\u2019s fair for all for next Christmas. Be it a potluck or something else.\n\nAnyway I do hope that everyone has a wonderful holiday!

Based on your replies to the original post you sounded very level-headed and reasonable, so I'm not surprised.", "That is great news! Good for you to talk it out like grownups. We all like to think we are perfect and do everything perfect but we are human and make stupid mistakes. I know I had my fair share as well. Merry Christmas to you and your family OP!", "Sounds like a Christmas angle got his wings!", "Such a great update! To have a happy family update on reddit is a true Christmas miracle!", "Yay!!!", "So happy to hear that things worked out. If you spend too much time on this thread, you might believe that all people are walking red flags and controlling. It was heartening to see someone take advice and then just. work it out. Congrats and I hope you and your family have an amazing holiday.", "Wow.  So you mean it would have been a bad idea to go no contact?  GEe, I thought, based on reddit, that was the solution to all minor squabbles you have with your family.\n\nI'm glad it worked out for you", "So glad things worked out. Have a great Christmas.", "Oh thank you for linking the original one.\n\nAnd yeah, I guess. For us it\u2019s almost a week old argument but I\u2019m glad we had the chance to work it out relatively quickly. It really was like an aching tooth for both of us so I\u2019m relieved that we didn\u2019t have suffer that much longer :)", "Thank you :)", "Yes this is very true. I think we all deserve some grace from time to time. I have been given it on multiple occasions by family so I\u2019m glad to give it to someone deserving as well in return\n\nAnd merry Christmas to you too!", "A cute angle, if you will\n\n/ I'll see myself out", "It can sometimes seem like so. I thought it would do people good to see a more hopeful update this time around though :)", "You too! :)", "And the holiday dad jokes have begun."]}
