I  told  her it was ok and she didn't look upset or anything just sorry  she had  scared me and she went back to her show. My mom asked me if I  was ok and  I told her I was now and that I just had a panic attack and  that was  it.\n\nA few days later my  mom was  talking to one of her friends who had come over and we were on  the  subject of my niece.

I've had panic attacks over way sillier things, we really can't control it. I think you handled it really well, you didn't yell or make your niece feel bad. if I was sitting in a silent room and suddenly someone started screaming I'd probably have the same reaction as you honestly. kids are loud and annoying sometimes but hopefully she'll learn how to control it eventually", "NTA and your mother could have a little more empathy.", "YTA\nMom is also AH\nFamily of AH\nSo you reacted to your 7 yr old niece and freaked out. How does this happen? Also your mom is rude. Niece W", "NTA - you can\u2019t control when you have a panic attack.", "*you're", "NTA", "NTA- you can\u2019t control when you have a panic attack.\n\nHowever, your family\u2019s need to work on how you react to your niece and find some better ways to encourage her to be quite rather than saying she\u2019s \u2018too loud\u2019 like she\u2019s problematic. Why is she so loud? Does she struggle with hearing? Does she have a neurodiversity eg ADHD. It appears you also have sensory overloading issues. \n\nI think your Mum is an AH for minimising your experience. I think you also need to sit down with your niece and explain why you had to leave the house & she\u2019s not at fault (bc she may be feeling awful about it) and that she needs to work on her indoor voice as you can here her perfectly well in the house.", "Thanks. I\u2019m not so sure she\u2019ll learn because she\u2019s been doing this for years and my sister doesn\u2019t tell her to quiet down. Hopefully she\u2019ll just grow out of it.", "Yeah good one, shit on mental health issues more", "I did freak out but I didn't freak out AT HER. She scared me and I tried to calm down but I couldn't so I took myself away from the situation.", "So, op had an anxiety attack and your take away is to victim blame and call her an asshole.  Real big of you buddy *slow clap*", "Thanks for the comment! I understand but there\u2019s not much I can do since I\u2019m not her mom. When she\u2019s around and screams I remind her to quiet down but her mom doesn\u2019t do the same at their house. It\u2019s also a bit awkward to discipline my niece around her mom because her mom doesn\u2019t do it.\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned to my mom a few times that she should get evaluated for ADHD and autism but my sister has a lot on her plate and it\u2019s not a priority to her at the moment.", "Just cause your a victim does not mean you can\u2019t be an AH", "She may not be recognising when she is being super loud and may have trouble adjusting it in the home. It doesn\u2019t have to be discipline but just a gentle reminder (in a quieter voice) to lower her voice as you feel like she\u2019s shouting at you. She most likely will lower her voice in reply. \n\nIf you are becoming uncomfortable and you\u2019re not able to change it then maybe look at your triggers as to when you\u2019re getting on edge? Maybe after a while you could go into your own room and get a break or go for a walk etc if you\u2019re feeling sensory overload?", "Sorry I didn\u2019t mean discipline. I did mean just asking her to talk more quietly. My mom and I remind her to talk more quietly and she does for 10 minutes but goes back to talking loudly. \n\nThis incident happened after three days of her staying with us so I was completely exhausted. She wakes up really early and talks constantly so I was sleep deprived and is probably the reason all of this triggered a panic attack. \n\nI\u2019ve had anxiety for 18 years so I know how to deal with it as best I can and I\u2019ve had 2 panic attacks this year so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue."]}
