My mom's favorite thing to do is play video games on her spare time, it's how I was even introduced to them. This Christmas, I (19F), decided I was going to go all out and surprise her with one. I didn't know how I was going to get it, considering I don\u2019t have a job, but I still went on the official playstation website to look and what do you know! A PS5 with her favorite game was in a bundle. I decided to bite the bullet and use my credit card to purchase it, getting a temporary job to support the payments. It's been about 3 days since then. I have an interview Monday.\nNow onto the confrontation.\nWhile I was pulling into the yard with my sister (14F) in the passenger, UPS arrived also. I wasn't expecting it to be this early. I knew I wouldn't be able to hide the package away, so I faced the reality that I wouldn't be able to surprise my mom on Christmas and I had to give it to her now. I took the package t my parent's room put it on the bed. I told sorry and that it was supposed to be a Christmas surprise from me to her, and I gave her my key to open it.\n\nMy sister asked if she could be the one to open it, and my mom said yes. When she opened the box her smile dropped and she looked at me with an angry expression. I felt my heart drop. My sister asked why I would do this, as if she felt betrayed or something. I told her the truth and that I wanted to surprise mom considering we BOTH KNEW how badly mom wanted one.\n\nShe yelled at me that this was \"unfair\" and that \"you knew I wanted one\". Now I'm aggravated, but I tried to keep my composure. My mom said she would share, but this wasn't enough. She threw down the receipt paper that came in the box and ran off to her room.\n\nMy mom tried to assure me that it really wasn't my fault, but when my dad came home and he was told the situation by my mother, he was upset with me. He basically told me I should've known better then and that I should've accounted for this reaction. He even thinks that I did this to bother her. In a way he's right, because she's unfortunately very spoiled.\nI never intended to hurt anyone in this situation. I never even intended for them to find out I purchased a PS5 until Christmas day. My intentions were to make my mother happy. My mother is upset with my sister for the reaction and has told me not to worry about it that she appreciates my gesture. I thought my sister would be more mature than this but I guess not. My sister isn't talking to me, and she even ate dinner in her room. I'm left feeling confused and conflicted after my dad's words and l'd like to hear another opinion or maybe even some possible suggestions to solve this because I don't want her to hate me for this, as I already have a strained relationship with her for other reasons.

Like did she want it as much as your mom did? Did she and your mom ever talk about it? \n\nTo me it sounds like she's jealous of her own mom for owning a PS5??? Like, your mom even offered to share (and honestly most moms would want to share?). I really don't get why she's upset.\n\nCan you also explain your dad's reaction? Why does he think you might have anticipated this?\n\n(I'm sure you can tell, to an outsider, this situation makes no sense.)", "NTA. if I had acted like that at 14 the lecture on manners would have been a long one. She is a selfish brat that should know better. If your father is enabling this behavior you can't do much about it. Is she vindictive enough to damage the system since it was given to someone else? If she is there is more wrong there than being a brat. Is she mentally ill or has no one called her on this absolutely inappropriate behavior?", "NTA Firstly, that was extremely generous of you to buy her such an expensive and thoughtful gift. Your sister is an entitled, spoiled, jealous asshole. And your father is an asshole for enabling her behavior and having the audacity to get mad at you for purchasing your mother such a nice gift. A gift, I might add, that she offered to share with your sister. No household needs two game consoles, that is just absurd.\n\nYou did ABSOLUTELY nothing wrong. Please try talking to your mother to see if she can get your father to back off a bit. As for your sister, just give her space.", "NTA\n\nYou're buying a game console for your mother, odds are (or at least were) very good that it would wind up in the living room for the whole family to use, if they followed mom's rules.\n\nYour sister was out of line.  And I suspect your mother will be hesitant to set up the game, now, for fear of your sister doing damage to it in retaliation. \n\nA fourteen year old does not need a new game console when there is a perfectly good one for the family to share.  A little kindness and respect to the mother, and I expect your sister would have been able to play it quite a bit. \n\nAs it is now, how will you set it up safely?", "NTA PlayStation 5s aren\u2019t cheap and she isn\u2019t your child to be getting expensive gifts for unless you want to. It\u2019s your money to buy a present for who you want. She\u2019ll be alright.", "She's a bratty teenager. You did something great and your mom deserved it.

Your sister is acting like a bit of a brat. She's old enough to understand not everything is about her", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t owe your sister anything. She sounds like a spoiled brat.", "NTA that was a grand gesture to your mom and was so sweet!) Your sister is acting entitled, possibly to get your mom to give the gift to her, and it sounds like dad is in favor of this. Sister wont change as long as dad encourages her childish and entitled behavior. This gift is between you and your mom, your sister and dad are in the wrong.", "NTA and that was very sweet of you to do. You can tell your dad that you'd be happy to purchase another one for your sister....with his credit card!\n\nIt's no wonder your sister is so spoiled with your dad behaving like that! What parent acts like that?! Perhaps he was upset that you got your mom such a thoughtful and expensive gift and wants one too? I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Good thing your apple seems to take after your momma!", "If she wasn't such a spoiled brat, this gift to her mother wouldn't have hurt her. And BTW, she's not hurt, she's angry because her mommy got a gift and she didn't. \n\nDad's an enabler who apparently created a monster. \n\nNTA", "Maybe I made an error in the way I explained it but I for real never wanted to hurt her. I said \u201cIn a way, he\u2019s right because she\u2019s very spoiled\u201d (not verbatim but yeah) because that\u2019s what he essentially told me. He told me I should\u2019ve accounted for her to behave in such a way. Thank you for your perspective though, I appreciate it and will learn from this mistake.", "For sure!\n\nI didn\u2019t even know my sister wanted a PS5. She\u2019s the type to play nintendo games like me, and some roblox. My father has even purchased her a switch lite for her birthday this year and we have all even bought her many a robux since then. She has games on nintendo, and I already share my games I have with her. During christmas time, our parents tell us to make a list and give it to them and they\u2019ll pick and choose what they\u2019ll purchase. As of this comment, I\u2019ve asked my mother and my sister has yet to give her list to our parents.\n\nI believe my dad\u2019s reaction is because he\u2019s raised us with the \u201cIll buy the same for both\u201d mentality since were close in age range and we tend to like the same things. I\u2019ll go back to the nintendo example: I have a switch and she has a switch lite. I have no idea what it\u2019s like to raise a child so I can\u2019t really comment, but based on the comments I\u2019ve seen so far it seems he\u2019s made a mistake with that teaching and it\u2019s affecting us now. This kind of thing hasn\u2019t happened since she was 10, and even then it wasn\u2019t as bad as this.", "Yes, she\u2019s done some pretty vindictive behavior in the past (and was punished accordingly by my parents), but that\u2019s when she was around 9-10 years old. However, she does love our mom and she does know how much something like this would cost to replace so I doubt she would do something to the PS5. To me? As for my personal belongings? I\u2019m not so sure. Honestly, nothing is out of the question, and my mom currently has the system plugged up to the TV in my parent\u2019s room. I\u2019ll just have to wait and see, unfortunately.", "Yes it was as you expected: it was going to be in the living room along with our other gaming system. However due to the reaction, my mom is keeping it in our parent\u2019s room until this ordeal is over. I don\u2019t expect her to damage the system, but considering this unexpected reaction we really don\u2019t know. Someday she\u2019ll be able to use it but at my mother\u2019s discretion. Thank you for your comment!", "This exactly. I nearly preordered the COD bundle just to get a ps5 but decided to wait a bit longer to get one.  You did a nice thing.  Your dad must be the one who spoils your sister more than your mom because of his reaction. Ignore the whole bs tantrum she is throwing and she'll get over it.\n\nNTA", "I might have misunderstood, it was a nice gift and can't relate enough to make a sound judgement.\n\nI have 2 Sisters and 1 brother and we surprise our mother with a gift from all of us.", "NTA.", "OK, so you clearly had no idea your sister could get hurt by this. So you are 100% NTA. \n\nBut I'm still puzzled by your dad's reaction. Let me explain why. If this was a situation where your mom got you a PS5 that you really wanted, but not for your sister who also wanted it, and if your dad got upset at your mom, then I'd get it. That would be a case of doing favoritism with a child. People really really really ought to treat their kids equally.\n\nBut like you are not a parent who is treating her kids unequally!!! Like, one is your mom and the other is your sister. OF COURSE you wouldn't treat them equally. Your mom raised you and gave birth to you. \n\nAnd that's why your sister's reaction is also puzzling to me. Why is she having sibling rivalry with her mom? It's her MOM!\n\nOP, idk why your dad is expecting you to act like a responsible parent here. You're still a teenager. And you've handled the situation like a true grown up. I'm kind of feeling pissed off at your dad here. If you think there is a good opportunity, when he's in a good mood, maybe you can talk to him about it and clear things up? Like IDK maybe he was having a bad day and that's why he was being unreasonable."]}
