If your SIL still have all this trauma from your husband being the golden child, your MIL can take steps to fix what her behavior caused.\n\nAs far as this specific conflict goes, SIL way overstepped and deserved to be taken down a notch.

Your trauma is not a permission slip to harm others.\n\nNTA", "Oh, she played the \"lived experience\" card!  And has a TikTok dedicated to her trauma!  SHE'S a bit extra.

While your husband continues to provide financial support for his family, it's crucial to prioritize the well-being of your innocent child.

Since they're freely saying the kind of things she did in front of everyone, it wouldn't be surprising if they try to instill their feelings, opinions to the next generation. Clearly, they want their brother to make up for being the golden child for the rest of his life. Their family needs to see a therapist.\n\nEdit: typo", "NTA. SIL has no business making armchair diagnoses of your parenting decisions. Teaching a nonverbal 3yo alternative communication skills is in no way setting unrealistic expectations. It\u2019s a prudent way to encourage a late bloomer to develop into language, and if there is an underlying medical cause, it\u2019s good for him to start learning early anyway. She\u2019s a 22yo know-it-all making determinations far above her pay grade in a way that is both disrespectful and arrogant. Her experiences are valid, but that doesn\u2019t make them relevant, and it doesn\u2019t mean you have to listen to her pontifications about how to raise children. She deserved to be called out, and it\u2019s a shame she seems to be surrounded by people who are coddling her sense of entitlement to rudely call you out over dinner about it.\n\nI can\u2019t say for sure what her trauma is, but it seems like she feels she was held to unfair expectations based on her older brother\u2019s success. Unless her parents were making her feel stupid for not living up to his success, it\u2019s hard for me to call that trauma. Perhaps she needs therapy, but it\u2019s hard to imagine therapy being productive when she is surrounded by people who enable and defend such behavior. It\u2019s furthermore hard to believe her parents were super hard on her when your MIL is asking you to apologize to SIL for not taking her crap lightly; if she\u2019s gonna coddle her to this degree at 22, it\u2019s hard to imagine she was coddling her less as a child. I\u2019m not typically dismissive of people claiming trauma, but she really seems to be milking her inability to get over childhood jealousy of her brother, and that isn\u2019t trauma. Even if there\u2019s something I\u2019m missing here, trauma doesn\u2019t excuse bad behavior.

How dare MIL ask you to apologize to HER.  I wouldn't talk to any of them anymore until they sincerely apologize without having to be asked", "My vibe is NTA but if the parent who originally created the golden child dynamic is still involved don't discount that the sister might have been hearing a lot of \"oh grandson is so smart learning sign language he's going to be bilingual\" without the real context.  \n\nPeople that create weird \"golden child\" dynamics love drama in my experience - ask some pointed questions about what she thinks is going on - the real troublemaker might be MIL or FIL.", "1)  Knowing 30 or so signs is not 'extra'.  It's pretty common.  Babies can sign before they can talk, tons of families learn a few dozen signs so babies can ask for milk before they can say the words. \n\n2) your kid is speech delayed.  A little 'extra' is not unwarranted. \n\n3) learning a few dozen signs isn't putting pressure on anyone.  It's relieving pressure, because your kid can communicate what he wants!\n\nYour SIL can't understand any of this, because she's not being rational.", "NTA - my brother is the golden child. He is perfection in my mother's eyes, and he can't do anything wrong. You know who I've never blamed? My brother. He didn't ask to be the first born. He didn't ask to have all my mom's attention. He didn't act like he was better than the rest of us. I love him dearly. I'm curious about how your husband responded to being the favorite. \n\nAlso! It is proven via study that sign language is extremely helpful in assisting *all children* to communicate, not just the ones that are developing at a slower rate. I have family members who are deaf or hard of hearing, so sign language is taught to everyone at a young age. My kids were signing before speaking, and it helped a whole bunch with communication at the toddler stages. I recommend sign language to all parents. \n\nLastly, even if her overall feelings are valid.. her current stance is 100% bullshit and she was projecting onto your son. You were not only defending your son, but also your husband and yourself as parents. She was all but accusing *you* of bad parenting. That's deserves harsh words and a swift end.", "Wtf?? NTA \n\nMy 3 year old and 16 month old both know basic signs for things they want. We started teaching them as soon as we could. It helps them communicate when they can't use words and help diffuse A LOT of tantrums. It's also a super common practice now even if you don't have a child who is hearing impaired, and honestly it should've been like this to begin with. \n\nYour SIL is wild and even wilder for trying to seek validation on tiktok about it.", "NTA. Your son is probably happier being able to express himself. Your sil is looking for problems that aren\u2019t there just to criticize.", "Sounds to me like your mother-in-law is the one that should be doing all this bending over backwards for the other siblings because she's the one that created the golden child scenario! This is not your husband's fault! He couldn't have changed it if he had to! Him paying for things for them is teaching them that if they manipulate him enough they can get money out of him.... And they are repeatedly doing it! Everybody got screwed in the situation of them growing up! It's not husbands or responsibility to try to make up for it but that's certainly going to hurt your kids by taking them around people that resent your husband while using him for money! NTA", "NTA. Sign language actually HELPS speech develop. I was a PreK teacher and had a mute student. I knew zero sign language until that year. I taught her, and the rest of the class, so many things in ASL. She was able to tell me all her colors, shapes, and letters. It was an amazing transformation. Now I teach my own child sign because like yours, he\u2019s slow to speak, no issues just getting there slower than average. He can sign some really important things like \u201chelp\u201d and \u201ceat\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d and \u201call done\u201d to name a few. Those were some of his first words that became clear versus babble. \n\nWhether it\u2019s another spoken language or sign, learning another language isn\u2019t pressure and perfection. It\u2019s a helpful skill in the short and long term!", "Only for saying \"your bullshit feelings\"\n\nHowever, she shouldn't have projected in the first place, but you could have probably tried to explain you guys aren't expecting perfection...

Your SIL has no clue what she's talking about, with regards to your son's speech, for one thing. She's also obviously self-centered as well, and ableist to boot.\n\nOne of mine had a speech delay issue - hers was from having many ear infections as a baby, which meant she didn't get enough auditory input for her brain to learn how to manipulate her mouth and tongue to produce the right sounds.\n\nShe was in speech therapy from 18 months to 10 years. By the time she entered school, she had improved a lot to where strangers could understand her most of the time. But more importantly, she had learned coping skills so she wasn't frustrated when someone couldn't understand her.\n\nOne of the first things her speech therapist taught her (and us) was basic sign language. She needed to be able to communicate her wants and needs reliably. Once she started learning some signs, she was SO much happier.

If she told her followers that she's belittling your families attempts to support your child? \n\nAlso I apologize if I'm overstepping - your childs doctor, was that their general ped or a speech therapist? If a general ped then they are doing you a disservice.    Yes, your child could be a late bloomer but that also is more common with an older child who didn't have a sibling or peers to speak with.\n \nYou should make an appointment. Ask for referral for a speech therapist due to language delays.\nReferrals in this field can really be far in scheduling due to provider shortages. I always recommend parents who are wondering if they should to get on a waiting list because you can always cancel your appointment if it's not needed later.  But there will always be some sort of wait for you receive any sort of services. Evaluations in my area can go 6 months to a year.  \n\nThere are a bunch of things that you can be doing that would help foster speech in a 3-year-old, outside  of signing. \n\nAnd at that age, what the therapy will look like will be the speech therapist training the parent to do the activities with the child.  Other ways your child is communicating with you that can be harder to pick up with.\n\nExample, I am pushing my child on the swing.  I pulled the swings of the child doesn't get to swing.  I just hold the swing.  Eventually my child will look at me.  I will communicate. What do you want? What should I do? \n\nAnd if the kiddo isn't at the level of any sort of word attempt, then even just them looking at me and acknowledging me then I will say something like \"let's go?\" Then let go.  And if they do any sort of a sound or anything like that then acknowledge it as a response and praise it as such.  I'm using them looking at me as their form of communication.  And then build on that.\n\nAlso, if you're in the United States, the child would qualify for early intervention services at that age.  That would likely be quicker to be seen by somebody, They would do an evaluation and let you know what they think.  And if they with your child's doctor, great.  But they also can provide more exercises and information on things that would help foster language.\nOftentimes they also might have some sort of play group.\n\nEdit* not to assume you're not doing activities that like that already .

Teaching your child how to communicate in his own is the best thing you can do for him.\n\nI work with kids teaching them how to do that kinda thing, sometimes sign language, sometimes PECS or a similar electronic system where they can choose an icon to show what they need or want. It makes a huge difference. I have seen kids go from having multiple meltdowns a day because they didn\u2019t know how to ask for something and it can be hard to figure out what they want and escalate their emotions trying to figure it out, to having barely any and being able to work through frustration more easily because they can communicate.\n\nShe has no idea what she is talking about and what she thinks would actively be harmful to your child and cause him more stress.
