People prioritize cleanliness and orderlyness differently.  I might agree it's weaponized incompetence if the husband was upset at the dishes not being done or the laundry.  It really sounds like he doesn't care too much about any of that.  It's not a high ranking priority for him.  However it is for OP.  She needs/wants things to be orderly and given her reaction to the slightest pressure challenging her mental ordering of things.  I suspect her house is in tip top shape all the time. So leaving a glass in the sink is a no go for her.  It bothers her.  \n\nNow having lived with many different people in my life, from my incredibly anal father who would pay a cleaner every 2 weeks to clean a house, that by all accounts was already clean.  To a college roommate who just thought leaving the ketchup out for days was cool beans. \n\n People vary greatly in how clean/neat/organized they need their environment to be.   This is something people sharing a space need to negotiate with one another.  If you want it cleaner than the other person does, you're going to have to do more cleaning.  They also are going to have to clean more than they otherwise would.  That's what a healthy compromise that accounts for all people's feelings looks like.  \n\nOp wasn't all that bothered with the relationship dynamic her and her husband have.  She was sharing a \"problem\" to be relatable and vulnerable with close family. Not one that actually bothered her.  \n\n This weaponized incompetence argument strikes me as people who think the world has to be the way they want it, and their partner has to facilitate that for them or they're a manipulator.  Idk it looks like some projection to me.  I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but if you're seeing manipulation everywhere you look in the world, it might be time to look in the mirror.", "I mean poly is fine but all 3+ people need to be doing an equal share of chores", "I mean would be explain why OP's wife so upset about weaponized incompetence.

The issue with people throwing these words around is it invalidates people with true issues and unless you are a mental health professional and you\u2019re treating the person you have no business throwing these terms around because you can\u2019t tell if someone\u2019s a true narcissist from a 3 paragraph post. It\u2019s impossible not only that but narcissism true narcissism is actually an extremely rare thing to be diagnosed with and it\u2019s way higher in men than women. Yet go on over to jnmil and 99% of the OPs call their MILS narcissists when they have neither the expertise nor degrees to be diagnosing anyone with mental health disorders.
