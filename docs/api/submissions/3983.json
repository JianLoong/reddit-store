And everyone did enjoy and laugh at my story except my sister who instead scoffed and rolled her eyes very purposefully.\n\nShe then proceeded to tell me that my husband was being purposefully incompetent in order to get out of doing chores. She explained that her husband knows how to do the dishes and the laundry and said that men who \"didn't know\" or were \"bad\" were purposefully doing so to manipulate their wives into doing it instead and to not ask them to in the future. It was all very weird and out of nowhere.\n\nThe other women around us were visibly uncomfortable by my sisters out burst and I was pretty pissed by her very disrespectful statement. I told her she was rude and out of line to talk about my husband that way and that it was none of her business, but my sister refused to back down on her stance. She said she only said it because she loves me and she wants me and all the other women in our family to want \"better\" for themselves and that it was her business since I decided to tell the story that started the whole thing.\n\nAt that point I told her she was being extremely toxic and ruining Thanksgiving for everyone else. My sister looked shocked that I wasn't agreeing with her points and ended up leaving pretty soon after.

Knowing how to do dishes/laundry/household chores in general isn\u2019t rocket science. I say this as a 37 M. Your husband most likely lived on his own before meeting you and did these tasks himself, so he knows how to. He\u2019s just choosing not to by making the lame, uninspired excuse of \u201cI don\u2019t know how to\u2026\u201d Not sure about you but I\u2019d have more respect for the man if he just said sorry no I\u2019m lazy or no I don\u2019t want to do it. However you should also tell your husband to stop being lazy and help out. I\u2019m sure he provides well in other ways for you and your family, but the onus shouldn\u2019t be all on you to take care of these types of things \u2014 marriage is a partnership after all. Also mentioning what you did opens you (your husband specifically) up for criticism. So if you didn\u2019t want or need any feedback you shouldn\u2019t have brought it up to begin with \u2014 even if it was intended as a \u201cjoke.\u201d I think your sister made some valid points, perhaps her delivery was wrong, but she\u2019s not the asshole. She was most likely coming from a place of love. You two should sit down and talk it out", "YTA Your sister is not the problem, so I'm baffled that you called her toxic.

I'd be embarrassed for you.", "This is a hard one as I\u2019d be saying same thing in my head that your sister said out loud\u2026 can also guarantee behind your back the other women are also saying it too.

What do they get out of it? You do the task, and they're free. This is manipulation, whether conscious or not, and it isn't a fair partnership at all and your husband doesn't respect you or your time and energy.\n\nAnd yes you say it as a joke, and women laugh because it's \"relatable\" but doesn't it hurt that you can't trust your husband with basic tasks like laundry and the dishes?

If there\u2019s any toxicity it\u2019s you and your husband. He\u2019s not performing surgery, it\u2019s dishes and laundry. Children can do both. Why can\u2019t he? You\u2019ve been conned. \n\nYour husband is disrespectful and inconsiderate. Also, you\u2019re the one causing drama and it\u2019s a shame your family members are too afraid of your next outburst/tantrum to tell you so. Sis definitely struck a nerve.
