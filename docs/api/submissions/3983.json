She needs/wants things to be orderly and given her reaction to the slightest pressure challenging her mental ordering of things.  I suspect her house is in tip top shape all the time. So leaving a glass in the sink is a no go for her.  It bothers her.  \n\nNow having lived with many different people in my life, from my incredibly anal father who would pay a cleaner every 2 weeks to clean a house, that by all accounts was already clean.  To a college roommate who just thought leaving the ketchup out for days was cool beans. \n\n People vary greatly in how clean/neat/organized they need their environment to be.   This is something people sharing a space need to negotiate with one another.  If you want it cleaner than the other person does, you're going to have to do more cleaning.  They also are going to have to clean more than they otherwise would.  That's what a healthy compromise that accounts for all people's feelings looks like.  \n\nOp wasn't all that bothered with the relationship dynamic her and her husband have.  She was sharing a \"problem\" to be relatable and vulnerable with close family. Not one that actually bothered her.  \n\n This weaponized incompetence argument strikes me as people who think the world has to be the way they want it, and their partner has to facilitate that for them or they're a manipulator.  Idk it looks like some projection to me.  I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but if you're seeing manipulation everywhere you look in the world, it might be time to look in the mirror.", "I mean poly is fine but all 3+ people need to be doing an equal share of chores", "I mean would be explain why OP's wife so upset about weaponized incompetence.

This was GI Day, usually on a Sunday so we started the week with a clean home.  Inter my future husband.  He was there with bells on.  I explained he did not live here, it wasn't his job to clean our home. No no no no no no.  He wanted to help.  And I had expressed how I expected ANY man I married to be a complete  partner and help with chores. \"Yep, I'm the boy!\"  We had to teach him how to sweep, mop, wash dishes, dust, etc, 'cause his family had a maid that did that.  But he learned. We agreed I'd cook and do laundry, he'd do the dishes and every Sunday would be GI Day.  And we married.  And his help came to a screeching stop.\n     So, I put away all except two each of the dishes so he could not dirty every dish in the house.   If his meal dishes were not washed by dinner next day, i did not cook for him. I stopped washing his clothes.   No doing your chores, no getting sex.  He tattled to his mommy, who explained things to me.  Men married for sex, to have someone cook and clean for them.  Why marry, if he has to help do household chores for himself?  Why not just have a mistress? Says the woman with the live-in-maid.  Why indeed?  \n   So I told him I would rather NOT be his wife.  He can move back in with mommy, daddy, and the maid.  He threw the Bible at me, and I threw it back.  Eve was Adam's help meet, not help mate, not slave.  I am not his property.  He can put on his big boy underroos, man up, keep his word, go get couples counseling.  Or we can divorce.\n    He washes his dishes, does his own laundry, helps with the housework.  Some of my family think that is just awful.   Is mother is livid.  But if he wants to live with me, he will keep his word.", "I\u2019m still stuck on \u201cmy wife accused my husband\u201d.", "YTA! YTA! YTA!  So many times and ways.  First, YTA for letting your husband weaponize his incompetency so you are forced to do the chores OR YTA for being so anal about how they get done that he has given up on trying to help you and just states he doesn't know how, because he doesn't, when it comes to YOUR way of doing things.  Secondly, YTA for bring up this \"funny, antidotal\" story that puts your husband as a goon, as a reader I never saw the actual story/antedote that you were talking about so if it was that funny and relatable maybe include that.  Thirdly, YTA for decided to speak for everyone.  WTH?!  You can state that your sister is being extremely toxic and ruining Thanksgiving for YOU! but you don't get to state that for the group.  I'm not surprised that your family was split down the middle on the situation because whereas they know your sister is outspoken and accept and expect her to speak up, they didn't expect you to be so outdated and clueless and overreaching.  Maybe there are a few female family members that would genuinely have found your little story amusing, but my guess is that most wouldn't (genuinely laughed with you that is).", "YTA. The truth hurts and your husband is brilliant.", "I mean your sister isn\u2019t wrong. If he lived alone he would have to learn how to do those chores but instead oops hehehe poor manz can\u2019t do it so wide work. \n\nYTA", "Your sister sees something you don\u2019t\u2026 I am the wife in your position and my sister speaks up about how incompetent my husband is. She\u2019s telling you straight up how it is .", "ESH at least based on your account of what happened and what was said. First, your sister is right, it is weaponized incompetence. However, her comment about how others need to better themselves is pretty condescending. She could\u2019ve let it go after saying it once, but she\u2019s not wrong. You, OP, suck the most though. You\u2019re perpetuating really tired gender stereotypes by passing your husband\u2019s \u201cinability\u201d to do basic tasks as \u201chaha funny\u201d which kind of reads as code for \u201ccute because he\u2019s a man\u201d. You could also have moved on and changed the topic of ruining the party was your concern.", "INFO whose wife? Are you poly? Just curious about what chores your wife does.", "This is a tough one between YTA and ESH.  If you know your sister is outspoken and not going to tolerate gender based jokes, that do get such responses from people for the reason that it is often true, then you should have held back or be prepared with a comeback.  I don't find her comment that toxic and surely everyone is used to this sort of conversation wrangling by now.  I get that you were just trying for a laugh and succeeded, but there is often someone who wants to stir the pot in the other direction.", "YTA. It was made her business when you shared with everyone. What your sister said is EXACTLY what your husband is doing. You can be okay with it, but don\u2019t be mad at her for calling it what it is.", "Your sister is right, but I feel like she could have delivered her message without insulting anyone. Yes, I know your husband is being an AH here if he just leaves all the chores for you to do, but that's a decision that YOU made because you didn't stand up for yourself, she shouldn't have pointed out your husband like that because that's what you do when you don't mind other people's business.\n\nSo yeah, I think the sister is a soft AH only for that, but she is right.", "Sister\u2019s husband the AH for spilling the beans to a woman.\n\nAnd OP, YTA for assuming all men are incompetent and laughing about it.", "YTA anyone who disagrees with your funny anecdote that wasn't funny is now toxic? Maybe she doesn't find willfully incompetent men funny and the fluff of sis joking about it was too cringe. Wow your family sounds a lot like mine. Not allowed to have an opinion unless it's popular with the group. Can already tell you nor the rest of the family is very deep. Only the sis. Shallow family.", "YTA and she\u2019s right. She shouldn\u2019t have to keep her opinion to herself because the reality of the dynamics of your relationship make you uncomfortable. It\u2019s not funny that men become incompetent the moment they get married because now wife can serve him, and laughing about how silly and helpless men are only perpetuates this actually toxic dynamic. It\u2019s a disservice to you, to every other woman there who could relate, and to their/your daughters.", "I\u2019m sorry, maybe you can explain what\u2019s funny about a grown man not being able to do things 10 year olds can do? As a woman, I\u2019m so sick of women acting like this is normal, acceptable, or funny. Good one, you have to do your entire household\u2019s labor! Lol!", "YTA. It\u2019s very odd that you continually refer to your sister sharing her opinion as \u201coutbursts.\u201d The misogyny is coming from inside of the house. Also, your sister is right. This isn\u2019t the 1960s anymore. People don\u2019t think the incompetent husband trope is cute anymore. The jig is up.", "YTA. You told her it was none of her business but you're the one who brought it up! Why can she not comment when you introduced the topic? Just because she has a different opinion from you doesn't make her toxic. You completely overreacted. Maybe next time don't joke about your husband's faults if you don't want someone to acknowledge those faults.\n\nTimes are changing and not everyone is happy to sit by and accept stereotypical gender roles and the disproportionate share of household and childcare tasks being put on women.", "YTA because one, your sister is correct, but also sounds to me like it hit too close to home? She was just sharing her opinion and refused to change it, and it sounds like you're the one who pushed it into a fight? Also she's right again because how is it \"none of her business,\" when you're the one who thought it would be funny and relatable to admit your husband is useless, and she simply pointed out that it's not funny and he is able to do better. \nYou could have attempted to change the subject but instead started straight up insulting her... once again, YTA.", "YTA\n\nYour sister is right.  Dishes and laundry are not hard to do.  If you claim to be bad at them, or act like you are, you're lying to get out of doing them.  The whole \"men can't do housework because they're bad at it\" trope is old and used up.  Men can do these things.", "YTA. It\u2019s weird you take no issue with doing extra chores because your husband is somehow as a fully grown man incapable of performing extremely simple tasks or apparently even learning how to do these simple tasks, but your sister merely pointing out what he\u2019s doing is \u201ctoxic\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d. If you want to baby your husband, that\u2019s your choice, but it\u2019s not weird or rude for your sister to point out he\u2019s intentionally bad at chores he doesn\u2019t want to do so that you do them for him.", "So either your grown ass husband is an idiot who can do laundry dry or wash a dish, or purposefully (or not) doing a bad job because he knows you will pick up the slack. Why don't you want better for yourself \nYTA", "YTA - your sister isn't wrong, and she's trying to point something out to you.\n\nYour husband should be able to do anything he would need to do if he loved alone. If you don't mind the division of labor that's great, but if you get sick,  you can't even trust your husband to *wash a dish* right?\n\nYou deserve better than you are getting, and your sister is trying to help you see it.", "They way you word things is...interesting to me. She was \"extremely toxic\". Her \"outburst\". I don't think what you described her doing qualifies as those things.", "YTA, and either your husband\u2019s a moron or you\u2019re a patsy, no third option.\n\nIf he\u2019s really not competent to wash dishes I suggest you take him to a brain doctor. I can\u2019t imagine the shock for the medical community that a grown ass man cannot put soap on dishes and move his hand. \n\nYou got mad at your sister because she exposed how okay you are at being taken advantage of, and made you look stupid. But hey if the shoe fits\u2026", "YTA. Either it's weaponised incompetence, or you're married to someone so useless he can't handle the sort of basic tasks most people learn to do by their teens.\n\nTo put it another way: Why do you enjoy laughing at your husband's failures?", "Odd slip up, kind of reads like the OP is actually the incompetent husband", "One time I went to a friend\u2019s house and his mom had recently left for a business trip. She had left a prepared meal in the fridge for her husband for each meal that she\u2019d be gone and multiple pages of instructions for how to keep the household running. I asked my friend about it and he said his dad just didn\u2019t know how to do that stuff. This man is the top legal counsel for one of the biggest companies in the world and, apparently, would starve if left alone for a few days. Baffling.", "Not gonna lie, I love reading these \"But my poor partner can't possibly do basic household and self care tasks!\" to my kids just to see the looks of contempt on their faces. \n\n\"Are you kidding? *We* can do laundry and dishes and pack a lunch and cook a basic meal. I mean, they could just buy a box of mac and cheese and read the directions. Don't they have the Internet? There are videos on YouTube!\"\n\nFrom me and the little cheeses (Babybels? Chips off the old nachos?), YTA, OP.", "Is it really incompetence, or just not done like she want or not with the \"quality\" she expects? \n\nBecause most of the time it is not incompetence but just a big difference of expectations. \n\nFor example, when doing the laundry, you can expect every clothe to be ironed, of just some, or none. \nMaybe you want to do the laundry with the perfect setting for what the clothes are made of, or you can use a generic mode that is OK for most clothes. \n\nAnd it is not incompetence to not do it the way you want.", "And even if it wasn't necessary it was...still correct? \n\nAlso I can't think of a better place to bring it up. To a bunch of women who are likely suffering with willful ignorance. OP had a lot of quick hot feelings about her hubby being called out. It's easier to do the chores for him than to ensure he does them well. A lot of women get very snippy about this, though. They've already done the mental gymnastics of saying \"well he's a man lolz obviously that's why\" instead of getting to the root of it. He knows what a clean dish looks like. And laundry?? Seriously?? There's no thought to it. \n\nI'm a female and I do my laundry by throwing everything in, putting soap in, and pressing start. How could I fuck that up?\n\nYTA op", "I think she has the right to speak her mind, just not in front of everybody at Thanksgiving. The sister said a painful truth about OP mariage in front of everybody. Even if she is right, most people would have guest OP wouldn't have took well being told that she was manipulated by her husband in front of her family. She would have likely saw it as an humiliation, like a lot of abuse victims felt ashamed even if they aren't responsible for their situation.", "Boundaries too", "Ok really don't get the downvotes here. I'm saying we make sure to thank each other for things we do because we want both of us to feel the other appreciates what they do. What's wrong with that??", "I hate when people misuse boundaries in order to control what others do.", "And the word \"trauma\". Almost meaningless now.", "My SIL is a counselor in a middle school, and she's talked about how about half her job is explaining the difference between bullying and someone not liking you, or natural consequences of your actions to the kids just constantly.  She is so good and patient and tolerant I am always amazed she can sit there everyday and say things like \"No, Jane not wanting to come to your house is not bullying\" and \"If you want someone to sit next to you at lunch you need to shower sometimes Carl\".  Just over and over.  It so good we have gotten to the point where bullying is not tolerated, but apparently it opens the door to people who thinks it means 'People who have personally upset me'.", "Or  \u201c My body my choice\u201d  where someone wants to something really inappropriate to the occasion."]}
