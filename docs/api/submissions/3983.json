People prioritize cleanliness and orderlyness differently.  I might agree it's weaponized incompetence if the husband was upset at the dishes not being done or the laundry.  It really sounds like he doesn't care too much about any of that.  It's not a high ranking priority for him.  However it is for OP.  She needs/wants things to be orderly and given her reaction to the slightest pressure challenging her mental ordering of things.  I suspect her house is in tip top shape all the time. So leaving a glass in the sink is a no go for her.  It bothers her.  \n\nNow having lived with many different people in my life, from my incredibly anal father who would pay a cleaner every 2 weeks to clean a house, that by all accounts was already clean.  To a college roommate who just thought leaving the ketchup out for days was cool beans. \n\n People vary greatly in how clean/neat/organized they need their environment to be.   This is something people sharing a space need to negotiate with one another.  If you want it cleaner than the other person does, you're going to have to do more cleaning.  They also are going to have to clean more than they otherwise would.  That's what a healthy compromise that accounts for all people's feelings looks like.  \n\nOp wasn't all that bothered with the relationship dynamic her and her husband have.  She was sharing a \"problem\" to be relatable and vulnerable with close family. Not one that actually bothered her.  \n\n This weaponized incompetence argument strikes me as people who think the world has to be the way they want it, and their partner has to facilitate that for them or they're a manipulator.  Idk it looks like some projection to me.  I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but if you're seeing manipulation everywhere you look in the world, it might be time to look in the mirror.", "I mean poly is fine but all 3+ people need to be doing an equal share of chores", "I mean would be explain why OP's wife so upset about weaponized incompetence. She's having to do all the chores while OP's husband doesn't do any. Lol", "This a grown adult can figure out how to do simple tasks like laundry and dishes. Neither are hard. Your sister is right, your husband is being lazy at best or at worst purposefully doing it wrong so you will just do it instead of asking for his help. She wasn\u2019t being toxic\u2026", "Why he brings the penis of course, which, you know, is a very tiring job.", "Oh yes. I finally learned an easier way to fold fitted sheets. They have no power over me any more!", "Summarized nicely!", "Can I ask what chores he does and how they fail to meet your standards?", "It was friendly banter and said in jest.", "And how is it not sister's business if she literally brought it up in conversation with sister?", "This is such a terrible take that women have. I thank my wife for doing chores and she thanks me because we have mutual respect for each other. Compliments are a good thing and ever insinuating they aren't is absolutely asinine", "Dishes, sweeping insufficiently, lots of things. I run a cleaning company so my standards are very high. Bottom line is it really doesn't matter, as long as he's taking initiative and trying to contribute. The truth is he means well, and I wouldn't attack him because he does something differently than I do.\n\nI think people get way too bogged down in small annoyances and sabotage otherwise amazing relationships with so much projection and fighting.", "Voicing appreciation is nice for the relationship, but pitching in equally on chores is a requirement for running a household with someone. Genuine gratitude should be easy when you don\u2019t have to put gold stars on the chore chart for someone who would rather not be bothered to try to be a good household teammate.", "So weaponized incompetence and what you\u2019re describing aren\u2019t the same. Your standards are objectively higher than others so many women likely wouldn\u2019t meet them either. What people are referencing when they use that label are people (generally) men that make it so the job is not done or needs to be redone. Think dishes in the cabinet with food stuck to them or a floor that\u2019s still sticky after they mop. It is willful and a form of manipulation.", "Don't recall reading about the chore chart. That is so much hyperbole that this is a far cry from the original point"]}
