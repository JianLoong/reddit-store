She needs/wants things to be orderly and given her reaction to the slightest pressure challenging her mental ordering of things.  I suspect her house is in tip top shape all the time. So leaving a glass in the sink is a no go for her.  It bothers her.  \n\nNow having lived with many different people in my life, from my incredibly anal father who would pay a cleaner every 2 weeks to clean a house, that by all accounts was already clean.  To a college roommate who just thought leaving the ketchup out for days was cool beans. \n\n People vary greatly in how clean/neat/organized they need their environment to be.   This is something people sharing a space need to negotiate with one another.  If you want it cleaner than the other person does, you're going to have to do more cleaning.  They also are going to have to clean more than they otherwise would.  That's what a healthy compromise that accounts for all people's feelings looks like.  \n\nOp wasn't all that bothered with the relationship dynamic her and her husband have.  She was sharing a \"problem\" to be relatable and vulnerable with close family. Not one that actually bothered her.  \n\n This weaponized incompetence argument strikes me as people who think the world has to be the way they want it, and their partner has to facilitate that for them or they're a manipulator.  Idk it looks like some projection to me.  I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but if you're seeing manipulation everywhere you look in the world, it might be time to look in the mirror.", "I mean poly is fine but all 3+ people need to be doing an equal share of chores", "I mean would be explain why OP's wife so upset about weaponized incompetence.

If someone is bad at something and that partner pick up the slack when needed even if it isn't done well, it's just being bad but if that same person refuses to do something and does it worse than/incomplete when told that's weaponized incompetence. And it ok to have different dynamics as long as it works for you and the other person.", "Devil\u2019s advocate here: I mean he could be bad at loading the dishwasher.  Some people do need to be told where to put things especially if they didn\u2019t grow up with a dishwasher.  He should be able to learn, but his wife might not be willing to show him how.  Also, he could be bad at folding clothes.  Sometimes it is hard to learn to fold clothes a different way for everything to fit in certain drawers especially if you were taught to fold differently or taught to hang almost everything.  Some people don\u2019t have the ability to pay that close attention to detail because they have adhd.  That\u2019s when it\u2019s good to trade off chores. NTA", "That video is funny af. Thanks for sharing.", "Oh my gosh the end of that vid made me crack up! His face!", "My always did the household chores without problem. The full range like cleaning, cooking, laundry, grocery shopping, ironing, dishes, parenting. Literally everything. My dad would be 85 year old. He was not perfect but but he had never about toxic gender roles. My mom was amazing but she was the caretaker for my grandma in little village which was 20 minutes away from our town with bus and she was always late back. This was the former Czechoslovakia. Very unusual for his generation too.", "There\u2019s a great satirical account on social media called \u2018Man who has it all\u2019 that does exactly that.", "Tbh if the OP and the other women are fooled by these 'schemes' then we know who the morons are...", ">I can\u2019t trust hubs with laundry. He\u2019s color blind\n\nThere's a pretty obvious difference between \"i can't do the laundry bc i refuse to learn how\" and \"i can't do the laundry bc i literally can't tell the difference between some colours\". One is a reasonable excuse, the other is weaponised incompetence", "Plus she has both a husband and a wife. Not very 1950s of her.", "Perhaps he generously gave her his last name.... should be worth a couple of hours of work", "LOL Both my husband AND my wife are useless at washing up! What are the odds, guess I'll have to do the lot....", "I mean I think that if someone brings up a topic as an obvious joke, that's not an open invitation to discuss this topic in detail, especially if it's such a sensitive one.\n\nI call bs on the sisters \"I'm just saying this because I love you.\" if that was true she'd have brought it up in private or at least dropped it after OP asked her to.", "It is like when narcissists study information designed for their victims and try to do the narcissistic thing of inverting reality to play the victim. \"Context\", is important to discerning who the toxic person is. Or in this case, \"who the asshole is\".", "He doesn\u2019t need his wife to teach him anything.  The internet exists, and even IF someone hasn\u2019t made a YT video/blog post/whatever on the subject, experimentation is a thing.

I could theoretically follow a YouTube guide, or pay a mechanic to change the oil in our cars/ repair our lawnmower when it breaks down, but I don\u2019t, because she is great at that sort of thing.\n\nRecognizing you and your partner\u2019s strengths and weaknesses is an important part of a healthy relationship. Publicly mocking your partner for their weaknesses is not, that\u2019s just an AH move. Making it about gender just means she is twice as big of an AH.", ">It\u2019s not hard to read the damn tag to find out what temperature something should be washed at or whether it\u2019s ok to go in the dryer. \n\nIf that's all you think that's important then you are a joke. And also people do fuck that up hence why many people accidently shrink cotton. Or fuck up and put red in with whites. As not everyone separates colors. But way to go with simplifying shit. And again not everyone wants to iron and thus uses the damp wet rag work around that gets rid of most wrinkles. \n\nAny of these examples could earn her ire. Cause you don't know her tolerance. You might think you are good only for her to say it sucks.\n\n>Seemed to work it out quick-smart after I divorced him though.\n\nHow do you know? For instances most colors are fine. The only one to avoid mixing with white from my experience is red. And for delicates most men don't own anything that would constitute as delicate. At least the don't know if they do or not and will wash a delicate as any other and for the kost part would be just fine.\n\nWhat you see as incompetence is not actually incompetence just a difference in standards. If some is perceived as not causing harm most guys will just let it be. But someone with OCD might have issues with this. Or someone like you would. \n\nI was my own clothes and I can tell you the only time I use delicate is for my underarmor hear gear type shirts. But I also know that regular and heavy duty wouldn't damage it if it's done every once in a while. I also don't give a shit about mixing colors except for making sure red isn't involved with white as that is so far the only time I ever had red bleeding onto white and turning it light pink. \n\nThis isn't incompetence this is just my level of care and my cloths are clean and are not damaged or at least there is no perceived damaged. But I can easily see others having issue with this.", "Why is not an invitation to discuss a sexist joke? And that is what it basically boils down too. Doesn't matter that a woman is telling it. \n\nI would have acted a bit differently and ask her what is so amusing about to force her to explain the sexist joke, but OPs sister was more direct about it.\n\nOP brought up this topic and has to live with the reactions.", "It sounds like there were kids present, so sister did a good thing by calling out a sexist joke in front of them.

I\u2019m not sure if I would call it PPD now, but general depression can be a result of an earlier episode of PPD.

To me it sounds like this was the sister forcing help on OP. The sister is of course probably right, but if you are trying to help someone see they are being mistreated, forcing them to confront that isn't going to help.\n\nI'm looking at this from the point of view of someone trying to help and abuse victim. From what I know, forcing conflict like this almost always results in alienation from the people trying to help.", "But is that what the sister was doing? It doesn't sound like she framed it as \"you shouldn't make men out to be incapable of housework because it's reductive\", it sounds like she was trying to force OP to say that her husband was abusive, or purposefully negligent.

I was working 2 jobs, didn\u2019t see my family for the 48hrs from Wed morning until Friday morning, off Friday and then worked Sat. I had Easter so I\u2019m cleaning and decluttering the house and my mom asked if I was going to weed my garden (3\u2019x5\u2019) I told her it was so far down my list I probably wouldn\u2019t get to it.
