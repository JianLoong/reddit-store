For some background, when I was 13 I ended up getting into musicals. I spent hours watching and listening to various shows amongst different casts, including any film adaptations of them. I developed a real passion, which I only ended up having more time fore during lockdown. It was a great way to escape into something else when I was feeling lonely and closed off and it really helped me emotionally through the entire ordeal. Due to this, it\u2019s become a bit of a dream of mine to go to Broadway and see a show live. I\u2019ve seen some live regional theatre in my state, but I\u2019m in love with the idea of going to Broadway in person.\n\nWhen my grandmother (62F) asked me in my freshman year of high school what I would like for a graduation present, I asked her if it would be too much to ask for a short trip to NYC to see a Broadway show. She told me that if everything had calmed down by then, she would love to take me, saying I definitely deserve something big and that she would love to return to New York. (She went once years ago on a business trip). I got incredibly excited at that point and would talk about it on and off with my grandmother as the years went by. However, recently it seems like plans have changed.\n\nI was on the phone with my grandmother the other night and the trip came up. She asked me if I had been \u201csaving up for my ticket\u201d. I asked what she meant, because I thought with the trip being a gift that it meant my ticket would be paid for. She told me the trip IS a gift, but I need to pay my way. She said it wouldn\u2019t be fair for me to be paid for and my brother and cousins not to be. I asked why my brother and cousins would be coming, because the original plan was just me, her, and my mom. She said she\u2019s been inviting her other two daughters and their kids and that of course she\u2019s told my mom to invite my brother because she wants to take the trip as a family. I managed to get her off the topic and then we finished the phone call.\n\nI don\u2019t want my entire family to come. It would be too chaotic and impossible to organize any of them. Almost none of my mother\u2019s family is capable of being on time to things. I also don\u2019t want my little brother going because he\u2019s 12 and very loud and disruptive. He can hardly keep still and quiet in a movie theater, much less a Broadway show he wouldn\u2019t care anything about. This was also mainly about getting to have a trip with my mother and grandmother only because I live with my father and see his family more. I really don\u2019t want to go on the trip anymore, because I don\u2019t want it to be more than my mom and grandma, and I can\u2019t really afford to buy my ticket or hotel room. I don\u2019t have time for a job outside of school and extracurriculars and my dad won\u2019t let me get one. Would I be the asshole if I just said I don\u2019t want to go anymore?\n\nEdit: To clarify, the original number of people meant to be involved was 3 (me, mom, grandma) and she\u2019s now attempting to invite an additional 8 people (two aunts, their husbands, their combined 3 kids, my brother) and possibly more.\n\nEdit 2: Sorry I forgot to clarify. We have to fly. We live over a thousand miles from the state of NY. That\u2019s part of why I don\u2019t want so many people going, I know they wouldn\u2019t make it to the airport in time and it would cause issues before the trip even starts.", "created_utc": 1684338789, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13k5ogg/wibta_if_i_told_my_family_i_no_longer_want_my/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s unfortunate that the group expanded, but you would be a brat to cancel the trip on everyone because you don\u2019t want them there. You would also disappoint your grandmother. It\u2019s annoying she invited everyone but it might be one of her last hurrahs. Time to be a grown up. Shift your perspective and adapt. It can still be a great trip as long as you avoid a temper tantrum. You\u2019ll make a lasting memory with your family - many who you may not see all the time once you\u2019re grown.\n\nThe cost of the ticket to the show is probably over $100 each.\n\nEdit: having to pay for transportation is an issue.

If all that was made clear, or it was what she led you to believe, and she's just now changed the goalposts, you'd be justified in not wanting to go.\n\nYou could ask her who would be going to the Broadway show. If it was a family trip to New York, but only you, she and your mother went to the Broadway show, would that be a good compromise for you, if you were able to afford it?\n\nCould your mum and dad put the money together to pay for your share of the trip? Since you're under 18, I guess it would be their responsibility to pay your way, so it might be worth asking if they could contribute something.\n\nIt seems the best thing to do for now is to clarify things with your grandmother. Tell her you thought she was going to pay for at least you and her to go to New York, and that you're a little disappointed because you wanted it to be a bonding experience for you, her and your mum. \n\nNow that she's invited the whole family, you fear that you won't get to have that special experience that only the three of you would've shared and cherished. Tell her you wanted to make memories with her, not the whole family, and that you thought she knew that because you and she have been talking about it for years.\n\nAfter that, if she still insists in making it a big family thing, you have the option of going and making the best of it, or waiting a couple of years until you have the time and money to organise a trip for yourself and whoever else you want to invite.", "NTA you\u2019ll get to Broadway \ud83c\udfad In the meantime do some research on tickets there\u2019s no reason you need to just see one show.

You\u2019d never have fun with that group not even sure that many people could get tickets to one show and then what show? Just look forward to a day you go alone.

Learning to decline something expensive that won\u2019t be fun because of a bait and switch IS the adult thing to do.", "I completely disagree with you. Grandma high jacked the event. She didn't ask the OP if she wanted more family to attend. It's no longer a gift for the OP. Grandma can still plan a family trip but OP shouldn't be forced to pay for and go on the trip.", "OP isn't cancelling the trip for everyone. She doesn't want to go on what is now a big family trip, when originally it was just the three of them going, and the only reason grandmother isn't paying is because she says it wouldn't be fair on OP's cousins, who were not part of the plan until grandma moved the goalposts.
