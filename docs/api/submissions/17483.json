For some background, when I was 13 I ended up getting into musicals. I spent hours watching and listening to various shows amongst different casts, including any film adaptations of them. I developed a real passion, which I only ended up having more time fore during lockdown. It was a great way to escape into something else when I was feeling lonely and closed off and it really helped me emotionally through the entire ordeal. Due to this, it\u2019s become a bit of a dream of mine to go to Broadway and see a show live. I\u2019ve seen some live regional theatre in my state, but I\u2019m in love with the idea of going to Broadway in person.\n\nWhen my grandmother (62F) asked me in my freshman year of high school what I would like for a graduation present, I asked her if it would be too much to ask for a short trip to NYC to see a Broadway show. She told me that if everything had calmed down by then, she would love to take me, saying I definitely deserve something big and that she would love to return to New York. (She went once years ago on a business trip). I got incredibly excited at that point and would talk about it on and off with my grandmother as the years went by. However, recently it seems like plans have changed.\n\nI was on the phone with my grandmother the other night and the trip came up. She asked me if I had been \u201csaving up for my ticket\u201d. I asked what she meant, because I thought with the trip being a gift that it meant my ticket would be paid for. She told me the trip IS a gift, but I need to pay my way. She said it wouldn\u2019t be fair for me to be paid for and my brother and cousins not to be. I asked why my brother and cousins would be coming, because the original plan was just me, her, and my mom. She said she\u2019s been inviting her other two daughters and their kids and that of course she\u2019s told my mom to invite my brother because she wants to take the trip as a family. I managed to get her off the topic and then we finished the phone call.\n\nI don\u2019t want my entire family to come. It would be too chaotic and impossible to organize any of them. Almost none of my mother\u2019s family is capable of being on time to things. I also don\u2019t want my little brother going because he\u2019s 12 and very loud and disruptive. He can hardly keep still and quiet in a movie theater, much less a Broadway show he wouldn\u2019t care anything about. This was also mainly about getting to have a trip with my mother and grandmother only because I live with my father and see his family more. I really don\u2019t want to go on the trip anymore, because I don\u2019t want it to be more than my mom and grandma, and I can\u2019t really afford to buy my ticket or hotel room. I don\u2019t have time for a job outside of school and extracurriculars and my dad won\u2019t let me get one. Would I be the asshole if I just said I don\u2019t want to go anymore?\n\nEdit: To clarify, the original number of people meant to be involved was 3 (me, mom, grandma) and she\u2019s now attempting to invite an additional 8 people (two aunts, their husbands, their combined 3 kids, my brother) and possibly more.\n\nEdit 2: Sorry I forgot to clarify. We have to fly. We live over a thousand miles from the state of NY. That\u2019s part of why I don\u2019t want so many people going, I know they wouldn\u2019t make it to the airport in time and it would cause issues before the trip even starts.", "created_utc": 1684338789, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13k5ogg/wibta_if_i_told_my_family_i_no_longer_want_my/", "score": 1452, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Since you're under 18, I guess it would be their responsibility to pay your way, so it might be worth asking if they could contribute something.\n\nIt seems the best thing to do for now is to clarify things with your grandmother.

Even tell her you would rather plan another trip another time, and that you will even pay for it. Make plans.\nThen when it comes time to go, ask grandma if she saved up enough money to go.

I'm the same age as your grandma; I don't know what world she's living in, but in this one, making you pay your own way is absolutely *not* a gift, and she's delusional to call it one.

We can go another time after I've had a chance to save the money.\"\n\nCustomize that, of course. Basically, you will *never* have the money saved. You will never be able to take the trip - with her. But you should always talk about it with her in a light tone, with a slight note of regret in your voice. Do save money, of course. Just never have enough for the trip. You can vary it by saying things like \"I'm so busy with school and \\[ list extra curricular activities \\] this summer \\[fall, spring, whatever\\]!

My niece was way too little for a trip like that, and plus, my daughter was ignored whenever grandma's favorite, my niece, was around.\n\nI ended up crying on the phone with the AG store reservations agent trying to \"fix it\" for my mom. For real. And this lovely woman told me, \"you didn't do anything wrong. Your mom is way out of line. I'm not changing your reservation. Bring your girl's daddy and tell your mom she's uninvited.\" Then she added a spot for my son so we could all go, and upgraded our package. My best friend and her husband met us at the store and oohed and ahhed at the salon visit and went on my daughter's tour.\n\nA literal stranger taught me that when family loves you, really loves you, these special moments are the gift. Everybody likes to feel special at the milestones. It's not selfish, it's not wrong, and grandma is way out of line. If she wanted to plan an NYC trip for her three daughters and their families, she should have done that. \n\nIf I was your mom, I would tell your grandma to go scratch. I would beg borrow and steal to take just you and me to NYC and have a fabulous Broadway trip. I'd make it unbelievably special, and eat take out in the hotel late at night and wander the city for fun. I would make it a memory to celebrate you. \n\nSince your actual mom is MIA, tell grandma she can take her trip with your aunts since that's what is actually important to her. Graduate, go out in the world, and find people who want to celebrate you and your achievements, simply because they love you. Digital mom hugs if you'd like them.\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Congratulations! I'm proud of you. And also, definitely NTA.", "NTA, it sounded like a very sweet and special trip to begin with, that is now getting crowded and less about something just for you. I don't know how far into the planning this is, but I've gone to NYC with my family before, and we broke into smaller groups (some went to a show, some went to go shopping, etc). So maybe you can still go to the show with just your mom and grandma.", "I would go with NAH.  Normally poor form to decline a gift, but gifts don't usually have price tags or other strings attached, so a very easy exception to make here.\n\nThat being said, you may not get an alternate gift from her, and that's okay.  You definitely don't have to take an unplanned financial hit, but you don't have the right to make grandma CHANGE her gift.", "NTA. Said repeatedly but I'll do it again. If you have to pay for the trip, it is not a gift. If all these people are going then it is not your trip or gift, just a family trip. \nSorry, but grandma is an AH here for doing this. \n\nOP, save up your own money and go with a friend without the rest of these people. Enjoy Broadway and whatever shows you get to see.", "NTA\n\nJust say you can't afford the gift. End of story.", "So what part of the trip is the gift part? This is not what you asked for and it\u2019s not a gift. \nNTA", "NTA\n\n\"*Grandma, it looks like you and I were thinking of two different things. I never asked for a family trip to NYC; I do not want that. I asked to see a Broadway show. The trip I want is just you, me and Mom. If you'd like to plan a trip for just the three of us, let's talk about it. I'd be very excited. If you are determined to plan a family trip, that is your choice; but it is not my graduation gift.*\"", "Tell grandma you didn\u2019t realize you were going to have to pay because you thought it was a gift and can\u2019t afford it. Save up to go yourself. You\u2019re not the asshole, your grandma is for giving you this beautiful idea of what was to come and then ripping it away from you without a care for your feelings. I am so sorry. Hopefully grandma realizes her mistakes and makes amends by taking just you and your mom as intended, but don\u2019t hold your breath. Sounds like grandma has decided this will be a big family thing and not a special gift.", "NTA. It's not even the same trip anymore.", "NTA. It's not even a gift. How is it a gift of you gotta buy it yourself?", "NTA. How is it a graduation present if you have to pay for it?", "NTA, real-talk from a New Yorker tho, if you're paying for it anyway just do a solo trip. r/asknyc is a good resource for any questions you might have.", "NTA. How is it a gift when you pay for it? Also, I wouldn\u2019t want my first trip experience to be with a bunch of family. I\u2019d want to enjoy doing what I want to do. Don\u2019t feel bad, just decline.", "NTA.\n\nThis is no longer a graduation gift, it's now a family trip and you're expected to pay.\n\nAll those things you say aside why you don't want to go anymore (and they are all valid reasons), why is your mum not paying for you at the very least, if grandma doesn't? You think all your cousins pay for themselves? Or would their parents cover their costs? Because that's what parents normally do if they take their underaged kids on vacation. Is your brother paying for his own ticket?", "NTA refuse this crummy non-gift.", "\"The trip is a gift, but you have to pay for it.\" OP's Grandma, that is literally the opposite of a gift.", "My sociopathic brain \ud83e\udde0 is living for these reasonings \u2026.. muahahaha", "Ooooh, you\u2019re good!", "This! I don't see how this is in any way a gift!", "What exactly is grandma\u2019s gift? Grandma is not paying for transportation, not paying for show tickets, not paying for hotel room. What exactly is the gift that grandma is giving when OP is expected to pay for everything for herself? It is no longer a gift, it is a family vacation with each paying for it\u2019s own. \nAnd OP is not asking grandma to change her gift, she wants to decline going on the trip, which was supposed to be a gift but now is not.", "NTA - Did she explain how the trip is a gift, even though you have to pay your own way?", "Yes, seriously, if OP wants to skip it, there\u2019s the perfect excuse: she\u2019s 17, where the hell is she supposed to get the money for this? Done, problem solved.", "Yeah! What part of this is a gift? The fact that other people are going to be there to bog it down?", "And eating out would be a nightmare.", "Disappointing I know. If I were you I\u2019d look into touring Broadway productions that may come to larger cities near you. It\u2019s not necessarily the bright lights of NYC but definitely fun. Those aren\u2019t cheap either but cheaper than NYC.", "Considering how expensive it can be to get tickets to certain broadway shows, it seems unlikely that everyone invited has the money for plane tickets, hotel, food, and a show.  I have a sinking feeling that they\u2019ll wait until everyone is in NYC then suddenly mention that some excuse for why they can\u2019t go to a show like op wanted.  Nothing about this is a gift for op.  They just want to claim they gave him a gift while making him pay.  Just say you didn\u2019t realize you were expected to pay for your gift so you don\u2019t have the money.  When Christmas comes around ask grandma what what she wants this year and then ask her to send you the money for it so that you can pay for her gift", "Hey OP, don't know if this will help but do you have any older cousins or siblings? The reason I ask this is that I graduated class of 2020. My 2 older siblings got senior trips as their graduation gift from our parents. \n\nAs you know being class of 2020 I definitely couldn't do a senior trip so my parents gave me the money they would have spent on my senior trip to me instead to make it semi-fair considering the circumstances \n\nSo if your Grandma has given trips/ presents or a certain amount of money to other graduates in your family have gotten you should point that out to help \u201cpay your way\u201d", "And it will be a show picked by other people. Op will hear the other kids don\u2019t want to see that or the adults picked this for \u201ceveryone\u201d", "How would a junior be graduating this year\u2026", "The gift is obviously that OP is allowed to spend time in her grandmas and mums presence, while neither of them will have time for her. /s\n\nThey throw her crumbs and expect her to treat them as a marvelous cake.", "Right? There are shows appropriate for 12 year olds, but then it's not really going to be OP's choice, either.\n\nMore likely, they won't even end up going to a show.\n\nIt's pretty clear this isn't a gift for OP anymore. It's just an excuse for a family trip to NYC.", "I missed that. Bad. Bad llama.", "Please include the receipt...", "No. If she's going to nyc from Omaha, Lax, or Abq it's all under 400 round-trip. Now, it's clearly not first or business class, but when I glanced, even lax was under 200 round trip. Just fyi.", "Completely valid"]}
