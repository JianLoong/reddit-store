I didn\u2019t monitor her channel because it didn\u2019t really seem necessary. I recently watched her channel because I thought it be cute so see what she does in her day to day life. I found our children faces in almost all of her content. \n\nI told her straight up she needs to remove all of her content, she said that she knew I wouldn\u2019t agree but she doesn\u2019t think this is a big deal. I don\u2019t like children content, I feel like alot of the time when you see that children make profit they become less of your kids and more of a product and your interactions become more performative and I can see the same thing has happened in her because she posted a video of her getting our 2 yr old out of a tantrum and how she deals with it but how is your first instinct to record and hold a camera whilst our baby is crying. \n\nShe started crying saying that she built this up and this is her dream and deleting her content will ruin it and I said I simply don\u2019t give a fuck, if you don\u2019t delete it I will consider a divorce. I know a lot of people have children on there social media and I don\u2019t mind an Instagram or Facebook post but to make videos seem to intimate to share.\n\nShe told her friends and even hinted on her social media accounts that she has an over controlling and narcissistic husband that doesn\u2019t want her on social media, am currently being ridiculed by her friends. Am I being over controlling or narcissistic\u2026\u2026\n\nEdit - someone asked what kind of content. The content isn\u2019t really harmful just her feeding them and playing with them but the 2 types of videos I have problems with is her recording our children tantrums and our 2 yr old still doesn\u2019t like clothes, we are trying to get her to wear them more but our house can be hot so she is in diaper alot.

Going against you and doing this behind your back will not end well if you don\u2019t put your foot down.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nChildren are taken advantage of all the time by tiktok and influencers. Kids have no idea what social media is. They can't consent to being online forever.\n\nNot to mention the amount of weirdos out there. It's been proven that videos with kids get watched and saved more. Especially when they are in revealing clothing.\n\nProtect your kids.", "NTA. You are protecting your children, not controlling your wife. Like you said - her first priority is making a video of what she does as opposed to actually taking care of her children. Also, she said she knew you wouldn\u2019t agree to having the kids in the videos but did it anyway - in otherwords - she lied to your face. \n\nShe can cry all she wants about you \u201ccrushing her dreams,\u201d but before that, she intentionally deceived you, knowing that she had no intention of doing what she promised you she would do. \n\nNo, who is really being narcissistic\u2026", "NTA.\n\nThat kind of exploitative content is pretty gross to watch, NGL. Every single aspect of her parenthood is only a facade for the sake of putting it on the Internet. She's also including her kids in a life they may not even want -- what is she going to do *IF* she actually succeeds at becoming an influencer and her kids are recognized and hounded at school? \"Haha, hey Timmy, those were some pretty rad *Star Wars* sheets you pissed in when you were 4 -- my mom loved your mom's tips on getting stains out, though!\" \n\nPeople who put their kids all over everything are never careful enough. You made ONE request, and she dismissed it entirely. What she's doing is disrespectful and, quite frankly, could be dangerous. There are sick people out there and she's just turning your kids into easily identifiable targets.", "NTA. She can be a content creator without kids in the videos. There are plenty if things to do. She can still do mommy content without the kids--packing their lunches, how she gets ready, meal prep, just talking about how she handles discipline, etc. \n\nYou are the other parent and have a right to say no to them being in influencer content. \n\nAs for the question of are you generally narcissistic and controlling--I don't have enough info. How often do you threaten divorce? Are you controlling in other ways? It kinda sounds like this is bigger that AITA. Your wife might be struggling in her role as a mom if she's this latched onto being a \"mommy influencer.\" I would look into that.", "**NTA**\n\nBased on the whole \"narcissistic shade\" that is being thrown at you, it's clear she's been sucked into a whirlpool of social media. It's up to you to pull her out or give up.", "I'm with everyone else: NTA.\n\nBut serious curiosity: if OP were to divorce her, is there anything legally that could stop her from posting the children since she won't have OP there to potentially stop it? Sounds like she'll do it no matter what... so alarming.", "NTA you didn\u2019t pour cold water on her dreams. You simply asked her to abide by the agreement that you made. Shame on her.", "NTA, I suggest talking with a lawyer and screenshoting all the comments she has made. I don't get this mania of parents using their kids for content. How will those kids feel when they grow up and are known for the stupid shit they did when they were little.\n\nNot to mention that this opens the door to predators. She can have a mommy blog without her children being shown.", "NTA, she is exploiting your children for her own validation and when you caught her in it, she said she knew you wouldn't agree. But she did it anyways. The video with the tantrum would have been enough to shut the whole thing down. You are not the narcissist in this, if anyone it's her.. \"Oh poor me, I want to be internet famous and use my kids to get there, but my husband says I can't use my baby having a tantrum for views so I have to blast him to all my followers\"... gross.", "NTA, especially given all of the controversy with \"parent\" influencers right now. If she wants to post herself, that's fine- but she should've consulted you before posting your children", "Those Ryan\u2019s World parents make me sick. At least Ryan should be able to afford lots of therapy when he grows up.", "NTA. I gotta get off this sub. How is this even a discussion?", "NTA. You made it very clear how you felt in the beginning of her endeavor and she agreed- and then did whatever she wanted regardless. She lied, and did exactly what you were afraid she\u2019d do. That\u2019s not a partner, that\u2019s someone using your family for their own gain and profit. Any parent who blatantly ignores what the other parent wants for their kids is headed down a bad path, and frankly I wouldn\u2019t blame you for looking into separation. What will happen when your kids are old enough to understand that they\u2019re being used as content creators, and don\u2019t want to?? Are they getting a cut of the profits in a savings account? This is only going to grow into a much bigger problem.", "NTA\n\nI've seen plenty of mommytok videos without kids. If there are kids, I'm pretty sure they get asked first to participate in a video. \n\nAlso, despite tiktok and YouTube having guidelines that involves kids, it can be bypassed.", "NTA, children should not be on videos for obvious reasons.", "NTA and document everything you can - this is heading a very bad direction and your kids are going to need you.", "NTA. I can\u2019t stand people like this, influencers are also quite often bonkers with a lack of grip on reality in my opinion lol.", "NTA protect your kids. They can\u2019t consent to being unpaid actors.", "NTA. Like, first of all, she agreed to not put your children online. If she wanted to *that* was the time to discuss it. Instead she agreed she wouldn't then did it anyway, so the dishonesty alone is kinda fucked. Secondly you are ABSOLUTELY correct, it is fucked when people use their children that way and you are being a good parent by refusing to let it happen to your own children.\n\nPlenty of mommy vloggers make popular content that doesn't feature their children in the video, this is the responsible way to do it. And again, the biggest thing isn't just the disagreement in itself, but that she lied to you and then went behind your back. She's also lying to her friends, you don't want her off social media, you want her to stop exploiting your kids on social media.", "NTA 1000%!!! I feel so sorry for all those poor kids whose parents exploit them for (supposed) social media fame. They\u2019re too young to consent and the parents treat them like props for their channels.

The WORST.\n\nNTA.", "My ex wife and I agreed years ago\u2026no posts with pics of the kid on socials. Send what we want to share via w/family via text or link but we just don\u2019t put her out there like that. No regrets about doing that.", "NTA. She doesn't own your children, as a parent you have a say in whether they are publicly exposed in the way all children are on online content, or not. And you made it clear you don't authorize it. This is a two yeses vs one no situation, and you gave a no. \n\nYou're not controlling or narcissistic for not wanting your children used to \"fulfill her dreams\". \n\nShe's literally treating the children as props for her content, and dismissing you as a co-parent, then trying to leverage her social media platform to manipulate you into submission. All of this is divorce warranting, in my opinion.", "NTA. Protecting your kids should come first.", "NTA those children are too young to really understand the impact of their faces being plastered all over the internet. There are ways to parenting blog without featuring the faces of your too-young children. Menzennial and Mommacusses on tiktok are both great.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nPersonally I could not stand to be with anyone who wants to be a \"content creator\" with or without kids in the videos.\n\nWho does she think is watching videos of cute young kids.. because it sure as hell isn't other mommies.", "NTA. You are in the right here. You have equal right to say no to the kids being in her content.", "NTA. Save all her stuff that she has posted, move out, take the kids, and file for full custody. See if you can get a emergency order and get back in the home- making her leave. \n\nParents who use their children like this do not have their children\u2019s interests at heart. It\u2019s sick.\n\nAlso see if you can get a gag order on the divorce proceedings, prohibiting her from talking about you and the proceedings online.", "NTA. This should be your hill to die on. Adults using their kid's for money and fame are disgusting. She will eventually make them act and force them for each dopamine hit she gets with each view and each dollor made. \nI absolutly cannot watch such content.", "NTA.... you set a valid reasonable boundary and she knowingly and willingly violated it. The ball is now in your court. Who cares what her friends say.  If I was you I'd file an emergency custody order seeking sole temporary custody and compelling her to remove all content from social media depicting the children and start the divorce process. get her served with papers....then and only then, sit down with her to discuss what happens next. She has zero intention of honoring your boundary and is twisting the narrative to paint you the bad guy.\n\nNote that also in the emergency custody application, seek to impose a gag order on her preventing her from discussing the situation publicly or on social media and use the comments from her friends as evidence against her on that front.\n\nThere's plenty of instances of violence against children depicted online... you can easily get a psychologist to testify that it's dangerous and harmful. One girl in Florida who was featured on line nearly got \"SA'd\" and her dad shot and KIA'd the perp who was a complete stranger who just saw her on line!", ">she said that she knew I wouldn\u2019t agree but she doesn\u2019t think this is a big deal.\n\nOh. So... she lied, hide and went behind your back. Without any consideration of you.\n\n>She started crying saying that she built this up and this is her dream and deleting her content will ruin it\n\nAnd now HER feelings matter, but not yours.\n\n>she has an over controlling and narcissistic husband that doesn\u2019t want her on social media\n\n>Am I being over controlling or narcissistic\u2026\u2026\n\nNo you are not.

But we do care about \"mom\"influencers, because they, to feed their addiction, will use their children to get that high.

She lied, and lied specifically *because* she knew you\u2019d disapprove.  That\u2019s a betrayal of trust and not okay.  \n\nThat said, that you told her you don\u2019t give a fuck about her dreams and went straight to threatening divorce if she didn\u2019t take *all* of her content down, makes me understand a bit why she might have chosen to lie.  It doesn\u2019t justify what she did, but it\u2019s not showing you in a good light as a husband.  I get that you want to protect your kids, but this is a difference of opinion on lifestyle and values, it\u2019s not abuse.  You need to find a compromise here - maybe some things (like the tantrum) are off-limits, no filming in certain rooms of the house, no full names, etc.  \n\nIf you can\u2019t communicate like two adults who respect one another about this, you\u2019re going to end up with a judge making this decision - and however they rule, your kids lose out in that scenario.   How they see mom and dad treating each other every day is way, way more important than what random, highly curated snippets of their lives strangers see on YouTube.", "NTA but I do hold you accountable by not checking up on this sooner. How was she able to get this far without your knowing about it? You need to take some ownership about not knowing what is going on in your household.\n\nThere's nothing controlling or narcissistic about you wanting to preserve your children's innocence and their privacy. If your wife can't make it on her own merit/interests and has to drag your kids into this bizarro social media circus, it's already a failure. I'm with you that showing your kids having a meltdown and how you deal with it for views is sick and somewhat twisted.\n\nI feel like if she wants something to do so badly, get a job or a degree. Hell, work on becoming an actress or something. Don't make your kids part of public life until they're able to make this choice for themselves. I know that I might be downvoted to hell for this take, but I don't care. Kids need to be able to be kids without a damn camera on them for consumption from the masses. And yes, I also feel this way about 'child stars'.", "ESH, but she sucks worse.\n\nShe sucks for explicitly disregarding your valid and important wish that your children's faces do not appear on public social media without them being able to consent to that. I totally understand your fears and why you would want to protect their identities and also their right to choose how they interact with social media, because god only knows what dystopian privacy hellscape we will be in by the time they can consent. \n\nYou suck because \"you thought it would be cute to know what she does all day.\" I don't know your wife's ultimate motivation for creating mommy content or wanting to be an influencer.\n\nBUT, as someone who has been a person who works outside the home and then also a mother working inside the home, I wonder if it's possible that she's trying to be seen for the truly tiring, never-ending, and grueling/ unpaid/ underappreciated/ disrespected and ahem, often infantilized, LABOR THAT SHE DOES EVERY SINGLE DAY and have someone interact with that, validate that, see that she has valuable insights and skills that are worth sharing or learning from?\n\nIf you think it would be cute to know what she does with her day-to-day life, rather than being influenced by her youtube, you could be influenced by her IRL by asking her what her day-to-day life is like in, you know, a conversation.", "Can't she just edit the vids and blur them or would that not be sufficient? Just a middle ground maybe", "Unpopular opinion but ESH. you set a boundary, she agreed and then violated it which is wrong, but youre accusing her of a perspective of your children being cash cows without ANY evidence. So she filmed the methods of breaking a tantrum. So what? It takes 5 seconds to start a video and set the phone down, unless you cam tell me that 5 extra seconds of crying is life or death for your kid, I find it maybe cringy but not immoral. Her channel is about mommy topics and it sounds like she's offering tips to moms. \n\nI think you jumped the gun demanding dismantle or divorce. I'd say suspend the content for maybe a mo th or two and attend counseling. You're both wrong here. She lied. You went full blast and issued an ultimatum immediately. Neither of those things are healthy and I'd bet money there's something deeper going on here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
