He has ADHD, and is quite literally the least organised person you could imagine. When I say he is late for everything, I mean it. Hell, that boy would even be late to his own fckn birthday party. When we need to be somewhere or are meeting, I\u2019ll have to tell him he needs to be there 20-30 minutes earlier than the actual time. His folders for college are a complete mess, he doesn\u2019t file anything and around 2/3000 potentially important sheets and documents are just stored on the flier in the spare room of his house. I worry how he\u2019ll cope in the real world with bills and documents, etc.\n\nAnyway, it was my mothers wedding last weekend. He was at myn the night before but needed to go home in the morning to collect his suit. I told him to be at the venue for 11. No later, on the dot. Well, it had got to 11.30, and he\u2019d still not shown up. My mother was literally about to walk down the aisle, and several people were asking me where he was. Just imagine how embarrassing this was. I didn\u2019t receive a text from him, no communication or anything. He ended up arriving at around 11.50, and he\u2019d completely missed the marriage. \n\nAs you can imagine, I was absolutely raging at him on the inside, but all the family where greeting him and making a fuss of how tall he\u2019d gotten, etc, so I had to contain my anger and just smile on. No one else seemed to be bothered, which seriously irritated me. It\u2019s just selfish in my eyes. After the lunch and before the evening events, everyone had a bit of time in their hotel rooms. (Hotel was on site) \n\nWhen we got back up to that room, I screamed at him. I just yelled about how annoyed and upset I was that he couldn\u2019t even turn up on time to a day so important to me. Unsurprisingly, there was no justifiable reason for his late arrival, apparently he \u2018got distracted\u2019. \n\nHe also looked very hot in his outfit which irked me as I was less happy with how my dress and makeup turned out, and was smirking throughout this whole ordeal while lying on the bed seemingly unbothered, which really pissed me off and was the last straw. So, I said \u2018why can\u2019t you just be normal.\u2019 This is when his mood changed. He wasn\u2019t smirking now, he went all subdued and seemed upset. I regret saying this, it\u2019s not his fault he has ADHD, but he hurt my feelings by turning up late, so in that moment I wanted to hurt his. And I think I did. These last few days he\u2019s been downcast and toned down, not like his normal lively self at all. He hasn\u2019t spoken to me about the incident at all though, so I guess maybe he could be upset about something else? \n\nI spoke to Mom about the incident as it was her big day after all, and she said I overreacted massively and shouldn\u2019t have said what I did. She told me how she loves his ADHD and how it makes him unique, and now I feel terrible, but I also feel like my anger was justified as he needs to learn to respect people\u2019s time more, especially on an event so important.

You are clearly fed up, and allowed your anger to explode in an assaultive way (screaming at someone is a verbal/audio/emotional assault).\n\nHe doesn't seem to take you, or time, seriously, seemed to think it was no big deal he was late to an important event, possibly thought it was funny you were angry, and seems to rely on his ADHD as an excuse for not trying to do anything about it.\n\nI have struggled with chronic lateness my whole life and often wish for more grace and understanding from the world, but I also know I have to work on improving my ability to meet time expectations, and that there are some people who cannot deal with my lateness. But also, my lateness can be damaging/disrupting/upsetting to others, and it's important to take responsibility for the impact (and try to implement systems to help, even if they fall through frequently: effort counts).\n\nI don't agree with people here who seem to be giving him a free pass for his actions because of his neurodivergence. I also think your family, and people in this sub, may be subject to societal tendencies to give men more of a pass (on taking responsibility) than women typically get, and that may be where part of your frustration is coming from.\n\nBut if you can't deal with this type of situation anymore without yelling at him, break up, for him and for you.", "ESH. I was going to give you a pass until you made the comment \u201cwhy can\u2019t you just be normal?\u201d I understand why you were upset but that is a completely unacceptable thing to say in response and is disrespectful to neurodivergent folks. Do better. \n\nThat being said, as someone who also suffers from ADHD, it is absolutely not an excuse to be discourteous and irresponsible. He knew what time you expected him to be there. He just didn\u2019t care enough to make it a priority.\n\nEdit: spelling/grammar", "ESH. \n\nYou said a terrible thing and should not have screamed at your partner. \n\nI have ADHD and also understand PRIORITIZING- setting multiple alarms to remind me to get ready for plans, calendar alerts, confirming plans. It\u2019s not that deep- he needs to learn these skills and FAST before it ruins his relationships with others.", "ESH, you definitely shouldn\u2019t have said what you said, and he should\u2019ve been on time to a wedding. I feel like the other commenters have covered why OP is an asshole but I don\u2019t think enough people are considering that being late to a wedding is a massive dick move considering he has had time to work with his ADHD and find out ways to be to important events on time.", "ESH. You for the INCREDIBLY hurtful thing you said. And him for not managing his ADHD in order to be on time for this very special event.", "ESH.\n\n\"Why can't you be normal?\" is just such a brutally cruel thing to say. \n\nHe doesn't suck for having ADHD, and he doesn't suck for having difficulty with punctuality as a result of his ADHD.\n\nHe does suck for not apologizing to you.\n\nBut that said, many people with ADHD carry a lot of shame over the issues that their condition causes. They've spent their whole lives being yelled at for this or that thing they messed up. More yelling won't help.\n\nWhat will help is treatment and supports. Is he medicated? That can help a lot. For the timing issue, get him to download the Time Timer app. People with ADHD just have difficulty conceptualizing the passage of time, and the Time Timer does that work for you by showing the passage of time visually. And there are plenty of other technological solutions that can help with time and planning.\n\nFor other supports and hacks, check out ADDitude Magazine. To understand how his brain works, I recommend watching some YouTube lectures by Russell Barkley, who does a great job of explaining ADHD to people who don't have it.\n\nHe can also ask his school for supports. They may have people available to work with ADHD students who can help him organize things a bit better.\n\nHe can also look into getting an ADHD coach to help him come up with systems that work with his ADHD brain.\n\nHe is going to have some gaps in functionality, but the best way to deal with them is not to get angry, but to find technology and supportive systems to fill those gaps.", "info why was he smirking when you were upset? ESH", "He needs ADHD coaching", "Massive YTA. And I know you're 18 but good grief, please grow up.   \n\"Act normal\" is incredibly insulting. He IS acting normal. You're just bigoted about the way his normal works.  \n\n\nAnd if you know he needs to be told to arrive 20-30 minutes early as one of his coping strategies, why didn't you use that strategy this time? Oh, because you thought your feelings about an event overrode the literal developmental structure of his brain. That's not how any of this woks.  \n\n\nApologize, get help on being a less shitty partner, and for the love of the gods, whatever that bit is about you trying to look hot? Delete it. This isn't about how you look. It's about how poorly you treated your bf.", "\"He had no valid reason, he got distracted\" ugh I wish more people understood that the unfortunate reality of adhd is the validity of this \"excuse\".

Ahdh can have real consequences, that's why it's considered a disorder.", "Yes YTA 'why can't you just be normal' was way to far. You only said that to hurt him because you feel like he wasnt taking it serious. That isnt healthy. \n\nADHD is more complicated then people realise. Your bf is is young and still needs to learn to manage, if you can not have the patience for that do not be with him. \n\nYour feelings of frustration are absolutly justified but not the way you dealt with it.", "I\u2019m going to say Esh. Because people being late repeatedly if diagnosed with ADHD can still work on not being rude. I have a cousin with it and I advised she show up 45 minutes early so she isn\u2019t late. There are things that you can use to keep on track, like alarms and things. Dealing with her can definitely be frustrating. But talk it out instead of blowing up.", "I\u2019m not giving a judgement but wtf are these comments? Yeah OP utterly sucks for her comment, I have ADHD and I can\u2019t imagine how hurt I would be if my SO said that. But why is no one talking about the fact her boyfriend was almost an hour late, and then SMIRKED at her when she was upset?? Like wtf I don\u2019t blame her for losing her shit, that is so god damn disrespectful. And tells me that he\u2019s not ashamed by his lateness at all like some commenters are suggesting.", "As someone with ADHD, YTA. I would've said e s h had your mom also been upset. But the literal bride of the wedding you were at was not only not mad at your boyfriend, but was mad at you for how you responded. It sounds like you don't understand how frustrating it can be to live with ADHD and frankly, shouldn't be with someone like that if you can't handle it. \n\nAnd I'd like to say something about him laying on the bed and smirking. I do this a lot, or at least something very similar. I've had countless times where I'll start smiling at an inappropriate time because my mind has wondered (not by choice!) and is somewhere else, until I realize I shouldn't be smiling. If I had to take a guess, your boyfriend was doing something similar until you shouted \"why can't you just be normal?\" That's a low blow and I think you know it OP.", "ESH\n\nYou more than him, and here's why.\n\nYou say no one else was bothered and they all greeted him happily which 'irked' you. Why? Would you rather they screames at your boyfriend for being late in front of all the other guests? They were being polite and were just happy to meet him. It's worrying that you aren't happy about that.\n\nSecond, you're upset with him for looking better than you? Really? That's an insane amount of insecurity, especially if it gets you that upset. You need to work on that instead of taking it out on him.\n\nThird, act normal. Do I really have to explain this one? Probably the most insulting thing you can say to someone who's neurotypical and it's a massive, ableist remark.\n\nYou wanted hurt his feelings for hurting his. You're going to get a lot of flack for that but it's a completely human reaction. However, you need to learn to control it.\n\nFinally, you actually screamed at him. That is wrong on so many levels. No one deserves that. Learn to communicate properly because that not constructive and will only scare your partner into not wanting to communicate. It was completely in inappropriate.\n\nNow, your bf. I have a fianc\u00e9e with ADHD, she's never on time either. I get your frustration. It feels incredibly rude and disrespectful, and for an event like this, even more so. You need to have an actual conversation about how he will manage this. For me and my fianc\u00e9e, this can mean that I remind her when we need to leave in advance, or she sets alarns, or she gets ready half an hour before she thinks she needs to. He won't always be on time, he can't help that but if he's making the effort and on time 80% of the time, that's good. But he can't use ADHD as an excuse. In the real world, you can't just be late to everything. You have to learn to manage it, which he clearly isn't. Showing up to a wedding nearly an hour late is unacceptable and incredibly rude. He clearly doesn't have coping skills in place but he needs to learn, quickly.", "YTA and ableist to boot. You have NO IDEA how difficult it is living in a world that is not designed for you to be able to operate how you naturally operate. You can't \"learn\" how to not be ADHD. You can't \"learn\" how to not have symptoms of a disorder you have. Yes, you can try to manage them a bit better but it's not that simple and ADHD in particular is resistant to therapy where you could potentially learn those management strategies. Sooooo so much YTA for \"why can't you just be normal\", I bet he thinks that about himself multiple times a day. There is an immense amount of shame in living with something like ADHD and you've just confirmed to him that everyone else hates him and his brain as much as he does.", "Please seek therapy. You know why.", "YTA. He may have messed up by being late but the fact that he just laid there waiting for you to finish laying into him speaks volumes about the situation. Have you done something like this before? I can't help but wonder if that's the case. \n\nYour comment was way out of line, you likely just destroyed the relationship you claimed to care so much about. You were purposely cruel and mocked him for being neurodivergent, he's not been \"his lively self\" because you deeply hurt him.", "YTA. That was a very hurtful thing to say. He freaking as ADHD, yelling doesn't solve the problem. He just needs to find ways to manage it and make it work. He is still 18 as well, so probably going to improve and get better as he gets better and find appropriate ways to work with it. \n\nIf you are struggling so much to accept it, I don't see why continue being in the relationship. That's how he is. You can't force change him, by yelling or forcing control", "YTA. To be clear: you are not the TA for being frustrated, angry, or for expecting him to show up on time. You are TA for the way you chose to react to it and how you treated (and perhaps continue to treat) his ADHD symptoms.\n\nHe has ADHD and is young. From your description, it seems that he's only figured out a handful of life hacks for himself at this point. It takes time to figure those things out... and lateness can be one of the hardest things, especially with ADHD because it's often not just one thing tripping you up.\n\nFrom what you wrote, OP, you have ascribed malice (selfishness) to a symptom of ADHD, despite knowing he has ADHD *and* despite knowing that it causes issues with lateness.\n\nFurthermore, you said this:\n\n>I just yelled about how annoyed and upset I was that he couldn\u2019t even turn up on time to a day so important to me. Unsurprisingly, there was no justifiable reason for his late arrival, apparently he \u2018gotdistracted\u2019.\n\nThis is proof positive that you believe he *decided* to be late to an event important to you *on purpose*. I mean, the only other way to read this would be that you believe this symptom of his ADHD should essentially be cured when it comes to events that are important for you... which is nonsensical. You know how he has a disability, OP, yet you're specifically treating him like he *chose* to do this, rather than accepting that his ADHD tripped him up.\n\nHe doesn't have a \"justifiable reason\" by neurotypical standards. But neurotypical people don't understand what it is like to be sitting on the couch internally screaming at yourself GET UP! GET UP NOW! while being completely incapable of *actually getting up*. I need to get up now to get there early. To get there on time. To get there *at all*. And yet here I remain, because I *cannot* get up. (That's execuative dysfunction, btw.)\n\nHe did eff up by being late. 100%. His ADHD is not an excuse for that. You had every right to be angry about it and express disappointment in the fact that he was late. But you acted like he was late because he was selfish - like he did this to hurt you - when you know it's because of his ADHD.\n\nHe needs to figure out how to be on time. By all means, hold him accountable. But, OP, stop acting like his ADHD symptoms are personal insults to you. They are not, and behaving that way will likely only make the problem worse.", "YTA don't scream at your partner. You should feel rather terrible. Yeah it's annoying when people are late and he needs to figure out something that works for him. why didn't you message him while you were waiting? Or tell him to arrive earlier? Or go with him? Your mother wasn't upset, no one else was upset, why are you embarassed he was late all you say is oh he's running late but should be here soon. It happens to people all the time. You could have said I'm a bit disappointed you were late again. Or work with him on an alarm system or anything else. Yelling then telling him to act normal how you want was not okay.", "Ooft, this is tough.  \nI think clearly you know that what you said was a dick move.  \nBut I think you are completely justified in being angry and upset with him.  \n\n\nSo in the context YTA for saying \"Why can't you be normal\" specifically.  \nFor everything else, NTA.", "NAH he won't get better or change this is how he is and even with medicine it doesn't always get better.

Your BF's actions are more aligned with normal than yours were towards him.  When is losing complete self control, screaming at him not just bc of the lateness but because he looked better than you, considered normal? Hint, it's not. It's abusive, selfish, and a little too close to resembling a psychotic break.  At least his actions are defensible; yours are not.  \n\nFrom how he has been with you since your rage, it sounds like you probably destroyed your relationship. If so, it's a good thing.

He has ADHD, and is quite literally the least organised person you could imagine. When I say he is late for everything, I mean it. Hell, that boy would even be late to his own fckn birthday party. When we need to be somewhere or are meeting, I\u2019ll have to tell him he needs to be there 20-30 minutes earlier than the actual time. His folders for college are a complete mess, he doesn\u2019t file anything and around 2/3000 potentially important sheets and documents are just stored on the flier in the spare room of his house. I worry how he\u2019ll cope in the real world with bills and documents, etc.\n\nAnyway, it was my mothers wedding last weekend. He was at myn the night before but needed to go home in the morning to collect his suit. I told him to be at the venue for 11. No later, on the dot. Well, it had got to 11.30, and he\u2019d still not shown up. My mother was literally about to walk down the aisle, and several people were asking me where he was. Just imagine how embarrassing this was. I didn\u2019t receive a text from him, no communication or anything. He ended up arriving at around 11.50, and he\u2019d completely missed the marriage. \n\nAs you can imagine, I was absolutely raging at him on the inside, but all the family where greeting him and making a fuss of how tall he\u2019d gotten, etc, so I had to contain my anger and just smile on. No one else seemed to be bothered, which seriously irritated me. It\u2019s just selfish in my eyes. After the lunch and before the evening events, everyone had a bit of time in their hotel rooms. (Hotel was on site) \n\nWhen we got back up to that room, I screamed at him. I just yelled about how annoyed and upset I was that he couldn\u2019t even turn up on time to a day so important to me. Unsurprisingly, there was no justifiable reason for his late arrival, apparently he \u2018got distracted\u2019. \n\nHe also looked very hot in his outfit which irked me as I was less happy with how my dress and makeup turned out, and was smirking throughout this whole ordeal while lying on the bed seemingly unbothered, which really pissed me off and was the last straw. So, I said \u2018why can\u2019t you just be normal.\u2019 This is when his mood changed. He wasn\u2019t smirking now, he went all subdued and seemed upset. I regret saying this, it\u2019s not his fault he has ADHD, but he hurt my feelings by turning up late, so in that moment I wanted to hurt his. And I think I did. These last few days he\u2019s been downcast and toned down, not like his normal lively self at all. He hasn\u2019t spoken to me about the incident at all though, so I guess maybe he could be upset about something else? \n\nI spoke to Mom about the incident as it was her big day after all, and she said I overreacted massively and shouldn\u2019t have said what I did. She told me how she loves his ADHD and how it makes him unique, and now I feel terrible, but I also feel like my anger was justified as he needs to learn to respect people\u2019s time more, especially on an event so important.

Aside from all of the unpleasant physical symptoms, my mind was racing 100x more than it does now. I suffered from horrible insomnia, usually getting about 1-2 hours of sleep per night. I fell asleep in class every day. I even hallucinated a few times from lack of sleep. I missed so much school between appointments and complications from my illness that I almost had to repeat a year. I went from straight A\u2019s to failing most of my classes. I had psychotic episodes and regular panic attacks. I completely forgot how to play the piano. I sat on my bench and cried because I couldn\u2019t remember anything, even though I had practiced the day before. It never came back to me. I had to retake multiple exams due to not finishing either because I was too distracted or because I fell asleep during them. Ended up in the hospital too a few times due to life threatening complications. This was all while I should have been learning the skills needed to be a functional adult, but I was barely just getting by. However, I realized there are people who have it far worse than I do yet still manage to succeed. So what\u2019s stopping me? \n\nI finished university. I have a job. I pay my bills. I do my own taxes every year. I\u2019m far from perfect. My home office is a hot disaster\u2014 I\u2019m pretty sure my diploma is in a pile of random papers and garbage on the floor somewhere next to the cat litter box. I still can\u2019t keep a planner to save my life. I have to set alarms or write notes for myself on my phone to remember things.\n\nAt some point, you have to stop making excuses and be responsible. \n\nThis was his girlfriend\u2019s mother\u2019s wedding, so it was likely very important to her for him to attend.

That\u2019s not good enough. Additionally, he couldn\u2019t even be bothered to text his gf that he was going to be late.

With the help of my partner, our house is kept relatively minimalist and clutter free so I don't get distracted deep diving into random junk. Have to pack for a holiday?
