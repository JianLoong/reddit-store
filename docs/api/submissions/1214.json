While your bf\u2019s disappointment is not unreasonable, it also doesn\u2019t consider your circumstances being sick. Offer what support you can but staying home and not spreading illness is better for EVERYONE.", "NTA\n\n2 hours is a long way, I know he would appreciate your support but if you're really sick you should just recover and go visit when you feel better. And just call to check on him regularly", "NAH - It\u2019s understandable why you don\u2019t want to go, and why your boyfriend is disappointed. If you\u2019re up to it, I\u2019d suggest calling or texting to check up on him until you\u2019re able to visit", "He's sad and he wants a hug. He can't hug facetime. I'm confused about how sick you are - you describe yourself as sick, but also don't seem to be staying home in bed. But if you're too sick to be there for your bf, you're too sick.\n\nNAH"]}
