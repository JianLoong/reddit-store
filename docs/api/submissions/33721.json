After discussing he suggested skinny dipping, which might be an unpopular opinion of mine but I feel like that's too much for a first date but idk. \n\nI told him I would be down to go to a beach or pool but skinny dipping wasn't my style (at least not yet). \n\nHe told me that was fine, and he recommended a local beach that was pretty good distance for both of us. And we planned on bringing some snacks and other stuff that would make it more fun. One key thing is that he said he would buy me a swim trunk since I told him I didn't have one atm. I thought it was a nice gesture so I said it was ok. \n\nWe met on the chosen day, and to our lock it was actually rather warm and not too crowded, mostly because it was on a school day. \n\nWe each parked near the beach in our separate cars, with each bringing some items like towels, and he even brought a cooler with some sodas which was nice of him. \n\nHe gave me the swim trunks which were alittle too loose but once I tighten them they were better, and we chose a nice spot to set up everything. After a bit of talking and drinking, we decided to race into the water. \n\nWe both entered and it was cold, and we kept moving deeper into the waves. That's when I noticed my trunks were feeling weird, but I didn't think about it.\n\nAs we got even deeper, I noticed parts of my trunks peeling off in the water, and got worried something was biting it off. \n\nI began swimming back, and more chunks of it were coming off until I was left with only the string around me. \n\nI asked him what was wrong with the trunks, and he told me that he thought it would be funny if they dissolved. I was so mad, that I just decided then and there to just leave. \n\nLuckily there wasn't much people that saw me come out naked besides an older couple that just stared at me weirdly. I just put on my clothes that were on my towel and left to my car without telling him anything. \n\nHe texted and called me repeatedly but I haven't answered him since.

(2) Might be the asshole because I refused to stay on the date, or refused to give him a second chance. And refused to listen to him or respond to him since.

Also, you were at a public beach. I don't know if he thought it'd be ok to do that since there weren't many people around, but how could he know the beach would be as empty as it was? If y'all had been together for awhile and pranks like that were the norm, and if it happened somewhere that was a little more private, I'd say no harm, no foul. That's not what happened here.
