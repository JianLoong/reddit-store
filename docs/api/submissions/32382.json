I am a second year engineering student and my brother is a high school graduate who doesn\u2019t work. In my family there is a sort of golden child dynamic where my brother is the GC and I am sort of the scapegoat.\n\n  \nThere is some backstory to my post. A few years ago my maternal grandmother was getting too old to stay and live on her own so she moved to an apartment near our house. The idea was that our family could care for her with her close by. In reality, it was really just me going and caring for her, helping with the chores and yard work, keeping her company when I had breaks, organising her final affairs etc. I loved my grandma but eventually she passed away peacefully a few months ago. \n\n  \nMy grandma was really sad with how my family treated me and supported me while I was caring for her. She talked about how her family didn\u2019t really care about her and how she had to fight to get where she was in life back when women weren\u2019t really regarded as fully independent people in society. She was the one who really encouraged my goals to go into science because she was a chemist and saw that I had aptitude in science. \n\n  \nDuring her funeral, my brother and some of our cousins were making jokes and being really insensitive towards her. But when the will was read out and we all learnt that she had given me close to $300,000 they got really angry with me. The rest of the family didn\u2019t get as much as me and they started asking me to cut them in via the family group chat. My parents started pressuring me to use that money to help them and our brother.\n\n  \nMy grandma had also left me a letter where she told me to use that money to get a headstart in life and that she was very thankful that I took good care of her during her last years on earth.   \nWhen I received the money I put it all away into long term stable investments but I kept a little bit of it to splurge on a new laptop for my studies. Since my studies requires some intensive graphics, the laptop I bought was rather expensive (but not over the top). \n\n  \nMy brother and my parents are now pressuring me to give the laptop to him because he wants to use it to game with his friends and that I don\u2019t need such an expensive or powerful toy. I am refusing to do so because its for my studies and it is technically my laptop. My parents say it\u2019s a family laptop and that she gave the money to the family (she didn\u2019t). \n\n  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701758325, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18b5yfq/aita_for_not_letting_my_brother_use_the_family/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Does your university have campus accomodation you could just continue to stay in over the holidays?", "NTA. You need to move out ASAP.", "NTA. Try to move out asap. They won't change, but once you're out, at least it would be easier to block them, and you won't have to deal with that stress.", "Absolutely NTA, which I think you know. Don\u2019t give in. If necessary, move to a dorm and use some of your money to pay for it. Make it v clear to your parents that the money was left to YOU.", "I have been thinking about moving out tbh. He already has a nice PC its just that he always seems to want what I have. He stole my laptop a few months back when his PC was out of commission and left it in really bad condition with lots of food crumbs and didn't even bother hiding the gross shit he watched on it.\n\nIt's just really tiring living with them so yeah, looks like I'm going to be searching for a way to move out", "100% this. Move out and begin your life out from under their shadow. You deserve better than this! NTA!", "They keep telling me that I shouldn't be going into engineering and that I'm not cut out for it so the laptop is a waste", "I would definitely recommend moving out; rent a small but nice apartment close to your campus and don\u2019t give them any keys. The sense of freedom you\u2019re going to get from this will be immense. Once you\u2019ve graduated you\u2019ll be able to look for a job wherever you want and buy a property wherever that is, thanks to your grandmother. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, by the way \u2014 for your sake I wish she was still around so that you\u2019d have some nicer family members, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve got your grandmother\u2019s hand giving you a helping hand up and out!", "NTA, get yourself out of this toxic house as soon as you can. Don't tell them of your plans either or they'll try to stop you. Meanwhile put a password on your laptop so your brother can't use it.", "And you shouldn't listen to them. They sound toxic and entitled at best. Have you considered moving out? I know handling school and being out on your own can be difficult, but clearly being in a home you don't seem to be valued in from my perspective is also quite difficult\n\nI'm sorry that your family seems to want to put you down and take advantage of you", "Yep, definitely the scapegoat. The golden child doesn't need the laptop either, so it would be a 'waste' for him too.\n\nTell them you plan on using the laptop to game, and admire the mental gymnastics they go through to justify your brother's gaming but not yours. Then move out!", "NTA\n\nThey are doing and saying anything they can to bleed you dry. They are parasites. They are lying because the truth doesn\u2019t benefit them.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t cut out for engineering and the laptop was a waste, you could just sell the laptop and get your money back and use it for something else for yourself, but that\u2019s not what they\u2019re telling you to do. They\u2019re telling you to give it to them. They\u2019re saying that anything you have is actually the family\u2019s property, not yours, but their actions show that they know that the only way they\u2019ll get anything is if you give it to them.\n\nThey aren\u2019t entitled to your property or your money. They are just trying to get you into the mindset where you feel like you don\u2019t deserve anything and so give it to them instead.\n\nThey\u2019re showing that they will lie and inflict pain on you if it benefits them. Do you want to continue having a relationship with them at all?\n\nYou have the money to live on your own. Since you\u2019re still studying you could rent somewhere small to start with, keeping costs low to start with so that the money will last a long time and you\u2019ll still have enough to buy your own place later down the line when you have stable employment and you know you won\u2019t be moving for a good long time. Given what you\u2019ve done with the money so far it sounds like you\u2019ll do fine.\n\nThink about if that sounds right for you.", "Why am I not making a shocked Pikachu face? They are totally unsupportive and seem pretty misogynistic too. Run!", "Come on, you know you're NTA. I would look i to laptop locks because I don't trust that a simple password would be enough to keep them from this laptop. Honestly, it might not be a bad idea to just buy your own house because they are never going to leave you alone about that money.", "NTA, you got a really good sum of money, i think the opportunity has presented itself for you to go your own path in life now.

Please get out of that environment. As your Grandma said, you deserve more. All your parents are doing is laying on the guilt, and entitling your lazy brother.\n\nGood luck in your studies.

Move out.", "NTA and tbh you need to get out ASAP. They will hound you and make you feel like shit because they feel entitled to your inheritance", "Move out, into your own place. Today.\n\nYou're NTA, your golden brother wants to play games on YOUR laptop and your parents take his side: move out, right away. Invest your money in your own space to live your life, I absolutely guarantee, if you stay your parents will take your laptop and give it to your brother.

I'm so sorry they did this to you. Your grandma sounds incredible.  My college didn't take women until the year before I was born - women in scientific endeavors were just so incredible back then for the hazing and lack of opportunities they endured.  You do not give into their bullying.", "You need to move out. You have the money to do so. Keep your laptop, credit cards, any personal documents in a safe or lockbox and away from them.

Leave these idiots behind and don't look back.", "NTA and you need to move out and in the meantime get a lock for your door or at the very least a lockable storage chest for your valuables.
