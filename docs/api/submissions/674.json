However real parents would not spring something like this on their children.

So assuming your brother is not under 10, it sounds like your parents do not trust you. And that means they failed as parents.\n\nGet out of that house as soon as you can. Fearing your own parents is never a good sign. It are the two people you should never have to fear, not even when you did something wrong."]}
