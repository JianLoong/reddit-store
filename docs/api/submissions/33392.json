I have been dating my boyfriend, Brad(25M), for two months now. Recently he invited me to go to a concert with him and his friends. Of the friends in this story there are Barbie(25?F), Ken(25M), and Allen(25?F). (Obviously all fake names, sorry I\u2019m not creative)\n\nNow Barbie and Allen were dating up until a few weeks ago, for about 5 years. Allen and Ken have been friends much longer, but they\u2019re all part of one large friend group.\n\nWe all met up at Brad\u2019s place ahead of the show, a bit of pregaming and getting to know each other, as this is my first time meeting any of them in person. Barbie is friendly, drunk, and overly touchy but overall nice. Ken is just a dude, a bit blas\u00e9 and moderately funny. As we move forward with chatting and getting to know eachother, Barbie is increasingly physical with Ken, until she\u2019s practically in his lap on the couch. Allen steps away to talk with Brad for a while, clearly upset by Barbie\u2019s blatant flirting with Ken. \n\nAt the concert, Barbie is even more drunk. At some point she needs air so she turns and whispers to Brad and then Brad tells me to go outside with her. While we\u2019re outside Barbie tells me about how she was mistreated by Allen during the relationship and just generally bad mouths him. She then proceeds to tell me that she and Ken are secretly dating. She insists that I do not tell Brad or Allen and explains how she is so glad she finally had someone to tell because she was dying to share her secret. \n\nI\u2019m uncomfortable with this. I don\u2019t like being told to lie to my new boyfriend by one of his closest friends, and I don\u2019t like that I\u2019ve been dragged into drama I was previously not a part of. \n\nAt some point later Brad needs some air and the first thing I say to him is that Barbie told me some things that she didn\u2019t want me to tell him and he has to promise not to give away the fact that I told him. I told him everything she said and basically confirmed his suspicions that Barbie and Ken were an item. \n\nLater on he expresses how he is bothered by the fact that Barbie not only asked me to lie to him but at the fact that she made me uncomfortable by doing so. He was still slightly upset about it the next morning. \n\nI want to build a friendly relationship with all of his friends and I feel like I\u2019ve already violated Barbie\u2019s trust. I feel like I\u2019m the asshole because I agreed not to tell and that was the first thing I did. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703020915, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mcwde/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_something_his/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was already obvious that her and Ken are a thing, she just confirmed it to you. Her asking you to hide a secret from your boyfriend would never have gone well. I'll be honest, I don't think I would want to be friends with a girl who would go after her ex's close friend OR friends with a guy who would date his friend's recent ex. That's too much drama for me. I'd just avoid hanging out with them until they figure all their drama out.", "NTA. \n\nNo one knows the universal rule: if you tell half the couple a secret the other half will find out inevitably. This is a rule of the universe.", "NTA. She didn't first ask if she could confide in you a secret you couldn't tell your boyfriend and decline hearing her secret.", "Im going with ESH. She shouldn't have told you or hid the relationship from the friend group. You're only slightly TA because you're the catalyst of a huge wave of drama and will fracture the friend group. 100% you're going to blamed and hated by Barbie, possibly ken. Some things are better left unsaid.", "depends. was that private thing suppose to be a secret and not ment to be shared with anyone?", "YTA but I think AH is too strong, it just seems to me like you could have chosen better -- the fact that she was dating Ken wasn't bad, it wasn't hurting anyone (though Allen would surely have been annoyed but that's his problem) and would come out within the group pretty soon anyway.  I can see why you wanted to share it with your bf -- it did mean you had reached a level of acceptance with someone in the group, and he'd find it interesting since it's his old group of friends -- but I think it may have been wiser to simply keep this one to yourself.  But really I'd say don't worry about it, let them work it out amongst themselves.  Hopefully your BF realizes it's not that big a deal, just a little drama.", "YTA. Sadly she thought you seemed like a trustworthy person that she could talk to, so you immediately turned around and showed her that you can\u2019t be trusted. Hopefully Brad takes note of this and never confides anything in you.", "I hate these kind of conversations. It's important enough to tell, if they're confronted the first thing they'll ask is who told. \n\nYou already betrayed their confidence, why do you care if they're mad at you?\n\nBarbie sounds like a bad person.", "YTA\n\nNot for telling your bf, if you didn\u2019t tell him I\u2019d also say YTA for that.\n\nBut don\u2019t make a promise if you don\u2019t know if you can keep it. If you meet someone for the first time and they ask you to keep a secret, just tell them it depends on the secret.", "Lmao degraasi", "YTA I mean yeah, someone told you not to say anything and you said something almost immediately. There was no moral dilemma, no cheating go on so who cares?", "NTA, why do people who can't even keep their own secrets, expect someone else to keep them for them.", "NTA no loyalty to barbie and Ken is breaking Bro code.", "This isn\u2019t a CW show where everyone has a right to know everyone\u2019s secrets.  \n\nBrad did not need to know Allen was a bad boyfriend or that Barbie and Ken had started booking up. He also didn\u2019t ask about it. I don\u2019t understand how that would make you a liar.\n\nSo you can\u2019t keep someone\u2019s confidence. \n\nYTA.", "This is it. Loyalty is to your man not the friends in this instance.", "Exactly this, you can\u2019t tell me something and then decide I have to take it to the grave", "She said something along the lines of \u201cokay can I tell you something?\u201d With the implication that it was clearly a secret but she never said \u201cbefore I tell you you have to promise not to tell Brad\u201d or anything as such", "No, Barbie and Ken are the catalysts. Not OP, who was put it an impossible position. It\u2019s not fair to blame her for \u201ca huge wave of drama\u201d she wasn\u2019t involved in", "She told me very specifically not to tell Brad or Allen", "And sometimes loyalty is just to people who are doing the right thing.", "NTA. Sounds like a drunk person being a baboon and unfairly putting you in a compromising position with no perfect action. I trust that Barbie's inebriation level is accurately portrayed. Regardless of her, and your, degree of intoxication, you were picking the lesser of evils forced upon you. *Someone* will have thought YTA no matter what, but you're NTA in the big picture because you stood by good judgement and morals. I think most will agree you're in an impossible position.\n\nYou caused drama, sure, but it was inevitable and no matter what you did there'd be drama. Best case, you'd have walked away (not realistic, and she'd just think you're mean when you just want to leave a good impression).", "I mean when I was really drunk once (20 years ago) my \"can I tell you something\" to someone was telling them a friend had a dumb haircut. \n\nSo I get not thinking it would be big lol", "That's why i said OP is a soft TA. She might not be the bomb but shes certainly the fuse that lit it. Yes she was put in an impossible situation but the fact she immediately told her BF is a bit dramatic. She should have talked to barbie sober and told she wasn't comfortable being involved and she could either tell the group or she was going to tell her boyfriend. Barbie wasn't exactly keeping it secret by flirting with ken when the ex could see.", "Exactly! Like shit girl, tell me what it's about first! Is it a bad haircut, somebody's cheating, you're dating your ex's friend, or did you freaking commit murder and you're making me an accomplice?!?!! \n\nSilver lining: people mature with time and do this stuff less often."]}
