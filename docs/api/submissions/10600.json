I\u2019ve been hesitant on going even though he\u2019s asked before because I\u2019m agnostic (he knows this btw) and I just felt like I wouldn\u2019t fit in with his church friends but this time I decided to go to make him happy and I hadn\u2019t seen him all week since we go to different schools. \n\nWe get there and after we got through singing for like 20 minutes the youth group leader starts talking about tests of faith that teens face and it\u2019s kind of like an open discussion type of thing. Everyone goes around and says their testimony of their experiences with tests of faith and they\u2019re all kind of what I expected- sexual temptation, drug/alcohol temptation, defiance toward their parents, etc. \n\nIdk why but the youth group leader decided to call on me (I guess bec I was new) and ask if I had an experience with a test of faith before. So I said the first thing that came to my head which was \u201cI think my faith wavered when I realized that an \u201call powerful\u201d god doesn\u2019t do anything to save his creation from suffering\u201d. He responds by saying \u201cI understand where you\u2019re coming from. But, I have to disagree. God helps those who seek him and blesses them with eternal life. Suffering on earth is a test of faith in God and those who withstand and overcome it are eternally blessed\u201d.  \n\nSo I said \u201cWhat about the people he didn\u2019t help? What about the people who pray and still suffer?\u201d And he says \u201cThe suffering isn\u2019t inflicted by God. It\u2019s by man. God gave us free will and because our earth is plagued with sin, we must choose to follow him. God doesn\u2019t intervene in earthly matters. He only judges thereafter.\u201d So at this point I was confused so I said \u201cIf god doesn\u2019t intervene in earthly matters, what\u2019s the point in praying if he can\u2019t intervene?\u201d\n\nThe youth leader just sighs and says \u201cThat\u2019s why we have faith\u201d and moves on to the next topic. My boyfriend barely looked at me and didn\u2019t say anything to me after that until we got to his car when he starts yelling at me saying I embarrassed him in front of his church friends by asking those types of questions. I defended myself and said where well the hell else am I supposed to get the answers to these types of questions if not at church? He says it was inappropriate and I shouldn\u2019t have said anything or just made something else up. He was stressing because his parents don\u2019t know that I\u2019m agnostic and he said they\u2019ll for sure find out now since his church friend\u2019s family are close with his family and they might not approve of our relationship anymore. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in the wrong here but he\u2019s been very short with me and things have just been tense since then and honestly I\u2019m thinking about just breaking it off so he can go find a Christian girl and his family will be happy.

You don't want a partner who will a) raise his voice at you for being curious or b) be more worried about what his family/friends think - because he is *lying to them -* than how you feel.", "NTA. If you dont ask questions about faith and religion at a church, then where the hell are you meant to ask them?", "NTA, he yelled at you for not lying because now his parents might find out a truth he\u2019s been hiding from them. \n\nI think he\u2019s the one struggling with his faith ...", "NTA \nYou should freely ask hard questions at churches and be able to challenge and think about things. I wish more people would honestly. If the bf doesn\u2019t like it tough cookies tbh \nPlus these are all great questions \nHe should be more willing to calmly talk and discuss your questions if he was wanting you to come and participate", "NTA what else did your BF expect that is common question people have when it comes to faith. Instead of trying to answer the leader should have just listened. Also listing defiance towards parebts as a temptation of faith is a great way to raise spineless kids (its healthy for kids, teens to occasionally rebel) the fact your BF is freaked out about his parents finding you are (clutch pearls) agnostic is an example of hin probably not going to stand up for you. You both are very young so stick with him or break up with him, you have your whole life ahead of you. But for your own personal growth do not let him make you fill like the AH and please call him out on his BS.", "NTA.\n\nYou were asked a direct question (which yikes youth leader is TA for singling out the newcomer on an intimate question like that) and answered sincerely with the thing that likely makes you agnostic rather than Christian.\n\nThis was an opportunity for him to talk about the meaning of faith, to help you with extremely difficult questions. Rather than doing that he singled you out further and made it out like you were unreasonable to ask. Probably because he didn\u2019t have a good answer ready. He is TA there. It\u2019s not your fault that many religious people never stop to truly examine their inherited beliefs. This is a question a lot of people of faith struggle with. My dad\u2019s a pastor and I have asked him the same questions and he at least was sincere enough to be honest about there not being a great answer, that sometimes evil things happen in an evil world for no reason, bigger pictures, unfolding plans\u2026 Life\u2019s unfair and sucky on this broken earth\u2026  Instead of being sincere this youth leader deflected to retain his power. That\u2019s TA. \n\nYour bf is lying to his parents and expects you to go along with it. He\u2019s not TA for inviting you to church to share in his faith and maybe get some questions answered for yourself but he is absolutely TA for making you feel bad when you offered a genuine and deep answer to the question you were asked and TA for lying, not telling you \u201coh btw my parents don\u2019t know you\u2019re agnostic\u201d, and being honest with you for not going along with a lie you didn\u2019t even know was told\u2026.", "NTA for asking questions. \n\nSince you're asking about why God doesn't help people or intervene. Here's my opinion on it. \n\nIf God were to help people or intervene then people wouldn't make their own choices to help or intervene, they'd just \"leave it to God\". People were given brains for a reason. You decide whether to help or intervene. It's about the choices you make during your life. Any suffering isn't really done by God but by  people who started the suffering. It was their choice. \n\nAs for praying, it's not all of a sudden going to get better within a day. That's why people keep praying on whatever they're dealing with. The problem is that people expect their prayers to be answered right away but it doesn't work like that. Having faith in prayers helps but it only goes as far as much as you believe it will.\n\nBtw, I want to add that I'm not religious and haven't been for years simply because religion wasn't for me.", "NTA. You asked a legit question and then he got mad because there wasn\u2019t a reasonable answer. Spoiler alert: you\u2019ll never hear a good answer to this question because there isn\u2019t one. But I might be the AH here because I hate religion because of my religious upbringing.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is TA for inviting you. It's assumed that if you're in a faith-based space, you're there because you share the faith. It is quite dickish to show up to a church group and then tell everybody they're wrong, that's not what the group is for. Atheists who do that are generally assholes.\n\nThat said, it's your boyfriend that insisted you go. He knew your beliefs and he can't expect you to lie. Probably he hoped you'd 'see the light' and his life would get easier, but that's not what happened and now he's got problems.\n\nThis relationship is more trouble than it's worth, and if you're already in the 'have sex and then pray the sin away' phase for him the inherent contradictions are just going to destroy his ability to be a decent boyfriend, which is already not exactly a forte of teenage boys. Let him find a nice Christian girl and you go have sex with someone who doesn't hate himself for it. DTMFA.", "NTA \n\nThe Pastor, an adult, asked you a question then attempted to bait you with answers. When those baits didn\u2019t work he finally moved on. \n\nPlus atheists and church groups don\u2019t really gel. \n\nYou can date someone religious. You just can\u2019t go to church and talk religion", "NTA. He invited you to the church group knowing you didn't share his beliefs. You were asked a question and you answered it (from your description of the interaction it seems you were respectful and honest). Your bf doesn't get to dictate what you can and cannot say. And this \"you should have made something up\" is ridiculous. What kind of faith does he have, if he thinks that faking it is ok?\n\nIt often happens that overly zealous religious Christians date non religious people with the intent of converting them. I'm not saying this is what your bf is doing, that's up to you to determine. I'm just saying it happens a lot.\n\nFrom my experience, religion is one of those things that both people in a relationship need to agree on in order to make it work. You may be tempted to change your beliefs for someone you love, but it rarely works in the long run. And you have too much life ahead of you to waste it on such people.", "NTA: your right to go with your feelings on this one and let him go find his good christian girl that mommy and father will approve of. I wonder if he was hoping you would have a miraculous coming to jesus moment and join the flock with him.", "OP, I am a Christian, and I have to say, you asked really good, legitimate questions. If those were the answers you were given, that youth leader gave you terrible, incorrect answers, and I'm sorry you experienced that. Asking difficult questions shouldn't cause embarrassment to anyone.", "NTA- you were nice enough to go to his cult meeting, and even thoughtfully participated.", "NTA. First, he\u2019s a bad boyfriend for yelling at you for that. That wasn\u2019t cool. It does sound like you are both in different places right now. Next, what that youth leader was teaching was horrible theology and has nothing to do with real biblical scholarship. It\u2019s the same Christian conformist bullshit I was fed all of my life and I thought the same as you do. As an adult now, I teach the Bible and I\u2019m on my church\u2019s staff (mostly music). If you\u2019re interested, feel free to DM me and I\u2019ll be more than happy to share a more realistic approach. Peace!\u270c\ufe0f", "NTA, but if your boyfriend doesn\u2019t accept the fact that you are agnostic, he shouldn\u2019t have invited you to church. You probably should not have gone, either. \nWhile I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong, you did embarrass him, though. Or he was embarrassed BY you, rather. Personally, I think anyone who yells at you for not hiding who you really are is probably not the person for you. \n\nSide facts, I am also agnostic and this brought me straight back to my days of asking legitimate questions in church and getting zero answers that made any logical sense. \ud83d\ude04", "Those were valid questions. i dont think either of you are AH. he is a teenage churchboy living with his religious parents so he has to consider them, for now.\n\ni am sorry OP, i think this relationship will not last..", "NTA. These are valid questions and I understand that the youth pastor probably didn\u2019t have time to go into a full discussion at the moment, he could have given you resources or talked to you after without blowing you off. \n\nAs a devout Christian, I understand why and how it can be confusing and challenging to understand why God \u201callows\u201d us to go through such hard trials. \n\nIn my personal experiences, I have learned so much about faith and God\u2019s love for me. I won\u2019t go on and on, I just hope you know that there\u2019s nothing wrong with asking questions.", "I asked my imaginary friend in the sky, and he said you're absolutely NTA.\n\nBut your relationship might be doomed, through no fault of yours.", "NTA. You honestly should find different people; I don't see this relationship working at all.
