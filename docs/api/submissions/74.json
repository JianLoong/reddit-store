Because Tanya has the mental age of a toddler she also doubled down on blaming you by trying to pretend the situation was your fault when actually she made everyone uncomfortable with her weird jealous behaviour and she clearly has her puppet, i mean friend, to agree and back her up on any of her insane made up drama because they are both high on Tanya\u2019s farts. \nDont listen to them & Stay away from Tanya and her friend.", "NtA what the actual fuck she insulted you and expected you to just take it and it\u2019s your fault that she put a damper on the party no you did nothing wrong sounds like you need a new group of friends", "NTA.", "NTA.

It wasn't a conversation starter or a question aboute \"evening make-up\", it was a straight up insult.\n\nIt's no different than asking \"don't you ever shower?\" because there's an underlying implication that there's something you really should do, but for some reason isn't doing.\n\nShe was goading you hoping you would make yourself look bad and in turn making her look like the victim.\n\nBut her plan backfired spectacularly because you told her that you don't not more than the basic stuff, something I suppose Tanya could have taken as a insult aimed at her as in \"no, I never learned more than the basic because I don't need it unlike you\".\n\nSo Tanya tries to up the game by telling you that she can teach you how to \"enhance you looks\" aka \"because damn do we all know that you need it\".\n\nAnd then Prince Charming completely ruins it by saying that you're pretty without any of her \"help\". \n\nShe is totally and utterly defeated and people like Tanya hate to loose.

Not sure what you are suggesting, but it was pleasant and interesting to those at the party until Tanya wigged out because OP got a compliment from another party-goer.", "/u/Deepganization399  is a comment-stealing bot. Original comment here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhzdkj/aita_for_unknowingly_making_myself_center_of/iuh4ft1/", "A phrase a some of them use is \u201eI don\u2018t even know how to do makeup\u201c but anyways op is NTA", "I totally thought the same as i read it that it was a nice gesture (and i probably wouldve too in real life) but just in hindsight with her behaviour it would make me see her actions in a new lens, like why was she so pissed off that someone complimented you, why was that so important to her that she reacted like that, very strange girl", "It's really weird to use it in this situation.\n\nI know more people who don't put on a full face of make-up than those who do.\n\nI also don't know anyone who would think it appropriate to ask why someone didn't wear full make up. What does it matter? The only reason I can think of someone asking that out of the blue is to put them down.\n\nNTA\n\nTanya sounds like an AH.", "I had to google it. Lol", "Not a man my friend. I am women. Agreed both sexes kinda suck. I am sick and tired of hearing how woman could run the world better. This story is a perfect example why that is not true. Women are too competitive against each other.", "Tanya's natural look probably has 20 different products and almost an hour tonapply. OP probably threw on some mascara and tinted chapstick and looked just as good. Obviously jealousy and a \"natural look\" don't look good on Tanya!", "I'm guessing that's why so many other people left. They didn't want the drama either.", "eeww to myself. i totally did that to a friend in like 7th grade.", "They mean that Tanya was never friendly to begin with. Her commenting on OP\u2019s lack of makeup was not in good nature, but rather insulting. She was trying to insult OP this whole time. And I can see it now, \u201cShe told me she can teach me how to apply makeup that would enhance my look\u201d. Sounds pretty backhanded to me. None of this was pleasant on Tanya\u2019s part", "So did I. But then again I'm old so I'm far out of the loop on current jargon. Hell, I was back when I was that age, back when dinosaurs roamed the Earth.", ">Women are too competitive against each other. \n\nIt's interesting you say this. I feel sometimes like something that holds women back is that they aren't competitive with one another. There is this idea that \"women always support one another\" that just ends with having no drive to improve. \n\nIf a man gets fat and can't get a date, other men will say \"Hit the gym loser, you can't expect someone to want you like this\". If a woman gets fat and can't get a committed relationship, it seems other women say \"Don't listen, you're perfect the way you are. Just keep being yourself and it will happen\".", "Oh to be fair, I never wear makeup, and once or twice my friends thought it woukd be fun to sit me down and give me a full face of makeup. My friend said that because I never wore it, it was fun to contemplate what she could do with my face and what products might work for me. I didn't mind - they wouldn't have done it if I hadn't consented, and it was nice to confirm that makeup feels really annoying and I'm glad I don't wear it every day.\n\nI think my friends would have only been assholes if a) they had forced me into it, or if b) they tried to convince me that I was SO MUCH BETTER with makeup and I should do it every day.\n\nTo be clear, they did say I looked really pretty after they put the makeup on me. But we all knew that this was a one off. They respected my life choice to not wear makeup 364 days out of the year, and didn't look down on me for it.\n\nI don't think consensual makeovers are a dick move. I understand it can be fun to put makeup on someone who never wears it, and I think that's fine so long as you remember that they're a human being and treat them with respect.", "Gotcha.  I see, now, what was meant!  You are right....Tanya was probably being catty and making digs about OP's appearance, and was ticked off when it turned against her.  I wasn't thinking of it from that angle, so thanks for your input!"]}
