That\u2019s weird! All visitors\u2019 plans should be made with parents full knowledge and approval.", "NTA, it\u2019s weird that nobody talks to each other though. Why was the friend still in the house when the step daughters were out at work? \ud83e\udee0", "NTA - \n\nAny visitors should be discussed by both partners in a relationship, it is your home too.  \n\nOpen ended stays should definitely be discussed along with any reason why.  \n\nWhile there may be mitigating reasons that might make you agree - ie I've housed one of my child's friends due to a parental medical emergency with no set timeframe a \"I'm bored and I want my friend to hang out\" is different.", "Not the same, but similar. My son had a friend, Tyler, from a sports team that stayed with us a lot. I really didn't mind because he kept my son occupied and he was very easy and zero maintenance, unlike my son! Ate anything I served, was polite and respectful and they would hang out in the basement and play video games. This was junior high age in the summers and holidays.\n\nTyler's mom was a friend of mine and he was the youngest of four boys. There was always some kind of drama revolving around one or two of his brothers and I honestly feel that his parents just kind of forgot about him. His dad was just starting his own business and mom was involved with it and I think they were relieved they didn't have to worry about him. I would ask when his folks wanted him home and he'd say he didn't know. So he stayed. I think a week was the longest. My son Mike stayed at Tyler's place one night and there were no sheets on his bed and a big hole in the middle of his mattress. The hardwood floors were covered in drifts of fur from their two large dogs. So I kind of understood why Tyler was good sleeping on an air mattress in a finished basement.\n\nThe boys ended up going to different high schools and drifted apart. But I do know Tyler's doing well and married, and I hope he's happy.", "NTA. Fish and guest", "Why didn\u2019t you just ask her ?", "Not to be that person, but are you sure he doesn\u2019t have anything going on with the girl?

NTA btw", "So, he prioritizes his daughter above his wife?\n\nSomething is wrong with this picture...\n\nSounds like he is not on a team with you.", "She should\u2019ve been home .. your step daughters weren\u2019t even there", "INFO: did you ever talk to your daughter/her friend? Like I\u2019ve been the friend that was over at a friends house for days on end but that was because her mom liked hosting people and having me around. I also have a friend who stays with my family for a few days at a time and because she has MDD and sometimes just needs to bum it with another person I don\u2019t ask questions. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as weird as most commenters are saying it is. If I were you I would be worried about her home life and why she wants to be at your house for that long.I would also ask your step daughter if she has talked to her friend to find out what\u2019s going on. It is definitely a joint decision on when/how long epople are allowed in your home between you and your husband, but if you\u2019re unwilling to share your home with a teen in a possibly unsafe or unhealthy situation (as long as it doesn\u2019t have a negative impact on your fam) then I definitely don\u2019t agree with your morals.", "NTA apparently his daughter runs the show in their parent-child relationship.", "NTA\n\nShe's a minor in your home. You have every right to know and decide if she's staying, not the 16 year old.\n\nAnd frankly, there needed to be a discussion with the other parents if it was going to be long term. Your husband is being immature not discussing it", "NTA. You really should have been consulted about this, considering that this is your home as well. And if the duration of the visit were going to be left to your step-daughter, you should have been consulted on that decision as well.\n\nI'm nor very impressed with your husband's conflict resolution skills - he avoids the issue, them when he finally has to talk to you about it, he argues with you about it, then leaves the house for hours at a time and refuses to talk to you when he comes back.\n\nNow, if this friend was staying with you because she was in a dangerous situation at home, that should have been discussed with you as well - after all, it would have been relevant information you would have needed to make your decision.", "NTA", "NTA but why didn't you talk to the girls about it and find out why she was staying there. This isn't much of a home for you if this is the dynamic.", "NTA- I have 13 step kids, and my 2 kids were my husband's step kids until he adopted them. My first husband (9 of the kids father) always put his kids above me and allowed their mothers and the kids to run our household (before we had our 2 kids, I was the youngest of all the moms yet I was raising their 9 kids while they went out clubbing and not caring for their kids so I became a mother of 9 before becoming a mom, only good thing about this is now that all kids are adults I still have a relationship with them all ) but also my daughter had a friend who ended up staying with us for months. At first, it was just they asked if she could stay Friday -Sunday which my current husband and I both said yes no problem then she ended up not leaving and we liked the girl and we thought she was a good influence on my daughter. When Tuesday came around my husband and I were talking wondering what was going on (we didn't allow friends to stay the night during the week ) We brought both girls into the living room and asked what was going on. We found out her mother, who was a major addict had kicked her out, so she was homeless. We did not want to see this so we set rules like she had set chores that had to be done daily/weekly (depending on the chore), they both had to go to school and do all school work everyday, she had a job so she had to go to work every scheduled day and save 80% of her paycheck, as well as follow all the house rules as if she was our biological daughter. They both agreed, and the friend was great and did everything better than my daughter. When they both started to slack on the rules we gave warning then a 2nd and 3rd time was the charm and we had to kick her out at this time she was able to go to a family members home and we still have a great relationship and she apologizes everytime she comes over to visit and says how much she loves us. \nSo with all this said, tell/talk with your husband about 1. your communication with not only the two of you but the communication with the kids. 2. How kids are not to run the household that the parents are supposed to. 3. How even though you are the step parent, you need to be seen as the parental figure and equal partner in your house. 4. How if the kids are going to make up what happens in the house since they have jobs that means they need to pay 1/4 of all bills (assuming there is just the 4 of you in the home. 5. What the house rules are (how long and when can friends stay/ go home, etc.", "NTA, husband needs to grow up and parent his child. If a friend needs a place to stay for whatever reason that\u2019s fine but someone adult needs to know what is going on.", "NTA, 4 days without discussing it is way too much. Your husband should support you.", "NTA four days is three, maybe two, days too long. Especially if you weren\u2019t consulted.", "INFO:  who is having to make dinner to accommodate this extra person?", "NTA but is he really a parent? \n\n>He said that it\u2019s up to his daughter when she leaves. I said no it is up to us the parents.\n\nSince when do children dictate the length of a friend's visit? Unless there's a safety issue at her home, 4 days is long enough.", "NTA. \n\n4 days is a ridiculous amount of time especially when the daughters haven\u2019t even been there the whole time with their guest.\n\nI 100% agree (as a parent myself) that house rules are set by parents. I\u2019m not sure why male parents tend to lean toward letting their kids make decisions like this? The fact that he\u2019s tantrum-ing over this is very weird.", "ESH - why didn\u2019t you talk to your stepdaughter? And the friend? Find out what their plans were, why she was staying so long etc. You knew your husband wouldn\u2019t know because he lets her do as she wishes. If her friend had an issue at home then you could help them possibly and if everything was fine at her house you could have suggested they both stay at hers for awhile. I understand not wanting a long term guest when you were consulted but there was a better way to deal with it.", "NTA unless there\u2019s a safety issue at her house there isn\u2019t really a reason for her to spend that long at your house", "NTA but are you sure you\u2019re not missing some key facts about this girl? What parent or guardian allows their child to stay at someone else\u2019s home for an indefinite period of time? Why would this girl want to stay at your house while her friend is at work? It\u2019s also kind of odd that as soon as the girl heard you didn\u2019t want her there, she left. I think something is going on with her. Maybe your husband knows about it and doesn\u2019t feel he can tell you for some reason. I think you should ask more questions.", "He won't have anything to do with you?  Time to start planning how to leave this relationship.", " So these are step daughters. You had to realize he would take the side of his own kids. Kids that age love to have friends hang out, but you don't mention any specific behavior that may be causing the strife. \n\nNeed more information to judge what's happening.", "YTA. Teenagers actually prefer their own homes and their own bedrooms, unless something bad is going on at home. Your griping sent that girl back to what is very likely a bad environment. You couldn't even talk to her directly, and you think you're an adult with authority? Your husband probably said he needed to ask his daughter because she would have a better idea of what's going on in her friend's home than he would, for obvious reasons.   \n\n\nI think it's telling that you were descriptive about everything except the argument between the two of you.", "My cousin was on a sports team w a kid who didn't want to move with his parents his Jr yr of high school so moved in with grandma but got rides from cousins parents. \n\nAt some point his mom just decided to keep him. They had a combined graduation party.", "Dads not in the right here but that\u2019s a wild overarching statement;  you absolutely should prioritize your child over your spouse.", "As OP said in her post, it is because that is not the decision of the children but of the parents.", "The OP doesn't list that there's even an issue with her being at THIS house, though. If she's not being disruptive and it's a \"just because,\" thing with no investigation as to why she's there, then idk what OP is struggling with unless it's deliberately left out", "It's winter break so the parents probably don't care because there isn't any school. The work thing is weird tho. I honestly wouldn't want anyone over for that long unless that kid was in a bad situation.", "\nI was not gripping, I was simply asking a question to my husband and letting him know how I feel about the situation. It\u2019s called having an adult conversation. \n\nSo here is some back story for you. \nMy husband is from another country and we brought his 3 daughters to live with us around the same time he became a permanent resident. He has been living in this country for 8 months and back in his home country for 4 months on going for 14 years. He has a very hard time saying no to his daughters. He feels he should give them what ever they want. He is getting better but it is slow going. As for me going to talk to her, that would be worse because she has no respect.", "Nothing bad happened at my house, my parents were/are wonderful but I still preferred to be at friends houses.", "You\u2019re making an awful lot of assumptions. You have absolutely no idea if anything that you\u2019ve typed is actually true. Still, it\u2019s good to know you have an open door policy for anybody who\u2019s had an argument with a parent, maybe you should put a notice in your window, although you\u2019ve probably already done that.", "Disagree. This is a very bold assumption considering we have absolutely no background on this girls actual home life. Me and my friends would spend a week together at each others houses a lot because it\u2019s basically like a little vacation with your friend (with the knowledge and permission of the hosting parents ofc) The step daughter should\u2019ve just been spoken to and she should have dealt with her friend accordingly.", "The amount of NTAs on here is so weird to me because this post has so little information that probably could have been included but wasn't. There's more about the way the husband reacted to whatever it was she said than the content of what she was actually saying.\n\nOP, did you ask WHY the friend was there? Was she disruptive? Did she cause any problems or was it just being there that bothered you? What did she overhear that upset her so much? If you had an argument without asking any of these questions, I'm trying to understand what it was actually about. My best friend growing up and I used to trade houses over vacation breaks back and forth, one week off and one on, and if either set of parents either took issue with it they would politely ask if there was a period of time where they could have time on their own with their kid, and it was fine and there were no hard feelings. \n\nThere is really nothing to go on here for me to make a judgment at all. I don't know if there was a reason the friend needed to leave or if it was a \"just because\" thing and OP just didn't bother investigating. The whole tone rubs me the wrong way.", "It\u2019s not OPs problem, she didn\u2019t sign up for housing and additional child, end of story.", "In the OP's post, it would seem that these principles are missing:  A strong marriage that is a team - that presents itself as a loving team to children - is a marriage in agreement, making decisions together.  Together, they prioritize eachother in the marriage - and make good healthy decisions for the children/kids/teens.  \n\nKids/children are absolutely a priority in the family unit and in life - but it takes a strong and loving team marriage to have a successful marriage with a family.\n\nIf children are prioritized in a way that violates the team aspect of the marriage agreements, it throws the marriage out of balance, and as in the example we've been shown, the husband is not treating his wife like they are a team, and his prioritizing his daughter over his wife in this example - is a problem.\n\nThere are some relationships that are dysfunctional or abusive or harmful marriages where children MUST be protected and prioritized over the spouse.", "I agree with you but obviously this decision was made by the dad and the girls and OP was out of the loop.", "I realize there\u2019s more flexibility because of winter break, but that still doesn\u2019t explain why the duration of the visit is indefinite. When I was a teenager, I had a friend whose mother let me stay over during school breaks but my parents never let it go on for more than three days and they were in constant contact with my friend\u2019s mother.", "Why did you feel that way? Were they being rude or disruptive or was it a \"just because?\" thing? There's very little content to the way the argument allegedly went so I'm wondering about how the subject was approached that made the girl leave and the dad angry, because the story you're presenting here seems to be leaving out anything but the bare bones needed to get a NTA verdict", "So you've been in their lives for fourteen years, and the stepdaughter who doesn't respect you is sixteen? You're more of a mother to her than her own then, aren't you? Any respect you don't have, after all this time, is status quo. It sucks, and I'm not saying it's right at all. But if it's been like this for more than a decade and you're not happy, it's on you for staying this long.", "Okay yeah we agree. So many people jsut think that the sanctity of marriage is more important than anything and then stay with people who are hurting their children and it\u2019s so fucked", "I met the girls a few years ago. Him and I have been married for 2 years. The girls have been here with us for 1.5 years. The soon to be 17 year old has been trouble since she was still with her mom at 12. Does and says what she pleases. We agreed on bringing her here because we know she will have a better life then in Jamaica.", "Have you ever met a teenager?", "If your husband won\u2019t have anything to do with you over such a stupid reason and his daughter\u2019s wishes come before yours then maybe it\u2019s time to rethink this relationship. Does he always sulk like this after an argument?"]}
