While it is your own preference to not wear different laces with your shoes, you could have gone to the shop where you originally bought the shoes and asked if they sell those laces. If you're artistically inclined, you could've tried DIYing them. And as a last resort, as other people have mentioned, you could've donated them in order to reduce waste and maybe help someone out along the way.\nAlso, you said you're looking for a job at the moment and it sounds like you're living with your mum full-time. Are you paying rent and utilities? If not, that might be why your mother got so furious (in the sense that you don't pay rent but in her eyes \"waste\" your money). Otherwise, she might just want you to value the things you have, be sensible with money and not be wasteful.\nJust as a little piece of advice, maybe once you've both cooled down, tell her that you'd appreciate her talking to you like an adult and not yelling at you next time she has a gripe with you - that's just not effective and appropriate communication for two adults, even when it is a parent and their child.", "YTA\n\nWhy not get your dog appropriate chew toys instead of buying new shoes and tossing instead of reusing or donating perfectly good shoes?

I guess I'm more materialistic than I thought I was...", "I wouldn't call you materialistic for this. There's nothing wrong with you getting a new pair of shoes like you did. \n\nBut instead of throwing away the shoes, maybe just add a new pair of laces and then donate them? I'm sure a charity shop would take them, or there are those clothes/shoe donation bins (containers?  Those huge metal ones) sometimes."]}
