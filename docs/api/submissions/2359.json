That's awesome, and it gives your kid time to be a kid for as long as possible.\n\nHowever I also understand where your husband is coming from.

Our kids did not work during high school to allow for them to keep high grades as well as participate in extra-curricular activities. They did have summer jobs though. They saved that money to pay for their fun & things they wanted during the school year. Since they were involved in sports, getting their certifications to officiate sports they were interested in was a good choice. In one weekend of reffing at a tournament they could make $400. NTA but there are ways to do this without impacting school or activities. It also teaches them to save & use their money wisely.", "NAH but i agree with your husband 100%. Having a job helps kids and teen learn soft skills and learn good work ethic that will help in the long run. They learn money management, how to schedule time, and it gets them more social skills in dealing with the public.

Jobs are a very valuable life skill, and a part-time job can be balanced with school. Many colleges offer jobs geared towards students through the school that are very flexible and compatible with school hours. It\u2019s doing both of your children a disservice to not have them both learning the life skill of working before being expected to hold down a full time job once school is done.

Explain to your son that your daughter has a different father who has a different parenting style, and that his situation is different because his father thinks that getting a job at this stage would help build work ethic and responsibility. Honestly, you can do whatever you want but I\u2019m of the mind that a part-time job at 16 is a good thing. Even if it\u2019s just 8 hours on Saturday, something where he can learn to be responsible and make some money for himself. That is, if he can handle work and school at the same time. I worked 30 hours through high school and still graduated top 5%, so getting a job does not necessarily ruin your academics. That said, talk to your husband about your parenting goals and let him know that you are not necessarily in favor of having your son get a job.
