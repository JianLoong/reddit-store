I started working for them during the pandemic. I worked from home fulltime until the beginning of 2023 when it became required to come into the office 2 days a week. Most of my job is client-facing, so I'm on the road quite a bit and am only in-office on average 3-5 hours a week. I'm friendly with everyone in my office but am not friends with any of them. I've never spent time with any coworkers outside of work hours aside from a few happy hours over the past few years.\r  \n\r  \nEvery year my office does a Secret Santa where everyone fills out a survey of gifts they'd like to receive, HR picks givers and recipients randomly, and then you buy your recipient a $50 gift. My manager (\\~50F) reached out at the beginning of November to asked me to fill out the survey for Secret Santa. I told her that she did not need to include me, as I'd be out of town for our Christmas party (the week between Xmas and New Years,) which she had approved. She told me it was fine and I could bring the gift for my recipient before I left and then I'd receive my gift when I returned. I told her I am not going to do that, and that she should just exclude me from the gift exchange. We've been going back and forth this whole month.\r  \n\r  \nShe cornered me in the office this week to ask why I wouldn't participate. I told her the truth, which is that I am going on a vacation between Christmas and New Years with a few of my girlfriends as a joint celebration of our recent 30th birthdays. It is an expensive trip, I've been saving up for a long time, and I am trying to save money for the trip. Not to mention I typically live paycheck to paycheck around the holidays already to be able to afford gifts for my nieces and nephews, who I love dearly and actually WANT to buy gifts for. Well, she DID NOT like this answer and told me that I am being selfish and that it's only $50 for a gift to show my coworkers that I care about them, and that in this office we are a family.\r  \n\r  \nThis is where I could be the asshole. I told her that while I like my coworkers just fine, I don't need to buy them gifts because they are not my loved ones. $50 could cover a manicure before I left for vacation, a souvenir while I'm there, part of a nice dinner, or any number of gifts for my family or friends, neither of which my coworkers are. I also told her it was wildly inappropriate of her to keep pushing this with me, as she has no idea what my financial situation is and if she kept asking me about it, I would be going to HR to file a complaint.\r  \n\r  \nI went into the office again today to take care of a few things before Thanksgiving weekend, and EVERYONE is giving me the cold shoulder. My manager is a huge gossip and I know she told everyone what went down between us. My surprise comes from the fact that most of my coworkers seem like rational people who would understand where I'm coming from and not judge me for not participating.

This is wild... definitely NTA though the HR rep is!!!  Can you report HR to HR for harassment?!  Also.... this line:\n\n\\> everyone fills out a survey of gifts they'd like to receive\n\nSo... you tell your secret santa what you want... how is this showing your co workers you care about them...?  How is it even FROM someone else at this point?   It becomes purely an exercise in logistics.", "NTA. And am I crazy for thinking $50 is pretty extravagant? Any office I've worked in is like $25 tops", "NTA\n\nYour manager however is, and you should speak to HR. Secret Santa should always be voluntary, not forced. If work requires you to do it, then they should pay you extra to do so.", "Nta, document everything that happens and prepare to gave to defend yourself at HR level if necessary. \n\nThe ONLY way you would be the AH here is if you'd signed up to receive a gift but never sent one. Choosing not to participate at all is fair enough.", "NTA.\n\nYour manager is, especially for telling the others.", "I hate offices like this.  NTA.  I feel for you - I had similar issues with baby showers at my last company. I had just found out I couldn\u2019t have children and was dealing with bad depression. They kept asking me to join in for baby shower gifts (their goal for 25 employees was to buy a car seat and stroller and wanted to get around 2k for gifts and catering). \n\nI didn\u2019t contribute and I didn\u2019t attend.", "NTA- good grief!  Trying to force someone to participate in this is awful.", "Ntah. Why should it be a requirement? That takes the fun out of it. My office we are all very close, some don\u2019t want to participate, totally fine. A few that a lot of are particularly close to get teased but we also knew before it started they wouldn\u2019t. If it\u2019s forced it\u2019s not a fun thing.", "NTA - 50$???? I don\u2019t pay that for my children\u2019s gifts. F*** her, you don\u2019t have to participate in stupid traditions if you don\u2019t want to. Next time just say it\u2019s against your religion and she will have to accept and will be legally forbidden from insisting.", "NTA - But I would talk to HR, the company is forcing people to partake in religious holidays. I know it's commercialized but I don't celebrate Xmas and I am also forced to celebrate at work and tbh the whole thing is awkward. I also don't want to spend money on coworkers I'm not close to, why waste my money that way.", "NTA\n\nI'd be interested in hearing a comment from someone with labor law experience, but I don't think it's legal (in the U.S.) to force someone to participate in a Secret Santa. It would be an unreimbursed business expense. \n\nIt's debatable whether it's even a good idea to do a Secret Santa voluntarily, because office culture pressures can lead people to do feel they don't have a real choice as to whether to participate. I'm surprised that HR manages this, but they should be informed that \n\nI would add that you didn't owe the Manager your reasons for not participating. No is a complete sentence, and it's none of her business.\n\nPressure to participate followed by retaliation on her part is a serious matter. You should definitely have a conversation with HR; she's way out of bounds.", "NTA. Your manager can eat shit. Document everything and take it to HR.", "NTA you shouldn't be obligated to buy a gift for someone, especially if they aren't a loved one.", "You kinda want to explain yourself, and your reasoning, and rationale, to your boss. Wouldn\u2019t it have been easier to reply \u201cI cannot afford it, I am truly sorry\u201d. It doesn\u2019t have to be even the whole truth and nothing but the truth - white lies can go a long way in social situations.", "Any office that says they are like \u201cfamily\u201d - nope. That\u2019s a massive red flag. You are NTA. Your boss is.", "NTA\n\nBut you are sticking out now and offices are horrible clique high school placea that in turn can affect actual work and positions. Next time just do the thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso she most likely lied and made you look bad towaeds your coworkers. Honestly, report her to HR.", "NTA! Nobody should ever be pressured to participate in a gift exchange and you should never have to give your reasons why. No is enough of an answer. Don;t worry about it, you aren't in the office enough anyway. Enjoy your holidays, your trip, and your birthday!\n\nI totally get where you are coming from! At my school, in October, the administrative assistants put notes in all our mailboxes that it was time to think about Christmas for our principal and pastor, and that we should begin budgeting now so we can contribute to their Christmas gifts! I live paycheck to paycheck and have a 2nd part time job. If I have any extra money for presents it is going to be for my family (who I have not bought presents for in years) not the pastor who does not pay us a living wage. I can't tell you how many of us were mad and promptly threw the note where it belongs!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hell, my family started doing it years ago and after missing out twice because the person who got me 'forgot' and another year I got a gift voucher... I said my wife and I were out.  It has put a few noses out of joint but I don't care.  I very unapologetically said I was fine to buy myself a gift which would be great, because I'll actually get something, and it will be something I want - and my not taking part in it by no means precludes them from doing so.", "I'm a public school teacher, so my standards might be different because of our poor pay *lolsob*, but I've never seen one run over 20-25 max.", "In my previous job it was less than that. I think $15. When I do my cookie party at my house with friends, we do $20.", "If spending $50 on a work-related event is mandatory, you should be able to send it in on an expense report and get reimbursed.

Because finance will make HR do it.\n\nOh yeah. At my work there are various optional ones with way lower budgets (think $5-$10), and even that can be a squeeze during the holidays. And that's a max, I remember doing my last one, brought a tacky mug for a couple of quid they still use daily. It's work, the budget stays small, and always optional. And possible to drop out late, with the expectation the boss will pick up the slack.\n\nCheap gifts can be awesome, last xmas my gift to my BIL was the star (\u00a320 table top air hockey game). \u00a350 would be an immediate sibling on a good money year.\n\nDefinitely true \"we're family\" only works when it cuts both ways. Family is supposed to understand if you can't afford things, and not guilt you over it."]}
