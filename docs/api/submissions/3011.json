Humping is often a sign of aggression and can lead to problems in a dog park and I've seen big problems because of it.   \n\n\nI had to kick a dog off of my Doberman because it BIT him while it was humping him. I tried to grab it and yank it off multiple times while my dog was crying... then the dog came back and bit his neck while humping him and at that point I had to kick it. Me and my dog were bawling (because it wasn't the dog's fault, it was his shitty owner) and the owner was like \"he's a labrador, not like your dog.\" Uhhh.... excuse me.  \n\n\nNeedless to say, we only go to dog parks when his dad is around now. People don't challenge his dad like they do me.", "I\u2019m unsure as to why you stopped protecting your dog. And why you didn\u2019t just kick it in the guts", "Why would hump, thrust and mount need censoring?\n\nNTA", "I know, makes me sad because one of our dogs LOVES the dog park, but we've had too many F'd up situations with terrible dog owners. Now he can only go occasionally when his dad is ready to deal with crappy people.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "Just, no. If someone, or some animal, is putting hands or paws or other appendages on you or your child or your own pet, you are very much entitled to get them off. It\u2019s ridiculous to expect OP to just stand there while the owner is refusing to intervene.", "What the hell. I'm really sorry that happened to you and your dog. \n\nI will protect my dog at all costs. She will not get humped by an untrained oversexed dog. If they can't or won't control their dog, I will. \n\nThis is absolutely bizarr. I wouldve given the other owner shit over it.", "Wait - you're at the park 'right now' but this has been bugging you for 2 days?", "Clearly you didn\u2019t read the OP\u2019s comment carefully enough: \u201cwhich is why i reposted this after it was initially auto-removed for the H word\u201d", "Yes!!!", "There's also a really great one Kent.", "Have you read the name of the subreddit?", "I expect other dog owners to get their dog off of my dogs immediately.  If they don't, I do.  I won't tolerate dissent and am prepared to get physical with the dog and/or the irresponsible owner.\n\nNTA", "NTA - This is just so\u2026bizarre. It sounds like a weird episode of The Twilight Zone. You have the right to stop any person or animal who is harassing your dog.", "NTA this is part of the reason I stopped going to dog parks. The people.", "NTA\n\nOwners like that ruin dog parks. If they cannot stop their dog from humping other people's animals THEY need to leave. \n\nI've personally encountered this and ran into a similar situation where I had tried everything else. I had asked for help from the owners, I had gone to the other side of the park to get away, the only option left was to physically move the other dog so that mine could get away yet for some reason they believed I was the AH. \n\nFurious on your behalf", "NNTA If your dog is in heat and you brought her to a dog park then that is on you but if your dog is spayed and this dog is running around humping everyone\u2019s dog then he\u2019s trying to show dominance and that shouldn\u2019t be encouraged.", "NTA wtf that is what harnesses are for! Being able to safely grab onto a dog without hurting it!\n\nMy dog has humped other dogs before and I would not be mad if someone stopped him physically but I also proactively watch him to make sure he doesn't do it because it's embarrassing", "NTA- dog parks are the worst place for dogs. I\u2019m sure your dog would prefer a structured walk with you, or a play date with a trusted dog away from all those lunatic owners and out of control dogs.", "NTA. That dog and apparently also his owner aren\u2019t properly socialised. Yes, grabbing a strangers dog should be the last resort but the guy wasn\u2019t giving you any other options after refusing to step in himself. Other dog owners are probably the worst part of having a dog.", "NTA \n\nDogs are not children. If he isn\u2019t going to control his dog then you have to do so. \n\nPeople that see animals as people can create very dangerous situations. Once at a party a person\u2019s pitbull lunged at me toward my throat. He was caught and I watched the owner give him hugs and  she kept a saying it is okay. I looked at my BF at the time and said we are leaving. I made clear we are NEVER going there again because that dog is untrained and the response to my life being threatened by a dog is not to give him a hug and tell him how much he is loved.", "NTA but you also need a primer in dog behaviour.  Humping is a normal part of social interaction in a pack.  The fact that your dog is walking away is a sign he's a submissive dog, which is why he's being \"targeted\".  If you let it continue, your dog will get annoyed to the point of turning and making the other dog stop.  Then it should be over.  It's dramatic, but normal.", "NTA. You have every right to be there with your dog and you have every right to keep your dog happy.", "NTA\n\nTell the owner since he is not controlling his dog you had two options restrain his dig with the harness,  or kick it in the balls.\n\nAll of he would prefer option A (he controls his dog) or option C ball kicking) since B is off the table.", "NTA if you had kicked or otherwise hurt the other dog it'd be different, but I don't see what's wrong about grabbing the dog by its harness. It's the guys fault for not respecting your wishes.", "Honestly as much as this sucks it\u2019s pretty tame for dog parks.  Most dog trainers recommend staying far far away from parks (cause people bring their terribly behaved dogs and all it takes is one split second for your dog to be attacked/traumatized).  Trust me you are definitely nta but you may be better off avoiding dog parks all together.", "Hi I'm a professional dog trainer, I do not recommend dog parks at all. I've seen far too many clients with reactive dogs that were fine with other dogs until an incident at the dog park. All it takes is one poorly behaved dog with an inattentive (or in this case idiotic) owner for fights to break out. OP did the responsible thing stepping in to advocate for their own dog and frankly the offending dog is an incident waiting to happen.", "In this case, smaller sounds better. Use the dog park for socialisation and walking for exercise. You can also buy anti-mount vests for female dogs who are in heat.\n\nIf you want a better way to socialise your dog I recommend looking online for local dog groups and group walking activities. Or you can arrange your own and extend invitations to people you've met whom you know have trained their pooches."]}
