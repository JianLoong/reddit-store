Instead of claiming everything is about equality, why not equity? Why not 60/40 split so that she could have the means to save more money for these exact scenarios if you refuse to aid her. \n\nBut that\u2019s probably none of my business \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA\n\nWhat?

A lawyer makes more than for example a nurse, even for the same amount of hours. You're partners, so you should want to support each other and make sure contribution is equal based on income. Not saying you should both be able to save up the same amount (that's difficult if you earn three times more, because that may mean you need to pay for everything and that's also not right. But most partners go 40-60 or 35-65, depending on income, working hours, etc.).\n\nBut, putting that aside... it sound like you didn't even care much about whether she was there or not, because you didn't even consider looking for options. From paying part of her trip, or looking into \"loaning it\" options, or just talking about whether she would be okay with you going without her, as she also has a family trip (presumably without you, based on your words).
