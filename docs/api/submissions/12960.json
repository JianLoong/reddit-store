For context, she is a professional ballerina, that might give the public a better idea of how slim she is.\n\nMy MIL on the other hand, is dreadful. She is always asking Opal for money, visiting at the least convenient moments, and being insufferable. For the reader to have an adequate example, she asks everything from why do we live in a one room setup having money for a luxury place, to questions about our sex life, assuming we have none from the fact that I don't particularly like people physically approaching me, and I refrain from kissing or hugging my wife in public. But overall, her favorite topic is my wife's weight and appearance. Every time she leaves, my wife will go up to three days on a single daily protein shake, needless to say it bothers me, but she's her mother and I thought I was in no position to interfere on their relationship.\n\nYesterday though, it reached a dead end.

Your MIL is abusing your wife, and you not only every right, but a moral obligation to do what you did! \n\nDo not even get me started on the severe health side effects that can result from malnutrition induced by eating disorders. Let me put it this way, I have a family friend who cannot remember the first year of her daughter's life after having a severe stroke, and heart attack caused by malnutrition from an eating disorder. An eating disorder that was triggered by her mother's incessant body shaming(surprise). She's lucky that she even survived.\n\nYou do whatever you have to do to protect your wife, and get her the help she needs to be healthy. Don't back down!

It's possible that your wife's situation is the same, of course, I don't know the context, but most dancers begin training when they're still really damn young, so it's easier for these ideas to be internalized if she has been hearing this type of comments from her mom since she was a child, the lack of boundaries between you two and her mom makes sense. After seeing how an ed can affect someone's life and overall social life, maybe you should keep mil as far as you can before this mentality interferes with your wife's career and her health. I hope you can work this through", "Definitely NTA  \n\nMIL is harming your wife in an insidious way.   She's obviously given her an eating disorder, and does not care.   \n\nThis is seriously bad for your wife's health, as I'm sure you're aware.    \n\nIf you can, go NC with both MIL & BIL for as long as it takes to get your wife in a healthy mind set.", "NTA.  Good on you for standing up to MIL and supporting your wife.\n\nMIL is TOXIC!  Ballet dancers are noted to have eating disorders (not saying your wife does but it apparently isn't uncommon in that world).  Your wife likely has been subjected to weight comments her entire ballet life.  Your MIL should be supporting her and not berating her.  More important than your MIL's comments about your wife's weight is whether or not her doctor says she is healthy.  However, the therapist is a good idea for your wife to deal with the body image issue and her toxic mother.", "NTA. You are protecting your wife by going No Contact with your MIL. \n\nBallerinas have it hard already, no doubt she has a pretty strict diet with what she needs to eat for training and shows, having her abusive mother in her ear pushing her towards an eating disorder will kill her. \n\nDon't even answer the phone to your MIL or BIL. Block them all from both your phones and definitely go to therapy to help your wife work through the trauma of having a mother like that.", "NTA- this is an immediate concern!

Your MIL is toxic and abusive toward your wife, and it's *good* that you are standing up for her.\n\nMIL is the MAJOR AH here.\n\nBut your wife is an adult, and it is wrong to attempt to take away her agency in this way. You can't dictate her relationships.\n\nAnd that sucks in this case. I know it sucks. You want to protect her and she's obviously unable/unwilling to protect herself, currently. She's sick, and she needs treatment.\n\nBut if you start taking away her agency.. her *control*, she's liable to get worse, not better. What goes into (and comes out of) her body is something she's able to control, and the less in control of her life she feels, the more she will restrict that.\n\nIt's a tricky situation and you need to act delicately. I'd start with a sit down heart-to-heart talk with your wife.\n\nActually... I'd start with some research.

If the roles were reversed, would she allow it?\n\nI hope one day your wife realizes that her mother comments on her weight to hold control over her. They only weight she needs to drop is her mother.", "NTA, but it is her mom. I'd run it by her before you say anything else. \n\nEDIT: Your intentions are good, but it's not your place to say if the MIL can visit.

Your heart is in the right place, but you need to help her draw this line, not draw it yourself. I strongly support talking to your wife about therapy.

Not in some manly duty sense but in the \u2018you don\u2019t want to see your wife hurting\u2019 sense. Definitely listen to her, and respect her decision regarding how she handles her mom, she is still an adult. However, I imagine this bullying and harassment has been something she has always just taken from her and might need help breaking out of that abusive relationship. Good luck OP, that is a tough situation, you can\u2019t push her to change to much, the change needs to come from her.", "It sounds like you haven't asked you wife whether she wants to bar her mother.

Wtf is his problem.\nMIL is obviously an AH\n\nOne thing though:\nStop focusing on your wife\u2019s appearance. Don\u2019t try to control what she eats. You can bring up concerns, for instance by telling her that you think she has an eating disorder and that you\u2019re worried about her physical and mental health.\n\nHowever, if you try to control what she eats, you may make it worse.

If a comment like that triggered bulimia....you have bigger problems than the MIL\n\nGood luck to both of you\nNTA", "Thank you. That is most helpful", "Thank you!", "She will never want to ban her mother. She sees her behavior as very normal. And certainly, I am not one to wait around the topic until it's too late to do something", "Yes. She has an unhealthy obsession with being in the spotlight after my wife has been on stage, which I am sure she wishes she did more often.", "MIL knows, and yes, she actually added that Opal should stop eating, because her teeth would be damaged. So it is not about throwing up being dangerous for her, it is just about not damaging her looks", "Yep, and her mother just tossed fuel to the fire by constantly commenting on her daughter's appearance. Dancers have so much pressure to maintain a certain weight in general, and ballerinas it's on another level. That's why OP trying to tell her she's pretty doesn't work - it's an eating disorder (and likely body dysmorphia) issue. Finding a therapist is good, but they need to specialize in EDs. For a lot of people, a more clinical approach first helps, rather than trying to break down the root of the problem. It's her mom, she loves her mom, she probably thinks her mom \"wants what's best for her\" and \"want to help.\" And while it's important to unpack that eventually, since she's engaging in purging behavior, she's likely not at the place to unpack that yet. Ultimately, that's up for her to decide, but I'd say to be careful bringing up her mother or making negative comments about her. It'll make wifey go on the defensive, she needs to reach the conclusion that her mother is abusive on her own time table.\n\nI recommend the book *I'm Glad My Mom Died* by Jeanette McCurdy for OP to read. Jeanette talks about how her mother taught her to become anorexic at 11, and the pressures of being a child actor which meant being skinny, focusing on having a specific look, and always being perfect. Jeanette talks about what I described in the book, and I also highly recommend watching her interview with Drew Barrymore"]}
