That was an old tradition signalling a father giving his **property** away to another man. Nowadays, women may still do this if they want to honor a father who has done a good job raising them to adulthood and who is someone they love and respect. Your \"father\" certainly does not fall into that category, and you are not his property. If anyone asks why he didn't walk you down the aisle, just say \"That was an old tradition signalling a father giving his property away to another man, and I am not his property.\"\n\nYou also don't need to do a father-daughter dance with him. Ugh, I don't know how you would be able to stomach that. But good news, you don't need to!\n\nYou don't even need to invite him to the wedding if you don't want to.\n\nYou are NTA and I hope you will throw all those father \"traditions\" out the window and do your wedding in the way that makes your heart happy."]}
