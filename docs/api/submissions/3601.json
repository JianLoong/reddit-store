Drive an old car. And if you\u2019re lucky enough to live rent free, save every cent you can.  That\u2019s the key to financial independence.  I had student debt. Still do. Negotiated an interest rate lower than my mortgage. I pay all my monthly bills on a travel card so once I accumulate enough points I can take a trip somewhere.  But real estate is expensive and the sad reality is if you want to own property you have to stay focused on that singular goal. Home ownership will be your splurge.", "LMAO. Not a boomer.

I lost my job this September myself so I know what it\u2019s like to be stuck in a financial situation where you have to rely on your parents again.

Just eat some food\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re homeless? Just get a house\u2019.

I mean, you don't pay rent, so how on earth have you not saved enough to move into your own place in three years? I think you've both become too comfortable with the situation and you make alot of excuses (that don't really fly) in your comments. I don't blame MIL for being obviously ready for you both to move out and give her back her space.
