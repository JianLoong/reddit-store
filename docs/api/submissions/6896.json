We\u2019ve tried findMy, it won\u2019t connect, we\u2019ve turned the house upside down looking for it. It\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s lost or damaged his devices, so my mom\u2019s response caught me completely off guard. I was babysitting my brother a few days before he lost his ipad and my mom accused me of stealing it. I was shocked and laughed, pointing out that my brother still had the ipad when she returned from her errands that day. But she only grew angrier, insisting that I had it. She went into my room and made a complete mess- throwing my things on the floor, pouring out cabinet contents, quite literally turning everything upside down to try and find the ipad I supposedly stole. Like I had been telling her, it wasn\u2019t in there. She told me I had to clean the mess up, and I was starting to get upset. I asked why she was so convinced I took it, and she said it\u2019s because I \u201chave a history of doing these things.\u201d when I asked her what she meant, she brought up the time I threw away a perfectly good ipad.\n\nWhat?\n\nWhile I don\u2019t exactly remember it myself, I\u2019ve heard the story many times. When I was 5, I had gotten frustrated over a movie buffering and decided my ipad was useless, throwing it out in the trash. By the time my mom realized, it was gone. I take full responsibility for being a dumb kid, but that was years ago: I\u2019m now 14 going on 15. \n\nI asked if she really thought I hadn\u2019t matured since I was five, she yelled back \u201cYES, you clearly haven\u2019t if you\u2019re doubting me like this.\u201d She spent hours trying every punishment she could think of to get me to confess where I hid the ipad, but I told her the same thing every time: I didn\u2019t take it, so how could I know? She eventually threatened to call the police on me, to which I said, \u201cgo ahead. I won\u2019t be the one paying the fine for wasting their time.\u201d \n\nMy mom was really upset by that comment, crying on the phone for days about how she\u2019s trying her best and how I want her to be robbed of money we dont have. I feel really bad, I know she has trauma around losing money and she really wants to avoid having to buy a new ipad. My stepdad and extended family think I\u2019m being selfish for wishing that on her, but my friends think I\u2019m in the right.

Please don't let yourself believe that.", "NTA\n\nLol what? You didn\u2019t take the iPad what more does she want? You have told her repeatedly in a civil manner and she\u2019s convinced you took it.

He's a little kid. Idk, I'm so old that they'd only just brought out the pocket calculator when I was a child, so I have no idea how it is that kids get these really expensive electronics or why their parents imagine they'll take good care of them.\n\nNor do I understand how your mother got this bee in her bonnet about you taking the ipad. I guess it's easier for her than accepting it's gone for good. But you're NTA. Even the little brother is NTA, he's too young to look after something so expensive and breakable.", "NTA. Your mom sounds abusive and terrible and I'm very sorry for what she's putting you through. Accusing your child of stealing because of some crazy story from when they were five is just disgusting in my opinion as a mother. I don't blame you at all for what you said and I'm very sorry that your mother is putting you through all this drama and doesn't have trust in you.", "NTA and your mother sounds like she needs to see a psychiatrist urgently.", "NTA\n\nThat was a pretty extreme overreaction on your mom\u2019s part, even when considering the throwing out the ipad incident. She might be just a little unhinged.", "NTA. You didn't wish it on her, you stated the consequence if she falsely reported that you stole the I-Pad. It boggles my mind that your step-dad and extended family are upset about that, but not the fact that your mom threatened to call the police on her own son. That's messed up.", "NTA. She needs therapy.", "NTA: Oh Kiddo, it's going to be ok. You've done nothing wrong. Sometimes it's hard for adults when something unexpected goes wrong. If I were you, I'd speak in a manner like \"I'm so sorry that this is causing you and me so much stress.

Crying for days because of something a 14-y o blurts out during an argument is not normal. (I do not mean that you said something very terrible, OP.)\n\nIs the stepdad treating you and your brother right?", "NTA\n\nMom used a threat & you called her on it. Sounds like you need to cut ties once you come of age.", "what a GASLIGHTING woman. You should call the police on her. \"you have a history of doing this\" OMG you were 5, if we're really pointing fingers it's your mom's fault bc she should have been paying attention.

By 14 or 15, the court gives weight to the child's preference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut, I think it would have been funny had the mother called the police.  Let them come out and fine her happy ass.", "Please don't let yourself believe that.", "And, if OP hasn't matured enough in 10-years to not steal an iPad, maybe she shouldn't be asked to babysit. \nNTA", "Am I the only one that thinks OP isn't the one who \"threw away\" the Ipad so many years ago?", "It\u2019s really crazy imo.\n\nYou don\u2019t press charges on your own flesh and blood, except for if they really did some f\u2019ed up stuff", "my dad isn\u2019t in the picture, though i would have loved to see my mom actually try and call the cops hahaha", "OP if your parents make big purchases for things that aren\u2019t necessities and then you have to be frugal on FOOD, then your parents are selfish and irresponsible and putting responsibility on you when it should be on them. They\u2019re being very inappropriate. I\u2019m so sorry, you don\u2019t deserve this. But please don\u2019t think their behavior is okay. Also, there\u2019s a greater-than-average chance that your mom is behind all the missing ipads, especially if FindMy isn\u2019t working. And if your parents are genuinely worried about expensive things like iPads, they\u2019d supervise your sibling using it more carefully.", "I was a kid in the 90s/00s from an upper middle class family and there is no way I would get anything half that expensive if it didn't have any educational purpose either! I got a laptop but the (fairly cheap at the time) game CDs were always bought in moderation and one at a time. I'm really not that old but man, ~~kids~~ parents these days!", "I was thinking she sold it", "Goddamn. I'm sorry, OP. I'm not a mom but I work with kids, so hopefully I qualify to give you an honorary mom-hug... if you want one?", "I'm well aware what a false police report is. But people can file a police report and state their suspicions without it being a false report though.", "Sounds like she's upset because you are pushing back. It sounds like you are at that age where she's no longer dealing with a small child who has to do everything you are told. You are now a young teen who is presumably getting taller and not putting up with unfounded accusations. The change in power dynamics are difficult for most parents, but especially for someone who isn't used to pushback.", "How many Oxys can an iPad get you these days? Asking for a friend....", "was honestly thinking the same thing, this is a weird thing to happen twice, and the mom's reaction was insane", "Or she knows her husband did and blaming a kid is easier than facing that truth.", "I'd bet my entire bank account that she stole it to sell and use the money for something.  Flip it back on her.", "hugs are always welcome! thank you :)"]}
