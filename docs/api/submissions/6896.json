I was shocked and laughed, pointing out that my brother still had the ipad when she returned from her errands that day. But she only grew angrier, insisting that I had it.

Like I had been telling her, it wasn\u2019t in there. She told me I had to clean the mess up, and I was starting to get upset. I asked why she was so convinced I took it, and she said it\u2019s because I \u201chave a history of doing these things.\u201d when I asked her what she meant, she brought up the time I threw away a perfectly good ipad.\n\nWhat?\n\nWhile I don\u2019t exactly remember it myself, I\u2019ve heard the story many times.

I take full responsibility for being a dumb kid, but that was years ago: I\u2019m now 14 going on 15. \n\nI asked if she really thought I hadn\u2019t matured since I was five, she yelled back \u201cYES, you clearly haven\u2019t if you\u2019re doubting me like this.\u201d She spent hours trying every punishment she could think of to get me to confess where I hid the ipad, but I told her the same thing every time: I didn\u2019t take it, so how could I know? She eventually threatened to call the police on me, to which I said, \u201cgo ahead. I won\u2019t be the one paying the fine for wasting their time.\u201d \n\nMy mom was really upset by that comment, crying on the phone for days about how she\u2019s trying her best and how I want her to be robbed of money we dont have. I feel really bad, I know she has trauma around losing money and she really wants to avoid having to buy a new ipad.

He's a little kid. Idk, I'm so old that they'd only just brought out the pocket calculator when I was a child, so I have no idea how it is that kids get these really expensive electronics or why their parents imagine they'll take good care of them.\n\nNor do I understand how your mother got this bee in her bonnet about you taking the ipad.

Your mom sounds abusive and terrible and I'm very sorry for what she's putting you through. Accusing your child of stealing because of some crazy story from when they were five is just disgusting in my opinion as a mother. I don't blame you at all for what you said and I'm very sorry that your mother is putting you through all this drama and doesn't have trust in you.", "NTA and your mother sounds like she needs to see a psychiatrist urgently.", "NTA\n\nThat was a pretty extreme overreaction on your mom\u2019s part, even when considering the throwing out the ipad incident. She might be just a little unhinged.", "NTA. You didn't wish it on her, you stated the consequence if she falsely reported that you stole the I-Pad. It boggles my mind that your step-dad and extended family are upset about that, but not the fact that your mom threatened to call the police on her own son. That's messed up.", "NTA. She needs therapy.", "NTA: Oh Kiddo, it's going to be ok. You've done nothing wrong. Sometimes it's hard for adults when something unexpected goes wrong.

Just her suspecting anyone of stealing something wouldn't rise to that. In all likelihood they'd respond to the call (even THAT might a tossup depending on where you live), hear her complaint, ask you if you stole it, a search MIGHT happen with your moms consent but given she's already torn your room apart that would be unlikely. They might more likely to simply tell you two to deal with it amongst yourselves and leave. The only way your mom would be in actual legal risk is if she CONTINUALLY calls the cops about this and they get to the point where they get annoyed enough. Also, depending on location, if she kept calling 911 to get ahold of the cops, THAT might result in a fine for tying up 911 resources.
