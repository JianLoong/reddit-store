I was shocked and laughed, pointing out that my brother still had the ipad when she returned from her errands that day. But she only grew angrier, insisting that I had it. She went into my room and made a complete mess- throwing my things on the floor, pouring out cabinet contents, quite literally turning everything upside down to try and find the ipad I supposedly stole. Like I had been telling her, it wasn\u2019t in there. She told me I had to clean the mess up, and I was starting to get upset. I asked why she was so convinced I took it, and she said it\u2019s because I \u201chave a history of doing these things.\u201d when I asked her what she meant, she brought up the time I threw away a perfectly good ipad.\n\nWhat?\n\nWhile I don\u2019t exactly remember it myself, I\u2019ve heard the story many times.

I take full responsibility for being a dumb kid, but that was years ago: I\u2019m now 14 going on 15. \n\nI asked if she really thought I hadn\u2019t matured since I was five, she yelled back \u201cYES, you clearly haven\u2019t if you\u2019re doubting me like this.\u201d She spent hours trying every punishment she could think of to get me to confess where I hid the ipad, but I told her the same thing every time: I didn\u2019t take it, so how could I know? She eventually threatened to call the police on me, to which I said, \u201cgo ahead. I won\u2019t be the one paying the fine for wasting their time.\u201d \n\nMy mom was really upset by that comment, crying on the phone for days about how she\u2019s trying her best and how I want her to be robbed of money we dont have. I feel really bad, I know she has trauma around losing money and she really wants to avoid having to buy a new ipad.
