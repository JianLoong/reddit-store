Did I handle it wrongly?\n\nAbsolutely NTA. It was your birthday party, and you did nothing but tell the truth. It's not your job to cover for your sister.\n\nAnd if your sister didn't want to deal with the issues and flack from having her cat declawed, she shouldn't have done such an inhumane thing in the first place.", "NTA. Your sister is the A H for firstly declawing the cat and then secondly trying to put it on you. Your mum shouldn\u2019t have taken your sister\u2019s side in that as she\u2019s obviously in the wrong.", "Absolutely NTA. Declawing is a horrid practice, and as much as an AH your sister is, I really condemn any vet who still does this.", "YOU were getting blamed whilst the truly guilty party was blaming you as well. She is the one responsible for ruining YOUR birthday party. It was already ruined BEFORE you told them who declawed the cat. It wasn\u2019t going to get any better once they started blaming you.\n\nNTA", "i have no idea why your mother said you should have taken the blame? why would you do that? what would it accomplish? someone was going to get reamed out for harming an innocent animal, was she really so intent that it should be the person who was innocent themselves? your sister\u2026 i would have said there is a possibility she was just ignorant, not all people know declawing is inhumane, but trying to shift blame onto you makes me less inclined to think well of her. we know this; she\u2019s not a good person. nta. you did not escalate any argument. she lied, you told the truth, and then she started shouting.\n\ndid mom think that was in poor taste as well, or was it just when you retaliated that things crossed a line in her eyes? tell your mom to get right with morality and place the blame where it lies: with your sister. oh wait; mom doesn\u2019t like it when sister gets the blame. nevermind.", "NTA in the least. Especially when your sister tried to deflect any attention from herself.", "NTA, thank you for taking Puss in so he doesn\u2019t have to be subjected to your cruel sister anymore.", "You have a horrible Mom, an even worse sister (that cannot be described without violating any rules) and a shite Vet for declawing the poor cat. I hope you switched to another one. One with morals or something\u2026\nEdit: Forgot the whole point of this: NTA", "NTA. There is a line on things you keep secret for your siblings or take the blame for. Animal cruelty is so far beyond that line. If your mother thinks outing your sisters appalling behaviour is worse than the actual issue here then I think it\u2019s time to reevaluate whether her opinion is one you should value.", "The only AH here is your sister for mutilating a defenseless animal.\n\nEdit: ESH- I read your comments that you allow it to eliminate on your carpet\u2026dude\u2026get different litter, and get a box.", "NTA. You need to ask your mom why is she so eager to spare your sister's feelings and spare her the accountability, but is willing to push you under the bus for both.", "NTA. Your sister should have kept quiet if she didn\u2019t want to have an argument. And why is your mom defending her? Why should you take the blame? Sister knew or rather just learned at the gathering that declawing is bad ( at least from people\u2019s reactions rather than a humane or scientific angle)and didn\u2019t want the focus to be on her. She\u2019s the one who started shouting,you just corrected the false assumptions.", "NTA.  If anything your sister should have stuck up for you and at least tried to take your side.  What a dumb dumb she must be.", "If your sister didn't want to be embarrassed she shouldn't have lied. It's one thing for your family to assume you were responsible for the cat being declawed/lack of a litter box, however, she chimed in like she had amnesia all of a sudden. Nah. You are NTA. Your sister and mom seem like they might be though. I would have kicked them both out of my party and had a drink. Hope you can still manage to enjoy your bday.", "Declawing is literally illegal in many states because it causes scar tissue and other things to build where the claw used to be. Your cat is probably in pain or will be soon. Your sister abused the cat and tried to pin it on you? NTA scr*w your sister\n\nAnd your mom is such an AH for telling you to take the blame. We all know who the favorite sibling is now \n\nNTA", "NTA. Declawing is animal abuse and you don't want to take the blame for something you did not do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd out of curiousity: Where does your cat do his business?", "NTA. Your mother is full of shit. Your sister bears *all* the blame for this; by joining in on the attack on you and trying to make you take the blame for her cruelty.\n\nAnd cruelty it was. There's no way to remove just the claw from a cat; declawing surgically removes the equivalent of the final knuckle on each of the cat's 'fingers'. She had that cat mutilated.", "My own cat is declawed (not by us, she\u2019s a rescue) and yeah she has anxiety issues but I\u2019m super confused about the \u201ccan\u2019t use litter\u201d part\u2026declawed cats are more than capable of using a litter box so long as you take the effort to make the litterbox feel like a safe space for them. Super confused about the letting your cat piss on the floor bit. Cat piss is actually incredibly hard to clean, it seeps through under the floorboards and can actually do pretty permanent damage where you don\u2019t see it. NTA for the party situation but I think you need to maybe rethink how you handle the cat going to the bathroom.", "INFO: where does the cat GO?", "NTA I just want to thank you for taking that poor kitty in and giving it a home. Make sure your sister is on the NO ADOPTION list at every local shelter for what she did.", "Life is unfair and you have to accept it. You also need to understand that your emotional state depended on you at that moment. Making a scandal in front of many people is always a bad idea. Even when your sister has done something very insidious. The best option would be to talk to your sister one-on-one after this situation. And remember, you always have a choice, whether to be angry or not, whether to be disappointed or not. It all depends on how you perceive a situation. Just be a little selfish and start taking care of your mental health. Don't interfere in conflicts, treat the person in conflict like a child. Just smile, nod your head, and then do what you think is right. It seems stupid, but with this mindset, you will feel how much easier it will be for you to even breathe in this world.", "Nta\n\nYour sister is an animal abuser. Stay away, people who hurt animals are likely to become violent towards humans at some point.", "NTA. You had no choice, but to tell the truth to your family.", "ESH. I don't think you should ever have to take the blame for someone else. How can we learn from our mistakes if we don't admit to them? However a shouting match isn't going to solve anything and generally makes the rest of the room uncomfortable. You could have all dropped the subject at that point and talked again in private later.", "NTA. Why would you have to take the blame for it? You were already kind enough to take the cat. She decided to declaw the cat it's not your job to take other people's opinion on it. Your mom, though, wow. Let her learn her lesson. You're pretty nice, really because if it were me, halfway through your argument, I'd probably use the \"it's my birthday\" card \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "NTA. So your sister is cruel to her/your cat, has the audacity to lecture you on pet care, lies in front of your friends, and your mother thinks it is your fault for not taking the blame? What a problematic family dynamic. You should try to keep your distance for your mental health, What if one day your sister commits an actual crime?", "A cat can\u2019t use a litter box if declawed? And who the fuck declaws a cat in 2023", "NTA, your sister joined in on telling you off? You have every right to stick up for yourself rather than just keep the peace as your mum wants. Good on you, don\u2019t be a doormat", "NTA. She was the one who did it. Why would you cover for her, when she even joined then telling you off.", "\u2026so you just let your cat shit and piss wherever it wants? That night be more disgusting than declawing a cat.", "Eww! I just assumed it was using the human toilet. That's revolting.", "I tried the paper litter but it didn\u2019t work. Is there something even softer than that?", "It sounds like mom is all about appearances and getting in a shouting match in front of others is a bad look in her opinion.  I am sure she would have rather it not come up at all but I don't know any of these people this is just my guess.", "This. Animal cruelty is never ok.", "I want to know who allowed the sister to declaw a cat ?", "On the floor in my living room. I just clean my place very often.", "If her sister wanted a one-on-one convo she should have kept her mouth shut. Why are you encouraging OP to be a doormat simply because that's what you would do? \"Smile and nod\"...Uh I think tf not. Especially when I'm being lied on, on my birthday. That's ridiculous. Kudos to OP for actually having a back bone.", "So op should\u2019ve taken the blame for something the sister did after the sister tried to act like it was op who did it to it was ops birthday y should it be ruined by the sister", "Hurts the paws:(", "I have a rescue that was declawed.  Still uses the litter box.", "Sure, an animal peeing and pooping is worse than actual animal abuse. Please never own pets.", "I know right nothing smells worse than the cat taking a dump somewhere other than it\u2019s litter tray!", "Only in my living room at my own place and I always clean up thoroughly, especially when expecting someone. I use baking soda and vinegar to deal with the smell.", "Google I\u2019ve lived with cats and paper? Wtf", "Go to the vet, ask there for recommendations. There\u2019s many kinds of litter. Obviously the clay litter is too rough, and perhaps the paper litter is not to your cat\u2019s liking. Cats are very particular. Trial and error my friend. Don\u2019t allow eliminations outside the box, you\u2019re teaching it that it\u2019s ok to ruin your house. Cat pee doesn\u2019t come out like you think it does. It may be gone from the surface level of the carpet, but it seeps into the wood/flooring underneath and before long you\u2019re looking at not only re-carpeting but also redoing the floor.", "Would sand work? You could probably get that from the hardware store. Or the shavings (wood?) that you often see in the bottom of rabbit hutches etc.", "WHAT", "Bruh \ud83d\udc80", "Like on a pee pad? Or just straight floor \ud83d\ude33", "\\*vomits*", ">If her sister wanted a one-on-one convo she should have kept her mouth shut.

Kudos to OP for actually having a back bone.\n\nThose who blindly go along with provocations become the footstool. Being strong means finding the best solution despite your emotions. Or do you think that the OP should be like a dog that runs after a stick and gets picked? To see weakness in controlling yourself and using the situation to your advantage is bllsh#t.", "I think you're confused about my meaning. I'm not sure how you got to this interpretation of my comment because it's very much the opposite.", "I guess I never thought about it because I would never declaw a poor cat\n\nThat\u2019s insane to me lol", "Traditional litter yes. Wood pellets are a very good option here because they can be dampened to sand consistency.", "Stumps. Declawing is the same as cutting off the final knuckle from each finger.", "Yay for rescue pets!", "I didn\u2019t say worse, i said more disgusting.", "ESH. There are alternatives to regular litter.  I'm guessing you rent, so why would it be a problem if the cat pisses and shits all over someone else's property. Grow up and learn how to take care of the cat properly or give it to someone that will.", "Nah cant grt rid of the smell of cat pee its gross and rots stuff.", "What. The. Hell?! That is disgusting. You are neglecting that cat if they don\u2019t have a designated and clean place to do their business. You can\u2019t actually be serious that you are allowing a cat to pee and poop wherever they want. And cleaning it up before company comes over isn\u2019t a solution. How do you get the smell out? Your place must reek!!", "Cats will go out of their way to hide their shit and piss, that\u2019s why they burry it in sand in the first place. I guarantee that you are not finding all if it.", "Use puppy pads. They are very soft on the paws, waterproof, and disposable. Your cat will soon learn that that\u2019s the best place to go and you can stop having a soiled carpet.\n\nOther than that, NTA.", "Soo...telling the truth is blindly going along with provocations? If you're non-confrontational good for you. Everyone else isn't like that nor should they be. If someone is lying on my name I'm gonna check 'em. Period. It's not about emotions. I can very calmly tell someone they are lying and present the truth. Why does OP have to \"control themselves\" when they are literally being lied on? And why is not addressing public disrespect your version of self-control? Did OP say she put her hands on anyone? No. So they seemed pretty self-controlled to me. Tucking your tail and having a \"private conversation\" when someone disrespected you intentionally in public is not something I call strength. If anything the sister needs more self-control. Because when she got called out she started screaming. But whatever floats your boat.", "Imagine how confused(and in pain) the poor cat is :(", "Alright. You think an animal peeing and pooping is more disgusting than actual animal abuse?", "You guessed wrong. I don\u2019t rent. I own my house and live alone. Only property affected is mine.\n\nAnd the paper litter doesn\u2019t work, so unless there is something softer?", "I use baking soda and vinegar. Works quite well.", "Tomorrow morning I\u2019ll go to the pet shop and buy pads.", "I can wrap my head around people declawing a cat. I might find it vile, but I know how awful cat shit and piss smells; it\u2019s some godawful abominable miasma of filth that lingers in the air and in your tongue when you are around it.\n\n That makes me want to vomit.", "Absorbant pads or rags inside the litter tray instead of actual litter?  That will make it infinitely easier to clean up and be more hygienic.", "Have you tried pee pads, like for puppies? It's just an absorbant mat so won't irritate the kitties toes", "I\u2019ll buy some pads tomorrow morning.", "I\u2019ll be buying some pads tomorrow."]}
