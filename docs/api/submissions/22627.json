I can very calmly tell someone they are lying and present the truth. Why does OP have to \"control themselves\" when they are literally being lied on?

The vet may put your cat on low-level anxiety meds to help it recover.\n* Get catnip and spray/sprinkle it around friendly areas for the cat like bedding and where you want it to live (not poop/pee!).\n* Get a cat pheromone diffuser like Feliway (plug-in or spray around the house). This will lower the cat's anxiety levels overall as it heals.\n* Get some gentle scratchy items like cardboard scratching floor pads. They will help the cat begin to reacclimate to using its feet (even declawed) after healing.\n* Immediately get a litterbox and put it in a designated area -- a side room, bathroom, enclosed garage, basement, etc.\n* Experiment with litter types. Ramp up gradually. So start with puppy pads in a litterbox for a few days to a week. Change them constantly. Once it has peed/pooped there for a week or so, start adding a layer of soft or paper litter to the top. Keep changing the pads/litter. Start adding more litter. Etc.\n* After it is reliably using the paper litter on top of the puppy pads, you can stop using the puppy pads and just use the litter in the litterbox, cleaning it frequently.\n* Try to move on with the introduction of other litter types.\n* If the cat isn't using the litter, buy cat litter attractant (you can find it online in a ton of places) and sprinkle it on top of the litter every time you clean/change it.\n* Reward the cat and pet it and give it treats when it uses the litterbox and you witness it doing so. Reinforce the good behavior.\n\nI hope this helps.", "After being declawed, using the litter box can hurt their little paws. Declawing can mangle their little feet, and leave them in pain for life.

Nature's Miracle does an excellent job of neutralizing the odor over time, but it has to be treated and retreated.\n\nOnce you've allowed cat pee to sink into carpet, carpet fibers, carpet padding, wood, and even porous stone and ceramic tile, it's IMPOSSIBLE to get it out permanently... especially since they keep using that same spot over and over and over again.   \n\nWhatever the cat is using as a \"litterbox\" is now ruined and will eventually need to be replaced.   \nNo matter how often you treat it.  \nA cat's sense of smell is like 1000x better than a humans is, so even if *you* believe the spot no longer smells, the cat will continue to be able to smell it, and they will always be inclined to pee in that exact same spot again.", "My childhood cat was declawed and she was fine for the first seven or so years of her life, but at around 8 she stopped using the litter box. My mom tried everything but she would not use it. It was only within the last 4 years (my childhood cat passed in the mid 2000s) that I found out some declawed cats eventually stop using the litter box because the litter causes them pain and they start to associate the box with pain.", "This should be higher. That's good advice.", "Or chronic constipation. I had a Siamese that refused to drink water after another cat pushed her in the toilet. She also refused wet food. Dry kibble only. Poor cat was literally shitting rocks.  She'd pee in the litter box, but not poop.

But it sounded to me like op just got the cat? They haven't had a chance to figure out what to do", "This is my first thought too. I have a cat that will only poop in the litter box occasionally and we're not 100% sure why. We put puppy pads down near her box while we're to figure out what we need to do to get her back to pooping in the box full-time, and she will poop on those rather than the floor.", "That was my assumption too. That she either made it a catio, or has it in diapers or some type of alternative to work with the cats issues.

Your sister is horrible and your mother isn't any good either. It really shows who is the favorite. Please keep taking care of your cat and take into consideration the advice given by all the amazing people here. But also please keep standing up for yourself.

Only innocent are sacrificed while keeping the peace.", "The claws don't grow back. Just like our fingers don't grow back if you cut them off. But yes, it can be quite painful for them.", "Not using the litter box is a very well known potential side effect of declawing. If it heals poorly, declawing can cause holes in the paws, and it's very irritating when litter gets into them. So the cat stops stepping on litter.\n\nNot every declawed cat will have litter box issues but it can definitely cause it!", "This. After our last move, my cat decided that a stretch of the carpet in the living room was where she was going to mark. It's a horrifying smell, but no amount of begging, bargaining or positive reinforcement has been able to convince her to stop.

I had no idea that was a thing. I feel awful now! I loved that cat so so much!", "I've heard that declawing is the equivalent to cutting a human finger off at the 1st knuckle.

I worked in vet medicine and they claws can and sometimes do begin growing back after they're removed. Generally it happens when the entire claw wasn't removed which really comes down to the skill and experience of the vet performing the procedure. It's a big reason WHY the procedure is banned. You should do some research on the issue first, it's actually really common it happens in like 30% of cats along with other post surgical complications from declawing.\n\nIdeally they don't grow back but that doesn't mean they don't unfortunately and it causes alot of litterbox issues for them afterwards.", "My boyfriend actually had the tip of his finger cut off at the first knuckle bc of a firework accident! He\u2019s been declawed and THE RECOVERY process was crazy. He went through a lot of physical therapy to even use his hand again. Cats don\u2019t get that same treatment and it\u2019s crazy that they\u2019re forced to walk on nubs", "Declawing for cosmetic or behavioral issues is bad but don't shame all vets who do it. \nRare Exceptions do exist where it is necessary. My sister had a cat with very elastic skin.  We had to declaw her back legs because the high elasticity made the cat shred her neck whenever she scratched behind her ears.  It looked like the cat had been viciously attacked. The declaw was necessary or we risked the cat's life.\n\nSorry for the anecdote. I just like folks to know there are medical reasons for declawing. \nMy family has not declawed any of our other cats and I think we've had a combined 10 since that lovely weird kitty left us.", "Yes declawed cats also experience this! Declawing is a form of amputation after all.", "I am so glad that where I live a vet declawing a cat would not only lose their license but charges would be pressed against vet and owner for animal cruelty. Same btw. if owners would take a cat to another country to get it done there.", "You didn\u2019t think to remove the carpet?", "I couldn't believe it either. Idk why it never crossed my mind before but last year I learned they do it to lions and tigers in zoos too \ud83d\ude1e", "At least you won't have to worry about fertilizing them.", "Hi I'm a vet. It is amputation if the first bone with the claw. So imagine the tip of each finger being cut off. Definitely amputation.", "That's amputation. Removing part of a limb is still amputation.", "That's still amputating part of the body...", "It's barbaric.", "That is exactly what it is. You can't just remove the nail/nail bed. The toes are amputated at the last joint.", "Have you tried walking barefoot on gravel?", "Tell me about it! My partner got his middle and ring finger caught in his motorbike chain, 9 years ago. The hospital tried to reattach them but in the end had to remove his ring finger down to the next joint due to tissue necrosis. He still has phantom itches, pins and needles and when it gets cold they hurt. We call them the nubbin' and FF (fixed but fucked).", "It makes sense. My kitty does the same, especially when he tries to use the litter box. His shoulder area twitches like he's trying to paw the litter.", "The other comment I made today that's getting replies is about me being a woman with a wife so my brain jumped to other interpretations of this comment before I saw the context. But yes, those plants were auto fertilized.", "r/sinkpissers", "I highly recommend getting a good scratching post. Every time the kitten starts to scratch, pick it up and stick it on the post (by the claws, they're sharp enough to act like velcro. Do not use glue.). There is a pretty good chance he'll learn that's where to scratch. Give him a treat when you shift him and the likelihood will increase.\n\nMy cat is 15 and has gone through five scratching posts and no furniture since we did this when he was four months old (we had no expectations it would work, so it was a very pleasant surprise!).\n\nI'm in the UK so a) declawing is not a thing and b) he's an indoor-outdoor cat and also scratches any wood in the garden.", "I had a cat who would get mad when I went on a trip so when I got home she would very deliberately poop next to her litterbox. \n\nNot while I was gone as a form of protest of a full litterbox mind you, after I got back.", "His accident happened in Nov 22\u2019, his main thing initially was heat/cold but it\u2019s gotten less sensitive!

It\u2019s meaningless if done when you aren\u2019t there to be inconvenienced by it. It must be done when you are there, to witness the displeasure, the disrespect, and so they can see you having to clean it up.

Evolutionarily humans have huge ass muscles compared to like, all other creatures on the planet since we are the only animals that walk upright. These huge muscles forfeit the ability to have a \u201cself-wiping ass\u201d like gorillas or other primates, causing shit to get stuck. But big TP is still a scam!
