Not inviting family for no good reason is not normal in many cultures. I don't understand British culture, though I will say, Welsh, English (north and south) and Scottish are very different, it seems some norms to them clash so much with what I know and those countries are only next door!", "I'm in Aus too and it must be an American thing to think that way because most cultures consider weddings very important. It's a day to celebrate with your loved ones so if you don't get invited it means you're not a loved one or someone they care to share the biggest moment of their life with unless there's a particular reason they explain beforehand like budget, just wanted close family, limited seating etc. Not even just a wedding, if you found out your friend or family member was having a party and was told everyone else in your social circle was invited but not you, you'd be pretty bummed out and wondering why. To say \"I can invite whoever I want and don't anyone a reason\" is just rude and a way to end relationships going forward.", ">\n>the aunt isnt entitled to be upset about his snark - he is entitled to respond how he believes is reasonable.\n\nWhat? She has sent invites out to her wedding and OP questioned it once and then had the bad manners to bring it up again only 3 months from the wedding. OP even says they weren't nice about it and makes it clear they've brought it up to other people which creates unnecessary drama. Of coruse she has a right to be upset. Honestly the worst part about planning a wedding is other people and their expectations. OP isn't entitled to be rude at all. What a strange take.", "I'm not a man. \n\nIt would be useful if OP could respond to the queries asking if any other nephews or nieces were invited. It may be the case that the aunt considers children of her siblings as, children. I've seen this interpretation at weddings here in Ireland so it may be the same in the UK. Also, I think you're far too hung up on the excuse she gave for not inviting OP. They weren't invited so OP is an AH for pressuring the aunt for an invite. It's that simple.", "I mean yeah but you\u2019re telling me you\u2019ve been snarky ever?", "I can change it to attitude if that is better.", "Yeah and someone pointed out that maybe the relationship I had with her wasn\u2019t a good as I thought which is fair but I at least have the same relationship as they have with her, and we\u2019ve had no prior arguments or anything like that just a Normal relationship", "No", "I know idk why, it is what it is I just kinda wanted an actual reason", "Nah man is something people say even to women, it's just a turn of phrase.\n\nOP would be the ah if no one younger than them was invited, but if they are, it's kind of obvious aunt's excuse is bs.", "I don't get the point you are making, I guess.\n\nOP said he was snarky to the aunt. I don't care if someone is snarky, but not everyone likes that. The point was that the aunt may be just be being polite to OP by saying the the reason he isn't invited is age when it is totally possible there is another reason, like say, maybe she doesn't actually like OP's snarkyness.  It may also be that she defines adult differently.", "I've never called a woman 'man'\n\n\n>OP would be the ah if no one younger than them was invited, but if they are, it's kind of obvious aunt's excuse is bs.\n\nWhere did OP say younger people were invited?", ">Where did OP say younger people were invited?\n\nOP didn't say that, but some people have asked for info.\n\nSorry you're so offended about a phrase.", "Do you live under a rock?\n\nWere you perhaps born after, say, 2015, so the pandemic interrupted the development of your socialization and reading comprehension?", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrelft/comment/ivtyaeh/", "Op has now clarified below that people younger than them have been invited.", "Instead of being incredibly ignorant you could answer the question.", "Thanks for linking but OP posted those clarifications after my and other people's questions. I said to OP it would have been useful to know that information in the original post."]}
