Same with them, they can hate you but they will not risk the talk of others if you were not. One of my partner's cousins only offered two invites per set of cousins, so my partner and his sister are the only cousins through aunty p, so they and their partners got invites, aunty h had five kids so only two got invites, aunty U had four, only two invited, you get the gist, it is still being spoken about 15 years later how no one can comprehend what slight took place to make that call. Not inviting family for no good reason is not normal in many cultures. I don't understand British culture, though I will say, Welsh, English (north and south) and Scottish are very different, it seems some norms to them clash so much with what I know and those countries are only next door!", "I'm in Aus too and it must be an American thing to think that way because most cultures consider weddings very important. It's a day to celebrate with your loved ones so if you don't get invited it means you're not a loved one or someone they care to share the biggest moment of their life with unless there's a particular reason they explain beforehand like budget, just wanted close family, limited seating etc. Not even just a wedding, if you found out your friend or family member was having a party and was told everyone else in your social circle was invited but not you, you'd be pretty bummed out and wondering why. To say \"I can invite whoever I want and don't anyone a reason\" is just rude and a way to end relationships going forward.", ">\n>the aunt isnt entitled to be upset about his snark - he is entitled to respond how he believes is reasonable.\n\nWhat?

OP even says they weren't nice about it and makes it clear they've brought it up to other people which creates unnecessary drama. Of coruse she has a right to be upset.

You asked reasonable questions about the why you weren't invited.  i don't consider two contacts over 3 months to be anywhere close to causing stress (unless she felt guilty).  And I'll agree with others here that the most likely reason is your sexual orientation.  Now you have free stress-free day for yourself instead of a wedding :)  Best of luck to you.", "I like those, post pictures with a caption about being such a child. Whatever you do make sure you let people know SHE didn\u2019t invite YOU so she doesn\u2019t make it seem like oh, who knows where he is, he didn\u2019t want to come or something.", "Sending a catalog for his and his, hers and hers, super large sex toys might be funny ... unwrapped and ask someone to keep it on top of the pile. like send 20-30 so as they get moved a new one shows up... super petty tho.", "Yeah I\u2019d agree apart from the questions being weeks apart and the questions being different, also I hope she doesn\u2019t view two reasonable questions as bullying because that\u2019s just sad in my opinion\ud83d\ude05I\u2019ve left it for over a month, literally not spoke to her and she\u2019s been texting me saying I\u2019m still stressing her out despite me not even talking to her?", "Huh? I\u2019m completely fine with the explanation and of course I don\u2019t want to embarrass or win\ud83d\ude05what I don\u2019t understand is that because it\u2019s someone\u2019s wedding you can\u2019t voice your opinion about something? She also never gave a reason and I\u2019ve clarified multiple times in comments that I absolutely don\u2019t want a family drama and have even told family members to go when they said they wouldn\u2019t because she\u2019s being unreasonable", "She lied about the age reason because you put her on the spot.  She does not like you.  Whether it is because you are bi or you've clashed before, she doesn't want you there and it's her prerogative.  It's your prerogative to never speak to her again and tell your sister and family that are going, when she actively lied and excluded you, to chose a side. If you were my child and my sister excluded you, she would be dead to me.", "Angry? Lmao annoyed about how bad the grammar is in nearly every reddit post? And a lot of the OPs are in college or uni....", "You don't even know me. Because I think that it's annoying to read post after post with bad grammar doesn't make me an AH. You however are an AH.", "Nope, if you all don't mind reading post after post where the majority of the posters start with me and \"Jim\" which shows how bad the education system is, then bully for you.\n\nI just would like you all to write like literate people, not asking a lot.", "Sorry I don\u2019t spend all my time making sure a little Reddit post isn\u2019t to the proper Oxford dictionary standards lol", "I agree it doesn\u2019t make you an AH however you also don\u2019t know OP, maybe they only have one hand or have arthritis or something lol, ask them go on", "Why do you have to be so rude about it tho, does this seriously affect your life in anyway? No? Move on then", "You do you, ignorance is bliss, apparently.", "They have responded to me and apparently they're fine with the post, so it's all good for them...\ud83d\udc4d", "Rude? Saying please fix something? Wow, I can imagine if someone looks at you in a way that you don't like you'll cry.... You're telling me to move on ...lmao \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "Rooting for your immediate family to not attend.", "Reply to my Dm then\ud83d\ude02", "I didn\u2019t respond to you at all wtf\ud83d\ude02", "I call bs", "Respond to his Dm then", "Me too! I sure as hell would even if it was a beloved sibling", "\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "Really? So your DM wasn't a response? Good to know.", "No one cares", "Why?", "Just want a conversation lol and stop lying, didn\u2019t reply to you saying anything was good lol", "No it was a question haha, asking for a conversation and never said anything was good even if it was a response it never said anything was all good", "He replied saying you lied lol sooo", "Because I\u2019m Almost 100% certain you and him could have cleared up this misunderstanding instantly in a Dm conversation but you refused to even try, obviously wanting to argue haha"]}
