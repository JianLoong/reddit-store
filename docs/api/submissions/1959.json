You asked to make sure there wasn't a mistake, you were told by the person hosting and paying for the event that you weren't invited. If you had left it at that then your aunt is a bit of the AH but you don't get to badger someone to be invited, especially to a wedding. You have a decent not necessarily close relationship. Maybe you feel slighted but are you actually hurt? It's your aunt's right not to invite you.", "NTA\nYou're not a child, she just doesn't want you at her wedding.

There is obviously another reason she does not want you there and she should have told you or your parents. \n\nHowever you did not need to be snarky and if you are always like this perhaps this is the reason you were not invited.", "YTA\n\nYou're not invited stop harassing her for an invite.", "ESH\n\nYou're not a child and she shouldn't have said that. She doesn't want you at her wedding. Not sure if this is her excuse or if she legit feels that way.\n\nBugging her about it IS childish though. You asked, she made it clear you weren't invited.

LOL) but in the States, no children usually means no one under 21 (drinking age)\n\nRegardless, yes you are an asshole for \u201csnakily\u201d pestering her about the invite. Asking once would have been acceptable. Asking again is the asshole move.", "Esh. She's a jerk for calling you a child and you're a jerk for still bringing it up. She clearly doesn't want you there.

Do you really want to go to a wedding that you weren't wanted at? So the snark is you showing her you're mad. Why? All it does in her head is cement you aren't mature enough to be at her super special wedding. Leave it alone and let the fact that she's being ridiculous speak for itself because I promise you when people ask where you are and she snottily replies 'This is a no children wedding\" everyone does their own math and she looks bad, not you...unless you continue snarkily bugging her about it.", "NTA.  \nYour aunt has shown you what you mean to her, unfortunately.

And if being asked if her nephew is still a child on his 45th birthday is how it goes then so be it.

They don't deserve to be \"called out or questioned\" about it or called an asshole. There's clearly a reason why OP isn't invited and sounds like the aunt was trying to be diplomatic in why they weren't. OP even says they've had disagreements in the past so obviously there's more to the story."]}
