It's a day to celebrate with your loved ones so if you don't get invited it means you're not a loved one or someone they care to share the biggest moment of their life with unless there's a particular reason they explain beforehand like budget, just wanted close family, limited seating etc. Not even just a wedding, if you found out your friend or family member was having a party and was told everyone else in your social circle was invited but not you, you'd be pretty bummed out and wondering why. To say \"I can invite whoever I want and don't anyone a reason\" is just rude and a way to end relationships going forward.", ">\n>the aunt isnt entitled to be upset about his snark - he is entitled to respond how he believes is reasonable.\n\nWhat? She has sent invites out to her wedding and OP questioned it once and then had the bad manners to bring it up again only 3 months from the wedding. OP even says they weren't nice about it and makes it clear they've brought it up to other people which creates unnecessary drama. Of coruse she has a right to be upset. Honestly the worst part about planning a wedding is other people and their expectations. OP isn't entitled to be rude at all. What a strange take.", "I'm not a man. \n\nIt would be useful if OP could respond to the queries asking if any other nephews or nieces were invited.

The point was that the aunt may be just be being polite to OP by saying the the reason he isn't invited is age when it is totally possible there is another reason, like say, maybe she doesn't actually like OP's snarkyness.

I just really don\u2019t get how asking twice in 3 months just for her to tell me why makes me such an asshole?", "I hope that\u2019s not the reason and I agree I\u2019m not invited that wasn\u2019t what annoyed me I just wanted to know why, but I hate this idea that because it\u2019s someone\u2019s wedding no one else is entitled to any sort of explanation on anything", "I\u2019ve accepted I\u2019m not going I don\u2019t know why people think I haven\u2019t\ud83d\ude05what bothers me is she openly lied to my face, surely I\u2019m entitled to at least know why? But guess not because it\u2019s a wedding?", "Ah right okay I get that, thank you for actually explaining that instead of attacking me as I had no idea that was a thing haha", "But lying about the reason why isn't right. \"No kids\" doesn't make sense when younger cousins and OP's younger sister is invited. \n\nNothing wrong with asking for the real reason (betting money its her homophobia!).", "So am I an actual asshole? Or just in the wrong in this situation?", "I asked her twice in 3 months just to simply explain and that makes me an asshole? I\u2019m not texting her constantly but she obviously lied and if she just simply doesn\u2019t want me there than that\u2019s fair but as a human I\u2019m entitled to at least know why", "Actually, you know what? Now you *should* start bullying her.\n\nPoint at someone in a graduation gown and ask her if this *small child* should be accompanied by an adult? Point to teenagers driving alone in cars and ask your aunt incredulously \"When did they start giving licenses to *tiny children*?\"\n\nYou'll be justifying her decision to leave you out of her wedding, but hey, you were never going to get that invite anyway.\n\nOh! Even better! If you ever have another family event where she would show up for something of yours, make sure to let her know that geriatric elderly people aren't invited so.. you know.. obviously she can't come since she falls into that very broad age group and you're sure she'll understand.", "Don\u2019t waste your breath. I know you want the upper hand in this situation and to prove a point but it\u2019s not worth it. Your aunt has made it very clear that she\u2019s a bigot. If your other cousins (younger and older) have been invited and you\u2019re absent, questions will be asked and she\u2019ll look like the asshole she is all on her own. Go out with some friends, have fun and post pictures with a saucy congratulations in her honour instead.", "She doesn't like you because you are bi-sexual.  Just go LC to NC.  You know where you stand with her.", "Just think, you don't have to worry about a gift.  But if it makes you feel any better, next time you have a big accomplishment going on and sending out invites, remember not to send her one and when she calls be like, \"Toxic Aunt's are not invited\" or something.", "To be clear, your aunt is a small-minded bigot and a coward. \n\nHer fiance or his family (forgive me for assuming she is marrying a man /s) may be even more ~~conservative~~ small-minded than she is, and she doesn't want to \"risk\" them finding out her family tolerates such non-conformity.\n\nBut there's no reason not to tell you the truth.  Her \"stress\" is due to her trying to keep her lies and justifications straight.", "You are not crazy! And it\u2019s completely human and reasonable to want to know why! \n\nSadly the most likely answer is often the right one, so it seems very likely it\u2019s because she\u2019s homophobic. This might also be why she doesn\u2019t want to admit it. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, you deserve better, at least honesty.", "From an outside perspective and judging from your comments here, the most likely reason is homophobia. \n\nRegardless, your aunt is a massive AH. Excluding one relative out of 5 within similar age range is incredibly rude no matter the reason. \n\nGiven that she disapproves of your sexual orientation, I don\u2019t think it would be surprising if this is the reason she doesn\u2019t want you attending. Just sucks that your family isn\u2019t sticking up for you. Hopefully they will remember this and support you when you cut your aunt out of future life events.", "I think you are entitled to know but that doesn\u2019t mean you are ever going to know for sure. \n\nThat said I think it\u2019s entirely fair to infer that she\u2019s biphobic and that\u2019s why you aren\u2019t invited especially if your lil sister is invited. I would 100% talk openly about it with your family. Don\u2019t say that she said so, just say you still don\u2019t understand why you classify as a child when people younger than you are going including your sister. I guess Aunt is biphobic, that\u2019s the only reason I can think of \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f because I\u2019m certainly not a child.\n\nIf like her children are invited though and you and your other cousins aren\u2019t that\u2019s a different story and is probably more about numbers. It may not be just about kids but about where they are in relation to her family. \n\nBut yeah if all your other adult cousins are invited, that\u2019s a different story and would def casually start a rumor that she\u2019s biphobic if you are so inclined and the opportunity presents itself.", "Why, it's her wedding. She doesn't have to explain her guest list, YTA", "Newsflash: Your aunt doesn\u2019t owe you an explanation or reason or anything. If she doesn\u2019t want you at her wedding, that\u2019s her choice. You aren\u2019t entitled to her answer. Move on with your life.", "I understand that, but you\u2019re not. I would have recommended asking around her, rather than directly. Brides can get a little crazy.", "I don't know, are you an asshole?", "Why would she even expect a wedding gift from OP? You usually only bring a gift if you\u2019re invited to the wedding.", "Not sure if you saw it, but OP clarified that he's bi, aunt doesn't like it, and aunt has invited cousins younger than OP.  Aunt is just your garden variety chickens\\*\\*t homophobe, too cowardly to say it to OP's face.  She deserves to get roasted.\n\nOP, you have your answer.  Sorry it's a sucky one, but you do have it.  Do with that what you will, and don't feel bad whatever you decide.", "Yeah that\u2019s a good point haha", "Yeah he's bi and she disagrees. Cousins younger than him are going. I just wonder what her reason is?", "[removed]", "OPs younger sister was invited", "Sorry meant not bothered but I think when she claims it\u2019s about being a child and then invites younger and is openly not happy about my sexuality I don\u2019t think asking for an explanation makes me an asshole, I\u2019m not telling her I\u2019m coming and she\u2019s wrong lol", "So now I\u2019m the asshole?", "I don\u2019t think so, I think I\u2019m at least entitled to know why she lied? Wouldn\u2019t you want to know aswell?", "My favorite thing about substitute teaching was when the kids made art for me or brought me pretty flowers they found at recess. I\u2019m back at my main gig teaching college composition this semester and I do miss that!", "Unfortunately there are those that expect a wedding gift because they're:\n\nA relative\n\nA friend of the family \n\nA childhood friend \n\nSomeone that was spoken to on the 32nd day of the 13th month at the 25th hour\n\n\nNTA", "Except that you don\u2019t know that, you\u2019re just assuming it. The aunt might have plenty of other reasons to not want OP there that have nothing to do with her orientation. None of us have a full picture of the situation.", "It's probably the reason you think it is.  I'm sorry.\n\nWhen people ask you why you weren't there, \"Aunt wouldn't tell me, and I can only think of one reason....\"", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

All you are doing is allowing yourself to be a doormat. Your parents and sister should not attend because this is not only offensive to you, it\u2019s offensive to them", "It would be great if she would have not lied and told you the actual reason, but it's her day.  Also, she is letting you know by her actions she doesn't value you in her life, which may be hard to understand why but it's her decision and if I were you I would believe her and move on in my life without her.  Sorry to be so blunt, but I am much older than you and have dealt with a lot of people and have learned to let them go if they do not being joy to my life.", "No it should be 'Bisexual children don't give presents to homophobic adults'.", "Or her future in laws are and she cares more about appeasing them than she cares about OP.", "I wouldn't do that.  I would ghost her. And ignore her when I saw her.", "Oh damn, that's just cruel. I understand that you're closer with some siblings and therefore with their children, but this is not the case.", "Yeah fair enough you make a strong point, can\u2019t argue with that", "> so I assumed it was that ngl\n\nIt's because OP is Bi.... He thought they were fairly close for aunt/nephew otherwise.", "I\u2019m American, and it\u2019s expected that if you invite the cousins, you invite all the cousins. If you invite your mom\u2019s sister, you invite all the parents\u2019 siblings.  If you have \u201cno kids\u201d, the cut off is usually young adolescence, with the kids of bride and groom, or maybe their younger sibs, and those in the bridal party excepted.  In this case, I bet it\u2019s homophobia.", "Honestly, I think your immediate family should boycott the wedding and just not go.", "I agree. An aunt Inviting only one of two of her nieces who are sisters to each other is seriously awkward in the first place. Inviting only the younger sister and then telling the older sister she's excluded due to not being old enough is way beyond merely awkward and into family feud territory. OP's sister and parents ought to feel a duty to stand up against this by refusing to attend."]}
