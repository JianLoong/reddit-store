I specifically asked for it as a gift from my Mother, and I chose this one because it\u2019s a similar kind to one my boyfriend and I have enjoyed playing together in the past. It was a fun small gift, but one that meant a lot to me as a couple\u2019s activity. I\u2019ve been saying I wanted us to play this together for months, and we were both really pleased that we received it as a gift. \n\nWe\u2019ve been staying with his family since Christmas Eve, without our games console, so haven\u2019t been able to play it yet. We\u2019re going home for New Year\u2019s, and my plan was that our NYE activity would be to play this game as we have no plans to go out, especially as we\u2019ve had no quality time alone over the festive period. \n\nTonight, he went to hang out with a friend who still lives in his hometown. I stayed in with his parents. When he got home, I asked if he had fun and what he got up to, and he told me that his friend had just got the game, so they played that. \n\nI\u2019m really angry, and told him that he\u2019s just robbed me of the joy of getting to play this together for the first time now that he\u2019s played it with his friend. To me, it feels like he opened OUR present with his friend, and because he\u2019s already played it, it\u2019ll no longer be a special couple\u2019s experience. It\u2019s also not like this is the only thing he could have done with his friend, the friend has loads of games and would have understood if BF has said \u201cactually, I want to save that to play with my GF because we received this for Christmas as a joint gift\u201d. He thinks that because he\u2019s only played the first few levels and it\u2019s just a small game, I\u2019m overreacting, even when I told him it\u2019s much more than that to me - he spends a lot of time playing games with his friends which I\u2019m glad that he enjoys, but it often gets in the way of us spending quality time together. This game that I wanted to play as a couple, when I don\u2019t play many games, was my way of finding something for us to do together that we\u2019d both enjoy.

You weren\u2019t asking for a lot, he could\u2019ve easily played another game with his friend.\n\nIdk how people are saying YTA, when your boyfriend didn\u2019t take your feelings into consideration at all.  What part of a healthy relationship is that?", "OP, ignore everybody saying Y T A. Switch out the video game with a TV show, and everyone would call him an asshole for watching the show without you, even though you already had plans to watch it for the first time together. \n\nPeople are just hung up on it being a video game because they don't play them and view them as a childish hobby. \n\nNTA", "Yta", "Info: was he aware of your plan to play it for the first time together on NYE? If your expectations weren't clear, I think you're better off letting this one go. You'll still get to play it together and it'll still be special. It's not worth a fight.\n\nETA: since you communicated this to him clearly and he played it with his friend anyway, NTA.", "INFO: I personally feel like all the yta votes are from people who've never played games before. Was the game intended to be a story rich experience (like it takes two) or was it some other multiplayer game where the story is not the primary concern for the game? If it's a story rich game where the story IS the game, I have to say hard nta, especially considering he knew you wanted to play together beforehand. If the story isn't that central to the experience, I'd have to go with a ***very*** mild ESH for you. Getting worked up about a game that he played without you when it's not a story based experience is a little weird, but he's still an AH for reneging on something he knew you wanted to do as special bonding time.", "NTA. It might seem trivial and sure it's \"just a game\" but it was meant to be a bit more than that for your first play together.", "NTA\n\nIt's something you were supposed to first experience together, he made a choice that he can't undo, now you don't get to experience it for the first time together. I think it makes sense that you're upset, he was being inconsiderate.", "[deleted]", "It's a video game", "For real?  Playing with his friend won't take away enjoyment from playing with you.  This does seem like an overreaction.  YTA.", "YTA. Im understanding your bfs friend had also just acquired the game and wanted to play with your partner. Now expecting him to reject his friends offer and tell him thats its a game saved for you and him is a lil too much. His friend was just hanging and maybe was just as excited about it. By the sounds of it your control over this whole experience is making it sound like you\u2019re sucking the joy out of the experience.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Is him playing it with the friend going to spoil the experience of the two of you going through it together?", "Thanks for your input. I think the reason I feel so upset is because of the lack of consideration he showed really. It\u2019s more than just about the game.", "People who don\u2019t play video games should just not respond to this. \u201cI don\u2019t like video games and think they\u2019re for kids so you\u2019re an asshole for wanting to play one\u201d is a terrible take, the post isn\u2019t about you", "It's the equivalent of wanting to watch a TV show for the first time with your spouse. If he started the show without her, he'd be an asshole. So OP is 100% NTA. Her age is irrelevant.", "I don\u2019t think my age needs to come into it in relation to it being a video game. That\u2019s not what you\u2019re here to judge. Different things are important to different people and video games are important to us. As I\u2019ve said, the main thing I was upset about/the reason I don\u2019t think he should have done it, was the lack of consideration of my feelings. I\u2019d have felt the same if he\u2019d gone to see a move with a friend that he\u2019d promised he\u2019d go with me to, or if we\u2019d been given gig tickets to use together but he\u2019d gone to see the band with a friend first instead without checking with me if I minded first.", "Thank you. I understand what others are saying, but it\u2019s nice to hear someone say I\u2019m NTA because of his lack of consideration for my feelings", "He was, yes", "This was 100% what I was thinking.\n\nThere's even a comment criticizing her for playing video games because she's 27, as if video games are only for children \ud83d\ude44", "It was a gift to both of us", "You're a video game", "Tell me you don't play games without telling me you don't play games", "So you think it's fine to watch through a show you were suppoded to watch with your partner as a couple's activity with someone else instead?\n\nDo you think it'd be okay if they had reservations together at a restaurant they'd both never been to and then he decided to go there with his friend the day prior?\n\nSome people like to first experience something new with their partner as a bonding activity, when this is a plan that you have, it's really inconsiderate to go do it with someone else without your partner.", "This is my question as well. Why is the game title not mentioned yet, as it would provide context to if it is a story game versus Call of Duty multiplayer.", "[deleted]", "I love video games and play them all the time, with my partner. There just comes a time in life where you don\u2019t sweat the small stuff.", "In that case, I think he's probably TA, and I understand why you're upset. But I think you're only punishing yourself if you let this ruin your NYE plans. It sounds like he's still excited to play with you. Let yourself feel disappointed for a little bit, but then let yourself have some fun.\n\nIf he has a history of ignoring your plans and not considering you, that's worth thinking some more about. But if this feels like a fluke, I think it might just be one of those things that you might as well let go.", "yea like, how out of touch do you have to be? 10 bucks says they can barely use a computer outside of the internet and don't know how to unzip anything", "[deleted]", "NTA. This isn\u2019t a situation where mind reading is required. She was visibly excited that she got to share this experience with him, especially because it\u2019s an activity that he enjoys and she wants to share. Playing that particular game with a friend when she was sitting at home waiting for the chance to finally get to be a part of that facet of his life is a slap in the face. As a gamer I would be ecstatic if my gf proposed a game we could play together, something we could share. He completely blew it", "Thank you, this is really helpful. I think we\u2019ll still play tomorrow night, but we need to have a talk about his history of not considering me in plans etc because that\u2019s where the real issue lies.", "Surely a joint gift is to use together? But I don\u2019t think you understand - it wasn\u2019t technically our gift he used. He used his friend\u2019s copy of the game. It was the * meaning* of our gift that he used by playing it with someone else before me. Like I said to someone else, it\u2019s like being given tickets to see a band with me, but then going to see the band with someone else beforehand so the moment isn\u2019t as special for us anymore, without checking with me first.", "I think that's really sensible and I wish you luck. It's tough to feel like you can't rely on your partner to consider you, especially when you weren't even asking for something unreasonable or difficult. I hope you have a productive conversation. \ud83d\udc95"]}
