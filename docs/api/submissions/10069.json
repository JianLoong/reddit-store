If he's even considering it, and he tried to pull this, your dad is going to be hell to live with after 18 if he isn't already.", "Wow NTA. You paid for it. If your dad makes you leave because of this it says more about him than it does you. Sorry that you are going through this. It\u2019s not like you sold the old system for the new one. Wow.", "NTA, your parents are controlling and not respecting your ownership of the product you bought with your own money. And your dad is threatening to kick you out of the house as soon as you turn 18? I don't know of any resources for this situation but you should really try to piece together some support system and work on becoming as independent as possible.", "NTA - but your dad seems more offended at your lack of obedience to his will", "Wasn\u2019t this exact scenario posted before?", "NTA as you are free to do whatever you want with the PS5 you purchased. Your father is just angry that he wasn\u2019t able to force your decisions here, and his reaction really showcases some temperament and control issues to put it lightly.", "NTA, sorry.   Talk to your guidance counselor at school.  They may help with options.", "NTA.  You buy something with your money, it\u2019s yours.  If your parents want a contribution toward home expenses, they clarify that first.  You had a good solution with handing off the PS4 so they would get more time with it.  Your dad doesn\u2019t share all of his possessions equally\u2014do you jace the same access to his car as he does\u2014on some sort of rotation?  Dad\u2019s especially mad as you outwitted his unfair demand.  But you had the absolute right to first keep it for yourself and then to also return it.", "This sounds exactly like another AITA post from awhile ago.", "INFO\n\nIf the PS4 was shared between all the kids, why was it going in your brother's room? Don't your sisters get a look in? Where was the PS4 before you moved it?", "You are nta, but if you thibk he wants to kick you out start reaching out to better family for help, since a parent that does that for petty reasons doesnt deserve to be one", "Absolutely NTA!\n\nIt was your PS5 that you paid with YOUR money. No one else besides you is entitled to it. Start making your exit plan now and save money so you can move away in case they do end up kicking you out", "NTA- wow. I'd be looking for rooms to rent just in case.  But that was something you bought, it was yours not your siblings. They had access to the PS4 if Dad wanted them to have a PS5 he can go buy one.", "this is a life lesson for you and you took the right path. \nDad should've pitch in with half since this is something that would've brought joy to all his kids. NTA", "NTA. If your dad is trying to come across like a toddler throwing a tantrum he\u2019s doing a bang up job! He\u2019s acting out because your siblings are likely whining to him about and rather than just tell them the truth (that peoples things are their own and they don\u2019t have to share) he would rather take his frustration out on you and use what power he does have to make you miserable til he can kick you out..which might be an empty threat to try and scare you into getting another one.

You could have offered to share sometimes at your discretion, but that would have been your decision alone.", "Nah bro, that\u2019s fine you paid for it they have to right to it.", "NTA I read this as a parent resenting their kid hitting an age of independence and not liking the realization that they aren\u2019t the absolute authority anymore.  He wanted you to obey and when you said no and were able to execute on it\u2026yeah. I hope they don\u2019t kick you out, but I suspect things won\u2019t exactly be comfortable at home even if they let you stay.", "NTA", "NTA--you were completely in the right.

He can buy them their own ps5 now.", "JFC your dad wants to kick you out for disposing of your own property? It\u2019s not like you left your siblings without a PlayStation, they\u2019re in the same position they were before you bought the new one. Your Dad sounds controlling AF.\n\nNTA, and I hope you won\u2019t be forced out on the street (what a lovely birthday present!), but if I were you I\u2019d be planning to get out as soon as you can find and afford somewhere else. Save that PS5 money and put it towards your tenancy deposit elsewhere.", "NTA \nAs a parent, I have allowed my 2 older children (18now and 10) to purchase games and consoles. I've told them it would be nice if you shared, but not required. They both have said it's not fair that they get to play (insert game name here) and I don't. I just tell them to buy their own.", "NTA. It was yours, bought and paid for by you. You should have never been asked to share the PS5. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong, especially with the PS5. Don\u2019t feel guilty because there\u2019s nothing you did wrong!", "NTA Lowkey dad just wanted to play on your account and trash your fortnite  k/d, and you out maneuvered him", "NTA at all. If you refused to ever let them play on it *with* you, that would be a bit of an AH move, but expecting you to share it equally is not reasonable.", "Nta. \n\nThere's things that you can control as a parent and things you can't. \n\nYou earned yourself something.  I don't think you should even have to share. However, your dad's within his rights to force sharing if it's in his house.........\n\n\nI honestly feel like you made the mature decisions both on the ps4 and returning the ps5. Your dad's a major ass for feeling like you owed your siblings anything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then got grounded from using your own device you paid for and was grounded again because you took it back? That's obsessive, and practically bullying at this point. NTA.

Just leave as soon as possible.", "NTA. I have a beef with parents who force kids to share delicate items with younger siblings who may not realize how fragile (and expensive) consoles and gaming equipment can be. Some kids can understand fragility and some can\u2019t. Also It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d to them. YOU bought it with money YOU saved. You make the call on who gets to use it.
