They're teachers who had large aspirations of making it big only to end up in some Podunk HS program directing low budget shows. It's a power trip, and as an educator they should be striving to do better.", "NTA.  If I were your mother, I\u2019d be on the phone demanding to know who thought these assholes had any business working with children.  Not that what they\u2019re doing would be good or effective in a professional setting, either, but at least you\u2019d be compensated.", ">\" maybe I'll replacements will have more enthusiasm.\" \n\nKid, I like you.\n\nNTA", "I need some context.

NTA", "Ahhh high school theater, all the drama is behind the scenes. \n\nInfo: Was there a need to speak to everyone\u2019s behavior? Were people actual disrespectful?", "Similar thing happened to me in high school theatre. Our director really cracked down to the point where it wasn't fun anymore. Our average cast size dropped from 40 to closer to 20. It was depressing. Sometimes high school theatre teachers forget it's not broadway and the main point of these shows is to have fun. NTA. You may be young but you are correct and they need a reality check.", "INFO when did they say useless?\n\n>but if they think anytime we question anything or bring up our own ideas it's disrespectful.\n\nWe need examples. What was said, when, and to who?\n\nTeenagers don't always think disrespectful things are disrespectful esp in a very friendly environment like theatre. What I mean is there could easily be lots of joking around that is inappropriate or inappropriate at the time.", "I'm conflicted between NAH and ESH.\n\nIf you (and the company) plan on making theatre a life goal, this is what it's like: it's a cut-throat business, and you need the hide of a rhinoceros to make a career out of it. Your teacher may be preparing you for the challenges you'll face.\n\nIf this is supposed to be a fun-filled, extracurricular activity for everyone involved, then both your teacher and you were out-of-line.", "Sort of TA, but only due to inexperience. Changing your mindset is key here. Just because you landed the role doesn\u2019t mean you ever really stop auditioning for it. You may have been the best at the time, but there is always someone who may have a different interpretation of the role that may suit it better. By letting the apathy set in, unfortunately you\u2019re only proving their point. Show them they made the right choice every time you perform.", "While I appreciate your snark and can\u2019t deny that I would have probably said that exact same thing when I was in high school it wasn\u2019t the right way to make things better for you and your cast mates. Sadly, being told that you were replaceable was the most real world communication you are likely to receive from a high school staff member and instead of figuring out that means you can kick it into high gear or kick rocks you and you decided to miss the lesson because you didn\u2019t like how it felt. You were wrong here, funny but wrong, and if you were an adult it\u2019s unlikely you would have a part still. \nYTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I assume there was some justified reason for the respect lecture, but it sounds unlikely that your high school director could replace the whole cast. Your quip was snarky and maybe a little disrespectful, but since you weren't replaced it sounds like you didn't cross a red line. Break a leg!", "Ugh.  Could be worse, one of the theater kids I went to high school with in a small city wound up being a local cop, instead.  At least theater directors don't have arrest powers and qualified immunity.", "I used to go to a school with a special theatre program, which was pretty cool actually. However bitterness ran deep there, most of the teachers just wanted to do anything stable related to theatre so they ended up there. They take themselves very serious and expect you to share their live and enthusiasm for the arts while also wanting to prepare you for the real world where this live for theatre won\u2019t get you anywhere. \nThat being said I completely understand where the teacher\u2019s opinion is coming from, however it\u2019s not suitable for a normal high school. Nobody really giving a shit about what they do is a bitter pill to swallow.", "From what I had observed I didn't see any behavioral issues", "For example on of our actors was asking about adjusting his costume to make it more comfortable to move in and the three detector took his out of the room and lectured him about it for 30 minutes, or when we bring up ideas for our characters movements on stage our main detector gets very mad telling us that it's not in his staging plan and spends like 10 minutes yelling about us asking if we can change how we walk across stage.", "They said we were useless during a scene where a kid needs to go to.be like seven feet tall so she was supposed to sit on a kids shoulders but the kid almost passed out, so they put her on a pair of wheels and she almost fell of the stage.", "NTA.
