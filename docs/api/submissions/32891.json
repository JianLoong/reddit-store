I always go all out for my family because I love watching them enjoy the holiday. One of my favorite things to do is take my nephew (10m) and my nieces (7f and 4f) to a Christmas farm. They have a petting zoo, restaurants, pictures with Santa, and the\nkids love it. This year when I asked my former SIL when a good weekend for me to take them would be (her kids are 10m and 7f. 4f has a different mom), she said they wouldn't be going this year. I was a little hurt, but I said okay, and moved on. I took my youngest niece, we had a blast. Former SIL finds out and gets mad telling me I shouldn't have taken their half sibling and not them, I reminded her she told me no. A few days later I asked her when I could come by with their Christmas gifts, and she told me I could drop them off next weekend. I asked her what she meant, and she said I wasn't welcome to watch them open their gifts since \"4f is obviously more important to me than they are\" and I told her that's not true, and wouldn't be dropping off their gifts unless Iwas welcome to stay and watch them open them. If she didn't want me to come over there, I did offer to bring them to my place.\n\nEdited to add: my brother has passed away, she's the only connection I have to them. Our relationship was fine before my brother passed, and she acts the same way towards my parents (the kid's grandparents) now. We went from spending days at a time with the kids to seeing them twice in the past 8 months, because she no longer allows it.

First, gifts are gifts. No one is entitled to what you choose to do for them. Second, take a moment to Investigate if there is current drama going down between the parents. If you and your SIL weren\u2019t already on the outs, something has her feathers ruffled enough to cause issues", "I find this starts when the SIL tells you not to take the kids.  She didn't want you to take ANY of the kids.  She didn't mention that, but, you know, of course she didn't, because then she'd have a reason to be upset with you. \n\nShe didn't want you to take a kid she has no custody of or biological relation to. Which says to me, she's got a problem with the 4 year old's baby mamma, and was trying to punish her through this.   Either way, she's punishing the kids for the perceived slights of the adults.  I don't know what she thinks you've done wrong (other than the farm trip), but she sounds like a handful of drama. \n\nSo basically I think there's something else going on.   Is she pushing out other relatives?  Or is everyone else \"toeing the line\"?  What did she say when you reminded her she told you NOT to take them?  Did she play dumb?  Did she say something like \"you should have just known\"? \n\nTo me, it sounds like she's trying to find problems, to either isolate the kids from all of you, or to set a precedent for being more demanding later. \n\nI'm gonna go with NTA, because you've offered ways for the kids to get presents.  She doesn't want to have you at her celebration, fine.   I would still find a way to get the presents to them, if it were me.  Like, through another relative or something.  If that's possible.", "INFO: \n\nHave you tried to have a conversation with your SIL that's not about the kids recently? \n\nIt sounds like your brother passed eight months ago; that's still pretty fresh. Even though they were divorced, that's a huge paradigm shift for the family. She had to transition to being a full-time single parent while grieving and that's a lot. Do you know if she's doing okay? Have you tried to check in on her and ask about her? Have you tried having a face to face conversation about how your two families can relate to each other now that the primary link between you is gone? \n\nI know a bunch of people here see her actions as aggression and are advocating for aggressing right back.

Send the gifts, even if you can\u2019t watch them open then, and write a note to each child enclosed within the gift, telling them how much you love and miss them.\n\nWatching them open the gifts is about what you need.  Sending them gifts no matter what their mother does is about putting them first and keeping that connection alive.\n\nESH, but you just a teeny bit, because I really do understand your frustration.  I just think you\u2019re in danger of punishing the wrong people.", "NTA - I'm not sure what game your former SIL is playing, but she's only hurting the kids here.", "Hm. Obviously she is being super petty here but where is your brother in this situation? I assume she is your ex SIL as she was your brother's wife? Can he play any role in facilitating a relationship with them? It's time to stop trying to coordinate through her.\n\nIt's sad that she'd use her kids as pawns to punish a loving and caring aunt. I encourage you  not to similarly take her shittiness out on them. It might burn a bit to send them gifts with her absurd rules but just try to keep in mind - your ultimatum punishes them as much or more than it punishes her, and could possibly damage the relationship with them if she chooses to twist it when talking to them about you. So ESH, her way more than you but I just think your ultimatum was a bad direction.", "Do what you want but realize that she holds all the cards if you ever hope to see the kids.\n\nI wonder if some of the story is missing that would explain why she\u2019s gone from seeing tour parents regularly to seldom.  Might want to investigate to see if your parents oversteped their bounds.", "NTA, but you're getting even with her by punishing yourself.\n\nWhat is your *goal* here?  Is it to be right?  Is it to bring about \"true justice\" by showing her that if she's a nasty person *her children* and *you* will have consequences?  Or is it to be able to spend time with your niece and nephew?\n\nIt's like chess; look at every move you could make and consider what the likely long-term result is going to be.\n\nYou are absolutely justified in saying you're not buying the kids gifts if you can't watch them open them, both so you get the pleasure from it and so they know it's from you.  You bet.  But if you do that, how do you see things playing out?  Do you think she will see the error of her ways and come to you hat in hand to beg you to forgive her?  Or do you think she will tell the kids you didn't get anything for them this year as a way to distance them from you?\n\nIf you buy the gifts it may end up the same way.  She may say they are from her.  She may still cut off contact.  But, then again, she may not.  You may still have some contact with them. The older they get, the harder it will be for her to break that contact.  And if she does still cut them off, when you look them up in 10-14 years or so, and they think you're the one that went away, you can ask if they remember the (whatever it is you bought) back in December 2023 and tell them it was from you.\n\nSo, again, you're justified in pulling the plug.  But if you want the kids in your lives you may have to eat a little sh\\*\\* to make that happen for a few years.", "I think you need to start thinking long term. There is a good chance your relationship will never get to be close at all. \n\nWhen my brother divorced I went from seeing my nephews once a month to 3 times in 15 years. His ex made it super difficult for our family to see them and my brother didn\u2019t seem to care anymore about maintaining our relationship. It was hard and I didn\u2019t know what to do, tried for 2 years. But eventually I stopped asking to see them and now I don\u2019t even talk to my brother as he really didn\u2019t care about us after the divorce just his new girlfriend. \n\nNow the kids are adults. And it\u2019s so awkward I had nothing in place to show them I never stopped caring about them. There is nothing there to try to build a relationship on other then blood. \n\nSo I wouldn\u2019t cut them off and fingers crossed it\u2019s short term. But make sure you send something.

Honestly just be the bigger person and give the kids presents, you can then tell them when they're older how their mom behaved.", "NTA, I would sit her down and ask her, seriously, why she is mad that you did something with your other nibling after she shut you down. Does she want you to spend time with the kids? You are trying to spend time with them, you want to be present in their life, and you thought you were respecting her by not pushing with the zoo.

Is it a relatively new thing? \n\nHas the mum suddenly been placed under loads of new extra demands by family for visits or photos yet obviously now she can\u2019t tag team/co parent so she\u2019s now the 100% there every second with no break parent and family want to just swoop in for the odd bit of fun not actual help?

As far as gifts go , if OP wants to see them opened and mom says no, then that\u2019s that.", "She's their mom, she's always invited, and any day before or after Christmas would be fine. In our family we only do Christmas day with the people inside our home.", "No cheating from anyone, their divorce was finalized before 7f was even born. I have invited just her 2 kids out to do things, but I don't think she's interested in us seeing them under any circumstances, unfortunately.", "Oh my, I am sorry. \nWhen my uncle died, the cousins I had grown up with and their mother basically vanished from the family completely. It\u2019s unfortunate but apparently really common and will likely fall mostly to you to maintain the relationships until the kids are old enough to make their own choices", "See if your parents are willing to go to court for grandparents rights in place of your brother.", "I understand your hurt but the kids aren't going to. They've lost their father. Their mother is busily cutting them off from the rest of their father's family. Don't let her lure you into turning the kids into pieces in this nasty game. They deserve better. Give them presents because you want them to have the presents, not for your own entertainment or personal satisfaction. Put a little letter inside each parcel saying how much you love them and that you're thinking of them. Merry Christmas.", "That leads me to think that something happened between your parents and her that none of them are telling you.", "I don\u2019t usually advocate for this because it\u2019s very often misused, but this is exactly the situation that grandparents/family rights are intended for. Your family needs to sue for visitation time with these children. These sorts of rights are to maintain an already established relationship and you obviously have one.", "\u201cAs far as you know\u201d.  I\u2019d ask her and let her know that you\u2019re not part of any drama between her and your parents.\n\nNTA for how you feel about the presents, but I wouldn\u2019t punish the kids over it and would drop off the presents.", "It is absolutely fair for the Step-sibling to go. Why should she miss out just because SIL said her kids can\u2019t go?", "Grief can make people act really strange and completely unlike themselves. She is very likely dealing with a lot of emotions that she doesn\u2019t know how to explain or process. \nI\u2019m going to go with NAH because the situation is complicated and sensitive. \nDon\u2019t punish the kids because mom is lashing out in grief. Drop the presents off, and maybe try and find a compromise and have SIL send pics or videos of the kids opening them. \nShe may be struggling and trying to protect her kids (in entirely the wrong way) since it\u2019s the first Christmas without their dad - but doing it wrong doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not doing it with good intentions. \nWhen grieving, I shut down, and sometimes I can be short and snappy. I don\u2019t intentionally do it, and it\u2019s something I\u2019m in therapy for, and working on actively. \nMaybe offer to bring SIL coffee - outside of the Xmas stuff, and just sit down and be present. \nOne of my good friends will literally show up at my door with his husband just to give me a hug when he senses I\u2019m shutting down. Normally, I hate when people show up unannounced, but he is the exception because he only does it when I\u2019m self isolating and shutting down because of some major turmoil in my life. I don\u2019t know if you and SIL are close enough for you to do something like this. But it really helps me feel less alone and feel wanted and loved. The fact he never gives up on me when I\u2019m doing this means the absolute world to me.", "Yes little kids opening presents is magic. Could she just video it for you?", "That makes the gifts about you.", "Aah, I'm sorry for your loss. That seriously makes it hard. She sounds really  unreasonable and hard to work with. All I can say is to try to keep your head above the fray and don't be baited into playing her games.", "You refer to her as former SIL. Did your brother divorce her before his death?", "Sorry to say, but they will never be coming over for Christmas again, as any Christmas gathering will be at her family, being that she is the only surviving parents and there is no need to split the day anymore (her family gatherings will always come first now).  \n\nI would let her know that that day is her\u2019s alone, and that you only request that they come by for Christmas Eve or Boxing Day (if those don\u2019t conflict with her family).  And also let that be known to your parents so that they don\u2019t push too far (which is likely why she\u2019s already distanced herself and the kids from them).", "So is she saying no to that, or just to you doing a by yourself stop by", "So sorry, I just realized that I read this as 7f, 4f, and 10m ... With your nephew only being 10 months old. I have a weird cousin situation like that and after the second breakup mom of the oldest and youngest got really weird about the middle kid (not hers) in ways she never had been before. I think I need to have another cup of coffee! So sorry for my mistake. \n\nHonestly, I have a weird family situation sort of like this, and the kids remember even if you don't get to watch them, or their mom's being weird, and it will pay off when they turn 18. Also as some people have been suggesting, your parents should have rights, and it would be worth seeing a family lawyer about.", "Do you think she was just tolerating everyone before? Have you tried to have a conversation with just her to find out what has changed? And maybe specifically asked what has changed? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she felt minimized in some way with regard to her role in his life during the funeral/end of life gatherings. It\u2019s easy to miss things like that when you\u2019re navigating grief, so you may want to check in and be prepared to apologize for intended slights. The only reason I recommend this for your situation is for the best interest of the kids. I don\u2019t think this is a good time to dig in your heels about who is right and who is wrong.", "Look, hard as this is, things have changed. She may simply be being petty here, but equally, she is well within her rights to say she doesn't want you coming over to watch her kids open their gifts. You acknowledge that you and SIL have drifted apart; that's just how it goes sometimes, but if you want a relationship with those kids, you gotta work with her. Maybe ask her what would help her instead of assuming you can simply do the things you always used to do. Personally I'd drop the gifts of as she suggests, make it clear to her that I'm keen to make her life easier, rather than saying 'well I'm not doing it your way'.", "Gotcha. \n\nI think you need to sit down with her and have a real discussion about the role you play in their lives and how to support her and the kids as a link to their paternal side.", "Omg thanks", "Yeah, this happened to me with my stepsibs, who I absolutely adored. Their father died and their mother, who loathed my mother, gave us virtually no access. I got to see them once a year until they turned 18. All I could do was communicate what I could when I had those opportunities.", "This is the specific case where \"grandparents rights\" actually do apply.", "Is grandparents rights even a thing??", "This the answer \u2b06\ufe0f", "Or the brother and OP\u2019s former SIL", "If they\u2019re in the US the grandparents have no visitation rights as courts have steadily overturned those laws in States where they existed due to the Supreme Courts ruling in Troxel v. Granville.", "I will ask her if there's any drama with my parents. If there is, I definitely want no part of that!! And I will end up dropping off the gifts.", "I offered FaceTime, videos or, pictures if she didn't want me to be there, she said it was putting a burden on her and giving her another chore.", "Yes, they were divorced.", "Yes, I wasn't expecting to be with them Christmas day. In our family we only do Christmas day with the family that lives inside our house. She does know I mean any day she and the kids are available.", "She doesn't want me to stay and watch them open gifts, take them to my house to do it, and I told her if I dropped them off I'd want videos and pictures but she said that'd just be a chore.", "No it\u2019s nephew (10 male) and nieces (7 female, 4 female). The 7 year old and 10 year old have the same mother and the 4 year old has another mother.", "Except that the Federal Courts overturned several State grandparents visitation law so grandparents have no rights to see the kids if the parents don\u2019t want them to.\n\nAs the only living parent, their mother has full control.", "Yes, but usually only after the death of a parent. The courts will step in if they feel the remaining parent isn't allowing sufficient time to the deaceased family's parents. There had to have been a relationship with the granparents prior to the death for the rights to be established as I understand it.", "In some places, yes.", "Its a thing in some states in the USA, but most people don't understand the limitations.\n\nGenerally, a claim for grandparents rights requires:\n\n* a pre-existing relationship with the grandkids\n* a death or divorce of the parents\n\nStories on Reddit usually involve people incorrectly thinking that grandparent rights is a bludgeon to force a relationship or dictate how the grandkids are raised.", "Especially for cases like this. This type of situation is what the law were made to fix.", "Not in the US as the courts have tossed those out saying they unconstitutionally interfered with parental authority.", "All 50 states have some variation of a grandparents' rights law.  Grandparents are not guaranteed access; they have to show the court that it is in the best interests of the child for them to have continued access.", "Possibly.  Either way something happened.  OP needs to let the mother know that she\u2019s not part of any of that.", "You\u2019re like a broken record on this post. Do you practice family law in the state OP resides in? Likely, no, so please stop commenting this over and over again.", "Maybe ask your *parents* first? Then see what your former SIL says when you ask if everything's cool.", "I would just give the gifts but it sounds like something else is going on.
