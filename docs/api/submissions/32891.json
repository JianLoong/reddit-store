I always go all out for my family because I love watching them enjoy the holiday. One of my favorite things to do is take my nephew (10m) and my nieces (7f and 4f) to a Christmas farm. They have a petting zoo, restaurants, pictures with Santa, and the\nkids love it. This year when I asked my former SIL when a good weekend for me to take them would be (her kids are 10m and 7f. 4f has a different mom), she said they wouldn't be going this year. I was a little hurt, but I said okay, and moved on. I took my youngest niece, we had a blast. Former SIL finds out and gets mad telling me I shouldn't have taken their half sibling and not them, I reminded her she told me no. A few days later I asked her when I could come by with their Christmas gifts, and she told me I could drop them off next weekend. I asked her what she meant, and she said I wasn't welcome to watch them open their gifts since \"4f is obviously more important to me than they are\" and I told her that's not true, and wouldn't be dropping off their gifts unless Iwas welcome to stay and watch them open them. If she didn't want me to come over there, I did offer to bring them to my place.\n\nEdited to add: my brother has passed away, she's the only connection I have to them. Our relationship was fine before my brother passed, and she acts the same way towards my parents (the kid's grandparents) now. We went from spending days at a time with the kids to seeing them twice in the past 8 months, because she no longer allows it.

First, gifts are gifts. No one is entitled to what you choose to do for them. Second, take a moment to Investigate if there is current drama going down between the parents. If you and your SIL weren\u2019t already on the outs, something has her feathers ruffled enough to cause issues", "I find this starts when the SIL tells you not to take the kids.  She didn't want you to take ANY of the kids.  She didn't mention that, but, you know, of course she didn't, because then she'd have a reason to be upset with you. \n\nShe didn't want you to take a kid she has no custody of or biological relation to. Which says to me, she's got a problem with the 4 year old's baby mamma, and was trying to punish her through this.   Either way, she's punishing the kids for the perceived slights of the adults.  I don't know what she thinks you've done wrong (other than the farm trip), but she sounds like a handful of drama. \n\nSo basically I think there's something else going on.   Is she pushing out other relatives?  Or is everyone else \"toeing the line\"?  What did she say when you reminded her she told you NOT to take them?  Did she play dumb?  Did she say something like \"you should have just known\"? \n\nTo me, it sounds like she's trying to find problems, to either isolate the kids from all of you, or to set a precedent for being more demanding later. \n\nI'm gonna go with NTA, because you've offered ways for the kids to get presents.  She doesn't want to have you at her celebration, fine.   I would still find a way to get the presents to them, if it were me.  Like, through another relative or something.  If that's possible.", "INFO: \n\nHave you tried to have a conversation with your SIL that's not about the kids recently? \n\nIt sounds like your brother passed eight months ago; that's still pretty fresh. Even though they were divorced, that's a huge paradigm shift for the family. She had to transition to being a full-time single parent while grieving and that's a lot. Do you know if she's doing okay? Have you tried to check in on her and ask about her? Have you tried having a face to face conversation about how your two families can relate to each other now that the primary link between you is gone? \n\nI know a bunch of people here see her actions as aggression and are advocating for aggressing right back. But if you haven't already tried the compassionate approach, there's no reason not to start there first.", "NTA...Former SIL is obviously suffering from lingering bitterness of some form and is taking it on you.", "Is SIL going to take credit for your gifts?

Send the gifts, even if you can\u2019t watch them open then, and write a note to each child enclosed within the gift, telling them how much you love and miss them.\n\nWatching them open the gifts is about what you need.  Sending them gifts no matter what their mother does is about putting them first and keeping that connection alive.\n\nESH, but you just a teeny bit, because I really do understand your frustration.  I just think you\u2019re in danger of punishing the wrong people.", "NTA - I'm not sure what game your former SIL is playing, but she's only hurting the kids here.", "Hm. Obviously she is being super petty here but where is your brother in this situation? I assume she is your ex SIL as she was your brother's wife? Can he play any role in facilitating a relationship with them? It's time to stop trying to coordinate through her.\n\nIt's sad that she'd use her kids as pawns to punish a loving and caring aunt. I encourage you  not to similarly take her shittiness out on them. It might burn a bit to send them gifts with her absurd rules but just try to keep in mind - your ultimatum punishes them as much or more than it punishes her, and could possibly damage the relationship with them if she chooses to twist it when talking to them about you. So ESH, her way more than you but I just think your ultimatum was a bad direction.", "Do what you want but realize that she holds all the cards if you ever hope to see the kids.\n\nI wonder if some of the story is missing that would explain why she\u2019s gone from seeing tour parents regularly to seldom.  Might want to investigate to see if your parents oversteped their bounds.", "NTA, but you're getting even with her by punishing yourself.\n\nWhat is your *goal* here?  Is it to be right?  Is it to bring about \"true justice\" by showing her that if she's a nasty person *her children* and *you* will have consequences?  Or is it to be able to spend time with your niece and nephew?\n\nIt's like chess; look at every move you could make and consider what the likely long-term result is going to be.\n\nYou are absolutely justified in saying you're not buying the kids gifts if you can't watch them open them, both so you get the pleasure from it and so they know it's from you.  You bet.  But if you do that, how do you see things playing out?  Do you think she will see the error of her ways and come to you hat in hand to beg you to forgive her?  Or do you think she will tell the kids you didn't get anything for them this year as a way to distance them from you?\n\nIf you buy the gifts it may end up the same way.  She may say they are from her.  She may still cut off contact.  But, then again, she may not.  You may still have some contact with them. The older they get, the harder it will be for her to break that contact.  And if she does still cut them off, when you look them up in 10-14 years or so, and they think you're the one that went away, you can ask if they remember the (whatever it is you bought) back in December 2023 and tell them it was from you.\n\nSo, again, you're justified in pulling the plug.  But if you want the kids in your lives you may have to eat a little sh\\*\\* to make that happen for a few years.", "I think you need to start thinking long term. There is a good chance your relationship will never get to be close at all. \n\nWhen my brother divorced I went from seeing my nephews once a month to 3 times in 15 years. His ex made it super difficult for our family to see them and my brother didn\u2019t seem to care anymore about maintaining our relationship. It was hard and I didn\u2019t know what to do, tried for 2 years. But eventually I stopped asking to see them and now I don\u2019t even talk to my brother as he really didn\u2019t care about us after the divorce just his new girlfriend. \n\nNow the kids are adults. And it\u2019s so awkward I had nothing in place to show them I never stopped caring about them. There is nothing there to try to build a relationship on other then blood. \n\nSo I wouldn\u2019t cut them off and fingers crossed it\u2019s short term. But make sure you send something.

Honestly just be the bigger person and give the kids presents, you can then tell them when they're older how their mom behaved.", "NTA, I would sit her down and ask her, seriously, why she is mad that you did something with your other nibling after she shut you down. Does she want you to spend time with the kids? You are trying to spend time with them, you want to be present in their life, and you thought you were respecting her by not pushing with the zoo.

Is it a relatively new thing? \n\nHas the mum suddenly been placed under loads of new extra demands by family for visits or photos yet obviously now she can\u2019t tag team/co parent so she\u2019s now the 100% there every second with no break parent and family want to just swoop in for the odd bit of fun not actual help?

A grandparent will not win by proving the grandparent will be harmed if he or she is denied access; they must show harm to the child.  If you are a lawyer, you'll know judges often decide what they think is best and then frame their decision in a way that supports that decision.  If a judge in GA thinks a child ought to have continuing contact with grandma or grandpa, the order is going to say the child is harmed by not having that continuing contact.  If a judge in GA doesn't think it is in the best interests of the child, the order is going to say the judge's hands are tied because there is no showing of actual harm.
