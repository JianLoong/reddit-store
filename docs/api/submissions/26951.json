Are you in school as well? If she wants to negotiate more reasonable rent, you could do that.", "NTA, you don\u2019t owe her anything, if you can live rent free, do it. I\u2019d be happy to see my adult child strike out on their own.", "NTA, you have to do what you have to do. It honestly kind of sounds like your mom is trying to force you to move out.", "NTA. If you continue to live in your mother's house, you will likely need to keep paying rent, but you might be able to negotiate with her by showing her paystubs, so she understands she's taking a huge portion of your income. $800/mo for a room in your childhood house is bonkers to me. \n\nNow, if you have a place to move into that will not charge you rent so you can save up to move out, I would do so - and soon. While more info might be helpful, it sounds like you and your mother already have a strained relationship (her talking bad about you, what mother talks shit about her own son who works and pays rent?!) It might ease some of that strain if you moved out. Sure, she may be upset at the loss of income at first, because if she's not working, you are a source of income for her. \n\nJust make sure you have a good savings for a couple month's rent before moving out on your own, and look for a better job as you are able.", "INFO - are you able to talk with your mom as two adults, or is there a lot of yelling, \"because I said so\", guilt tripping, etc.? \n\nIt does not sound like a healthy relationship with your mom. \n\n> I\u2019m trying to save up so that i can afford to move out soon\n\nI don't understand your post. You are trying to move out either way, whether she charges you $200/week or $0.  Once you move out, you are in the same position as the reason you think you might be the asshole:\n\n>because i would not being paying rent leaving her in a tough situation\n\nThat's going to happen sooner or later, either way. Looks to me like your choices are:\n\n* leave things as they are. If you are lucky, you'll eventually manage to save enough money to move out (and you'll stop paying her rent leaving her in a tough situation)\n* stay somewhere else for free, letting you save up money for apt and car sooner (and you'll stop paying her rent leaving her in a tough situation)\n* talk to your mom, change the rent structure to something reasonable, save up money and move out (and you'll stop paying her rent leaving her in a tough situation)\n* live with your mom forever and pay her rent, which helps her out but sucks for you", "Nta. You have to grow up and fly on your own when it's your time. You are 18. If your mom gets mad at you for it, its probably a good thing that you run, baby, run! It's not worth the toxicity and walking on eggshells. It doesn't get any better the older you get.  I'm being as nice as possible here and not say anything bad about your mom.", "NTA but SOL I think. That is insane for what you make but I think this is her way of telling you to gtfo or get a better job.", "NTA - you're 18 so you're going to need to figure out how to live on your own eventually.    You're mother needs to come up with a means (besides you) of support.      You cannot live with her forever unless you're adept a living with her longer term but that doesn't open the door to a life of your own and a relationship, home and family of your own.   I would encourage you to find a wy to talk to her, perhaps renegotiating rent and encouraging her to seek other means of support if she doesn't currently work.", "This is a tough one. I don't think you are TH. However, it is your mom's house and if she wants you paying rent unfortunately you have to do it or leave. \n\nIf you need to move because of your financial situation and let's be honest your overall mental health. You should do it. \n\nAlso - you need a different job.", "Info: Is she intentionally taking advantage of you or is there a legitimate reason that she is not employed?", "NTA. One of the most valuable decisions you can make at this age is to decide to make your own life decisions that are best for you rather than worry about if someone else will approve of that decision. \n\nYou are an adult now and your life belongs to you. Either your mother loves you as you live your best life the best way you see fit, or she doesn't. Don't fret over this, don't feel guilty. Your life belongs to you. Repeat this to yourself like a mantra. It will sink in eventually and you will be 100% happier for it. \n\nYou can't make your mom love or respect you. But you can choose to love and respect yourself. Good luck!", "NTA but Tha being said. Your an adult, rent is something you gotta figure out. I remember being so mad when my mom charged me rent at 18, I was paying my way through college and working. However looking back I understand why she did and I'm thankful. I'm one of the few people I know from my friend group at That age That actually has most of my shit together. At the time I was jealous of friends that had a free ride. Now I'm 40 with a husband four kids and a good job. I know people from back then that got a free ride and have been on their own and back at home like a revolving door because they never learned how to survive the tough times.

You could pay 800/month for a crappy studio apartment tbh.  It\u2019s too much.  So see if she\u2019s willing to come down on the rent\u2014drastically.  This might solve the problem.  And at least you\u2019ll know you tried to work it out like an adult first.  \n\nI think if you simply stop paying altogether and continue to live there, that would be unreasonable.  So, if you find she is inflexible on the issue, you need to move.  And not to a place where you live \u201crent free,\u201d because nothing in life is truly free.

Parents are supposed to support you and help you to become independent and well functioning adults.  \n\nI'm letting my kid live with me, rent-free, even though last year my kid was making more money than me.
