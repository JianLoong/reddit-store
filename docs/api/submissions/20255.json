She may have felt that way but she never explicitly voiced it. The only thing she said she had a conversation with her sister about is to let OP know if he was going to be there when the sister wasn't.  That's why I think they need to come up with house rules.

You should never expect to be able to act like you live alone (walking around naked, etc) unless you actually live alone. \n\nYou and sister definitely should have clarified rules about guests before you moved in together, because if you expect different rules than she does, you now need to negotiate. \n\nI don\u2019t live with my fianc\u00e9 yet, but I\u2019m always at his house when he has to run out or go do things. His housemates don\u2019t care because it\u2019s a shared place and I\u2019m not a rando.", "ESH - whatever happened to talking to people?", "You and your sister need to get on the same page.", "Replace b with g and the point is still the same", "I would disagree with you. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s up to the boyfriend to assume that he is not welcome there. Different people have different rules. My boyfriend has actually slept over at my house when I was not there and my roommates are completely fine with it. I think that it\u2019s the responsibility of OPs sister to communicate the rules/boundaries to her boyfriend."]}
