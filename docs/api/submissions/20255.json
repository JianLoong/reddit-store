Even if you didn't share the house though, I think you've got the right to know who's there while you're in the house.

WTF\n\nYour sister is an AH for leaving her guest unattended at their house and leaving, even after you told her you have a problem with that \n\nThe bf... well, probably no one ever told him you had such a problem with him being there with you \"alone\", and even in this case he didnt make a big deal out of your attitude, cant really call him an AH.\n\nIf you have a problem with your roommates guests, talk to your roommate, not the guests. Regardless of the family situation.\n\nTalk it out like adults.", "NTA - seems like you and your sister need to have a discussion about privacy and guests just so you both can express how you want this living situation to go. I\u2019m sorry, but I would be extremely uncomfortable if I woke up in my house and my sister\u2019s boyfriend was there and she was not. While you could\u2019ve been nicer about it, it is what it is. Try to practice have a more tact though OP, you don\u2019t know how long this boyfriend may be around and you don\u2019t want anymore awkward situations\n.", "INFO: does your sister own the house or are you both on the lease, or are you sub-letting? You need to have a chat with your sis about what you each expect re:house guests. Hopefully you can come up with a solution that means you both feel safe and respected but at the end of the day, if it\u2019s her house, she would get the deciding vote on who can come and go when and you\u2019ll have to decide whether you can live with that.", "INFO: are you paying rent at this house or is your sister just letting you live there?", "\\>why they are still at my house>i(21f) recently moved in w my older sister\n\nInfo: So whose house is it? Yours or your older sisters?\n\nWere there ever ground rules set on who can have guests over and when?", "For me NTA\u2026 Your tone could have been a little nicer but you need to talk to your sister about privacy in your own place.", "I have a few follow up questions before I can make a decision. \nYou say you moved in with her. Was this her place that she allowed you to move into with her, or was this you and your sister moving into a place together? \nDid your sister's boyfriend move his things in too? Was there a previous conversation about how he doesn't live there? \nThis is definitely something that you need to sit down with your sister to gain clarity and establish boundaries for all of you.", "This happened to me once when I lived with a roommate and her bf was over all the time. He was so quite and would just lowkey lurk and it scared tf out of me. She even gave him a key so he was over all the time. He lived literally down the street, a five min walk. Anyways this is to say that when you\u2019re sharing a place, you need to be mindful of what other ppl are comfortable with. Maybe you could have communicated it to the bf better, but if you\u2019re spooked or just not ok with him always being over esp when he\u2019s not there, that\u2019s your right to feel that way bc you live and pay rent there too.", "True weirdness is that you weren't aware of her boyfriend's existence.\nWhy?\nIs there any reason?\n\nIn my opinion, you overstepped cause he was in her room, not even in a common one.\nHe's undoubtedly aware of...

You just need to decide how far along that track you want to be before you move out. \n\nSiblings are great but can also be a pain in the ass to live with.

But this is something you should be discussing with your sister  and it really should have happened before you moved in together. \n\nYTA just because you were rude and hadn\u2019t talked about it. Not because you think they shouldn\u2019t be there.", "NTA, but act like the adult you are now and have a civil conversation with your sister about it.", "Well, yes, youre an AH. That\u2019s an abrupt and rude thing to say to someone who (I\u2019ll assume) has done nothing to you. If he was in your sister\u2019s room, why tf do you care?", "It is common for adult persons to have intimate relationships with others, and with those others, to allow them to be in their homes when they, themselves, are not.   \n\n\nYour wanting to walk around in any state your choose does not have precedence over this.     \n\n\nYour sister's BF was not being obtrusive - in fact, he kept private, and was in your sister's room, door closed.   \n\n\nIf you insist that he not be there when your sister is not - then, yes,  YTA.", "ESH - You shouldn't have been rude to him. He was your sister's guest and if she told him he could stay he had permission to be there. The person you should have had a convo with is your sister. I mean imagine you were staying with your friend or BF, minding your own business in the their room and then someone they lived with knocks on the door and rudely asked you why are you still here. You would feel really unwelcomed and probably like that was uncalled for, right? Your sister though needs to realize that she is not the sole person on the lease or paying bills and therefore needs to mindful of her roommate and that you might not want her BF around all the time.\n\nYou guys need to seat down and come up with a few \"house rules\". Maybe that guests can only sleepover so many times a week and must leave at the same time as the person who brought them unless there is a conversation about it or something like that.", "He\u2019s not paying for anything in that shared apartment. He shouldn\u2019t be staying when she\u2019s not there. Especially if it\u2019s constant and for long periods of time because then you\u2019re paying for him to live there.\n\nWhen I visited my boyfriend, and I\u2019d wait for him to come home I tried waiting outside because it was weird to stay in a place I don\u2019t live in when my host isn\u2019t there", "NTA. He\u2019s her guest and if she\u2019s not there he has no reason to be there.", "He is your sister's BF. He is her SO. That surpasses being a simple guest.\n\nHe was in your sister's bedroom.

So you go and be a massive asshole to the boyfriend that you didn't talk to about being there or not. What are you gonna do if she wants bf to move in huh? Cause if I was your sister that's what I would do.", "So to be clear, he has been left there exactly twice without you being told, and you felt the need to be so rude to him? He didn\u2019t do anything to you. If you want to be upset at someone, be upset at the person who agreed to inform you that he would be there. Also, twice is not an excessive amount and you\u2019re just being rude. \n\nYTA", "I'd say NTA\n\nThey aren't your guest. They are your sisters.", "YTA.", "YTA", "If boyfriend is staying over a lot, he is not a guest and should be paying rent. NTA", "Do you pay as much rent as your sister?\n\nYou sound extremely juvenile for a 21 year old, especially in how you handled the situation. At least slightly YTA here\n\nIf you pay equal rent, talk to your sister about how you two want to handle guests and romantic partners staying over. Make a policy.", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t talk like that to your roommates guests, let alone your sisters BF. Also, he was in HER ROOM THAT SHE PAYS FOR. \n\nYou just moved out of your families house and now you need to learn roommate etiquette.", "YTA. It\u2019s rude of you to address him in an exasperated tone when it\u2019s your sisters lack of consideration that put him in that position. He is a guest and any issues you have need to be taken up with your sister. Perhaps you two can come to an agreement on guests being left alone in the house.", "YTA.  You're a guest. You have basic human rights, but omniscience of your sister or her friends is not included.", "YTA. Why would you be so mad about someone still being there when it sounds like he's living there. I say that because you mention he has no car and is always leaving when your sister leaves. Makes it sound like he stays/lives there almost full time.\n\nYou moved in with another person get over it. You have a room that you can do whatever you want in whenever you want", "NTA, your sister is and you guys need to sort out the bf staying over as a now uninvited by you guest.", "ESH You and your sister need to have a discussion. You need to talk about what you are comfortable with. If you are both paying rent and on the lease it's fair to say you want to limit the amount of days he spends the night if he's not paying rent as well. You are not communicating what you want to your sister and she's assuming you're okay with things.", "YTA. It\u2019s not YOUR house. It\u2019s hers and her guest can stay as long or as much as she wants/lets them. \n\nIf you want to walk around however you want then get your own place. Stop being entitled.", "NAH.
