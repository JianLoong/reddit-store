If your Dad is so traditional, why isn\u2019t he paying for the wedding? Rights come with responsibilities.", "Your wedding, your rules. NTA.\n\nWhile having the father walk their daughter down the aisle is traditional, this is not a rule written in stone. There are plenty of people who give this duty to other people because those are the important people in their lives, like your sister, for instance. \n\nSounds like it's time to cut out your dad and anyone else that sides with him, from your life. No one has time for that toxic nonsense.", "NTA\n\nYour father was at minimum 55 when he had you with your mother, unless he was a child when he had your sister. That is incredibly creepy and you are right to call him a groomer.\n\nHe should be grateful you allow him to see you at all.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you chose someone who has supported you, raised you and been a role model for you to walk you down the aisle. Your father has no rights, wedding tradition or not. \n\nThe tradition of the father walking the bride down the aisle is kinda patriarchal crap anyway.", "NTA. You should have the one you want walking you down the aisle. That being your sister, your cousin or your friend doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s who they are to you. How important they are to you.", "NTA He showed you and everyone else at the reception why it was your sister & not him walking you down the aisle.", "Not the asshole. \n\nfrom what youve said, you\u2019re right. You owe this man nothing he should be grateful he was even invited.", "NTA. Your are not at the all an asshole for this. Your dad felt entiled and went out of his way to show it. The fact that he made a stink at the reception just goes to show how he cares more about his own wants than seeing you have a good time at one of the most important events you'll have. He might say things that will make you question your decision but at the end of the day you made the best one for YOU. And a wedding is only about the couple, despite what old people try to say. I wish I had the courage to do what you did at my own wedding years ago.", "Nta. Wish you a happy married life \ud83c\udf7b", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't have invited him to the wedding or reception.", "NTA. You're absolutely right that he should be grateful he was invited.

That's all that matters and certainly not your Dad's opinion.", "NTA. Your wedding your rules.", "NTA. Pretty crystal clearly NTA", "NTA. Time to cut out your father out of your life. The same for any family member that's calling you an ungrateful brat. You have nothing to be grateful to your father about.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
