Ever since late elementary school, she has been vegan. This wouldn't be an issue if she didn't force it upon others during every outing.

To spare my cousins I decided to take the heat and pull the adult card on her. When I showed up I said that she can't come because the place is for adults only after 7:00 pm. When she started trying to argue I held my ground and said the best I can do is drive her back home. In the end, this was what I wound up doing before the rest of us went out to eat.
