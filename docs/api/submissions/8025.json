When I still lived with them we would go out 2-3 times a month with my Aunt and her family. This wouldn't be an issue if it weren't for my cousin Kayla((16F).  Ever since late elementary school, she has been vegan. This wouldn't be an issue if she didn't force it upon others during every outing.  Whenever we all go out she forces everyone to go to vegan-only places. Whenever an attempt to go to non-vegan-only places are made she throws a fit. This fit in turn leads to both my parents and hers caving into her demands.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I moved out just over two years ago I decided that I have had enough of that and her. My answer to dealing with her was to simply cut her out of any plans that involve meals. This however was never tested due to pandemic lockdowns. That was until this past week when I decided to reach out to my other cousins.  Since it has been over two years since we have all gone out I decided to invite them to a group dinner. As part of the invite, I made it clear that Kayla nor our parents were invited. Nobody had any objections and the restaurant we chose was a nice steakhouse.  Everything was solid until when it came time to pick up a cousin who didn't have a car. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile on my way there he called me to say that his mother had forced Kayla on him. This didn't work for two reasons; the first was that none of us wanted to deal with her. The second was that the restaurant bans people under 18 years old after 7:00 pm. To spare my cousins I decided to take the heat and pull the adult card on her. When I showed up I said that she can't come because the place is for adults only after 7:00 pm. When she started trying to argue I held my ground and said the best I can do is drive her back home. In the end, this was what I wound up doing before the rest of us went out to eat. While we had a great time the aftermath of this was huge as both my parents and theirs think I am a huge asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole?", "created_utc": 1674421782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10iuby1/aita_for_pulling_out_the_adults_only_card_on/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is facing the consequences of being one of those pushy vegan people that everyone hates. Good job on picking a steakhouse with the under 18 rule.

It\u2019s unfortunate that the rest of the family has taught her that they will revolve around her and her desires/choices. I\u2019m sure she expected that it would happen like that this time as well. But you set a reasonable boundary for yourself and the night, and you upheld it \u2014 there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Don\u2019t be surprised if the family pressures you into caving to her in the future, though. She\u2019s going to raise all hell every time you set a boundary - stay strong.", "NTA.  Even if the restaurant wasn't adults only, the people pawning their annoying vegan minor child on the event are TA.  Were they expecting you to pay for her as well?  The audacity.", "NTA - excise AHs from your life as you wish.", "NTA - I can understand being flexible around someone else's dietary restrictions to a certain degree, however she is vegan out of personal choice, and kudos to her for doing something that she believes in.\n\nHowever, at the end of the day it is a choice she is making and she should understand that the world and other people's plans do not bend to her will. If she wants to have any kind of friends who are not vegan, she needs to find food at places where majority of people tend to eat at. If those places do not exist, then she can find some other place to eat or just not go with that group of people.\n\nShe is none of y'alls child, and none of your responsibility. If your parents and her parents are upset, tell them to take their own child out to vegan places themselves.\n\nWhy should a group of adults change their plans on someone else's? She got voted out, she and her family need to deal with it.", "NTA.  OP....tell your parents and Kayla's that they are enabling her bad behavior, and if she keeps acting like a selfish brat she will continue to be excluded.", "Definitely NTA. I don't know why parents force younger siblings on their older ones. Especially if they are not liked. When I was younger my parents would sometimes force my older bro to take me with him. I would tell them I don't need to be attached at the hip to him but they wouldn't care. So we would go out and I would go over to a friends house. On his way back home he would pick me up.", "NTA.

I have friends and family who are Vegetarian, pescatarian, vegan, kosher, halal, gluten free, low carb, keto etc. \n\nI have never had an issue going out to dinner with any of them, even as a group. Never, not once, has someone demanded that everyone eat the same as them. There are plenty of restaurants, PARTICULARLY in the Kosher and Halal cuisine, that can accommodate a wide variety of dietary needs. \n\nYour cousin is finding out what happens when you become one of those insufferable militant vegans that everyone hates.", "If she's made it clear she has no intention of stopping her vegan proselytizing and you've made it clear you're not going to put up with it, then NTA.

Teaching her that every person will always cater to her isn't helpful to her. Y T A for not being straightforward with her about your resolution though. You need to tell her that you're happy to spend time with her and have meals with her but that you and the rest of your cousins will not change plans on her account. She needs to figure out what she's going to do in these situations and how she's going to handle them as an adult where she can't just throw a temper tantrum and get her way.", "NTA Smart we\u2019re doing the 18 only thing I don\u2019t know why they try to force her on you if you don\u2019t want her around it is what it is and I will tell your parents that they need to stop forcing on you and you\u2019re allowed to go out with your cousins and not everyone has to be invited and maybe if she actually didn\u2019t try to force her dietary restrictions on everyone else it would be different but it\u2019s not so until she learns that there\u2019s no reason for her to come out with you guys", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My husband is not vegan, but is a picky eater. We've gone to many restaurants with friends and he'll look at the menu in advance.

It does not mean going someplace where there's nothing ELSE on the menu besides stuff they're comfortable eating.", "Find another excuse.", "Exactly! And besides, OPs niece wasn't going to be allowed into the place either because of the age rule. Being vegan was a moot point at the end of the day for their plans. I'd just make plans for places that require age limits.", "Yeah and it sounds like they've been caving in and going to just purely vegan based eateries. OPs an adult and can choose to go to a place that has no vegan options.\n\nIf I had a vegan family member and I wanted to eat at a steakhouse, they would not even be on my mind for people to invite, and why should they?", "Yup. If she's been invited to a given outing, they should choose a place where she can find a vegan option she likes. But even then, they have no obligation to choose a place which is purely vegan; they only have to choose someplace where she can eat reasonably. She can either accept watching the rest of them eat meat, or she can decline the invitation, but those are her only two polite options. And she doesn't need to be invited to everything, so when the others want to go to a steakhouse, it's completely reasonable to do that and not invite the vegan. She can be invited on some other occasion when the venue is better suited to her needs."]}
