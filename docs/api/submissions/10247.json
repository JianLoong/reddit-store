Like you said, you could\u2019ve kept the pup around for a bit to see if owner turned up pretty quickly, but taking him to a shelter doesn\u2019t make you an asshole. The dog is safe and not roaming where a number of things could\u2019ve happened.", "NTA.\n\nIf only mankind invented a way to identify a dog and know exactly where their home was. People could place it on their dog so if the dog goes missing, someone who finds him/her knows where their home is. \n\nSigh... too bad that kind of advanced technology just doesn't exist in this day and age. Maybe future generations can figure it out.", "NTA I mean you could have hung out with the dog at home first for a bit but you\u2019re not at all obligated to. You even offered her a ride which is pretty cool.", "NTA and her priorities are severely screwed up. A person who truly loved their dog would have just been happy they were found, not whatever inconvenience going to the shelter resulted in. I think most dog owners would agree here.", "No you're not the a****** .... She sounds a little self-centered and narcissistic to me . ... You did the right thing. Don't feel bad about it.", "NTA. She probably had to pay a fee to the sanctuary but that's her issue for losing the dog and part of the risk of having pets (happened to me once). At least you made sure her pet was safe.", "I vote NTA because what you did wasn't an asshole thing to do. You helped. An asshole would ignore it and leave the dog roaming around to whatever fate. Yes, the lady is responsible for her dog and yes, it shouldn't have gotten out. She was unpleasant about it and could have been more gracious that you did anything at all and at least her dog is safe in a shelter.\n\nBut, and this is just because I personally would have done so, you could have done more before you actually dropped it off at the shelter. Getting a pet back from a shelter can sometimes get complicated and a shelter environment isn't always the best. I would have taken the dog inside and spent a few hours facebooking/calling around/knocking on doors. Maybe even a day or two. But that's just me. Still NTA though.\n\nEdit: spelling.", "NTA, she doesn't sound like a responsible owner at all, poor pup.\n\n1. You took her dog to safety taking time out of your day to do the right thing.\n2. No collar or tags, probably no microchip if the shelter didn't immediately call her\n3. She got angry with you for the inconvenience instead of being grateful the dog had been found\n\nOur dog got out once when the gate was left open and a lady picked him up within  minutes and took him to a shelter. Within 15 minutes I found the lady and where she'd taken him. I was over the moon that she'd done that and so relieved he hadn't been hit by a car or still lost. Can't understand why your lady would be pissed off.", "NTA - she is likely mad at her self and all the extra work she had to do when $5 would have bought a tag and another $10 for a collar. Thanks for helping.\n\nMy 2 cents, maybe wait a little longer next time.  People don't always know right away a pet has gotten out.\n\nEDIT to Add \n\nI have a neighbor who has large parties that generate a lot of traffic & noise.  I could care less, they found my dog once and called the # on his tag.", "NTA", "NTA - you took time out of your day to care for her lost animal. You were incredibly considerate - I wonder how many folks drove by without stopping.\n\nI'm sure she expected you to babysit the dog until you could deliver it to her house.\n\nThe reality is may vets won't take in strays because they know they'll end up making the trip you did.", "NTA.  People really don\u2019t do enough to make sure their dogs can be returned home.  They should have collars with tags, and be microchipped.  I\u2019ve waited with friendly dogs because I was able to contact the owner and kept the dog safe until they could retrieve them.", "NTA if she wants someone to contact her she should have put a tag on the pup.", "NTA, she should have it tagged if she expects you to find her. But yes, maybe next time try the FB thing first. If anything it saves you the drive ;-)", "NTA, but now she may have to pay to get it back.", "Definitively NTA.  You take a lost dog to the animal shelter,   that's what you're suppose to do.   They can read the microchip there and get in contact with the owner.   If the dog isn't chipped and had no tags,  the owner is a negligent asshole.  You did the right thing!", "NTA. You did your part. It's possible she's angry with the situation but after she calms down and thinks rationally, she'd recognize she didn't do her due diligence. I hope she gets a tag for the dog and get it microchipped.", "NTA you did the right thing. Some people are just rude, don\u2019t let it get to you.", "I personally would have waited longer to see if anyone responded to the FB post, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for taking it in when you did. I can also understand why she was annoyed to have to drive an hour round trip and probably pay a fee to get her dog back. NAH", "I would of held onto the dog a little while before taking to the shelter because not all shelters are safe.", "You\u2019re not the asshole. That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do.", "NTA. You did what you were supposed to do. I used to work at an animal shelter. Even if the owner hadn't found you (and how did she?) The shelter would make every effort to find her. They'll scan for a chip, call animal control and put them on a hold for a certain length of time, to give the owners time to find them.", "One of my dogs got lost several years ago and even though she had a collar with an ID tag, it had our home phone number instead of our mobile. Since we were visiting my mother in another town at the time, the person who found her wasn\u2019t able to reach us and took our dog to the shelter. Later he saw us going up and down the roads around my mom\u2019s house looking for her and told us where she was. We appreciated that and went to the shelter. They were very nice and didn\u2019t charge us a cent because she\u2019d only been there 15 minutes. We gave them a donation out of gratitude. \n\nLesson learned: we now have my husband\u2019s mobile number on both our dogs\u2019 collars and since one of our current dogs is a bit of an escape artist, we also got him a GPS collar.\n\nETA: She should have thanked you for finding her dog and taking him to a safe place.", "NTA. I've done the same myself. A _good_  pet owner should be thanking you instead of finding excuses to blame you for thier faults", "Nta. Not your dog,  not your problem.  She's just mad they're going to ask her to fix whatever issue led to the dog getting out and get him tagged.  You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA. you did the appropriate thing anyone would do with a lost pet.", "NTA, it was probably her fault the dog got out and who knows who else is at home giving her shit about it. My guess is she knew she was gonna have to go home and needed to blame you for the added hurdle. That isn\u2019t your problem, doesn\u2019t make it your fault, and you didn\u2019t deserve to be treated that way.", "You are not an a-hole and the lady is ungrateful that you took the time to take her dog to a safe place.  What you did is acceptable and I'm not sure why she thinks she's entitled to anything else.", "Nta. She can be mad all she wants. It's not like you killed the dog.", "NTA.  \n\nLosing an animal is really stressful, so I'm cutting her a little slack.  But only a little.  You were the good guy in this story.", "This is a tough call for me but I guess\n\nESH.\n\nYou say you waited about 10 minutes before taking the dog to the shelter.  That\u2019s pretty quick.  It was nice of you to care for the dog, but if it\u2019d only been a few minutes, the owners might have found it.\n\nThe lady was really rude to you; but I can relate To how she\u2019d feel.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The very first thing I did when S the Sweet went missing thanks to the chaos that followed Hurricane Harvey, was alert the shelters and local rescue groups and emailed them pictures. I would have been thrilled if she\u2019d been turned in.  She\u2019d managed to lose her collar and we don\u2019t know if she ever fell into human hands.  After 9 days of constant worry, we drove up to our house and she was just there.  When she came back we took care of her and then I immediately contacted everyone that she was back.  That person doesn\u2019t know how lucky she was.", "Came here to say this and add on that taking the dog to a vet to see if it was chipped would\u2019ve been a better first move. Situations like this are exactly why chips are suggested, we don\u2019t know if the dog got out because it slipped out of its collar. I\u2019ve taken care of lost dogs before and driving 30 minutes to a shelter is not something I\u2019d do unless I had no choice.\n\nHonestly my vote is NAH, because I\u2019d be pretty annoyed if I were her too! She was stressed about finding her dog just to find out that someone only waited 10 minutes for her to catch up before packing her dog up in a car. Plus the fact that OP\u2019s wife\u2019s Facebook post supposedly said that the dog was going to the shelter, but the owner was waiting for OP to come back sounds like there was a miscommunication along the line there.", "Right. My county shelter charges $100 to get your dog out of the shelter. The amount increases if they're a repeat visitor.  \n\nSo it's pretty standard where I live to wait awhile before taking them, presuming they weren't in a busy roadway. I understand her being annoyed, especially if it hadn't been very long since the post. \nThen again, if you're not sure what to do and don't have a safe space for the animal then taking them to the shelter isn't a bad idea. NAH", "Also I've read (and don't quote me on this because I can't in any way verify it) that some shelters (at least in the states) are incredibly difficult to get your dog back from. Like forcing you to provide proof of ownership to varying degree. Which is fine, I agree with that. It's just that I read a post a while back from a girl that had recently taken over a dog from an elderly friend that couldn't get the dog back from the shelter after it had run away soon after she adopted it. Because she couldn't provide the right paperwork and hadn't owned the dog long enough to have photos together etc.\n\nWorst case scenario the dog gets put down because nobody can claim it in time, if it goes to a kill shelter. Without knowing the dog's history and the policy of said shelter I would have hesitated before bringing it there.\n\nBut again, don't quote me on it. Here in Sweden there really isn't much of a shelter system I can compare to so I'm basing all of this on internet knowledge from rescues and the like that I follow.", "The shelters in my area are more expensive and more difficult to get a lost pet out of, in my experience it\u2019s been much easier to find a neighbor willing to help. It makes me curious what OP would\u2019ve done if the shelter was full.", "I'm curious as to what happens to the animals in your local shelter, if they are repeat visitors and the fee finally rises to where the person can't/won't pay? Do you know?", "I\u2019m from the states and unfortunately this is 100% true, most shelters here don\u2019t have the staff or the funding to take good care of animals in the first place, let alone returning animals to their homes. They don\u2019t quickly process animals either, even checking for a chip could take days. I\u2019ve heard many horror stories like the one you described where people can\u2019t convince the shelter that the animal is theirs and/or can\u2019t afford the fee to get them back.\n\nReally I only think OP isn\u2019t TA because they didn\u2019t act with malicious intent, I would never suggest taking the dog to the shelter so quickly though", "They'll warn you that it'll be more next time, so some people just never go get their pet if they're brought in again. After so long, they're adopted out. They also put them up on the website so you could see your dog is there and presumably you'd know you wouldn't be able to get them out if you can't/don't want to pay.  \n\nI'm pretty sure they've recently started making you chip your dog if they're brought in, too. So I don't know that you could get around it by sending someone else and lying about the dog's identity.  \n\nI've never personally had an animal brought in, but it's a semi-frequent issue on the community pages. People get pissed, in part because there's some more rural communities that let dogs wander.   \nMost people know you **don't** bring someone else's dog to the shelter until you've posted on the community pages and waited awhile, only exception is if they're hurt or in real danger.   \n\nBut there's not really many stray/homeless animals here. Our shelter is frequently importing shelter pets from other states because they've got room. If an animal is healthy and friendly there's very little chance it'd be put down because an owner didn't come get it. Just would be up for adoption", "There are so many stories like it. I want to believe that all of the shelters and the people involved with them are doing the best they can with what they have to work with. And that they all mean well. I want to hope that everyone will get a happy ending and live happily ever after. Unfortunately, that's just not how it goes for so many of the animals that end up there. I understand the fees and bureaucracy involved and why they might be necessary, but it isn't a perfect system.\n\nI agree with what you write about OP. Lacking any other option or not knowing what else to do, taking the dog to the shelter is better than doing nothing. It seems like he did what he could with no ill intent. It's only because I am interested in such things and have thought about it to great extent that I feel I would do different.\n\nEdit: Also, I already have pets, so my home and my lifestyle already caters to animals. If I had to take in a dog or a cat for a bit until I find the owner, I would have the means to do so. I get the feeling that OP wasn't set up for such things.", "Thanks for that! This was one of the better shelter versions I've read about for quite some time, if not the best. It's easy to get hung up on all the places one reads about that are overcrowded or who put animals down left and right. I am glad to know about a more rural approach as well. I love the idea of a place where dogs can be free to roam and still be taken care of at the end of the day.\n\nI guess we get to see way more content from packed city shelters than we do from more rural communities, and it skews ones perspective of what going to a shelter has to mean.", ">Most people know you don't bring someone else's dog to the shelter until you've posted on the community pages and waited awhile, only exception is if they're hurt or in real danger.\n\n**Or if you are not able to keep their dog in your home for some reason.**\n\nAssuming that I didn't have anywhere I needed to be, the most I could manage would be calling animal control to come pick up the dog. Because I would not be able to take the dog into my house or car.\n\nIt's unfair and unrealistic to expect people who are not able to care for a dog -- for any reason -- to do so, just because they happened to be the one who found it. Would you prefer that they just let the dog continue to wander, instead of taking it into the shelter?", ">Would you prefer that they just let the dog continue to wander, instead of taking it into the shelter?\n\nHonestly, that seems to be the prevailing wisdom. If they aren't injured, ill, in traffic, appear to have been running wild for awhile, or appear to be otherwise is distress, and you haven't seen a missing dog post, then people around here *do* say you should leave them alone.   \nTake a picture and post it on Facebook community groups with the specific location.   \n\nIf the dog *is* missing, whoever's looking now knows the area. And almost always if you say you can't do anything with the dog, someone else will volunteer to come help.    \nBut this isn't that large of a community, we don't have any real stray dog population, and the most likely scenario is that the dog belongs to someone 3 streets over. Imagine a cross between rural and suburban.   \nThis is a common drama post topic because people get *reaaaal* angry about others \"not knowing the culture\" and taking dogs from their own neighborhoods.", "NTA her fault and you did a nice thing that could have saved the dog from harm. She should be mad at herself.", "NTA", "My dog doesn't wear a collar at home it's a safety thing.  If the OP had found my dog and taken it to the shelter I would have been so thankful.  If my dog escaped from my property then he'd likely be able to escape from a random property that wasn't dog proofed.   \n\n\nThe no collars at home is a hang over from when I had two and they would play 'bitey face collar grab' games.  There is a risk of one getting caught in the others collar and both getting hurt.  So no collars at home is how we roll.  He's got a microchip that not only as my and my partners info, but also the info of his breeder as an alternate contact so if we can't be contacted, someone who would take care of him is listed.", "There are a million things that could have happened instead.  Dog could have been hit by a car.   Dog could have been stolen.   Dog could have been shot.  Eaten by a wild animal.\n\nI'm sure a lot of people whose dogs went missing would have been overjoyed that their dog has been found and handed into a local shelter instead of getting their knickers in a knot about the perceived inconvenience and having the audicity to be pissed instead of grateful to the person who found it.", "In our county, if your dog is brought to an animal shelter, they charge you a $150 fine for your dog being loose and a $100 fine for not wearing identification. If you don't claim your dog, cash in hand, within 3 days, they're allowed to rehome them. So, his drive might have cost her a lot of money, not just inconvenience.\n\nStill N T A, really NAH, because the dog is safe, OP's under no obligation to keep the dog for any amount of time, and the owner knows where to get her dog. But it's understandable for her to be upset if they have similar laws.", "Yep. In our county, if your dog gets brought to the shelter without identification, you get a $150 fine for letting your dog get out, plus a $100 fine for not wearing identification. It's totally plausible that her dog slipped his collar, so that might not even be her fault. And you need the money within 3 days, because then they list your dog as adoptable.\n\nNAH, but it would have been more convenient to the owner of you waited a bit before bringing the dog to the shelter.", "Exactly. My dog has an ID collar and is chipped, but I\u2019d happily pay crazy amount of dollars to make sure she\u2019s healthy and not missing.", "I get what you\u2019re saying, but it\u2019s definitely NTA. I mean it\u2019s the owner\u2019s fault for not having an ID collar. In my opinion, OP did literally everything you would reasonably expect. The owner neglected their responsibilities and then got upset with the consequences of their own actions and blamed OP.", "$250 at our shelter for the first offense if your dog isn't wearing identification. And you only have three days to bring the money before they rehome your dog.", "In our area, of you don't pay the fine within 3 days, they adopt out your dog, ironically for a $50 fee. Of course, of others beat you to the shelter, your dog is gone. The fine is $150-250 for the first offense.", "As much as I understand her fear (few shelters are no kill shelters at least where I am), NTA bc without tags, how the hell were you gonna be able to do anything else?", "NTA - she's probably pissed because she hasn't kept up on it's shots and license.", "She should be grateful. You made sure her dog was someplace safe. You were not responsible for her dog.", "NTA at all. I have a doggy myself. Most shelters will put an adoption hold on a lost/found dog for two weeks so the owner will hopefully be able to find the dog. \n\nYou did the right thing by driving around the neighborhood and then taking the dog to the shelter.", "I agree completely! My dog doesn\u2019t wear her collar in the house either (a friends pet had a tragic accident when her collar got stuck and I\u2019m too paranoid to leave one on my dog unattended since) so I have her chipped and if trained to never go out the door without her harness on. I\u2019d be thrilled if she did get out and someone brought her to the shelter sooner cause then they\u2019d scan the chip and contact me without me waiting for a stranger to wander the neighborhood."]}
