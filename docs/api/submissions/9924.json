I wouldn\u2019t want to leave any child with someone who isn\u2019t sure they can handle it, let alone a special needs child. It sounds to me like you don\u2019t even see the child that\u2019s much, if it all, so your brother is being irresponsible in asking in the first place.", "NTA. They suck extra for insisting you should do it because they are busy, after you already said no. I wouldn't want to leave my disabled child with someone who has expressed that they might not be able to care for them adequately.", "NTA", "NTA Not your kid not your problem tell your brother to hire a sitter", "NTA \n\nOp, you\u2019re never going to be the AH for not taking a babysitting gig you don\u2019t want and didn\u2019t ask for. You are young, and you\u2019re correct in that this isn\u2019t somehow your obligation or responsibility. \n\nYour brother, and his girlfriend, had a baby. They made the decision to become parents. That means it\u2019s on them to figure out all the things that come along with being a parent - including childcare. Childcare is expensive, and quality childcare is worth that price. \n\nYour brother shouldn\u2019t be expecting discounted childcare services. They should weigh those costs before having a baby, not after. \n\nYou aren\u2019t the AH. Keep studying and good luck with your classes.", "NTA\u2026 The point is you expressed how you felt about the situation you have to study and that\u2019s you\u2019re priority at the moment. The you expressed you weren\u2019t comfortable watching their son who had a disability. And you know what that\u2019s fair enough and a good reason, I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t mean it an a malicious way. In all fairness it\u2019s not your responsibility, it\u2019s your brother and is partners\u2026", "NTA. And of course you can say no because of the kids disability, he has needs you might not be fit to accommodate and that'd just be unfair on the kid.\n\nAlso the \"And since theyve both been working, no ones been able to look after their kid.\" is concerning to say the least - I hope that wasn't literal and the kid was just left alone?", "Aww bro gets no free unqualified daycare, the horror, nta", "NTA. Whats with all the posts here where people irresponsibly make a tiny human, then try to have their family members take care of it for them? It's not a dog or cat, way harder, much more responsibility, especially when the little dude has downs syndrome. You try to live your life the way you want to, they chose a different path, they have no right to shame you when they cannot deal with their own choices in life.", "Having a child with disabilities is the very real possibility that parents often dont consider when starting their family. They chose to have a kid, bow its on then to take care of it, not you.", "NTA, there is nothing wrong with admitting you are not equipped to babysit. They are just trying to guilt trip you into babysitting.", "NTA\n\nTaking care of a \u201enormal\u201c child is hard enough if you dont know what to do. And a down syndrome kid needs special attention and supervision, not a 19 year old student that has to take care of herself.\n\nHe is the AH for calling you a bitch", "NTA for several reasons. \n\n1, as stated by others, you are under no obligation to babysit, *and* you are preoccupied with school. Something that requires your focus. \n\n2, even *if* you ever agreed, if I were you I'd want multiple times of me \"babysitting\" *with one of the parents right there.* Basically a few trial runs, where one of the kid's parents is right there & available in case you run into a problem. \n\nAll that being said tho, I would especially not want to babysit for them if *this* is how they treat you when you're unavailable. IMO you are *not* abelist simply because you are unsure you are equipped to babysit said child. And that's crappy of them to say so. If anything, it shows how much you care for the kid that you don't want to provide supbar care.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to not deal with situations you don't feel you are ready for. As others have said, taking care of a normal 2-year-old is already a huge responsibility that could break even the strongest person. (I should know. My wife and I were asked to babysit our friend's then 2-year-old child. While we love this kid to death, it wiped both of us out) \n\nDealing with a special needs 2-year-old? Yeah, that's a lot to ask of ANYONE. You were absolutely in the right for being completely upfront and honest with your brother about your unwillingness to babysit your nephew. As much as no one likes to talk about it, dealing with a special needs kid is a huge responsibility and an even bigger burden. That may not be \"Politically Correct\" to say, but it's the truth. It's a lot to ask of anyone, especially a 19-year-old college student. Hell, I'm almost 50 years old, and I certainly don't have the skills required to deal with a handicapped child. (I have much respect for those who do, however)\n\nYour brother and his girlfriend are completely out of line for how they handled this. It sounds to me like they were upset at not having anyone to watch their child and lashed out at you. That would be bad enough, but to call you an ableist bitch was completely out of line and uncalled for. \n\nThere were assholes here, but it was them, certainly not you.", "NTA I think here the disability is really to one side. You are not obligated and can\u2019t babysit for your brothers kid for all the reasons you listed under point 1. Whether he has a disability is a moot point.", "NTA - you have your own responsibilities and no training in childcare, or special needs children.  When I was 18, I had a summer job as a daycare teacher.  I was expected to somehow get 26 kids to nap at the same time, including one with Downs Syndrome.  I had no training for kids with special needs, every time I turned around he\u2019d decided to remove his clothes and leave the room and looking back I didn\u2019t know what I was doing.  None of us was ever cruel and we tried to just treat him like everyone else.  All of those kids deserved better.", "NTA. The first point should've been enough. No means no.   \nYour second point is also valid. They stick to the second point because it's easy to guilt trip you  on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They can\u2019t just dump their kid on you because they\u2019re busy.    You have your own life and schedule.   Seems like they\u2019re just being petty.", "First off, you can say no. No is a complete sentence. Second off, you have your own studies to deal with. Third, if they are both working, they should have the money to pay for professional child care. Your brother is trying to bully you into providing free childcare to a child with DS and you don't have any experience with. Just ignore him, OP. Good luck with your studies!!", "NTA and you didn't say no to babysitting him because he's disabled. You said no to babysitting him because he's disabled and you are unsure of your ability to properly care for him. I have a special needs kid and if someone told me that they were uncomfortable watching him because they didn't know if they could care for him as needed. I wouldn't still be trying to leave him with them...wtf", "NTA", "NTA - your brother and his wife can hire a babysitter who is more qualified person to look after a special needs child.", "NTA. The fact that you don\u2019t have time because you\u2019re a student is enough of a reason. No other explanation needed. You are not obligated to babysit their child, and you do not have time.\n\nAnd rest assured, you are not being ableist by declining to watch their special needs child. In fact, I applaud you for knowing your limitations. Taking care of any toddler is a lot of work, but one with special needs is a whole different level. It was very responsible of you to say \u201cI\u2019m not equipped to take care of this child.\u201d Better that than bite off more than you can chew, for you and the kid.", "NTA\n\nYou are not their free babysitter. Disabled or not, you don't have to watch a kid if you don't want to. They decided to have a child, so it's their responsibility to either watch their kid themselves or find childcare. \n\nCan I ask what country you are from?", "NTA you\u2019re busy with college aswell", "NTA. If you didn't make the kid. You're in no way, shape or form responsible for watching the kid. Anyone who says otherwise is trying to guilt you into it because they want a break. If you ever do watch the kid be sure you charge market rate for child care, and I bet they look elsewhere.", "NTA. Regardless of any disability, you aren\u2019t required to provide free childcare services, even if you did have the time. Your time is not less important than your brother\u2019s and SIL. They chose to have a kid, they get the responsibility of taking care of the kid.", "NTA trust me Op the moment you babysit that child they will use you as a free babysitter for years", "NTA.\n\nYou have your own life to take care of. He needs to find someone else.", "YTA, not for not babysitting, but for telling them you aren't babysitting because their child has Down's. They are right, that IS ableist, no matter how you look at it.", "NTA because you aren't obligated.....but, why is everyone so freaked out about the Down Syndrome? The vast majority don't have serious medical issues (which would be a concern, I agree). Down Syndrome children are developmentally delayed....but otherwise  the same as others in my experience.", "NTA. Your first reason is valid even if your nephew didn't have a disability.  Your second reason is valid even without the first reason as any caring parent wouldn't want to leave their child with someone that didn't understand the child's disability and their needs.    Heaven forbid you don't handle something correctly then you are blamed.  Your brother called you an ableist bitch but in reality, he is a selfish parent and selfish brother.   I wouldn't watch a handicapped child if I didn't know how to appropriately care for them.  I am concerned about causing harm and damage.  If I am going to do it, I need to be able to do it right.  Your brother is being totally ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nThe child isn't your responsibility in the slightest and you're right that because you don't have any idea how to care for someone with special needs, it's not that great an idea. Also you didn't say they offered to pay you, so extra NTA.", "People with down's can present with a range of issues from mild to severe. Nowhere does OP mention how her nephew is affected. If he is in the mild range, most likely she could deal with it. She should have just left it at she doesn't care to babysit at all.", "I\u2019m assuming here that babysitting their child \u201cfor a bit\u201d means a medium-to-long term arrangement. If that\u2019s the case, rather than \u201cHey, could you come over Thursday evening from 7-9?\u201d, you are NTA. \n\nThe fact that you\u2019re this baby\u2019s aunt doesn\u2019t put a requirement on you to become his or her child-care provider, regardless of whether the baby has Down\u2019s or something else or nothing at all. \n\nIt seems to me that if you want to play a role in this child\u2019s life, you should learn from the parents what special needs this condition might entail, but that\u2019s not the same as \u201cYou need to give us three afternoons a week for the next 5 months while I get my dream job.\u201d If you wanted a job as a child-minder, you\u2019d be seeking one.", "NTA.\n\nYou too are at the cusp of professional career, the first step of which is college.\n\nYou being only 19 would really not be able to handle a child with down syndrome. The same requires some basic medical expertise.\n\nIt would be best if your brother takes help of a professional nurse or his wife does that.\n\nYou too have a life!!!!", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re not their nanny. \n\nYou have your own studies that you need to prioritise. \n\nThey aren\u2019t actually asking if they don\u2019t accept a \u201cno\u201d. That\u2019s called demanding. \n\nIt\u2019s on them to find someone to look after a child. They should accept it when people say no.", "Im swedish, how come you ask?", "That's ridiculous. A child with Down's deserves to be looked after by someone capable and qualified. OP has recognised they won't be able to provide the correct level of support.", "How is this ableist? OP is simply stating that she neither has the patience, skills, nor desire to deal with a handicapped child. \n\nTaking care of a normal kid is difficult enough. But a child with special needs requires a lot more attention, effort, and patience that OP simply does not care to deal with. She is under zero obligation to acquiesce to her brother's request. If I were her brother, I would rather her be completely honest and upfront as to the reason she doesn't wish to babysit. Some people are just understandably uncomfortable being responsible for a child with special needs. At least now, her brother knows how uncomfortable his sister is about potentially being responsible for his child and will not ask her again in the future. He is, however, completely out of line for his childish reaction. \n\nI hate when people casually throw around words when they're not warranted. She never said her nephew didn't deserve things simply due to his disability, nor that she loved him any less as a result (which is the definition of being an \"ableist\", by the way) she just expressed her discomfort at having to deal with something that has absolutely nothing to do with her. Again, she is under no obligation to cater to her brother or her nephew in any way, shape, or form. \n\nThat doesn't make her ableist in the least. It makes her a person who is simply uncomfortable at the thought of dealing with a situation she is uncomfortable with.", "So you have no problem with an unexperienced 19 yo babysitting a toddler that has a disability that she has never had experience dealing with? You are WAY out of pocket, chief.", "Just wondered why your brother would be so entitled to just demand you to watch his kid. I'm sure Sweden has a lot of daycares that specialize in childcare for disabled kids.", "You seem to be under the impression that all people with Down's are severely disabled and they ALL have high support needs. This is not true, and an ableist assumption. THAT is why they called OP the AH.", "God you people are annoying damn just take the fucking opinion and go"]}
