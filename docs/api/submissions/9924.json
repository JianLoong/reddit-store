You are young, and you\u2019re correct in that this isn\u2019t somehow your obligation or responsibility. \n\nYour brother, and his girlfriend, had a baby. They made the decision to become parents. That means it\u2019s on them to figure out all the things that come along with being a parent - including childcare. Childcare is expensive, and quality childcare is worth that price. \n\nYour brother shouldn\u2019t be expecting discounted childcare services. They should weigh those costs before having a baby, not after. \n\nYou aren\u2019t the AH. Keep studying and good luck with your classes.", "NTA\u2026 The point is you expressed how you felt about the situation you have to study and that\u2019s you\u2019re priority at the moment.

And you know what that\u2019s fair enough and a good reason, I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t mean it an a malicious way.

Whats with all the posts here where people irresponsibly make a tiny human, then try to have their family members take care of it for them? It's not a dog or cat, way harder, much more responsibility, especially when the little dude has downs syndrome. You try to live your life the way you want to, they chose a different path, they have no right to shame you when they cannot deal with their own choices in life.", "Having a child with disabilities is the very real possibility that parents often dont consider when starting their family.

They are just trying to guilt trip you into babysitting.", "NTA\n\nTaking care of a \u201enormal\u201c child is hard enough if you dont know what to do. And a down syndrome kid needs special attention and supervision, not a 19 year old student that has to take care of herself.\n\nHe is the AH for calling you a bitch", "NTA for several reasons. \n\n1, as stated by others, you are under no obligation to babysit, *and* you are preoccupied with school. Something that requires your focus. \n\n2, even *if* you ever agreed, if I were you I'd want multiple times of me \"babysitting\" *with one of the parents right there.* Basically a few trial runs, where one of the kid's parents is right there & available in case you run into a problem. \n\nAll that being said tho, I would especially not want to babysit for them if *this* is how they treat you when you're unavailable. IMO you are *not* abelist simply because you are unsure you are equipped to babysit said child. And that's crappy of them to say so. If anything, it shows how much you care for the kid that you don't want to provide supbar care.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to not deal with situations you don't feel you are ready for. As others have said, taking care of a normal 2-year-old is already a huge responsibility that could break even the strongest person. (I should know. My wife and I were asked to babysit our friend's then 2-year-old child. While we love this kid to death, it wiped both of us out) \n\nDealing with a special needs 2-year-old? Yeah, that's a lot to ask of ANYONE. You were absolutely in the right for being completely upfront and honest with your brother about your unwillingness to babysit your nephew. As much as no one likes to talk about it, dealing with a special needs kid is a huge responsibility and an even bigger burden. That may not be \"Politically Correct\" to say, but it's the truth. It's a lot to ask of anyone, especially a 19-year-old college student. Hell, I'm almost 50 years old, and I certainly don't have the skills required to deal with a handicapped child. (I have much respect for those who do, however)\n\nYour brother and his girlfriend are completely out of line for how they handled this. It sounds to me like they were upset at not having anyone to watch their child and lashed out at you. That would be bad enough, but to call you an ableist bitch was completely out of line and uncalled for. \n\nThere were assholes here, but it was them, certainly not you.", "NTA I think here the disability is really to one side. You are not obligated and can\u2019t babysit for your brothers kid for all the reasons you listed under point 1. Whether he has a disability is a moot point.", "NTA - you have your own responsibilities and no training in childcare, or special needs children.  When I was 18, I had a summer job as a daycare teacher.  I was expected to somehow get 26 kids to nap at the same time, including one with Downs Syndrome.  I had no training for kids with special needs, every time I turned around he\u2019d decided to remove his clothes and leave the room and looking back I didn\u2019t know what I was doing.  None of us was ever cruel and we tried to just treat him like everyone else.  All of those kids deserved better.", "NTA. The first point should've been enough.

In fact, I applaud you for knowing your limitations. Taking care of any toddler is a lot of work, but one with special needs is a whole different level.

The vast majority don't have serious medical issues (which would be a concern, I agree). Down Syndrome children are developmentally delayed....but otherwise  the same as others in my experience.", "NTA. Your first reason is valid even if your nephew didn't have a disability.  Your second reason is valid even without the first reason as any caring parent wouldn't want to leave their child with someone that didn't understand the child's disability and their needs.    Heaven forbid you don't handle something correctly then you are blamed.  Your brother called you an ableist bitch but in reality, he is a selfish parent and selfish brother.   I wouldn't watch a handicapped child if I didn't know how to appropriately care for them.  I am concerned about causing harm and damage.  If I am going to do it, I need to be able to do it right.

She should have just left it at she doesn't care to babysit at all.", "I\u2019m assuming here that babysitting their child \u201cfor a bit\u201d means a medium-to-long term arrangement.

OP is simply stating that she neither has the patience, skills, nor desire to deal with a handicapped child. \n\nTaking care of a normal kid is difficult enough. But a child with special needs requires a lot more attention, effort, and patience that OP simply does not care to deal with. She is under zero obligation to acquiesce to her brother's request. If I were her brother, I would rather her be completely honest and upfront as to the reason she doesn't wish to babysit. Some people are just understandably uncomfortable being responsible for a child with special needs. At least now, her brother knows how uncomfortable his sister is about potentially being responsible for his child and will not ask her again in the future. He is, however, completely out of line for his childish reaction. \n\nI hate when people casually throw around words when they're not warranted. She never said her nephew didn't deserve things simply due to his disability, nor that she loved him any less as a result (which is the definition of being an \"ableist\", by the way) she just expressed her discomfort at having to deal with something that has absolutely nothing to do with her. Again, she is under no obligation to cater to her brother or her nephew in any way, shape, or form. \n\nThat doesn't make her ableist in the least. It makes her a person who is simply uncomfortable at the thought of dealing with a situation she is uncomfortable with.", "So you have no problem with an unexperienced 19 yo babysitting a toddler that has a disability that she has never had experience dealing with?

I also have a nephew with down syndrome, and while he can be a handful at times he is an absolutely wonderful person. It can be stressful to watch him, but it's worth it to me.  Of course, this does not mean you should be offering to take responsibility for your nephew if you don't feel up to it - you need to be realistic with your own capabilities - but don't treat someone with down syndrome like they have the plague, get to know them, you'll probably find it worth your while.", "NTA\n\n>they called me an ableist bitch\n\nThis alone and I'd be saying nope regardless in future.
