My partner went to say goodbye to his mother when all of a sudden she started crying and saying that he was leaving her and she wasn\u2019t his \u201cNO.1\u201d anymore. I stood there awkwardly not knowing what to do. It really upset my partner and we ended up not going out with our friends and went straight home. When we got home I found out that my future MIL said to my son siblings that were to young to be getting married (we\u2019ll be 25 when we officially tie the knot). \n\nWhen confronted the next day she said it was a joke and my family took it the wrong way. We tried to move on and went to view a venue. We fell in love with the venue and set a date. We want a small intimate wedding with close friends and family (60). When my partners mother found out about this she gave my partner the silent treatment for a few days. \n\nWe both couldn\u2019t understand why and I told him maybe he should have a sit down with her and find out if something upset her. So my partner said just that and was told that she\u2019s very annoyed that we went a booked a venue for 60 people because she can\u2019t enjoy her day with her family\u2026my partner was confused as everyone in her family was on the list but she wouldn\u2019t let him explain.

Best of luck and congrats on the engagement", "NTA but pay close attention to how your fiance handles this situation. If he lets her stomp all over decisions that should only be between the two of you and doesn't put her in her place, then you are getting a preview of what you're in for during the entire marriage. Imagine how intrusive she will be if you have children. He needs to set boundaries ASAP. Seek counseling if he needs strategies to help manage.", "She's acting like a child because she's one of those crazies that wants to marry her own son. Nip this bullshit in the bud right now, because it'll only get worse if you don't.", "NTA.  It seems MIL never cut the cord with your fiance - fortunately he isn't putting up with her manipulations and boundary pushing.  I wonder how old she was when she got married - probably younger than the two of you are now.  Have the wedding you want, ignore her completely and go over to /r/justnomil for hints and support on how to deal with MIL going forward - sounds like you'll need it.", "NTA.\n\nYou have not just a MIL problem but a future husband problem.  FMIL is being VERY manipulative and your fiancee is allowing her to do so.  He is enabling her bad behavior.  He needs to set a boundary AND enforce it.\n\nIt's your wedding for how you 2 want it.  If she wants to enjoy some time with her family, perhaps she should plan her own party and stop trying to entitle herself to plan your wedding.", "NTA. This sounds like emotional incest, to be honest. Some mothers have weird attachments to their sons and they get jealous when the son gets into a serious relationship, married, or has a child with someone. This needs to be dealt with ASAP or you\u2019re going to have some major problems with boundaries in your marriage.", "You both are idiots for giving this moron power over you.", "Definitely NTA but your FMIL is trying to manipulate the hell our of you both. She\u2019s that MiL that isn\u2019t ready to cut the umbilical cord with her adult son. She doesn\u2019t want some other woman to be his no. 1. This is enmeshment. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 needs to set and enforce boundaries with her starting now. If not, her manipulation will get worse and she\u2019ll drive a wedge between the two of you. Let your FH read this comments her so he can see what hes dealing with. \n\nCheck out JUSTNOMIL or JUSTNOMIL subs! \n\nCongratulations on your engagement and good luck!!", "NTA for being annoyed, but I\u2019d stop yourself from calling her names (spoiled brat) so early in your relationship. It will get worse if you don\u2019t stop yourself from characterizing her as the evil MIL. She definitely has issues, but you said yourself you or your fianc\u00e9e confronted her. She is struggling with what she feels is losing her son. It is young to marry; 23 & 24 are young. I think it wouldn\u2019t hurt to be generous and kind, ask to join her for lunch, just the two of you. Show her with your openness and friendliness that she is gaining a daughter, and you intend to be a positive part of her family. Ask her her thoughts about the wedding and guests, and try to include her ideas a bit. Showing flexibility will help, if she is just nervous and scared about all the changes. If she\u2019s pathologically attached to her son in a creepy way, it won\u2019t help. But it will help you tell which one is going on. I think you can\u2019t tell which it is yet. Give her the benefit of the doubt for the sake of your future husband and children. She can be made into an ally, if you bend a little. Try to keep all drama away, as it will haunt you for many years if you don\u2019t. You are not just marrying the man, you are marrying his family.", "NTA. That woman sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA. And take this to r/JNMIL.", "NTA. Time to start grey-rocking her about your wedding plans.", "You\u2019ve been together 8 years? And you\u2019ve not gotten involved in his family drama before? NTA but you HAVE to get in there and put your foot down NOW. This woman is going to be doing this to you for the rest of your life if you don\u2019t. Even then she\u2019ll likely still try. Mothers like this can\u2019t be helped, most end up estranged from their kids because they can\u2019t handle anything NOT being about them. I won\u2019t go so far as to call her a narcissist but MIL checks a lot of those boxes. \n\nAt this rate, she will tear your wedding day apart and your family is right. This is YOUR DAY, not your mothers or his. If you don\u2019t get involved, you\u2019ll either end up divorced or no contact with MIL.", "NTA.  Your fianc\u00e9 needs to stand up to his mother and tell her one more complaint about your wedding or comment about your ages, and she won\u2019t be invited to the wedding.  Quit falling for her poor me acts.  If he won\u2019t stand up to her, rethink this marriage because his mom will control your lives.", "NTA - you should be prepared for her to ruin the wedding in some way.  \nShe will definitely make a scene and then blame others for it happening.", "NTA. But for the love of sanity do Not allow this woman to attend your wedding! She Will ruin it.", "Go nc with the old harpy. If you don't, she'll make your life a living hell. \n\nNTA", "NTA. If your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t handle this and put up boundaries with her I\u2019d rethink marrying him. In-laws can make you miserable", "**YTA**  \nYoung? Yes, you are young. But that doesn't matter at all. Your mother-in-law's reaction is so common that you can easily find it anywhere, it's common to the point of being too much. You'll feel embarrassed, attacked, doubtful, confronted, snubbed... and it's the most common thing to happen.  \nYour fianc\u00e9 proposed, and you've already set a date. Great. Now forget about your mother-in-law's reaction and focus on the bridesmaids, the dress, and the honeymoon trip. Check the passports, make sure no one is allergic to anything at the party, prepare the suitcases, send out invitations, buy gifts, and on top of all this, plan post-thank-you notes for the guests. Oh, and there's also posting photos, and it doesn't stop there...  \nDuring this whole period, your mother-in-law will: question whether you'll adopt the surname (in this, she'll invent whether she likes the idea or not), make a scene about prices, suggest someone for the role of bridesmaid or participant, she might ask about your sex life (yes...), already start planning who should take care of the grandchildren in the future, on the wedding day she'll cry, huff, spill wine, or complain about the cake...  \nAnd it's normal and yes YTA because you are complaining about this little tiny human that its only annoyed that her son is getting married. And that's so normal. Get used. You will react the same way in 25 years.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
