Waiting until it was time to pay was an AH move on his part.\n\nYour story comes across as if he planned all along to ask you to pay for everyone. \"Hey, gf, let's ask eksaaaq to come with us. Then we won't have to pay for anything!!!\" It truly sounds premeditated.\n\nIf I were you, I wouldn't go out with him any more without first clarifying if everyone is going to pay their own way or not.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu handled that very well.", "NTA he invited you, he should have been paying for you.", "NTA He's a user not a friend. If you started never paying, something tells me you wouldn't hear from him again", "NTA. I want to think that this embarrassing little episode will get him to change his ways, and save money for outings, but I don\u2019t think he will. I do predict him being without a girlfriend soon, if he keeps up his spongey behavior.", "NTA he's a grown man and needs to learn to control his money it's not your problem. he should be embarrassed.", "NTA and he's not a friend, he's a user.  Once he can't use you for free stuff he won't be around.", "NTA.  Are you sure he is your friend? This isn\u2019t how a friend treats a friend", "NTA. Wow he's up his mooching to paying for his girlfriend to. Why do you even bother with him?", "NTA, given that he threw in 'I thought you were a friend', I think you should look at the fact that his definition of friend is someone who is available for him to use.\n\nStop referring to him as your friend, cuz he doesn't like you enough to treat you right. Stop hanging out with him", "So he invited you out with the intention of getting you to pay. Go with the good ol \"Whoever invites pays the bill\".", "NTA.  People can only take advantage of you as long as you let them.", "You\u2019re NTA. You should have said oh man, you invited me out, I thought you were going to *finally* pay for my food after *all* the times I had to pay for you. \n\nThere\u2019s always next time, because people like him won\u2019t learn and will ask you to cover him again.  Don\u2019t do it, or have him pay you back- Give an estimate, then add 15% moocher fee.", "NTA hopefully the girlfriend doesn\u2019t take as long to figure out he\u2019s a deadbeat", "He's a bludger... So stop paying for him and he might actually learn a life lesson.

Get the leech outta here", "Hey buddy, want to come to dinner with me and the girlfriend as our ~~ATM~~ third wheel?", "Invitee would be the person invited; inviter (invitor?) Would be the person doing the inviting.", "NTA. They only invited you so that you could pay for their meal.", "NTA. I had a friend who would make me pay all the time. I mentioned I didn\u2019t like it more than once and the behaviour still continued. In the end I decided to just stop hanging out.", "NTA  I had a friend like this.  His favorite phrase was \"I got next.\"  Shame on me.  I never should have opened my wallet up to begin with.  All it did was set an expectation that I would always be paying for him.", "Nta he's using you. He treats you like an ATM. Your not an AH for not paying for him and his gf.", "NTA. He only \u201cinvited\u201d you because you\u2019ve paid before.\n\nPlease stop doing this. When your friend has the money to pay, then he can eat out.", "Why are you still going out with him?  As the old saying goes, \"Foll me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.\""]}
