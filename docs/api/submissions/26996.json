Team leader, supervisor or manager hopefully.\n\nGo see a doctor and speak to them about this, in case you have to take stress leave.\n\nPlease follow the company's policy and procedures in dealing with this situation, HR need you to do this. If one day you lose your sh\\*t at this guy, he will play the victim. \n\nMy management were so wishy washy in dealing with my scenario, I ended up going(with my supervisor as witness) and having a quiet chat with creeper about his behavior and how I couldn't put up with it anymore. Best thing I could have done.\n\nI did it so the creeper knew everyone has a right to a safe workspace.", "OPM or baki", "Do you have any form on employee handbook? This is not only a violation of any code of conduct but also of federal law in the US. There is also zero chance that you\u2019re the only female he is harassing. \n\nStaring at this creep does nothing. \n\nDocument and report to your HR department.

When he stares at your chest \"Stop staring at my chest.  That's inappropriate.\". Don't smile.  Don't make excuses.

It won't happen again,\" interrupt and say \"That behavior is unacceptable in the workplace.  I need you to stop.\". Then walk away.  I wouldn't talk to him about anything that isn't work related.

And it will lessen your standing if it escalates to a place where you absolutely have to stand your ground.\n\nI think you\u2019re being TA to yourself for not reporting his behavior to management & asking that he is talked to about this & also not ever scheduled on any shift you are working (and it should be *his* schedule that is affected, not yours!). \n\nConfrontation is hard, no doubt, and it\u2019s extra hard when you\u2019re very young, starting out, and targeted by a much older adult. \n\nThat said, it\u2019s essential you learn how to navigate this kind of situation bc sadly, you\u2019re gonna see a lot more of it in the future bc that\u2019s the crap world women live in. It\u2019s time to learn how to stand up for yourself & handle uncomfortable confrontations; it\u2019s a necessary skillset of adulthood & doubly so for women. If possible, sound out how you\u2019ll approach management with a trusted adult woman in your life (your mom, a counselor, a badass friend, etc) & develop a script you\u2019re comfortable with that\u2019s firm, short, neat & complete in stating the issue. Practice that before going in to report him so you\u2019re comfortable in your skin & know what you want to say. Have it down cold. \n\nAnd then be prepared to leave this job and/or take it to higher management if you do not see action. \n\nIt\u2019s just *not* okay what he\u2019s doing & the sooner you reject the pressure to accept & submit to such behavior, the better. And you\u2019ll gain experience in standing up for yourself. First time is hardest, it gets easier after & eventually you will be a badass yourself. \ud83d\ude09\u2764\ufe0f\n\nNB: If you at *ALL* get a sense that this creep is beyond just ogling & leering lecherously, and is instead coming off as threatening, dangerous or unstable, or if he tries to contact you outside work, or becomes belligerent, it might *not* be the time to flex. If that\u2019s the case, an Irish exit is in order.

Straight up tell him not to fucking touch you. Just like that. A good ol \"Do not fucking touch me again, you do not need to put your hands on me.\" Make sure its in front of other coworkers. Tell him youre sick of him being a creep. He'll be gone within 2 weeks most likely on his own accord. Men like that cant handle being called out.

Sexual harassment is a concern no matter how old the adult is or how much tenure they have in a business, unless there's some really shady practices going on. Please report it. I was abused by two of my previous managers when I was younger. I should've reported them, but I was scared into thinking I'd get in trouble for doing that. \n\nReport it to as many people of higher authority (management, HR, the CEO). Create a paper trail.

Give HR this written documentation along with your verbal request to ask for this to stop. If sexual harassment is repeated and pervasive to cause a hostile working environment, it is illegal (in the US).  Ask them to help stop the behavior, be cooperative with them to maximize the chance you keep your job. They very likely will stop it, either by talking to him or possibly moving him.", "Do not stare at him back he'll see it as flirting or a come on.", "I bet he does it to other people.  Take a big breath, be strong and report him.  You\u2019ll be standing up for yourself and other women.  Your boss sounds weak that he hasn\u2019t been fired yet.
