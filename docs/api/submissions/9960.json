Mainly out of curiosity when I walk into the free weights section, I assume it's bc I'm 4'10\" barely 100 lbs and they're wondering if I even know what I'm doing... But either way, sometimes men even approach me and talk to me, usually about working out, I've made a couple gym friends that way, which helps if I need a spotter.... Even the guys that wanna creepy stare at me...I just ignore... It's whatever I'm there to work out nothing more.  I'm not going to play the victim everytime I see a creeper, I just mind my business and continue my workout... They usually just go away.\n\nWhat you experienced was not ok, and if you see her again, I'd give an employee a heads up about what happened and let them know you're just there to work out, and don't want any issues...

How many times have people made comments like \"damn he's lucky\" when a teen boy is r*ped by a teacher? It's almost like it's expected of men to want sex so much it's impossible to r*ape them.
