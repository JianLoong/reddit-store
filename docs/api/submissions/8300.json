That\u2019s the opinion that matters.  If your sister is around when your mom is complaining again, just ask your sis what she though.  (Of course, then mom will be pissed at both of you.)\n\nThe real issue isn\u2019t your sister\u2019s party, it\u2019s that your mom is worried about the rest of the family reacting you in a skirt.  Sorry.", "WTF and NTA. You dressed up. It\u2019s a birthday. It\u2019s what people do. Is your mom usually concerned with what other people think?

It was your sisters party and she helped you get ready. Your family are the ones with the problem and looking to assign blame.", "NTA- Your sister lent you the skirt FFS, and did your makeup, she was very obviously more than okay with it! It's her party and she clearly wanted her guests to accept you, and for you to feel safe and happy. It was very rude of your mother to wade in like that when your sister was being a decent and supportive human being.", "Thanks lol. My boyfriend at least thought it was cute, and obvi my sister and her friends did too since they helped me.", "I mean, it kind of blows my mind that *anyone* really wants to wear a skirt, but then, I'm a woman who hasn't worn a skirt since her sister got married in 1997 lol\n\n(No, not even to my own mother or father's funerals. )\n\nI mean, it's cool if they want to ...

Especialy cause I couldnt tell how much of it was \"entertaining your sister\" vs \"sis knows and is helping\" from the way you wrote your post", "I was joking about being totally cis lol.

Either way, you are NTA and keep doing you!", "NTA. Dress how you like. Your sister didnt seem to have a problem, and it's HER party. Also, a birthday party is not an attention seeking contest.

My family is used to my brother being in feminine clothes. They'll get used to it too or just learn to shut their trap about it.", "NTA. As an old woman I'm going to say it--it's a whole new world out there, just like the WNW we sprang on our parents. People my age need to get used to it.", "Agreed.
