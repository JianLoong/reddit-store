Before that we used to go hiking almost every weekend and do other sports like skiing/snowboarding together. He\u2019s a lot slower because of his injury and when we hike I have to walk at a much slower pace and often wait for him to catch up with me. It\u2019s also an hour drive to go to the trails, so I\u2019d rather go only if the hike is at least 3+ hours and a workout.\n\nMy dad asked me to go hiking with him this morning again and I said no. He kept pressing me about why I don\u2019t want to, how come I used to love the trails we used to hike in but now don\u2019t seem interested. I was annoyed that he was acting like the problem was with me, like that I\u2019ve fallen out of touch with nature or something. It rubbed me the wrong way. \n\nI decided to be honest with him and tell him the truth. I was blunt and said he\u2019s so slow it\u2019s not fun at all for me to go hiking with him and that it\u2019s a waste of time because most of it is waiting around for him to catch up. I also don\u2019t have much time anymore because I\u2019m studying a lot and barely see my friends so I\u2019d rather spend my time with my friends. This is the part where I may be in AH territory because I conveyed that I still do go hiking and spend time in the outdoors with my stepdad and mom so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m suddenly a nature-hater.\n\nMy dad just got really sad and left the room and then I felt bad but also glad I said it because I wanted to be straightforward about how I felt. My stepmom came into my room this afternoon and said my dad is really hurt by what I said to him and that I shouldn\u2019t have said it because it\u2019s not like he had control over his knee injury. My stepmom said he\u2019s still struggling a lot emotionally with his knee injury as it is most likely permanent and it\u2019s something he\u2019s really sensitive about. She said I should apologize and tell my dad I didn\u2019t mean any of what I said. I said no, I was just being honest and deserve to voice my thoughts.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668305494, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytp40i/aita_for_truthfully_telling_my_dad_why_i_dont/", "score": 628, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sucks to be you, old man.\"", "YTA. Dude, I know you're a teen and therefore don't have a fully developed prefrontal cortex, so I'll be as clear as possible. Hiking for your dad isn't a workout. It's him spending time with his son before that son goes on to live his own life. Kids only grow up once, so he's trying to be a part of your life. \n\nFor context, my dad was a drug addict who told me everyday what a piece of trash I was. I spent my entire childhood trying to show my dad why he should love me, and all I ever did was fail. I would have given anything to have just 1 day where my dad loved me enough to do something nice with me. A hike, slow or fast would've been a dream come true.", "YTA. Do you seriously have no empathy at all? Ill tell you something for free you might not have considered- your dad like hiking because its special time with /you/. And guess what, when you were a smaller kid, you would have been really slow too. He spent years patiently waiting for you to catch up, but he didn\u2019t bitch about it because it wasn\u2019t about the hike. Take a long hard look at yourself and your selfishness. Your dad won\u2019t be around forever, and when he\u2019s gone you\u2019ll hate yourself for not going on every hike you could with him.", "I've already commented and passed an YTA judgement on this but I've had a few minutes to reflect and this is one of the saddest posts I've read in a while. It's like the setup to a melodramatic teen movie but in this case it's real life. I hope you realize how wrong you are before it's too late.", "YTA. And covering up with the excuse of just being honest. \n\nThis is something you two did together and dad probably loved. You could have offered another activity. You could have shown an ounce of empathy. But it was about you.", "Question: Do you love your dad? Do you even care? Because, honestly, it sounds like you don't. I will forgive you somewhat as you are still a kid, but man, you were cruel.\n\nThese hiking trips were more than just hiking trips. These were bonding moments between your father and you. These were moments that you two could share an experience you both love. However, now these moments are gone. Ripped from your father. So not only does he most likely have a permanent injury, his relationship with his son is now alter forever.\n\nYTA", "Oh honey. You think you may be the asshole because you admitted you still hike with your mom and stepdad? No you were already the asshole. Telling him you hate hiking with him because of his injury was an AH thing. YTA.", "YTA. I can't even put into words how much of a selfish asshole you are. I realize you're a teenager and are at the stage where you are oblivious to the things around you, but there will come a day when that conversation with your dad is the worst memory of your childhood. You will regret it until the day you die.\n\nYou should try to make amends as soon as you can and get off of your high horse.", "YTA. You are young and very immature...and self-centered. When you grow up you will understand the severity of your words. Hopefully your kid will have some empathy and tact towards you.", "You're an AH, kid. Using \"I was just being honest\" makes it even worse. You can be honest and not a jerk. You can have some tact. You were a jerk and yeah made your dad feel like crap for wanting to spend some time with you. Many people hike to enjoy nature with the people with them. Not just a workout. And that you go with your stepdad? Jerk to say that too. Your poor dad. He sure got a dud for a son.", "YTA. If you love your dad, go hiking. If you don't, you're going to regret it.", "YTA your dad is not going to be around forever, he probably feels replaced since you go with your stepdad and find your dad too slow for you now. suggest something else to do with him, he wants to spend time with you. saying you\u2019d rather spend time with your friends instead of him was so \u2026 horrible. your father loves you and i\u2019m sure the hiking is an excuse to spend time with you. go on nature walks at the park, take him bird watching or even hunting. don\u2019t like those ideas ? go to a creek with a book about insects and try and find them. take your dad out with little jars and create a closed ecosystem. it doesn\u2019t matter. just spend time with him. you sound so insensitive and use honesty as an excuse.", "YTA. \n\nYou are being extremely selfish.

Then you have the audacity to say it isn\u2019t your fault?!?\n\nIt is your fault. You made the decision to not go hiking with him. He didn\u2019t make the decision to get injured.

This time with you is important to him and you just threw him aside. YTA", "YTA. You have a dad who loves and cares about you and wants to spend time with you. You should thank your lucky stars. Have any clue how many people have absent or abusive parents and would do literally ANYTHING in order to have a parent give them a second thought? You\u2019re spoiled. Tell your dad I\u2019ll hike with him anytime.", "YTA. Ouch. You have a parent who wants to spend quality time with you doing something you enjoy? Except he got injured and goes slower now? Way to tell your dad you don\u2019t care about his company or value the time spent with him because you aren\u2019t burning enough calories doing it. I feel so bad for your dad. Enjoy your youth. Age comes for us all and we never know what kind of health we will find ourselves in. Apologize. I mean if you care at all about your dad, apologize. Find another activity to do closer to home together if you are stressed about studies. But damn, that was cold of you to treat your dad like that. I wish my dad had wanted to spend one on one time with me like that doing an activity I enjoyed for the sake of wanting to be with me. You\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t even know it.", "Yta. Dad wants to spend quality time with you and you push him away?!?!?", "Your dad doesn\u2019t hike bc he loves it. He hikes bc he loves you and that\u2019s how he spends time with you.

When he passes you will regret this.", "YTA\nYou basically told your dad he's not worth spending time with because he's injured. Good to know your love for him is based on what he can do for you.", "YTA - this is actually something you\u2019ll regret as both of you get older. Your dad wants to spend time with you because he loves you and wants to do something both of you enjoy. Hiking probably causes him a lot of physical pain now and he is aware of how much slower he is, but it\u2019s the quality time he gets with you is what counts. You even had to rub it in his face that you like it better with your stepdad and mom now. But like I said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an intentional Ah, you just don\u2019t know better yet and will regret it as time and age drags you both down. Find something else that you both enjoy and can do that can replace those weekend hikes. Or get your workout before you go", "YTA, just reading this post made me hate you, be grateful your dad spends time with you.", "YTA.\nOdds are your dad just want quality time with his kid. The hiking in it self is probably secondary. \nYes of course he is much slower now after an accident, and of course it is not as fun for *you* to hike that speed. But how about try to something fun for both.\n\nYou could have said something to him about hiking might not be the best activity for you two to do together due to sircumstances, but that you of course want to spend time with him, and you can together come up with what is a good activity to do.\nInstead you made him understand that your wellbeeing and your enyojment was more important than you two spending time. Especially since you still hike and hang with other family and extended. Of course that made him feel like sh*t. He reached out, and you brushed him off. To me, that makes YTA.", "YTA. Your poor dad \ud83e\udd7a", "Allow me to be honest and voice my thoughts: you are a HUGE asshole. That was an incredibly horrible and insensitive thing to say to someone who loves you and loves spending time with you. He's injured and dealing with a possible permanent disability and you completely shit on him. It's a terrible thing to have ZERO remorse for hurting someone who cares about you. You need to grow up and have some empathy. It could absolutely happen to you one day. Is that how you'd like to be treated?", "This is one of the saddest posts I have seen on Reddit", "YTA. And a huge one. What a horrible way to treat your dad over something he can't control.", "YTA.  It's not what you said, but how you said it.  You could have used this as an opportunity to re-connect.  Those trails you hike on...do they allow mountain bikes?  Maybe your dad could get one of those new electric-assisted mountain bikes.  If he can still hike slowly, then he should be able to ride a mountain bike...especially if he has an electric motor to assist with the  pedaling.  Then you could chase him around on your own mountain bike, with or without the electric assistance.  You two might find that you enjoy it more than hiking, even.  You can cover crazy long distances that would be impractical for a day hike.", "YTA, I lost my dad last year and I'd kill to be able to spend time with him again but I'll never get that.\n\nYour dad got injured, he's in pain and he still wants to spend time with you and you brush him off and tell him that you'd rather spend time with friends who you probably won't see again after school.\n\nI don't even know why you posted here as you obviously know that you're YTA", "YTA. Your dad just wants to spend time with you and your step dad comment was completely unnecessary unless you were trying to hurt him.", "YTA your dad wants to spend time with you and you basically told him he wasn\u2019t good enough because of an injury unlike your stepdad I doubt tho he\u2019ll ever ask you again", "YTA why are you leaving your dad behind while hiking?

You go hiking with your mom and stepdad for exercise, enjoy time with your dad.", "YTA\n\nYour dad wants to spend time with you and you just basically told him he isn't important to you anymore now that he's got this knee Injury.\n\nMy dad is a recovered alcoholic and I missed out on so much as a child so when I had a chance to do anything with him, I grab it. Thankfully he went into recovery, but it didn't happen until I was an adult.\n\nNow my dad is pushing 80 and has bad knees and a bad heart. When I go visit him and he asks me if I want to go hiking I'm all over that. He's slow, needs to take rests and often we don't get very far before he needs to go home. I treasure every moment I have with him and for us doing something we found we both enjoy doing. I even watch wrestling with him like I did when I was little (one of the few things we did when he was sober). I'm not big on wrestling anymore, but my dad loves it and I love him so I stay up late to watch it with him and we have lively conversations while watching.\n\nThere will come a day when he won't be around anymore and so, when we go hiking, I take every moment I have to stop and wait for him, every time I have to help him over rough patches and every rest we need to take as another moment I get to spend with him.\n\nAnd he gets to spend time with me, which I know is very important to him, especially given the past.\n\nYou're a teen, I get you have friends and other things you like to do and your dad is just too slow and not as fun.  And him asking you like it was something that was going on with you, he wasn't wrong. It was something you were having issues with.\n\nYou don't have to go hiking with your dad anymore, sure, but he loves you and loves spending time with you and still loves to go hiking and makes the effort even with a bum knee.  Trust me when I say one day your father will be gone, and you will have regrets in not spending more time with him.\n\nAnd the way you told him was cruel and mean spirited.

It\u2019s no longer a work out, that\u2019s for friends and your Mom/SD. Hiking with Dad is now about going at a slower pace and just spending time together. What Dad heard is you think spending time with him is a waste of time. I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t mean it that way, but I\u2019d apologize.

Go by yourself to get your workout in, go with your dad for the time. When the day comes that your out of it this will be a moment you think about. Better to learn this young and stop taking time with people for granted. It is incredibly limited.", "Aww, man, YTA. Look, you\u2019re still very young so I\u2019m not going to rag on you. Your dad loves spending time with you. I guarantee, even without knowing your father, that all that time he spent with you hiking, skiing and all that was mostly to just spend time with you because you\u2019re his son and he loves you. You may not see it now but what you said to him made him feel like you don\u2019t enjoy spending time with him. If you enjoy getting a good work out and going fast that\u2019s cool but still take those hikes with your dad. Just prepare yourself to go slower and have a good time with him.

I told him that I was hiking with my dad and my daughter was hiking with her dad. It was all good. I would not now trade that time for anything.

I was annoyed that he was acting like the problem was with me, like that I\u2019ve fallen out of touch with nature or something. It rubbed me the wrong way. \n\nI decided to be honest with him and tell him the truth. I was blunt and said he\u2019s so slow it\u2019s not fun at all for me to go hiking with him and that it\u2019s a waste of time because most of it is waiting around for him to catch up. I also don\u2019t have much time anymore because I\u2019m studying a lot and barely see my friends so I\u2019d rather spend my time with my friends. This is the part where I may be in AH territory because I conveyed that I still do go hiking and spend time in the outdoors with my stepdad and mom so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m suddenly a nature-hater.\n\nMy dad just got really sad and left the room and then I felt bad but also glad I said it because I wanted to be straightforward about how I felt. My stepmom came into my room this afternoon and said my dad is really hurt by what I said to him and that I shouldn\u2019t have said it because it\u2019s not like he had control over his knee injury. My stepmom said he\u2019s still struggling a lot emotionally with his knee injury as it is most likely permanent and it\u2019s something he\u2019s really sensitive about. She said I should apologize and tell my dad I didn\u2019t mean any of what I said. I said no, I was just being honest and deserve to voice my thoughts.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Hiking likely assists with his recovery and it's a good chance to bond and destress from daily life and worries.\n\nPart of being an adult is learning that it's not always about you and your desires. Do you think your dad doesn't know that he's slowed down by his injury? Of course he does. It's likely that he enjoyed the time spent together with you and wasn't just looking at your hikes as a way to get in a workout. It's good to take this lesson to heart now while you're still young and apologize to your dad for being inconsiderate. If you find hiking slowly too frustrating, try to find something else that the two of you can do together that would be enjoyable for the both of you.", "YTA.

No? And then to rub it in his face that you still enjoy going hiking with your stepdad, what exactly did your dad do to make you want to hurt him so much? Like, my dad beat the crap out of my mom for 16 years and then refused to see me after I turned 14, so if I had the chance to really cut him down to size I would, but your problem seems to be that you can't keep your heart rate up because you have to wait for your injured dad to catch up.

If you love your dad and want him to be okay, go on these hiking weekends. Slow down the pace. Take some breaks with him. Ask to go on some easier hikes or ones closer by.
