We agreed to let my brother (29), his 8 months pregnant wife (28) and their 7yo son move in with us temporarily until the home they bought is ready (the tenants are fighting eviction). They've been here 3 weeks and court is in a week. They shouldn't have been here much longer. The stipulation was they had to buy food for the household as payment for us keeping them. Brother and his wife are staying on my couch and their son is staying in our spare bedroom. My brother works full time. His wife is unemployed. \n\nWhen they moved in they purchased almost $1000 worth of food for the house. A $500 meat package and the rest was perishables. Given that there's 6 people living here now, food goes quick. Well, the other day I asked them to not cook any of the meat for themselves during lunch time because we needed the meat for dinners. My brother said \"we bought the food and we aren't going to be told we can't eat it\". My SIL however is very much so nonconfrontational so when it's just her and her kid here, she tends to give him a sandwich or whatever lunch. \n\nWell yesterday I got up around 11:30, near lunch time, and found my brother frying up steaks for his wife and kid. I asked him why he was using the steaks, as we could use those for dinners and he flipped out. He said \"my wife hasn't been eating anything but dinner because you made her feel like a piece of shit for eating food SHE bought. From here on out you will not be micromanaging my pregnant wife's food intake.\" I've never micromanaged her food intake but she should be eating lunch food with her kid and if she doesn't do so, that's her fucking problem. Which I told him. He gave me some lame excuse of \"my wife has never eaten bread and you guys have eaten everything else in the house\". My kid does eat a lot due to her ADHD meds but there's other shit this woman could make herself (soups, Mac n cheese, etc). He told me to butt out and again, she bought the food and she's eating it. So I told them to leave. He took off with his wife, kid and all the food they purchased and some of what I purchased, to \"make up for what I've eaten of theirs\". My mom says I'm an AH because she thinks I'm being ignorant over food. But then eating all the meat during the day leaves little of what I can choose from at night to feed my family and this was the agreement.

She\u2019s 8 months pregnant god dammit let her eat. You\u2019re justifying your kid\u2019s food intake but are so selfish to not extend the same courtesy to your SIL?? You don\u2019t own somebody just because you decide to help them. YTA if it wasn\u2019t clear already.", "YTA- They spent a grand on food. Your brother\u2019s comment about not being told how and when to eat it is spot on. \n\nOP sounds like a bully.", "\u201cMy SIL however is very much so nonconfrontational\u201d YTA just say you\u2019re taking advantage of her discomfort with arguments while she\u2019s already in a vulnerable place (pregnant and temporarily living with you which sounds rough)", "YTA.  Unless you stipulated that \"meat was for dinners\" before they moved in and they agreed, you are changing the arrangement.  Plus, what's the problem with an occasional vegetarian dinner?", "YTA, I\u2019m very confused about the line in the sand you\u2019ve drawn between lunch and dinner food. Sure lunch typically might have a smaller portion than dinner but steak is a perfectly acceptable lunch meal (and breakfast for that matter, steak and eggs always delicious). Your examples of food she could have had are also not lunch specific (imagining the Seinfeld episodes \u201cNO SOUP FOR YOU, that is a lunch food how dare you eat it for dinner\u201d) because, again, that\u2019s not a thing? \n\nAre you cooking dinner for everyone? Your use of \u201cwe\u201d is kind of ambiguous here, but it sounds like you are asking why he is cooking the steaks because YOUR family would be eating them for dinner. That\u2019s pretty shitty. \n\nAlso, she\u2019s 8 months pregnant. She\u2019s gonna have cravings, she\u2019s gonna need more food. She\u2019s also gonna need a little COMPASSION. If the specifics of the food were that important to you (still cannot get over the fact you think steak is only for dinner) you should have clarified that before the arrangement was finalized.

You seem to enjoy lording it over people just because you\u2019ve done them a favour. \n\nI\u2019ve had people stay with us temporarily and I have not asked them for anything. It\u2019s called being generous and hospitable - especially to your own sibling. Try it once in a while.\n\nBTW - if you run out of meat, there\u2019s a supermarket and go and get some more.

You DO seem to have micromanaged what they ate and when. Unnecessarily, I might add.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t particularly nice about it, but he wasn\u2019t wrong and you got angry and got hour knickers in a twist and threw them out- over what? Cooking their food.\n\nAlso, by requiring them to buy food for both parties/groups you set yourself up for conflict, and unnecessarily so: it\u2019s clear that two families will eat a different amount of food at different times, have different preferences etc. For a few weeks it\u2019s simply easier for each to buy their own food. And for these few weeks they could have contributed an additional lump sum to utilities etc (for instance 500$ or \u00a3 or \u20ac or whatever).\n\nYou unnecessarily set up an arrangement prone to failure and conflict, and you threw your brother out because he was being a dick when he was essentially right, out of anger. You sound controlling and like a bully. YTA.", "YTA. They're almost gone so leave it alone. If they end up staying longer than 3 weeks, ask them for cash next time.\n\nWhy can't you cook steaks for your own family at night even if they're eating them during the day? Are there none left?", "YTA. They can eat what they want. You have no right to hoard it. If the food runs out and they\u2019re still there they could buy more. It\u2019s $500 worth of meat in 3 weeks. That\u2019s far more than enough. Wow.", "YTA The food was purchased for the entire household to eat. If they go through the meat, I would imagine they would buy more groceries since that is what they are responsible for while they are staying with you. There would be nothing wrong with you indicating that you planned to use specific things for that night's dinner, for example, but a blanket ban on them eating a whole category of food they paid for is over the top. You also could have actually done meal planning, shared your plans with them, and agreed that they would get certain items for what you planned to make. \n\nYou basically called dibs on all the meat because that's what you like to cook for dinner. You gave zero consideration to their food preferences and decided what you think they \"should\" eat for lunch. Eating processed soup and mac and cheese is not healthy food, and if your SIL wants to eat unprocessed, real food for the nutrition she needs for herself and her baby she should do that. Who the hell do you think you are trying to dictate what she eats for lunch?\n\nHaving them purchase the food as a barter was a disastrous plan from the start. Not everyone likes the same foods or has the same eating habits. This was inevitably going to lead to conflict. It has, and now you've likely damaged your relationship with your brother. It would have been much better if you had agreed to a set amount of money they would pay you and you each purchased your own food (and segregated it) with possibly a combined meal once a week or something. \n\nWe lived with my in-laws for about six months while our house was being built and that's exactly what we did. The only coordination needed was who would use the kitchen when and what the weekly combined family meal would be that Sunday. We are still close decades later because we each minded our business about the others' eating habits. You will not have this experience because you have acted like an entitled control freak.", "YTA, instead of having this weird food dynamic where you feel entitled to whatever from it and they can have what is left over maybe just charge them a couple hundred for utilities and inconvenience.", "Are you proud how you ripped off your brother and his pregnant wife?\n\n1000 $ for 3 weeks on a couch and not allowed to eat?\n\nYTA", "YTA yikes.  Buying food for the house does not equal \u201cbuy food and let me dictate how it is consumed\u201d.  They did their part, they bought food, you don\u2019t get to tell them when and what to eat.  Again I say yikes \ud83d\ude2c", "YTA. You have a strangely strong attachment to dinner meats. It's absolutely fucked but also hilarious. I'm not 100% confident this isn't trolling but who can say.\n\nAlso, if you can kick them out whenever you want (and you certainly can), shouldn't they have control over who eats the food they bought and when? That logic should cut both ways but it's not what you want, so you just ignore it. Good luck to your brother and SIL.", "YTA.\nA grand for 3 weeks? You're using them and you know it.", "What? YTA. You said buy food for the house. That means she should be able to eat anything she wants and shouldn't be made to feel guilty for wanting meat for lunch occasionally. Plus she's pregnant. I don't even understand your argument. Basically, you're saying buy food as payment for being here but I get to tell you what and when you can eat it. Just....no.", "Just judging by your other comments you won't allow any reasoning in your life. But YTA", "YTA. Your grocery agreement was a poor choice. Everyone's desires and needs are so different that food does NOT make a good currency/debt exchange, and sets you up for failure.  Your concept of 'lunch food' is YOURS alone, and made up in your own mind -based on YOUR individual and personal way of doing lunch - it's a VERY subjective concept. In our house we don't do breakfast, but have a large lunch and a light (or no) dinner,  depending on how active our day was.  You failed to recognize that the Food as Currency plan was causing more problems than it was solving, and instead of abandoning it for something more workable, you stubbornly stuck it out and ruined relationships over your lifestyle differences.", "YTA and a horribly selfish woman", "What an asshole.  Who is so controlling as to be upset by a pregnant woman eating meat her family paid for, because \"it's not proper lunch food?\"", "Info: have they said that they aren't buying any more food and that this is all that you have to live on until they move out?", "YTA\n\nIf you run out of meat they can buy more \ud83e\udd14", "Dude I understand pinching pennies and corners because times are tough, but you went wayyy overboard here. The deal was they buy food, not you hoard it for yourself. Not cool. Yta", "YTA. These kind of arrangements are stupid when you\u2019re going to be micromanaging everything like that.
