It's obvious where she got it from given that your brother encouraged her behaviour and didn't think being rude to elders, in their own home much less, is an issue. \n\nAs long as it wasn't dangerous outside, or cold/raining/extreme weather I don't see what the issue is with a kid spending some time outside. If your brother isn't going to parent his kid, someone else will, regardless if it's you or some stranger on the street. \n\nIt's clear there's no fixing this kids behaviour either. At 14 they are too far gone and set in their ways, she will be rude and entitled for the rest of her life unless there is serious change, and unfortunately, that change is not for you to dictate.

You do not pay rent. You are living there because your mother allows you to, just as she allows your brother and niece to, live in HER HOME FOR FREE.\n\nis just as applicable to the 14 y/o as it is to OP.\n\nNot to mention, 14 y/o had her phone and was \u201ckicked out of the house\u201d into the terrifying expanse of the\u2026backyard.

It\u2019s not wildly out of order to expect her to be respectful of the noise she makes, in a home that isn\u2019t her permanent residence. \n\nAlso, it is _NOT_ expected for a 14 y/o to play her TV at an outrageous volume. \n\n> Apparently no one has ever had or been around teenagers before.\n\nNo, I, too, was 14 once.

I have no idea why your brother is ALSO not paying rent, unless your mom makes six figures. YTA and grow the fuck up.\n\nETA: So he's there with his daughter temporarily while they look for a house. Meaning he was in his own home, but had to move out for whatever reason, and your mother let him stay temporarily.
