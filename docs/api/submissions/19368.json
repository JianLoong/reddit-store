It's obvious where she got it from given that your brother encouraged her behaviour and didn't think being rude to elders, in their own home much less, is an issue. \n\nAs long as it wasn't dangerous outside, or cold/raining/extreme weather I don't see what the issue is with a kid spending some time outside. If your brother isn't going to parent his kid, someone else will, regardless if it's you or some stranger on the street. \n\nIt's clear there's no fixing this kids behaviour either. At 14 they are too far gone and set in their ways, she will be rude and entitled for the rest of her life unless there is serious change, and unfortunately, that change is not for you to dictate.

You are a 21-year-old arguing with a 14-year-old. Why you are doing this, I do not know. \n\n\n3. You can't change your niece's behaviors. That is her parents' problem and not yours. What you CAN do is change how you respond to the situation. If she did not respond to turning down the TV, then remove yourself from the situation and find somewhere quieter to study. Does it suck to have to leave your home or find somewhere to work outside the comfort of your own room? Yes. Unfortunately, that is sometimes the case.

You\u2019re right, it\u2019s a bit absurd to be that protective. \n\nOn the other hand, now that I\u2019m older and almost 30, yeah, when I was alone unsupervised as a teenage girl, I *always* had the company or the offer of the company of grown men. Constantly offered rides, given phone numbers, asked for my number, and also have a few stories of (what I now understand to be) severely mentally ill, on hard drugs, or otherwise very sketchy grown men who were already on foot anyway and approached me. \n\n\nLike, teenage girls are in fact a hot commodity lol. I get people don\u2019t like to think about it, but I could give my parents heart attacks on the spot if I listed the number of adults who pressured me to give them my phone number under the guise of being an authority figure, all before I even graduated high school. The more time spent alone, the more opportunities for some stupid stuff to happen. \n\nThat she was (rightfully) probably so angry at the time that she was kicked out probably just made her more likely to agree to do stupid shit with some shady person who pretends to care about what she\u2019s so upset about to gain her trust.\n\n\nWhen I say shady too, bear in mind that my idea of what\u2019s \u2018shady\u2019 vs what\u2019s  \u2018edgy/mysterious/counter culture\u2019 was a lot different from my teenage eyes vs my eyes now. Lots of sketchy, bad news people are absolutely irresistible to teens. I\u2019m not talking about people who everyone would immediately peg as suspect just upon first glance. \n\nSo, from that perspective, ya, the OP made a pretty short sighted decision", "It really depends where they live - not even just in terms of what country or what city, some neighbourhoods and streets are places I wouldn't fancy wandering round even with my husband for added safety. I remember at 16 having to hold hands with my friends to stop one of us being pulled into a car as we were walking together to meet my dad, and we are in what WAS considered to be a safe town at the time. We were lucky in that my dad was already on his way to pick us up and happened to drive round the corner just in time to put the guy off, as soon as dad saw something was going on he honked the horn and the man accelerated off the wrong way down a one way street. I certainly wouldn't send a 14yr old off with no end destination in mind for a few hours, it would take too long to realise there was a problem. In the past couple of months our town has also been the location of the murders of two teenagers (totally unconnected) on their way home from two separate schools and an assault on a school bus, as well as reports of girls being followed by men while walking to or from school so I don't blame anyone for thinking about the danger aspect to this.", "It's this: if anything HAD happened to the niece, aunt would have been blamed. Why didn't OP go to the library to study?", "Depends on where you are to be honest, teenage girls are quite often victims of some pretty heinous crimes. Maybe it\u2019s a really safe place, perhaps it wasn\u2019t though. I think we\u2019d need more info to say for sure.", "Um no I live in one of the safest cities in the state and we still have teenage girls get chased into their houses slaming and locking the doors behind them because of predators", "They can have an opinion, but removing someone(a minor, no less) from a house that doesn't belong to them isn't their choice to make.", "OP and the niece are engaged in a turf war.

The issue is \". I told her this is my home she lives in right now so she needs to respect me and she answered by telling me to stop mooching off my mom and move out\". This is not OP's home any more than it is his niece's home; they are in the same boat - being housed and supported by OP's mom. For as long as OP's brother and niece are there, it is their home too, per the home owner. OP isn't anyone to be taking airs like they are supporting this teenager. Can op shut off the tv? sure. Pretty sure when I was 14, my uncles and aunts could ground me for getting smart with them. Thats not what happened here tho.", "I \"kicked\" my nephew out of my parents house for the same reason. My sister was mad and told my parents. I didn't care and neither did my mom. I told my dad why and he was like, next time tell him. I never had a problem with trying to study again.

You got owned by a 14 year old because she's the only one mature enough to call you out on facts.", "You are not very bright are you? Just because you live there doesn\u2019t make it your home. You are not on the mortgage, pay ANY bills. Your brother and his daughter are literally the same as you. All of you are freeloaders.", "OP was studying. Niece was watching tv. Is it not reasonable for the 14 year old to turn down the tv a bit?", "No, but when her relative is studying and asks her to turn down the TV a bit I don't expect her to act like a toddler.  And I expect her to appreciate that they have a place to stay instead of having to pay for a hotel or being out on the streets because they moved without a plan of where to live.", "Apologies for the long comment. I understand your point but I don't think the problem with the 14 y/o kid is that she doesn't have job. It's that despite OP telling her that they are studying for exams, she kept the volume up. 14 is old enough age to understand that she must lower the volume of the TV when the OP is studying. And yes, even though OP is in college, we don't know the conditions as to why they are living with their mom. There are many college students living with their parents until they graduate. And they did not mention that they don't pay rent. And we can't just assume that they don't just because their niece referred to it \"mooching\".\n\nI believe the problem in this situation is that there are many info missing - have both OP and their niece always had tensions between them? How did OP confront their niece regarding the TV volume? Does the niece always watch TV with volume up or was she being petty knowing that OP is studying? Why couldn't OP just wear headphones? Was OP paying rent to their mom to claim the home theirs? And probably more questions.\n\nEdited to change OP's pronouns because they have not mentioned it in the post. ETA: just found out that OP is old enough to work and pay rent but they don't. Unless there is any personal reasons or any agreements between them and their mom, I agree with you on the fact that OP is an AH for calling it their home.", "Exactly. ESH", "Are you always like this? An AH?", "They live there for now so it's their home too. So by your logic she coulda kicked you out and you'd be ok with it?", "It\u2019s also your brother and niece\u2019s home seeing as they also live there. \n\nYou have no right to kick anyone out of their own home. \n\nYou could have gone to your room, outside, or anywhere else to study.", "It's not the desire, it's the response.\n\nShe has just as much right to be in the house as you do, since you're both not paying rent.\n\nShe can't just take the TV into another room, but you can take your schoolwork into another room.\n\nOr use noise-cancelling headphones, like she suggested.\n\nBut no, you had to kick her out, and now you're taking low blows at her and her dad because you're mad about not getting the quiet that you want (which again, you can facilitate yourself).\n\nYou sure she's rude, or are you just reacting extremely to basic requests?\n\nYTA if it isn't obvious to you.", "Why not just go to the library or a cafe lmao", "They moved into the home, it's her home.", "Until brother finds a permanent residence, then the place they are staying long-term is their home. \n\nA guest implies they have somewhere to go back to eventually.

It's your mom's house.", "YTA, you should already know that, yet here we are. Stop defending yourself and start trying to understand why what you did could have actually been dangerous for your niece.", "It is OPs house.  They are at this time a permanent resident.  Your logic here would imply a housewife has no authority to expect respect of guests at the home she is living in with her husband simply because she's doesn't pay rent.    \n For all intents the Niece and brother are guests in the space.  Circumstances have required them to move there out of the kindness of those living there. Yes the mother has final say, but OP lives there too. Their space is also being encroached upon with this arrangement.  Just because we assume OP doesn't pay rent doesn't mean they should be disrespected and not allowed to study in their own home.", "Well first off, wanting to do something (meaning they didn\u2019t do it) is different from actually doing something. Second, a 14 year old demanding to keep the TV loud is entitled and bratty behavior.

If you need peace and quiet go to the park and do your homework, go to school to do it, go to the library, go to starbucks, put on headphones (like she said to), play your own music at home, go into the backyard, do it in your car, etc.\n\nYou are not her parent, you cannot tell this child what to do and have no authority to kick her out of your mothers house when she has no issues with the child. You do not pay rent just as she does not, the key difference here is she has a valid reason to not be paying rent at this house, as she is 14.\n\nYou are a sad excuse for an adult if you really are reading through all these YTA's and still have the audacity to respond to me dismissively. The only joke in this thread is you.

Her brother perhaps, but until brother dies his kid has no rights to grandma house", "As a father of 2 daughters (23 and 15), I'm aware of this. \n\nThey've been equipped with phones since they started leaving the house, they have to regularly check-in, answer calls from us, and try to be with friends as much as possible.

I walked myself to Starbucks and back to study or hang out with friends or frankly just to get some caffeinated alone time at this age. But I lived in a relatively safe neighborhood, the walk was only about 2 miles one way, and there were a few schools along the path (which meant responsible adults looking out for kids outside most days). It definitely wasn't equivalent to walking around Baltimore or Chicago all by myself.

Maybe something her father should have taught her some time ago.\n\nA 14 year old going outside is not 'abuse' or putting her in any danger, unless of course, they live in a ghetto.", "My friend's daughter was shot on her front porch from a stray shot from a fight that happened at the park across the street...\n\nWhile I know this isn't the reality for everyone nor a regular occurrence, there are some places where it may be more likely than others.", "I don't know about you, but if I'm kicked out of a house, I assume they don't want me in the yard either. Though apparently that's what the niece actually did, per comments, so who knows.", "That isn't their point.\n\nThe point is that we simply don't have enough info to say it's safe or not safe.", "Yes. I think OP lives at my old house. That\u2019s exactly what I said.", "It\u2019s not antiquated. That\u2019s how we old folks were raised. We didn\u2019t have cellphones, we just had bicycles and vague rules like be home before sundown, which in the summer could mean 8-9pm. My friends and I at this age would bike thirty or forty miles a day to random beaches and our parents would have zero clue as to where we were. \n\nThis idea of parents needing to know where their kids   are at all times and being afraid to let them out of their sight is a new phenomena.", "Thinking they automatically do is ridiculous and also how children get harmed.", "Yeah. You're right. So what if she got snatched off the street by a sex trafficker or predator. Jesus Christ. Get a clue.", "Yep. I can show her statistics, pics and video of the area, and tell her how I've been there a ton and it's safe but she refuses to listen and I'm a bad dad for letting him go:(", ">staying with me and my mom for a while until they find a house in our town.\n\nsounds like OP \\*is\\* saying that they're just now moving to the town, so it's \\*highly\\* likely that the girl not only has no friends yet, she probably doesn't know her way around the town either.", "chill, the 90s were not 30 years ago because if they were, that would mean I am... hang on... add the 3, carry the 2... oh f$%k I'm old. I gotta go lie down now", "kids have been getting shot for knocking on doors and turning around in driveways, so no it's not safe to do whatever. and that's ignoring public shootings, sex trafficking, and simple sexual harassment.", "If you say it's safer than it must be.\ud83d\ude44", "BUT THE GROOMERS!!!1!!1!", "There is a difference between allowing a teenager to go out, vs forcing a teenager out and not allowing them back in to the house. I wouldn\u2019t do that to my cat\u2026", "Shit, CPS will respond to 2 kids unattended outside in winter before they respond to actual abuse. It depends on the CPS unit and how seriously they take their job. Most burn out in 5 years. The cost they are to that, the less likely they are to respond to serious stuff, because it's become too much.", "I understand the sentiment, but I\u2019m 99.99% sure that isn\u2019t a legal definition of homelessness anywhere in the world.", "We\u2019re taking OP\u2019s word that it was truly, unreasonably loud? Considering how childish he\u2019s being in the comments, I\u2019m not inclined to believe him. Seems like he just hates his niece and doesn\u2019t accept the home is hers just as much as it is his.", "You don\u2019t need to ask someone for something to be a nuisance.", "Not *silent*, just a bit quieter. It's common courtesy to turn the volume down if someone asks you to.\n\nAnd OP *was* in a separate room but could hear the TV through the door anyway because it was that loud.\n\nIt was hardly an unreasonable request, the kid was a selfish brat, and then OP got stupid and kicked her out.", "That\u2019s\u2026exactly how the world works. \n\nIf you want to only play by your rules, you should live alone. But when you live with others, whether that\u2019s a partner, family, or roommates, it requires compromise.\n\nIdeally, everyone\u2019s needs and wants are satisfied. But in reality, some things take priority. Sometimes someone\u2019s needs are more important than someone\u2019s else wants. And as long as everyone is given reasonably equal consideration overall, it\u2019s not odd for the day to day to be less equal. \n\nSchool is important. If 14 y/o was playing the TV so loudly it was disrupting OP\u2019s wfh, we\u2019d reasonably expect 14 y/o to turn the TV down. \n\nWhat happens when the 14 y/o has her exams? We just as much expect 21 y/o to be considerate with their noise level.\n\nSchool _is_ hard work. It\u2019s not unreasonable to expect your home to be a relatively quiet space where you can study, _especially_ during exam times, which are by definition temporary.\n\nAnd in any case, OP wasn\u2019t even asking 14 y/o to turn off the TV or be silent, just to not have the TV so loud, it can be heard _in other rooms_.", "That \u201cadult\u201d is not the parent nor are they the owner of the house. They acted less of an adult and more like a bratty teenager. The \u201cadult\u201d could\u2019ve put on headphones and had a conversation with the other adults of the house, but they chose to be an asshole. You\u2019re obviously the type to think respect is given, not earned. Hate to break it to you \u201choney\u201d, respect is earned.", "Interesting that you have siblings. I\u2019m an only child, so that probably influences why we feel a certain a way \ud83d\ude42", "Okay but grandma *isn't* dead or incapacitated, so the point is moot.\n\nIf I don't pay rent/utilities somewhere, I have no right to kick anyone out of it who has been invited by the person who does.\n\nRespect for elders is a concept for sure, but so is being the adult in the situation. Throwing a temper tantrum because a teenager is being a teenager is no less childish. She's seven years older than her niece; she isn't old enough yet to pull the 'respect your elders' card, first of all, but she damn sure is old enough to behave like the grown-up in this dynamic. Until she can *act* like an elder, she doesn't get the elder-level respect.", "In that case, you\u2019re just as likely to be hit by a stray bullet going through your window.", "I often got kicked out of the house for a few hours at a time. With my parents/grandparents it was more of \"you are going to go play outside til you've burnt off some energy\"", "That's a weird route to go but ok.", "The way we old folks were raised is part of *why* there was so much crime against kids back then (not recognizing that people you know can be abusers was the other piece). The more protective parenting style was a reaction to that, and is part of why crime is down.", "I was raised that way as well. However...\n\nThe one time I didn't check in by a certain time, the police were called. This was 1995.\n\nSmart parents today recognize that it is important to have some idea where their kids are, and those that go off on their own have a cell phone to contact them with.\n\nI still have rather vague rules: home before dark, if plans change, call and let me know. \n\nI'm saying it's antiquated to think that kids at 14 can't be safe. There were parents like that even when my mom was 14 (1977). It's outdated, especially now with everything they have access to. \n\nOne of mine is out right now. She's at a park. Is she really there? Yup. With friends? Yes. Will she let me know if plans change? Yes. Home before dark? Yes, or escorted by friends that will be staying or getting rides (Park is 3 blocks away).", "So we should just lock all kids up inside and never let them leave the house now?  Do you realize how insane that would be?", "Wow. Worry much?\n\nFun Fact: there were just as many, if not more predators, 30 years ago than now. We didn't have Amber Alerts, a registry, or cell phones then. That's on the news now; it wasn't then. \n\nKids these days are more informed than you think. They know what to watch for. \n\nI'm guessing you're a Boomer or Early Gen X, right? Late Feb X here, the ones that grew up with life experience AND tech knowledge. We've taught our kids everything we know, and there are less kids going missing every year because they aren't sheltered, they are connected, and they know the signs. We just had that vague \"Stranger danger\" crap, with an emphasis on drugs more than anything else.\n\nYOU get a clue.", "Sensationalized instances are not reflective of statistical trends.", "And yet theres less of ALL of this than there was 30 years ago. You just werent paying attention to it then. Youre literally mentioning the rare occurrences that make the news. This is shile ignoring thatthis kid was in a backyard. Not the street. \n\n\nBut no it is not more dangerous thzn 30 years ago. Soneone already posted the data. Try stepping outside to see how rare danger actually is. And i say this as a latin american trans person in the use who was very much alive for the 1990s. You know, the tail end of the cocaine era in miami where the cops told you they cannot protect you and go get a gun. I was alive for that. That was my childhood. We are no where close to that. Get a grip.", "Where does OP say that they're black?", "[Here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/191219/reported-violent-crime-rate-in-the-usa-since-1990/) is a link to a Statista graph showing the trend of reported\\* violent crimes in the United States since 1990. It has trended downwards.\n\n\\*ETA qualifying term.", "Try looking up crime statistics, bud. Violent crome over all has seen a steady decline over the last 40 years", "If only we'd been tracking crime statistics this whole time and can easily see that it is, in fact, safer now than 30 years ago\n\nOh wait we have and we can", "Statistics say it is. Violent crime has trended downwards for 30 to 40 years. It's safer now more than ever also because they have a device that can be tracked and has a way to instantly communicate with them. You didn't play outside because you were absorbed in your devices and your parents didn't make you because you weren't bothering them, not because it was unsafe. We used to get sent outside to play because we weren't glued to devices and we were annoying our parents while they were trying to get stuff done.", "It totally depends on where you live.  Downtown in My area 30 years ago was a dangerous place and 20 years before that it was even worse. Today it's a pretty safe place.", "Sorry, can\u2019t reply, went outside and got murdered twice.", "That\u2019s the US Federal definition", "It\u2019s a communal room. You can\u2019t expect it to be quiet. Most people that study, do so in a place they know will be quiet. The kid has just as much right as OP to be in the house making noise, neither of them pay rent. OP should\u2019ve moved, it\u2019s not that fucking difficult really is it? \n\n\nLike I said, any actual adult in this situation would\u2019ve removed themselves from it.", "Where does it say anything about other rooms? OP made it sound like they were sat in the same room.\n\nAnd as for when the 14 year old goes through exams, I\u2019m sure she can also sit in a private room if she needs quiet lmao just like OP could\u2019ve done?", "It isn\u2019t a moot point. She has a 50% stake in the estate, it just hasn\u2019t vested. The kid has none while dad is alive. \n\nRegardless, If I were an adult living in my parents house, that I was born and raised in and my niece or nephew came in and starting talking shit and causing trouble I would definitely set the kid straight and or tell them to take a hike.  The kid sounds like a self entitled brat.  \n\nThis is insane. Im trying to study for my finals and sone kid comes in disrespecting me in the house I live in and I the ass because I told her to stfu?  That\u2019s some twisted shit. Guess just agree to disagree, but I\u2019d love to see how some folks that thinks she is the ass would act if it were the house they grew up in", "Bit of a different scenario there", "When I was like 3 my mom would get sick of me existing and make me lay outside on the un-heated (I'm in Maine) porch for hours until my dad got home.", "\" there was so much crime against kids back then\"\n\nI'm going to need to see your statistics because as somebody who grew up \"back then\" It was just as safe as it is now.\n\nThe only thing that changed is parents turned into helicopter parents after seeing every horrible possible thing that could happen on social media or the news.\n\nKids are grown up without having to have learned how to navigate the world as a individual and when they move out of the house everything is very overwhelming to them.\n\nIt's not the world, it is them.", "I wouldn't give it that much credit for crime being down, but okay. \n\nI think it's more the ability for kids to access information themselves through their devices. They see the world for what it is, not the rose-tinted glasses we saw it through, where nothing went wrong. \n\nWe didn't have Amber Alerts. They do. We didn't hear about missing kids on the news, they do. We only saw milk carton pictures, but had zero details.", "It is not.\n\nhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/11302\n\nIf they were hopping between various family members\u2019 places and always reasonably expected eviction in the short term (<14 days), it would.
