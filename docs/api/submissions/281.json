We have a five year old daughter, Ava, and I'm 6 months pregnant with a boy. Chris also has a son from a previous marriage, Alex (16M), who lives with us full-time since his mom passed away 2 years ago. Previously they had 50/50 custody. Alex and I used to get along fine, but I've always handled our relationship with kid gloves, especially after his mother's sudden death.\n\nWe started having problems with Alex once we told the kids about the new baby. His grades have fallen significantly, he's hardly ever at home, and when he is home, he has been hostile towards Chris and I. Chris has sworn that Alex has just going through an \"asshole teenager\" phase and that he would get over it eventually... In his own words, \"Alex is just angry at everything right now.\"\n\nSo, the other day while Chris was at work and I was at home with the kids, Alex and I got into an argument over dishes that he left in the sink. The argument ended with Alex yelling in my face to leave him alone, telling me that I'm not his mom, calling me a bitch, and slamming his door (Chris usually handles situations like this).\n\nHowever, Alex came to me a few minutes later in tears saying that he feels like nobody cares about him anymore, nobody loves him, and that he feels like his dad and I are going to forget about him once we have the baby. I was shocked because I haven't seen Alex so emotional before. I hugged him and we cried together, I told him that his dad and I are always going to love him, that we're never going to forget about him, and that he's just as important as everyone else in the family.\n\nAfter we were both calmed down I told Alex he can't yell and be aggressive with me or anyone like he has been, that it isn't healthy. He promised that he wouldn't do it again, and I even talked to him about going to therapy. The rest of the day was fine, \\*and he cleaned his dishes.\\*\n\nWhen I told Chris about what happened, he was livid that I \"let Alex disrespect (me)\" and I let him \"manipulate\" me with tears, and that I was too soft with Alex given his behavior... That he was going to have another talk with him and he was getting grounded.\n\nI explained that Alex was being genuine, and that nobody was in danger, and that I think that a hug from his dad and reassuring words would probably help Alex more than punishing him. Chris said that I'm not Alex's parent, and that I need to let him handle things with Alex from now on.\n\nChris and I are at a crossroads right now over this because he doesn't think that I can handle Alex's behavior correctly, and that he's not going to do better unless there are consequences for when he acts out. I feel like Chris needs to be more compassionate towards his son and not treat him like a troubled teen. Also, I think it's ridiculous that Chris wants to handle every situation with Alex, even if he is not present.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667168937, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhs39f/aita_for_how_i_handled_a_situation_with_my/", "score": 350, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This was your stepson actually finally admitting what\u2019s been bothering him. He was not manipulating you with tears. He needs therapy. Love and attention. He lost his mom. Now he\u2019s terrified he\u2019s going to lose his dad and you when the new baby comes. You did the right thing not getting mad at him and reassuring him once he came back. He needed that. See a family therapist. Get him in individual. And your husband I know is frustrated but he needs to remember his son lost his mom. And is terrified of losing him too", "NTA -- HELP --- Alex is asking for help.  He needs tools to understand what he is experiencing and better ways to express his emotions. Depression in males often present as Fing anger.  So proud of him telling you what he is experiencing.  Please get him help...you parents too.  Therapy: A place to express concerns, learn skills..see the light that things can 'feel' better (this is hope). He has had little to no control of major life events then 'Bam' here's another change. Best to you...you all.", "NTA\nIs your husband that bad with your child together's emotions?", "NTA I personally agree with how you handled this and think you're a wonderful kind soul this kid is lucky to have as a step mom during this hard time", "NTA. I can't possibly see where you've gone wrong with how you handled Alex. He came to you vulnerable and you embraced him.\n\nThe 'not his parent' line kind of makes Chris the AH. Alex needs a maternal figure and the wife of his dad/mother of his younger siblings with a compassionate heart is the ticket.", "NTA.   Well done with how you handled the situation with Chris!   Too bad for Chris (and for you) that his father is an asshole.", "NTA does he truly believe a boy\u2019s mom can die when he\u2019s 14 and everything will be fine? Yes, he needs therapy. Yes, a new baby - especially a boy - is going to be hard on him. Is your husband that unwavering and unfeeling with your daughter? With you? He might benefit from some parenting classes or counseling himself.", "NTA\n\nYou did perfectly, and I applaud you. No wonder Alex is having a difficult time. First of, he's 16 yrs old, that's difficult enough. But then he has lost his mom, and full time lives in with his \"stepfamily\". He needs to know exactly what you told him, that he is as important as any other Member of the family\n\nI would suggest to talk to your husband. Usually I agree with the \"you are not the parent, so you don't parent the kid\". But he lives full time with you and his mom died. This is different.", "You handled the situation beautifully. That was EXACTLY what Alex needed. I hope you can all go to family therapy, but if not, please at least privately let Alex know you have his back, regardless of what his dad does. Spend some special time with him when dad isn't around, and keep communication open with him. Poor kid lost his mom and needs someone in his corner.  \nTotally NTA", "NTA\n\nYou are in a shitty position\n\nFrom you description, it sounds like Alexs apology was genuine and that he opened up about his feelings. Punishing him would be a mistake.  Chris having a calm, heartfelt conversation with Alex about how he\u2019s not going to be forgotten and he\u2019s loved; that it\u2019s not ok to lash out at you like that but it\u2019s good he recognized he was wrong and owned up to you it.\n\nIts not fair that Chris told you that you\u2019re not Alex\u2019s parent. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re trying to take Alexs moms role, but you are in fact his parent", "NTA. You handled this perfectly. Textbook perfect. I don't know what hubby's problem is.", "NTA but your husband is. After completely sorting the situation calmly between you, your husband's solution is to go and tell him off and ground him for how he spoke to you?! That's not going to help one bit. And then to say that you're not Alex's parent?! I'd tell him that you are all the time he's not acting like one. Stop being a brat Chris and be a good, calm sympathetic father.", "NTA I think you did amazingly. He probably needs some grief counseling. Loosing a parent is hard. You all could benefit from family therapy also", "Your husband is the asshole. You did the right thing. Thank you for stepping up for this child.", ">I feel like Chris needs to be more compassionate towards his son and not treat him like a troubled teen.\n\n\nPersonally, I would agree with you there.\n16 is still so young and I can see how the baby coming would make your stepson feel insecure - especially considering the loss of his mother.\n\n\n\nI hope your husband comes to see that there are times to be strict and \"lay down the law\", and times to be reassuring and forgiving.\n\n\n\nBest of luck, OP..!\n\n\n\nNTA", "NTA. There are points where it's far more constructive to say what's eating away at you rather than bottling it up because if you keep if inside it comes out as microaggressions and straight up aggression, as is what happened. Alex doing so helped you to understand what he was feeling, and in turn assure him his fears were unfounded.", "NTA. Sounds like Alex is still grieving actually. You don\u2019t need to be his mother figure, you can be his friend though", "NTA - You may not be his mother but you are his parent... it sounds like you are a pretty good one.", "NTA. I think you handled the situation with your stepson admirably.", "Not his parent?? You've been around for 14 of the 16 years the kid has been alive, been a stepmother for 6 years, and his only mother for two years. HOW MUCH MORE INVOLVED DO YOU HAVE TO BE BEFORE YOUR HUSBAND RESPECTS YOUR POSITION AS A PARENT?? Blood and biology are not the only factors for being a parent.\n\nThank you for listening to Alex. It's what he needs right now. Your husband, on the other hand, needs to see some consequences for HIS actions.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. My heart goes out to a child who has lost one parent and feels replaceable by the other parent. I think you handled it very well. Would Chris consent to allowing Alex to go to therapy? He needs to discuss everything he has gone through and a professional therapist would be a great place to do that.", "NTA. Alex\u2019s behavior will not improve if your husband continues to react like that. You did the right thing.", "Your husband is being a prize prick, you sorted the situation exactly how it needed to be, he should be thanking you, that you took the time as his step mum to truly understand him sn not blow it off as not worth it, maybe therapy for the husband as well to get hom to adjust to a blended family", "NTA. It sounds like Alex needed some reassurance, and that's what you gave him. Your husband is TA. His son is seeing that his father treats his daughter differently, and he lost his mom. That poor kid! Be there for him.", "NTA\n\nYou handled this so beautifully, with respect for Alex and his mother and his grief. Alex lives in your house permanently - your husband can\u2019t make all disciplinary decisions himself, especially those that need to be decided and acted upon in the moment like this one.\n\nI\u2019m glad that Alex is considering therapy but I think your husband should consider it too.\n\nThank you for making a safe space in which Alex could come to you and be vulnerable like that.", "So NTA. Unlike most of the blended families on here , you seemed to have let your relationship develop naturally and not pushed him. You were in a good place . Them some things happened in his life . His mother died , he is a teenager, you\u2019re having another child. He is probably hurting, confused and doesn\u2019t know where to turn . He finally opened back up to you with his feelings because he does trust you. His father needs to understand all of this and where Alex is coming from", "NTA!!!! teenage feelings are massive and all he needs right now is support. his actual father needs to shape up", "NTA\n\nI get that Chris would prefer to handle parenting his son.  But you're not new in his life and despite going through an \"@sshole phase\" or not kids still need to be hugged and loved on.  If Chris isn't giving his son the positive attention and affection he needs where will he get it?  His mom is gone so you are now is mother figure.  It's absolutely natural that he'd come to you for that needed mom care and talk more frankly about his feelings.  \n\nWhile I'm sure Chris is a good Dad he sounds like a suck it up and deal parent.  Which doesn't lend itself to being open to talking about feelings.  He needs to think about his parenting style with Alex.  \n\nYou did what was right for Alex.  You reassured him he's not forgotten, he's not being replaced.  He's just as loved and wanted and this new little one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would even go so far as to have another private conversation with him that regardless of what his dad says you are there for him and he can trust you. I would then discriminate on discussing topics with his dad, if you can have conversations with your step son and he can learn emotional intelligence from it and develop a trusting relationship well into his adult years you may be the person to plant seeds of successful emotional regulation and relationship communication for him. Sometimes these seeds of suggestion take the 10yrs. I see it all the time in aged out youth. They will reach out and thank me for the compassion and earnest apologies I\u2019ve expressed for my mistakes while I verbally corrected myself or they took my advice finally and they see what my point was.

Husband sounds more like the asshole here.\n\nI cannot stress to you enough how much more important it is to try and understand your child rather than just punishing them. 99% of the time, when a child / teenager is acting this way, it isn't simply a phase. They are coping with massive things happening in their minds that they don't know how to properly deal with. You can see this with Alex RIGHT NOW. You are entirely correct that a hug and reassuring words are what Alex needs from his father, not punishment. One \"We understand, and we are sorry.\" would have changed my life at 16. You know what changed nothing at all? Getting grounded/punished/yelled at/etc. Alex getting punished for this is going to cause him to be more emotionally detached than ever, which will cause more emotions that he doesn't know how to properly deal with, which will lead to more behaviors exhibited by the \"asshole teenager\" 'phase' (Its not a phase, mom..... literally). \n\nKudos to Alex for having the strength to come up to you like that - I could never do that.

Absolutely NTA, how he can't see that his son's behavior could very easily be explained by all the turmoil/change currently in his life is beyond me.", "NTA and to be honest the kid probably 100% needs someone to talk to like a therapist. Angry teenager phase does not account for losing a parent. Your husband should think about that.", "NTA. Daddy needs to let step mommy deal with this one. It's her call. Work On the rest as family.", "NTA. And you definitely have a parenting role. You\u2019ve been there since Alex was 8 years old. And now your his only mother figure. I would personally be offended that your husband thinks you aren\u2019t a parent now. Especially since y\u2019all have children together. If your husband punishes your son have a talk with him later and let him know that you\u2019re on his side and that you care.", "NTA. You didn't overstep, you enforced boundaries in your own home that you would not be yelled at that way. It clearly worked, Alex understood and connected with you, and he cleaned the dishes. What more does his dad want? \n\nFWIW I think you should keep doing what you're doing and not worry too much about your husband's reaction. Alex is 16, you and he get to dictate the terms of your own relationship. Don't interfere in consequences his dad gives him, but interact with Alex on your own terms and you two will build a strong relationship.", "Him thinking this baby represents his father's replacement family isn't an unreasonable concern. If his father subscribes to the idea that showing emotion is weakness no wonder he's learned to bottle things up. OP is being a better parental figure to Alex than his own father.\n\nIt was probably because Chris wasn't around Alex calmed down on his own and apologised, opening up about his fears.", "NTA. That kid is crying out for help. He needs therapy asap. Also the family, especially the dad needs therapy as he is the AH.", "I think it also speaks volumes that Alex went to OP about how he was feeling rather than his father. His father dismisses and invalidate his emotions, while OP comforted him and made him feel heard. I feel like this isn\u2019t the first time OP\u2019s husband invalidated Alex\u2019s feelings.\n\nOP, keep being a safe place for Alex to open up. Especially with the loss of his mom and his fears related to your growing family, he\u2019s going to need someone who\u2019s willing to listen to him.\n\nNTA", "He confided in the person he knew would take the time to listen and understand which says alot about his dad.\n\nHe should sit up and take note", "This. 100% this. Amen.", "He's never even raised his voice at our daughter. He honestly wasn't even so harsh with Alex until he started acting out.", "Not his parent? Correct. You are Alex\u2019s stepmom and he came to you vulnerable and left reassured. Chris needs to face reality. If he keeps going this way Alex will be moved out and gone forever and it will be Chris\u2019s fault.", "I agree completely with this.  You are NTA at all, and you handled it as well as you possibly could have.  I find it very disturbing that your husband goes right to thinking his son is trying to manipulate you by crying.  If that were really what was going on, he would not have actually done the dishes, and would have tried to get something out of you other than the simple comfort you provided.\n\nHe is acting like his son is a troubled teen acting out for no reason other that being a teenager, but that is far from the truth.  The feelings Chris expressed to you are completely understandable under the circumstances, and it took a lot of guts for him to share them with you.\n\nI could understand your husband wanting to make all the decisions regarding Chris if you were not married, but you are married and you are his step mother.  You have every right to parent him as needed when his father is not around.", ">Is your husband that unwavering and unfeeling with your daughter? With you? He might benefit from some parenting classes or counseling himself.\n\nHe's not like this with anyone but Alex, and he wasn't even this harsh with him until he started acting out and being aggressive. I really believe that my husband doesn't see the big picture with the issues that Alex is having.", "On top of this, if the husband\u2019s reaction is that Alex is using his \u201ctears to manipulate\u201d OP, then no wonder Alex has trouble expressing his feelings.", "Hostile as in talking back to my husband and I, slamming doors, yelling, one time he punched a wall but all he did was end up hurting his hand. He's never been violent towards anyone, just angry. He's harmless... and I really think it's a stretch to say that he would hurt the baby.", "Not at all. Heck, I see similar thing\u2019s constantly at work. Kids acting out due to life changes. especially if parents aren\u2019t affectionate. His blow up was his purge. The crying was the emotional clarity moment and final purge moment after where he expressed what was actually behind his behavior. I see it literally all the time where kids and adults will BLOW up about something silly when really the cause isn\u2019t why they\u2019re actually blowing up. But the blow up let\u2019s them vent enough to be able to open up about what\u2019s really wrong.", "Thxs...I really could not help myself.", "You need to drag your husband into counselling also, he's behaving in a very dangerous way towards Alex. At best Alex stops talking to either of you and moves out as soon as he can. AT BEST. He could hurt himself I'm a 1000 ways in the meantime if he isn't getting the support he needs at home in his fear and grief. Your husband needs a reality check about how he is treating his boy.", "The reply below makes a good point, but specifically also makes me wonder - how is your husband with *Alex's* emotions? You've known that kid for 6- 8ish years and this is the first time you've seen him emotionally vulnerable?\n\n(Also, your husband's \"you're not his parent\" is majorly concerning to me as a foreshadow, I say in aside. Counseling would be a good place to hash that one out too.)", "NTA and I would show him this post but I doubt his ego could deal with it. \n\n\u201cListen, you\u2019re a good man. I wouldn\u2019t be married to you if you weren\u2019t, and I certainly would not have children with you.\"\n\n\u201cHowever, we are not in the same situation we were. We have two children and one on the way. And Alex\u2018s mother has died and he needs to feel like we love him and he has a place here. And if we don\u2019t handle this right, we!, You will lose him.\"\n\n\u201cAlex expressed emotions and any casual observation of kids will show that they act out when they\u2019re having a problem. It\u2019s one thing to have expectations for your kids, and it\u2019s another for not letting them express their emotions, apologize for their behavior, and correct it. And he did all of those things.\"\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m going to gently tell you that I am now something to Alex, I can\u2019t replace his mom and I would never try to. But you are not a single parent, and I hope that you can give me the credit that I was not manipulated. And I fear if this is how you feel when children express their emotions what would happen to our kids when they act out and express emotions.\"\n\n\u201cAlex needs therapy and I\u2019m going to schedule family therapy for all of us and we will all participate. I don\u2019t want to come off as being difficult to you but this is really important to me and it\u2019s a dealbreaker if we don\u2019t do it.\"\n\n\"I simply will not watch our family not meld and our children not have their older brother or have an unhappy one. it\u2019s very common for older kids from the first marriage to feel replaced, he doesn\u2019t have his mother, but he does have us - which includes his father. I am begging you to please be there with him and for him and have an open mind, talk with him and for God'ssake listen to him and validate him.\"\n\n\u201cLook at it this way, you\u2019re unhappy with this conversation and you\u2019re a grown man. Imagine being a teenager with a deceased mother living in a home that he doesn\u2019t feel is his, with a father who doesn\u2019t try to understand him, and a bunch of replacement kids on the way. you\u2019re expecting more of him than you are of yourself. I am begging you, I know the type of man you are so I am expecting you to please let us work together so that we can have a strong and happy family.\"", "Yes, it's a real danger when parents turn to rigid punishment with teens instead of offering encouragement and understanding. Driving a teen further away into their own anger, fear and agony can lead to worse behavior and trouble. The kids who act out can be sent away to boot camps and other prisons, and this is even worse. I have read some real horror stories. Love and understanding is the best way for the whole family. Creating a bad guy or scapegoat will make life much worse for everyone. Chris is clearly being unrealistic. He must have unresolved issues that he needs to address inside himself.", "Thankfully for Alex you do OP hopefully you can get Chris to see it before it\u2019s to late, the fact you couldn\u2019t been that angry what Alex did and shut back at him when he come back but you didn\u2019t you seen him open up to you that\u2019s him also letting you know he trusts you and loves you too he just doesn\u2019t know how to do with all those feels he\u2019s got Thank you for being there for your son", "Yeah, I hope dad doesn't use this phrase towards Alex. That's proper trauma right there.", "I totally agree he is bottling it all up witch isn\u2019t a god thing or healthy way to go", "Agree the husband reaction is odd and definitely needs a reality check, his son has lost his mother and his first reaction is to ground the child when OP had a breakthrough in getting Alex to open up.  At least OP supporting Alex emotionally.", "Am just glad that\u2019s dad wasn\u2019t there at the time of it am pretty sure the son wouldn\u2019t have opened up to what\u2019s he truly feeling OP your doing right I just hope you can convince the dad your husband to calm down and see the his son is calling out for help as you did and gets him the help"]}
