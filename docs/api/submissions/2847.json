I know people always love to exaggerate and say their dog is so loving regardless of whatever their dog's true personality is. My dog is friendly towards my family and people he's familiar with. But he's very aloof towards strangers. He doesn't bark towards strangers but will have a low growl if he's patted/touched without the proper introduction.\n\nSo anyway for the party, I decided the best solution was to have him kept upstairs on the 2nd/3rd floor, with a dog gate installed at the stairs. The party will be confined to the first floor and the garden. \n\nHalfway during the party, my son and his 2 friends wanted to go upstairs to see my dog. These 2 friends have come over to my house frequently and 3 of them have spent unsupervised time around my dog without any incidents for the past 2 years. They are very aware of the rules and boundaries I've set. They can go play fetch and stuff with him but they are never to play with his tail or face or try to sit on him. \n\nAnother boy (let's call him B) and his mum apparently heard that my dog was upstairs and wanted to head up too. I said nope, sorry, my dog doesn't play too well with people he doesn't know and I can't be around upstairs all the time. B's mum insisted that it will be fine and her son loves playing with dogs etc. I cut her off and said nah, another time, and directed them both towards the other toys/party stuff going on. \n\nLess than 5 minutes later, I hear some barking and some screaming from upstairs. I run up to see B crying and his mum yelling at my dog and me. All sorts of accusations were hurled at me, including having a rabid dog, untrained dog and she said she was going to ensure my dog was put down. \n\nI tried to ask the other kids (my son and his friends) what happened. So, it turns out that B and his mother came up on their own and while my dog was lying in one corner, he decided to go over and start pulling his tail, even though the other kids told him not to. His mother waved them off and allowed B to continue. That resulted in my dog getting up, and barking at them as well as growling. I checked B for any injuries and found none. My CCTV recording showed exactly what my son and his friends had described and there was no contact between my dog and the boy at any point. \n\nB's mum brought him to the doctor anyway for a full checkup (no injuries found) and wanted me to compensate for that along with apologizing for the incident. I said no, and she would be lucky if I didn't pursue anything about trespassing into my house's upper floors.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1668997957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0mz8f/aita_for_not_apologizing_for_my_dog_scaring_off/", "score": 549, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For some odd reason, some people consider themselves to be dog whisperers, yet want to blame the owner when the dog reacts exactly as the owner said it would, and dog breeds with aggressive reputations often are immediately blamed for any incident even if the human acted in a way they were explicitly told not to.

Long story short, when he tried to pet her when she was guarding her puppies, she bit him on the face. He needed stitches, but admitted it was entirely his fault for harassing a nursing mother dog when warned over and over not to go in the room where she and her babies were. You told her to stay away and any sensible person would have heeded your instructions and not put her kids at risk. She is lucky that she and her kids weren\u2019t bitten after abusing the dog!

If your dog just barked at strangers I wouldn't worry, but a low growl with no bark is usually a precursor of a bite. Dogs have many ways of showing discomfort, most are subtle (looking away, whale eye, pinned ears etc), and when these are consistently disregarded they start going straight to a growl.
