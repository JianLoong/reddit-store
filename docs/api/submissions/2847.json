I know people always love to exaggerate and say their dog is so loving regardless of whatever their dog's true personality is. My dog is friendly towards my family and people he's familiar with. But he's very aloof towards strangers. He doesn't bark towards strangers but will have a low growl if he's patted/touched without the proper introduction.\n\nSo anyway for the party, I decided the best solution was to have him kept upstairs on the 2nd/3rd floor, with a dog gate installed at the stairs. The party will be confined to the first floor and the garden. \n\nHalfway during the party, my son and his 2 friends wanted to go upstairs to see my dog. These 2 friends have come over to my house frequently and 3 of them have spent unsupervised time around my dog without any incidents for the past 2 years. They are very aware of the rules and boundaries I've set. They can go play fetch and stuff with him but they are never to play with his tail or face or try to sit on him. \n\nAnother boy (let's call him B) and his mum apparently heard that my dog was upstairs and wanted to head up too. I said nope, sorry, my dog doesn't play too well with people he doesn't know and I can't be around upstairs all the time. B's mum insisted that it will be fine and her son loves playing with dogs etc. I cut her off and said nah, another time, and directed them both towards the other toys/party stuff going on. \n\nLess than 5 minutes later, I hear some barking and some screaming from upstairs. I run up to see B crying and his mum yelling at my dog and me. All sorts of accusations were hurled at me, including having a rabid dog, untrained dog and she said she was going to ensure my dog was put down. \n\nI tried to ask the other kids (my son and his friends) what happened. So, it turns out that B and his mother came up on their own and while my dog was lying in one corner, he decided to go over and start pulling his tail, even though the other kids told him not to. His mother waved them off and allowed B to continue. That resulted in my dog getting up, and barking at them as well as growling. I checked B for any injuries and found none. My CCTV recording showed exactly what my son and his friends had described and there was no contact between my dog and the boy at any point. \n\nB's mum brought him to the doctor anyway for a full checkup (no injuries found) and wanted me to compensate for that along with apologizing for the incident. I said no, and she would be lucky if I didn't pursue anything about trespassing into my house's upper floors.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1668997957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0mz8f/aita_for_not_apologizing_for_my_dog_scaring_off/", "score": 976, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For some odd reason, some people consider themselves to be dog whisperers, yet want to blame the owner when the dog reacts exactly as the owner said it would, and dog breeds with aggressive reputations often are immediately blamed for any incident even if the human acted in a way they were explicitly told not to.

Long story short, when he tried to pet her when she was guarding her puppies, she bit him on the face. He needed stitches, but admitted it was entirely his fault for harassing a nursing mother dog when warned over and over not to go in the room where she and her babies were.

Save the CCTV grabs, and contact a lawyer if you feel the need. \n\nShe has crossed your dogs boundaries, and disregarded your privacy. By those actions she has endangered her own child.", "NTA you said no and she ignored you. Also, why would she say her kid is good with dogs and then Pull your dog\u2019s tail? That\u2019s not ok even for a dog who does like kids! In the future though, I would tell my son and close friends that they couldn\u2019t play with the dog until after the party was over to avoid saying yes to some kids and no to others", "NTA. That said, I'd have kept all kids away from the dog during the party to avoid this scenario.", "NTA for not apologizing and she should consider herself and her son lucky they learned that lesson the easy way. \n\nIt is messed up to let some kids do something at the party (play with dog) and not others, though. Especially with 7 year olds, that seemed bound to happen, just surprised there was a parent around when it did", "NTA. The audacity of that woman. If she tries to press charges in anyway, you have recorded footage and she was trespassing as well as throw in child endangerment and animal abuse. Her kid is going to get bit one day and I guarantee it will be the mothers fault.", "NTA at all.", "NTA", "NTA. You literally put your dog in a segregated section of the house away from everyone else. A whole floor away from everyone else. Your dog was well behaved if all it did was bark and growl at two strangers. I would blacklist this woman from my house.", "I came here totally ready to say you're the asshole, based on the title. But as everyone pretty much agrees, you're NTA. \n\nI'm really sensitive regarding dogs being scary (esp. to kids) and lots of people are too nonchalant about letting their dogs get too close. \n\nBut I would be LIVID if someone went into a part of my house that I forbade, even after expressly explaining why.\n\nHowever, it probably would have been best to make a blanket rule, keeping EVERYONE away from the dog, rather than having some exceptions.", "\"A low growl when touched\" IS NOT \"aloof towards strangers.\" Honestly, a bark is a MILLION times better than a LOW GROWL when TOUCHED WRONG. That's full on \"shouldn't be allowed near strangers AT ALL without FULL supervision.\"", "NTA. \n\nYou kept your dog away from the party, explicitly told her not to go upstairs and that your dog wasn't good with strangers and she ignored you and did whatever she wanted.\n\nShe should apologize to you, your dog and her own kid for putting him at risk.", "Its what he deserves", "NTA My father has a dog who is very temperamental, he just likes me, not even my dad can stand it so if my dad wants to bring someone he has to ask me to spend some time with him. He is a Great Dane. And honestly I think this is very irresponsible, because she didn't even think if the dog was violent even with the warnings she received from the other children, it could have ended in death.", "I\u2019m willing to go with YTA - for not protecting your dog from this kid.  IF any of those kids had gone too far with your dog and gotten bitten, through their own fault! - your dog would STILL be put down.", "I would suggest taking them to court, for emotional damage of the dog and you. As well as tresspassing", "The lawyer part should like an excellent plan given the potential disaster on both sides.", "OP should NOT let this be a cheap lesson.\n\nTrespassing, animal abuse, child endangerment, and basically being an insufferable know-nothing.. though that last one isn\\`t a legal definition...", "I agree with this statement. They all needed to stay downstairs. \n\nIE if you had a pool in the back yard and told everyone \u201cstay out of the pool\u201d and then allowed just those couple boys into the pool meanwhile telling everyone \u201cyou haven\u2019t been here often enough to understand my pool rules so stay out of it\u201d that would be hurtful and rude. Same situation.\n\nUltimately the other mother is to blame for this situation but it could have possibly been avoided if everyone stayed downstairs and no mention was made of the dog.", "I have a very cute small dog who hates everyone except me, my husband, and our son. I\u2019ve had a few kids ask to pet him over the years, but only one really sticks out. I had to essentially run away from an extremely stupid pre-teen boy who wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. First, he didn\u2019t ask, just started walking toward us with eyes locked on my dog. I said don\u2019t try to pet him, he\u2019s not friendly. My dog was giving very clear \u201cstay away from me\u201d signals you\u2019d have to be blind AND deaf to miss. Little idiot actually followed my snarling, barking dog for the equivalent of half a block shouting \u201cI just want to let him sniff me!\u201d WTF. Some people deserve to be bitten, but it\u2019s not going to be my dog.\n\nLuckily for me everyone I actually know respects the rules for (not) interacting with him, and every other kid who\u2019s been tempted to pet changed their mind when I said no and he started growling.", "Right but it\u2019s up to the adults to see these situations and steer the kids in the right direction so they don\u2019t get hurt. Like how OP did and the mom did not.\n\nNTA", ">There was no injuries or maliciousness.\n\nI disagree there. Injured entitled ego of that (beep), and maybe a hurt tail.   \nAnd maliciousness on the part of (again) that (beep) - she ignored a no (repeated no even) and trespassed, and ignored warnings of others present, and allowed her kid to abuse the dog (by pulling its tail).  You cannot say she was not malicious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe dog - yeah - poor thing - hope he\\`s doing okay.", "I don\u2019t know. I dislike when strangers walk up to me, grab part of my body, and start pulling, does that make me \u201cpeople-aggressive?\u201d", "Maybe, just maybe, that was why there was a rule about not going near the dog, and it was behing a closed gate (usually more diffcult for children to open than a door)", "She was told NO.  \nShe trespassed. She (allowed her child to) abuse the dog. \n\nI think that a lawyer would ask \"you sure about this, cause OP has #1/2/3 to bring against you and you\\`d lose\"\n\nFrankly, OP SHOULD file these complaints with the police - as a paper trail maybe, or a precaution.", ">She got what she deserved.\n\nNot yet. She deserves a trespassing report, an animal abuse report, and neglecting the safety of her child report.", "B's mum is lucky she doesn't get anything for trespassing as she was explicitly told not to go up there.", "found the mom? or the tail pulling kid?", "With the (beeps) demand for 'compensation'  I think you\\`re right.", "Precisely this. I have an absolute sweetheart of a dog, she loves kids and is so, so gentle with them. So the way I see it, I have to protect her from kids being rough with her, even though she only walks away if she gets uncomfortable. I don't want her to be in a situation where she gets uncomfortable in the first place, so kids are strictly supervised at all times. \nEven with a dog like mine, who'd do everything in her power to not harm anyone, especially a child, she could bite. If a human wouldn't let her walk away, if they crowded her, held her, pulled her tail, and didn't listen to her signals (body language and growl) she could bite them to get away. Probably just a nip, like a dog would do to correct a puppy, but a parent like this entitled mother could then potentially have my dog put down. \nWhich is exactly why OP had her dog upstairs, to prevent a situation like this. It makes me furious, because animals get hurt and even killed due to entitled and ignorant people.", "A little unsual that a dog with that temperament would be used for breeding.", "Lucky. Normally when a dog bites, they say 'ooh, evil dog , kill it'.", "Not comfy around strangers without proper introduction as per OP.\n\nMeaning - the owner needs to introduce a new person and inform the dog 'this person is okay'.   \nGuarding his family is a better term 'he\\`s protective of us around unknowns'.\n\nBy using aggressive like the person above you suggested, you immediately label your dog as \"dangerous\" to people who panic easily.\n\nFunny thing, i\\`m uncomfortable around strangers, but when I growl my coworkers usually say \"that\\`s our IT guy, feed him coffee and/or chocolate and he\\`ll like you' and no one ever makes a point of that. Funny that with dogs everyone is an expert.."]}
