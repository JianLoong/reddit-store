I know people always love to exaggerate and say their dog is so loving regardless of whatever their dog's true personality is. My dog is friendly towards my family and people he's familiar with. But he's very aloof towards strangers. He doesn't bark towards strangers but will have a low growl if he's patted/touched without the proper introduction.\n\nSo anyway for the party, I decided the best solution was to have him kept upstairs on the 2nd/3rd floor, with a dog gate installed at the stairs. The party will be confined to the first floor and the garden. \n\nHalfway during the party, my son and his 2 friends wanted to go upstairs to see my dog. These 2 friends have come over to my house frequently and 3 of them have spent unsupervised time around my dog without any incidents for the past 2 years. They are very aware of the rules and boundaries I've set. They can go play fetch and stuff with him but they are never to play with his tail or face or try to sit on him. \n\nAnother boy (let's call him B) and his mum apparently heard that my dog was upstairs and wanted to head up too. I said nope, sorry, my dog doesn't play too well with people he doesn't know and I can't be around upstairs all the time. B's mum insisted that it will be fine and her son loves playing with dogs etc. I cut her off and said nah, another time, and directed them both towards the other toys/party stuff going on. \n\nLess than 5 minutes later, I hear some barking and some screaming from upstairs. I run up to see B crying and his mum yelling at my dog and me. All sorts of accusations were hurled at me, including having a rabid dog, untrained dog and she said she was going to ensure my dog was put down. \n\nI tried to ask the other kids (my son and his friends) what happened. So, it turns out that B and his mother came up on their own and while my dog was lying in one corner, he decided to go over and start pulling his tail, even though the other kids told him not to. His mother waved them off and allowed B to continue. That resulted in my dog getting up, and barking at them as well as growling. I checked B for any injuries and found none. My CCTV recording showed exactly what my son and his friends had described and there was no contact between my dog and the boy at any point. \n\nB's mum brought him to the doctor anyway for a full checkup (no injuries found) and wanted me to compensate for that along with apologizing for the incident. I said no, and she would be lucky if I didn't pursue anything about trespassing into my house's upper floors.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1668997957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0mz8f/aita_for_not_apologizing_for_my_dog_scaring_off/", "score": 2864, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For some odd reason, some people consider themselves to be dog whisperers, yet want to blame the owner when the dog reacts exactly as the owner said it would, and dog breeds with aggressive reputations often are immediately blamed for any incident even if the human acted in a way they were explicitly told not to.

Long story short, when he tried to pet her when she was guarding her puppies, she bit him on the face. He needed stitches, but admitted it was entirely his fault for harassing a nursing mother dog when warned over and over not to go in the room where she and her babies were.

They could have just kept all the kids away from the dog and do party activities that include everyone. \n\nThen, the kids who know how to treat a dog properly could have always come back another day. \n\nI find it weird that so many people seem to be ok with treating kids differently at a party and then wonder when things go south.", "I have two Am Staffs (think small mastiff/large pitbull). My husbands a-hole friend brought his son over and he (the father) starts rough housing with one of them. I repeatedly told them to stop. Dad says, (as my dog is growling and TRYING to leave) \u201cI\u2019m not worried!! Right George! (His kid)\u201d.  I looked over saw my dog\u2019s body language, jumped and caught him before he barked at the kid that kept slapping his face. I told them to gtfo of my house. I told him I didn\u2019t particularly care if my dog bit HIM, but he could seriously hurt the child. He called me all kinds of names. My husband just told him he wasn\u2019t welcome back until he taught himself and his kid how to act around big dogs. PS my dogs have NEVER growled or barked at another kid. Before or after. NTA!!!!", "NTA -  This lady and her son got off easy for not obeying the rules. They are the AH.", "ESH - they should not have went up after you explicitly told them not to, but you put the dog away for a reason. It is asking for trouble to allow some guests (plus the birthday boy) dog visitation if it wasn't safe for the entire party. But that by no means makes you responsible for a checkup or compensation. \n\nI would not be inviting them over again...", "ESH.  Obviously the woman is an AH. But, OP, so are you for allowing **some** kids to leave the party to play with the dog, but not others.  Letting several kids show off that they are allowed to play and not others is mean.  Sure, maybe these kids weren\u2019t meaning to show off, but the other kids would certainly see the privilege that way. \n\nWhatever made you think other kids wouldn\u2019t try to sneak up and follow the 3 dog safe kids??????  It\u2019s like you forgot what kids are like\u2026never mind AH parents!", "NTA, and I hope they enjoyed their last invitation to your house.", "NTA, she overstepped, but next time don't let any of the boys go up. Set a rule and stick to it.", "NTA, you took all measures to ensure your dog wasn't upset by strangers in your home and it's not your fault that an AH parent went upstairs to your dog and allowed her child pull your dog's tale and ignored the figs warnings as a dog will warn. That ah parent should be glad you are a good dog owner and your dog is well trained as another dog could have bitten a child that pulls their tale. I as most people don't like been touched by strangers, children often  cry when been touched by strangers so why do people think dogs shouldn't mind been touched and abused (that's what tail pulling is) by strangers ?", "NTA. B\u2019s mom is an idiot. First off, you told her not to go upstairs and she did anyway which is just rude and inappropriate. Secondly, she was specifically told not to touch the dog as it\u2019s not the best with randos, she chose to let her kid pull the dogs tail. Also rude and inappropriate and honestly just straight stupid. It\u2019s not ok to do that to ANY dog but she chose to do it to a MASTIFF that could potentially bite half her kids face off if it wanted to. \n\nAlthough I do agree with what a lot of people already said, you really shouldn\u2019t have let ANY of the kids at the party go near the dog. Even your son. Of course kids that age are going to want to go see the dog (who doesn\u2019t wanna see a cute dog) especially when some of the kids are already doing it. Maybe next time you need to enforce that with your son. Not just for the safety of the kids but mostly for the safety of your dog. I hate to say it but there are a lot of breedist people out there, if anything was to happen your dog is screwed.", "NYA-Wow what a terrible mom. Did she want her kid to get bit?", "I was referring specifically to my Staffordshire Terrier bulldogs (not pits, but pretty much the same).  I\u2019ve also owned two Bull Mastiffs, and currently have a Rottweiler.  I\u2019ve never owned an aggressive dog, but as they got older two of my bullies weren\u2019t enthused with making new friends or being touched by people who were strangers - just growls, no snapping. And my Bull Mastiffs were the most amazing, loyal,lap dog wannabes. But, given the bad rep of the bulldog breed (actually bad rep of any guard dog breed) I\u2019ve always been ultra careful because I know that the circumstances don\u2019t matter - my dogs would always be immediately judged as being in the wrong if something ever happened. They count on me to keep the safe and navigate them through this crazy human world.", "B's mom actually intentionally put her son into a dangerous situation.  I doubt child services would look into it but it could have turned out so much worse and the mom would be at fault.  When I was a kid I thought all dogs were nice and it only took putting my hand out too fast once and \"almost\" getting bitten to realize I was wrong.  I got a talking to about dogs you don't know and not touching them.\n\nOP is NTA.", "By\u2026..having a party for his child at his house?", "lol do not get so upset over a random's person reply on the Internet.\n\nRead my post again carefully. Ask yourself the question: Would you allow your dog to hurt or potentially kill a kid, just because you told their mother, who does not listen, \"no\"?", "That sounds extremely irritating! I'm glad my mixed boy looks like a lab. Most of the time...\n\nHe's reactive, so walks are... fun... if I didn't look the way I do (big dude, brown skin, dreadlocks), I can only imagine having to deal with people trying to pet him. Worst I get is people looking from afar!", "No, I would not \"allow\" it, I would do exactly what OP did and tell them to leave the dog alone. If they won't, I'd tell them to leave my house because they can't be trusted to respect my space and rules. OP did due diligence warning and putting the dog away, what else, exactly, should they have done?  I'm sure you'd rather the dog be put down for just existing.", "Be me: 5'2\" white blonde female walking my reactive pit chow\n\nI will say his reactivity is/was (he's 9, things are much better these days!) Insecurity based so him looking like a rabid bear kept people away which is what he prefers anyway! Check out my posts to see him, he really is beautiful...but looks menacing with his hackles up!", ">Be me: 5'2\" white blonde female walking my reactive pit chow\n\nLmao so your every experience is likely the opposite of mine, for better or worse.\n\nEta, holy shit is he adorable! But yeah, he would be terrifying when he's scared, no doubt. Especially next to you! \n\nBy that I mean, you're not a large woman and I could see assuming (incorrectly, I have no doubt!) that you can't control him. People just be judgy like that.  \n\nI'd be very interested to see how your experiences differ from that of your partner... assuming you have one and that they're at least male presenting. Just to see how people react differently.", "NTA. Her and her Son\u2019s entitlement to disregard your rules caused the whole situation. \n\nPeople like this is why people don\u2019t like to entertain.", "OR the birthday boy could have been a bit overwhelmed and needed a small break and going upstairs to visit his dog with a couple of close friends who know him and the dog well was a good opportunity for that.   I don't know.  But neither do you."]}
