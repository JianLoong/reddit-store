I know people always love to exaggerate and say their dog is so loving regardless of whatever their dog's true personality is. My dog is friendly towards my family and people he's familiar with. But he's very aloof towards strangers. He doesn't bark towards strangers but will have a low growl if he's patted/touched without the proper introduction.\n\nSo anyway for the party, I decided the best solution was to have him kept upstairs on the 2nd/3rd floor, with a dog gate installed at the stairs. The party will be confined to the first floor and the garden. \n\nHalfway during the party, my son and his 2 friends wanted to go upstairs to see my dog. These 2 friends have come over to my house frequently and 3 of them have spent unsupervised time around my dog without any incidents for the past 2 years. They are very aware of the rules and boundaries I've set. They can go play fetch and stuff with him but they are never to play with his tail or face or try to sit on him. \n\nAnother boy (let's call him B) and his mum apparently heard that my dog was upstairs and wanted to head up too. I said nope, sorry, my dog doesn't play too well with people he doesn't know and I can't be around upstairs all the time. B's mum insisted that it will be fine and her son loves playing with dogs etc. I cut her off and said nah, another time, and directed them both towards the other toys/party stuff going on. \n\nLess than 5 minutes later, I hear some barking and some screaming from upstairs. I run up to see B crying and his mum yelling at my dog and me. All sorts of accusations were hurled at me, including having a rabid dog, untrained dog and she said she was going to ensure my dog was put down. \n\nI tried to ask the other kids (my son and his friends) what happened. So, it turns out that B and his mother came up on their own and while my dog was lying in one corner, he decided to go over and start pulling his tail, even though the other kids told him not to. His mother waved them off and allowed B to continue. That resulted in my dog getting up, and barking at them as well as growling. I checked B for any injuries and found none. My CCTV recording showed exactly what my son and his friends had described and there was no contact between my dog and the boy at any point. \n\nB's mum brought him to the doctor anyway for a full checkup (no injuries found) and wanted me to compensate for that along with apologizing for the incident. I said no, and she would be lucky if I didn't pursue anything about trespassing into my house's upper floors.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1668997957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0mz8f/aita_for_not_apologizing_for_my_dog_scaring_off/", "score": 1426, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For some odd reason, some people consider themselves to be dog whisperers, yet want to blame the owner when the dog reacts exactly as the owner said it would, and dog breeds with aggressive reputations often are immediately blamed for any incident even if the human acted in a way they were explicitly told not to.

Long story short, when he tried to pet her when she was guarding her puppies, she bit him on the face. He needed stitches, but admitted it was entirely his fault for harassing a nursing mother dog when warned over and over not to go in the room where she and her babies were.

If a human wouldn't let her walk away, if they crowded her, held her, pulled her tail, and didn't listen to her signals (body language and growl) she could bite them to get away. Probably just a nip, like a dog would do to correct a puppy, but a parent like this entitled mother could then potentially have my dog put down. \nWhich is exactly why OP had her dog upstairs, to prevent a situation like this.

She was trying for a lawsuit! I guarantee it. Who is told to stay away from a dog that is not friendly to strangers, then not only goes up and does it, but allows her 8 year old to pull its tail. No dog on earth likes its tail being pulled! (It may tolerate from a baby, but it certainly does not like it) She encouraged the kid to essentially assault the dog. Then her overreaction of taking the kid to the doctor tells me she was HOPING he got injured so she could sue the pants off you. So curious how many times she has filed lawsuits", "NTA. This was not an unsupervised kid. Je went there with his mom which is clearly TA here. She acted entitled, and is clearly immature. Her son could have been injured because of her.

The child was not psychically harmed.", "Hey OP, animal control employee here! I am going to absolutely rule absolutely NTA here. You set appropriate boundaries, removed your dog from the situation, tried to meditate with the mother of the boy and adamantly told them your dog doesn't do well with strangers and they snuck (proper term) behind your back to do the exact thing you said the boy and the mother could not do. This would be less upsetting and stupid if the little boy was there alone but the mother, who is an adult, was up there knowing she was doing something to make your dog uncomfortable to provoke him. And not only that but her response is to make sure your dog is euthanized for her utter stupidity? Keep the video OP, and keep the mom and son out of your house. After making sure the son was okay and without incident ( like you did), I would have done the same thing and hit them with trespassing. Your dog deserves to be comfortable in his own house and if your guests cannot respect that, they can GTFO.\n\n I commend your pup on his bite inhibition and count the mother lucky that nothing happened because dogs have different levels of bite inhibition but if the body language of discomfort is not recognized or a dog is forced to endure an uncomfortable situation, the dog is going to do what any of us would when pushed into a situation like that. Either flee or fight. The mom is stupid, and this lesson is for her to learn the hard way that there could be severe consequences for disregarding a warning about an animal they have never met before and have no previous experience handling. I am glad you have cameras because the mom would have probably turned it around to make it seem like your dog was Kujo or something. Way to disarm her before she went there. \n\nYou were looking out for everyone's safety and she was looking out for the stubborn ass request of her son and to probably make him feel less excluded but the proper thing she could have done was to teach her son that no means no and that you ask for consent from the owner before approaching a pet. She failed miserably. \n\nHer entitlement and lack of respect for your warning is the cause of this easily avoidable issue. It's on her 1000% and I hope she learns this for the next animal her and her son come across. NTA.

My dog *hated* kids with a passion, except for me and my sister since we got her as a pup. \n\nWe told all the guests that without a doubt, she would bit kids if they got near her. She was away from guests and had a fence to keep away and chained for the event. Obviously the mom thought she knew better than the owners and it ended with her brat getting bitten. The mom was the one that got chewed on for being an idiot and ignoring warnings. You do not joke around with a dog that doesn't like you. \n\nThat mom is lucky that all she got was a warning bark.
