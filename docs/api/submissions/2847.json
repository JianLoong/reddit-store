I know people always love to exaggerate and say their dog is so loving regardless of whatever their dog's true personality is. My dog is friendly towards my family and people he's familiar with. But he's very aloof towards strangers. He doesn't bark towards strangers but will have a low growl if he's patted/touched without the proper introduction.\n\nSo anyway for the party, I decided the best solution was to have him kept upstairs on the 2nd/3rd floor, with a dog gate installed at the stairs. The party will be confined to the first floor and the garden. \n\nHalfway during the party, my son and his 2 friends wanted to go upstairs to see my dog. These 2 friends have come over to my house frequently and 3 of them have spent unsupervised time around my dog without any incidents for the past 2 years. They are very aware of the rules and boundaries I've set. They can go play fetch and stuff with him but they are never to play with his tail or face or try to sit on him. \n\nAnother boy (let's call him B) and his mum apparently heard that my dog was upstairs and wanted to head up too. I said nope, sorry, my dog doesn't play too well with people he doesn't know and I can't be around upstairs all the time. B's mum insisted that it will be fine and her son loves playing with dogs etc. I cut her off and said nah, another time, and directed them both towards the other toys/party stuff going on. \n\nLess than 5 minutes later, I hear some barking and some screaming from upstairs. I run up to see B crying and his mum yelling at my dog and me. All sorts of accusations were hurled at me, including having a rabid dog, untrained dog and she said she was going to ensure my dog was put down. \n\nI tried to ask the other kids (my son and his friends) what happened. So, it turns out that B and his mother came up on their own and while my dog was lying in one corner, he decided to go over and start pulling his tail, even though the other kids told him not to. His mother waved them off and allowed B to continue. That resulted in my dog getting up, and barking at them as well as growling. I checked B for any injuries and found none. My CCTV recording showed exactly what my son and his friends had described and there was no contact between my dog and the boy at any point. \n\nB's mum brought him to the doctor anyway for a full checkup (no injuries found) and wanted me to compensate for that along with apologizing for the incident. I said no, and she would be lucky if I didn't pursue anything about trespassing into my house's upper floors.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1668997957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0mz8f/aita_for_not_apologizing_for_my_dog_scaring_off/", "score": 2348, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For some odd reason, some people consider themselves to be dog whisperers, yet want to blame the owner when the dog reacts exactly as the owner said it would, and dog breeds with aggressive reputations often are immediately blamed for any incident even if the human acted in a way they were explicitly told not to.

Long story short, when he tried to pet her when she was guarding her puppies, she bit him on the face. He needed stitches, but admitted it was entirely his fault for harassing a nursing mother dog when warned over and over not to go in the room where she and her babies were. You told her to stay away and any sensible person would have heeded your instructions and not put her kids at risk. She is lucky that she and her kids weren\u2019t bitten after abusing the dog!

My boyfriend at the time got up and went over to him while he was in his bed and wouldn\u2019t leave him alone. I could tell my dog was getting on edge and I warned him to leave him alone, and he was surprised when he got barked at; even though I told him what would happen. We didn\u2019t last long after that. People who don\u2019t respect animals won\u2019t respect you either", "If the mother took B to the doctors after just being barked at by the dog I wouldn't be surprised if she'll go to a lawyer next.

Then it wouldn\u2019t have been an issue. \n\nBut the other mom definitely is worse.", "I agree, and also think it's a terrible idea to allow *any* children to be around this dog unsupervised. With your own kid who obviously lives with the dog it's a bit different, but certainly other people's kids should never be left unsupervised with your dog regardless of how many times they've met him. I would personally not allow this with any dog, even the soppiest and friendliest golden retriever, but it's even more important with a dog that a) you know can be slightly reactive and b) is a very big strong breed capable of doing a horrific amount of damage if something goes wrong. These are seven year old children, you can't guarantee that they're going to behave perfectly and interpret his body language properly. Dogs can and do kill children. It's absolutely not worth the risk.", "> Honestly, I think it's shitty you let them be around this dog without supervision\n\nWhat part of the OP sounds like he \"let\" anyone be around the dog?", "How the hell did OP \"allow it to happen\" when OP very explicitly said leave the dog alone and took steps to put the dog away from the rest of the party, out of the way? If I tell someone not to do something and they do it anyway, that is 110% on the person who fucked around and found out. Way to victim blame, I bet you tell women they \"asked for it\" too.", "> allowing a kid to get endangered\n\nDo you not know what the word \"allow\" means?", "It\u2019s a potential access point for burglars, why not?", "It was also rude of the birthday boy to ditch his guests to go visit a dog with only two friends and none of the other children were allowed to go.  Of course other kids would want to go see the dog.  B's mom was dumb and rude for not listening, but I would definitely hold my kid to 'hey, you can't leave the party to do something the other kids can't do, you need to stay with your guests\".  If a dog isn't suitable for lots of kids all the kids need to stay away for the day. The birthday boy leaving the party to visit his super special dog you aren't allowed to see is gonna sound crazy tempting to a bunch of kids.", "Agreed, it should. And, the Mom was definitely the AH for ignoring the OP\u2019s instructions. But, legally often it isn\u2019t. For instance - if you have a swimming pool in your yard, and some kid goes swimming and drowns while you aren\u2019t home (even if you\u2019ve told them they aren\u2019t allowed in your pool), you can still be held legally responsible if you don\u2019t have a fence around the pool with a gate that latches.

But mastiffs are guard dogs all the same", "They expressly said that they have previously let their son's close friends be around the dog unsupervised, and did the same at this party by allowing the son and the \"approved\" friends to go and see the dog. Apparently OP trusts these seven year old children to be around their dog unsupervised because they know not to touch his face or tail. \n\nI'm sorry but I find that to be wildly irresponsible. Even with the friendliest and sweetest dog I've ever had, I wouldn't have left her unsupervised around someone else's 7yos. With my reactive dog who has to be handled carefully like OP's dog, absolutely never in a million years. Children make mistakes and mastiffs are huge, strong and capable of inflicting horrific damage if something goes wrong.

As a full grown person you can take care of yourself, but this is not true for kids, the kid is the last to blame. Woman and her kid are two separate persons, not one, to make this more clear: OP was an AH towards the kid (and their dog). It is their dog and therefore their responsibility that it hurts noone.\n\nWould you allow a kid to play with someone's gun because their parents are ok with it and think it is unloaded (but you know it isn't)?

That's doesn't mean it's ok watch animal cruelty without doing anything. At least try to lift the kid of the dog and/or try to get the dog away from the kid.

And low and behold, the kids mom knew better.  Not only did she let her kid go 'play' with a dog they were warned about, they decided to just go upstairs when they were asked not to.

The video is on your side.", "NTA, OP!\n\n**Nobody of any age should pull a dog's tail, sit on them, or grab their face!** The dog will interpret all of those as threats or attacks and will give warning growls before physically defending itself. \n\nThe clueless kid and equally clueless mother brought this on themselves.
