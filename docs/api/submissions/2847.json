{"id": 2847, "submission_id": "z0mz8f", "title": "AITA for not apologizing for my dog scaring off another kid?", "selftext": "My 7 year old son was having a birthday party the previous weekend and a number of his friends and schoolmates around his age came over, along with their parents.\n\nI have a male mastiff-mix for context. I know people always love to exaggerate and say their dog is so loving regardless of whatever their dog's true personality is. My dog is friendly towards my family and people he's familiar with. But he's very aloof towards strangers. He doesn't bark towards strangers but will have a low growl if he's patted/touched without the proper introduction.\n\nSo anyway for the party, I decided the best solution was to have him kept upstairs on the 2nd/3rd floor, with a dog gate installed at the stairs. The party will be confined to the first floor and the garden. \n\nHalfway during the party, my son and his 2 friends wanted to go upstairs to see my dog. These 2 friends have come over to my house frequently and 3 of them have spent unsupervised time around my dog without any incidents for the past 2 years. They are very aware of the rules and boundaries I've set. They can go play fetch and stuff with him but they are never to play with his tail or face or try to sit on him. \n\nAnother boy (let's call him B) and his mum apparently heard that my dog was upstairs and wanted to head up too. I said nope, sorry, my dog doesn't play too well with people he doesn't know and I can't be around upstairs all the time. B's mum insisted that it will be fine and her son loves playing with dogs etc. I cut her off and said nah, another time, and directed them both towards the other toys/party stuff going on. \n\nLess than 5 minutes later, I hear some barking and some screaming from upstairs. I run up to see B crying and his mum yelling at my dog and me. All sorts of accusations were hurled at me, including having a rabid dog, untrained dog and she said she was going to ensure my dog was put down. \n\nI tried to ask the other kids (my son and his friends) what happened. So, it turns out that B and his mother came up on their own and while my dog was lying in one corner, he decided to go over and start pulling his tail, even though the other kids told him not to. His mother waved them off and allowed B to continue. That resulted in my dog getting up, and barking at them as well as growling. I checked B for any injuries and found none. My CCTV recording showed exactly what my son and his friends had described and there was no contact between my dog and the boy at any point. \n\nB's mum brought him to the doctor anyway for a full checkup (no injuries found) and wanted me to compensate for that along with apologizing for the incident. I said no, and she would be lucky if I didn't pursue anything about trespassing into my house's upper floors.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1668997957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0mz8f/aita_for_not_apologizing_for_my_dog_scaring_off/", "score": 162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That is so rude of them.", "NTA\nI am astounded everyday on how many people think they know a dog better than the owner and feel entitled to do as they please!\nYou clearly set a boundary, they thought they knew better, and clearly found out differently. Be grateful you have a camera proving their abuse to your dog, led to your dog's reaction. And very glad that no one was bit (despite deserving it).\nTo avoid future problems, it may be best to keep your dog off limits until all guests have left? It may help detour future issues of people not respecting your boundaries.\n*editing to add, seek a lawyer to make sure you have precautions in place, should this happen again. You could still be liable should your dog bite someone even if they deserved it.", "NTA. B and his mom fucked around and found out. They\u2019re lucky your dog is pretty chill. I know a lot of dogs who would\u2019ve been a lot less forgiving.", "B's mom learned a cheap lesson with her son just getting a growl and a scare. If her son doesn't learn from it, he may pull on the wrong tail and end up severely injured.\n\nNTA, but she's clueless.", "Definitely NTA! You set the boundary and warned them. They disregarded the boundary and disrespected you in your own home. Sorry you had to go through this!", "NTA\nB and his mother trespassed and pulled the tail of a large dog. For most dogs, that is a big no-no. Your dog told them off for the disrespect. B's mom should use this as a teaching moment: don't approach strange dogs, don't yank a dog's tail, and don't trespass.", "People who go out of their way to hurt animals deserve to be thrown out with a good swift kick in the ass. NTA.", "As a person who has owned numerous dogs of a breed with a bad reputation, I cannot suggest strongly enough that, in the future events, you ensure there\u2019s a physical barrier more effective than a dog gate. Such as a door that can be securely latched at the top of the door. For some odd reason, some people consider themselves to be dog whisperers, yet want to blame the owner when the dog reacts exactly as the owner said it would, and dog breeds with aggressive reputations often are immediately blamed for any incident even if the human acted in a way they were explicitly told not to. Hence the latch being at the top of the door - a person (adult) has to willfully ignore instructions in order to access said dog. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA.  Mom was the AH for trespassing in your home and ignoring your instructions regarding your dog. Would this have happened if your son and other kids had been kept away from your dog as well? Maybe, but less likely. Don\u2019t ever invite Mom back to your home - if she\u2019s so bold as to snoop in an area she was told to avoid, she\u2019ll disrespect your privacy and belongings in any way she sees fit.", "NTA\nDog incident or not, this woman was trespassing and has no leg to stand on. I probably would\u2019ve escorted her off the property immediately.", "NTA  She was extremely rude to go upstairs after you told her no, then her child assaulted your dog, you should send her a bill for your dog's emotional damages and see what she thinks of that.", "NTA. Some people are really stupid. At one point I had a rescue dog who has been abandoned on the street while pregnant and half starved. I took her in and after she had puppies my super came to my apartment to make repairs. I told him that my dog was extremely unfriendly and had puppies. He kept saying, \u201cdogs love me,\u201d and insisted on going to the room where my dog and her puppies were even though I told him repeatedly to leave her alone. Long story short, when he tried to pet her when she was guarding her puppies, she bit him on the face. He needed stitches, but admitted it was entirely his fault for harassing a nursing mother dog when warned over and over not to go in the room where she and her babies were. You told her to stay away and any sensible person would have heeded your instructions and not put her kids at risk. She is lucky that she and her kids weren\u2019t bitten after abusing the dog! Good thing you had the camera to show what really happened. In the future, you might consider locking the door of the room where your dog is when kids come over.\n\nEdit:typo", "NTA and you are not responsible since the woman was to blame.  If she tried to take you to court you would have to have people back you up saying the dog was not loose and people were told to stay away\n\nI realize your dog was probably extra upset because it was his house but hopefully he can get more socializing so isn\u2019t a risk", "ESH. Mostly B and his mother, but you should have told your son and his friends that they could not go upstairs during the party.  Letting some of the kids go up but then telling others they can't (for very legit reasons) was bound to lead to hard feelings.  Your son should have stayed downstairs at the party with his guests.", "Yeah YTA, not for not apologising, but for not securing your reactive dog during a kids party. Kids are stupid and unpredictable (unlike your amazing \"growls sometimes\" dog). There should have been a blanket rule that no one goes near the dog, and it should have been behind a closed door. Maybe keep it in mind for next time?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Lucky for the entitled mother and child, your dog merely growled at them. A dog that size is easily capable of killing both an adult and a child. That mother is a very bad parent as well as being an idiot.", "If the mom brings in a lawyer, you're in for a knotty legal problem. They'd say \"If the dog was unfriendly, and very large, why did you have children over with just a gate as protection? It wouldn't have stood up to the dog, and it clearly wasn't a match for a human. You were negligent.\" I'm not saying they'd be correct, but be prepared.\n\nThis is above reddit's pay grade.", "Even without the dog, it was incredibly rude for the mom and kid to go elsewhere in the house when being told No.", "I agree.  \n\nBut it\u2019s also rude to invite people over for a party then ditch them.", "Lol behave.", "This. Can\u2019t imagine having a pet that is higher maintenance than a child. Dog mauling of a human waiting to happen\u2026", "Yeah. For there to be a cognizable legal claim, there have to be some damages. No lawyer would take this based on the kid being scared.", "No lawyer would touch this - there was no harm done to anyone, so there\u2019s nothing to sue over.  If the kid had been injured, OP would be facing trouble, but he wasn\u2019t.", "Hmm I doubt there's anything to sue for this unless they want to go down the child trauma/psychiatrist route but thanks, that's something for me to think about.", "Ditch them? A host can\u2019t spend every second with every guest. That is not reasonable. He told them the parts of his house that was off limits, showed them to the fun stuff and they went where he told them not to go. That is absolutely not okay.", "Can you elaborate on the \"ditch them\" part?", "The kid would have to have SEVERE symptoms for them to have a legal claim for psychological trauma without physical trauma.  It\u2019d have to be truly life altering.\n\nHaving said that, if he HAD been injured, you would be liable, so you definitely want to be much firmer about preventing future possible incidents.  A big dog like that can do a lot of accidental harm trying to get away from something upsetting them.  I have a 50lb boxer mix who is afraid of kids and who has snapped once at a kid, so we are very careful to not let small kids around her at all and closely supervise with older kids.", "I think they're talking about the fact that the son ditched his friends at his own birthday party.

I had a cute Boston Terrier who didn't like strangers. I had to basically be very adamant with people approaching my dog with intentions of petting him. It usually took him growling and barking to make them stop.", "NTA. sounds like this woman set out to prove something. block her and don\u2019t ever let her back in your home.", "NTA.

She had the dog gated away from folks at a dinner party. One of the women wanted to \"meet\" the dog, friend said no, repeatedly. Dog didn't like new folks. Woman went through doors, around 2 couches, stepped over gates - and the dog bit her hand firmly and wouldn't let go. The woman screamed and friend was like \"What the Heck are you doing in there after I told you to leave her alone?\" Dog eventually let go, and there wasn't any real damage except to the stupid visitor's ego, because she loved dogs and didn't get the love back...\n\nStupid woman sued, but the court didn't give her any money. There were lots of witness statements that said stupid is as stupid does ;)", "100% agree\n\nWhen you have a bunch of 7 year olds around rules really, really need to be consistent whenever possible. There was no need for any kids to see the dog in that moment. Your kid lives with the dog and the other kids apparently have enough chances to see the dog so why create an unequal situation when you could have just as easily taught your kid that sometimes you don't do something out of kindness because not everyone can do that thing. \n\nIt's okay to be kind instead of being right and that's a position this sub can't seem to get in board with.", "You're getting downvoted but you're right.\n\nI'm a teacher. If you're trying to control a group of children, that goes out the window when the rules aren't consistent. The mother shouldn't have let it get that far but also you can't let some kids do something in front of others, and expect them not to want to do the same."]}
