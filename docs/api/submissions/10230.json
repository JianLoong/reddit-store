Most of the time I am away from home. I own a condo unit.\n\nMay 2022 sister showed up at our building's lobby unannounced with her things. She told me that she will be staying there until further notice since I am leaving in a few weeks. I told her that since she is gonna be staying at my place I wanna know what happened. She told me F\\*\\*k you and went unpacking.\n\nIt was only when I was overseas when she told me that she cheated on her BF with a guy she met. I saw the new guy and immediately did not like him.\n\nDuring her stay from May to December, she has done a number of things which pissed me off. It started with her inviting friends over and trashing the place (Partying and posting it on Tiktok). \n\nMother decided to visit and almost fainted. To say the place was a wasteland, was an understatement. My mother immediately started cleaning (Bathroom's tiles were originally white but are now yellow, Water damage, broken chair, piles of dishes). Mom went out to shop, then when she returned, the guy she slept with is in my condo, playing on my PC. I flipped out and was on the verge of kicking her out had my fam asked me not to. Also found out I am 2 months behind my association dues.\n\nDecember, she apologized and I thought that was that. \n\nJanuary came and I asked her if she can shoulder the bathroom furnishing since it costs around 200$. She said she doesn't have money.\n\nI told her you lived 7 months rent free paying only your utilities, bought Jordans, travelled a lot, and you can't even do this?\n\nShe told me to shut up and that if I had a problem with her, then I should've kicked her out months ago. She told me don't worry she will be moving at the end of January. I told her get the f out now.\n\nMy friend came, got my keys, took pics and vids, and told me that it's a massacre.\n\nMy family has been bombarding me with texts telling me I am a heartless person and that I should've not kicked her out since she is family and give her time to learn her lesson. To forgive her because if God can forgive, why can't I?\n\nI told them unless God's gonna pay all the overdue bills and repairs, then maybe I can forgive her. Until then, I guess I'll see you guys in hell.\n\nNow she is staying at another Uncle's house since apparently she \"doesn't have money for her own place\" and she \"cannot live alone\". I just laughed and told my family that until you stop coddling and tolerating her actions and start teaching her to own up and be an actual adult, she will not live past 40 years old.\n\nINFO:\n\nSis is a Software Engineer earning around 5 figures a month.\n\nNot once has she contributed towards my mortgage or made any renovations / furnishing.\n\nShe left a ton of damages to my unit which cost me a couple of thousands of dollars to repair.\n\nShe always had this attitude of whenever you call her out, she starts being defensive.", "created_utc": 1676663759, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114vxxj/aita_for_kicking_my_sister_out_of_my_place_for/", "score": 382, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
