We have a daughter (6) and have been together for 12 years. Liv is my 2nd wife. I married my first wife, Anna (57F) when I was 21. Anna is French, and we met when I was in France for a holiday. We have 2 children, Sofia (30F) and Matteo (27M). Anna and I were married for 8 years and had an amicable divorce, and I am on good terms with both of my children and Anna, and I see them often.\n\nI then moved to the US, where I met Abby (48F). We were together for 5 years (not married) with 2 children, Jake (20M) and Leah (16F). I cheated on Abby with Harper (35F) and had a daughter, Maddie (15F).  Harper and I stayed together for 2 years but we eventually amicably split up. I  moved back to Europe so I bought them a house as well as providing financial support. I see Maddie in person twice a year and we talk every day.\n\nMy split with Abby was messy. Abby told me she didn\u2019t want me in our children\u2019s lives, and I didn\u2019t fight her very hard on it. I keep in touch with both of them, and Abby and I came to an agreement where I don't  pay child support, but I instead pay for school. I agreed. I also give them both a generous allowance and expensive gifts for b-days and X-mas. I'm aware it\u2019s a poor substitute for a father.\n\nAfter we split, Abby married Cole(51M) and had Ryan (12M). From what I\u2019ve heard from my kids, Ryan is the golden child of the house. They aren\u2019t mistreated by any means, and from what I can tell, they like their stepfather well enough, but if there is an argument between Ryan and either one of my kids, Abby & Cole will take Ryan's side.\n\nAbby's always been a reckless spender. Now Abby and Cole are struggling financially, and she has asked my kids to chip in. I have more than enough money so I had no problem upping Jake & Leah's allowances so they can help their family and keep some for themselves.\n\nAbby called me up out of the blue a few weeks ago, and this is where I might be the AH.\n\nShe fought with Jake when he refused to use his allowance to help pay their mortgage. I told her that since Jake is no longer living with her, he has no obligation to pay for HER house.\n\nShe then demanded that I give Ryan an allowance as well as Jake and Leah. She told me that I wasn\u2019t allowed to financially support Jake & Leah without also including Ryan because he was feeling left out. I told her to F off and that I\u2019m not going to stop supporting my kids just because she can't support her own.\n\nI told her that I'll still pay Leah's tuition but I\u2019m stopping her allowance so Abby doesn\u2019t get any money.\n\nBoth of Abby\u2019s parents called me to say I'm an AH for not stepping up and helping my kids, and Cole also called to scream at me.\n\nI had to block their numbers.\n\nMy family reassured me that I'm not the AH, but I'm not sure because I feel guilty that Leah's the one who suffers.\n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr: My ex is asking me to financially support her kid", "created_utc": 1702756901, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18jzatd/aita_for_refusing_to_financially_support_my_baby/", "score": 2407, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We have a daughter (6) and have been together for 12 years. Liv is my 2nd wife. I married my first wife, Anna (57F) when I was 21. Anna is French, and we met when I was in France for a holiday. We have 2 children, Sofia (30F) and Matteo (27M). Anna and I were married for 8 years and had an amicable divorce, and I am on good terms with both of my children and Anna, and I see them often.\r  \n\r  \nI then moved to the US, where I met Abby (48F). We were together for 5 years (not married) with 2 children, Jake (20M) and Leah (16F). I cheated on Abby with Harper (35F) and had a daughter, Maddie (15F).  Harper and I stayed together for 2 years but we eventually amicably split up.\r I  moved back to Europe so I bought them a house as well as providing financial support. I see Maddie in person twice a year and we talk every day.\r  \n\r  \nMy split with Abby was messy. Abby told me she didn\u2019t want me in our children\u2019s lives, and I didn\u2019t fight her very hard on it. I keep in touch with both of them, and Abby and I came to an agreement where I don't  pay child support, but I instead pay for school. I agreed. I also give them both a generous allowance and expensive gifts for b-days and X-mas. I'm aware it\u2019s a poor substitute for a father. \r  \n\r  \nAfter we split, Abby married Cole(51M) and had Ryan (12M). From what I\u2019ve heard from my kids, Ryan is the golden child of the house. They aren\u2019t mistreated by any means, and from what I can tell, they like their stepfather well enough, but if there is an argument between Ryan and either one of my kids, Abby & Cole will take Ryan's side.\r  \n\r  \nAbby's always been a reckless spender. Now Abby and Cole are struggling financially, and she has asked my kids to chip in. I have more than enough money so I had no problem upping Jake & Leah's allowances so they can help their family and keep some for themselves.\r  \n\r  \nAbby called me up out of the blue a few weeks ago, and this is where I might be the AH.\r  \n\r  \nShe fought with Jake when he refused to use his allowance to help pay their mortgage. I told her that since Jake is no longer living with her, he has no obligation to pay for HER house. \n\nShe then demanded that I give Ryan an allowance as well as Jake and Leah.

There's private schools - even in New York or Boston - where tuition is as little as $2000 or $3000 for secondary school; while there's no reason to assume it's the low end, the national average expense is *still* only around $12k -- not an insignificant expense, obviously, but when we're talking about his implied income being enough to support up to four households at one point, across two continents (when he married the newest wife, Matteo from his first marriage was \\~15, Leah from his second relationship was 4, and Maddie fromt he affair was 3...)... it's fairly likely to be *significantly* less than a court calculated formula would've had him on the hook for.\n\nAlso note that while he specifies he's agreed to pay Maddie's post-secondary education (you know, the daughter he had while cheating on Abby with a teenager, when he already had a teenage daughter himself...), he doesn't actually specify *that* for the two kids with Abby. So what we have here is a 'father' who covers one major expense for his kids each year, leaves the ex on the hook for housing + groceries + clothes + American health insurance (this alone may be a bigger yearly expense than private school tuition) + all incidentals, he gives the kids a \"generous\" allowance that can't even offset one of those bills, and then occasional gifts on birthdays and holidays.\n\nAbby was probably short-sighted when she agreed to this 'deal,' because it was likely only a deal for him.

Besides, even if she *was* hanging out on campus *with her brother*, to suggest she's automatically going to be raped and no one will do anything about it is just.... reaching beyond belief!\n\nUS college campuses definitely have their problems, including poor handling of sexual assault complaints, but to suggest a teenager who is of the age to actually attend college classes is going to be raped just by hanging at the school with her brother, who is 4 years older than her, is a tad outrageous. \n\nBe annoyed at OP, by all means!

But yeah, if she's hanging out with 20-year-old men and doesn't have parents who love her enough to look out for her and it's the US of A, trust me, I know that age group through my work, and she's not as safe as she would be with involved parents and a safe house to go home to.", "Yep, okay. You and I have different risk assessment metrics, and you also missed my use of that little word \"if.\"  That is not an assumption, it's a hypothesis.  I've taught, mentored, and counseled thousands of young men and women in that age bracket and I did not assume that she would be raped or become pregnant. (or contract an incurable STD, left that one out) I just thought like a responsible parent about a teenager who has an unstable and abusive home life, and an absent biodad.  \n\nI grew up among those sorts of families where money is supposed to compensate for love, and saw the girls come to all kinds of harm, so yes, I'm cautious and concerned for Leah's safety.  Once OP was done bragging about his sperm count and the other children he sired, who are not at all relevant to Leah's situation, which is all this boils down to in the end, we got scant data about Leah other than that she has to go to Jake's, half an hour away and back again, for company.  Can she get there and back without money for gas or public transport? That's one question.  \n\nAlso, unless Jake has absolutely no friends in the town were he grew up and went to school, then it's likely he has friends his age and older, and new acquaintances at his new school he doesn't know so well.  Some or all of them might hang out at the apartment or go out when they're socializing and take Leah along with them to things off or on campus so yes, there are risks to underage kids in those situations.  Neither you nor I know enough about Leah's situation to assess the risks or her ability to assess them or make her own decisions about them when she apparently has a mom and stepdad who don't give a damn about her, and a biodad who in his concern for her mostly talks about his own past schtumping whatever he could grab.  \n\nIt also sounds as though the mom and stepdad have been treating her like dog crap on the bottom of their shoes, so she's probably not full of self-esteem, which can make a young girl vulnerable.  And if she's spending so much time at Jake's, does she have friends at secondary school who support her, or is she isolated there, too?  My instinct is to protect the vulnerable by assessing the risks, so, that's the point of my if-then statement that is targeted to an old man who doesn't seem to assess the risks to the people he brings into the world.  If you and I were talking face to face, we'd likely be having an entirely different conversation.  But it's the InterWebZ, so...", "Exactly.

He says Leah's the only one he *does* \"struggle\" to see, references once weekly phone calls at a point (blaming his ex for that, like the onus wasn't on him to go to the courts if he was actually interested in a relationship with his kid...), and meanwhile seems to think he's *not* struggling to see Maddie, who he consistently characterizes as seeing \"twice a year.\"\n\nYou do understand family court is a thing, right? He didn't try. He's still not trying. He's using the convenient excuse of \"but Abby doesn't want me to!\" but think about *why.* He hasn't bothered to show up for these kids or attempted to actually be a physical presence in their life since Leah was, at most, 3, but more likely since shortly after she was born (he says he was with Abby for 5 years, and the four years between his two kids with her + the time she spent pregnant with the older one brings you to almost those 5 years by the time Leah's born... the 3 comes from 'staying' with Harper from two years and a generous view of this starting after Maddie's born... then he moves back to Europe after those 2 years. So at most Leah's 3).\n\nBreaking this down Barney-style for you: he cheats on Abby with a 19 year old, who he impregnates and leaves her for. When his relationship with Harper doesn't work out, he buys Harper a house, promises Harper a personal income she's still collecting over a decade later, and promises to pay for Maddie's private school and university tuition. For his two kids with Abby, he \"doesn't really fight\" to see them, settling for weekly phone calls *without* advocating for his rights in court, and only offers to pay for \"school\" (not specifying that includes post-secondary like with Abby), an \"allowance,\" and occasional \"expensive gifts\" (which he later characterizes as clothes and electronics, which are really m ore like necessities for kids...) \n\nBasically, he made it super clear to Abby he didn't care enough about their kids to fight for access to them. It doesn't make her toxic to take him at his word with that, and protect their hearts and minds.\n\nNow Abby's struggling to pay her mortgage so reaches out to him. Her request he spend money on her other kid is ridiculous, sure. But her request for money really *isn't.* She's just not very smart and really should be dragging his ass to court, because he'd almost surely owe her more in child support than he's contributed.", "Is it in the US?

I think it has to do with making sure that she\u2019s incredibly well educated and that her brother is looking out for her. \nMy sister didn\u2019t have to look out for me but I was very very mature for my age precisely because my parents did not pay attention and I learned early that I had to look out for myself.

I'm not assuming she's going to end up pregnant or that she's living in a U.S. state where she'll be convicted for seeking an abortion, or assuming that she'll be raped or end up with an incurable STD, but I do think it's a parent's job to reduce the chances of that happening by providing as safe an environment as they can.", "Exactly that last point.
