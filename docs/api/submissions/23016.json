You could have thought it out a bit more as it didn\u2019t need to become a competition which will cause arguments. A game is fine and fun but yea I see where your wife is coming from all you had to do was try get them to cook and you did it masterfully but then chose to make it a competition, the problem here is not the game but the competition, I can already see it now \u201cno I don\u2019t want that it\u2019s not fair I never win\u201d could be a good lesson you don\u2019t always get what you want in life but idk if it\u2019s worth it, I think that\u2019s what your wife thought.

Heck, make it in to a competition and expand on what you do. \nI\u2019d check out SortedFood for some ideas. \nYou could do a competition where 3/4 people cook and the person not cooking has to guess who made what dish. Or do a parents vs kid and child/parent team ones, you could do mystery baskets, so many options. Now that they seem to have the basics down, I\u2019d push them to expand their knowledge and be a bit more independent. \n\nYour wife could (rightly) have concerns that this will turn the kids against each other and doesn\u2019t realize yet that they actually enjoy it.", "NTA.

This seems really brilliant. As long as one of them doesn't always win and they are kind to each other this is great.\n\nMaybe you could also team them up together for certain Meals, so say you and your wife as a team making a starter or sides and they make a main course as a pair and you can each vote or score. That way they're not always pitted against each other. Being better than mum and dad at something is often a big motivator especially if they have a reasonable chance of winning too.", "NTA but I can kind of understand where she's coming from, and I have a suggestion, though I don't really know if it's a good one.\n\nInclude yourself in the competition, with a handicap so that you are pretty much guaranteed to lose. Of course you have a handicap because you've been cooking for years.

Ofcourse it will keep causing problems if only one person keeps on winning, afterall not everyone is a good cook.", "This is the type of thing kids will remember forever - in a good way. And they\u2019ll be way more conscious of cooking skills than a lot of adults. My friends and I used to have contests like this with each other but it was mostly about who could could the best scrambled eggs, pancakes, or Kraft dinner. We would have one of our siblings do a blind taste test. It was SO much fun.\n\nThis is honestly next level, unbelievably good parenting.

If anything I think that\u2019s probably where the problem lies for her. I can see why she could feel some resentment for being left out. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough to warrant stopping what you and the kids are doing though. At least not in the immediate future, as long as you try to bring her into the game and don\u2019t deliberately excluded her.\n\nNTA atm, but work on including her or else you could stray into AH territory if she is never allowed/able to be part of it too.", "Ohhh cake!", "A lark!
