They begged and pleaded for us to find a sitter, but we declined.\n\nSoon after all the parents of the children in the wedding party followed suit. The were in danger of losing nearly their entire wedding party (most of the party were parents of the children in question) for the reception. They very quickly changed their minds and allowed the children in the wedding party to attend the reception. \n\nWhile I don't expect your situation to play out like this, you should stand your ground.

Then my daughter and son were dressed in the flower girl dress and the suit and minutes before the wedding she stated that if there was even a remote chance my kids were going to cry going down the aisle that they should not be included. My oldest son was 3 at the time and Autistic and my 2 year old daughter was kept from her nap to attend hair and make up. My son spent weeks in therapy practicing waking down the aisle. But never got to do it because he looked like he might make a scene. And no nap for a 2 year old obviously resulted in the same. SO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR KID.

You committed to having your daughter playing this role while she was with you throughout the day.

If she's a good friend she'll understand.", "Same! My flower girl and ring bearer were the only children at my reception. \n\nWhat are people supposed to do with their kids after the ceremony? Dose them with Benadryl and lock them in a room?", "This!", "This!!!", "Flower girls are props, tho. They are pretty to have but not necessary. A flower girl is for show.", "Or an employee. She's been given a job and hours of work for nothing. NTA", "Wow! I was flower girl and got a doll whose dress matched mine since auntie mDe them both. Ring bearer got a fire truck", "Before I got married, I went to a few weddings where kids were wandering up and down the aisle during the ceremony. At one, kids were crying and screaming so loud you couldn\u2019t hear the bride and groom exchange vows. A lot of receptions don\u2019t even start until past a lot of kids bedtimes, so you\u2019re keeping them up late resulting in meltdowns and tantrums. That\u2019s why I decided to have a child free wedding (that and it would have easily added another 30 guests when we already wanted to keep it small). Yes, kids need to learn how to behave in public but someone\u2019s wedding isn\u2019t the venue to teach them. If you want to have kids at your wedding, go wild, but there are legitimate reasons to have child free weddings. \n\nHaving said that, OP\u2019s friend is an A H for wanting her daughter to be a flower girl but not including her in the reception. This is an obvious exception that needs to be made if you\u2019re going to have a child-free wedding.", "The problem is how many people don\u2019t teach their kids proper manners and enforce them at home.  That\u2019s where kids \u201cpractice\u201d until they are reliable enough for going out.", "No, I disagree pretty strongly on all of this. \n\n> How are people gonna complain that kids don't know how to behave in a restaurant or reception, if you don't allow them in?\n\nLots of people that never attended weddings as children know how to behave at receptions and restaurants as teenagers and adults because they grow, develop, and mature as people. \n\n> And what do kids do that is so bad at a wedding? Yell, play, laugh, make a mess? \n\nYes, a lot of people don't want that at their wedding. \n\n> Same thing all kids do and everyone else is doing?\n\nA lot of people don't have people yelling, playing, and making messes at their weddings. Many find that preferable. Additionally, open alcohol around children is a major no-go not just for wedding hosts, but also for venues. Some make you choose between under-18 guests and what kind of bar you're allowed to have. The drinking age isn't 18, but if the guest is over 18 and under 21, then they're their own problem \u2013 not yours \u2013 on their insurance policy.", "It\u2019s for girls who are important or close to the bride but are too young to be bridesmaids (ie prepubescent).", "Dancing food\u2026.. plenty of fun things for kids. Never been to a wedding where children weren\u2019t dancing around and having a blast", "NTA..\n\nI don't get this stupid child free weddings anyway", "NTA, your call, but I think you hugely overestimate how much fun a 4-5 year old is going to have at a wedding reception.", "NTA. She is using your daughter as a prop for aesthetics and a photo op.  Your daughter might as well be a doll.  Of course she should be fed.  Pull her out.", "my older sister did this while I was still 16 (she then changed it to 16+) and our little sister was only 8 and it caused a shit tonne of drama between us, so no, I don't blame you for wanting to pull her out, NTA", "NTA. This woman is beyond ridiculous. If she wants a child free wedding, she should have the gumption to go fully child free. She cant use others kids like this.", "NTA, if it doesn't work for you it doesn't work for you.\n\nThat said, this isn't uncommon. Even at weddings that aren't childfree, it's not uncommon in my experience to have someone pick up small children after the ceremony.

She wants to use your daughter as a prop. Not cool.", "Your four-year-old will surely be bored by about 99% of what goes on during these events. They're very picturesque, and oh yes it's an \"honor\"---but you're not going to enjoy the rest of the day yourself if you have to entertain her for the rest of the event (or find her a place to sleep underneath your table).  Your little girl isn't likely to have a memory of doing it, either, without prompting from you.\n\nHonestly, your best bet for having an enjoyable time at your friend's wedding is to leave your child at home, forget about all the flower girl claptrap (which you'd be paying for, right?), and have a good grownup time.\n\nPS: I'd forgotten all about this when I wrote the paragraphs above but I have been at two weddings, where the adorable flower girls broke down, cried, left the bridal group to wander around, etc etc. Not all four-year-olds are Shirley Temple waiting to be discovered. My own adorable four-year-old daughter came with us to a wedding and spent most of the day sleeping, yes, under various tables.", "I was a flower girl at 4 years old for my Aunt. And yes. I was invited to all events. And yes I behaved well, and still remember it fondly to this day 60 odd years later.\n\nYour 'friend' is asking your daughter to do her a favour and perform as flower girl at rehearsal and wedding, but not even rewarding her for that effort with the basic respect of inviting her to enjoy the events she's performing in. In other words, treating her as an inanimate object without feelings to be used and discarded at will.\n\nYou are NTA OP. \nIt's a disrespectful AH request from the bride.\nIf she wants your daughter to get a flower girl she should invite her to the events or do without.", "Screw that, NTA", "NTA. My best friend got married in Dec 2020. It was a child free wedding with the exceptions of the 2 flower girls (one was my daughter, 7 at the time & another girl 1 at the time) & the ring bearer, 8 at the time. All 3 stayed for the reception. It\u2019s wildly unfair for her to use your daughter as a prop for pictures.", "NTA is just rude and I\u2019m assuming bride doesn\u2019t have children and doesn\u2019t have the common sense to get why this isn\u2019t ok", "NTA, although I will say that my kids participated in a wedding like this, and the compromise was that my in-laws were invited to the wedding and participated in the photos before the reception, and then they took my kids to their place for a sleepover. The kids would not have enjoyed the reception, but I didn't have any transportation/ babysitting stress either.", "Idk why people do child free weddings unless it\u2019s a money thing. There are adults drinking ? That\u2019s apart of literal life. Drinking in celebration for a momentous occasion is wonderful and kids get to see adults be so silly. \n\n\nAnyway.\n\nNTA. Really sucks for your kid, I don\u2019t blame you at all.", "Why don't you leave with your daughter as well instead of going to the reception?\n Bridezilla alert!", "NTA. She should have been up front and clear about her expectations BEFORE she asked you to have your 4 year old be a part of her ceremony. It isn't fair to ask a small child to go through all that for no pay off. It's her choice to have a child free wedding, that's fine, but then she shouldn't have flower girls or a ring bearer. She should only have adults present. This isn't fair to your daughter. Weddings are a lot on kids. The fun afterwards is what makes it all worth it. She's YOUR daughter and this decision is yours alone.", "I think people have this idea of a perfect event in their head and are worried that a crying child is going ruin it. I think what they don\u2019t realize is that for the couple getting married, the day is mostly a blur anyway and the most memorable moments are usually not the perfectly planned ones but the small unplanned moments and imperfections.", "But it obviously doesn't sound like a great plan to OP, or she wouldn't be considering pulling her daughter from the wedding. It's not unreasonable for the bride to not want the kids there, but it's also not unreasonable for OP to decide she's not okay with doing the extra work. \n\nWhat is unreasonable is the bride getting upset, when she should have been upfront with not wanting kids at the rehearsal dinner/reception in the first place. She didn't give OP all the necessary information, that's on her.", "Yeah, and lmao at the comment OP already committed. You can't just hide part of the logistics information and then complain people make different choices with different information.", "It was their parents' wedding! Of course they were interested!", "There's not really a purpose... it's just a fun task and an easy way to include a child or children that you care about. A lot of kids enjoy the role - I wasn't even going to have one at my wedding, but my little brother insisted on being the flower boy, and it was awesome.", "Which is why I said NAH. I don\u2019t think OP is wrong for not wanting to do it. I understand that just because I may not find something to be a big deal doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t to others. \n\nFrankly, this wouldn\u2019t bother me. But that\u2019s me. OP has every right to say \u201cnope, not for me.\u201d As such, she\u2019s not an AH. \n\nI don\u2019t think the expectations make the bride an AH either.

She\u2019s likely to have a melt down in the middle of the wedding if she gets tired, or bored. I\u2019ve seen plenty of wedding videos where the kids decide they\u2019ve had enough, and Nope right out, or have a tantrum. A day long wedding is a long stretch for a four year old. Get a babysitter and leave her home. You\u2019ll enjoy the wedding much more.", "Any four-year-old who would hold a grudge would have a parent prompting the grudge.  Four-year-olds haven't spent the last dozen years tearing clippings out of wedding zines!", "I didn\u2019t say grudge, only thought that she may be disappointed and I imagine it can be upsetting for the parent to disappoint their child too."]}
