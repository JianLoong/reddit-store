They begged and pleaded for us to find a sitter, but we declined.\n\nSoon after all the parents of the children in the wedding party followed suit. The were in danger of losing nearly their entire wedding party (most of the party were parents of the children in question) for the reception. They very quickly changed their minds and allowed the children in the wedding party to attend the reception. \n\nWhile I don't expect your situation to play out like this, you should stand your ground.
