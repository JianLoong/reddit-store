I'm sure she'd have a lot of fun being the flower girl, but it'll also be a long and exhausting day, and I think it's weird to only invite certain members of your wedding party to only parts of your wedding.

It's bordering on callous that she literally doesn't care how much extra effort that takes.\n\nI'd either go fully child-free and get a sitter for the whole event, or take my kid and they stay with me for 100% of the event.

She has 3 months to find someone else.   Or she can get married without a FG", "NTA\n\nThis is completely unreasonable. Anyone who is a part of the wedding should not be excluded from the day's events. Your child is not a prop, and this feels like she is just using your daughter as a prop.", "NTA. She's using your child as essentially a prop in her wedding, like a bouquet of flowers!!", "NTA\n\nThe bride is entitled to ask for no children at part of the day, but has to own the consequences, and in this case, the consequence might be that you choose that your daughter won't be participating.", "NTA. This is Bridezilla territory.", "NTA...She's free to have any kind of wedding she likes, but that doesn't mean her potential guests have to participate.  It seems like your daughter is being used as an ornament.", "NTA, it's totally reasonable for you to say that the logistics of this make it difficult - having to arrange passing her back and forth is going to be tricky.\n\nAs you say, it's fine for the bride to ask for this, as she wants your daughter to be involved in the day but also wants a child-free wedding - both of which are fine.  But if you have to pull her out, the bride should accept that without complaint, not try to make you feel bad about it.", "NTA. Committed to her about the flower girl? Like is she worried she'll have to use an understudy or worse, have no flowers at all? If anything children are more disruptive during the ceremony where it needs to be quiet for a long time.\n\nShe added more info that doesn't suit you. It doesn't make sense to just go for the ceremony and you can't easily send your daughter home without you or lock her in the carz so not going ar all is the logical solution.", "NTA.  I would flat out ask the bride what you and 4 year old are supposed to do during the reception then.  Not attend?  You're not going to abandon your 4 year old.  And if she says yes then tell her to f off.  Seriously.", "NTA. It is rude of her to expect your kid to be in the ceremony and pictures but not to be around for the cake or the party.", "My ex-wife and I faced a similar situation years ago with her brother and his now-wife. They planned this big wedding. Asked all their nieces and nephews to be flower girls and ring bearers, and then declared the reception child-free, including the children in the wedding party.\n\nWe decided we would let our kids participate because they were young, but old enough to understand what they'd been asked to do and were excited, and we'd already purchased their outfits for the wedding, but we told the couple we wouldn't be attending the reception. They begged and pleaded for us to find a sitter, but we declined.\n\nSoon after all the parents of the children in the wedding party followed suit. The were in danger of losing nearly their entire wedding party (most of the party were parents of the children in question) for the reception. They very quickly changed their minds and allowed the children in the wedding party to attend the reception. \n\nWhile I don't expect your situation to play out like this, you should stand your ground. Either allow her to partake in the wedding but refuse to attend both the rehearsal dinner and the reception, or just back out of the whole thing entirely. They should have told you up front that she wasn't invited. NTA", "NTA\n\nShe wants your daughter as a prop for part of the day at your inconvenience and cost.

She wants your daughter as a prop only.", "definitely NTA\n\nwhat she\u2019s asking for is completely unreasonable, given your description of the logistics in getting your daughter to and from the rehearsal dinner & ceremony.", "NTA - she is asking your daughter to be part of the ceremony. That earns her a place at the reception. Your child isn't her wedding prop.", "NTA.  Your child is either invited to the wedding or she isn't.  To do it her way puts so much unnecessary burden on you and treats your daughter like a prop.", "NTA your daughter is more than a prop for photos", "NTA\n\n if she wants to use your daughter as an accessory then she can suck it up and allow her to be at the wedding party as well, or find an adult flower girl smh", "NTA\n\nYour friend should've made it absolutely clear to you when she first asked for your daughter to be a flower girl what her expectations are. Casually dropping a bunch of extra logistical stuff in your lap with less than ~~two~~ (EDIT - **three**, I can't count) months to go, and expecting you to be happy with it, is unreasonable and I think she's asking too much of you. I'm not even a parent, but I imagine trying to shuffle a four year old from place to place for two days is the last thing you want to be dealing with on top of your bridesmaid duties.\n\n>She's upset with me because she says I've already committed to her that my daughter would be a flower girl, and she wants to share this day with her.\n\nUnless you have signed a legally-binding contract to this commitment, you're well within your right to pull your daughter out of the wedding. Also, your friend's 'I want to share my day with your daughter' stuff doesn't really wash when she's going to be excluded from the vast majority of it.", "NTA. You either want children in your wedding because you love those children and want them around (even if they have to leave at one point in the evening because they are too young or the party is late in the evening) for your wedding, or you have a childfree wedding. Both fine. \n\nBut you don\u2019t use children like this, just as you put up decorations. They are human beings, not flowers or balloons. So treat them as guests or don\u2019t invite them at all.", "Definitely NTA. Your child is not just some showpiece to be used and cast aside. If I was the groom it would make me think twice about marrying such an obnoxious person.

I'd pull my daughter out.  NTA.", "NTA - I get the whole childfree wedding thing, but to ask a child to participate and then treat them like a pariah and expect the parents to do all kinds of extra running around, etc., is just wrong.  Either let the kids who are serving as set dressing for your fancy \"Cast of Thousands\" event have some of the fun or go hire actors you can just dismiss when their part in the show is over.", "NTA. And having to explain to her that she can't do any of the fun stuff would suck.", "NTA why in the world couldn't she go to the rehearsal dinner?", "NTA...\n\nIn cases like this, the bride and groom normally set up childcare for their wedding participants.  That way the children are being taken care of and everyone can have a good time.\n\nSo, politely bow your daughter out of this logistical nightmare.  The bride wanted this circus, the bride can accept the consequences of her decision.", "NTA\n\nWhy have a child free wedding or reception if you want children in the wedding... It is unreasonable to ask your daughter to be in the wedding and expect you to go back and forth multiple times to not include your kid in parts of the day.", "Tell her that your daughter is a living being and not some marriage decoration prop", "Nta. Tell her you completely understand and that you discussed this with your daughter who asked if she have that day without selfish assholes. So your daughter respectfully declines", "NTA. People are not props, regardless of age.", "NTA. Either she want children at the wedding or she doesn't. Your child is being used as an accessory for the pictures basically.", "ooooooof this is a tough one.\n\nmy friend recently had a child-free wedding but had children of the bridal party in the ceremony. they went home/were picked up between ceremony and reception tho. there was like a 2 hour time span between\n\ni'd say nah. she should have told you ahead of time that the reception was child free though. so slight ah to her.", "NTA.\n\nThe bride should have told you this info when she asked you about your daughter being a flower girl. You did not have pertinent information when you agreed. I would probably still have my 4 year old do it if it was logistically possible for me. (Local wedding, someone I trust being able to watch her, things like that.) \n\nBut if you don't want to deal with that, it doesn't make you an AH. \n\nAsk yourself if you would have said yes at the beginning, if you knew then what you know now, and be honest with yourself. \n\n(I had my daughter picked up from 3 different weddings when she was little, even though they weren't child-free.

I can appreciate to some extent that some people want a child free wedding, then those folks need to exclude having a flower girl or ring boy, etc.   One possible solution is to have your daughter attend the reception for a shortened period of time.

I had my MOH\u2019s daughter as a flower girl and naturally her brother had to be there too.
