Be ready to stick to your boundaries, you simply cannot leave these young children outside with no supervision", "NTA. But please do not leave your nephews outside alone. If your sister drops them off and leaves after you told her not to, either call the police or CPS and report abandoned children.", "Is there some way you can not be home? I think the right thing to do would be to text her and say I will not be watching your children again and I will not be home during the day. If you drop them off at my house my camera will see them and I will call the police from wherever I am and tell them you abandoned your children on the porch when you know nobody is home. \n\nYou can't just leave children on the porch. You can call the police and tell them you did not agree to watch these children and their mother abandoned them on your porch. Y T A if you leave them standing on the porch, NTA for calling the police or CPS.", "NTA for not wanting to watch them, she\u2019s obviously using you but your plan of putting them in danger to teach her a lesson is a bad one. Call the cops and claim child abandonment, but make sure they are somewhere safe.", "So, you have posted two VERY different things in your title and your actual post, which makes this difficult to judge. There is a vast difference between telling your sister you won't watch your nephews, and LEAVING SMALL CHILDREN SITTING OUTSIDE BY THEMSELVES INDEFINITELY. \n\nUltimately, you're NTA for telling her you won't watch them, but . . .\n\n>Would I be the asshole if I didn\u2019t open the door tomorrow.\n\nYes, of course you'd be a massive AH if you did this. Jesus, you can't leave a baby sitting outdoors with an 11- and 9-year-old indefinitely. What is wrong with you?! You don't get to endanger children because you're pissed off. SMFH.\n\nIf you've told her in advance that you won't watch them, and she's still abandoning them at your place, then the solution is to call the cops and report exactly that: that the children have been abandoned at your home. \n\nWhen she drops them off, bring them inside so that they are safe, call the police non-emergency line, and explain that you found your nephews abandoned outside your home, that this is not the first time that she has done this, and that they were left there without any communication or agreement regarding their care . . . that on the contrary, you had specifically let her know that you cannot care for them, and she left them outside your home and took off without even making sure that you were home or available. The cops will take it from there. You're NTA for not wanting to watch them, or even for reporting her - honestly, she's neglectful AF and it's probably a good idea for the authorities to intervene, even if it's just to force parenting classes - but you will absolutely be the AH if you leave them out there.", "I would go back to work. I would tell my sister I would not be home. In the morning I would be gone. \n\nI would tell my sister if she dumbs her kids you will call the cops. Stop enabling her by taking the kids. You have to follow throw. Show her actions will have consequences.\n\n\nI would install a ring doorbell. If she dumbs the kids. Call the cops. Go back to work.\n\nStop making your kids and husband sacrifice for your sister. Having 3 extra kids daily is expensive. It\u2019s taking money away for things your kids need. Her kids are not your responsibility.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
