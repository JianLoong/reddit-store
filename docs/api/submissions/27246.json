Our mother passed away when she was 11 and I was 2 and a  half and my dad shortly remarried to my mom who raised me. My sister didn\u2019t really have that same connection with my mom, as my mom did with me. My sister and my mother didn\u2019t really get along at all when she was starting college and after college when she went to stay with us. My mom would always say that she didn\u2019t understand my sister and she struggled to heal the relationship. Long story short my mom wrote a letter to her that was kind of her idea of trying to connect with her and my sister took it wrong and then estranged herself from my parents. Also she\u2019s very religious and I am not (I swear it will make sense) \n\nSo a few years have  passed  and me (20F) and my sister (29 F) went on a trip to Nebraska to see family for a weekend. We had a pretty good time for the most part. It was nice seeing family. I also kind of enjoyed hanging out with my sister. We used to fight like cats and dogs and I feel like now that we are adults, we get a chance to be friends. Then the night before our trip came and we were hanging out with our cousins and staying up late. \n\nWe were talking about ghost stories and my sister decided it would be a good time to preach to me about god and stuff. I snapped a little bit I said \u201cyou don\u2019t need to preach to me\u201d  and promptly apologized because it was rude, but couldn\u2019t let it go. She asked me why I made that comment I said \u201cI was being rude and defensive and I\u2019m sorry\u201d she then started to insinuate that it was something that has to do with mom mistreating or something. Trying to analyze my statement as if there is some deeper meaning. All I truly meant when I said that was that I hated being preached at. I\u2019m not religious and she doesn\u2019t need to say that to me. Frankly I was being a dick but nothing more than that. Then it turned into her sobbing about how mom and dad don\u2019t understand her and hear her.  She went on this whole tangent about it.  She and my parents have put me in the middle of this stupid fight of theirs and I honestly had it I said \u201cRachel I don\u2019t care about your problem with mom and dad. If you need to say something to mom and dad then say it to them. Stop using me as a sound board.\u201d Then she didn\u2019t say anything  and ran down stairs for the rest of the trip home didn\u2019t talk to me \nAITA for this ?", "created_utc": 1695159201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16n34ow/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_dont_care_about_her/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She presumably remembers, and still misses and mourns, your late biological mother.  For you, your dad's current wife is the woman who raised you, your mother.\n\nAs for \"healing\" the relationship with your mother/her step-mother, healing is for when something was whole and healthy, and it was broken or damaged in some way.\n\nBut it sounds as if your sister and your father's second wife never developed the relationship that his wife was hoping for.  And you can't \"heal\" something that never existed in the first place.\n\nYour sister and your mother should not be putting you in the middle of their relationship issues.  Your mother should not be expecting your sister to develop the same sorts of feelings for her that you have, because your sister remembers her mother, and that creates a far more fraught situation with any new adult woman that was brought into your family home.  \n\nAnd you need to recognize that your relationship with your mother is something that is difficult for your sister to observe.  When you see your mother as just your mother, your sister is reminded of what she is missing, an uncomplicated relationship with her mother, and what you lost without realizing it - any chance at fond memories of or a relationship with your biological mother, a person who should have been important in your life, but whom you'll never know. \n\nMothers are not fungible commodities.  If your mother were to die now, and your father was to remarry in a year or two, you would not have his new wife slip painlessly into the spot of the mother who raised you and whom you love. \n\nYou might try asking your sister about the situation.  What she remembers of your biological mother.  If there is anything about your biological mother that she wished you knew.  What she feels that her relationship with your dad's current wife should be, versus what it is, versus what your parents are wanting it to be.  How she feels about you considering your mother to be just your mother, no asterisk, when you have no memory of life with your biological mother.\n\nBut be clear that while she can explain how she feels, you don't want to be a sounding board or go-between.  And she cannot expect you to feel the same way.  \n\nAlso, take note if your mother is using you as an example of how your sister should accept her, despite the age difference and the very significant difference in how each of you remember your biological mother.  And if she is using you in this way, against your sister, stop her and remind her that your sister remembers and loves your biological mother in a way that you can't, and she should not expect your sister to act as if she has no memories as you do.\n\nThe fact that the two of you are in very different positions when it comes to relating with your mother/stepmother/father's wife doesn't have to result in a painful relationship between the two of you as sisters, as long as you both can respect how the other feels about the whole blended family situation.", "NTA, I think you're right that she needs to speak to your parents if she has something she wants to say.", "\u201cFrankly I was being a dick but nothing more than that.\u201d probably the best way to summarize this situation. Kinda sounds like she was opening up to you and you sort of dismissed her feelings, which is sort of an AH move. \n\nI understand not wanting to be in the middle of such a complex situation, and it\u2019s okay to ask her not to talk about god, but she\u2019s had a different experience with your mom and it\u2019s also valid and her talking about it (idk exactly what she said so maybe I\u2019m wrong) doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she\u2019s putting you in between them.", "I think it was probably dishonest to say you \u2018don\u2019t care about her problem.\u2019 Sounds like you do care because her fight with your parents is affecting your relationships with your whole family.

Super weird of the sister to insert religion randomly, but that's kinda how those folks are sometimes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust seems like two people who don't understand each other, really.", "I'm not sure that the sister wants to improve her relationship with OP's mother. (Or at least, not to \"improve\" the relationship with OP's mother to be like OP's relationship with her mother, or to be what OP's mother wishes it was.) \n\nI'm thinking that she wants OP, as a sister who is now an adult, to understand her better, and is expressing herself in a less-than-effective way. To OP, the sister trying to explain how she feels and why she feels that way comes across as trying to somehow get OP to patch things up between her sister and her mother.", "I understand your comment and I have noticed that too. The main point of the post was that she was putting me in the middle of a problem that wasn\u2019t mine. Though I appreciate you saying that", "I wasn\u2019t trying to be dishonest\u2026.", "Hmm...\n\nI'm wondering if the sister turned to organized religion as a way to try to find a place where she felt as if she was accepted, and belonged, when her home life felt all-wrong.\n\nAside from the religion itself, organized religion often provides a structured social setting with community support.  A teenager who was uncomfortable at home might find a youth group with friends her own age, the parents of those friends being welcoming, involvement in charitable activities and volunteering, etc.  \n\nOP's sister was 11 when her mother died.  I'm guessing 12 or 13 when their father remarried.  That's an awkward age to try to blend into a new family.  Unlike OP, too old to just accept her father's new wife as mother without the ghost of her own mother hovering, yet not an adult able to simply accept the new wife as her father's new wife, with all of them independent adults.  \n\nA space, both physically and socially, where she wasn't facing that pressure, and where she could find the support of others in a socially acceptable way, was probably a lifeline.", "You don't deserve to be in the middle of her problem.\n\nBut your situation means that you're a part of the problem she's struggled to deal with for nearly two decades.  Not that you are at fault, but that you're an intrinsic part of a fraught situation.\n\nYour mother died.  Your father remarried, and was looking forward, focusing on the new relationship, not back at the old one.  You had no memory of losing your mother, and were content with your new mother.  (Who by all indications was the mother you needed at the time.)  Your sister, however, was probably feeling very marginalized, as she's wondering \"what about mom? Why isn't anyone else missing mom?\" And she probably wasn't getting any answers that made sense to her, or met her emotional needs.\n\nYou might try telling her ***\"I know you miss the mother we were born to.  I know it is difficult for you to see me happy with my mom now, and not remembering or missing the mother I was born to.  I cannot help the fact that I was too young to remember when the mother we were born to died.  I know you remember her, and that she has a special place in your life and memories.  I respect where you are, and I need you to respect where I am.\"***\n\nYou might also consider asking her to write some stories about your birth mother for you, to share a bit of the memory she has but you don't.  Someday, you may well be curious, or your kids may be curious about the situation. You don't want to put that off until it is too late to ask.\n\n(Note, my mother's biological mother died giving birth to her younger sister when my mother was two.  Neither girl remembered her, and her father quickly remarried, and his new wife had two sons.  They didn't find out about the situation until they were teenagers, and had no one to ask about the situation.  I didn't find out until I was in my 20s.  The combination of not knowing, and knowing that you have no way to find out anything, is difficult.  Get answers and stories while you can. Advice from one grumpy old lady on the internet, take it for what it is worth.)", "Fair enough. NTA regardless, it\u2019s not fair that you are in the middle."]}
