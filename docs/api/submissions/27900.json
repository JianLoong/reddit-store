We were together for 18 years and have four daughters aged 17, 14, 5, and 4. Despite our separation, my wife and I remain on amicable terms. She resides in our marital home, while I'm currently living in our rental property.\r  \n\r  \nApproximately four months ago, I rekindled a relationship with a former college girlfriend who's 47. We were together for five years back in the day, but parted ways because she wasn\u2019t ready to settle and have kids. She now has a 13-year-old daughter.\r  \n\r  \nA notable issue has arisen between my eldest daughter, who's turning 18 soon, and my girlfriend. My daughter is assertive, outspoken, and holds strong to her principles. She's very bonded with her mother. On the other hand, my girlfriend is quite strict with her own child. She sets clear boundaries, including computer usage limits, basic phones, no TV during school days, and has various disciplinary measures. In contrast, my wife and I have been much more relaxed parents. Our kids have more freedom with their devices, social activities, and we're more lenient when it comes to discipline.\r  \n\r  \nLast night, a situation escalated. My daughters, girlfriend, and her child gathered at my place after school. The plan was for the kids to finish homework, have dinner, and then for us to have a family game night. However, my oldest was engrossed in Instagram and YouTube, which led my girlfriend\u2019s daughter to request similar screen time. \r  \n\r  \nWhen my girlfriend suggested my eldest put away her laptop to join the game, my daughter declined. My girlfriend insisted, emphasizing the importance of family time. My daughter firmly reiterated her decision to abstain. As I entered the scene, my girlfriend, in front of everyone, said I should intervene. My daughter, clearly frustrated, asserted that my girlfriend isn't her mother and left the room.\r  \n\r  \nI communicated to my girlfriend that while my daughter\u2019s tone could've been better, I\u2019ve never imposed strict family time, and she was preoccupied. Upset, my girlfriend promptly left with her daughter.

Even the 5 and 4 year old will know the difference between someone they see only occasionally and actual family, such as you, their mother, and their siblings.  The little ones will, properly, remain focused on their mother for a mother-figure, not your girlfriend.  They will, also properly, look to their older siblings as role models for dealing with this situation, and the older siblings will, properly, be telling them that their mother is their mother, and no one else is, because that is the factual truth.\n\nFurther, rules that might be appropriate for a 13 year old are not going to be appropriate for a 17 year old.  Rules need to be age-appropriate, and rules for a 13 year old whose mother has kept her very sheltered are not appropriate for a 17 year old who needs to have the skills to navigate the world as an adult, without parental controls.\n\nAnd the odds of finding any game or activity that would be equally enjoyable for children ranging in age from 4 to 17, plus 2 adults in their 40s, is near-zero. Even for the four siblings, and even more adding a 13 year old near-stranger to the mix.  Who on earth thought a \"family game night\" would work at all for this eclectic group of people?\n\nYour girlfriend is deeply misguided to imagine that she can expect your children to follow her rules, especially the older ones.  What has she done to earn the respect of a 17 year old, that would lead the 17 year old to think they should respect the rules she sets for her 13 year old child?\n\nYour girlfriend is not your children's mother.  She and her daughter are not family.  The fact that you date her, or even if you eventually marry her, won't create any emotional family bond between your children and them, especially your older children.\n\nYou need to set some clear boundaries with your girlfriend.  She can't make rules for your kids, especially the older ones.  She can't expect them to regress to the level or parental control her daughter lives with, when they are working to develop skills of independence.  She can't expect \"respect\" that means \"obedience\" rather than \"polite manners for the adult guest of a parent.\"  (Which for a teenager generally means \"greet them politely, small-talk at the dinner table, and stay out of the way.\")\n\nYour girlfriend seems to be working to tank any potential relationship she might have with your older kids.

She is not a parent to your daughter, the rules of her household do not apply to your children, and she should have asked you before trying to apply them to your children.\n\nAlso, I'm wondering if anyone asked your daughter if she wanted to take part int he plan, or if it was simply assumed she would go along with it, or if she was simply told she would. By your own description, she has not grown up in a household where this is common, and she is 17, almost an adult and capable of making her own decisions.

She is not doing herself or her relationship with them any favors by walking into their home and giving orders first thing.", "NTA.

Wow, that's heavy after only 4 months.  Your gf already trying to impose her parenting views on your children is bad enough, to a near-adult on top of that, mostly because she can't tell her own child that different rules are currently in place for both sets of kids, is a red flag.

Your daughter is almost an adult. It was definitely NOT your girlfriend\u2019s place to make a request like that.", "NTA (currently). Your girlfriend has an authoritarian parenting style and you do not. It\u2019s unsurprising a person with this type of parenting style would assume that their way is the best/only way to successfully parent. \n\nPeople with this mindset are generally rigid and emotionally distant in all their relationships. With their kids, this comes out as harsh/disproportionate punishments and demanding/unrealistic expectations. Basically she parents with an iron fist and any deviation from her wishes isn\u2019t tolerated.

Why on earth is she \"telling\" her to do anything? Your gf has one child to parent. And your nearly adult daughter isn't her. \n\nVery good job standing up for your kid, anyone would have been just as frustrated as she was in thst situation.

And four months of dating while still legally married to your children's mother does not create a new blended family.  \n\nIf anything, it's going to be harmful to the kids to expect them to accept a new girlfriend/boyfriend of their parent as \"family\" so soon, especially as dating relationships often don't last, and the kids don't need the stress of being repeatedly pressured to bond with a new stranger, only to then have that person disappear from their life to be replaced with some other stranger who is suddenly \"family.\"\n\nIt's a bit much to expect kids to accept a divorce even faster than the legal system.  \n\nA 17 year old knows enough to laugh at the concept that  dad's girlfriend of 4 months is \"family.\"  But the 4 and 5 year olds, if they accept this, will be devastated if the relationship doesn't work out, and another person they've bonded with is out of their lives, and they're supposed to accept the next girlfriend."]}
