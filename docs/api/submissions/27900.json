She resides in our marital home, while I'm currently living in our rental property.\r  \n\r  \nApproximately four months ago, I rekindled a relationship with a former college girlfriend who's 47.

She now has a 13-year-old daughter.\r  \n\r  \nA notable issue has arisen between my eldest daughter, who's turning 18 soon, and my girlfriend. My daughter is assertive, outspoken, and holds strong to her principles. She's very bonded with her mother. On the other hand, my girlfriend is quite strict with her own child. She sets clear boundaries, including computer usage limits, basic phones, no TV during school days, and has various disciplinary measures. In contrast, my wife and I have been much more relaxed parents. Our kids have more freedom with their devices, social activities, and we're more lenient when it comes to discipline.\r  \n\r  \nLast night, a situation escalated. My daughters, girlfriend, and her child gathered at my place after school. The plan was for the kids to finish homework, have dinner, and then for us to have a family game night. However, my oldest was engrossed in Instagram and YouTube, which led my girlfriend\u2019s daughter to request similar screen time. \r  \n\r  \nWhen my girlfriend suggested my eldest put away her laptop to join the game, my daughter declined. My girlfriend insisted, emphasizing the importance of family time. My daughter firmly reiterated her decision to abstain. As I entered the scene, my girlfriend, in front of everyone, said I should intervene.

Even the 5 and 4 year old will know the difference between someone they see only occasionally and actual family, such as you, their mother, and their siblings.  The little ones will, properly, remain focused on their mother for a mother-figure, not your girlfriend.  They will, also properly, look to their older siblings as role models for dealing with this situation, and the older siblings will, properly, be telling them that their mother is their mother, and no one else is, because that is the factual truth.\n\nFurther, rules that might be appropriate for a 13 year old are not going to be appropriate for a 17 year old.  Rules need to be age-appropriate, and rules for a 13 year old whose mother has kept her very sheltered are not appropriate for a 17 year old who needs to have the skills to navigate the world as an adult, without parental controls.\n\nAnd the odds of finding any game or activity that would be equally enjoyable for children ranging in age from 4 to 17, plus 2 adults in their 40s, is near-zero. Even for the four siblings, and even more adding a 13 year old near-stranger to the mix.  Who on earth thought a \"family game night\" would work at all for this eclectic group of people?\n\nYour girlfriend is deeply misguided to imagine that she can expect your children to follow her rules, especially the older ones.  What has she done to earn the respect of a 17 year old, that would lead the 17 year old to think they should respect the rules she sets for her 13 year old child?\n\nYour girlfriend is not your children's mother.  She and her daughter are not family.  The fact that you date her, or even if you eventually marry her, won't create any emotional family bond between your children and them, especially your older children.\n\nYou need to set some clear boundaries with your girlfriend.  She can't make rules for your kids, especially the older ones.  She can't expect them to regress to the level or parental control her daughter lives with, when they are working to develop skills of independence.  She can't expect \"respect\" that means \"obedience\" rather than \"polite manners for the adult guest of a parent.\"  (Which for a teenager generally means \"greet them politely, small-talk at the dinner table, and stay out of the way.\")\n\nYour girlfriend seems to be working to tank any potential relationship she might have with your older kids.  Make sure she doesn't bring down your relationship with your older kids in the process, where they feel they have been pushed aside in favor of the household focusing on your girlfriend and her daughter and what the girlfriend wants her daughter's life to be like.", "So you started dating this woman four months after you and your wife of 18 years separated and you\u2019ve already brought her around your children and she\u2019s trying to force family time?

Not giving children, especially teens, any sort of autonomy can also hinder their ability to make decisions for themselves as adults.  \n\nIt also didn't sound like your daughter was particularly rude the first two times she declined the \"invitation.\"  I'd eventually have an attitude too if someone kept pushing me when I had already said no to something.", "You are dating, right?

She is not a parent to your daughter, the rules of her household do not apply to your children, and she should have asked you before trying to apply them to your children.\n\nAlso, I'm wondering if anyone asked your daughter if she wanted to take part int he plan, or if it was simply assumed she would go along with it, or if she was simply told she would. By your own description, she has not grown up in a household where this is common, and she is 17, almost an adult and capable of making her own decisions. It would have been polite to have asked her first as opposed to simply telling her.\n\nYour GF is new to your kids' lives.

She is not doing herself or her relationship with them any favors by walking into their home and giving orders first thing.", "NTA. It's a lot easier to enforce structure and limitations with a singular child than with a large family. Your GF wants you to match her parenting expectations with kids that don't belong to her.

Wow, that's heavy after only 4 months.  Your gf already trying to impose her parenting views on your children is bad enough, to a near-adult on top of that, mostly because she can't tell her own child that different rules are currently in place for both sets of kids, is a red flag.

Your daughter is almost an adult. It was definitely NOT your girlfriend\u2019s place to make a request like that.", "NTA (currently). Your girlfriend has an authoritarian parenting style and you do not. It\u2019s unsurprising a person with this type of parenting style would assume that their way is the best/only way to successfully parent. \n\nPeople with this mindset are generally rigid and emotionally distant in all their relationships. With their kids, this comes out as harsh/disproportionate punishments and demanding/unrealistic expectations. Basically she parents with an iron fist and any deviation from her wishes isn\u2019t tolerated.

Why on earth is she \"telling\" her to do anything? Your gf has one child to parent. And your nearly adult daughter isn't her. \n\nVery good job standing up for your kid, anyone would have been just as frustrated as she was in thst situation.
