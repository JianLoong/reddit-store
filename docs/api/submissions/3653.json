So recently some friends and family gathered to watch a Football match at the World Cup, Spain vs Germany, my sister\u2019s bf and my bf also joined to watch the match.\n\nAs the match was getting more interesting, we started talking about some players from both countries and I mentioned some like: Mario G\u00f6tze, Thomas M\u00fcller, Leon Goretza, Manuel Neuer, Lukas Klostermann etc. At this point I was speaking Spanish and wasn\u2019t pronouncing the names \u201ccorrectly\u201d as if it was German because that\u2019s nonsense, I mean I was speaking Spanish, and pronouncing names in another languages is just weird, so I just pronounce it as a Spanish speaking person would do it and in a way that it makes sense in the language since some German phonetics don\u2019t exist In Spanish. I do this with other languages too, If I\u2019m speaking French and I have to say an English name or place I say it as it makes sense in the language even if I know the \u201ccorrect\u201d way.

The match ended and everyone left, he also left but my sister was mad at me for humiliating him and she told me that he was mad because I should\u2019ve told him I speak German so he wouldn\u2019t have looked like a loser.\n\nI swear, I didn\u2019t do it to humiliate him, I was just tired of his attitude and wanted him to stop and I thought it was the only way (it worked) but I\u2019m also refusing to apologise as my sister wants me to because he is the one who started this was him.", "created_utc": 1669875503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9gh87/aita_for_speaking_a_language_just_to_shut_my/", "score": 451, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They decide that for themselves. A lot of times the issues arise with easy names like 'Marta' vs 'Martha' when people anglisise those names just because they don't have to think/put in the effort.
