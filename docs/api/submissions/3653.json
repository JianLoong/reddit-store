So recently some friends and family gathered to watch a Football match at the World Cup, Spain vs Germany, my sister\u2019s bf and my bf also joined to watch the match.\n\nAs the match was getting more interesting, we started talking about some players from both countries and I mentioned some like: Mario G\u00f6tze, Thomas M\u00fcller, Leon Goretza, Manuel Neuer, Lukas Klostermann etc. At this point I was speaking Spanish and wasn\u2019t pronouncing the names \u201ccorrectly\u201d as if it was German because that\u2019s nonsense, I mean I was speaking Spanish, and pronouncing names in another languages is just weird, so I just pronounce it as a Spanish speaking person would do it and in a way that it makes sense in the language since some German phonetics don\u2019t exist In Spanish. I do this with other languages too, If I\u2019m speaking French and I have to say an English name or place I say it as it makes sense in the language even if I know the \u201ccorrect\u201d way. My favourite is when I have to say \u201cWocestershire sauce\u201d in a foreign language, it sounds funny.\n\nSo as I stated above, my sister\u2019s BF was there too and he started \u201ccorrecting me\u201d to show me how to pronounce the player\u2019s names  correctly (he got them all wrong), I didn\u2019t say anything the first few times because I was just enjoying the match, but then he became so annoying correcting me at every German word I said. He didn\u2019t know I speak German, I speak 4 languages but I don\u2019t usually go telling everyone, so as I was tired of his behavior, I told him:\n\n*Ich hatte keine Ahnung dass Du Deutsch sprichst, Velleicht K\u00f6nnen Wir einmal \u00fcben damit Du mir helfen Kannst, meine Aussprache zu verbessen.* Which means: *I had no idea you speak German, maybe we get to practice once so you help me improve my pronunciation.* I know my German isn\u2019t perfect but I certainly know way more than him.\n\nHe didn\u2019t get a word because he doesn\u2019t speak the language and my sister looked at me pissed, so our other friends started laughing at him and he seemed really pissed, my BF (who was also tired of his attitude and comes from Austria btw) started speaking German to me and we exchanged some words. The match ended and everyone left, he also left but my sister was mad at me for humiliating him and she told me that he was mad because I should\u2019ve told him I speak German so he wouldn\u2019t have looked like a loser.\n\nI swear, I didn\u2019t do it to humiliate him, I was just tired of his attitude and wanted him to stop and I thought it was the only way (it worked) but I\u2019m also refusing to apologise as my sister wants me to because he is the one who started this was him.", "created_utc": 1669875503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9gh87/aita_for_speaking_a_language_just_to_shut_my/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Being overly corrected is annoying and if he didn't want to win stupid prizes he shouldn't have played stupid games.", "NTA that rules. I think you\u2019re right. On the news program Democracy Now the host, Amy Goodman, always makes a concerted effort to use native pronunciations. I always find it to be well intentioned when people make this effort but always annoying. \nOnce I heard her say \u201cChicago\u201d and she said it with a Chicago accent, and it\u2019s dumb how seem and accepted I felt. \nLol.", "NTA\n\nWhy are either of them complaining that you \u201chumiliated him\u201d when he tried to humiliate you by repeatedly correcting you? \n\nIf he wanted to be a smart ass he should have been ready to be corrected on things too", "NTA.", "\"That's how I was taught to pronounce it when I was learning the language, maybe my pronunciation is off.\" seems like a less awkward/confrontational way to deal with this whole situation.\n\nHe's for sure weird, but so are you.\n\nESH", "Hahahaha I love this \n\nNTA, he had that coming. I bet you're going to have a lot of interesting language related stories throughout your life! Keep doing what you love", ">wasn\u2019t pronouncing the names \u201ccorrectly\u201d as if it was German because that\u2019s nonsense\n\nNo, it's really not.  A person's name should be pronounced the way they pronounce it, if you are able to do so.  Even if the rest of the words you are saying are in another language.\n\nEdited:  At first I said Y T A for trying to show up (not just shut up) your sister's boyfriend by showing off your language skills.  But he was being an AH too, trying to mansplain how to pronounce all the names.  so... ESH", "I think ESH. It\u2019s annoying to have someone correct you constantly, so I understand why that would get on your nerves but your behavior here was sort of weird and showboat-y here too. He was technically correct about the name pronunciation thing but it seems like you both might have a bit of a superiority complex and incessant need to be right lol", "Nah, guy sounds like a wanna be know-it-all, who legitimately thinks he's better than other people and that he's the main character. A little verbal humbling is fine and pretty funny actually. Why should you have to tell someone you speak another language when you can watch them make an ass out of themselves instead?\n\nIt's his own fault for lying xD", "I get what you are doing. If you pronounce the names in their original languages instead of the one you are speaking, the people you are talking to may not even understand who you are talking about. Also, going back and forth between two languages can kind of block the flow of speech, it feels weird. \nHowever, you could have told him what you were doing the first time he corrected you: \"oh yeah, I know it\u2019s pronounced XYZ in German but I prefer the Spanish pronunciation when I\u2019m speaking Spanish\". \nSimple, effective but maybe not show off enough for you? ESH.", "I\u2019m going to say ESH because he was constantly correcting you and being annoying. However, you don\u2019t get to pronounce people\u2019s names however you want to depending on the language you\u2019re speaking. You should know better, and he didn\u2019t deserve being humiliated.", "Haha. NTA. The guy was being an ass to you so you spoke to him in the language he was correcting you on. That seems reasonable to me. Why is your sister ok with him trying to act superior to you by correcting you? If he was embarrassed or humiliated it was something he brought on himself. And an important life lesson about assuming things about other people. And, your sister could have quietly told him that you speak 4 languages.", "ESH\n\nYou are very wrong on the name thing...you pronounce peoples names their way, do not be so arrogant to change their names. Learn their names.\n\nOne of my fave things is listening to Welsh news...Gaelic with the odd English word dropped in is delightful.\n\nJust because you \"know a language\" does not give you the right to change people's names.\n\nSisters BF sounds like an AH but you were too!", "ESH\n\nThe correct way to pronounce a person\u2019s name is the way they (want you to) pronounce it. He wasn\u2019t wrong, but was a bit of an AH to keep correcting you when it served no purpose.\n\nYou were an AH for reacting in an over-the-top way. You could have just said why you were pronouncing them that way the first or second time he corrected you.\n\nTo sum up, you both acted immaturely and got caught up in your game of oneupmanship.", "YTA.

I have never joined a gathering and randomly announced what languages I speak, just in case someone might criticise me and feel as if I had set him up to make a fool of himself. \n\nThat said, when in a group of people to socialize or for a shared activity, it is considered polite to limit yourself to the language(s) the entire group shares so that nobody feels left out. You asked if you were TA for speaking a language to shut him up. No, you were provoked into doing it when he continually corrected you. (You didn't ask if your later side-conversation with your bf made you an AH, which it could have.)\n\nI tend to pronounce an individual's name in the manner that individual uses, but then my friend group rarely discusses celebrities and I am usually speaking of someone I actually know to someone who may also know them.", "NTA.

Gross social behaviour imo unless it is an existing dynamic.
