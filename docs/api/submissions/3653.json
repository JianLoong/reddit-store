The match ended and everyone left, he also left but my sister was mad at me for humiliating him and she told me that he was mad because I should\u2019ve told him I speak German so he wouldn\u2019t have looked like a loser.\n\nI swear, I didn\u2019t do it to humiliate him, I was just tired of his attitude and wanted him to stop and I thought it was the only way (it worked) but I\u2019m also refusing to apologise as my sister wants me to because he is the one who started this was him.", "created_utc": 1669875503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9gh87/aita_for_speaking_a_language_just_to_shut_my/", "score": 2779, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On the contrary, I wouldn't refer to former king Juan Carlos I as former king John Charles. \n\n[If the names are difficult to pronounce it's one thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfKZclMWS1U), but otherwise, for me, it can come across as a lack of respect. In particular there have been other AITA posts recently where people have complained about not being called their names, and somehow it doesn't apply when people are deliberately calling people by the wrong names.", "No.. language fullfil the requirement of communication. To achieve this you have to speak in a way that you are understood. Being right doesn't help you getting understood.\n\nHence pronouncing names differently in another language is helpful.", "> A person's name should be pronounced the way they pronounce it\n\nI think it sounds weird. In Belgium there was a newsreader who would do this. He'd talk in Dutch and then did his best to pronounce \"Tony Blair\" in the Queen's English. The contrast sounded goofy as hell. Even an American saying \"Tony Blair\" wouldn't do so in an English accent. There's a degree of adaptation to your own language and accent, which I believe is what OP is talking about.\n\nSimilarly, many people speaking English wouldn't pronounce Macron or Moulin Rouge with a French R, even if they know what a French R is supposed to sound like. It would sound weird in an English sentence.\n\n[The TV show Alles Kan Beter had a comedy sketch about it. (Dutch/Flemish)](https://youtu.be/CI4e_a7jICU?t=118)", "Some sounds are not in a language, and they wouldn't be able to make those even if you sound them out correctly for them a few times. Just let them keep their way of saying it. You can choose to say it correctly if you are speaking that language, but it's not something you need to do. Some people do they switch to that language completely and also start thinking in it, so they would pronounce things like that language would, and forget how they would do it if they were talking in another language.  \n\n\nI don't think OP was trying to show up, I would've probably shut someone up the same way. I've done something like it once, and took enjoyment in it, cause now that person no longer pretends to know it better\u2014some need to be taken down a notch this way.", "It\u2019s very common anyways. I\u2019m bilingual and adjust names to the language I currently am speaking, even if they\u2019re names from the second language of mine. It just would be hard to grasp for someone who doesn\u2019t speak both languages otherwise. They wouldn\u2019t even recognise the names sometimes.", "The key is not just to be able to do so, but also to be understood, so people you are talking to need to be able to properly parse what they hear. If the whole conversation was in Spanish, we can assume there were a lot of native Spanish speakers present. Our ability to parse what we hear heavily depends on our native language and then on our knowledge of the language we hear. That means that if other people had only limited knowledge of German, they would first hear gibberish and have take a second to process what they heard, as opposed to hearing the names pronounced in Spanish-like manner.\n\nThis is true not just for this particular case. For example, my name has a rolling R in it (I am not an English native), and while Spanish speakers have no trouble pronouncing the sound, as it is very similar in two languages, English speakers gravitate towards pronouncing the R the way it is done in English. Should I start policing everyone on that? No, the sound is close enough and they are not calling me a completely different name. Additionally, speakers of Chinese, Vietnamese and many other languages common in East Asia tend to struggle with my name as well. Should I start wreaking havoc because they need to add some placeholder vowels just to be able to pronounce my name? No, they are genuinely making an effort. \n\nAdditionally, Spanish and German (getting back to the post) have a lot of phonetical differences that mechanically, when spoken, require you to position your tongue and other parts necessary for speech (something we do unconsciously) in different manners. So in practice, if you want to pronounce the name the way it is said in its original language, you have to rearrange your speech apparatus to say one or two words, then rearrange it back. This slows the speech greatly, as now you have to add conscious thought to an action you perform unconsciously. Try going for a walk and then start thinking about exact movements of your legs and feet, how you have to bend your knee, move your thigh, align your foot with the ground, transfer your weight etc. That will give you an idea of what it is like to do a code switch in the middle of a sentence. \n\nOP provides perfect reasoning for pronouncing foreign names with Spanish accent while speaking Spanish.\n\nEdited for clarity.", "Yeah that take seems so weird to me. I\u2019d prefer people to pronounce my name correctly regardless of what language they are speaking at the time.", "I don't disagree with you but I think that is really the case when the person is there. Names are powerful and we should make every effort to correctly pronounce people's names. \n\nTo the person who has that name.\n\nBut when you are just in random conversation? I think it's important to try- and yeah, I think OP would ideally work on mixing German name pronunciations when saying a German name when he's speaking Spanish and vice versa. Just like I just to properly pronounce Polish/Chinese/whatever names when I speak English.\n\nIt isn't different. These aren't sounds that exists in English- at least not with those letter combination. But I put on my grown up pronunciation panties and deal with it.", "A lot of people assume that, but that\u2019s actually not the case! In the majority of cases, speakers of different languages will adapt the names they call themselves or others depending on the language they are speaking. \n\nFor example, those in the foreign-language community that I am a part of will call each other by the English version (not translation, but in terms of accent) of their names when speaking English.", "This is a ridiculous take.", "Is it still mansplaining if they're both guys?", "When  I was taking Japanese, we pronounced and wrote names to fit the language.

Again, I have a stupid simple name so that doesn't happen to me but I do have friends where, if they don't pronounce it correctly for someone, the other person will often pronounce it in such a way that embarrasses them because of what it otherwise sounds like (sorry I know that's vague, think Chinese \"Wang\" and what a monolingual English speaker would pronounce that as).", "as far as i know OP is neither spanish or german, so neither language is his native?\n\ni don't think that particularly matters though. i know lots of people who mispronounce words & names in their native language (or one of them when bi-lingual) because the person they are talking to would be confused/not understand. it's really common that people adjust their language to the person they are talking to, even when they know better.\n\npotentially your colleagues are speaking to english people so are mispronouncing it for that audience? but if it bothers you, just tell them. most people are reasonable & it's possible this isn't even a concious choice they are making.\n\nin OP's case though, these are not friends or people in the room... they are footballers on the tv. many languages pronounce celebrity/public figure names incorrectly, not due to any malicious intent, but just because that's how it's thought to be pronounced. if some of the footballers are recognised in spanish in their mispronunciated name, i don't think OP is wrong because as i said, could be more jarring & cause more confusion to say them correctly when in a full-blown discussion.", "That\u2019s weird to me, because here in the UK, we never called King Juan Carlos \u201cJohn Charles\u201d because his name was Juan Carlos.", "Would you ever use Nippon/Nihon when talking about Japan in English?

I do have friends however that really want their names pronounced correctly, not necessarily because they're pretentious, but because the common mispronunciation in their new country sounds embarrassing.

No \n\nAltough I've seen/heard worse.", "Oh for fuck's sake, I pronounce *my own name* differently when I speak different languages, because it's pronounced differently with different language rules.", "Meh disagree. I have a super French name (both first and last name) but when I\u2019m speaking to someone that doesn\u2019t speak French, I introduce myself with the English pronunciation, even though it\u2019s not technically the correct prononciation, because frankly it would sound douchey and self-important to pronounce it in a way I know the person either won\u2019t understand and/or won\u2019t be able to pronounce themselves.", "for sure! i never think the \"nah, that's too hard i'll do it my way\" is correct! & i always try to say someone's name how they want it said. \n\ni just think some sounds don't exist in some languages & make some names incredibly difficult for non-natives speakers. allowing a bit of wiggle room, or as i call it \"close enough\" is often a much better approach. i have yet to meet a non-english person who says my name correctly, even when i try to drill it in it just doesn't have an easy vowel-sound for some speakers, or uses a consonant that's never at the start for others, or it's similar to a really mundane word in that language so they keep calling me that, or whatever the issue. & when i can see people are trying, but it's genuinely too hard i settle for a \"close enough\", or a translation/nickname. \n\nfor me there's only so many times i can stop someone & correct how they are saying my name before i just feel like i am picking on them. if they're a native-english speaker i insist waaaay harder because i know we have the same sound families (my name is pronounced differently in american & i have drilled americans to get it right hahaha), but when working across languages i settle for a \"close enough\" & i'm sure i have friends who have accepted a \"close enough\" from me in return when i've been unable to get their name perfectly right... sometimes it can even be fun, like adopting an alter-ego.", "I mean it's my name so I know how it's pronounced but that's how I explain it some someone phonetically", "You seriously don't know anyone who goes by Jim in English-speaking circles and Diego around Spanish-speakers? George and Jorge (HOR-he)? Paul and Paolo? Andrew and Andr\u00e8s? Mary and Maria?", "...i do not control world languages & am not in charge of people translating his name. i am in fact english & call him charles, it was just an example that i know of where someone's name is commonly translated. like how we call jesus' mum mary but many other languages call her maria & in all likelihood her og name was probably mariam.", "Most seem to choose one or the other. Ie always \u201cGuillermo\u201d or always \u201cRichard\u201d"]}
