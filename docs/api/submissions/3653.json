The match ended and everyone left, he also left but my sister was mad at me for humiliating him and she told me that he was mad because I should\u2019ve told him I speak German so he wouldn\u2019t have looked like a loser.\n\nI swear, I didn\u2019t do it to humiliate him, I was just tired of his attitude and wanted him to stop and I thought it was the only way (it worked) but I\u2019m also refusing to apologise as my sister wants me to because he is the one who started this was him.", "created_utc": 1669875503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9gh87/aita_for_speaking_a_language_just_to_shut_my/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
