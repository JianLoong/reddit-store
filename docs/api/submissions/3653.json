The match ended and everyone left, he also left but my sister was mad at me for humiliating him and she told me that he was mad because I should\u2019ve told him I speak German so he wouldn\u2019t have looked like a loser.\n\nI swear, I didn\u2019t do it to humiliate him, I was just tired of his attitude and wanted him to stop and I thought it was the only way (it worked) but I\u2019m also refusing to apologise as my sister wants me to because he is the one who started this was him.", "created_utc": 1669875503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9gh87/aita_for_speaking_a_language_just_to_shut_my/", "score": 1743, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On the contrary, I wouldn't refer to former king Juan Carlos I as former king John Charles. \n\n[If the names are difficult to pronounce it's one thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfKZclMWS1U), but otherwise, for me, it can come across as a lack of respect. In particular there have been other AITA posts recently where people have complained about not being called their names, and somehow it doesn't apply when people are deliberately calling people by the wrong names.", "No.. language fullfil the requirement of communication. To achieve this you have to speak in a way that you are understood. Being right doesn't help you getting understood.\n\nHence pronouncing names differently in another language is helpful.", "> A person's name should be pronounced the way they pronounce it\n\nI think it sounds weird. In Belgium there was a newsreader who would do this. He'd talk in Dutch and then did his best to pronounce \"Tony Blair\" in the Queen's English. The contrast sounded goofy as hell. Even an American saying \"Tony Blair\" wouldn't do so in an English accent. There's a degree of adaptation to your own language and accent, which I believe is what OP is talking about.\n\nSimilarly, many people speaking English wouldn't pronounce Macron or Moulin Rouge with a French R, even if they know what a French R is supposed to sound like. It would sound weird in an English sentence.\n\n[The TV show Alles Kan Beter had a comedy sketch about it. (Dutch/Flemish)](https://youtu.be/CI4e_a7jICU?t=118)", "Some sounds are not in a language, and they wouldn't be able to make those even if you sound them out correctly for them a few times. Just let them keep their way of saying it. You can choose to say it correctly if you are speaking that language, but it's not something you need to do. Some people do they switch to that language completely and also start thinking in it, so they would pronounce things like that language would, and forget how they would do it if they were talking in another language.  \n\n\nI don't think OP was trying to show up, I would've probably shut someone up the same way. I've done something like it once, and took enjoyment in it, cause now that person no longer pretends to know it better\u2014some need to be taken down a notch this way.", "It\u2019s very common anyways. I\u2019m bilingual and adjust names to the language I currently am speaking, even if they\u2019re names from the second language of mine. It just would be hard to grasp for someone who doesn\u2019t speak both languages otherwise. They wouldn\u2019t even recognise the names sometimes.", "The key is not just to be able to do so, but also to be understood, so people you are talking to need to be able to properly parse what they hear. If the whole conversation was in Spanish, we can assume there were a lot of native Spanish speakers present. Our ability to parse what we hear heavily depends on our native language and then on our knowledge of the language we hear. That means that if other people had only limited knowledge of German, they would first hear gibberish and have take a second to process what they heard, as opposed to hearing the names pronounced in Spanish-like manner.\n\nThis is true not just for this particular case. For example, my name has a rolling R in it (I am not an English native), and while Spanish speakers have no trouble pronouncing the sound, as it is very similar in two languages, English speakers gravitate towards pronouncing the R the way it is done in English. Should I start policing everyone on that? No, the sound is close enough and they are not calling me a completely different name. Additionally, speakers of Chinese, Vietnamese and many other languages common in East Asia tend to struggle with my name as well. Should I start wreaking havoc because they need to add some placeholder vowels just to be able to pronounce my name? No, they are genuinely making an effort. \n\nAdditionally, Spanish and German (getting back to the post) have a lot of phonetical differences that mechanically, when spoken, require you to position your tongue and other parts necessary for speech (something we do unconsciously) in different manners. So in practice, if you want to pronounce the name the way it is said in its original language, you have to rearrange your speech apparatus to say one or two words, then rearrange it back. This slows the speech greatly, as now you have to add conscious thought to an action you perform unconsciously. Try going for a walk and then start thinking about exact movements of your legs and feet, how you have to bend your knee, move your thigh, align your foot with the ground, transfer your weight etc. That will give you an idea of what it is like to do a code switch in the middle of a sentence. \n\nOP provides perfect reasoning for pronouncing foreign names with Spanish accent while speaking Spanish.\n\nEdited for clarity.", "Yeah that take seems so weird to me. I\u2019d prefer people to pronounce my name correctly regardless of what language they are speaking at the time.", "I don't disagree with you but I think that is really the case when the person is there. Names are powerful and we should make every effort to correctly pronounce people's names. \n\nTo the person who has that name.\n\nBut when you are just in random conversation? I think it's important to try- and yeah, I think OP would ideally work on mixing German name pronunciations when saying a German name when he's speaking Spanish and vice versa. Just like I just to properly pronounce Polish/Chinese/whatever names when I speak English.\n\nIt isn't different. These aren't sounds that exists in English- at least not with those letter combination. But I put on my grown up pronunciation panties and deal with it.", "A lot of people assume that, but that\u2019s actually not the case! In the majority of cases, speakers of different languages will adapt the names they call themselves or others depending on the language they are speaking. \n\nFor example, those in the foreign-language community that I am a part of will call each other by the English version (not translation, but in terms of accent) of their names when speaking English.", "This is a ridiculous take.", "Is it still mansplaining if they're both guys?", "When  I was taking Japanese, we pronounced and wrote names to fit the language.

(i have lived in china, thailand, russia, italy, etc. people have been unable to say my name). \n\nlanguages that are very removed from each other with different alphabets entirely are harder. most south east asian students, when studying in europe or america, choose a \"european\" name to make their experiences abroad easier. sure, they shouldn't have to, but they do because they don't want a lifetime of correcting people. you learning to differentiate between julia & julia is FAR easier than you learning to differentiate between muchen (\u6c90\u5bb8) & muchen (\u6c90\u8fb0). i am not at all saying you would not try, or that you would not succeed, but it would be harder. \n\nwe grow up & learn how to speak all over the world differently. french speakers struggle more than german speakers with correct english pronunciation because of how both those languages differ from english. so some foreign names are easier & more digestible as a direct result of what our native language is... & the influence of celebrities also changes what names we become familiar with. \n\nas a person learning the name you can be as insistent as you want to get the name right, but as the person giving the name there comes a point where trying to force people to say your name in a way they cannot say, or can only say with great effort, comes across as unkind or like you're being nit-picky if they are unable to hear the nuances. it's always got to be a judgement call of where you are, the cultures you are dealing with, how comfortable you are, etc. there are so many variables that dismissing it all as \"that is a bunch of crap\" only shows how narrow-minded you actually are to others' experiences & pov.", ">am I expected to pronounce my name differently for the sake of everyone else?\n\nIt depends on the language, situation, and custom. In Japanese? Yes, you pronounce your own name as a Japanese person would pronounce it. \n\nIn English, are you talking about yourself or someone you know? Then pronounce it how you or they say it. \n\nAre you talking about a public official or sport person?

As an American English speaker, I would never pronounce his name as a British English speaker would, even though that\u2019s how he pronounces his own name. Now imagine some saying Tony Blair as a Spanish speaker who also speaks American English, speaking to someone in Spanish. Would they say \u201cTony Blair\u201d with a British accent in the middle of a sentence in Spanish? \n\nThen there\u2019s the hundreds of sounds that don\u2019t exist in all languages.
