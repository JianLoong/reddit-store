Love the people who love you.", "YTA your aunt was more of a mom than your actual mom but you\u2019re to blind to see that hope Ellie doesn\u2019t go to your wedding since clearly you think someone that didn\u2019t bother raising is more important", "I'm pretty sure that this post has solved the question of nature versus nurture.\n\nA selfish, immature, manipulative asshole abandons their daughter. Said daughter is raised by the selfless aunt who sacrifices much to raise that daughter and meet her needs. Said daughter treats aunt with disrespect, ingratitude, and entitlement.\n\nSome people are just born shitty. YTA OP.", "YTA. Reading your comments, you are just using your aunt. Yeah, it is your wedding, but your mother abandoned you. And your younger aunt stepped up. She was more of a mother to you than your own mother.\n\nIt is your wedding and you can choose who you want to walk you down the aisle. But you handled this incredibly cruelly.\n\nYour mother abandoned you during the hard part and your aunt was there. Your mother returned for the easy stuff and gets to show the world what a \u201cgood mother\u201d she is. I can understand why your aunt is hurt.", "\"This didn't go over well and she said she understood\" was her telling you she has opened her eyes to your ingratitude and will act accordingly in the future.", "YTA. Sometimes nature wins over nurture. Unfortunately in your case this is true.", "YTA big time", "She was for quite awhile and you say \u201c she didn\u2019t have to \u201c . That makes you an AH. Certainly you can have anyone\u2019s you wish walk you down the aisle. It appears you have a short memory.", "Well in a few years after all the bells and whistle and your mom disappear again, I hope you don't expect your aunt to step up from the bottom of her heart, cause that heart has sail.  \n\nYTA.  She didnt have to support you growing up but she did.  Your mom was MIA.  What is your mom going to say as mother of the bride?  \n\nWell I ditch my daughter to my mom amd sister to raise for decades and have only reconnected with her for the last 4 years.  All her milestones I should be talking about, I missed because I was not being a mom to her, but guess what, my sister WAS there for me.  \n\nBeing a mom is soo easy when you just have to show up in a dress for her wedding, get the spot light of walking her down the aisle, and get accolades for being the MOTHER of the bride when I never had to stay up late with a sick kid or deal with a hormonal teenager.", "OP\u2019s lack of self-awareness is annoying me! Im upset for Ellie. Lets see how helpful her mum if OP has kids because it sure looks like her aunt would be the reliable one.", "Seriously\u2026.OP is an asshole of the highest order and it seems like abandoning family when their existence inconveniences your plans for a happy future runs in the family. OP and OPs mom fell out of the jackass tree and hit every branch on the way down.", "But her aunt was three years younger & she stepped up to look after her! Her mum had her at 24 years old - thats not that young & she talks like she had her at 16 or something.", "Wow, that's cold. She stepped up when her sister bailed, but OP just shrugs that away. Maybe OP would have preferred foster care since mom couldn't be bothered to raise the child she birthed.", "She takes her aunt for granted so bad! She even said she\u2019s not worried about her being upset right now because she knows her aunt will always be there for her and yet she still chooses her absent mom over her reliable aunt. I just cant with OP, she doesnt deserve Ellie and with OPs attitude I hope Ellie distances herself since she now sees she doesnt mean anything to OP.", "I was on the fence until reading your comment here. YTA. Ellie is always there for you... because she's been acting as your mom. An aunt is not always going to be there for you, which is what you just told her she is.", ">  And Ellie is always there for me, so it's fine\n\nSeems like the apple didn't fall very far from the tree.", "Don\u2019t be surprised if the next time you need Ellie, she tells you she\u2019s not your mom and she doesn\u2019t owe you or have to do anything for you", "Ellie already replaced your mom when your mom decided that she didn't want to be a parent when you were a child", "Your mom did nothing for besides dump you on your aunt you\u2019re as pathetic as your mom", "God Lord. Do you hear yourself? And yes when somebody does something for you that they didn\u2019t need to do - that\u2019s when you owe them. When you do something that is expected or should do that\u2019s when you don\u2019t owe them. Your priorities are really messed up.", "Sounds like she\u2019s not going to be there for you anyone know that she knows how little you value her and the time she put into raising you. That said, it\u2019s your wedding and you\u2019re allowed to do what you want. But so are other people and I really wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this was the beginning of the end of this relationship", "\"Ellie can you help me?\"\n\n\"Lol No, I am not your mom\"", "Wow. You sound like the type of person you mother is\u2026.\nYou\u2019re ungrateful and disrespectful and I\u2019m so sad for your aunt.\n\nAlso what is your mother going to do a speech about? She abandoned you and didn\u2019t prioritize you. You\u2019re making excuses for her bad behaviour but your aunt didn\u2019t have to be there for you but she did and she was younger than your mom. Maybe put yourself in your aunts position and see how it\u2019s a slap in the face to her when her older sister bailed and she looked after you.", "You really are your moms kid to immature to see the reality of your situations your mom dumped you on your aunt and grandma because she didn\u2019t want to raise you but you\u2019re okay with that hopefully you never have kids you and your mom are vile", "I just cant with OP as-well & she\u2019s really pissing me off with her entitlement. Worse was when she said Ellie didnt have to do all that she did for her - errr yes she did because her deadbeat mum was out of the picture\u2026! I wish I could send this post to Ellie so she could see what\u2019s up, but hopefully someone else does!", "She knows because Ellie is her mother and has been all her life.  She knows and that's what's disgusting.", "came here to say just this. How can she say her mom was young when her aunt  was younger and took on more responsibility. It is ridiculous. Like how many young aunts would have stepped up and done any of that over the past 26 years, not very many.", "No you don\u2019t stop lying you\u2019re picking your deadbeat mom over the person that actually raised you", "I agree with these people. The aunt is better off without you. You're a huge AH and acting selfish. You call the aunt entitled but its actually you saying \"she will always come back, especially if I act super needy haha.\" Hopefully she realizes you and your shitty mom aren't worth it anymore.", "Is it possible that you have inherited some of your mom's shitty perspective and behavior? Think carefully about which one of your parents (including your aunt here) that you want to emulate and be like. Is it your shitty, selfish mom? Or is it your aunt? You're at a crossroads here in terms of how you want to behave as an adult moving forward.", "Your attitude is among the absolute worst I\u2019ve seen on this subreddit. Jesus Christ, no wonder why you wanna be with your mom, you\u2019re both selfish and absolutely terrible people to be around!! Your mom also \u201cchose\u201d to not raise you. She \u201cchose\u201d to live childless and left your aunt to raise you. They both made choices. Your aunt prioritized you. Your mom discarded you. You\u2019re choosing the woman who birthed you and decided she wanted out. I can\u2019t begin to even comprehend how much worse of a person you would be if your aunt didn\u2019t raise you. I would be ashamed to know you. \nYTA and I\u2019m so, so, so sorry for your aunt. This is such a slap in the face for her, but of course you\u2019re only thinking \u201ceh, she\u2019ll get over it, when I\u2019m in need of help it\u2019s ok cuz she\u2019ll help me no matter what!!!!\u201d I hope to god she cuts off all contact with you, she loved you and raised you and all you have to show is that you have absolutely no idea how to be grateful for being loved and raised by a family member.", ">but I she always comes back to me if I ask her and act a bit needy haha\n\nWow.  You don't even see how much of a nasty person you are, do you.", "I never understood that \"Redditors live in an island and are cruel to a boot\", until I saw you, I just hope that when you need them again they abandon you like you are doing to her rn.", "So you purposefully use her? I think you know what the answer to your question is. YTA. You want the benefits of her kindness but don't think it's important to pay it back. You're right, it was her choice to raise you and be there for you. It is also her choice to not be there for you when your mom might leave you again. Don't expect her to be there for you if your mom breaks your heart again.", "I hope she doesn\u2019t go to your wedding you clearly don\u2019t appreciate what she did for you and rather he with your deadbeat mom that only cared to have a relationship with you when you turned into a adult", "Yes, that is what parents do. Would you try the same tactics on your mother or do you feel you have to earn her attention by constantly rewarding her for showing up?\n\nYes, Ellie choose to help you that day. You, an adult at college, choose to make that day about yourself rather than manage for once. Hope Ellie realises that you have no love for her and no respect and repays that energy.\n\nShe isn't your minder now or your parent so stop taking advantage of her with puppy dog eyes. Get some self respect."]}
