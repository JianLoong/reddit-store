Don\u2019t try to invalidate her feelings or be too harsh towards her. If you\u2019re willing to include her in your wedding plans you could allow her to give a speech since she practically raised you. If you choose not to, that\u2019s your decision.

You may have been able to put it more gently, but it sounds like you didn't insult your aunt, only that her expectations were too high of you. It's your wedding day, and your mother is available and present. If she hasn't been cruel to you or anyone else in the family to the point that it would be uncomfortable for her to be featured, your aunt shouldn't take issue with it. It is possible for her to share her feelings for you and wish that she could have been more involved while handling her disappointment privately and not trying to guilt trip you. If you want to mend things, you may need to apologize for your tone and tell her you appreciate everything she did for you, but you seem to understand it doesn't mean you owe her anything particular, just your general kindness and words of appreciation.", "NTA - Aunt vs. Mom drama is so crazyyy.
