The next time your mother isn't there for you (and there will be a next time), don't expect your aunt to help you. I hope she slams the door in your face. YTA", "YTA", "Update?", "Yta", "YTA. Your aunt was there to help you become the person you are. Your mom was selfish and left you with other people to raise. I cannot believe you said you \"don't owe Ellie for doing something she didn't have to do\". You are so harsh and mean.", "YTA this same thing happened to my own mom. She raised my cousin till she was 16 and then the moment she reconnected with her mom she did exactly what you did to your aunt. \n\nJust shows you didn\u2019t appreciate all the hard work that your aunt and grandmother put into raising you. Your mom skipped all the hard parts of raising a child and swooped in at the end when you no longer needing \u201craising\u201d. \n\nThen for you to not remember the support they gave you and throwing it back in her face that she isn\u2019t your mother, makes you a massive AH.", "INFO\n\nHow much, exactly, was bio mom \"in and out of\" your life? And by contrast how much, exactly, was aunt \"in and out of your life?\"\n\nYou don't owe that position to anyone, but from your writeup I have to admit it sounds like you're trying to make up for the time your bio mom gave up. She missed events, and those opportunities will never return ...so you may genuinely want her to have this chance. But has she earned it? Will she genuinely be present and there for you in the future?\n\nBiology means nothing, who is the family who loved and supported you. It could be grandma for all I know, maybe even aunt doesn't have claim to this role!", "Why WOULD Aunt Ellie think she could replace your mom?  This is confusing to me.  NTAH.", "Maybe being abandoned by her mom caused OP to lack empathy or something.", "Wow. And that just made me depressed.", "Your mom was replaced the moment she decided she didn\u2019t want to be a mom. You\u2019re not bright, are you?", "Ellie is a way better person than you are. You\u2019re taking her for granted. She wasted her young adulthood helping raise you while your mom bailed and this is what she gets? Ouch.", "No, Ellie won't always be there for you, not after this. And you ARE being mean. You're selfish and nasty. You are your mother's daughter. Both of you are selfish, uncaring assholes.", "> She started going on about how I 'made' her miss her fiance's funeral\n\nwe need this story", "Wow, you suck!", "You\u2019re disgusting. She loves you and you\u2019re taking advantage of her. I hope someone finds this and shows it to her. She\u2019ll never do anything for you again, and Mommy can be your shitty parent. YTA.", "You're the type of person where if I was this aunt. You would be dead to me. Don't talk to me don't even think about me. You're pretty much excommunication. You would be nothing but the whispers of the wind. When your  quote unquote sometimes mom does the same shit different day again don't come crying to your aunt. Hell I hope other family members see how much of a snake you are and don't even want to see you. I even hope the person you are marrying go. In second thought naw we can't marry", "You and your bio mom are both TAH.  She dumped you on her younger sister like unwanted trash.  What would make you stupid enough to honor that?", "Wow. You're an ungrateful asshole. YTA.", "Sorry but 24 isn\u2019t \u201cpretty young\u201d especially when the aunt is younger.", "Gosh your comments in this thread are just so telling. You raise someone and literally don\u2019t get any recognition and then are also taken for granted? Yeah she didn\u2019t have to do what she did but she did unlike some parents until just four years ago. YTA.", "YTA bigtime.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I missed a lot of milestones with my mom \n\nAnd why was that? Because she chose not to be in your life. But who was in your life? Who chose to support you when they could have chosen to dump you in a foster home, --which in hindsight is exactly what you deserve--, your aunt. The apple has truly fallen very close to the tree in your case and that of your mother. I hope your aunt distances herself from you as I am sure that someone as unappreciative as you will bring to er nothing but pain in her old age.", "YTA. It's nice you want to makeup with your bio mom, but you were not raised by her. She has not been with you through every day of school, every milestone, every trouble. That has been your aunt. I would hope that you honor and respect her for how important she has been. \n\nWhen your mom came back you may have had the orphan fantasy that this was all a mistake and now that your real parent is back everything is roses and sunshine. Your bio mom abandoned you. Stop making excuses for her. Come to some level of friendship as peers. But do not look up to her, and do not place her ahead of someone who actually loves you.", "YTA, your poor aunt.  You don't appreciate her at all", "YTA", "OP is so mean. Have you seen their comment about how they can manipulate their aunt back into their life whenever they want? Truly disgusting behavior. Looks the rancid apple doesn't fall far from the rotten tree.", "Not to mention, who is going to be around if OP chooses to have kids? Bio mom has already proved she's going to flake. Aunt, who did all the work of raising OP, would probably have been delighted to be the honorary grandma. OP is robbing herself of a mother figure and her future children of a grandmother. OP, YTA.", "I wonder if there\u2019s actual lingering resentment towards the mother here because what you said got me thinking. During the speech mom is literally going to have nothing to say aside from I abandoned my kid but here\u2019s 4 years of what I know?  Is that what OP wants? An acknowledgment of that abandonment? Usually speeches are made by people who have known the bride and groom all their lives or for a long time. It\u2019s going to be obvious if there\u2019s not much there.", "Well she knows her aunt is going no where that\u2019s what she said in a comment. She\u2019s banking on her aunt just taking it and being needy to win her back lol", "I am feeling sorry for the aunt who step up to take care of a kid whose mom abandoned her. But definitely that is not enough. Now she should prove her love to the kid by not being upset.", "Because mom forgot to perform her motherly duty and the aunt and the grandma took that responsibility.", "Off course she can make any rule she wants.

You can create the rules and give them both a role. I\u2019ve been to a wedding where the biological dad starts walking the bride down the aisle and hands her off to the step dad who takes over to give the bride away. The bio dad wasn\u2019t on the picture until later in life. Same for speeches. Is there a reason why you aunt can\u2019t speak in addition to your mom?

Hope you don\u2019t regret it.", "YTA", "NTA you want what you want and a lot of people will not understand but I do", "Piling on YTA, because it really needs to be driven home. You're right, Ellie didn't have to step up and raise you when your mom failed at the basic duties of parenthood. She could have let you go into foster care. You've shown Ellie how much she matters to you, I hope she learns the lesson and leaves you to figure it out next time bio mom lets you down. You are being willfully obtuse about each woman's contribution to your life. Your bio mom gave birth, whoop de do. Your aunt did the hard work of actual motherhood. You come across as very dismissive and selfish in your post and comments. Apple clearly didn't fall too far from the rotten tree here.", ">I eventually told her I appreciate her, but she's not my mom.\n\nWonder how much pushing she did to force that from you. Ellie should never of assumed your mum or dad would walk you down the isle UNLESS otherwise spoken about. \n\n>I've had a solid relationship with my mom for the past few years and we're close.\n\nEllie would of seen this so unless she's blind it would be more logical to assume what's happening then what Ellie thought in her mind. \n\nI know lots of people give speeches at weddings so what's stopping Ellie, just because she's not \"Mother of the Bride\"", "YTA\n\nYou chose your \"mom\" over your real mom.

You sound like a real peach.", "Why don't you have both of them walk you down the aisle?", "YTA. And incredibly selfish. And entitled. Your Aunt is in fact your Mom. The woman you call Mom is actually your Mother. She may have birthed you but she didn\u2019t raise you. You are completely taking your Aunt for granted and being pretty mean about it. Seems like you have a LOT of growing up to do.", ">Jesus, imagine raising somebody\n\nImagine assuming a role in a wedding without actually talking to the bride \n\n>That's great but you are disrespecting the person who raised you and prioritising the person who abandoned you. \n\nEllie didn't raise OP on her own, grandma was also there and she said her mother was in and out yet still able to form a CLOSE relationship.", ">You absolutely could have found some kind of compromise\n\nNo she couldn't and shouldn't have to.
