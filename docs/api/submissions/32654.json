My family isn\u2019t half as dysfunctional as yours, but shit still plays out and\nYour story reminds me of this. I personally wonder if it\u2019s worth trying to have a relationship with these people, or with this one sister. I personally would have no problem being offered some ashes - indeed, I would expect some - but the fact that your sister considered gifting you them for Christmas speaks volumes as to what sort of clueless/inconsiderate arsehole she is. She handled it badly, you responded in a triggered way - the whole thing is and was a minefield. Is it worth it?", "OP, you are not the problem in this situation. \n\nYour sister is inappropriate and unhinged.\n\nI am sorry you lost your mom so young. Don't feel bad keeping your distance until the mental issues of your siblings have been resolved.\n\nThey seem to have scapegoated you, rather than processed their grief. And you were the youngest. Seriously not OK.\n\nNTA", "Info:\n\nHow did they abandon you but at the same time you seem to have a full on relationship with them? Where does the abandonment come into play?", "NTA But you should, actually, break up with Debbie and any family members that support this bullshit.", "Nope NTA unless there lots of you yelling and being angry you\u2019re leaving out", "It may be helpful to know more about the blaming you for the break up of the family thing and abandonment, at the least to see if this behaviour from Debbie is consistent to how she was back then. That would at least give us a better idea of if it's worth continuing to try to reconcile with the family, given that it appears to be just Debbie right now.\n\nBut from the info given in this post, you're NTA, OP. This was...I don't even have words. Supremely messed up and likely psychotic doesn't really seem to quite cover it. They didn't even consult you about the decision to split your mum's ashes. Some people would find that disrespectful to the dead, preferring something like a memorial with the ashes either scattered or buried. Debbie did, however, consult a work colleague about the Christmas gift idea, and when told that would be a very bad idea, she then decided to make the whole thing a worse idea by telling you she was going to give you the ashes in a plastic baggy! \n\nMy advice is to wait until you've got your share of your mum's ashes, then go NC again. Maybe create a nice little memorial of your own for your mum somewhere she would have liked and you can visit. Or get a beautiful container to keep the ashes in. Whatever feels right to you to remember and honour your mum.", "This story makes zero sense. Why would your adult sisters blame you for your mother's death when you were 15?

Are they consistently unkind to you or did this come out if the blue?", "NTA\u2026but I am sorry to say this, you get one life.
