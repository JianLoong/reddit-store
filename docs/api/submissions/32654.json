This was...I don't even have words. Supremely messed up and likely psychotic doesn't really seem to quite cover it. They didn't even consult you about the decision to split your mum's ashes. Some people would find that disrespectful to the dead, preferring something like a memorial with the ashes either scattered or buried. Debbie did, however, consult a work colleague about the Christmas gift idea, and when told that would be a very bad idea, she then decided to make the whole thing a worse idea by telling you she was going to give you the ashes in a plastic baggy! \n\nMy advice is to wait until you've got your share of your mum's ashes, then go NC again. Maybe create a nice little memorial of your own for your mum somewhere she would have liked and you can visit. Or get a beautiful container to keep the ashes in.

Do you constantly trauma dump on them? Are you in therapy? How/why are you blamed for \"the breakup of the family\", especially if you were 15? There is way too much missing information to properly judge this.\n\nDo you know that ashes come in a plastic bag from the crematoriums? Yeah, most funeral homes also sell you some sort of vessel, but the ashes always come in a plastic bag inside the vessel. I agree she could have gone to more effort to find a nice container for you, but she genuinely might have thought she was doing the nice and proper thing by offering you some of your mothers ashes. I have cousins that split ashes of loved ones and put it in jewelry and crystals and various items, and sometimes baggies are used because they want to find their own vessels.

It looks like you then started asking questions and wouldn't stop when your sister didn't want to continue. Again, not enough info. You could be the asshole for not respecting that she needed the conversation to be over after she repeatedly said she was leaving, so she might have felt that driving away was the only escape she had. She might be the asshole for her delivery. Either way, that doesn't make it her job to support you emotionally just because you didn't take it well. She can't process for you and she doesn't have to be involved in that. If she made it clear she didn't want to be involved, and you tried to force the issue, not cool Op.\n\nIdk, I see too much here that really makes me question your behavior, Op. Sister might be an aggressive asshole, or she might just be done with your bullshit. There are sooooo many missing missing reasons here.", "INFO for missing information.\n\nThere are comments about the deleted text message screenshots you provided in the deleted post. A commenter with both high and low upvoted comments says that your sister told you commit suicide through text, there was a fight in text messages, and the commenter, not me, states that your sister texted you that she didn't want you to continue the text conversation but you still continued to do so. Again, the commenter, not me, says you needlessly antagonized your sister and that you and your sister both have a toxic relationship.\n\nCan you clarify the nature of the texts?\n\nThere's no clear timeline. If your sister told you to commit suicide in the past and the Christmas gift incident is new- this would be Y T A or E S H depending on the specifics. \nThe little information you've given sounds like your family and your sister are bad people. More specifically, it sounds like you've always had a bad and even toxic relationship with her.\n\nYour feelings matter, but, if this a repeat situation- then your feelings don't mean a thing. They don't mean a thing because no one cares about them. Your sister wouldn't be worth the energy to communicate your feelings because she has never cared. A sibling who tells another sibling to commit suicide is a vile bully who doesn't care about that sibling.\n\nIt doesn't matter if this is a repeat situation because you need therapy to find out why you're having a relationship with a family that seems to hate you. They've always seemed to hate you. If they only hate you, then expecting them to act like normal people will only ever disappoint you because your family is abnormal.
