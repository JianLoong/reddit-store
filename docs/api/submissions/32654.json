I had a Dad and 3 sisters, 9, 12 and 15 years older than me. They abandoned me, convinced me I was the problem, and blame me for the break up of the family.\n\nOne sister, Debbie, decided with two other sisters to divide mum's ashes into 4 last weekend, since they had been sitting in a temporary urn in a garage for 25 years. Four days later, Debbie and I spend 3 hours together having brunch a swim and a chill at home. Once she was ready to leave, car running, everything packed away, she approached me and said she was going to give me some of Mum's ashes as a Christmas present, but she ran through the idea with her work colleagues and was told it was a terrible idea and extremely fucked up. So instead she told me she would give me 1/4 of Mum's ashes in a plastic baggie instead. She then jumped in the car and drove away.\n\nI called Debbie later that night and expressed I was hurt she brought this up at the time she did, and that I had no opportunity to respond or process this information before heading back to work. She responded aggressively, telling me I should be thankful for her thoughtful gesture, labelling me as \"a victim\" and \"abusive\" for sharing my feelings about the situation. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for communicating my hurt and disappointment? How would you react?\n\nEXTRA INFO -----------\nFair warning: if you thought the ashes story was fake, take a deep breath and read on...\n\nWhy am I blamed for breaking up the family: Dad had a new girlfriend immediately after Mum died of a brain tumour, she was sick for just under one year. He would leave me at home for days alone, but tell me he would be popping out for some milk and to expect him back soon.\n\nEven though I had sisters in their 20s and 30s who were stable and had their own homes, they were not around. They didn't call, we didn't have a relationship. I was sent to live with my 5 cousins in a toxic-religious family with an alcoholic uncle. Our extended family lived in the same city, and every year it was expected we attend family gatherings during holidays, even after Mum died. Even though toxic things happened, our cousin's, aunts, and uncles continued to meet annually. There have been years where every single one of my sister's has been NC with another, or with Dad. It constantly changes.\n\nAfter a number of years, I started to see what had happened with our family after Mum died was not normal. I was constantly putting everyone else before me, above me. There was nothing too big to ask of me. I told myself I was wrong in every scenario because that was easier than trying to prove my case, and getting berated for it. I tried to minimise my feelings as much as possible, because any feelings or emotions I showed, my eldest sister labelled as me being 'difficult' or 'abusive', even when I wasn't.\n\nWhen I started standing up for myself and asserting my boundaries, my world crumbled. I couldn't say to any sister: 'what you did was hurtful' because they hear 'you are a psychopath and everything about you is wrong'. It is though they cannot separate self from behaviour. I have been relentlessly attacked over the past 2 years in particular, for calling out mistreatment and labelling their behaviour. I am now the common enemy.\n\nI began therapy and have had the same psychologist for four years. Said psychologist has met the sister who gifted me the ashes and has repeatedly warned me against maintaining contact with my family. I hear this echoed in the comments. I want to say, it is not easy believing in yourself when you have grown up in my family, and especially so when everyone is 10 years older. It has taken me YEARS so understand how toxic it has been, and to be honest, I still don't think I totally get it. I've wanted to make it work, to be a part of my family, to just be civil. \n\nEXTRA INFO:\nFair warning: if you thought the ashes story was fake, take a deep breath and read on...\n\nWhy am I blamed for breaking up the family: Dad had a new girlfriend immediately after Mum died of a brain tumour, she was sick for just under one year.

Some people would find that disrespectful to the dead, preferring something like a memorial with the ashes either scattered or buried. Debbie did, however, consult a work colleague about the Christmas gift idea, and when told that would be a very bad idea, she then decided to make the whole thing a worse idea by telling you she was going to give you the ashes in a plastic baggy! \n\nMy advice is to wait until you've got your share of your mum's ashes, then go NC again.

Yeah, most funeral homes also sell you some sort of vessel, but the ashes always come in a plastic bag inside the vessel.

You could be the asshole for not respecting that she needed the conversation to be over after she repeatedly said she was leaving, so she might have felt that driving away was the only escape she had. She might be the asshole for her delivery. Either way, that doesn't make it her job to support you emotionally just because you didn't take it well. She can't process for you and she doesn't have to be involved in that. If she made it clear she didn't want to be involved, and you tried to force the issue, not cool Op.\n\nIdk, I see too much here that really makes me question your behavior, Op.

A commenter with both high and low upvoted comments says that your sister told you commit suicide through text, there was a fight in text messages, and the commenter, not me, states that your sister texted you that she didn't want you to continue the text conversation but you still continued to do so. Again, the commenter, not me, says you needlessly antagonized your sister and that you and your sister both have a toxic relationship.\n\nCan you clarify the nature of the texts?\n\nThere's no clear timeline. If your sister told you to commit suicide in the past and the Christmas gift incident is new- this would be Y T A or E S H depending on the specifics. \nThe little information you've given sounds like your family and your sister are bad people. More specifically, it sounds like you've always had a bad and even toxic relationship with her.\n\nYour feelings matter, but, if this a repeat situation- then your feelings don't mean a thing. They don't mean a thing because no one cares about them. Your sister wouldn't be worth the energy to communicate your feelings because she has never cared. A sibling who tells another sibling to commit suicide is a vile bully who doesn't care about that sibling.\n\nIt doesn't matter if this is a repeat situation because you need therapy to find out why you're having a relationship with a family that seems to hate you. They've always seemed to hate you. If they only hate you, then expecting them to act like normal people will only ever disappoint you because your family is abnormal.

She just doesn't care about the feelings of others. \r  \n\\- Very black and white thinking so she or others are either good or bad, no nuances, and she can't imagine other people judging her with more nuance than which she judges people with.\r  \n\\- Because of her lack of empathy she can't predict that others (such as your sister's colleagues) would find her plans fucked up and that sharing ideas like these will ostracise her. \r  \n\\- But she can recognise it when a majority of people is strongly rejecting her ideas. (It doesn't take much empathy to understand the whole office telling you that your idea is bonkers might make you seem like the baddie. So she readjusts her plans, not because she understands, empathises or cares about you, but to safe face, while still not understanding why she's 'wrong' and thus still not being able to adjust accordingly.\r  \n\\- So now she comes up with a still absurd solution or compromise and expects other people to commend her for such -in her eyes- kind gesture.\r  \n\\- When confronted with negative feedback (even when it's only addressing how it made you feel without passing judgement about her actions) it clashes with her idea of kindness and since things are black and white, either she is right or you are right. In her world there is no such thing as 'I tried my best, but still misjudged and my actions caused another grief. Without taking blame or putting blame on the other I want to know what the other person's thought processes and feelings are so we can both learn from this.'\r  \nAnd since she was the kind one in her mind, you must be the bad one.\r  \n\\- Since you are now the bad one, that must entail that all your actions are bad (black and white thinking). So you expressing feelings, is now interpreted as you manipulating her with your feelings. You setting a boundary to protect your own mental health, is now in her mind you punishing her or getting back at her.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nIf someone had told me that this story was about my mother, I would not bat an eye, just another Monday. My sisters and I have a long list of weird anecdotes that we didn't realise how extremely unhinged they were, because we got so used to it as children. Still, when memories pop up that felt just uncomfortable at the time, I have moments of clarity where I can see now how extreme it was. Because it was so normalised, I knew it was not okay, but not how extremely not okay it was. \r  \nThat's what I read between the lines in your post as well.\r  \n\r  \nI still have people giving me shocked reactions sometimes when I share something that was an unpleasant experience with my mom, and people then tell me how brave I am and praise how calm I stayed in those situations or while recalling them. But honestly, I just don't fully register how disturbing these moments were. I'm so used to my feelings about them being minimised by my mom, but also other people that didn't want to disturb the so called 'peace' and knew that to do that they had to shut me up, because shutting my mom up was not a possibility. That made me internalise those minimisations. \r  \nI read the same in your story with your sister.\r  \n\r  \nAnother common ground is the reactions that you get here in response to your anecdote. 'It is such a weird and unhinged anecdote and therefore OP must be lying.' And even when provided proof 'it still can not be totally true, it must be exaggerated or at least OP is leaving out valuable information'. \r  \nI went through the same and it made me hide things. I would not discuss it with other adults or friends when my mom did things like these or I would even make up excuses for her. I was never trusted to speak the truth when I did, even though I always downplayed the actual situation in my mothers favour. Apart from that people saw me as honest to a fault, so it was not about not being trustworthy.\r  \nI cried tears of relieve in the middle of my chemistry class when a classmate told about a similar dynamic in her mum and had similar stories. After 17 years there was finally someone that understood this weird alternative reality that I was living in with my mother.\r  \n\r  \nI'm not saying that therefore your sister must having BPD as well, but I strongly advise you to look up good information about it.\r  \nIf it doesn't seem to fit, I would look up information about other personality disorders, especially one's in which lack of empathy is an important symptom, like narcissistic personality disorder.  /r/raisedbynarcissists has a world of valuable information.\r  \nBecause people have very exaggerated ideas about personality disorders, many people, including health professionals, don't recognise them.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThis is a whole wall of text, but I hope it can help you somewhat. Because I know I needed loads of help untangling my family dynamics. And psychologists that didn't understand Type-B personality disorders, made it so much worse and prolonged my suffering by more than a decade. I never came across someone that is able to understand it without having lived through it. For most people some form of sympathy is such an integral part of how they experience and view the world, that they cannot fathom how someone without it acts and thinks and no psychology text books change that.\r  \n\r  \nUnderstanding personality disorders and my family dynamics was not just 'interesting' like genealogy. But it was one of the biggest turning points in my mental health, because I came to understand that everything I heard about myself was just not true. I was not difficult or overly sensitive. I had valid feelings in an extreme situation and developed coping mechanisms. It made me realise it was not me being unworthy of love or attention, but my parents by design being unable to give it too me and being egocentric about their wants and needs. I understood that the loyalty I was feeling was a trauma bond and that my sisters being on and off in no contact with me or my parents (as you also describe) was part of the enmeshment dynamics. \r  \nYou didn't write much about your parents behaviour, but it might be interesting to look at that as well. BPD & NPD have a high genetic component. And, just as with your sister, I'm not saying your father has BPD or NPD, but leaving your young child behind to pursue a new love so soon after your mother's death, leaving for days without arranging supervision or even communicating about his plans and sticking to them, seems to me to go beyond unhealthy coping mechanisms for the premature loss of your spouse. People with BPD/NPD often have very quickly, very intense romantic relationships, that serve more as a way of escaping/regulating than as an actual partnership. The pattern of being hyperfocused on pursuing someone and neglecting pre-existing responsibilties is very common in these disorders. People with BPD/NPD need something external to regulate their emotions and find validation and one of those forms is romance and/or sex.\r  \nBPD & NPD often also attract each other, and I believe that relationships with people with ADHD are also more common, if I'm not mistaken.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI cannot recommend looking up 'flying monkeys' and 'narcissistic family dynamics' enough, if you recognise yourself in my stories. I especially like innerintegration on YT about this.\r  \nI wish for you to untangle that web as well, so you can create more space in your head for yourself instead of the confusion.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nNot only would it give you a lot of information about the dynamics that you grew up in, but also the dynamics your elder sisters grew up in. The abandonment that you describe might at it's core have very complex reasons. It could open up a conversation between you, if wanted, and might even change your relationships with each other now.", "This is just questionable. Your siblings split the ashes in fours (1/4s) to include you. You\u2019re pissed because got yours? The fact that your edit is FAR longer than the initial post is fucking weird.

Why are people being weird and hyper sensitive about just speaking your truth. It\u2019s weird. ESH keep your boundaries and block the toxic shit out.", "Beautiful. Thank you for reminding me to continue to show kindness but not weakness \u2764\ufe0f", "I was the elderst at home (my sisters 4&5 years younger) and when I was in my early 20's I needed to 'abandon' them for the sake of my mental health. I found it horrible, the guilt was... the guilt is still enough for me to tear up now I'm writing this 15 years later. I had always tried to protect them, give them the compassion and validation my parents never gave them. But I couldn't do it any longer. I was depressed and the dynamic was so toxic for me that I constantly felt as if I was barely keeping my head above the water. I was lucky enough to have a psychotherapist at the time that recognised the unhealthy enmeshment and responsibility I felt towards my sisters and worked with me on letting go. \r  \nThere were times that my body just said 'no'. I could not bring myself to be in that dynamic anymore. Just like when you have the flu and you feel like your body just refuses to go on. Sure you can push yourself to run a marathon in that state, but there's also something very visceral telling you not to. \r  \nI suspect you know what I mean, since you've come to the point where you want to assert yourself more. I suspect you're starting to feel those 'no's' in your body, that motivated you to set boundaries where you didn't before.\r  \n\r  \nHowever horrible it was for my sisters, breaking out of the enmeshment was an essential condition to heal. My sisters weren't aware of the toxicity at that time (I was barely aware), and yes, they have told me it felt like I abandoned them, and I those feelings are 100% valid. But I never meant to leave them behind, I was only surviving.\r  \nMaybe you and your sisters are very different. And maybe they were just surviving as well. Or not able to support you during grieving the passing of their mother. It can be so healing, if possible in a healthy way, to talk about things like this with each other so you know what was going on inside each others heads. \r  \nI know for me, that even though hearing my sisters say it confirmed one of my biggest fears, it gave me the opportunity to assure them that I never ever wanted to leave them behind. That it was not about wanting, that it was very hard on me, and that I never ever wanted them to experience feeling abandoned, but that I was not mentally stable enough to take them in at that time and did what I could. We cried over it together, we cried over the fucked upness of the situation. And it was good. It relieved some of the pain and brought more understanding for each other. And a part will probably never heal, not for them, not for me.\r  \nWhere they have the abandonment trauma to bear, I have to bear other trauma's they never got to experience in our family, like being a single child for 5 years by very stressed and dis-regulated parents that have to transition to the responsibilities of having a child (which is extremely upsetting if you are very egocentric) and I being the one it was taken out on because I was the clear cause (which persisted after my sisters were born, anything was my fault). It's not a trauma competition, but it does help to see the crosses we all bear to feel less isolated. \r  \n\r  \nAnyways, I hope some of this information is valuable for you. I hope it's not too much or invading on your personal space. But I know how long it took me to see and then also dare to believe what was going on. And that's normal. If you truly encountered BPD/NPD or other personality disorders in your family, there is a big change that you were conditioned from early on, that they were normal and that you were wrong. And that it was unsafe to listen to that gut feeling that told you something different. Because if you would express that, you would be chastised. So we stop trusting that voice to survive.\r  \n\r  \nBut you are right. This is not normal behaviour of your sister. It's not even just weird behaviour. It's pathological. \r  \nAnd if you have a hard time believing that, I would take it to your therapist. And also discuss the possibility of personality disorders being present and ask her if she has good information on it. She knows best where you are in your process and what information might be suitable and beneficial right now.\r  \n\r  \nO, and one important last remark: if you do look up BDP/NPD and recognise traits and behaviours in yourself, don't automatically assume you have this disorder as well. It could be the case, but it might not. If you grow up surrounded by NPD/BPD, you can learn some of these behaviours without developing the disorder itself (the term 'narcissistic fleas' is also used for this in regard to NPD). A personality disorder is basically a disorder that is so ingrained in your personality that you can't differentiate the personality from the disorder. People with personality disorders answer when asked about behaviour for example often with things as 'that's just how I've always been', 'that's just how it is'. Self awareness and introspection is lacking for the most part, depending on severity of the disorder and perceived stress in the moment. \r  \nThinking 'o fuck, I have that behaviour too and don't like that about myself, because I don't want to impact others negatively, but I also don't know how to change it', is typically not something someone with a(n untreated) personality disorder would think.\r  \nThe toxic behaviour is of course, also when learned, something you'd want to unlearn. Therapy can help with that.\r  \n\r  \nI doubt that your sister is able to successfully unlearn this behaviour, though, based on the severe lack of sympathy and empathy displayed, even after feedback of her colleagues and then later not responding with empathy on your feedback. Wanting to do better by yourself or others is a big motivational drive to change, if that's lacking because you lack the empathy to see how your behaviour impacts others and how you are hurting also yourself by that, it is very hard to consistently put the effort in that's needed for such a big change in behaviour. Plus if you cannot put yourself in someone else's shoes, it's also near impossible to understand that others do have empathy and how that makes them see and experience things differently. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI wish you the best in your mental health journey and re-trusting that inner compass.", "Did I get 1/4 of the ashes?
