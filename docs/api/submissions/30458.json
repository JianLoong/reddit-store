We share a daughter. Casey(12f).  In 7 years, he's remarried, divorced, dated and almost married for a third time. \n\nAfter the last breakup with his fiance (who Casey was close to and I really liked because she was really good to Casey after coming from an awful stepmother) he stopped coming around. He made excuses not to get her on his time and often stated he needed to be alone. So Casey and I let it go. She has always been with me and where I go, she goes. \n\nCasey's birthday is coming up and we scheduled her party this past weekend. In an effort to bring them together, I invited her dad, his new gf and the gf's son. My ex agreed to come and I sent him the invitation. \n\nI also reminded him about the party twice two weeks prior and then three times the week before. I sent him messages and reminded him verbally. I didn't think I needed to call and remind him the day of because he tells me that he doesn't need to be reminded since  he isn't a child (because I used to remind him about her games). \n\nThe day of the party, I'm running around decorating, cleaning, getting food, blowing up balloons, prepping the house for her friends, followed by a slumber party after. \n\nThe party started at 5. At 5:30, Casey asked where her dad was. So I called. He was at his girlfriends house about 90 minutes away. He proceeded to yell at me for waiting until 30 min after the party started to call and remind him.  He said he couldn't come because he was too far away. \n\nOk, your loss. I hung up. \n\nThe party went great. Casey was thrilled and I was a tired but happy mama too. \n\nThis morning, my ex calls and begins to berate me telling me that he was upset with me that I didn't call and remind him and that missing her party was my fault because \"in business they always call to confirm attendance\".\n\nI told him that I shouldn't have to call and remind a 40 year old man about his daughter's birthday party. And he said I was personally attacking him.I told him I sent him the invitation and that it wasn't my responsibility to make sure he set a reminder in his phone.  I told him it was OK that he forgot and messed up but he needed to own it and not blame me for his mess up. I told him that this was super narcissistic behavior and that he needed to take responsibility. He called me gross for using words that I didn't know and being my petty Betty self, I replied, \"After being married to you, I'm fully aware of what a narcissist and gas lighting is.\" \n\nHe hung up and then texted to say he wouldn't talk to me if I continued to use personal attacks. He also stated he wouldn't be paying the agreed half of the expenses because I didn't remind him and he didn't come to the party. Its not even about the money. \n\nI don't think it was a personal attack to state that its not my job to remind him.
