What you should be doing is discussing these things with your daughter, fostering open communication because you WANT HER to come to you when she does something stupid when she is 14, 15, 16, 17 etc\n\nIf you push more control, she will start hiding things and wont come to you when she may be having serious issues.\n\nRe depressing posts in nature, you can take time out of your day to talk about that stuff to your daughter, hell, encourage her to have own voice and opinion on things, teach her that following the crowd isnt always a way, that she needs to also figure out for herself the right and wrong and help her navigate the right and wrong.\n\nWhat you need to be doing is preparing her for this shitty harsh world, but no longer shielding and hiding her away. How will she cope once shes an adult otherwise?\n\nAs to the troubled 13year old, you have no inkling on just HOW MUCH a positive influence of another adult can make in her life as she matures. While some deeds might not be valued right now, when shes older, they will make a world of difference. Shes a child. Just because she has issues and perhaps issues at home, IS NOT OK to receive more judgement and scorn from shitty adults.

She may be a bit of an unruly one with her answering back to teachers but everything else is perfectly normal.\n\nYour daughter is 12. She swears. I guarantee it.

Your daughter will be surrounded by these things, unless you want her to be lonely you need to accept that she's almost a teenager and she will be exposed to stuff like this now. You can teach her to handle things sensibly but by trying to shield her from reality you will do her a disservice and alienate her.", "From the Information you've gathered they just seem to post edgy 13 year old things.

In your first sentence you only mention the things that she does wrong in your mind, but do you actually give her credit for helping your daughter settle in?\n\nThird: It is valid to be concerned about the people your children hang out with, for sure.

Very religious family, super strict, his mom vetted all his friends, he couldn\u2019t swear or play video games or really do anything. Taught to repress everything.

Talk to her about the specific concerns - disrespecting teachers, language, etc - and affirm your trust in her in making the right choice.

The clich\u00e9 \"nobody understands me!\" is a pretty universal experience for teenagers. \n\nYou probably view you daughter as a child, but seem to overlook that many girls get their first period at 12 or even earlier, that she may have been playing with dolls last week, but is interested in boys and makeup today. You can't stop her growing up, but you can help her navigate this time of her life. \n\nOuteight forbidding a friendship that so far has done no harm you can name is probably not a good approach, it doesn't seem reasonable to people your age and it certainly will not to a 7th grader. \n\nGaming isn't inherently bad. It can actually train some skills, depending on genre. Stop demonizing it, read about it with an open mind. \n\nDepression is very common in teenagers, help your daugter understand and navigate negative feelings instead of judging a child for having them. \n\nSwearing may be rude, but it is and always has been a way to rebel in a harmless way. To be honest: As long as people understand that you can't swear at strangers, teachers or at your workplace, I don't see a problem with it.\n\nYou mentiond pictures of self harm and that's another thing you can help your child understand and navigate: Why do people do that to themselves? What can be done about it? What should she do, if she feels the urge?\n\n>I have seen her talk back to teachers in more than one occasion in online meetings, posts depressing, mature things on Instagram, swears, games all the time, and is generally a bad influence.\n\nReading just that paragraph, it can probably all be chucked up to teenagers being teenagers.\n\nBUT You titled this AITA for JUDGING a 13 year old and that alone makes you the asshole. We don't see, what she posts and how far she goes with it and the fact she was welcoming your daughter probably means, she is doing ok...but all of that could also point to some serious issues at home. If she oversexualizes, actually self harms, actually shows signs of depression, how is your first impuls to judge and not to make sure she is ok?\n\nAnd then I remember you saying in a comment how religion is \"proper stuff\" and I can't help but think that people declaring themselves as \"compassionate christians\" often find themselves only compassionate with people who are like them.\n\nYTA", "YTA - Do you remember being 12?

The girl you're describing was my best friend in school. She was mouthy and too smart for her age, and she protected me from bullies and stood up for me when I was too shy to do it myself.

My daughter had a friend like that, too, but she also had a boyfriend like that and he was simply awful. I like the new guy a lot better.   \n\n\nThis part of parenting is truly terrifying. You have to let your children make their own friends, and you have to watch them make mistakes. You have to stay out of their business, and you have to respect their privacy. The next five years determine whether you have a strong bond with your child or they go no contact with you the second they turn 18.   \n\n\nIt's okay not to like her friends, but if you want her to talk about her life with you, you have to respect her choices. You're probably not going to like her boyfriend either. But you're going to have to let her make mistakes now while you're still available to help pick up the pieces and clean up the mess. Don't let her wait until she goes off to college with zero experience in personal relationships. That's a recipe for disaster. Let her learn and be a good mentor.   \n\n\nYou've been a good parent up to now. She's a good kid. Trust the foundation you laid, and trust your child.

I also read, studied hard, and stood up for other people who got bullied instead of keeping my head down and trying to deflect the bullying that was already coming my way onto others for a peaceful life.\n\nThis is the kind of girl you WANT on your daughter's team. someone who isn't afraid to challenge what they feel isn't right and will fight for what IS. \n\nGo look at yourself, because your bully mentality is likely to ostracise your child and she won't have friendships at all.

You have to be smarter than that. Talk to her, ask about what they do together, etc. If you raised your daughter right and that other kid truly is bad news, she will eventually see it on her own.

You can try to reduce contact by simply not allowing specific outings and such but you must be clear that if your kid wants this girl as a friend badly you can't prevent it (not with normal measures) completely.", "NTA - you\u2019re concerned. That doesn\u2019t make you an asshole. But sheltering and forbidding your daughter to hang out with someone isn\u2019t the best course of action imo. It\u2019ll likely backfire and as others have said, your daughter will likely only hang out with this girl and do these things but hide them from you. \n\nYour role is not to shelter your daughter from this but rather prepare her to encounter and manage these things. But you are also her parent and your daughter and this girl are still children. I don\u2019t agree with people who say to go ahead and let your child hang out with her. Their thinking is that she will learn to manage difficult situations by being exposed to those difficult situations. That is misguided. Children can\u2019t learn how to manage big emotions on their own. They need adults to show how to manage all that big stuff in a healthy, mature, responsible way. Immature children cannot teach other children to be mature. They can only teach them to continue being immature. \n\nSo rather than forbidding your daughter to see this girl, your best course of action is to invite this girl yourself to hang out with your daughter with some supervision. Not watching their every move. But invite this girl to your house. \n\nYour concerns are totally valid. Your daughter just moved schools so she is emotionally vulnerable because she is looking for friends and companionship. She could be very easily susceptible to peer pressure. But you have judged this girl perhaps unfairly. You don\u2019t really know at this point. You might be correct and this girl is a mean girl leader who has taken an interest in your daughter because she enjoys causing trouble and sees the vulnerable situation in your daughter and can manipulate her to feel a sense of power. Or she might be a troubled young girl who could also use a friend and maybe just a bit more care and guidance from an adult and could feel empowered by befriending another girl who is in a vulnerable situation. At this point no one has any idea which scenario is more likely. Your best bet is to let them be friends but on your terms. Spend time with both of them. Do things with both of them. Don\u2019t involve yourself too much, but do things for this other girl as well so that maybe she sees you as someone who cares and not just another adult trying to control her", "Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer!", "NTA", "NTA, you want what\u2019s best for your children but you have addressed concerns and unfortunately cannot be there to make every decision for them. At some point they are going to hang around or be In The company of people you don\u2019t like, and may in the end not be good for them, but you can\u2019t dictate that, they need to learn and you can be there to support but not judge along the way", "NTA, the main problem is that your daughter \u201cidolizes\u201d the girl, and this is coming from a teenager. \n\nI get you don\u2019t know what kind of upbringing this girl has so you feel bad but when it comes to who your daughter hangs around I think you should have some kind of say. Obviously you shouldn\u2019t be safeguarding her from every single person but it is true when people say \u201cyou are who you hang around\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s not good that your daughter puts this girl on a pedestal because she might start acting like her. Which could be talking about the same depressive subjects, talking back for fun, and other bad influence stuff. Especially if your daughter hasn\u2019t been exposed to this behavior before. I know for a fact and have seen it with many of my friends that you fall into a group with a certain person or two and you will change .\n\nSure you don\u2019t want to limit her from making her own friends, but if I\u2019m going to be honest, if it\u2019s that bad you can. It\u2019s your daughter, you shouldn\u2019t control her but atleast TRY to steer her in the right direction. And honestly this could be in having talks with her telling her that boosts her self esteem regarding her personality, her style, her looks because that might be what\u2019s causing her to \u201cidolize\u201d someone else. If you do let them hang out, have it be at your house or you driving them places most of the time (nothing too overbearing, because it\u2019ll cause rebellion) . Look for any changes in the long run that can be bad. Be more caring towards your daughter. You reaffirming a healthy home life will reflect what boundaries she sets within her own life.\n\n\nPotentially you telling her not to hang with this person might cause her to want to more, to rebel so be careful in how strong you come off! Especially at this young teenage stage where kids want to start being their own person. And the reasoning you give her to should also be mindful. If you\u2019re straight telling her \u201cthis girl is a bad influence\u201d and your daughter obviously wants to make her feel welcomed. That might cause her to want to see the light in her (which she might have if you\u2019re just over analyzing) and want your daughter to hang out with her more.\n\nI really don\u2019t see how people are saying YTA. This is a very strong concern when it comes to teenagers and how they get influenced. Should you be an overbearing, controlling mom ( telling her exactly who she can and cannot hang out with) , no. But should you let anyone hang out with your kids especially when you see the kind of influence they could bring, clearly not. \n\nEven try asking your daughter very smoothly why she likes the girl so much, could be because she\u2019s new to her, or she wants to be like her . The \u201cidolizing\u201d is a very important part!!!\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "NTA, shes a bad influence, I've seen such cases before and trust me it will have a huge impact on their personalities for their life, I highly recommend changing schools before she's influenced badly, it can cause irrepairable damage to your daughter's personality.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But one girl was kind to me, she would stick up for me when others would call me names, and she would invite me to do activities that I hadn\u2019t done before because no one wanted to be friends with the black kid.

They don\u2019t have to be \u201cthemselves\u201d work together for a common goal Heck you even have math involved. They had an issue with one kid he sat out got some extra help she asked the group and 100% they had discussed it between them already which whe didn\u2019t know and they wanted the kid back. Part of therapy is choosing your character arc and she is the game master. I was thinking I would love to do that and I am 54 yo. I have been looking for something for my youngest. who is 15 yo. I would love for her to have a real life friend like this. She has 3 other siblings she learned to curse and talk back early. Now I deserve it I am glad I am still alive they way I talked back to my parents and rolled my eyes. Every kid in middle school or some high school makes gender a big thing. My youngest is now a boy named Michael who dresses like a girl. I mean I think back to rebel day sneaking frosted blue eye shadow and black eye liner all around my eyes. I was naive and a \u201cgood girl\u201d. I became a nurse and trust me I see plenty of pregnant teens. If they are online gaming at least they aren\u2019t getting pregnant. The ones that are trickly are the smart ones with good grades poplular and come from some money and nice family. They have the money for drugs and alcohol. They do a whole lot more than you think. I have a friend and a while back her daughter got dumped from her friend group but she didn\u2019t do that and it really hurt. On paper they were super great kids, into clubs and all A\u2019s but they also had a lot of issues. Marching Band was good for my oldest. It is a hard thing get to the kid I talked to them like they were my own about everything if I was talking to mine. They for sure heard my sex and drugs lectures. My kids hated it but I probably traumatized them at first about STD\u2019s pictures I showed. I mean I had a lot of girls 15 yo giving birth. Some at 12 or 13 were SA but some weren\u2019t. My nieces had kids getting caught in the stairwell having sex. When you want acceptance and people to like you those gamer kids, they may talk back and curse but most are pretty good. They don\u2019t party much or hook up I just would yell language when it got out of hand. They curse at me I used it one them. They were like you cursed, yes I did and I meant it. Doesn\u2019t sound great does it. That\u2019s why I told you to stop. One of my girls said she was a lesbian forever I am like okay but friends coming over girlfriends like ones you date can\u2019t spend the night. The good thing is I didn\u2019t have to worry about pregnancy. She changed her mind after high school when this girl became interested in her. She really hated it if I asked did she like her as girlfriend when she mentioned a girl she was hanging out with. I was like I am trying to be supportive. If it was a boy I would ask about it. I just went with it. I might not agree but ultimately I want I a happy well rounded relationship for my kids and as long as their partner has a good job and education and treats them well. I will accept it and goodness knows their are plenty of sinners for worse that preach the Bible yet are very evil people who get caught often way to late.

But she doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, has been with her partner for 2 years, graduated HS early...and this was after a really tough, undiagnosed childhood, and an early teenage life of being taken advantage of by people who knew she would choose kindness first.

I don't think for one minute that secular-run orphanages and boarding schools of the past generations were, on the whole, more likely to be safe than Catholic ones.
