What you should be doing is discussing these things with your daughter, fostering open communication because you WANT HER to come to you when she does something stupid when she is 14, 15, 16, 17 etc\n\nIf you push more control, she will start hiding things and wont come to you when she may be having serious issues.\n\nRe depressing posts in nature, you can take time out of your day to talk about that stuff to your daughter, hell, encourage her to have own voice and opinion on things, teach her that following the crowd isnt always a way, that she needs to also figure out for herself the right and wrong and help her navigate the right and wrong.\n\nWhat you need to be doing is preparing her for this shitty harsh world, but no longer shielding and hiding her away. How will she cope once shes an adult otherwise?\n\nAs to the troubled 13year old, you have no inkling on just HOW MUCH a positive influence of another adult can make in her life as she matures. While some deeds might not be valued right now, when shes older, they will make a world of difference. Shes a child. Just because she has issues and perhaps issues at home, IS NOT OK to receive more judgement and scorn from shitty adults. Who knows, maybe a friendship with your daughter will be a two time benefit, for both to grow.", "INFO.

She may be a bit of an unruly one with her answering back to teachers but everything else is perfectly normal.\n\nYour daughter is 12. She swears. I guarantee it.

I can assure you that the things you mentioned are very normal for 13 year olds, not ideal of course but normal. Your daughter will be surrounded by these things, unless you want her to be lonely you need to accept that she's almost a teenager and she will be exposed to stuff like this now. You can teach her to handle things sensibly but by trying to shield her from reality you will do her a disservice and alienate her.", "From the Information you've gathered they just seem to post edgy 13 year old things.

In your first sentence you only mention the things that she does wrong in your mind, but do you actually give her credit for helping your daughter settle in?\n\nThird: It is valid to be concerned about the people your children hang out with, for sure.

Very religious family, super strict, his mom vetted all his friends, he couldn\u2019t swear or play video games or really do anything. Taught to repress everything.

You may be surprised that you have nothing to be concerned about, or maybe you and your daughter can be a positive influence on her life.

Talk to her about the specific concerns - disrespecting teachers, language, etc - and affirm your trust in her in making the right choice.

The clich\u00e9 \"nobody understands me!\" is a pretty universal experience for teenagers. \n\nYou probably view you daughter as a child, but seem to overlook that many girls get their first period at 12 or even earlier, that she may have been playing with dolls last week, but is interested in boys and makeup today. You can't stop her growing up, but you can help her navigate this time of her life. \n\nOuteight forbidding a friendship that so far has done no harm you can name is probably not a good approach, it doesn't seem reasonable to people your age and it certainly will not to a 7th grader. \n\nGaming isn't inherently bad. It can actually train some skills, depending on genre. Stop demonizing it, read about it with an open mind. \n\nDepression is very common in teenagers, help your daugter understand and navigate negative feelings instead of judging a child for having them. \n\nSwearing may be rude, but it is and always has been a way to rebel in a harmless way. To be honest: As long as people understand that you can't swear at strangers, teachers or at your workplace, I don't see a problem with it.\n\nYou mentiond pictures of self harm and that's another thing you can help your child understand and navigate: Why do people do that to themselves? What can be done about it? What should she do, if she feels the urge?\n\n>I have seen her talk back to teachers in more than one occasion in online meetings, posts depressing, mature things on Instagram, swears, games all the time, and is generally a bad influence.\n\nReading just that paragraph, it can probably all be chucked up to teenagers being teenagers.\n\nBUT You titled this AITA for JUDGING a 13 year old and that alone makes you the asshole. We don't see, what she posts and how far she goes with it and the fact she was welcoming your daughter probably means, she is doing ok...but all of that could also point to some serious issues at home. If she oversexualizes, actually self harms, actually shows signs of depression, how is your first impuls to judge and not to make sure she is ok?\n\nAnd then I remember you saying in a comment how religion is \"proper stuff\" and I can't help but think that people declaring themselves as \"compassionate christians\" often find themselves only compassionate with people who are like them.\n\nYTA", "YTA - Do you remember being 12?

The girl you're describing was my best friend in school. She was mouthy and too smart for her age, and she protected me from bullies and stood up for me when I was too shy to do it myself.

My daughter had a friend like that, too, but she also had a boyfriend like that and he was simply awful. I like the new guy a lot better.   \n\n\nThis part of parenting is truly terrifying. You have to let your children make their own friends, and you have to watch them make mistakes. You have to stay out of their business, and you have to respect their privacy. The next five years determine whether you have a strong bond with your child or they go no contact with you the second they turn 18.   \n\n\nIt's okay not to like her friends, but if you want her to talk about her life with you, you have to respect her choices. You're probably not going to like her boyfriend either. But you're going to have to let her make mistakes now while you're still available to help pick up the pieces and clean up the mess. Don't let her wait until she goes off to college with zero experience in personal relationships. That's a recipe for disaster. Let her learn and be a good mentor.   \n\n\nYou've been a good parent up to now. She's a good kid. Trust the foundation you laid, and trust your child.

I also read, studied hard, and stood up for other people who got bullied instead of keeping my head down and trying to deflect the bullying that was already coming my way onto others for a peaceful life.\n\nThis is the kind of girl you WANT on your daughter's team. someone who isn't afraid to challenge what they feel isn't right and will fight for what IS. \n\nGo look at yourself, because your bully mentality is likely to ostracise your child and she won't have friendships at all.

She\u2019s not even doing anything crazy, pretty standard teenager behavior and you\u2019re less than a year away from having a teenager.

But not bad kids. But I think I would have been positively influenced and achieved more if I had a higher quality of friends group.", "Why is gaming such a bad thing?", "Yeah YTA. My recommendation is to lighten up Frances.", "YTA \n\nMaybe be clear with your own child that you'd not be happy with her swearing, or maybe if you're really concerned about this new friendship you could discuss with the school - they'll have a fuller picture of this other child and her level of 'concerningness'", "THIS IS BAIT", "You made the choice to ask a parenting question on a page where most of the commentors are closer to your daughter's age, so obviously the knee jerk reaction is 'how dare you tell your child how to live their life???'\n\nBut that's your job. Is this kid really a bad influence? Hard to tell from your description. The thing is, telling a 13 year old 'dont be friends with this person' is a surefire way to get them to rebell. You have to be smarter than that. Talk to her, ask about what they do together, etc. If you raised your daughter right and that other kid truly is bad news, she will eventually see it on her own. But if your kid gives you more info and you realize you have been overreacting, backpedaling will not make you look weak, it will strengthen your relationship to admit to mistakes. \n\nNAH yet", "Nope. I chose my daughter\u2019s friend all through school. She hated me. She is grown and now sees where those girls ended up. She thanks me often.", "Well I see you're concerned and that is just you being a responsible mom. I see why you're being concerned. \n\nHowever, your little one is not so little any longer and you might need to come to terms with your kid entering teenage zone now. \n\nFrom what I see here there's nothing overly alarming but you have your gut feeling and sometimes this gut feeling is about right even if you can't explain to others very well. \n\nThe thing is forbidding something at that age typically makes the thing (in this case the friendship) more interesting and your kid may go behind your back. \n\nSo rather than forbidding I'd say you should check up on your kid regularly and communicate on how you find this girls behaviour not good and/or inappropiate. You can try to reduce contact by simply not allowing specific outings and such but you must be clear that if your kid wants this girl as a friend badly you can't prevent it (not with normal measures) completely.", "NTA - you\u2019re concerned. That doesn\u2019t make you an asshole. But sheltering and forbidding your daughter to hang out with someone isn\u2019t the best course of action imo. It\u2019ll likely backfire and as others have said, your daughter will likely only hang out with this girl and do these things but hide them from you. \n\nYour role is not to shelter your daughter from this but rather prepare her to encounter and manage these things. But you are also her parent and your daughter and this girl are still children. I don\u2019t agree with people who say to go ahead and let your child hang out with her. Their thinking is that she will learn to manage difficult situations by being exposed to those difficult situations. That is misguided. Children can\u2019t learn how to manage big emotions on their own. They need adults to show how to manage all that big stuff in a healthy, mature, responsible way. Immature children cannot teach other children to be mature. They can only teach them to continue being immature. \n\nSo rather than forbidding your daughter to see this girl, your best course of action is to invite this girl yourself to hang out with your daughter with some supervision. Not watching their every move. But invite this girl to your house. \n\nYour concerns are totally valid. Your daughter just moved schools so she is emotionally vulnerable because she is looking for friends and companionship. She could be very easily susceptible to peer pressure. But you have judged this girl perhaps unfairly. You don\u2019t really know at this point. You might be correct and this girl is a mean girl leader who has taken an interest in your daughter because she enjoys causing trouble and sees the vulnerable situation in your daughter and can manipulate her to feel a sense of power. Or she might be a troubled young girl who could also use a friend and maybe just a bit more care and guidance from an adult and could feel empowered by befriending another girl who is in a vulnerable situation. At this point no one has any idea which scenario is more likely. Your best bet is to let them be friends but on your terms. Spend time with both of them. Do things with both of them. Don\u2019t involve yourself too much, but do things for this other girl as well so that maybe she sees you as someone who cares and not just another adult trying to control her", "Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer!", "NTA", "NTA, you want what\u2019s best for your children but you have addressed concerns and unfortunately cannot be there to make every decision for them. At some point they are going to hang around or be In The company of people you don\u2019t like, and may in the end not be good for them, but you can\u2019t dictate that, they need to learn and you can be there to support but not judge along the way", "NTA, the main problem is that your daughter \u201cidolizes\u201d the girl, and this is coming from a teenager. \n\nI get you don\u2019t know what kind of upbringing this girl has so you feel bad but when it comes to who your daughter hangs around I think you should have some kind of say. Obviously you shouldn\u2019t be safeguarding her from every single person but it is true when people say \u201cyou are who you hang around\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s not good that your daughter puts this girl on a pedestal because she might start acting like her. Which could be talking about the same depressive subjects, talking back for fun, and other bad influence stuff. Especially if your daughter hasn\u2019t been exposed to this behavior before. I know for a fact and have seen it with many of my friends that you fall into a group with a certain person or two and you will change .\n\nSure you don\u2019t want to limit her from making her own friends, but if I\u2019m going to be honest, if it\u2019s that bad you can. It\u2019s your daughter, you shouldn\u2019t control her but atleast TRY to steer her in the right direction. And honestly this could be in having talks with her telling her that boosts her self esteem regarding her personality, her style, her looks because that might be what\u2019s causing her to \u201cidolize\u201d someone else. If you do let them hang out, have it be at your house or you driving them places most of the time (nothing too overbearing, because it\u2019ll cause rebellion) . Look for any changes in the long run that can be bad. Be more caring towards your daughter. You reaffirming a healthy home life will reflect what boundaries she sets within her own life.\n\n\nPotentially you telling her not to hang with this person might cause her to want to more, to rebel so be careful in how strong you come off! Especially at this young teenage stage where kids want to start being their own person. And the reasoning you give her to should also be mindful. If you\u2019re straight telling her \u201cthis girl is a bad influence\u201d and your daughter obviously wants to make her feel welcomed. That might cause her to want to see the light in her (which she might have if you\u2019re just over analyzing) and want your daughter to hang out with her more.\n\nI really don\u2019t see how people are saying YTA. This is a very strong concern when it comes to teenagers and how they get influenced. Should you be an overbearing, controlling mom ( telling her exactly who she can and cannot hang out with) , no. But should you let anyone hang out with your kids especially when you see the kind of influence they could bring, clearly not. \n\nEven try asking your daughter very smoothly why she likes the girl so much, could be because she\u2019s new to her, or she wants to be like her . The \u201cidolizing\u201d is a very important part!!!\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "NTA, shes a bad influence, I've seen such cases before and trust me it will have a huge impact on their personalities for their life, I highly recommend changing schools before she's influenced badly, it can cause irrepairable damage to your daughter's personality.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your overprotectiveness is not healthy, fostering anxieties and animosity in your child. Eventually when they grow up, they will resent you for that. Have seen it happen in my own family.

But one girl was kind to me, she would stick up for me when others would call me names, and she would invite me to do activities that I hadn\u2019t done before because no one wanted to be friends with the black kid.
