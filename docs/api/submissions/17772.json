Bro was invited to present at a pretty prestigious health conference in the city me and him both live in (he lives alone about 10 min drive away while I live with my wife (F33)). As my wife and I also work in health care, we were also invited to attend.\n\nMy brother was super nervous to present there and wanted to go there very very early. Since I knew me and my wife would also be going, I insisted that we give him a ride, he reluctantly agreed and cancelled his uber. The morning of, I wanted to go to my brother latter than we agreed to meet. This because I thought that if he showed up so early, he would just be nervous as there would't be anything for him to do after he set up.\n\nMy wife wanted us to go to my brother at the time we originally agreed to meet and told me that my line of thinking made \u201cno sense\u201d and would \u201conly stress him more\u201d. I didn't want to argue with her so instead took I took extra time getting ready. As we were leaving he called me and sounded super impatient asking where I was? I said I'd be there in soon. Unfortunately traffic slowed us down quite a bit\n\nWe arrived at my brother's apartment around 20 min after the call with him already waiting outside, he just got into the car and didn't say much the entire trip making the whole ride awkward.When we got to the conference brother didn't thank me for the ride and instead said he had to rush to set up with his supervisor.Over the course of the conference, but my wife kept saying I apologize to brother if I see him, but I told her that it wasn't necessary as never hold grudges.\n\nAfter the conference concluded, he texted me saying he wasn't feeling well and decided to go home instead of waiting for us and catching a ride with us back. He also told me that his supervisor \u201cchewed him out for being late\u201d and I felt that this was a bit dramatic and backhanded. I asked him if he wanted to have dinner with us but he declined. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: I've tried calling him this morning, but he hasn't returned any of my calls. He did however pick up when my wife called as she wanted to check in on him. I understand that he may be offended by doesn't he share a degree of responsibility when it comes setting things right?\n\nEdit 2: Got of the phone with my mother (F59), she told me that she'd cut off all contact with me if I didn't apologize ASAP and even if I did she may still cut off contact if my brother doesn't think the apology is \"good enough\". She didn't wait for me to explain myself and instead hung up once she finished, she hasn't been answering my calls since.\n\nEdit 3: I texted my brother saying \"Sorry to inconvenience you yesterday, I meant to be helpful.\" Since I sent it on whatsapp, I saw he read the message but only responded 2 hours afterwards. I did think it was a little strange that he took a such a long time to respond. He's response was just \"Its okay\". I talked to him a while after on the phone. He was pretty quiet most of the call but did say he accepted my apology\n\nEdit 4: For those wondering, I'm an anesthesiologist, so the notion that I'm jealous of him is baseless.", "created_utc": 1684606034, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13n1svf/aita_for_ruining_my_brothers_conference/", "score": 131, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
