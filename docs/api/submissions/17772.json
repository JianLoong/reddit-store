Bro was invited to present at a pretty prestigious health conference in the city me and him both live in (he lives alone about 10 min drive away while I live with my wife (F33)). As my wife and I also work in health care, we were also invited to attend.\n\nMy brother was super nervous to present there and wanted to go there very very early. Since I knew me and my wife would also be going, I insisted that we give him a ride, he reluctantly agreed and cancelled his uber. The morning of, I wanted to go to my brother latter than we agreed to meet. This because I thought that if he showed up so early, he would just be nervous as there would't be anything for him to do after he set up.\n\nMy wife wanted us to go to my brother at the time we originally agreed to meet and told me that my line of thinking made \u201cno sense\u201d and would \u201conly stress him more\u201d. I didn't want to argue with her so instead took I took extra time getting ready. As we were leaving he called me and sounded super impatient asking where I was? I said I'd be there in soon. Unfortunately traffic slowed us down quite a bit\n\nWe arrived at my brother's apartment around 20 min after the call with him already waiting outside, he just got into the car and didn't say much the entire trip making the whole ride awkward.When we got to the conference brother didn't thank me for the ride and instead said he had to rush to set up with his supervisor.Over the course of the conference, but my wife kept saying I apologize to brother if I see him, but I told her that it wasn't necessary as never hold grudges.\n\nAfter the conference concluded, he texted me saying he wasn't feeling well and decided to go home instead of waiting for us and catching a ride with us back. He also told me that his supervisor \u201cchewed him out for being late\u201d and I felt that this was a bit dramatic and backhanded. I asked him if he wanted to have dinner with us but he declined. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: I've tried calling him this morning, but he hasn't returned any of my calls. He did however pick up when my wife called as she wanted to check in on him. I understand that he may be offended by doesn't he share a degree of responsibility when it comes setting things right?\n\nEdit 2: Got of the phone with my mother (F59), she told me that she'd cut off all contact with me if I didn't apologize ASAP and even if I did she may still cut off contact if my brother doesn't think the apology is \"good enough\". She didn't wait for me to explain myself and instead hung up once she finished, she hasn't been answering my calls since.\n\nEdit 3: I texted my brother saying \"Sorry to inconvenience you yesterday, I meant to be helpful.\" Since I sent it on whatsapp, I saw he read the message but only responded 2 hours afterwards. I did think it was a little strange that he took a such a long time to respond. He's response was just \"Its okay\". I talked to him a while after on the phone. He was pretty quiet most of the call but did say he accepted my apology\n\nEdit 4: For those wondering, I'm an anesthesiologist, so the notion that I'm jealous of him is baseless.", "created_utc": 1684606034, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13n1svf/aita_for_ruining_my_brothers_conference/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've worked backstage at events like this and we always have to load and test the presentations, and have time to make adjustments if anything doesn't work as planned. You left your brother no time for any of this, and that's extremely stressful for everyone involved.", "Supreme self-unawareness, that's how.", "The mother is threatening to go NC if OP doesn't apologize and if the apology isn't good enough for OP!", "I'm left wondering if OP convinced bro to accept his ride just so he could fuck bro over.", "I can. People like OP are horribly self-unaware.", "That's exactly what OP wanted.", "OP is one of these people late all the time but it isn't their fault. Because planning for traffic is just unreasonable.", "\u201cChill, dude, it\u2019s no big deal\u201d.  STFU, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!", "He's completely clueless to boot. Notice the quotes around the word *ruining*.", "Yeah what OP said was no where near an apology.", "Not to mention just finding the room while lugging all your materials around can be nerve wracking. Brother probably didn't have time to use the bathroom or get a drink of water.", "He definitely did it to hurt his brother \n\nYTA", "That's exactly what this was - sabotage.", "I know what's best for you. Besides, we'll be the only ones on the road!  /s", "I love it when obvious YTA s post _multiple_ edits as if there's anything they could possibly say to save themselves\n\nPersonal favourite here is #4 - \"I have a good job so I couldn't possibly be jealous\" as if that's even vaguely how it works", "YTA. Traffic is a thing and he was supposed to be there for setup. You've created problems for him with his boss, genius.", "YTA\n\nIn my 25 year career I have put on over 200 medical conferences and you are the WORST.\n\nand FYI - those speakers who are inconsiderate and show up at the last minute are \"marked\" and if that type of behavior repeated their reputation would be impacted.", "YTA. This was a very big deal for your brother, and for some unknown reason, you decided you knew better. Maybe you were jealous because your younger brother was going to be in the limelight. It was his special day, and you made him late. And then you can\u2019t even take responsibility for it.\n\nAdding, why your jealous. Your brother is getting his PhD, you\u2019re not going to be the only Dr any more, and he was giving a presentation at a health conference and you weren\u2019t.", "YTA no doubt.", "Yta\n\nConferences are a good reason to be anxious and sometimes that's a good thing because it drives you to be ready. I got to the airport early for my conference today. The driver for the other carpool went eh don't worry about it and basically did the same thing as OP. they showed up in time to join the last boarding flight with one of them being the third to last to board, absolutely ruining the nerves of the four people he was driving. \n\nThe mom's willingness to cut you off after this one offense is clueing me in on some other of OP's behaviors.", "Damn, you\u2019re a total asshole, and you should have known better being a doctor, how important these things are. So yeah - Y T A", "YTA. Does being an anaesthetist mean you can't be jealous? \n\nNone of your business what time he gets there.\n\nYou're a jealous self-righteous AH and you should grovel.", "YTA-who are you to decide what is best in regards to his arrival time. He told you what time he needed to be there and you arrogantly decided you knew better and deduced he should arrive late. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t share any  of the responsibility for this debacle. This is all on you and you owe him a big apology.  Stop being so arrogant and making decisions for others because you think you know better. Shame on you!", "YTA.\n\nSo you are an Anesthesiologist.\n\nAnd this didn't give you any indication that being on time is the most important thing for the medical Industry?", "You\u2019re a huge, arrogant, know it all asshole. Everything you add or comment makes that even more clear. YTA", "YTA and so shitty at apologizing. You sound like a nightmare.", "Your a super AH, you sound unbearable.", "YTA. Why is it so important to you that everyone do things your way?", "YTA. What your  brother learned in that moment is that you can't be trusted.  \n\n           \nYour mother seems to have excused and glossed over your manipulative and heavy handed \"older brother knows best\" crap for most of your life, and she can now see that it was a huge mistake on her part which is why she is willing to cut you off if you don't give a meaningful apology to your brother in this moment.  \n         \nIf your wife has an iota of sense, she will be rethinking her partnership with you, because she gave you good advice, you ignored it, but instead of being up front that you were going to be an AH, you just took your time in a sneaky way.\n           \nYou honestly sound like more work than you are worth.", "Did anyone else envision OP shouting \u201cI am an anesthesiologist\u201d in monotone", "YTA.  You sabotaged him.", "Yta, and I can only hope you\u2019re secretly jealous of your brother, because the alternatives are so much worse.", "Yta.  You have pointed out that being jealous is ridiculous which in itself is an insulting comment.  However I don\u2019t think you are jealous.  You just are belittling your brother\u2019s accomplishments.  You need to make a heartfelt apology immediately to your brother.  Grovel.  Tell him you are an idiot for your behavior and that there is no excuse.   Your apology you gave to him is a non apology and he may say he accepted it but he really did not.", "You aren\u2019t jealous doctor just thoughtless. YTA.", "YTA. You got him to cancel his ride? Why, so you could exert your will over his? Powertripping AH.", "> I understand that he may be offended by doesn't he share a degree of responsibility when it comes setting things right?\n\nNO he does not share a degree of responsibility for you deliberately going against your agreed time for his important event, and basically deliberately SABOTAGING him.  \n\n\n>: I texted my brother saying \"Sorry to inconvenience you yesterday, I meant to be helpful.\" Since I sent it on whatsapp, I saw he read the message but only responded 2 hours afterwards. **I did think it was a little strange that he took a such a long time to respond.** \n\nReally? You found it strange?   \n\n\nYou might have been capable of learning the scientific and technical details of anesthesiology but youre quite dense, otherwise extremely entitled and OMG your audacity.   \n\n\nYTA and a big one", "YTA. And you seem quite proud of yourself. You don\u2019t get to dictate what is better for other people", "Even with the edits he sent a \"non apology\". OP needs to do some self reflection and even with everyone chewing him out here, and his family chewing him out, it's not getting through.", "It\u2019s not a screw up, it\u2019s sabotage. YTA", "Yeah, OP was the Ah from the post, but his edits would make me cut him off completely. What a dick, and the edits imply to me that he set out to deliberately sabotage his brother.", "He's an aircraft carrier stuffed full of, and completely covered in, overflowing bags of dicks."]}
