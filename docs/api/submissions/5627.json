I have had multiple ideas for his gift for a long time. Originally, I was going to get him tickets to see a band that I knew he loved, but another show was announced at the beginning of December that was coming to our area for the first time so I bought him tickets for that instead. He did know about these tickets before Christmas, because I wanted to make sure I got seats close enough and I didn\u2019t want him to try and buy tickets when I already had them. He is very excited for the show and has thanked me a million times. \n\nSo, I know he is a little tighter on money this month so I wasn\u2019t expecting anything big or extravagant. I opened my gift to find some chocolate and a gift card to a craft store. I tried to hide my disappointment, because I felt like I always try to give him something he will enjoy, and to me a gift card seems like a cop-out. I still thanked him and we continued to cuddle on the couch. Eventually, he noticed I was a little off and asked me about it. I tried to shrug it off because I really don\u2019t want to fight on Christmas, but eventually I did tell him I was a little upset about the gift card.\n \nHere is where I may be TA. I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t put much thought into it, and I always try to give him something he will enjoy. He told me he knows I like crafting, but didn\u2019t know what to get me so thought a gift card would let me pick something I\u2019d like out. He called me a brat and told me I was just upset because the monetary value of my gift was lower than his, which is not true. He used to have a note on his phone where he would keep a list of things I said I want or like for Christmas, but when he got a new phone it was deleted. I also told him that I don\u2019t want to have to tell him what to get me. \n\nNow we\u2019re not really talking and he just keeps passively aggressively saying that he\u2019ll do better next year. I don\u2019t really know what to do or say to fix the situation, and I feel like AH. I didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings by telling him this, but I also was hurt by the seemingly lack of thought. \n\nIf I am TA, please tell me. I\u2019m really not trying to be a brat, but I need to know if I am.", "created_utc": 1671988744, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zv27h4/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_gift_from_my_partner/", "score": 416, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It took me 5 years to figure out she is not great at giving gifts.  Ever since I figured this out my Xmasses have been awesome.  \n\nI can not wait to use my giant bottle of grapeseed oil tonight.  I will have the biggest smile on my face making dinner.", "NTA - After your extra info, this should have been just a simple conversation in a relationship about expectations and effort and you felt gift card was a cop-out but he did put thought behind it knowing you like crafts but not knowing what to get you. The reason this is not a NAH is because he called you a brat.", "NTA  You didn't throw a fit or anything, but your partner could tell that they let you down.  Now they are being ridiculous and throwing a tantrum because you were honest.  If they had put some effort in and made you a gift, you would have appreciated the effort, it's not about the cost.  It's that they don't care enough to bother.", "Honestly, I'd have been thrilled with that gift. I love chocolate and crafting so that seems like a pretty sweet deal to me. I actually like it a lot when I'm given a gift card because I like being able to go get stuff I like. \n\nHe wasn't being lazy. He thought about this. He didn't just pick up a quick gift card for a fast food place or something. He got it for something that you like to do. That shows intent and thought so your assuming he just didn't care is probably not too valid. \n\nObviously I don't know how much he spent but to me it would not matter at all. Just the idea that someone thinks of me and gifts me is enough. \n\nI got an open box toaster oven from a pal online. That hasn't arrived as yet but she sent me a little e-card, a pic and the manual and let me know it will be here next week. I didn't expect it and I'm thrilled to actually get a gift from someone else for once. Other than that I had to buy my own holiday gifts. I just don't have a lot of people in my life to give me gifts anymore. \n\nI always appreciated the gifts but it's the people I miss not having these  days. Nobody dear to me to celebrate the holidays with. My folks they died years apart but both between Christmas and New Year's. A good friend also passed this time of year. \n\nI do okay but I keep things in perspective too. At least I'm housed, I have healthcare and I have a small income to depend upon. Two years ago I was broke, sitting in a shelter feeling sorry for myself. Now I'm in my own place and I could afford to buy myself a little gift for Yule. \n\nYou're very lucky to have a guy who loves you. That's a major gift itself. You have a loved one to celebrate the holidays with who  actually cared enough to buy you a gift card and chocolates. That's more than a lot of people. So count your blessings and enjoy them.\n\n:)", "I\u2019m going through a similar situation, but I was the one told I didn\u2019t put enough thought into the gift. \ud83d\udc80 I was thinking about posting my story on here too! \ud83e\udd23 But as a fellow crafter, I would love a gift card bcuz that gives me the option of getting exactly what I want. \n\nHowever, getting only a gift card and chocolates seems like a gift from a friend, not your bf, so I\u2019m going with NTA. \n\nIt does seem like a cop-out gift. Had he added at least 1 more thing that was meaningful to you, I would be on his side, but he didn\u2019t, so I\u2019m on your side.  \n\nIf you\u2019re curious about my situation, I\u2019ll be posting it shortly.", "To me, you are NTA because I think gift cards are a cop out also. \n\nI keep my own list on Amazon. This year my parents and boyfriend all had the list and got me things off of that list. My mom deviated a little bit and bought similar items in the same colors. There was effort made to get me things I like. \n\nI am amazed at how many posts I've seen this morning asking it people are AH for being disappointed. The last one I read about was socks and a GameStop gift card.\n\nGift cards just aren't personal and I'd say family members giving them can often end up with the recipient feeling kinda bummed. \n\nSignificant others giving them...eh. seriously they didn't want to put in the effort imo and I'd be disappointed also. \n\nEveryone is different though. Maybe he really loves gift cards so he can pick what he wants. I think most women expect something thoughtful from their significant other though.", "NTA, but has your boyfriend ever shown a knack for giving meaningful gifts to people in his life? If he has, did those people tell him what to get them, or did he pick it out? \n\nGift giving is a skill. You have to practice it, and you have to observe the person you\u2019re buying for. Then you have to think, consider options, discard some, add others. It comes natural to some, and is completely foreign to others. Consider helping him out. An ongoing Amazon wishlist that you update from time to time. That way he can get you something from the list and be safe, then as he gets comfortable, he can expand and add to what\u2019s on the list with his own initiative.", "Wow, I really disagree with the first commenters here.  You\u2019re NTA.\n\nLike you said, it\u2019s not the monetary value.  But a gift card for someone you\u2019ve been dating a long time doesn\u2019t feel appropriate at all.  It\u2019s a cop-out.  I\u2019d be bummed with a gift card, and so would my partner of two years.  It sends a message of \u201cyeah your gift was kind of a rushed afterthought\u201d, which is a shitty message to receive from your long-time partner on Christmas.", "I hate the tradition of gift giving based on dates and occasions. \n\nChristmas/birthdays/valentines whatever, it all feels like a massive test of relationships between people.", "NTA. A gift card is a zero effort present. It\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s about not recognizing that they should know you well enough to be able to find a meaningful present at any price point.", "[deleted]", "I know you say it\u2019s not about monetary value, but I\u2019d be upset if it was like 10$ gift card vs 200$ tickets. But if it the sum is comparable, and allows you to actually buy something nice, that\u2019s a very good present imo. \nIf he couldn\u2019t afford a comparable present, he should have told you he\u2019d get the tickets (at least his ticket) himself. \n\nSo, INFO: was the price comparable?", "Idk, I'm a crafter myself, and after the cricut incident I read about on this sub, I'd much rather someone get me a gift card to a craft store than get me something specific I may never use. You may want to try letting him know what your favorite activities are around the holidays so he can pick up something thoughtful without feeling overwhelmed while trying to pick something out. I can understand how someone can think \"oh I'll get my partner knitting needles!\" And then being overwhelmed by the different guage sizes available. \n\nI lean NAH because he /did/ think of you and money was tight for him, and gift giving comes more naturally to some than to others. Gift conversations can be really awkward to have because they put you and your partner on the spot; your partner doesn't want to feel thoughtless and you don't want to feel selfish or ungrateful, and I get that! But if you go about it the right way you'll both understand where the value of gifts comes from for each of you, and he'll feel more prepared to shop for you.", "NTA\n\nHe was lazy and he called you a brat. I don't find it ok to name someone a brat and I would be extremely pissed. To me it's even worse than the bad gift because he's becoming aggressiv while called off for his bad gift.\n\nTo be honest: I find it extremely hard to find gifts for my husband - same for him. So we actively communicate when we don't have ideas, that it would be cool if the other could name some ideas. If not, we COMMUNICATE that there will not be much. Sometimes I have a good idea for him and sometimes he has a good idea for me. We enjoy it then. But we don't put much expectative in it.", "NTA. I would be upset especially if he knew you put thought in. I have always made it clear that the present is really the time and effort you put into trying to do something nice. When a present comes with either an obvious lack of effort, or a comment about it not being a good present, I think it\u2019s reasonable to be upset. That said it\u2019s important you tell him how you feel about it. \n\nFor years my husband would either not buy me anything at all or put it such a half arsed effort it seemed more insulting than nothing. I clearly articulated (admittedly repeatedly) the problems this was causing (or perhaps reflecting) and this year he bought me a very cheap but very thoughtful gift. I loved it. It\u2019s really not the money it\u2019s the effort. \n\nI hope you guys can sort it out. I think saying something and a good thing, communication is necessary in longer term relationships.", "I feel like you both kind of suck. Yeah a gift card doesn\u2019t seem super thoughtful but making it into comparison shopping (my gift good his gift bad) feels like there\u2019s more than the gift at play here. He may very well embarrassed as heck but that doesn\u2019t excuses his resentful snapping (oth what can he say here? once the fight started I\u2019m not sure how anyone wins).\n\nYou know, you both suck is way too harsh- what I mean is you seem to suck at each other. Like this just doesn\u2019t seem like a happy relationship.", "I say NAH. Not everyone is good at gifts, that's just a fact, I personally would much rather a gift card than something I wouldn't use but no matter what I get I'm going to be grateful for it.", "NTA \nMy story fyi from decades back for a laugh. Ex bf wanted me to have a 35mm camera so I could photograph his band. I didn't want one and before my July birthday told him it wasn't for me. My birthday came; no gift, just song and dance about a delay. Months go by; no gift. Christmas we went to his mother's- and there's a gift for me. Crudely wrapped, no box or case, a clearly used 35mm camera. He got his ex's baby a cute sweater though, and spent half an hour talking to her on the phone.\nThe end was nigh.", "well I'm sick of this. What ever happened to gratitude?", "NTA It\u2019s not unreasonable to want your partner of all people to come up with a more thoughtful gift. If he\u2019s around you that often, he would probably know what type of crafting you do like or could come up with a ton of other gift ideas. I try to reserve gift cards for people I don\u2019t spend as much time with. While gift cards can still be a thoughtful gift, not necessarily for your partner.", "Info: what in your opinion makes what you got for him more thoughtful than what he got for you?", "YTA.  He did put thought into your gift.  He knew you enjoyed crafting and got you something so you could get what you wanted/needed to do it.", "YTA. He knew what you liked but didn\u2019t know where to start with getting you something, so he gave you something that would allow you to pick for yourself. I would much prefer someone give me a gift card to a place they know I like if they\u2019re unsure what I would like from there, and it\u2019s childish and immature to think he didn\u2019t put any thought into it. He clearly did as he recalled this place is somewhere you like going for your crafts.", "Info: Did you say to him that you try to get him things he would enjoy or is that just context for here?", "YTA. The only appropriate response to a gift is \"thank you\". No sulking. No obvious attempts to draw concern from him when you are disappointed in the materialistic aspect of this holiday. \n\nAlso, you do a lot of mental gymnastics to convince yourself that you tried to avoid a conflict. But you didn't. You \"tried\" to hide your disappointment. You felt his gift was \" a cop out\". You \"tried to shrug it off but eventually told him you were upset\". You didn't actually try to avoid this conflict at all. It is in your best interest to stop lying to yourself about that.\n\nYou were ungrateful. You were counting up the value of his gift. You pouted noticably enough that you could draw him into a conversation about it. You manipulated that interaction. You are being a brat in more ways than one.", "YTA because 1) your bf seems to have been legitimately unsure of what you would like most for crafting so got you a gift card for a place you like to shop but mostly because 2) you want him to read your mind. Super lame IMO to say \"I don't want to have to tell you what to get me.\" You reap what you sow. Either give him a list and be happy you got something you liked or forgo the list and risk disappointment. I personally think giving a list is a nice gesture to help the other person.\n\nAlso, getting a gift card is great. Who doesn't like to shop on someone else's dime? Why not try to see the bright side?", "ESH: You need to be more clear with your expectations in the future.  He probably thought he did good even though it was a lazy way to go about it.", "YTA.  The only appropriate response to any gift is \"thank you.\" If you're obsessed with effort or price being \"even,\" you need to do some growing up before you try to have a relationship.", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA. You\u2019re saying is not about the $ value but it sounds like it is. Christmas isn\u2019t supposed to be about what you get or who can spend the most. I would apologize.", "YTA I cannot imagine being in my 20s and complaining about a gift card. You don\u2019t want to tell him what to get but the guy isn\u2019t a mind reader.", "YTA, everyone is different when it comes to gift giving. Some (like myself) are naturally good at picking out thoughtful gifts and plan far ahead. Other's are just terrible and do most of their shopping in a last minute panic. If you get upset over this you will always be upset. Instead you need to clearly communicate what you want and like, help people improve on their gift giving. I was actually suprised by myself this year, I thought I hadn't planned something for my husband (I bought concert tickets for february so a big gift was already covered) but in my gift box in the closet (yes, I'm one of those that stock up on gifts ahead of time when there are sales and special offers) I found some small but very thoughtful things for him. I got a book of this years Noble prize winner (which I always get). I'm still happy. We're different.", "YTA. If you do enjoy crafting, it is better to have a gift card for that than to have him pick out things you may not want or need. And if you don't think you should have to tell him what to get you, how is this man ever going to get you something you'll be happy with or want?\n\nLiterally every year I get asked by family what I want. Most of the time I only ask for things I need. Because I have most of what I want. If there's something, I mention it. If someone gets me something I didn't ask for, I still appreciate it. They didn't have to get me anything, but they chose to.", "NTA. He put 0 thoughts into your gift, pressured you to talk about it when you tried to move past it AND then had the right to blame you. Huge red flag on his side tbh\n\n\nEdit: also, he *had* a list on his old phone and he didn't bother remembering something from the list? Does he care that little?", "YTA. It's always an AH move to be snotty over a gift.  Every time.  It's a gift. Gratitude is a good look on everyone.", "I'm going with ESH. I understand that you're disappointed because a gift card feels impersonal, but it's also rude to act ungrateful when someone gives you a gift. I think you should both apologize and move past it.", "Slight YTA. Some people just aren\u2019t that great at getting gifts. My husband is kind of the same way, but I dont take it personally because I know its the thought that counts. You\u2019re just upset because you dont think he put the same amount of thought into the gift that you did.", "YTA wish lists exist for a reason if you\u2019re are hoping for something specific then you need to say so.\nBut if someone takes the time to get a gift for you then IMO you should be thankful.", "If someone wants to give me a gift related to knitting, I'd much rather have a gift card to pick out my own yarn rather than have yarn I don't want.\n\nI'm not sure if he's being passive aggressive. I think he's being berated and is saying that he'll do better next year.\n\nYou say money is tight, so a gift card to a craft store is practical. He won't waste money on cheap junk and you'll still be able to get crafting supplies, which would be harder to buy with limited funds.\n\nYTA", "\u201cI know he is a little tighter on money this month so I wasn\u2019t expecting anything big or extravagant\u202
