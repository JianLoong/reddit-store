I have had multiple ideas for his gift for a long time. Originally, I was going to get him tickets to see a band that I knew he loved, but another show was announced at the beginning of December that was coming to our area for the first time so I bought him tickets for that instead. He did know about these tickets before Christmas, because I wanted to make sure I got seats close enough and I didn\u2019t want him to try and buy tickets when I already had them. He is very excited for the show and has thanked me a million times. \n\nSo, I know he is a little tighter on money this month so I wasn\u2019t expecting anything big or extravagant. I opened my gift to find some chocolate and a gift card to a craft store. I tried to hide my disappointment, because I felt like I always try to give him something he will enjoy, and to me a gift card seems like a cop-out. I still thanked him and we continued to cuddle on the couch. Eventually, he noticed I was a little off and asked me about it. I tried to shrug it off because I really don\u2019t want to fight on Christmas, but eventually I did tell him I was a little upset about the gift card.\n \nHere is where I may be TA. I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t put much thought into it, and I always try to give him something he will enjoy. He told me he knows I like crafting, but didn\u2019t know what to get me so thought a gift card would let me pick something I\u2019d like out. He called me a brat and told me I was just upset because the monetary value of my gift was lower than his, which is not true. He used to have a note on his phone where he would keep a list of things I said I want or like for Christmas, but when he got a new phone it was deleted. I also told him that I don\u2019t want to have to tell him what to get me. \n\nNow we\u2019re not really talking and he just keeps passively aggressively saying that he\u2019ll do better next year. I don\u2019t really know what to do or say to fix the situation, and I feel like AH. I didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings by telling him this, but I also was hurt by the seemingly lack of thought. \n\nIf I am TA, please tell me.

It took me 5 years to figure out she is not great at giving gifts.  Ever since I figured this out my Xmasses have been awesome.  \n\nI can not wait to use my giant bottle of grapeseed oil tonight.  I will have the biggest smile on my face making dinner.", "NTA - After your extra info, this should have been just a simple conversation in a relationship about expectations and effort and you felt gift card was a cop-out but he did put thought behind it knowing you like crafts but not knowing what to get you. The reason this is not a NAH is because he called you a brat.", "NTA  You didn't throw a fit or anything, but your partner could tell that they let you down.  Now they are being ridiculous and throwing a tantrum because you were honest.  If they had put some effort in and made you a gift, you would have appreciated the effort, it's not about the cost.  It's that they don't care enough to bother.", "Honestly, I'd have been thrilled with that gift. I love chocolate and crafting so that seems like a pretty sweet deal to me. I actually like it a lot when I'm given a gift card because I like being able to go get stuff I like. \n\nHe wasn't being lazy. He thought about this. He didn't just pick up a quick gift card for a fast food place or something. He got it for something that you like to do. That shows intent and thought so your assuming he just didn't care is probably not too valid. \n\nObviously I don't know how much he spent but to me it would not matter at all. Just the idea that someone thinks of me and gifts me is enough. \n\nI got an open box toaster oven from a pal online. That hasn't arrived as yet but she sent me a little e-card, a pic and the manual and let me know it will be here next week. I didn't expect it and I'm thrilled to actually get a gift from someone else for once. Other than that I had to buy my own holiday gifts. I just don't have a lot of people in my life to give me gifts anymore. \n\nI always appreciated the gifts but it's the people I miss not having these  days. Nobody dear to me to celebrate the holidays with. My folks they died years apart but both between Christmas and New Year's. A good friend also passed this time of year. \n\nI do okay but I keep things in perspective too. At least I'm housed, I have healthcare and I have a small income to depend upon. Two years ago I was broke, sitting in a shelter feeling sorry for myself. Now I'm in my own place and I could afford to buy myself a little gift for Yule. \n\nYou're very lucky to have a guy who loves you. That's a major gift itself. You have a loved one to celebrate the holidays with who  actually cared enough to buy you a gift card and chocolates. That's more than a lot of people. So count your blessings and enjoy them.\n\n:)", "I\u2019m going through a similar situation, but I was the one told I didn\u2019t put enough thought into the gift. \ud83d\udc80 I was thinking about posting my story on here too! \ud83e\udd23 But as a fellow crafter, I would love a gift card bcuz that gives me the option of getting exactly what I want. \n\nHowever, getting only a gift card and chocolates seems like a gift from a friend, not your bf, so I\u2019m going with NTA. \n\nIt does seem like a cop-out gift. Had he added at least 1 more thing that was meaningful to you, I would be on his side, but he didn\u2019t, so I\u2019m on your side.  \n\nIf you\u2019re curious about my situation, I\u2019ll be posting it shortly.", "To me, you are NTA because I think gift cards are a cop out also. \n\nI keep my own list on Amazon. This year my parents and boyfriend all had the list and got me things off of that list. My mom deviated a little bit and bought similar items in the same colors. There was effort made to get me things I like. \n\nI am amazed at how many posts I've seen this morning asking it people are AH for being disappointed. The last one I read about was socks and a GameStop gift card.\n\nGift cards just aren't personal and I'd say family members giving them can often end up with the recipient feeling kinda bummed. \n\nSignificant others giving them...eh. seriously they didn't want to put in the effort imo and I'd be disappointed also. \n\nEveryone is different though. Maybe he really loves gift cards so he can pick what he wants. I think most women expect something thoughtful from their significant other though.", "NTA, but has your boyfriend ever shown a knack for giving meaningful gifts to people in his life? If he has, did those people tell him what to get them, or did he pick it out? \n\nGift giving is a skill. You have to practice it, and you have to observe the person you\u2019re buying for. Then you have to think, consider options, discard some, add others. It comes natural to some, and is completely foreign to others. Consider helping him out. An ongoing Amazon wishlist that you update from time to time. That way he can get you something from the list and be safe, then as he gets comfortable, he can expand and add to what\u2019s on the list with his own initiative.", "Wow, I really disagree with the first commenters here.  You\u2019re NTA.\n\nLike you said, it\u2019s not the monetary value.  But a gift card for someone you\u2019ve been dating a long time doesn\u2019t feel appropriate at all.  It\u2019s a cop-out.  I\u2019d be bummed with a gift card, and so would my partner of two years.  It sends a message of \u201cyeah your gift was kind of a rushed afterthought\u201d, which is a shitty message to receive from your long-time partner on Christmas.", "I hate the tradition of gift giving based on dates and occasions. \n\nChristmas/birthdays/valentines whatever, it all feels like a massive test of relationships between people.", "NTA. A gift card is a zero effort present. It\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s about not recognizing that they should know you well enough to be able to find a meaningful present at any price point.", "[deleted]", "I know you say it\u2019s not about monetary value, but I\u2019d be upset if it was like 10$ gift card vs 200$ tickets. But if it the sum is comparable, and allows you to actually buy something nice, that\u2019s a very good present imo. \nIf he couldn\u2019t afford a comparable present, he should have told you he\u2019d get the tickets (at least his ticket) himself. \n\nSo, INFO: was the price comparable?", "Idk, I'm a crafter myself, and after the cricut incident I read about on this sub, I'd much rather someone get me a gift card to a craft store than get me something specific I may never use. You may want to try letting him know what your favorite activities are around the holidays so he can pick up something thoughtful without feeling overwhelmed while trying to pick something out. I can understand how someone can think \"oh I'll get my partner knitting needles!\" And then being overwhelmed by the different guage sizes available. \n\nI lean NAH because he /did/ think of you and money was tight for him, and gift giving comes more naturally to some than to others. Gift conversations can be really awkward to have because they put you and your partner on the spot; your partner doesn't want to feel thoughtless and you don't want to feel selfish or ungrateful, and I get that! But if you go about it the right way you'll both understand where the value of gifts comes from for each of you, and he'll feel more prepared to shop for you.", "NTA\n\nHe was lazy and he called you a brat. I don't find it ok to name someone a brat and I would be extremely pissed. To me it's even worse than the bad gift because he's becoming aggressiv while called off for his bad gift.\n\nTo be honest: I find it extremely hard to find gifts for my husband - same for him. So we actively communicate when we don't have ideas, that it would be cool if the other could name some ideas. If not, we COMMUNICATE that there will not be much. Sometimes I have a good idea for him and sometimes he has a good idea for me. We enjoy it then. But we don't put much expectative in it.", "NTA. I would be upset especially if he knew you put thought in. I have always made it clear that the present is really the time and effort you put into trying to do something nice. When a present comes with either an obvious lack of effort, or a comment about it not being a good present, I think it\u2019s reasonable to be upset. That said it\u2019s important you tell him how you feel about it. \n\nFor years my husband would either not buy me anything at all or put it such a half arsed effort it seemed more insulting than nothing. I clearly articulated (admittedly repeatedly) the problems this was causing (or perhaps reflecting) and this year he bought me a very cheap but very thoughtful gift. I loved it. It\u2019s really not the money it\u2019s the effort. \n\nI hope you guys can sort it out. I think saying something and a good thing, communication is necessary in longer term relationships.", "I feel like you both kind of suck. Yeah a gift card doesn\u2019t seem super thoughtful but making it into comparison shopping (my gift good his gift bad) feels like there\u2019s more than the gift at play here. He may very well embarrassed as heck but that doesn\u2019t excuses his resentful snapping (oth what can he say here? once the fight started I\u2019m not sure how anyone wins).\n\nYou know, you both suck is way too harsh- what I mean is you seem to suck at each other. Like this just doesn\u2019t seem like a happy relationship.", "I say NAH. Not everyone is good at gifts, that's just a fact, I personally would much rather a gift card than something I wouldn't use but no matter what I get I'm going to be grateful for it.", "NTA \nMy story fyi from decades back for a laugh. Ex bf wanted me to have a 35mm camera so I could photograph his band. I didn't want one and before my July birthday told him it wasn't for me. My birthday came; no gift, just song and dance about a delay. Months go by; no gift. Christmas we went to his mother's- and there's a gift for me. Crudely wrapped, no box or case, a clearly used 35mm camera. He got his ex's baby a cute sweater though, and spent half an hour talking to her on the phone.\nThe end was nigh.", "well I'm sick of this. What ever happened to gratitude?", "NTA It\u2019s not unreasonable to want your partner of all people to come up with a more thoughtful gift. If he\u2019s around you that often, he would probably know what type of crafting you do like or could come up with a ton of other gift ideas. I try to reserve gift cards for people I don\u2019t spend as much time with. While gift cards can still be a thoughtful gift, not necessarily for your partner.", "Info: what in your opinion makes what you got for him more thoughtful than what he got for you?", "YTA.  He did put thought into your gift.  He knew you enjoyed crafting and got you something so you could get what you wanted/needed to do it.", "YTA. He knew what you liked but didn\u2019t know where to start with getting you something, so he gave you something that would allow you to pick for yourself. I would much prefer someone give me a gift card to a place they know I like if they\u2019re unsure what I would like from there, and it\u2019s childish and immature to think he didn\u2019t put any thought into it. He clearly did as he recalled this place is somewhere you like going for your crafts.", "Info: Did you say to him that you try to get him things he would enjoy or is that just context for here?", "YTA. The only appropriate response to a gift is \"thank you\". No sulking. No obvious attempts to draw concern from him when you are disappointed in the materialistic aspect of this holiday. \n\nAlso, you do a lot of mental gymnastics to convince yourself that you tried to avoid a conflict. But you didn't. You \"tried\" to hide your disappointment. You felt his gift was \" a cop out\". You \"tried to shrug it off but eventually told him you were upset\". You didn't actually try to avoid this conflict at all. It is in your best interest to stop lying to yourself about that.\n\nYou were ungrateful. You were counting up the value of his gift. You pouted noticably enough that you could draw him into a conversation about it. You manipulated that interaction. You are being a brat in more ways than one.", "YTA because 1) your bf seems to have been legitimately unsure of what you would like most for crafting so got you a gift card for a place you like to shop but mostly because 2) you want him to read your mind. Super lame IMO to say \"I don't want to have to tell you what to get me.\" You reap what you sow. Either give him a list and be happy you got something you liked or forgo the list and risk disappointment. I personally think giving a list is a nice gesture to help the other person.\n\nAlso, getting a gift card is great. Who doesn't like to shop on someone else's dime? Why not try to see the bright side?", "ESH: You need to be more clear with your expectations in the future.  He probably thought he did good even though it was a lazy way to go about it.", "YTA.  The only appropriate response to any gift is \"thank you.\" If you're obsessed with effort or price being \"even,\" you need to do some growing up before you try to have a relationship.", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA. You\u2019re saying is not about the $ value but it sounds like it is. Christmas isn\u2019t supposed to be about what you get or who can spend the most. I would apologize.", "YTA I cannot imagine being in my 20s and complaining about a gift card. You don\u2019t want to tell him what to get but the guy isn\u2019t a mind reader.", "YTA, everyone is different when it comes to gift giving. Some (like myself) are naturally good at picking out thoughtful gifts and plan far ahead. Other's are just terrible and do most of their shopping in a last minute panic. If you get upset over this you will always be upset. Instead you need to clearly communicate what you want and like, help people improve on their gift giving. I was actually suprised by myself this year, I thought I hadn't planned something for my husband (I bought concert tickets for february so a big gift was already covered) but in my gift box in the closet (yes, I'm one of those that stock up on gifts ahead of time when there are sales and special offers) I found some small but very thoughtful things for him. I got a book of this years Noble prize winner (which I always get). I'm still happy. We're different.", "YTA. If you do enjoy crafting, it is better to have a gift card for that than to have him pick out things you may not want or need. And if you don't think you should have to tell him what to get you, how is this man ever going to get you something you'll be happy with or want?\n\nLiterally every year I get asked by family what I want. Most of the time I only ask for things I need. Because I have most of what I want. If there's something, I mention it. If someone gets me something I didn't ask for, I still appreciate it. They didn't have to get me anything, but they chose to.", "NTA. He put 0 thoughts into your gift, pressured you to talk about it when you tried to move past it AND then had the right to blame you. Huge red flag on his side tbh\n\n\nEdit: also, he *had* a list on his old phone and he didn't bother remembering something from the list? Does he care that little?", "YTA. It's always an AH move to be snotty over a gift.  Every time.  It's a gift. Gratitude is a good look on everyone.", "I'm going with ESH. I understand that you're disappointed because a gift card feels impersonal, but it's also rude to act ungrateful when someone gives you a gift. I think you should both apologize and move past it.", "Slight YTA. Some people just aren\u2019t that great at getting gifts. My husband is kind of the same way, but I dont take it personally because I know its the thought that counts. You\u2019re just upset because you dont think he put the same amount of thought into the gift that you did.", "YTA wish lists exist for a reason if you\u2019re are hoping for something specific then you need to say so.\nBut if someone takes the time to get a gift for you then IMO you should be thankful.", "If someone wants to give me a gift related to knitting, I'd much rather have a gift card to pick out my own yarn rather than have yarn I don't want.\n\nI'm not sure if he's being passive aggressive. I think he's being berated and is saying that he'll do better next year.\n\nYou say money is tight, so a gift card to a craft store is practical. He won't waste money on cheap junk and you'll still be able to get crafting supplies, which would be harder to buy with limited funds.\n\nYTA", "\u201cI know he is a little tighter on money this month so I wasn\u2019t expecting anything big or extravagant\u2026 (He) told me I was just upset because the monetary value of my gift was lower than his, which is not true\u201d\n\nWait, so you also didn\u2019t get him anything expensive or special? He told you something affordable he wanted and was very thankful for it. Then he tried to get you a gift he thought was relevant to your interest and missed. Not a big deal either way.\n\nIf you get a gift you don\u2019t love from someone that you know loves you, you don\u2019t have to pretend to love the gift, just let the person know even if your disappointed in the gift, you love them and that\u2019s more important. People can be insecure when giving gifts and it\u2019s always ideal to be frateful when you know intentions are good. I suspect you didn\u2019t handle it quite like this and he now thinks you love him less. And if you do love him less for not going big when money was tight, well that\u2019s far worse but I assume this was just a case of miscommunication.\n\nEither way, YTA, but not a huge one. This can be trivially fixed with an honest conversation. Merry Christmas", "YTA send me the card I would use it. I got nothing for xmas.  At least he thought about you.

For me, Christmas is not about giving gifts, so I really don't understand comparing gifts in any way. But - lots of people do, apparently.  Your feelings are your feelings.\n\nKnowing a lot of men, many of them freak out at gift-giving time as they know there is a LOT of pressure to pick the perfect gift.  They panic or pick something they think will be appreciated and get shit on for any number of reasons.  Many simply say screwit, I'll get a get card so at least she can pick something I know she'll like.  THAT's a thoughtful gift. He's trying not to pick the WRONG gift and risking getting blasted, or not living up to some unrealistic expectation.  His reaction is more likely from feeling like you think he's thoughtless or cheap or a combination.  If I were him I'd be upset, too.  I've seen this in people I know and it's brutal to watch.\n\nBut - you can feel however you feel because it's how you think.  You can't stop that.  But - he can also feel hurt, resentful, embarassed, upset.. all of the things that come with someone telling them they're thoughtless.

I say this because you said he said he wasn\u2019t sure what craft things to buy you so got you a voucher to where you buy things from. But I do think maybe getting you the gift card plus a few actual craft things he knows you always use to go with the gift card would have shown more thought. Even if he kept the receipt incase it was the wrong thing so you could exchange it. But I do get your feeling of disappointment after putting the amount of thought into his as you did.

What I ended up having to do is tell them that if they aren\u2019t specific with me, they are likely to be disappointed, even though I try really hard.

Similarly, some families and individuals like giving and receiving gift cards, especially related to hobbies. I'm into art, and particularly niche coloured pencils and fountain pens, so I don't expect anyone to know what to give me as I'm extremely picky. So a gift card from an art or stationary shop? YES! \nThat said, if we're talking about a live-in romantic partner, I would much prefer they ask me \"I was thinking about gifting you something related to X hobby, is there something you'd be eyeing?\". And then that's a reason to discuss said hobby and share my passion. \n\nI fully believe this could be resolved with communication.", "NTA.

You disagree and think blanketly that salon/spa gift cards are fine and blanketly others aren't so despite the fact that the spa gift card I got was impersonal and ultimately went unused it was a better gift than the craft gift card she got for her actual hobby of crafting. Doesn't that sound a bit illogical to you?", "you want people to respond to some specific scenario, okay. your specific situation had thought put into it.\n\n\u201cyou like crafting stuff, here\u2019s a card for a craft store\u201d is OBVIOUSLY less thoughtful. especially from a romantic partner.", "YTA. He knows that you enjoy crafting, but there are far too many variables to it.", "NTA. Saying this as a man; if he wanted to put the effort in, he would have.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA. He asked what was wrong, and you calmly explained how you felt. You weren\u2019t mean or accusatory or anything. Just politely explaining why you felt a little disappointed. You did nothing wrong. Sending love", "NAH\n\nThis may not be the popular judgement but I understand both sides from my understanding of your situation. \n\nYou did put a lot of effort into getting him a gift he'd like. That is wonderfully thoughtful of you. He got you a gift card and a box of chocolates. That does not sound like a ton of effort...but hear me out. Do you like chocolate? He thought you'd like that. I've received chocolate for gifts from family before because they knew I like chocolate. Sure, it's an easy gift and does not require a ton of effort. You like crafting stores. He got you a gift card because he didn't know specifically what you wanted but thought you'd appreciate buying something you'd like on him. Some people need specifics. Making a list you add to so he knows what you need or want is very helpful for people like that....even your boyfriend. My husband and my dad are like this. Unless I give them a list or tell them what I want, they haven't a clue. My husband does whatever he can to give me something. A gift card is thoughtful enough if I don't give him specifics. We are married 18 years; dated for 27 years. This is how it's always been. It works well. \n\nSo I understand you were disappointed in his lack of perceived effort, but he did put in thought. Gift cards are not personal, but he wanted to treat you to something he knows you like. Buying concert tickets don't take up a lot of effort either, but you saw something you knew he'd really like and got them for him. It was exciting and fun for both of you. It was  a meaningful gift from you. There's very little guesswork as you knew what performer would interest him. \n\nYour specific needs may have been harder for him to pinpoint. Don't put aside that he was trying to do something nice and thoughtful to the best of his ability. Make a list. Add to it. He'd appreciate that.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NAH because I think he did put in some effort by picking a store that relates to your hobby, but I agree that gift cards are, more often than not, a cop out. \n\nI only buy or like receiving gift cards for specific things that otherwise can\u2019t be wrapped up  I like Starbucks, but rarely want to spend that much on coffee, so I appreciate a gift card. I\u2019ll buy restaurant gift cards for my brother and SIL so they can have a date night. This year I got a Chewy gift card towards my cat\u2019s expensive prescription food, which the giver couldn\u2019t buy themselves. Those are all great because they show a good amount of thought was put in. But general gift cards like Amazon just tell me you could t be bothered.", "I am going with NAH...gift cards don't seem thoughtful to me ...but he got you one specific to your hobbies so he did give some thought to it...\n\nAcknowledge this and tell him in general you prefer he stay away from gift cards for the future...I mean you essentially got him gift cards too...it is not like you are playing the concert...you gave him a piece of paper to redeem for something you know he likes...so basically a gift certificate?", "Your post reminded me of a story told by comic Sarah Millican:\nhttps://youtu.be/EyGgNrCwL3E", "NTA. \n\nI've been married for almost 39 years. \n\nMost of the time, my husband doesn't get it right. But it's a small thing. I buy myself what I want. \n\nHe tries, but just doesn't make it. Sometimes even when I tell him exactly what I wanted. But it's a small thing in the whole scheme of our marriage. My husband isn't a good gift giver, and I'm okay with that. I love everything he gives me and enjoy it while treating myself on the side. \n\nYour boyfriend did give you something you can use, correct? You can use it and move on. Is this the first time he's given you something you weren't happy with? If not, then have him start the list again. \n\nIt's the only way you will be happy.", "Man. I love gift cards. That\u2019s all I want for Xmas. Lol.", "NTA. Not everyone likes to get gift cards. I love getting them but again they me. My family including my husband do wishlists on Amazon we include the gift cards we would like on there.", "YTA", "YYA.   Being disappointed on the gift, no issue. However also being upset if he jotted down notes on the iPhone when you mentioned something thru out the the year is an AH move.   Can\u2019t get mad at both him guessing wrong as well as trying to better when you mention something in passing.", "NAH \u2014 some people are just super bad at gifts. I think what matters is communicating how you need to be loved. You should figure out each of your love language! I think it could help you out a lot.\n\nFor example My husband and I forget anniversary gifts every year. This year he got me one thing and it was just ok. I prob won\u2019t use it that often. I got him a few thoughtful things that he seemed to like. Prob did a little better than him this year. but what really matters to me is that he regularly gives me massages all year long. I could care less about gifts on any holiday as long as I\u2019m getting a steady dose of loving touch. For him he needs me to give him lots of genuine, affirming words, which is easier for me than gifts anyway! We try to do well on gifts but usually fail, and we give each other grace because it doesn\u2019t matter too much to us.\n\nBut this will vary by person and by couple a ton. It could be that you are lacking in something else that you need to feel loved (even if that thing isnt better gifts) and that\u2019s making you react strongly to the gift situation.\n\nIf gifts IS your love language, he needs to put some effort into learning how to gift to you better.", "NTA. For me this is less about the gift but his reaction to learning you were disappointed. Calling you a brat and being passive aggressive is AH behavior", "Soft YTA - a gift card to a craft store IS a thoughtful gift. Craft supplies are confusing to people who don't do that craft, and to top it off, not everyone does the same thing the same way. Rather than get you something you might not like and waste his money, he got you something you can actually use. If you want, you can always invite him to shop with you so he can learn more about your crafts and figure out what you want in the future. \n\nI honestly really dislike it when someone gets me something for my crafts because I'm REALLY picky and they usually choose something I don't have *for a reason* \n\nI was SO EXCITED this year because my friend got me a gift card for my birthday -- it's to a woman-owned, small business, plant store he really likes, she does awesome bioactive soil blends. The gift card is enough for me to pick a soil blend that I want, and bonus, he wanted to introduce me to the shop because she's really good about shipping and we live cross country from each other, but he knows I'm really active in my local plant groups and am friends with a couple of greenhouse/shop owners here, so if I like it, I can recommend it to people, and then people here have access to a great soil blends company AND she gets more business. \n\nI really love supporting small businesses, and being the cool person that knows about things early (I'm a loser I know lol), and while I usually do my own soil blends, it saves me a step for some really prissy plants I have so it's like... The most perfect gift for me. A gift card. \n\nObviously you don't have to see it the same way, and you can feel however you want to feel, but I think it's YTA territory to be upset because he got you something you actually do like, just don't want as an Xmas gift", "NTA. I understand that when you are this close to someone, unless you specifically ask for a gift card, you shouldn\u2019t get one. \n\nYTA. BUT he said you like crafting, so he tried to get you something that you would like. As a crafter, I know that certain brands and materials are better than others. This is the only time I will ever accept a GC from my partner because I am very picky about the tools, brands, etc that I use. I know what I like and how to work with those specific brands. \n\nSo instead of getting you something you may not like, or don\u2019t use, he made sure to get you a gift within his range, still make it personal to you, but allow you to get the specifics rather than waste money on something that doesn\u2019t work for your crafting.", "No Assholes Here. When you\u2019re broke, Christmas can really suck. You can\u2019t get the people you love what you would WANT to get them\u2026 and there\u2019s a million and one corporations vying for your nonexistent dollar the whole time. They gave you what they could maybe. And got called out for it. And you\u2019re Not an Asshole for being disappointed, but if you have other reasons to love them, use them. If your needs are being met in the relationship in other ways, sometimes you have to recognize that the other person can\u2019t be responsible for your expectations of them, and noones going to live up to your expectations in EVERY Way. But if this is an incident that indicates a larger issue\u2026 then that\u2019s the issue to address instead", "Haha my son's dad bought him an old school original PS1 controller. Our son doesn't even HAVE a PS1 and the controller won't work on anything else. \n\nWant to know what our son wanted for Christmas? The Xbox one controller my ex STOLE off our son's bed last spring. Reached in the window and took off with a lot of our sons stuff. It's been in a storage unit for the better part of this year. \n\nMy son told me he is going no contact with his dad and I can't blame him. \n\nI understand a gift card if you just have no idea at all. And a gift card is much better than a useless piece of equipment.", "The only acceptable gift card in my opinion is a book one - I use it throughout the year! But I've also got really into sewing/knitting in the last year or so and I think I'd like gift cards to my favourite stores to do with them (which tend to be independents rather than big box)\n\nI do think OP is being a little unreasonable by saying she doesn't want to have to tell him what she wants... People aren't mind readers!!", "I don't mind getting gift cards from extended family. Since they don't see me very often and don't really know what I like, past gifts have missed the mark as far as my interests go. An Amazon gift card means I can get something I genuinely want.\n\n\nBut as you said, that's just me. OP and their partner need to discuss their gift giving/receiving preferences to ensure both parties are happy.", "I think gift cards can be thoughtful in certain circumstances. My sister and BIL just bought a new house and literally all of their extra money is going into the house, and they don\u2019t really get to go on date nights anymore. One of her gifts was a gift card to a nice, nearby restaurant so her and her husband could treat themselves to a date night that they probably wouldn\u2019t have the funds to do otherwise.", "See here's where I get confused. \n\nI've heard people say gift cards are low effort. But to me so is buying off a gift registry. \n\nWhen you buy off a registry or wish list. You aren't picking out the gift. The receiver already has done it. You don't have to think about the person's likes because it's done for you. In fact you could buy the \"perfect gift\" for someone you don't even know that way. \n\nTo me buying a generic use anywhere gift card requires the same amount and thought about a person as buying off a wish list. \n\nOps boyfriend actually took the time to think about Op and get her a gift card to a store that carries things according to her interests. And it's hard to buy the right crafting materials for someone without a project in mind.", "I just think some people aren\u2019t great gift givers, but can be otherwise good partners. If your partner is always giving you gifts that are completely off or not quite what you want, a gift card to a store you normally shop at is so much better than that dance of pretending you love it while giving excuses of why you\u2019re not using it.", "I feel this. My partner put zero effort into the presents he got me this year ( and well, any present, except for one). One present was a replacement for an item he took from me and never gave back. The replacement isn\u2019t as good as the original item. I also got a travel mug with no lid. It\u2019s really hard not to be disappointed especially when I went out of my way for Christmas and his birthday(which was a little over a month ago).", "When people come for advice about craft-specific gifts, many crafters will advise a gift card, because it\u2019s such a personal preference situation.\n\nMany crocheters have stories about being gifted single skeins of sock weight yarn when they like making bulky blankets, or watercolour painters getting entry level paint sets when they use specific brands for pigment/brushes.\n\nI think he could have personalized it more/added something less generic, but if his thought was \u201cshe really wants to craft but needs supplies\u201d, his heart was in the right place.", "But the present wasn\u2019t just a gift card, it was the research he did. And the thinking of your mom.", "That doesn't seem like a particularly creative or high-effort present. You knew he liked a band. He knew you liked crafts. You clicked a couple of times on a website. He went into a store and bought a gift card.", "Name calling is also very easy not to do. If he felt hurt that she didn\u2019t appreciate his shitty little gift card then he could have expressed that respectfully. I\u2019ll never believe that anyone who really loves another would call them a \u201cbrat\u201d. How demeaning and sad.", "Here\u2019s an idea. Go to Amazon and you can make a wish list and make it public so then he can look it up and see what you have listed. That way he isn\u2019t trying to figure out what to buy you", "Same. I love shopping, so to me, gift cards are two gifts in one. I get what I like, AND I get to shop!  I got gift cards to both of my favourite malls this year, and I can\u2019t wait to go use them tomorrow!", "Eh. There is your partner knowing things about what your hobby and knowing what you enjoy about it. Then there is knowing exactly what you need. My hobby\u2019s are orchids and sewing. There is absolutely no way the poor dear could get me anything other than gift cards for either of those two things. He got me a three beautiful Madevallias once, but didn\u2019t realize that those things have a fuck all chance of surviving in my climate. So that was a wasted $150. He tried to get me a new sewing machine once too because I had mentioned mine was getting old. Got me this machine that did embroidery. I don\u2019t do embroidery work on my clothing and don\u2019t ever plan on doing embroidery, he thought I was just limited by my machine. So that was a wasted $1500 (thankfully we we able to return it and I picked up a serger, lol). So now he does gift cards to my favorite orchid nurseries and fabric stores. He knows where I like to shop and that works. For hobbies, and especially crafting, I can easily see how that would be the safest bet for the person to be able to get exact what they need.", "I've tolerated abuse my entire life, my standards are \"doesn't treat me like literal fucking garbage\" but thanks.", "Honestly he's gotten me chocolate before as a present. He shows me he cares everyday. I don't actually need a gift for reassurance. I didn't blow up because he got me chocolate one year and I didn't start gushing because he got the gift card that year. They are just gifts. Irrelevant in the scheme of things. Our relationship doesn't hinder on gifts. If I never got one again it wouldn't make a damn bit of difference. My mum and brother stopped giving gifts to each other as a requirement years ago when my dad died because of how unimportant gifts started to seem during the holidays, birthdays etc. All this nonsense over gifts is just not something I can relate to so maybe I should just bow out of this conversation because clearly it matters far more to others than it does to me.", "I worded myself poorly but obviously that\u2019s not what I meant.

I think less thoughtful would be here's a random gift card for something you have never expressed desire for. Getting a gift card for something she likes shows that it was catered for her just the hairdresser gift card I got was catered for me. Unlike the beauty spa gift card I received that had nothing to do with me at all. The \"thought\" that went into that was she has a vagina so get her something girly. The thought that went into both her partner and my partner's gift was she enjoys this specific thing that's specific to her (not her genitals) and I want her to enjoy it.

If my husband got me a gift certificate to go fabric shopping, I'd be over the moon.
