I have had multiple ideas for his gift for a long time. Originally, I was going to get him tickets to see a band that I knew he loved, but another show was announced at the beginning of December that was coming to our area for the first time so I bought him tickets for that instead. He did know about these tickets before Christmas, because I wanted to make sure I got seats close enough and I didn\u2019t want him to try and buy tickets when I already had them. He is very excited for the show and has thanked me a million times. \n\nSo, I know he is a little tighter on money this month so I wasn\u2019t expecting anything big or extravagant. I opened my gift to find some chocolate and a gift card to a craft store. I tried to hide my disappointment, because I felt like I always try to give him something he will enjoy, and to me a gift card seems like a cop-out. I still thanked him and we continued to cuddle on the couch. Eventually, he noticed I was a little off and asked me about it. I tried to shrug it off because I really don\u2019t want to fight on Christmas, but eventually I did tell him I was a little upset about the gift card.\n \nHere is where I may be TA. I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t put much thought into it, and I always try to give him something he will enjoy. He told me he knows I like crafting, but didn\u2019t know what to get me so thought a gift card would let me pick something I\u2019d like out. He called me a brat and told me I was just upset because the monetary value of my gift was lower than his, which is not true. He used to have a note on his phone where he would keep a list of things I said I want or like for Christmas, but when he got a new phone it was deleted. I also told him that I don\u2019t want to have to tell him what to get me. \n\nNow we\u2019re not really talking and he just keeps passively aggressively saying that he\u2019ll do better next year. I don\u2019t really know what to do or say to fix the situation, and I feel like AH. I didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings by telling him this, but I also was hurt by the seemingly lack of thought. \n\nIf I am TA, please tell me.

It took me 5 years to figure out she is not great at giving gifts.  Ever since I figured this out my Xmasses have been awesome.  \n\nI can not wait to use my giant bottle of grapeseed oil tonight.  I will have the biggest smile on my face making dinner.", "NTA - After your extra info, this should have been just a simple conversation in a relationship about expectations and effort and you felt gift card was a cop-out but he did put thought behind it knowing you like crafts but not knowing what to get you. The reason this is not a NAH is because he called you a brat.", "NTA  You didn't throw a fit or anything, but your partner could tell that they let you down.  Now they are being ridiculous and throwing a tantrum because you were honest.  If they had put some effort in and made you a gift, you would have appreciated the effort, it's not about the cost.  It's that they don't care enough to bother.", "Honestly, I'd have been thrilled with that gift. I love chocolate and crafting so that seems like a pretty sweet deal to me. I actually like it a lot when I'm given a gift card because I like being able to go get stuff I like. \n\nHe wasn't being lazy. He thought about this. He didn't just pick up a quick gift card for a fast food place or something. He got it for something that you like to do. That shows intent and thought so your assuming he just didn't care is probably not too valid. \n\nObviously I don't know how much he spent but to me it would not matter at all. Just the idea that someone thinks of me and gifts me is enough. \n\nI got an open box toaster oven from a pal online. That hasn't arrived as yet but she sent me a little e-card, a pic and the manual and let me know it will be here next week. I didn't expect it and I'm thrilled to actually get a gift from someone else for once. Other than that I had to buy my own holiday gifts. I just don't have a lot of people in my life to give me gifts anymore. \n\nI always appreciated the gifts but it's the people I miss not having these  days. Nobody dear to me to celebrate the holidays with. My folks they died years apart but both between Christmas and New Year's. A good friend also passed this time of year. \n\nI do okay but I keep things in perspective too. At least I'm housed, I have healthcare and I have a small income to depend upon. Two years ago I was broke, sitting in a shelter feeling sorry for myself. Now I'm in my own place and I could afford to buy myself a little gift for Yule. \n\nYou're very lucky to have a guy who loves you. That's a major gift itself. You have a loved one to celebrate the holidays with who  actually cared enough to buy you a gift card and chocolates. That's more than a lot of people. So count your blessings and enjoy them.\n\n:)", "I\u2019m going through a similar situation, but I was the one told I didn\u2019t put enough thought into the gift. \ud83d\udc80 I was thinking about posting my story on here too! \ud83e\udd23 But as a fellow crafter, I would love a gift card bcuz that gives me the option of getting exactly what I want. \n\nHowever, getting only a gift card and chocolates seems like a gift from a friend, not your bf, so I\u2019m going with NTA. \n\nIt does seem like a cop-out gift. Had he added at least 1 more thing that was meaningful to you, I would be on his side, but he didn\u2019t, so I\u2019m on your side.  \n\nIf you\u2019re curious about my situation, I\u2019ll be posting it shortly.", "To me, you are NTA because I think gift cards are a cop out also. \n\nI keep my own list on Amazon. This year my parents and boyfriend all had the list and got me things off of that list. My mom deviated a little bit and bought similar items in the same colors. There was effort made to get me things I like. \n\nI am amazed at how many posts I've seen this morning asking it people are AH for being disappointed. The last one I read about was socks and a GameStop gift card.\n\nGift cards just aren't personal and I'd say family members giving them can often end up with the recipient feeling kinda bummed. \n\nSignificant others giving them...eh. seriously they didn't want to put in the effort imo and I'd be disappointed also. \n\nEveryone is different though. Maybe he really loves gift cards so he can pick what he wants. I think most women expect something thoughtful from their significant other though.", "NTA, but has your boyfriend ever shown a knack for giving meaningful gifts to people in his life? If he has, did those people tell him what to get them, or did he pick it out? \n\nGift giving is a skill. You have to practice it, and you have to observe the person you\u2019re buying for. Then you have to think, consider options, discard some, add others. It comes natural to some, and is completely foreign to others. Consider helping him out. An ongoing Amazon wishlist that you update from time to time. That way he can get you something from the list and be safe, then as he gets comfortable, he can expand and add to what\u2019s on the list with his own initiative.", "Wow, I really disagree with the first commenters here.  You\u2019re NTA.\n\nLike you said, it\u2019s not the monetary value.  But a gift card for someone you\u2019ve been dating a long time doesn\u2019t feel appropriate at all.  It\u2019s a cop-out.  I\u2019d be bummed with a gift card, and so would my partner of two years.  It sends a message of \u201cyeah your gift was kind of a rushed afterthought\u201d, which is a shitty message to receive from your long-time partner on Christmas.", "I hate the tradition of gift giving based on dates and occasions. \n\nChristmas/birthdays/valentines whatever, it all feels like a massive test of relationships between people.", "NTA. A gift card is a zero effort present. It\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s about not recognizing that they should know you well enough to be able to find a meaningful present at any price point.", "You should look up the Love Languages.\n\nI can\u2019t tell if you are truly upset with the gift card, or if you know your relationship is getting stale.\n\nINFO: He used to have a list of things you would like on his phone\u2026 Did he stop because he doesn\u2019t have any money to spend, or because you\u2019re in that phase where you\u2019re bored with each other?", "I know you say it\u2019s not about monetary value, but I\u2019d be upset if it was like 10$ gift card vs 200$ tickets. But if it the sum is comparable, and allows you to actually buy something nice, that\u2019s a very good present imo. \nIf he couldn\u2019t afford a comparable present, he should have told you he\u2019d get the tickets (at least his ticket) himself. \n\nSo, INFO: was the price comparable?", "Idk, I'm a crafter myself, and after the cricut incident I read about on this sub, I'd much rather someone get me a gift card to a craft store than get me something specific I may never use. You may want to try letting him know what your favorite activities are around the holidays so he can pick up something thoughtful without feeling overwhelmed while trying to pick something out. I can understand how someone can think \"oh I'll get my partner knitting needles!\" And then being overwhelmed by the different guage sizes available. \n\nI lean NAH because he /did/ think of you and money was tight for him, and gift giving comes more naturally to some than to others. Gift conversations can be really awkward to have because they put you and your partner on the spot; your partner doesn't want to feel thoughtless and you don't want to feel selfish or ungrateful, and I get that! But if you go about it the right way you'll both understand where the value of gifts comes from for each of you, and he'll feel more prepared to shop for you.", "NTA\n\nHe was lazy and he called you a brat. I don't find it ok to name someone a brat and I would be extremely pissed. To me it's even worse than the bad gift because he's becoming aggressiv while called off for his bad gift.\n\nTo be honest: I find it extremely hard to find gifts for my husband - same for him. So we actively communicate when we don't have ideas, that it would be cool if the other could name some ideas. If not, we COMMUNICATE that there will not be much. Sometimes I have a good idea for him and sometimes he has a good idea for me. We enjoy it then. But we don't put much expectative in it.", "NTA. I would be upset especially if he knew you put thought in. I have always made it clear that the present is really the time and effort you put into trying to do something nice. When a present comes with either an obvious lack of effort, or a comment about it not being a good present, I think it\u2019s reasonable to be upset. That said it\u2019s important you tell him how you feel about it. \n\nFor years my husband would either not buy me anything at all or put it such a half arsed effort it seemed more insulting than nothing. I clearly articulated (admittedly repeatedly) the problems this was causing (or perhaps reflecting) and this year he bought me a very cheap but very thoughtful gift. I loved it. It\u2019s really not the money it\u2019s the effort. \n\nI hope you guys can sort it out. I think saying something and a good thing, communication is necessary in longer term relationships.", "I feel like you both kind of suck. Yeah a gift card doesn\u2019t seem super thoughtful but making it into comparison shopping (my gift good his gift bad) feels like there\u2019s more than the gift at play here. He may very well embarrassed as heck but that doesn\u2019t excuses his resentful snapping (oth what can he say here? once the fight started I\u2019m not sure how anyone wins).\n\nYou know, you both suck is way too harsh- what I mean is you seem to suck at each other. Like this just doesn\u2019t seem like a happy relationship.", "I say NAH. Not everyone is good at gifts, that's just a fact, I personally would much rather a gift card than something I wouldn't use but no matter what I get I'm going to be grateful for it.", "NTA \nMy story fyi from decades back for a laugh. Ex bf wanted me to have a 35mm camera so I could photograph his band. I didn't want one and before my July birthday told him it wasn't for me. My birthday came; no gift, just song and dance about a delay. Months go by; no gift. Christmas we went to his mother's- and there's a gift for me. Crudely wrapped, no box or case, a clearly used 35mm camera. He got his ex's baby a cute sweater though, and spent half an hour talking to her on the phone.\nThe end was nigh.", "well I'm sick of this. What ever happened to gratitude?", "NTA It\u2019s not unreasonable to want your partner of all people to come up with a more thoughtful gift. If he\u2019s around you that often, he would probably know what type of crafting you do like or could come up with a ton of other gift ideas. I try to reserve gift cards for people I don\u2019t spend as much time with. While gift cards can still be a thoughtful gift, not necessarily for your partner.", "Info: what in your opinion makes what you got for him more thoughtful than what he got for you?", "YTA.  He did put thought into your gift.  He knew you enjoyed crafting and got you something so you could get what you wanted/needed to do it.", "YTA. He knew what you liked but didn\u2019t know where to start with getting you something, so he gave you something that would allow you to pick for yourself. I would much prefer someone give me a gift card to a place they know I like if they\u2019re unsure what I would like from there, and it\u2019s childish and immature to think he didn\u2019t put any thought into it. He clearly did as he recalled this place is somewhere you like going for your crafts.", "Info: Did you say to him that you try to get him things he would enjoy or is that just context for here?", "YTA. The only appropriate response to a gift is \"thank you\". No sulking. No obvious attempts to draw concern from him when you are disappointed in the materialistic aspect of this holiday. \n\nAlso, you do a lot of mental gymnastics to convince yourself that you tried to avoid a conflict. But you didn't. You \"tried\" to hide your disappointment. You felt his gift was \" a cop out\". You \"tried to shrug it off but eventually told him you were upset\". You didn't actually try to avoid this conflict at all. It is in your best interest to stop lying to yourself about that.\n\nYou were ungrateful. You were counting up the value of his gift. You pouted noticably enough that you could draw him into a conversation about it. You manipulated that interaction. You are being a brat in more ways than one.", "YTA because 1) your bf seems to have been legitimately unsure of what you would like most for crafting so got you a gift card for a place you like to shop but mostly because 2) you want him to read your mind. Super lame IMO to say \"I don't want to have to tell you what to get me.\" You reap what you sow. Either give him a list and be happy you got something you liked or forgo the list and risk disappointment. I personally think giving a list is a nice gesture to help the other person.\n\nAlso, getting a gift card is great. Who doesn't like to shop on someone else's dime? Why not try to see the bright side?", "ESH: You need to be more clear with your expectations in the future.  He probably thought he did good even though it was a lazy way to go about it.", "YTA.  The only appropriate response to any gift is \"thank you.\" If you're obsessed with effort or price being \"even,\" you need to do some growing up before you try to have a relationship.", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA. You\u2019re saying is not about the $ value but it sounds like it is. Christmas isn\u2019t supposed to be about what you get or who can spend the most. I would apologize.", "YTA I cannot imagine being in my 20s and complaining about a gift card. You don\u2019t want to tell him what to get but the guy isn\u2019t a mind reader.", "YTA, everyone is different when it comes to gift giving. Some (like myself) are naturally good at picking out thoughtful gifts and plan far ahead. Other's are just terrible and do most of their shopping in a last minute panic. If you get upset over this you will always be upset. Instead you need to clearly communicate what you want and like, help people improve on their gift giving. I was actually suprised by myself this year, I thought I hadn't planned something for my husband (I bought concert tickets for february so a big gift was already covered) but in my gift box in the closet (yes, I'm one of those that stock up on gifts ahead of time when there are sales and special offers) I found some small but very thoughtful things for him. I got a book of this years Noble prize winner (which I always get). I'm still happy. We're different.", "YTA. If you do enjoy crafting, it is better to have a gift card for that than to have him pick out things you may not want or need. And if you don't think you should have to tell him what to get you, how is this man ever going to get you something you'll be happy with or want?\n\nLiterally every year I get asked by family what I want. Most of the time I only ask for things I need. Because I have most of what I want. If there's something, I mention it. If someone gets me something I didn't ask for, I still appreciate it. They didn't have to get me anything, but they chose to.", "NTA. He put 0 thoughts into your gift, pressured you to talk about it when you tried to move past it AND then had the right to blame you. Huge red flag on his side tbh\n\n\nEdit: also, he *had* a list on his old phone and he didn't bother remembering something from the list? Does he care that little?", "YTA. It's always an AH move to be snotty over a gift.  Every time.  It's a gift. Gratitude is a good look on everyone.", "I'm going with ESH. I understand that you're disappointed because a gift card feels impersonal, but it's also rude to act ungrateful when someone gives you a gift. I think you should both apologize and move past it.", "Slight YTA. Some people just aren\u2019t that great at getting gifts. My husband is kind of the same way, but I dont take it personally because I know its the thought that counts. You\u2019re just upset because you dont think he put the same amount of thought into the gift that you did.", "YTA wish lists exist for a reason if you\u2019re are hoping for something specific then you need to say so.\nBut if someone takes the time to get a gift for you then IMO you should be thankful.", "If someone wants to give me a gift related to knitting, I'd much rather have a gift card to pick out my own yarn rather than have yarn I don't want.\n\nI'm not sure if he's being passive aggressive. I think he's being berated and is saying that he'll do better next year.\n\nYou say money is tight, so a gift card to a craft store is practical. He won't waste money on cheap junk and you'll still be able to get crafting supplies, which would be harder to buy with limited funds.\n\nYTA", "\u201cI know he is a little tighter on money this month so I wasn\u2019t expecting anything big or extravagant\u2026 (He) told me I was just upset because the monetary value of my gift was lower than his, which is not true\u201d\n\nWait, so you also didn\u2019t get him anything expensive or special? He told you something affordable he wanted and was very thankful for it. Then he tried to get you a gift he thought was relevant to your interest and missed. Not a big deal either way.\n\nIf you get a gift you don\u2019t love from someone that you know loves you, you don\u2019t have to pretend to love the gift, just let the person know even if your disappointed in the gift, you love them and that\u2019s more important. People can be insecure when giving gifts and it\u2019s always ideal to be frateful when you know intentions are good. I suspect you didn\u2019t handle it quite like this and he now thinks you love him less. And if you do love him less for not going big when money was tight, well that\u2019s far worse but I assume this was just a case of miscommunication.\n\nEither way, YTA, but not a huge one. This can be trivially fixed with an honest conversation. Merry Christmas", "YTA send me the card I would use it. I got nothing for xmas.  At least he thought about you.

For me, Christmas is not about giving gifts, so I really don't understand comparing gifts in any way. But - lots of people do, apparently.  Your feelings are your feelings.\n\nKnowing a lot of men, many of them freak out at gift-giving time as they know there is a LOT of pressure to pick the perfect gift.  They panic or pick something they think will be appreciated and get shit on for any number of reasons.  Many simply say screwit, I'll get a get card so at least she can pick something I know she'll like.  THAT's a thoughtful gift. He's trying not to pick the WRONG gift and risking getting blasted, or not living up to some unrealistic expectation.  His reaction is more likely from feeling like you think he's thoughtless or cheap or a combination.  If I were him I'd be upset, too.  I've seen this in people I know and it's brutal to watch.\n\nBut - you can feel however you feel because it's how you think.  You can't stop that.  But - he can also feel hurt, resentful, embarassed, upset.. all of the things that come with someone telling them they're thoughtless.

I say this because you said he said he wasn\u2019t sure what craft things to buy you so got you a voucher to where you buy things from.

Even if he kept the receipt incase it was the wrong thing so you could exchange it. But I do get your feeling of disappointment after putting the amount of thought into his as you did. Unfortunately as others have said, some are just not very good at gift giving. Your boyfriend at least remembered a store you like which shows he at least pays some attention", "Effort is the present you wanted. NTA.", "Ok this is hard for me because in my relationship I am the bad gift giver. But I do put weeks or months stressing about what to get my partner, and sometimes I get so nervous about getting them something they won\u2019t like that I panic and get them something like an IOU or a gift card. And I always feel bad about it because I know they hate those - but if I don\u2019t get something that they want they will be disappointed as well. What I ended up having to do is tell them that if they aren\u2019t specific with me, they are likely to be disappointed, even though I try really hard. So if they don\u2019t want to be bummed about my gift that have to tell me what they want. \n\nCommunication goes both ways, so I am going to go with ES. I know a lot of people don\u2019t like gift cards, so I kind of don\u2019t blame you, but he got you a card to a place he knows you like - so he did put thought into what you could want - probably more than you think he did. If he\u2019s anything like me he probably tried to figure out something to get you from the store, got overwhelmed with the idea of getting you something bad and panicked. That is a lot of thought. A lot of stressful thinking. So some appreciation would be nice. That being said he\u2019s not exactly being understanding of your perspective and he called you a brat. So he sucks. \n\nI\u2019d work on communicating - If you wanted something more specific and you knew that he\u2019d lost his list, I would have taken the time to help him recreate the list, and he should ask for help if he needs it.", "NTA getting a teenager a gift card is fine. Getting the person you\u2019re meant to know best a gift card is a cop out.", "NTA I\u2019ve been there. Xmas, birthday, anniversary- these days aren\u2019t a surprise. They fall on the same date, every year. Aside from an unexpected illness or expenses, there really is no good excuse for last minute shopping by a significant other. For a SO a good gift is thoughtful, personal, and specific - I love you, I know you, and your happiness matters to me. That\u2019s what it means when people say it\u2019s the thought that counts. Not that they remembered to get you a gift at all, but that they thought about you specifically and what would make you smile. \n\nFeel how you feel. And if that is disappointed, then get curious about that. Sometimes that happens, and an honest conversation can clear things up. BUT If you tell your SO that you are hurt by something they\u2019ve done, and they reply by being passive aggressive, and you\u2019re now worried about hurting their feelings by being hurt..maybe get curious about that dynamic too.", "Thank you for your comment. I think I\u2019m going to have to do the same. I feel awful, but you\u2019re right. It\u2019s who he is and I still love him. At least he\u2019s trying", "Lmao", "Thank you for your comment. I really appreciate your insight here. I guess I felt like the lack of effort (that I assumed) was a reflection of how he felt about me. We have been going through a slight rough patch so I know I am sensitive and extremely insecure right now. He explained that he didn\u2019t want to get me something I wouldn\u2019t use or like, but I had a hard time shaking the feeling that he didn\u2019t think enough about what to get me because he doesn\u2019t care. You are right, though. I am very lucky to have people who love me to spend the holidays with. I hope you have a great holiday season, too!", "Thank you. Yes, absolutely! One of my favourite gifts from him was a $5 stuffed turtle he gave me before I took my first big trip for professional development. It was a dorky, \u201ccheap\u201d gift but it meant the world to me and I still keep it in my car for travelling. \n\nI hope your situation also sorts itself out!", "I think gift cards are one of those things where the person has to be into them. I was always fine with (and asked for) gift cards for book stores so I could purchase my own books as things I liked came out, but any other gift card was kinda \"I guess I have to find something from there then\". I also tend to think of unasked for gift cards as the ultimate \"I had no ideas and gave up\" gift lol.", "What's the difference between buying something off your Amazon list and sending you an Amazon gift card for you to pick something out? In both cases they're just giving you money for Amazon to get what you choose. The only difference is who fills out the checkout form.", "If my partner knew I liked a place but didn\u2019t know what to get for me from there, I would still be ecstatic that he remembered I liked the place at all. The only correct response to a gift is \u201cthank you,\u201d especially one where the other is uncertain and goes with a safe bet.\n\nIt\u2019s free money with the thought of \u201cThey can buy whatever they want from this place and make sure they get something they like,\u201d which is pretty spectacular.", "I super disagree with your gift card take. I\u2019m a huge crafter, and what I need and what quantity is something even I don\u2019t always know until I get into a project, a gift card is really the most thoughtful thing you can get me without explicitly asking what I want. \n\nThe only issue here is that OP expected \u201cbetter\u201d, but it\u2019s hard for me to really see where he went wrong. OP explicitly says they didn\u2019t want boyfriend asking what to get them, so if boyfriend was going the crafting route, asking explicitly what supplies to get sounds like it was also out of the question. OP is entitled to their feelings, but honestly I think they probably overreacted on this one.", "Thank you for your comment. I do have a list on Amazon, although he did not think to look at it. He said he didn\u2019t know what things I needed for my crafting so this way I could pick out what I needed. I know he was trying to be thoughtful, but after being with someone for this long it feels a little shitty.", "I feel like it\u2019s very specific to the situation. I got my younger sister a $50 gift card to ULTA because she loves makeup and mentioned that she wants to replace several things from her collection, and she is very very particular. She was super excited because she loves shopping and specifically wanted to shop around. \n\nBut if she had asked for a specific palette or blush or something, I would have bought that. When the gift idea is vague like \u201cmakeup\u201d but not specific, a gift card is sometimes better than getting them something you aren\u2019t sure they will like. \n\nBut if they ask for something specific, it\u2019s your job to buy that item or something close to it if you want them to like the gift. \n\nNTA here at all btw. It\u2019s totally reasonable to have expected your partner to put more thought into the gift he got you. It isn\u2019t about the monetary value, it\u2019s about the thought that goes into the gift. Your partner didn\u2019t really put much thought beyond \u201coh she likes to craft\u201d which is surface level info at best. A partner should know you better and know at least ONE THING you are wanting that they could have made the effort to get.", "Thank you for your comment. We\u2019ve been together for almost 6 years, so yeah, it felt a little rushed. I know he only went shopping earlier this week. I still feel awful for being disappointed, but it hurts with the lack of effort. I have mentioned things, have things on an Amazon wish list, and have expressed that I don\u2019t like the idea of having to pick out my own gift. I really don\u2019t care about the monetary value at all", "I will. I know I\u2019m a gift giver, so I have tried to monitor my own expectations when receiving gifts and keep this in mind. \n\nIt\u2019s not about money, I really don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a $10 gift or $100 gift. Unfortunately, when he got a new phone a lot of his information didn\u2019t transfer so he didn\u2019t have access to it anymore. But honestly, I don\u2019t know. We have been through a bit of a rough patch recently but I thought we were coming through. Thank you for your comment.", "No, the price was not comparable. Although, like I said, I really do not care about that. When I bought the tickets I knew they would be more than he would (probably) have to spend on me, but that\u2019s ok. It was more about the amount of thought.", "Thank you very much for your comment. I totally understand why he would get a gift card and I just have a different opinion on giving those as gifts as he does. I have other hobbies and interests that he knows of and some that he\u2019s involved in, but I will do a better job of giving him ideas in the future.", "The show I bought him tickets for is about something he\u2019s been really passionate about for almost his entire life. It\u2019s something he invests a lot of time into and has kept up on for years. Because it\u2019s the first time it\u2019s coming to our area, I knew that he was excited at the possibility of going so I wanted to give that to him. Although I enjoy crafting and appreciate him trying to give me some flexibility with how I use his gift, it felt like he gave up with coming up with other ideas. There\u2019s lots of other things I\u2019m interested in or enjoy, of course the same can be said about him, but I felt like he didn\u2019t take time to think about what to actually get me.", "disagree-an actual gift you've put thought into, bought, wrapped and have ready to give and ready to use/enjoy is thoughtful- a voucher us an IOU that says I can't be bothered seeing you enjoy an actual guft on the day. It's a 'lastminute.com' cop-out.", "I did not tell him that in the conversation, no. It was just for context.", "Your logic is way off. If you read Reddit a bit, you'll know about eg the girl with an eating disorder given bathroom scales by her dad as a 'gift' or the wife given a trip where everyone in the party were to fly 1st class but hateful MIL put her alone in economy. No, some people can be crueller with 'gifts' than with words. Sometimes the answer to a 'gift' is to call it into question.", "Thank you for your comment. No, it is not about the money spent at all. I truly do not care about that. I felt like I was an afterthought, and that is what upset me. I have since apologized and tried to move on.", "Agree.  YTA.\nAlso- side note- people gotta stop hating on gift cards, they are the bomb.", "Thank you for your comment. We have had conversations about things like this before. I have tried to communicate what I like and things I would enjoy, but it doesn\u2019t always get through. I think I\u2019m like you and I have always enjoyed giving gifts and it comes naturally, I know it does not to him. He went shopping 3 days ago, and I know he had other gifts planned before that for other people. I do have a wish list on Amazon, have mentioned little things here and there, so I guess I just feel unheard.", "I have told him other things I would like, have a wish list on Amazon, and he could have asked me if he didn\u2019t have any ideas. He didn\u2019t look at my list, ask, or write down/remember any of the things I said. I just felt more like an afterthought I guess. I have apologized. Thank you for your comment", "It sounds like he did put thought into it. She sulked and absolutely is ungrateful. Gift giving is difficult for people, he probably thought really hard about it and landed on a craft gift card. I know many people who would be over the moon with a craft gift card.", "You\u2019re right. I know he isn\u2019t a big gift-giver, but It was the amount of thought given that was upset me. Thank you", "Thank you. I do have wish lists on Amazon, which he has access to as he uses my Prime account. He didn\u2019t look at them. I am still thankful for the gift, which is why I tried to move on but unfortunately, couldn\u2019t hide my feelings well enough.", "Thank you.

I rather save the money. I sometimes suggest to people that they donate to a charity in my name, I do love that. \n\nGifting might not be some peoples love language. I usually make a list of approved presents which I hand over for my other half to pick from. \n\nNAH", "Probably no real difference except I told them all that these were items I wanted. My mom bought different items in similar colors.

So it does depend on the person and circumstance - but the point of gifts is knowing what the person you're buying for likes.", "Guess it depends on each person individually. Gift cards are grossly impersonal imo and don't want one from my significant other. I don't think they're wrong to be disappointed by this at all.", "I agree with you. I'm (I guess) in the minority that love getting gift cards. It gives me the chance to get exactly what I want or need.", "Huh, I'd feel completely the opposite.

Secondly, unless you forbid him to ask you what you wanted,  he could have said he deleted/lost the list of gifts you wanted (? he really could not remember a single item?) and asked you what you'd like.

I received too many presents I have no use for, lol!", "[deleted]", "Ok. I guess I\u2019ve always felt that if you\u2019re that worried someone will already have bought the thing you\u2019re getting them, it\u2019s kinda by default a pretty obvious/uncreative gift. \n\nWhich by no means makes it a *bad* gift, lots of people love getting stuff like that.

He should have asked you again when he lost the list.", "Deciding that I will get a book from the latest Noble prize winner was a great idea. I get a book but don't know which. And my husband knows where to start looking. At least you did get a gift card from a craft store. Even if he panicked last minute he did still get you something that is an interest of your's.

To be transparent, I feel like the lack of thought was a reflection of how he cares about me so I was trying to deal with those emotions, too. I appreciate your insight.", "Your OP sounded like your gift given was less than his gift given. Not that important here.\n\nI hate HATE gift cards. But some of the kindest most loving people I know see no problem with them. Don\u2019t hold it against them. Don\u2019t make them insecure. Don\u2019t create wedges.
