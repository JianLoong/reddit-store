{"id": 28162, "submission_id": "16z2chl", "title": "AITA For going to college at my cousin's dream school even though he didn't get in?", "selftext": "Throw away account. The title is pretty clear. I don't think I'm in the wrong, but I could use a second opinion because I'm getting really annoyed with the drama. \n\nBasic context, I (18f) just got into a really good college. I'm there right now, sitting on my dorm room bed typing this. I have a cousin (18m) that also wanted to attend this particular school. He'd been talking about it since we were in middle school. He was absolutely positive he would get in, but didn't. \n\nSupposedly, my cousin had a full on freak out when he got rejected, but I wasn't there for that. He got his email a few days before I got mine. My parents were overjoyed that I'd gotten in, and with a big scholarship, but as soon as my uncle, aunt, and cousin heard, they jumped on me immediately. Calls, texts, showing up to my parents house uninvited, trying to convince me to give my spot to my cousin. He was livid that I was accepted but he wasn't. I told him it was probably because I had a bunch of extracurriculars and he didn't because he thought they were a \"waste of valuable study time\". He said I didn't work as hard as him or get as good of grades as him and didn't deserve to go to this college but he couldn't. I told him tough shit, that's life, and he screamed that I'd probably just drop out anyways because I won't be able to handle it like he would. It got to the point that I just left my phone off and exclusively used my laptop for about a week because they wouldn't stop bugging me. Once they figured out they wouldn't get me to give my cousin my acceptance (because I literally can't, that's not how acceptance works) they started trying to convince me to go to a different school. Since apparently this one \"can't actually be all that good if they couldn't even recognize a talented and smart person like my cousin\". And that I'd probably be much happier at some other school. \n\nThis went on until the day I left for school three weeks ago. The day I left my cousin actually came to my parents house just before I left and told me flat out that if I really went through with this we weren't family anymore because he \"doesn't want to be related to someone that would be so willing to steal his dreams\" (actual quote). I told him okay and got in my car. Now I'm all set up in my dorm, my roommate is fun as heck, classes are going well, and I'm really happy. My cousin still keeps posting angsty junk on his Instagram about dreams being false and hard work being BS that doesn't get you anywhere. It's annoying. \n\nSo what do you guys think? Should I have gone to a different school? AITA?", "created_utc": 1696364511, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16z2chl/aita_for_going_to_college_at_my_cousins_dream/", "score": 365, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They\u2019re losing touch w reality. \nNTA.", "NTA\n\nHow could you possibly be an asshole for going to a school your cousin didn't get into?

Your cousin went over the top here - I get that it must have sucked for him to lose the chance to attend his dream school like that, but you didn't \"steal\" his spot and if you didn't go they would have given your spot to a stranger, not to him.  \n\nIt's fine for you to try to be sensitive and not rub it in your cousin's face that you got to go to his dream school, but that's not what you're doing.  He needs to pull his head out of his ass and make the most of wherever he DID get in.\n\nPS: It's \"waste\" of time, no wonder he didn't get in ;)", "NTA. And he\u2019s right, you aren\u2019t family. Not because you \u201cstole\u201d his dreams but because he and his family can\u2019t just be happy for you. You didn\u2019t take anything from him. You earned it and he didn\u2019t.", "OMG, Just block him on everything. NTA.\n\nHis parents deluded him to think that grades were everything. They sold him the idea that as long as worked hard at school, he'd get into his preferred college. While that can be true for some colleges, others like to see that you were able to do things outside of school, like volunteer, extracurriculars, etc. He can't be mad at you that he didn't get in (well he can, be it's misdirected).\n\nI'm not sure why your parents didn't put an end to this behavior immediately.", "NTA.

Graduate top of your class and rub it in his jealous AH face.", "NTA - how would you be able to give up your spot for your cousin? Unless you have some pull at the university, I don't think you giving up your seat is going to ensure your cousin gets in. His email didn't say he was on a waitlist either, he was rejected. Your cousin is being an AH but I can kinda make space for how your cousin in reacting, he's still youngish and college is a major milestone. Your uncle and aunt though, looks like immaturity has no age limits. They need to be helping your cousin deal with his emotions better instead of hounding you. Good thing you said goodbye to his idiotic ass and went where you wanted to be. Congratulations.", "NTA - what a whiny baby he is!  Shoot for the moon, you might land among the stars.

NTA\n\nCousin needs to grow up. He didn\u2019t get into the school he wanted. Not the first person nor will he be the last person this happens to.

I just mentioned that their strengths might be in doubt. \"You might not be as great as you think you are?\" Many things are weighed in the admissions process. But, sometimes people have to accept that others are actually worthier.\n\nEven if you rejected their admission - there was certainly no way they'd backhand it to your cousin, after all. Instead judging you and praying for failure they should reevaluate what he needs to be successful.\n\nsigh. This is so ridiculous to me. \"When I am disappointed in myself, I blame me. You should try it. Then you can change into a better person and a useful adult.\"\n\nNTA. No matter what you said, this all was really unnecessary for them to harass you with. \"You might be a rock star pal. But, first, they have to get in.\" CONGRATULATIONS, btw.", "NTA.  Why would you crash your future for something that has nothing to do with you?  If you declined to go to your school, the likelihood that the next person in line was your cousin is 0%.  He would have been notified he was wait-listed.  Maybe block your cousin on IG.", "NTA.  You need to stop looking at your cousin's Instagram account. He's bitter and delusional, as is anyone who thinks he could and should have just slid into your spot -even if you wanted to - and that you should give up your school just because he can't go. \n\nThe immature tantrum is even more proof the school made a wise choice not to accept him. He didn't even apply to another school, did he? Good luck in mommy's basement, howling at the moon.", "\"and told me flat out that if I really went through with this we weren't family anymore\"\n\nThe only proper response is \"Okay.

NTA enjoy college and please please graduate with the highest honours you can to really rub it in!", "NTA!!! What a delulu bunch! Definitely cut contact! It's absolutely insane to think that college places are transferable! He can't be that smart if he thinks that! He's the cause of his own problems! \n\nYou enjoy college and soak up all that new knowledge and have a good time, don't waste your time or energy thinking about them!", "NTA\n\nI mean, I want to call this fake, because I can't believe anyone  (cousin/aunt/uncle) are this stupid to act this way.  \n\nLike you said... if you turned it down, he wouldn't suddenly get in. Most schools have waitlists.  He got rejected;  not wait listed.", "NTA. Sounds like his dream school saw he was too immature to be a student there. Good luck and enjoy the experience. I'm a long-time ticket holder on the old petty train. Come on board by making sure he and his equally childish parents hear about every good grade and every great experience you have. It's called salt in an open wound. LOL", "WTF, they actually thought you could give you spot to him!! What were his grades and test scores like, was it good enough to get in or did he fall short there as well?   Did he get into any other college or is he just sitting at home crying like a spoiled little boy.  Flood your social media with how well you are doing and how great it is there.  Let your classmates know about his page.  They can have some fun with it (just don't do it yourself).", "WOW!!\nAbsolutely, positively NTA.\nBest of luck to you. Have a blast and graduate with that degree. \nYour cousin and his parents are ridiculous.

Don't listen to them.  NTA", "NTA. You got in, you have a right to go.\n\nThough I agree that it's dumb that someone can be rejected by a university because they don't play the bagpipes or something, like you need to do that to study any non-music related subject.", "Absolutely NTA you are allowed to go and do whatever you want to do. It\u2019s incredibly selfish what your cousin and family is doing. The best advice is to study hard and do well. They\u2019ll get over it and if they don\u2019t, fuck em. \n\nSimilarly, my bff growing up and I lost our friendship over choosing schools. We had always said we\u2019d go to the same state school and I had the opportunity to go to a way nicer college out of state so I took it. She took it personally and stopped being my friend. It sucked but I know I didn\u2019t do anything wrong or hurtful.", "NTA - Your cousin is utterly delusional.", "NTA. \n\nWhy would you? You earned a place in a good school, with a \"big scholarship\", as you said. He did not. Did you ask him why not? Why was he not good enough to earn his place with that scholarship? This is on him.\n\nI hope you'll thrive. I hope you can do the work to be the best version of yourself, while enjoying being at that prestigious school. Remember: The best revenge is a good life. You'll go there, I'm sure. You got it.\n\nHe can go pound sand. I mean, having his parents to go over to your place to try to prevent you to go to the school you wanted to go to... that's shabby.", "By any chance, is your aunt, uncle, and cousin\u2019s surname Dursley? Because all three sound infantile,  deluded and stupid.", "He probably did not get in because his attitude sucks and his parents did not help for sure.", "NTA\n\nFirst congrats! I hope your first semester us off to a good start!\n\nSecond, I have a feeling if you were a boy none of this would be an issue. It's giving very \" some woman stole my spot\" 1950s vibes. Or \" that person of color took my job\", although POC wouldn't be the word of choice if you catch my drift. \n\nI bet nothing is his fault, every success is deserved, and anything he wants should be his. I hope he cries about it and grows the heck up. No one needs family like that.", "In no way, shape, or form should you be required to mess up your life because someone else didn't get to do something. No chance.

No idea why you should put your life and prospects on hold because he didn't. Sorry about your cousin's luck, he should have worked harder.

LOL. The college will just admit the next on the list. \n\nThey just want to punish you becuase he couldn't hack it, and that is total BS. What in the patriarchy is going on here? Reading between the lines, I'd say they don't want him to feel insecure by always being compared to your (much-higher) accomplishments - so they are trying to bully you into taking a lesser pathway than him, in order to guarantee his relative success. Go show them there is no comparison. \n\nThey are unnecessarily competitive and bitter, poor them. They should feel genuinely happy for your accomplishment, but if they can't put their own disappointment aside, well that is their own burden to bear.

The title is pretty clear. I don't think I'm in the wrong, but I could use a second opinion because I'm getting really annoyed with the drama. \n\nBasic context, I (18f) just got into a really good college. I'm there right now, sitting on my dorm room bed typing this. I have a cousin (18m) that also wanted to attend this particular school. He'd been talking about it since we were in middle school. He was absolutely positive he would get in, but didn't. \n\nSupposedly, my cousin had a full on freak out when he got rejected, but I wasn't there for that. He got his email a few days before I got mine. My parents were overjoyed that I'd gotten in, and with a big scholarship, but as soon as my uncle, aunt, and cousin heard, they jumped on me immediately. Calls, texts, showing up to my parents house uninvited, trying to convince me to give my spot to my cousin. He was livid that I was accepted but he wasn't. I told him it was probably because I had a bunch of extra curriculars and he didn't because he thought they were a \"waist of valuable study time\". He said I didn't work as hard as him or get as good of grades as him and didn't deserve to go to this college but he couldn't. I told him tough shit, that's life, and he screamed that I'd probably just drop out anyways because I won't be able to handle it like he would. It got to the point that I just left my phone off and exclusively used my laptop for about a week because they wouldn't stop bugging me. Once they figured out they wouldn't get me to give my cousin my acceptance (because I literally can't, that's not how acceptance works) they started trying to convince me to go to a different school. Since apparently this one \"can't actually be all that good if they couldn't even recognize a talented and smart person like my cousin\". And that I'd probably be much happier at some other school. \n\nThis went on until the day I left for school three weeks ago. The day I left my cousin actually came to my parents house just before I left and told me flat out that if I really went through with this we weren't family anymore because he \"doesn't want to be related to someone that would be so willing to steal his dreams\" (actual quote). I told him okay and got in my car. Now I'm all set up in my dorm, my roommate is fun as heck, classes are going well, and I'm really happy. My cousin still keeps posting angsty junk on his Instagram about dreams being false and hard work being BS that doesn't get you anywhere. It's annoying. \n\nSo what do you guys think? Should I have gone to a different school? AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When I applied to college, I got into one that several of my friends with slightly better grades were rejected at.  I had not only had good grades, but I also played sports, joined different clubs and did a ton of volunteer work.  Colleges have no need for people who are not well rounded.  It is a fight to get these spots and they will pick the best candidates.  Good job!", "NTA. You worked hard for this. Does your family not realize how different universities would be if people could just give away their spot to whomever they choose?", "This is absolutely ridiculous. Admissions doesn\u2019t work like that. You got in because of the unique set of characteristics that you brought to the admissions team. They selected you. They rejected him. It\u2019s not like you have a golden ticket that you can transfer to someone else.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry that you have such self-centered, entitled, and ridiculous assholes for a family.

Don\u2019t come knocking on my door when you need shit.", "Of course you're NTA.  That would be your cousin, having a fit because the chickens have come home to roost.\n\nYour cousin sounds like a guy I know.  Stupidly, insanely intelligent, 160 IQ, learned everything instantly, could understand the most complex of topics just absurdly fast.  Also felt that all that mattered was intelligence, so he never did sports, never got into scouting, never joined any clubs, never tried to do anything in church or in town.  Life was just school, books, and games.  And his grades weren't even THAT good, considering how smart he was.  His ACT and SAT scores, well, they were phenomenal...and he still got rejected from everything better than the lower-tier of the two major state universities.  And for nearly thirty years, he blamed it on the colleges, not him doing fuck-all in high school.  Today, he's still just coasting along, half-assing his way through life, complaining, like your friend, that work and applying yourself don't matter for shit.\n\nSounds like you're going to do WAY better than your cousin and the guy I know.", "NTA, I would be petty and post pictures of you at the school as a reply to all his emo posts.   \u201cDreams do come true to people who work hard!

If the school knows ahead of time that they wanted you to give up your admission, then tried to convince you it\u2019s not a good school, to trying to talk you into going somewhere else and showing up to your home and  verbally harass you, they won\u2019t take any complaint from them seriously.   \n\n\nI hate to think like that but they are unhinged. They\u2019re going to try to mess this up for you.", "NTA. Also, just from the title i guessed you were female and cousin male. Also, hes an idiot and his family is worse. Enjoy uni and good luck!", "NTA. You\u2019re not responsible for your cousin\u2019s education, and any failure on his part to get in is on him or the school. He can reapply, take a gap year and get more life experience, do some maturing. But he can\u2019t honestly blame you for his not getting in just because you applied. I mean, did you apply for the same program as him? Do you have the exact same backgrounds and focuses? A lot of schools dole out spots to different departments, less popular departments might have more available slots for incoming students, and there\u2019s always going to be a certain number of general student slots as well. If all the general slots and department slots for the department he went for were taken up by better applicants, he\u2019s out of luck.\n\nAlso, your cousin\u2019s behavior indicates he wouldn\u2019t handle college well, especially in a competitive or rigorous program. So your school probably dodged a bullet by denying him.", "NTA. I see why his dream school rejected him. He is and his family are absolute idiots if he thinks you can give your college admission to him. Better off without assholes like that in your life. Your cousin and his family are pathetic and they should be embarrassed for acting like that. Shame those assholes.", "NTA. Does your cousin not understand that he might be able to transfer in after a year elsewhere?", "You didn't \"steal\" anything from your cousin. It would've been great if you both had gotten accepted, but that didn't happen. However, your acceptance doesn't preclude your cousin from being accepted, and you cannot trade spots even if you wanted to. You did nothing wrong.\n\nYour cousin and his parents are unfortunately very misguided. However, it's not the end of the world and there are other schools.

Two were finishing up year 12 and many want to attend a certain uni in our state, whether not they hold the best course for the unit in which gives them the advantage for job industry they want to go in. \n\nIt turned out that this uni had a terrible reputation for the course unit my youngest wanted to do, but he had the qualifying marks to apply and get in.  My sister\u2019s eldest did not and the only uni she wanted to go to was the mentioned.  Cue a flood load of advice from concerned grandparents and my sister, trying to tell me how unsuited this uk would be for our son.  The kicker\u2026..  They didn\u2019t even know what course unit he was interested in.  Only that he not apply so not to upset his cousin.  Meanwhile when our eldest child went through the same process, no one from the family cared where he could attend.\n\nI just reamed them out telling them to mind their own business.  Our child had the marks to apply to any uni with our state and get accepted.  Which meant the one his cousin wanted to attend.  That he will apply to the best uni that conducted the course units he was chasing to do.  His cousins feelings don\u2019t even come into it and should he choose that uni, then she will need to deal with her own emotions properly instead of trying to torpedo my sons future livelihood.\n\nThat went down like a lead balloon but I didn\u2019t care.
