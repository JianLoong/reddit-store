{"id": 28162, "submission_id": "16z2chl", "title": "AITA For going to college at my cousin's dream school even though he didn't get in?", "selftext": "Throw away account. The title is pretty clear. I don't think I'm in the wrong, but I could use a second opinion because I'm getting really annoyed with the drama. \n\nBasic context, I (18f) just got into a really good college. I'm there right now, sitting on my dorm room bed typing this. I have a cousin (18m) that also wanted to attend this particular school. He'd been talking about it since we were in middle school. He was absolutely positive he would get in, but didn't. \n\nSupposedly, my cousin had a full on freak out when he got rejected, but I wasn't there for that. He got his email a few days before I got mine. My parents were overjoyed that I'd gotten in, and with a big scholarship, but as soon as my uncle, aunt, and cousin heard, they jumped on me immediately. Calls, texts, showing up to my parents house uninvited, trying to convince me to give my spot to my cousin. He was livid that I was accepted but he wasn't. I told him it was probably because I had a bunch of extracurriculars and he didn't because he thought they were a \"waste of valuable study time\". He said I didn't work as hard as him or get as good of grades as him and didn't deserve to go to this college but he couldn't. I told him tough shit, that's life, and he screamed that I'd probably just drop out anyways because I won't be able to handle it like he would. It got to the point that I just left my phone off and exclusively used my laptop for about a week because they wouldn't stop bugging me. Once they figured out they wouldn't get me to give my cousin my acceptance (because I literally can't, that's not how acceptance works) they started trying to convince me to go to a different school. Since apparently this one \"can't actually be all that good if they couldn't even recognize a talented and smart person like my cousin\". And that I'd probably be much happier at some other school. \n\nThis went on until the day I left for school three weeks ago. The day I left my cousin actually came to my parents house just before I left and told me flat out that if I really went through with this we weren't family anymore because he \"doesn't want to be related to someone that would be so willing to steal his dreams\" (actual quote). I told him okay and got in my car. Now I'm all set up in my dorm, my roommate is fun as heck, classes are going well, and I'm really happy. My cousin still keeps posting angsty junk on his Instagram about dreams being false and hard work being BS that doesn't get you anywhere. It's annoying. \n\nSo what do you guys think? Should I have gone to a different school? AITA?", "created_utc": 1696364511, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16z2chl/aita_for_going_to_college_at_my_cousins_dream/", "score": 943, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They\u2019re losing touch w reality. \nNTA.", "NTA\n\nHow could you possibly be an asshole for going to a school your cousin didn't get into?

Your cousin went over the top here - I get that it must have sucked for him to lose the chance to attend his dream school like that, but you didn't \"steal\" his spot and if you didn't go they would have given your spot to a stranger, not to him.  \n\nIt's fine for you to try to be sensitive and not rub it in your cousin's face that you got to go to his dream school, but that's not what you're doing.  He needs to pull his head out of his ass and make the most of wherever he DID get in.\n\nPS: It's \"waste\" of time, no wonder he didn't get in ;)", "NTA. And he\u2019s right, you aren\u2019t family. Not because you \u201cstole\u201d his dreams but because he and his family can\u2019t just be happy for you. You didn\u2019t take anything from him. You earned it and he didn\u2019t.", "OMG, Just block him on everything. NTA.\n\nHis parents deluded him to think that grades were everything. They sold him the idea that as long as worked hard at school, he'd get into his preferred college. While that can be true for some colleges, others like to see that you were able to do things outside of school, like volunteer, extracurriculars, etc. He can't be mad at you that he didn't get in (well he can, be it's misdirected).\n\nI'm not sure why your parents didn't put an end to this behavior immediately.", "NTA.

Graduate top of your class and rub it in his jealous AH face.", "NTA - how would you be able to give up your spot for your cousin? Unless you have some pull at the university, I don't think you giving up your seat is going to ensure your cousin gets in. His email didn't say he was on a waitlist either, he was rejected. Your cousin is being an AH but I can kinda make space for how your cousin in reacting, he's still youngish and college is a major milestone. Your uncle and aunt though, looks like immaturity has no age limits. They need to be helping your cousin deal with his emotions better instead of hounding you. Good thing you said goodbye to his idiotic ass and went where you wanted to be. Congratulations.", "NTA - what a whiny baby he is!  Shoot for the moon, you might land among the stars.

NTA\n\nCousin needs to grow up. He didn\u2019t get into the school he wanted. Not the first person nor will he be the last person this happens to.

I just mentioned that their strengths might be in doubt. \"You might not be as great as you think you are?\" Many things are weighed in the admissions process. But, sometimes people have to accept that others are actually worthier.\n\nEven if you rejected their admission - there was certainly no way they'd backhand it to your cousin, after all. Instead judging you and praying for failure they should reevaluate what he needs to be successful.\n\nsigh. This is so ridiculous to me. \"When I am disappointed in myself, I blame me. You should try it. Then you can change into a better person and a useful adult.\"\n\nNTA. No matter what you said, this all was really unnecessary for them to harass you with. \"You might be a rock star pal. But, first, you have to get in.\" CONGRATULATIONS, btw.", "NTA.  Why would you crash your future for something that has nothing to do with you?  If you declined to go to your school, the likelihood that the next person in line was your cousin is 0%.  He would have been notified he was wait-listed.  Maybe block your cousin on IG.", "NTA.  You need to stop looking at your cousin's Instagram account. He's bitter and delusional, as is anyone who thinks he could and should have just slid into your spot -even if you wanted to - and that you should give up your school just because he can't go. \n\nThe immature tantrum is even more proof the school made a wise choice not to accept him. He didn't even apply to another school, did he? Good luck in mommy's basement, howling at the moon.", "\"and told me flat out that if I really went through with this we weren't family anymore\"\n\nThe only proper response is \"Okay.

NTA enjoy college and please please graduate with the highest honours you can to really rub it in!", "NTA!!! What a delulu bunch! Definitely cut contact! It's absolutely insane to think that college places are transferable! He can't be that smart if he thinks that! He's the cause of his own problems! \n\nYou enjoy college and soak up all that new knowledge and have a good time, don't waste your time or energy thinking about them!", "NTA\n\nI mean, I want to call this fake, because I can't believe anyone  (cousin/aunt/uncle) are this stupid to act this way.  \n\nLike you said... if you turned it down, he wouldn't suddenly get in. Most schools have waitlists.  He got rejected;  not wait listed.", "NTA. Sounds like his dream school saw he was too immature to be a student there. Good luck and enjoy the experience. I'm a long-time ticket holder on the old petty train. Come on board by making sure he and his equally childish parents hear about every good grade and every great experience you have. It's called salt in an open wound. LOL", "WTF, they actually thought you could give you spot to him!! What were his grades and test scores like, was it good enough to get in or did he fall short there as well?   Did he get into any other college or is he just sitting at home crying like a spoiled little boy.  Flood your social media with how well you are doing and how great it is there.  Let your classmates know about his page.  They can have some fun with it (just don't do it yourself).", "WOW!!\nAbsolutely, positively NTA.\nBest of luck to you. Have a blast and graduate with that degree. \nYour cousin and his parents are ridiculous.

Don't listen to them.  NTA", "NTA. You got in, you have a right to go.\n\nThough I agree that it's dumb that someone can be rejected by a university because they don't play the bagpipes or something, like you need to do that to study any non-music related subject.", "Absolutely NTA you are allowed to go and do whatever you want to do. It\u2019s incredibly selfish what your cousin and family is doing. The best advice is to study hard and do well. They\u2019ll get over it and if they don\u2019t, fuck em. \n\nSimilarly, my bff growing up and I lost our friendship over choosing schools. We had always said we\u2019d go to the same state school and I had the opportunity to go to a way nicer college out of state so I took it. She took it personally and stopped being my friend. It sucked but I know I didn\u2019t do anything wrong or hurtful.", "NTA - Your cousin is utterly delusional.", "NTA. \n\nWhy would you? You earned a place in a good school, with a \"big scholarship\", as you said. He did not. Did you ask him why not? Why was he not good enough to earn his place with that scholarship? This is on him.\n\nI hope you'll thrive. I hope you can do the work to be the best version of yourself, while enjoying being at that prestigious school. Remember: The best revenge is a good life. You'll go there, I'm sure. You got it.\n\nHe can go pound sand. I mean, having his parents to go over to your place to try to prevent you to go to the school you wanted to go to... that's shabby.", "By any chance, is your aunt, uncle, and cousin\u2019s surname Dursley? Because all three sound infantile,  deluded and stupid.", "He probably did not get in because his attitude sucks and his parents did not help for sure.", "NTA\n\nFirst congrats! I hope your first semester us off to a good start!\n\nSecond, I have a feeling if you were a boy none of this would be an issue. It's giving very \" some woman stole my spot\" 1950s vibes. Or \" that person of color took my job\", although POC wouldn't be the word of choice if you catch my drift. \n\nI bet nothing is his fault, every success is deserved, and anything he wants should be his. I hope he cries about it and grows the heck up. No one needs family like that.", "In no way, shape, or form should you be required to mess up your life because someone else didn't get to do something. No chance.

No idea why you should put your life and prospects on hold because he didn't. Sorry about your cousin's luck, he should have worked harder.

LOL. The college will just admit the next on the list. \n\nThey just want to punish you becuase he couldn't hack it, and that is total BS. What in the patriarchy is going on here? Reading between the lines, I'd say they don't want him to feel insecure by always being compared to your (much-higher) accomplishments - so they are trying to bully you into taking a lesser pathway than him, in order to guarantee his relative success. Go show them there is no comparison. \n\nThey are unnecessarily competitive and bitter, poor them. They should feel genuinely happy for your accomplishment, but if they can't put their own disappointment aside, well that is their own burden to bear.

The title is pretty clear. I don't think I'm in the wrong, but I could use a second opinion because I'm getting really annoyed with the drama. \n\nBasic context, I (18f) just got into a really good college. I'm there right now, sitting on my dorm room bed typing this. I have a cousin (18m) that also wanted to attend this particular school. He'd been talking about it since we were in middle school. He was absolutely positive he would get in, but didn't. \n\nSupposedly, my cousin had a full on freak out when he got rejected, but I wasn't there for that. He got his email a few days before I got mine. My parents were overjoyed that I'd gotten in, and with a big scholarship, but as soon as my uncle, aunt, and cousin heard, they jumped on me immediately. Calls, texts, showing up to my parents house uninvited, trying to convince me to give my spot to my cousin. He was livid that I was accepted but he wasn't. I told him it was probably because I had a bunch of extra curriculars and he didn't because he thought they were a \"waist of valuable study time\". He said I didn't work as hard as him or get as good of grades as him and didn't deserve to go to this college but he couldn't. I told him tough shit, that's life, and he screamed that I'd probably just drop out anyways because I won't be able to handle it like he would. It got to the point that I just left my phone off and exclusively used my laptop for about a week because they wouldn't stop bugging me. Once they figured out they wouldn't get me to give my cousin my acceptance (because I literally can't, that's not how acceptance works) they started trying to convince me to go to a different school. Since apparently this one \"can't actually be all that good if they couldn't even recognize a talented and smart person like my cousin\". And that I'd probably be much happier at some other school. \n\nThis went on until the day I left for school three weeks ago. The day I left my cousin actually came to my parents house just before I left and told me flat out that if I really went through with this we weren't family anymore because he \"doesn't want to be related to someone that would be so willing to steal his dreams\" (actual quote). I told him okay and got in my car. Now I'm all set up in my dorm, my roommate is fun as heck, classes are going well, and I'm really happy. My cousin still keeps posting angsty junk on his Instagram about dreams being false and hard work being BS that doesn't get you anywhere. It's annoying. \n\nSo what do you guys think? Should I have gone to a different school? AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also felt that all that mattered was intelligence, so he never did sports, never got into scouting, never joined any clubs, never tried to do anything in church or in town.  Life was just school, books, and games.  And his grades weren't even THAT good, considering how smart he was.  His ACT and SAT scores, well, they were phenomenal...and he still got rejected from everything better than the lower-tier of the two major state universities.  And for nearly thirty years, he blamed it on the colleges, not him doing fuck-all in high school.

I mean, did you apply for the same program as him? Do you have the exact same backgrounds and focuses? A lot of schools dole out spots to different departments, less popular departments might have more available slots for incoming students, and there\u2019s always going to be a certain number of general student slots as well.

My sister\u2019s eldest did not and the only uni she wanted to go to was the mentioned.  Cue a flood load of advice from concerned grandparents and my sister, trying to tell me how unsuited this uk would be for our son.  The kicker\u2026..

Meanwhile when our eldest child went through the same process, no one from the family cared where he could attend.\n\nI just reamed them out telling them to mind their own business.

As a matter of fact stay away for awhile. Let them keep living in their delusions.", "He\u2019s TAH. Girl live your life, brush it off and thrive. He is the reason he didn\u2019t get it. It has nothing to do with you. He\u2019s being selfish and childish.", "NTA\n\nI suspect your cousin wasn't accepted into his dream school because of his attitude that has been enabled by his parents.", "NTA\n\n1. While I feel bad for your cousin, you did not steal his dream. For one, he could re-apply or transfer later one.\n2. Your cousin probably worked hard on his grades, but failed to do his research on the admission process or got really bad intel from a really crappy guidance counsellor. If it is not a lack of exctracurriculuras, it could be something about his essay or something in the interviewing process. \n3. The reason, dreams are called dreams, is that they are not priviledges. You dream of something, you have to work for it. And again, he did with regards to grades, but sadly for him, that seems to be the extent of it. And the fact that his parents thought you could transfer your acceptance, kind of shows that THEY also did not do enough research. \n4. He is hurt, and that is understandable, but while his grades may be better, you did other work. You did something that made that school say yes. Simple as that. Congrats.\n5. From the sound of it, you each had similiar opportunity, you did not steal anything ,you just earned something that he was equally eligible to earn.\n6. You not going to that school would not have made him feel better either, as he will always know that you got in in the first place.", "NTA. Given his inability to handle rejection & disappointment, the school made the right call. Better that he has this meltdown now\u2014at home\u2014where his parents can get him help, rather than in his dorm with a not-invested-in-his-tantrums roommate after he fails a midterm or two. He needs therapy and some real-life experience.", "NTA...   i would send him lots of photos of your happy life at the school with all your new friends.. and tell him that seeing as you are not family anymore then the images you send shouldn't matter to him..", "NTA\n\nHe didn't work hard enough to get in.", "The belief that an acceptance can be gifted shows that the college correct did not admit the cousin; he's delusional.", "For real and who only applies to one school with no realistic back up? When I applied I sent out like 6 different apps and 5 out of 6 approved which then I realized they mostly want the monies lmao", "If this were how admissions worked, people would sell their spots all the time. \n\nI got into a pretty good school, and I almost wish I could've sold my spot to some underacheiving rich kid.", "Well, if he were smart enough to know that, perhaps he would have gotten in. His lack of logical reasoning makes him unprepared for the real world", "This is tell all. Their entire family unit quite literally does not understand post secondary admissions... maybe that's why he didn't get through admissions? NTA", "Right? That's not even how any of this works!

I got into a college many students from my high school got rejected from. They were confident that there was a maximum number of students they would accept from any given high school (private university if that matters). So they assumed I \u201cstole\u201d their spot and really took it out on me spreading rumors of me doing absurd things to bribe myself in. In hindsight, I wish I kept my acceptance to myself, it was that bad.", "Yup some schools place more importance on well rounded students", ">You might not be as great as you think you are?\"\n\nI would have loved to see the cousin and his parents reaction if OP said this. I imagine it'd be a full sweeping stuff off the table and then flipping it scene.", "This behavior reminds me of when i worked at my college's alumni donor call center. I had more than a few angry alum say racist stuff because their 'super smart, amazing kid who got a (insert average ACT/SAT score) on their tests didn't get in, cause the school only wants \\[insert racist bs\\]'. People think they are entitled to things, and when they can't get it, they want everyone to suffer for it.", "It\u2019s a battle royal type thing for sure \ud83d\ude06", "He\u2019s a Man, OP is a mediocre female. Clearly he deserves it more than her! Once the chancellor hears about this silly mistake, surely he\u2019ll be enrolled and OP will be removed immediately\u2026. him, probably\u2026. /s", "I also work at a university (UK though) - the offer was made to an individual, not her and her wider family. It's just nuts that they'd think she could reassign her offer to someone who wasn't even given a conditional offer. \n\nIt might depend on the subject they'd applied for; at least where I am, all courses have requirements to make sure the student will be able to grasp the material, but some courses are so oversubscribed that they're simply more competitive.  \n\nIt sounds like they were looking for a well rounded candidate here, rather than someone who thought it was a waste of time not to study.  I think cousin was let down by whoever advised him to do that, or just ignored advice to develop other interests.  Or maybe he bombed the interview process. I can understand that it's incredibly disappointing, but now would be a good time to reflect and develop; he could apply next year.

She was complaining about a friend getting into a school that rejected her and refused to be realistic. It was a long time ago. But, people need to get a grip sometimes. She's really bright. But, that doesn't mean no one else is more qualified.", "My bets are on OP. Everyone else being loud and acting s fool, OP just quietly saunter on by and grab the enemy's flag, nobody the wiser until it's over", "And this is why you steer your kid away from having a \u2018dream school\u2019 before they understand the incredible odds on getting into any particular school.  I know a lot of really smart kids who want to go to MIT.  It\u2019s a tiny fraction of the population that gets admitted and there are DOZENS of other amazing schools where you can study those same subjects.", "Fine. Have a dream school. But Prepare!  \nResearch how to assure your acceptance. Extracurricular activities like OP. Volunteer. Whatever. Focusing exclusively on grades and GPA is short-sighted and probably sure to fail, as we see here. Thems the breaks. Too bad. So sad.  \nTake a gap year to volunteer and reapply. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd", "Do people seriously dream about university whilst in primary school? I could barely think forward enough to the next day when I was that age.
