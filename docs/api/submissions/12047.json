That is disgusting. Why is she using your closed for her dirty laundry? Can't she use her own?", "NTA. You have told her repeatedly that her putting her dirty clothes in your closet bothers you. She needs to be at LEAST putting dirty clothes in a basket and anywhere but your closet. She\u2019s 28, not 10.", "NTA. What is wrong with her? You expressed it bothered you multiple times and she refused to use a hamper like a grown up. If you have separate closets, she has no reason to be in yours let alone creating a mess in there.", ">so there\u2019s a pileup of clothes sitting in my closet.

Wtf.  That\u2019s just plain gross as well as disrespectful to your space.  Nobody wants their clean clothes to smell like someone else\u2019s weeks old dirty laundry, and nobody really wants dirty laundry laying around their bedroom or closet for weeks on end either.  You\u2019re definitely NTA.\n\nEdit: Adding to say that there\u2019s tons of ways for her to be working around this and her \u201cset up\u201d such as just throwing them in a dirty laundry hamper, the washing machine, or in her own closet.  It\u2019s like she\u2019s marking her territory in your closet.  I hope you figure it out.", "Nta.  My husband is not the neatest but his pile stays in front of his dresser. Id just move her pile or start throwing it away.

She refused to clean up after herself, and she would never do laundry. The only reason why your wife is doing laundry every three weeks, is because she\u2019s run out of clothes to wear. Eventually, she\u2019s going to start rummaging through your stuff.

You have told her multiple times that this isn't acceptable to you, and she ignores you. I can understand getting frustrated to the point of yelling.", "NTA and its the exact words she needed to hear. Thought you might be the A before hearing your story and its disgusting to just cram clothes into your closet when she has a space and on top of clean clothes is a definite no no.

Is your wardrobe simply closer to where she changes? So is it laziness?\n\nNTA: I\u2019d be annoyed and frustrated too", "A few months ago? The sudden onset is concerning. Maybe start with her primary care physician.", "NTA. Her undies sit for WEEKS unwashed? She throws them in your closet instead of the hamper? She throws dirty drawers on top of your clean clothes??\n\nSomething is not right here. Is her mental health ok? You really should not have woken her up out of a dead sleep by yelling, but\u2026 y\u2019all need to have a deep discussion about what\u2019s going on. NTA, in light of the ongoing issue.", "NTA. She\u2019s an AH just for putting her dirty clothes in your closet instead of hers. Everything else just makes it worse.", "NTA - but what in all hell is going on with your wife?\n\nI hate doing laundry myself (I am wife), but I'm not gonna dump my dirty shit on top of my husband's stuff. That's just fuckin' rude.\n\nSome basic respect for your area and items and time needs to happen, even if she only wants to do her laundry every two to three weeks, then she can keep it out of your space.\n\nEdit: Talking about it with my own husband, we agree that there is an underlying odd reason for her to put *her* dirty clothes in *your* closet. That might be where you need to start. With why it is so important. \n\nIt might not even be about the laundry, and there's something that needs translated from weird brain language?", "Nta I\u2019d be very grossed out by dirty clothes on my clean ones. No idea what your wife\u2019s deal is but it\u2019s not cool.", "NTA if my husband was doing this after asking him not to many times I honestly would start treating him like a child that doesn't take care of their belongings away they go, whether that's trash, donation or just putting them somewhere else til he started changing. \n\nHer reasoning being aesthetic is a horrible excuse to not take care of her clothes and put them in a laundry basket because nasty clothes laying around is not aesthetic it's gross.", "There's something wrong with your wife. What she is doing isn't normal, and there's clearly something going on with her. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  WTH is wrong with her?  You both need couples therapy, something isn't right.", "NTA. She has her own closet? Throw your dirty clothes into her clean stuff and see how she reacts.", "There\u2019s something else going on here. Who deliberately puts their dirty laundry back into their partner\u2019s closet after it\u2019s moved???", "NTA 100%\n\nBut did you really did to air your dirty laundry on Reddit?\n\n\n\n\n\nJk... I wanted to make the pun... I saw no one take the opportunity!!! So I took it!!", "NTA, and I say this as someone who would usually say that anyone shouting and swearing at their partner also sucks. I just can\u2019t wrap my head around why she would think that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s so gross and disrespectful.", "NTA but your wife absolutely is. This isn\u2019t some executive dysfunction issue where she leaves messes and struggles to follow through on cleaning- she has a system. Her system is to throw her dirty clothes in YOUR space. She has escalated to throwing dirty underwear on your clean clothes. Does she like you?", "NTA.\n\nInstall a lock on your closet. Do your own laundry.   \nAnd how the heck did your wife get such a filthy habit? Her behavior doesn\u2019t appear normal - is she seeing a psychologist or counselor or a doctor?", "I would keep asking her why she is doing that until she comes back with a solid answer because that's disgusting.", "You\u2019re NTA you\u2019re human expressing your emotions even good people get angry and fed up, maybe now she knows it\u2019s a big deal to you, I hope you calm down go home and go over the issue in a calm manner, I am sure she is scared of how you reacted, I hope you guys sort it out.", "NTA, just install a damn lock on your closet and watch her try to argue about it like a child. She created this situation herself by not respecting you and your space.\n\nOr if you wanna be petty start putting your dirty laundry in her closet and see what she does about it.", "What the hell kind of system is that.  A hamper is the system.  NTA", "I don\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t just use her closet???? That makes zero sense. This is so rude! NTA, OP. I would be livid if my husband did this. You\u2019ve addressed it many times to no avail and now she has taken to putting her dirty clothes on your clean clothes which is just not acceptable.", "I have a degree in sociology, and in a family and society class in college, I read housework was the number 1 cited disagreement divorcing/divorced couples cited. It sounded absurd to me as a 20 something college student.  But now in my 40s and married, having friends that are married or divorced...I get it.", "NTA. Based on your comment she said she is intentionally putting her dirty clothes in your closet because she doesn\u2019t like the aesthetics of dirty clothes where she can see them. So she forces them on you despite you saying you don\u2019t like it. \n\nShe knows she\u2019s doing laundry infrequently. She knows it\u2019s irritating to see/look at. She\u2019s intentionally hiding it in your closet so she doesn\u2019t have to look at it.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t want to look at it, then she should wash it, not hide it with you like you\u2019re the local dumping ground.", "NTA. You tried every resolution and she refuses- that makes NO sense. It sounds like when a cat pisses on your stuff. Dirty. Spiteful. Gross.", "Get her a hamper with a damn lid on it and put it in her closet. Bedazzle it and lock your closet door", "NTA. Your wife is being disrespectful. You've already asked her to use a hamper and she has refused. I would start throwing away any of her dirty clothes that end up in your closet.", "NTA. It sounds like you hit your breaking point. I'd be furious if my husband's dirty clothes were on top of my clean clothes.\n\nAlso, waiting 2 to 3 weeks to do your laundry seems pretty excessive. I don't understand how people can be okay with dirty clothes scattered everywhere. \n\nHave you tried to ask her why she does this? If she washes certain things separately, does she need more baskets?\n\nAlso, you keep saying she keeps putting her dirty laundry in your closet. Does she have her own closet?\n\nEdit: I read a comment OP made that said his wife's closest is bigger than his. \n\nYeah, OP, at this point, just start locking your closet door. If you don't have a lock for it, get one. Your wife is just disrespecting your personal space.", "I mean, there was a nicer way of saying it, but NTA. That's really gross. How hard is it to just put a hamper in the closet and toss the clothes in there. And the fact that she took them out of the hamper to put them on the floor is beyond an f u to you. It's like she's marking that territory as hers or something. In a calm moment, ask her why she's doing it and tell her she needs to get a basket or something.", "NTA. That is disgusting. Wtf is the matter with her? She is a grown woman. Sounds like all other means of trying to get her to change were exhausted, it's no wonder you snapped. Why on earth does she even put it there when she has her own closet and lau dry basket????? Bizarre behaviour", "NTA\u2026 your wife needs a therapist ASAP", "NTA,but why are you doing individual loads of laundry? I have a house washing machine. There are three of us in the house. All dirty laundry goes in one basket, loads get sorted,washer, dried, ironed and then sorted into the appropriate wardrobes", "NTA. She\u2019s unhinged.

I\u2019d have a pileup of dirty laundry in my otherwise tidy closet, and it sucked, but it was my mess to take ownership of. Instead, she\u2019s pawning her mess off on you.

She needs to grow up & stop being lazy.", "I\u2019d lock my closet", "NTA, what the hell", "NTA but what the fuck? Everyone has their limits.", "NTA  Tell her you will start throwing stuff out if it is in your closet.

Do you have a place to hide them?", "NTA - she is weirdly entitled to using your closet space. I\u2019d lose it too. I personally would start putting it all in garbage bags anytime it\u2019s there.", "NTA. That's disgusting!!! I'd have locked my closet or something the second time she did that. I'm also a petty person so I'd just dump all her dirty clothes out in the trash too if she kept doing that.\n\nWith that said, if this behaviour just started a few months ago I'd really considered getting her to a therapist. There might be other issues underlying the change.", "NTA and for the record I really can't stand this trait in people. Then they lose it and act like a baby when called out on shit behavior.", "NTA. Your wife sounds like a nightmare", "NTA\u2026.why she keeping her dirty laundry on the floor in your closet?  It\u2019s beyond me why she thinks this is normal behavior and why she would move her dirty clothing from the laundry basket to your closet floor.  Have you asked her why she\u2019s doing this?", "NTA \n\nAt this point, she's doing it intentionally. Why? F if I know, doesn't even make sense.

So make it inconvenient, even if that means a lock or a chain/bar guard, or placing a hamper directly in front of your closet, such that she\u2019d have to move it to get inside.

It's a straight up power play of saying I am going to do this, I know it upsets you, deal with it. I don't even buy her excuse of her doing it because she doesn't want to mess up her aesthetic, again if that were true she wouldn't dump them back out in his closet after he picked them up.", "Hopefully the wife Bounce-s back and Gain-s enough sense to do her laundry.", "I would guess that OP's wife has some sort of major problem with laundry \u2014 not just doing it, but seeing it and touching it. She carries the clothes to OP's closet to hide them. Not from OP, but from herself. If it was in her closet, she would have to see it while getting dressed; if it was in a proper basket, she would look at that basket and think, *ah, the basket with the laundry in. The laundry that I have to do.* So instead she puts it somewhere out of sight until she can't ignore it any more. I have no idea *why* she has this aversion, but I think that's why she does this.", "I feel the need to understand her process, maybe if OOP asked her to walk him through her \"laundry process\" that may she's some light? What light that is, I have no idea, I'm highly neurotic about many things and particular about laundry as well but this just makes zero sense. He's NTA for sure, she's gross", ">Or she's really just that lazy and doesn't care. Either way,\n\nIt can't be lazy since she deliberately took her dirty clothes *out of the hamper* to throw them back into OP's closet. \n\nIt's so bizarre it really looks like some mental health issue.", "Oh for fuck sake lmao", "I just saw his comment. Thanks!", "She doesn't want her dirty clothes on there with hers.  Gross!  \n\nNTA OP.", "Oh I read some of his comments. Thats basically what her reasoning is. She doesn't want to mess with the aesthetics of her closet. Somehow I think that makes it even worse. Like \"I don't want to look at the mess I made in my own space, so I'm going to be selfish and make you look at it in your space instead.\"  Like how disrespectful. I'd have lost it with her much sooner if I was him. A decorative laundry basket with a lid is a perfectly reasonable solution she just won't do it.", "Is there a linen or hallway closet? To put a basket with her clothes? Are you willing to bag up and hide what she puts in your closet so when she goes to do laundry she can't because the clothes are \"gone\"?", "All you need is a hasp and a small but sturdy padlock. Since talking and asking isn't working and she seems hellbent on trampling over your space when she has plenty of her own, I'd try this. And if she breaks the lock, then you have to consider whether you can live with someone who cares so little about your boundaries.\n\nWhatever you do next, good luck man. Unequivocally NTA.", "No, there are locks for those kinds of doors. No need to reinstall anything. Just look for the same kind of lock you would put on French doors.", "Going slightly off topic now but with me, it is an ADHD thing to see messages and not respond immediately so end up never responding, to not think to message people to check up (again its very out of sight and out of mind) but I work very hard against it so I'm not being an AH to people. Not do it on purpose!", "For $80 you can get a fingerprint lock door knob. And [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Foxgard-Fingerprint-Keyless-Biometric-Storage/dp/B0BNT6CR8C/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?adgrpid=87439895412&gclid=Cj0KCQiA6rCgBhDVARIsAK1kGPKlKuhFupMUJ_wkIjOSSLTPu6GRjKXf4CDm5gqOpKZIxY8U9-ClCHYaAoY-EALw_wcB&hvadid=394754717645&hvdev=m&hvlocphy=9010691&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=5298320582366392906&hvtargid=kwd-853772581191&hydadcr=14624_9750607&keywords=fingerprint%2Bdoor%2Bknob%2Block&qid=1678581003&sr=8-4&th=1&psc=1) has a $20 coupon right now and also works with an app.", "It\u2019s a very real possibility if she wasn\u2019t always like this. If it were adhd or depression it wouldn\u2019t be intentionally carrying it to his closet it would be just struggle piles all over where she disrobes.", "He says she's not in the post, but with one word answers, so not sure if they've actually explored that possibility or not.\n\nMH issues aside, I wonder if she's not just being passive-aggressive about something else. Like is she mad about something he does and this is her \"revenge\" of sorts? I don't think there's enough INFO here.", "idk, this kind of seems more like she's fucking with him on purpose. I'm the first to advocate for being gentle with people who struggle like this, but as someone who has both depression and ADHD, there is no way on god's green earth that i would go out of my way to create more work for myself by taking my dirty laundry *out* of the hamper after someone else had already put them *in* for me. it's fascinating to me that she has the energy and wherewithal for that, but *not* for putting the dirty laundry where it *actually* belongs. something is wrong here in a way that makes me feel worried for OP.", "Man, ya gotta add that /s at the end or idiots like me reply with a total Whoosh moment!\n\nBut yea, rereading it I can totally see the sarcasm meow. This one\u2019s on me.", "She probably feels like shit staring at her own laundry so needs it out of sight and OPs wardrobe is one of the few places she can stash things and never have to come across them.\n\nThat way the selfish asshole can delude herself she is clean and organised.", "but then why not move the basket itself into OP's closet? He stated that she'll toss her clothes on the floor of his closet, even if he'd put them in the basket. She could just move the whole basket in that case.\n\nShe could also just ask OP to take over the chore. Like, if she loathes it so much, just ask him to do both their laundry and she will do the dishes or sweep or something as the trade off", "If it's not some kind of bizarrely fucked up power play, it's definitely a mental health issue. Whether that's depression or something else is up to her to figure out in therapy. I do think it explains all the details - like, she's not putting her clothes in HER closet, because she'd see them there, a hamper is a reminder of her dirty clothes, so the option is then her husband's closet where she can ignore it entirely (... I guess...). But it's absolutely an unacceptable way to do things and if she doesn't get help for it then she's about to torpedo their marriage.", "I don't understand why she doesn't just take it to the laundry room.", "I mean... she could have her hamper in the laundry room/area if it messes up her \"aesthetic.\" Just a suggestion to OP. \n\nIf that doesn't work for their house, tough tiddies to her, she shouldn't be putting her dirty laundry in OP's closet.", "Basket with a lid if she wanted to hide the laundry. She's being ridiculous", "I agree that it doesn\u2019t make sense. Also, if this is this deeply irrational, you would think it would play out in other ways as well, not just with the dirty laundry.", "but she apparently moved it back to his closet after he picked it up into her basket for her", "I have ADHD and depression, both of which I\u2019m working on managing, and have habits similar to his wife in regards to putting off laundry. One way I manage is with a schedule, which I can\u2019t stray from for anything otherwise it never gets done & causes some issues when I do. I also have a couple alarms on my phone for weekly use that always stay on so I can have a visible reminder to switch over laundry. But even with these issues I\u2019ve never intentionally taken my dirty laundry and put it on other people\u2019s things. Much less picked it back up after someone moved it to put it back on their items. There\u2019s definitely something going on, but I highly doubt it\u2019s either of those things.", "My first thought was OCD. I have it along with weird storing habbits for my stuff, though I never invade others' space. Quite the opposite.", "It\u2019s all good. :)", "Saying she's just selfish and entitled makes sense and it's the most logical answer there's just something about it that makes me think its deeper, almost bordering someone testing their limits before they start abusing someone. It may just be that it's so weird I'm over thinking it but it seems like it's something deeper being disgused as a simple issue.", "But where is the basket? Is it in his closet, where she would then enter, empty the basket on to his floor or is it in her closet?\n\nThe above hypothesis works if it's in her closet or their bedroom. It doesn't work if it's in his closet.", "I deal with the same issues you do but I don\u2019t keep my dirty clothes in my husbands closet. You mentioned a couple of tips?  Do you have any other resources that you find helpful? These things are kicking my ass now and any help for how you manage your daily routines would be a HUGE help\u2026", "Same, I have adhd and depression as well, and I can relate to what you\u2019re going through and I would never intentionally put my dirty clothes mixed in with someone\u2019s clean clothes in their own closet. Or move it back after that someone moved their clean clothes away from my dirty ones. It\u2019s definitely something else.", "As someone above said it would be dumped where she took it off if it were that (I have both too, lol and also tend to just dump my clothes) not in his closet, esp since they seem to have separate ones? Delaying her personal laundry wouldn\u2019t affect OP much and imo isn\u2019t fair to get mad at on it\u2019s own, but she\u2019s actively going out of her way to dump it with his stuff it seems? Which is just being rude, whatever the underlying cause might be.", "It's the stomping all over u/throwawaylaundrywife's space, property, and his feelings.  Not only is she just being gross and irresponsible with her laundry, she is invading his space (his separate closet), treating his property like crap (getting her filth all over his clean clothes), and showing that she doesn't give a crap about his feelings (he's already told her to stop and that it bothers him).  That's why it feels like the crap that abusers pull.  EDIT: Oh yeah, throw in the manipulative DARVO type behavior when she cried about him standing up for himself.  Yep, that's why it feels like that.", "Why would her laundry basket be in his closet in the first place", "Personally I have a physical calendar. I do laundry every Monday, sweeping & mopping on Tuesdays etc. So when a new month starts I always go through and write everything down on the corresponding day it\u2019s supposed to be done. For laundry specifically, I have multiple alarms that are set for repeat. Washing machine takes 30 minutes, the dryer takes 1 hour 10 minutes. So when I put laundry in, I turn on the alarms because without them I will forget to switch it over or fold the clothes. Having a physical reminder to do these things & alarms helps me remember them. I once forgot to turn on my alarms for the laundry and I ended up forgetting it for an entire week & had to rewash everything, which was super frustrating. My old therapist recommended using a whiteboard to write out a to-do list. It didn\u2019t work well for me, so I experimented until I found what worked. I recommend trying different methods to find out which works the best for you personally.", "Yeah, I also have my struggle pile, but I have to keep a super specific routine, so I always take my clothes off in the same place every time. I agree that if it were a situation where she put her clothes in her closet or on her side of the bed, it would be a bit silly to be mad at her for not doing them in a timely manner, but intentionally putting them in his closet even when he moves them is definitely something else entirely."]}
