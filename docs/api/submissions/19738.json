You \"calling in a favour\" will only teach your kid that they can go above the law.   \nI would consider asking your friend to do a \"play\" with you, where you'll meet the secretary friend WITH your daughter, and then you \"ask\" if there is anything that can be done. Your friend will again explain the rules and the outcome will be that your daughter will not get the gift card.   \nAt home or on the way home, explain to her that you understand her disappointment, give her a big hug and be super empathetic. When she is calmer, explain that sadly this is part of growing up where if we don't make submissions on time, we miss out on opportunities.   \nThis could be a better way to teach her the same lesson, where she won't this that you're just being mean.   \nAnd I would ignore other comments saying that you're being to harsh. These days we're treating our children too much like orchids, protecting them from every possible pain or misadventure. Don't be a helicopter parent, but be kind and caring when your child fails. This will help her grow into a more resilient young adult. \n\nAdditionally, you can say: hey, you didn't get the voucher, but you did really really good, and I would like to acknowledge it.

Now, this wasn't because that's what was expected of me, but after years of parenting like yours, I learned to only value myself based on the work I could do. If I couldn't be the best at school, what was I worth as a person? If I made a mistake, that mistake was forever unchanging. A scar on my personhood.

I learned that everyday is about doing your best and my mental health has improved greatly. However, I no longer have a relationship with my mother.

But, there are ways to prepare your child without sacrificing your relationship. \n\nIt is not wrong for them to do their paperwork, taxes, chores, and get good grades. These are expectations that follow them throughout life. However, you need to show them you are always in their corner as a parent. If you treat them as a full adult now they will learn to be one and never turn to you for help even in circumstances when it's truly needed.
