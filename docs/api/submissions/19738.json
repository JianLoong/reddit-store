Your friend will again explain the rules and the outcome will be that your daughter will not get the gift card.   \nAt home or on the way home, explain to her that you understand her disappointment, give her a big hug and be super empathetic. When she is calmer, explain that sadly this is part of growing up where if we don't make submissions on time, we miss out on opportunities.   \nThis could be a better way to teach her the same lesson, where she won't this that you're just being mean.   \nAnd I would ignore other comments saying that you're being to harsh.

Or if 14 needed surgery so mom forced her to do all the paperwork with the insurance company to get the procedure. These scenarios would be WAY too much for a 14 year old to do alone, these would be VERY high stakes, and the would be many consequences to messing up.

Not an asshole, this is called responsible parenting with natural consequences. And you've missed the point where mom \"stepping in\" isn't really possible at this point.

I get that you want her to learn this lesson about paperwork being important, and that mistakes have consequences, but lessons in real life aren't learned in a vacuum, there are other lessons here to be taught as well.   \n\n\nWhen my brother and I were young adults, we worked together in the same company, and had a conflict where my father became a mediator for us (we were not working for my father and he was not involved in the company we were working for).  My work directly helped my brother get a promotion and once he became my superior, he started taking advantage of me and being unfair with the commission rates, giving our colleagues better deals than what he was giving me. We were arguing at home and my father stepped in and said, \"willing buyer, willing seller\" and that if either of us didn't like the deal, stop working together and that was that. That was the lesson.   \n\n\nIn and of itself, it makes sense, but like I said, lessons in real life aren't learned in a vacuum. Years later I still think about the opportunities lost that day. The lesson he taught us was lazy, it was the bare minimum he could have taught us as a father, and if you want, in business. \"Willing buyer, willing seller\" is a good business lesson, but so is building relationships in business, and appreciating the people you work with and who've helped built you up your business, and being fair at the very least - because perhaps I shouldn't get special treatment from my brother, but he was actually treating me worse than our colleagues. The lessons I learned that day? I can't trust my brother not to take advantage of me. My father values business lessons over familial relationships and treating each other well. The work I so proudly and fiercely did for my brother's benefit not only went unappreciated but got me penalized.   \n\n\nYou teaching your daughter now that not doing her paperwork has consequences is a lazy lesson. You may think it's a low stakes lesson, but I learned from my \"low stakes willing buyer, willing seller lesson\" that I couldn't trust my family with high stakes and I would never go to them for help. You not helping her now - and it doesn't always have to be you necessarily doing the actual fixing - is teaching her if that small mistakes cannot be fixed, what chance does she have with big ones?   \n\n\nTeach her that mistakes have consequences, sure, but also teach her that mistakes can be fixed. Teach her that building personal relationships are important, that if you treat other people well, they will treat you well too, and sometimes that means helping each other. Teach her that there are people who will have her back when she makes mistakes - most importantly, you. Teach her that she can come to you, that she can trust you, for anything, big or small. Perhaps there will come a time when a bigger mistake will cost her and there isn't anything that can be done, but at least she will have learned now to do everything she can to fix it instead of just giving up without even trying, because if you don't help her now, that's what you're teaching her, that you're not even going to try.", "Lmao.

She has done really well with her schoolwork, she\u2019s clearly not being lazy, and I think it\u2019s important that she can associate her hard work with something positive, instead of being punished over making a small mistake. You can help her while also explain to her why it\u2019s important to do your paperwork. It\u2019s also important to learn that sometimes people make mistakes, and that it\u2019s okay to ask for help. If she misses out on this event with all her friends, when she knows that you could have helped her but chose not to, it\u2019s probably something she\u2019ll remember for a long time. Not only can feeling left out from your peers at that age really effect you negatively, but you\u2019re also kind of showing her that despite all her hard work, she is not doing well enough for you because of a small mistake. Life isn\u2019t black and white, helping her out doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll suddenly believe she\u2019s above the rules.

First year of high school, overwhelming workload (especially at the end of the semester!), high achieving kid....teaching your child that making mistakes is okay and asking for forgiveness is okay are also important lessons.

The people here are all adults and so they understand that its not a super important thing in the long run but she is a CHILD. In her brain this is a really big deal and really big event and in her mind (whether correct or not) it seems she is associating this as \"mom isnt willing to help me so im missing out on a humongous event with my friends that i can never get back.\" It really doesn't even matter if its not true bc its more important how things are perceived by children. \n\nAs well, I am a high school teacher and this gives me insight into several things. 1. While she may he a \"mature\" 9th grader, shes still a 9th grader and is only 14/15! That's not full adulthood and she shouldn't be held to full \"adult\" standards yet and mom/dad/guardians still need to help them with some things. 2. Maybe my school is crazy but we would NEVER tell a student who came to us after missing a silly paperwork deadline that they can't participate in a big ceremony like this. This is bc we understand that way worse consequences could happen if we say no. It is extremely common that if a student has 1 or 2 bad experiences with school, they STOP caring. Like, entirely. We don't want to see that happen. 3. The importance of asking for help is more important imo. Even at work when you mess up something big. You need to be able to ask for help and not helping when it is asked for can lead to them just not asking. Admitting mistakes and asking for forgiveness and grace is a life skill and probably 90% of the time in adulthood, asking for grace works out in your favor.\n\nAnyways, im not going to say a-h or n-t-a bc really its just a parenting decision.", "I don\u2019t know how to edit my post but as the parent of 4, I think YTA.", "Not just an award, with a paper certificate and maybe a ribbon, but also a gift card.

But no one just sends that money to you, unasked-for. You have to tell them you want it by claiming it. If you want it, and feel it's worth it, you claim it. If not, not.

Even taxes, there are forms and paths for dealing with it.  \n\nSeems like you\u2019re missing an opportunity to teach what you do when you screw up. I would have had her dress up in a business-like outfit, practice how to apologize to the secretary herself, explain that she understands if it\u2019s not possible because events are a lot of work, but she\u2019d like to be given a second chance, and also she has made a system in her school-issued planner for preventing such errors in future? Then practice how to humbly accept either outcome. \n\nPolitely advocating for yourself is completely normal. As a \u201cgood student\u201d myself, knowing when and how to humbly ask for another chance was a critical skill especially in college. Putting effort, respect, and humility into a request gets you pretty far, and that\u2019s not pulling favors. \n\nYou\u2019re not in the wrong because you want to teach her real world skills.
