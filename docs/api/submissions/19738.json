Your friend will again explain the rules and the outcome will be that your daughter will not get the gift card.   \nAt home or on the way home, explain to her that you understand her disappointment, give her a big hug and be super empathetic. When she is calmer, explain that sadly this is part of growing up where if we don't make submissions on time, we miss out on opportunities.   \nThis could be a better way to teach her the same lesson, where she won't this that you're just being mean.   \nAnd I would ignore other comments saying that you're being to harsh.
