Your friend will again explain the rules and the outcome will be that your daughter will not get the gift card.   \nAt home or on the way home, explain to her that you understand her disappointment, give her a big hug and be super empathetic. When she is calmer, explain that sadly this is part of growing up where if we don't make submissions on time, we miss out on opportunities.   \nThis could be a better way to teach her the same lesson, where she won't this that you're just being mean.   \nAnd I would ignore other comments saying that you're being to harsh.

There was a senior who worked on lights all four years. We do a play and a musical each year. He neglected to turn in the paperwork for the play on time. There is always enough interest in the tech crews from students, so light crew was filled by those that did turn in paperwork on time. He was extremely disappointed, and pissed at himself, but he understood though. You can bet that he made sure his paperwork was on time for the musical.", "NTA op, I actually commend you for your approach with teaching your children to get their paperwork done in a low stakes way.\n\nI think you going to the school would be counterintuitive to what you're trying to teach; the whole premise of the kids doing their own paperwork is to prep them for adulthood; they didn't do the paperwork, they don't get the award. It's a natural consequence.\n\nI work in HR and everybody ignores all the paperwork I send them. Currently it's health insurance; there's a huge risk of employees missing out on getting insurance because they won't do the paperwork. I wish their mothers had done something similar to this because it's a really great way for them to learn that actions (or in this case, inactions) have consequences and that those consequences can't always just be waived just because you want them to be.", "Yta", "Learning that if you don't get your shit done bad stuff happens, or you miss opportunities is really, really valuable. She may be pissed at you now, but when she's in college and she can manage her own stuff and she's surrounded by clueless classmates, she'll appreciate it.", "NTA\n\nShe'll learn from this.", "NTA. I wish more people had parents like you who helped slowly acclimate them to the adult world with low stakes consequences. This is a valuable low stakes lesson \u201c, but definitely make a point to celebrate your kid\u2019s awesome accomplishment.", "NTA. This is a minor thing in the long run, but is upsetting for your daughter now. Her failure to do boring routine paperwork has meant that she doesn\u2019t get the reward she wanted. It won\u2019t affect her life long term. \n\nBe empathetic and kind, but don\u2019t fix it for her. It\u2019s good for her to learn about screw ups now when you\u2019re there to support her fully and help her back up (and the screw up itself doesn\u2019t really matter). If you\u2019re feeling really sorry for her, maybe get her something small like an ice cream and reassure her that you still see how awesome her other achievements are.", "NTA. She knew she had to do the paperwork and she didn\u2019t. It\u2019s not unreasonable for a 15 year old to fill out a form. They do it all the time in school. It\u2019s the schools decision to not let her attend for it. \n\nIt\u2019s not like YOU are punishing her. You\u2019re still celebrating her achievements. If I didn\u2019t fill out a form to go on my high school trip, I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to go. It\u2019s pretty simple, so not sure why so many others are saying YTA.", "Now she is missing out on a reward because she didn\u2019t fill out the paperwork on time. In a few years, if she doesn\u2019t fill out and file her tax returns on time the wrath of the IRS will come down on her. Better to learn the lesson now.", "NTA I get this is a lesson, doesn\u2019t matter how much you have done, if you don\u2019t do the mundane thing you don\u2019t get the reward, \n\n\n But in the real world yes, it\u2019s who you know, so if she had a friend in HR who could still get her in\u2026guess what\u2019s gonna happen? Lol \n\nSo maybe not an actual real world lesson you got going on here\u2026", "So your kid didn't do the thing that you were supposed to do and now she has to miss out? Did I get that right?", "This isnt a low stakes situation for her. She's still a kid. You could at least *try* so she knows her feelings matter more than your \"rule.\"", "INFO: Hmm... why didn\u2019t she do the paperwork was she out hanging with friends or was she home studying and doing homework and got overwhelmed? I want to know the reason why she didn\u2019t complete it in time, even though she\u2019s a top achiever in school, when that requires you to be vigilant about your academics. \n\nAlso instead of you not doing anything maybe ask her to write an essay to the secretary explaining and asking vs you going up there. If she wants to handle it like an adult, I think a thoroughly thought out written letter to the secretary would be better than her not voicing her concerns. Cause then if the secretary still says no than it would be more of a teaching point cause those are the rules in the adult world, you don\u2019t do the paperwork in time things won\u2019t go as plan. So maybe to give her your support in that way but still being realistic with her", "OMG MOTHER OF THE YEAR!  Seriously, you rock. When we fix our kids\u2019 things, they never learn to manage it themselves. It sends a message that we support their helplessness. She is old enough to complete the form, and I\u2019m sure had she asked for assistance (is this completed correctly, mom?), you could have absolutely provided support. Since she didn\u2019t do her part, she gets the natural consequence of learning that she needs to follow up when she\u2019s supposed to. I would let her know that as she ages, more things like this will happen. Letting her know that if she tries, and asks for help, you can support her. If she doesn\u2019t even try, why should you enable this?\n\nLessons hardest learned are best remembered. It\u2019s not too harsh. NTA. \ud83e\udd47", "NTA - you're right that this is a low stakes situation. She misses out on a party because she didn't RSVP. I would assume they still give them their award/prize regardless of attendance because there would be people who aren't attending due to a conflict.\n\nI teach high school so I know just how many reminders get sent out for things like this. They would've had emails. There would have been announcements in the PA every morning. This is on her to complete. It's not even paperwork you can do for her really because she never gave it to you. It's not like she handed you a permission slip and you lost it and forgot.", "NTA. Next time she\u2019ll do the paperwork. This is the lowest stakes way to learn that deadlines exist, if you want it you do it, and that help is available but words must be spoken BEFORE it\u2019s to late. This will help her later, she\u2019s just upset right now.", "I was also wondering this.", "Eh, OP's kid is a freshman in HS.  She is not a 1st grader.  Talk with empathy to her, but don't treat her like a young kid.  Mock acting and Play is a childish idea.  And this idea puts her friend on the spot when this is something she can learn at home with discussion.  Can you imagine if every kid and their parent went to the school admin to \"mock teach a lesson\"?", "I do wonder how many people saying it's lying have been also so honest as to never tell their children Santa exists.   \n\n\nIsn't telling kids \"if you're good, santa will bring you a gift\", as one commenter said \"creating a bigger issue down the track when it does come out\"?", "According to her she forgot about it and kept pushing it off when she saw reminders.", "At the beginning of the year I did the paperwork with her, she was taught. Then pulled back, still did physical reminders until around Easter, we were at email reminders when this happened from me and the school.\n\nShe has a school email and she ignored a lot of emails asking about it, though according to her she did read mine though", "You\u2019re completely missing the point. \n\nBethany missed the deadline for her paperwork. That has consequences.", "It might be a low stakes issue for you, but being recognized for getting a 4.0 after working super hard for a year is a huge deal and could be a high stakes issue for her.", "If I weren\u2019t friend with her I couldn\u2019t do anything tbh, she rarely makes exceptions especially after the invites are out", "No, i cannot imagine if every kid and their parent went to the school admin.  \nHowever here it's the friend of OP, so a very different situation.   \nAfter all, OP is the parent and she chooses whatever works best for her and the child.", "Exactly. This is what smart and loving parents will do: recognise when you can learn from a situation and when you actually need REAL help.", "Off topic but there is a school of thought amongst parents that you absolutely shouldn't tell kids that father Christmas is real as when they find out they will never trust you again.\n\nThe fact that no adult seems to have had their faith in their parents irrevocably tainted by believing in him is neither here nor there.\n\nI love the scenario idea - kids will believe anyone over their parents!", "You\u2019re so wrong. Adults ask for favors all the time. The correct response would have been to tell her to complete the paperwork and let her go speak to the secretary herself. She could apologize for not meeting the deadline and ask if she could turn it in now and still participate. That\u2019s what adults do. They get extension on their taxes, they ask for exceptions and most of the time the person will try to work with them.\n\nWhy? Because we have all been there. We have all been caught in the tide of responsibilities and missed something. It wasn\u2019t an important graded assignment - clearly she never dropped the ball on any of those - it was red tape paperwork.\n\nSpeaking as a person who works with children. YTA", "I get that you feel this is gonna teach her a life lesson about turning in paperwork but also it\u2019s a huge deal to get a 4.0 and it makes sense that she is devastated to not go. Being an adult is about learning to do the little adult things sure, but this event might not be important to you as an adult but be SUPER significant to her. Kids make mistakes learning along the way. In the very least you should say you missed out on the ceremony and that\u2019s your loss for not filling out the paperwork but let\u2019s have a little family celebration to celebrate your achievement.\n\nIn general, kids do well when they are encouraged and getting good grades at that age can really encourage her to work hard and potentially free her future up to do what she wants to do and have a great snowball effect for her life. I feel that you\u2019re getting so caught up in \u201cbeing right\u201d and \u201cteaching a lesson\u201d that you\u2019re forgetting what actually will be super important for your child in the long run.", "I dunno this seems weird to me. I get that 'paperwork is important' but she's a kid and she worked her ass off to get decent grades probably mostly just because she wanted to impress you. I'd give her a break on this one, poor kid probably just forgot, shit happens and another good thing to learn as an adult is that it's not always what you know but who you know, it's helped me out a bunch of times!", "She also *had the highest grades*. Cut her some slack.", "my boyfriend had a situation like this, this month. he forgot a important document for job in the printer. it was my day off and I was brought to him and he is an adult you know why? because everyone makes mistakes and that's not a reason to close the door on someone in need\nHer daughter made a mistake, she asked for help from her mother who refuses her help.\nit just says: if you made a mistake and you need help, don't trust your mom", "If it was that big of a deal she wouldn't have pushed it off for so long. \n\nNta.", "Then that's that.

OP would give the secretary friend a small heads up that they\u2019re not actually asking for the favor and then the secretary would explain to the daughter the very real and truthful rules and why they exist, only leaving out that she *could* break the rules for the daughter. That\u2019s a terrible lesson for a kid to learn. I knew a girl in my high school who\u2019s parents got her out of everything with money and calling in favors and she was very entitled and kinda mean and I doubt she\u2019s become a very self-sufficient or kind adult.", "I heard that!   \nMy sister has a 9 yo daughter who is so pure and naive, she still believes in Santa.   \nAt the same time, it's clear from her character that she will get super mad at her parents when she finds out Santa does not exist and it has been the parents all along hiding her presents. My sister really fears the day she'll find out and does not know how to navigate the situation.", "That is different, when you brought it, it was still on time. The only one affected was you.\n\nYou didn't have to ask a friend to break the rules.", "You live on the internet or have negative feelings about something that has nothing to do with this situation to respond this way.

That's exactly how I meant it.   \nI maybe shouldn't have used the word \"play\", so I am glad you understood how I meant it.

At that point, you might not know they\u2019re in a situation where you would consider it \u201cappropriate\u201d to offer help. \n\nSpeaking from my own experience, that doesn\u2019t exactly foster a close and/or trusting relationship with one\u2019s parents.", "Why can\u2019t they?

As I read more of your comments I\u2019m not surprised that your daughter is a perfectionist going for a 4.0 because of your harsh and un-understanding parenting style.
