To me, all of this made me feel like he had something to hide.\r  \nSure enough, I was right. My brother confessed to my family that he has feelings for coworker. My parents told him that being honest was the right thing to do, and that they just want him to be happy. I felt that the sudden honesty toward everyone was strange, and I figured that he must have gotten caught. \r  \nFinally, I reached out to my sister-in-law. My sister-in-law caught him cheating by looking through his phone.

Wow, your parents are soooo \"classy.\" May I make a suggestion for the seating chart at your wedding? Table 1 is mom and dad, brother, coworker as his plus 1, the biggest gossip in your mom's social circle, and also the most religious people they know.  Table 2 is for SIL, nephew, and the 5 most attractive and/or wealthy single guys you know.", "NTA keep the relationship with SIL, she's the reason your kids will see their cousins.", "NTA. Your brother cheated on his wife then lied about it to make himself look better. Your parents care about your brother, but that doesn't mean they should ignore his poor behavior and take part in it. Good job for supporting your SIL.", "NTA- Sounds a lot like my divorce as a result of my spouse\u2019s infidelity with a coworker. They both led a smear campaign against me to his family and as such, I\u2019ve been completely cut off from my in-laws of 17 years. Keep supporting your sister in law. It will make a big difference in your nephew\u2019s life.", "Gross.  NTA.  Your parents are probably embarrassed by your brother\u2019s actions and subsequently defensive.  They\u2019re lashing out at you because they want to blame *someone* and because you have your shit together you can take it.  Uncool.", "NTA Your parents raised your brother thinking he could do no wrong, and now his children have  had their home torn apart. Right is right; wrong is wrong. He should have just owned it instead of wasting everyone\u2019s time with his embellishment.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to side with someone just because they\u2019re related to you when their actions are morally reprehensible. If your brother is indeed on a smear campaign, it\u2019s probably getting to your nephew too. \n\nGood on you for being a positive influence. Your SIL and nephew are going need it by the sounds of it.", "NTA. . . It is natural for the immediate family, especially parents, to \"support\" their screw up (son in this case). I have worked in law enforcement before and in spite of the horrible crimes the majority of them still had family \"supporting\" them. It seems innate... You're a rare person who doesnt buy into the crud.... You're NTA, the family needs to get over the fact that he messed it up.", "NTA. You value faithfulness in relationships, which you have every right to do. You have a right to stand by your morals. I think your parents are TA for their \u201chope you will be kinder to your future children\u201d comment.\n\nAlso, why do they tell you to mind your own business when they don\u2019t? They support him. They\u2019ve taken a side. And yet when you take a side, the one they don\u2019t like, then you should mind your own business.", "NTA. The only \"classless decision\" I see here is your parents saying it's fine for their son to be a cheater and that the people who are directly affected by his AH behaviour don't deserve to know.\n\nYour brother has already made things ugly. I hope your SIL takes him to the cleaners and keeps her kids safe from poor morals.", "NTA, your entire family sucks and good for you for standing up for your SIL.", "NTA. Something very similar happened in my family.  I supported my SIL 100% because my brother cheated.  He acted like he could just dump his original, start up a new relationship and insert her into our family.  Luckily, we all agreed he was acting like a s*it head and barely spoke to him for a while.  I had to have multiple conversations, telling him that his ex wife was one of my best friends for close to 20 years and that would not ever change.  Stick to your guns and support your SIL.", "NTA. And honestly, thank you for being a good person have having your SIL's back.", "NTA You know they should support both your sister in law and their lying, cheating, neglectful son.", "NTA \n\nGood for you making the decision to be a good aunt (& uncle to be) to your nephew. He\u2019s going to need support because your brother is a git.", "NAH\nLoyalty and Integrity are BOTH virtues.   They're both important.  But if you don't have Integrity than your loyalty is worthless.  Balancing the two can be tough. \nYour parents are not having any more children.  You and your sibling(s?) are all they have.  They want a happy family as they age.   It's reasonable for them to support their son unconditionally.  They're full of loyalty.  Carrying your SIL's grudge is not your job.   But that integrity is a virtue.  \nA tough call.  Decide if you want to be close to your brother in 10, 15,30 years.   This decision matters.   \nGood luck", "I think it depends on what you mean by \u2018support\u2019. There is nothing wrong with you letting your former SIL know you feel she was wronged and you are not ok with your brother\u2019s actions. There is also nothing wrong with continuing a relationship with your brother. It\u2019s clear he knows you don\u2019t condone cheating. What happened has happened and no one can change that. I don\u2019t know how you would or wouldn\u2019t \u2018support\u2019 a new relationship. I guess maybe by opening yourself to a relationship with the new girlfriend? You certainly don\u2019t have to do that. But their divorce is also between them so your SIL doesn\u2019t need you to fight her moral battles nor does your bother need you to blindly tell him his happiness is more important than his cheating.", "YTA for taking sides.   Not your marriage, not your business.  \n\nYou can support your brother and the fact that he is no longer in love with his wife and made the decision to move on.    He had zero obligation to tell you that he got caught having an affair.    \n\nYou can support your SIL as well.    And you can support her without accusing  your brother has of launching a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against her, and without jumping to wild conclusions about why he was hoping to be able to reach divorce/ custody agreements without the help of attorneys.", "ESH:  Why are all of you arguing about who's right and who's wrong. It's not your relationship, take whoever side you want but I don't get why you're mad at your parents and their mad at you because you disagree.  \n\nJust understand they will always back their son and you on the other hand are more logical.
