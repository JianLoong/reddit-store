I'm assuming he's going into grade 6 and a new school which makes sense for a computer.  The academics may be much higher than his last school.  And the computer will be a valuable addition to his education.  At this age he may not have needed a top of the range model though.\n\nOne way round this is to say to his mom is that you will likely upgrade the computer in 3-4 year times and his little brother can have it if your son is okay with passing it down to him.  He will be 10 at this point and in a similar position to your son now.  A top of the range computer now, may be similar to a lower spec'd current machine in 3-4 years time so he's not actually disadvantaged.\n\nThis is not about a disparity between the kids and their presents but about needs at different ages.  Your son is older and 'needs' a computer for school work.  The 6 year old doesn't.  He will probably get the benefit of playing some games on it though.", "NTA... And thanks for having little brother over on occasion.  Yes, this will be difficult for little brother as he gets older. Could you have spoken to mom ahead of time so she could have focused on something extra for little bro? Or she could have prepared an explanation.  \nPlease continue to make efforts to consider your son's and his brothers feelings. Think of it as a gift to your son.", "NTA they decided to have another child. More children means each child has access to fewer resources. It\u2019s not like they involved you in that decision (of course, why would they) so they shouldn\u2019t expect you to ask them to buy off on what you do with your resources either. If there\u2019s tension, then they\u2019re just going to have to step up and parent instead of being lazy about it. 6 is old enough to understand \u2014 children aren\u2019t dumb. In my circles children don\u2019t receive certain things until they reach a certain age. They can promise their child a laptop at a certain age. The parents will have years to save up.\n\nI don\u2019t see anything about your child flaunting the gift or acting mean otherwise. That\u2019s worth acknowledging.\n\nIf they want to give their child more, the part-time worker can get a full-time job as many people do.", "NTA.  She could get her kid a $40 cheap notebook to play age appropriate games on or learning apps. The 6 yr old will not likely know the difference yet.", "If you are doing a good chunk of heavy lifting for your son, you are being a good dad.  Your care and concern for his brother makes you a good person.  \n\nThe kids are different ages and at different stages.  6 yo doesn't need a laptop, but your son does.  Little kids get hand-me-downs and that can help the family financially.  In a few years, the little guy might inherited that device when big bro upgrades in high school.", "NTA.", "NTA her kid isnt your kid. If she wants to buy fancy things she and her husband should get better jobs. End of story", "Yta\n\nYou could explain to us the difference in income but failed to understand how this creates tension between the kids. This is you flexing you money and showing that for you and the kid: money is no issue", "YTA for breaking your agreement instead of re-negotiating it, and having your kid surprise his mom with it. \n\nI'm not saying you're wrong to buy him a laptop, but you clearly knew that this purchase would conflict with the longstanding agreement that you've both abided by until this time. I think you would have been in the clear if you'd just called her first and said, \"Look, I think it's time for the boy to have a laptop, and I would like to buy him one...\", and then hashed out whatever agreement with her the two of you could have come to as reasonable adults. (E.g., the laptop isn't \"for Christmas\", it's a school supply. The laptop is \"from both of you\". Now that he's older, you amend the old agreement to have exceptions for anything related to school or sports. Whatever.) \n\nAs it is, you were an AH to your ex by breaking your agreement instead of re-negotiating it with her, you were an AH for not discussing such a large and life-changing purchase with your co-parent, you were an AH to your kid by making him the one to be the messenger for your AH move, and frankly, you were an AH to yourself by breaking your word like this in this sneaky way. In addition to it not being honorable, it's also not very strategic. You're paving the way for your ex to start breaking agreements that she doesn't like.", "Sounds like he's going into middle school, but still sounds like it's a necessity.", "Thanks! I\u2019ve talked about this with my son indeed, which is also why, for example, some of his toys generally stay here and he doesn\u2019t take them there. Additionally, lots of his old toys that he\u2019s gotten too old for go to his little brother (which he then decides to give, not me) because he still enjoys them, which is logical with a 5 year age gap. He has now, at age 11, come at a point where even if he doesn\u2019t flaunt, he does want to sometimes take more stuff with him, because, well, it\u2019s his stuff.", "We\u2019ve talked about doing such gifts together indeed, but that creates the logical problem that his little brother sees his mom giving him expensive stuff, and then not him. That would actively make the situation worse.", "At the schools here, the laptop isn\u2019t required to be at school, so the only traveling the laptop will do is from his one home to his other and back.", "The kid is still away from high school though.", "I could, but they\u2019ve always declined any financial help I\u2019ve offered them. It\u2019s a pride thing I suppose, which I get.", "I think it seems like you're very concerned about doing the right thing and you're communicating well with your son, which is great! \n\nBut maybe you're feeling guilty? Just focus on the fact that you owe it to your son to give him what he needs to succeed, and to teach him to be understanding of others.  And your ex should understand that and do the same for her son. \n\nIt's not fair to your son if you hold back for sake of others and who knows, down the line it might lead to resentment of you and your ex's family if you don't help your kid when you can.", "But that\u2019s already happening right now. His brother is getting things that he doesn\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t really matter who gives it because the ultimate feeling is the same: He has a brother but they\u2019re not equals. \n\nBut also, he\u2019s 6. He\u2019s old enough to understand what it means to earn a living. You and your ex certainly live in different houses, drive different cars, can afford different things. He\u2019s not oblivious to that. He knows you\u2019re his brother\u2019s dad and not his and he knows there\u2019s a difference there.\n\nHe might be sad about this fact, disappointed even, and has every right to, but he also has to understand it.", "I mean it's a laptop. What is a 6 year old gonna do with a high end laptop? Watch youtube kids? You're fine but what did your ex mean about \"tension\"? Like the half brother is jealous and throwing a tantrum? Or is your ex and her husband just pissed off and taking it out on you and your son?", "You could always do it and say it's for his brother so they both have something. At least then the parents won't feel as much of it being a charity case but just you trying to be fair to both kids"]}
