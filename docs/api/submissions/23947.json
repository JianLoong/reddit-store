They were upset I did not attend lunch with them to celebrate my husbands mom. I, again, told my husband to go which he did and I went with my family and introduced the baby to my grandparents.

My grandfather was recently diagnosed with tongue/mouth cancer and this was the Sunday before he started chemo/rad on the following day so I wanted him to be with the baby too. I\u2019d like to add I saw her that following weekend to take her her gift! \n\nProbably the most controversial that may make us the AH? A bridal shower for the SIL. This was happening at 10am when I had a 3wk old who slept in 10 minute increments all night. The bride told me not to worry about attending, she just wanted me to know I was invited. We also had plans late that evening (9pm) to attend a dinner for my husband\u2019s best friend. My husband hadn\u2019t seen his friends in 11 months so even though I really did not want to go because I was tired and self conscious about my body, we went. We left the baby with my in-laws that same night. Well during the argument my MIL says \u201cyou didn\u2019t go to the bridal shower even though you\u2019re new to the family and have to prove yourself a little bit but you had no problem leaving the baby and going to the bar\u201d this is where we ended the conversation, got in our car, and left.

We had plans to visit my grandfather because my husband hadn\u2019t seen him at all since he started treatment. We asked my in-laws what their plans were but since they were traveling that day nothing definitive was made until the morning of. We left my grandparents a little late and it\u2019s a long drive back home. We called them while they were out to lunch to see if we can still stop by but they were already seated and ordering so we said we\u2019d bring dessert over afterward. Since they had just traveled they said they wanted to rest but they\u2019d call when they were up. They never called. They said their feelings were so hurt that we didn\u2019t attend lunch.

Just enjoy your baby and do what is best for them.", "It\u2019s okay for Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day to be just for your nuclear family and stop participating in the circus. Celebrate with them another time, buy gifts, acknowledge them but there\u2019s no reason you should have to bend over backward with a newborn to adhere to their wishes. They sound pompous and the mil is impossible to please.", "NTA\n\nThese people are toxic AF", "NTA", "I think you need to face the reality that you could avoid speaking with your in-laws for the next 20 years, and they will have plenty to say about you to others. That's just the way they are, and reflects on them, not you. What horrible people! They're certainly not providing any incentive for you to actually *want* to be a part of the family!\n\nGood luck, OP. I hope your husband stands up to them some more to give you a barrier between them and their vitriolic attitude.", "The concept that you have to prove yourself to be allowed into the family is especially toxic.

You'd even be NTA without a newborn to take care of.\n\nThese people are like Miss Grundy, Archie and Jughead's teacher, eager to exert discipline over every infraction.\n\nEnough, already! Tell them to get off your case or you're going to ban them from your life. Jeely Kly, when does it stop? You don't have to go to all these events, really you don't. What are they going to do, other than huff and puff?\n\nWouldn't you like a day or two where you don't have to go anywhere? Baby is sleeping, lemonade's in the pitcher, Debussy on the player...peace.\n\nAnd you know what peace really is? No in-laws.", "NTA. Your IL are entitled and think you should walk on eggshells to prove you understand the huge fortune of having married inside their family.\n\nBut this is not a fortune. Parents willing their son to spend mother day apart from his fresh-mom wife are not a good family. People not aknowledging cancer are definitively not a good family. \n\nYou're new and have to prove yourself so prove them you take no bs.", "You became family the moment you married your husband. You don\u2019t need to prove anything. Secondly, newborn and husband get priority they should know this. Tbh they sound like spoiled children who never got told no. Seriously go lc and don\u2019t visit mil on Mother\u2019s Day ever.", "NTA. You\u2019re not really supposed to have newborns around others before their two month vaccines. We didn\u2019t go anywhere or do anything. We certainly didn\u2019t send our baby to hang with the in laws. Newborns have no immune system- they get sick from everything. A fever means an automatic spinal tap. Maybe your in laws need a refresher on basic newborn safety?  Also if I didn\u2019t know for sure everyone at an event was vaccinated, baby didn\u2019t go, period. My spouse works with sick babies and we\u2019re not risking any of that on our own kids. On top of that, you just had a baby. You need to recover. It takes way longer than 3 weeks. I couldn\u2019t even ride in a car for 6 weeks. You\u2019re more generous than most people are with their newborn they can get over it.", "If you go to a function for this side of the family, and they say something nasty/pushy I think that you and DH and baby should get up and leave.

I\u2019m glad you aren\u2019t allowing them to walk all over y\u2019all.  Congratulations and good luck.", "NTA.

Even if you were not a new mother yourself, you have your own mother.", "Maybe your husband would also like a break from his toxic family.\n\nMy mother is toxic too. But my in laws are lovely. We go visit them when we can, we call them, we send the kids to my sister in law for the occasional sleepover. \nI grudgingly pick up my mother's calls sometimes and see her as little as possible. Last Christmas she wasn't even invited.\nMy whole life I haven't been good enough for my mother, but my in laws accepted me and treated me with respect and inclusion from the very start.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that you can simply exclude her and hang out with whatever family you do like. In either family. You don't have to 'prove' yourself, and you don't have to play her stupid games. Just... don't. You can even tell her you aren't playing her stupid games. Don't engage her beyond that.\n\nNTA.\nAlso it is utterly ridiculous to expect a new mother to do anything.", "Nta Cut them off. Too much drama and entitlement. They need to prove themselves to you if they want to be in yours and your babies life", "NTA, the in-laws sound annoying. \n\nHowever, do you get along with your SIL? If so, she might be a bit sad that you skipped her bridal shower on the same day that you dropped your baby off with her parents and went to hang out with friends. It could be worth checking in with her and make sure there are no hard feelings.", "Wow Good luck. That is some family. You and hubs are NTA. You are your own little family and get to decide what you will do in life.", "Good Lord, how thick headed are these family members who think you just haul a newborn around wherever they THINK you to be?  You first through ten priorities should be that baby/husband and screw what those family members think.  Keep that child away from your family for awhile...  NTAH.", "NTA. This sounds a lot like my in laws. For a long time my SIL and MIL especially would be angry/irritated if we didn\u2019t go to something. We didn\u2019t even have the newborn excuse, we just didn\u2019t want to go. I realized a long time ago it doesn\u2019t matter what I do. They will always find something to criticize. Worry about your own little family OP. As long as your husband has your back, you will be fine.", "NTA. They are setting you up to be the failure. Nothing you can do is going to make them happy.  It sounds like they are upset that they cannot control you...which may be something to keep track of.  I would do what you want to do and let your husband deal with them.", "NTA Stop talking to these assholes. The attitude that a neq mom is \"new to rhe family\" and has to \"prove\" anything is rank bullshit. You will never be enough for them so do not try. From now on: husband talks to them, you do not.

Let your husband do all the communicating in the future. No doubt they think your family missing events is all on you.\n\nYour in-laws have to understand that now you and the baby are his immediate family. \n\nMost parents and in-laws are more understanding about the demands on new parents and try to work around your schedule. They should be able to understand how sleep deprived you can be in those first months. They should also understand that there are two more families involved, yours and his, and you will want to be as fair as possible in splitting time.", "NTA. Never set  yourself on fire to keep other people warm. Go to things if you want to and can go. Do not go if you cannot go or simply do not want to. Your husband needs to tell his parents the remark about you being new to the family was uncalled for and to step back. They should apologize to you. They are entitled AHs. When children become adults and start their own families things change. It sounds like your MIL and FIL  forgot that.", "NTA, this sounds exhausting to deal with. You need to tell your husband to talk to his family.", "NTA !\n\nI didnt even read the story... as based on the heading I dont need too, also the Mum of a newborn when my little one was 3 weeks old he got a cold a week later we were in the resus room of an ED as he had briefly stopped breathing due to snotty blocking his airways. We stayed for 5 day and then went home shortly returning for another hospital stay. \n\nNewborns are so very fragile and need our protection. \n14 weeks now and strong and healthy but I learnt that keeping them safe and germ free is more important then anything including appeasing family or friend who want to see them or you to attend something", "NTA\n\nYour child won't be a baby forever and you should cherish this time while you can.

Because they are really failing at being good extended family to you and your husband. \n\nNTA. His family sounds like the sort of selfish people where *their* family is the only one that matters. The only way to make them happy is if you and your husband and baby have your lives revolve around *their* wants and schedule, and that means that all holidays and celebrations need to be at their house and all vacations be with them. Any leftover crumbs of time can be spend with your extended family because, well, *they\u2019re* not important like your In-laws are. \n\nNTA. The only way to win this game is to not play. Drop the rope and stop catering to their whining, because they will never be happy with what time you offer. Do what you guys want to do as far as holidays and special events goes, and if they choose to get upset over that then that\u2019s their choice to make. Not your responsibility to bend over backwards to make them happy at all times.", "NTA", "Double fuck them, then. \n\nI might be an old cantankerous nurse, but I would immediately stop spending anytime with them. It is a hard job and some days I come home emotionally and physically wrecked. If you are going to be in my life and try to bring me more drama, you can just not be in my life anymore. I do not make space in my private life for petty bullshit.", "So my husbands sister, no. I do not. She\u2019s actually the cause of all of this in the first place but I was only allowed so much for the character count lol. The SIL in question is my husband\u2019s brother\u2019s wife.

If they are being obnoxious, rude, demanding, or otherwise unpleasant, reduce contact and spare yourself their maladjusted behavior. It is completely normal to make your little family unit the central focus of your time and attention.", "NTA. Your husband needs to have a discussion with them about realistic expectations.
