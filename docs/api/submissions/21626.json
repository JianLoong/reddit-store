He sadly had a lot of medical issues and left us much sooner than we hoped he will. \n\nHe was a really special boy. My wife who was back then my girlfriend (Quinn - 33) helped me adopt him from the shelter when he was just a few months old and we took care of him over the years together. Our kids (Maeve - 6F and Michael - 8M) grew up with Buddy and loved him very much. We took them to the vet with us and tried to involve them in Buddy's care as much as we could.\n\nSo at the end of the journey, we let kids pet Buddy until he rest in peace at the vet. As moms, Quinn and I just wanted our kids to understand what it meant to be mortal and how important it was to cherish every moment.\n\nA lady in her early forties max noticed the situation. She pulled me aside and had a whole speech, saying she saw what happened and was really disappointed. She called us heartless for making our kids witness that. She said we scarred them for life and now that trauma will forever be with our kids.\n\nI said I was comfottable with my mortality and I wanted to pass it on to my kids. She said multiple times how my wife and I were horrible parents and all. I was extremely emotional then. I told her I couldn't honestly care less about her opinion at the moment. The conversation escalated a bit and it ended with us leaving.\n\nAita here? Should I have acted differently?", "created_utc": 1688767408, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14tkxds/aita_for_telling_off_a_random_lady_after_an/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her opinion was just that - an opinion. She's no more correct than you about how your kids would react, and it wasn't her place to say a thing.\n\nMy dad always hated saying good bye. This was a relic of his British stiff upper lip upbringing, and reinforced during the war years.\n\nIn my childhood, I HATED the way that pets - dogs, in particular - would just disappear. When it came time, he'd take them to the vet, and then LEAVE THEM THERE. To die alone. I can see, and sort of forgive, his decision that this wasn't something for kids, but he was horrible for abandoning the dogs he loved at the moment they needed him most, just because *he'd* find it unbearably painful. Fuck that. That pain is a debt you start owing the moment you take a new puppy home.", "NTA at all.\n\nI was raised by a teacher, am a former early childhood educator, and hilariously, probably 3/4 of my closest friends have worked as vet techs or in animal rescue. And every single one of us would tell you that you did the right thing unless your children openly expressed that they did not WANT to be there to say goodbye to your family dog (in which case of course they should have been allowed not to be there, but I assume that would have been the case).\n\nDevelopmentally, by the time children are school-age, like yours, it's really important not to exclude them from these things because then that's how they experience them emotionally - at a disconnect. That doesn't mean that parents HAVE to have kids at an animal's side when the euth actually happens . . . that's a family choice . . . but for sure it's a valid decision to make. The important thing is that you communicate with them from start to finish about what's happening, why Buddy was being euthanised, and how being there with him was a wonderful thing that was going to help him go feeling loved and comforted right up until the last moment, surrounded by the people he loved, so he wouldn't be afraid. You gave them a wonderful, loving experience of death, and that is the OPPOSITE of what that awful woman suggested: it's not scarring, it's healing, and it's going to help them cope with the loss of their pet, because you can remind them that they helped to make even his last moments wonderful for him, and that they are generous-hearted, good humans. \n\nThe worst thing parents can do is just have a sick pet disappear and announce its death. It's so hard for kids to grieve that way, not knowing or understanding what happened. You are definitely NTA, and she doesn't know what she's talking about.", "NTA.  Who in their right mind goes into attack mode after witnessing what they just witnessed?!?!?!  \n\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss", "She offered an unprovoked opinion in a situation that was highly emotional and just none of her business. There's only one asshole here and it's not you or your wife. NTA", "NTA. The only thing you could have done differently is alert the vet so that this woman would have been escorted out. I imagine they don't take kindly to that kind of thing.", "NTA! That woman was rude and so out of line!!", "NTA.  You gave Buddy a peaceful transition surrounded by all of the people he loved the most.  You also have your children the opportunity to say goodbye to a beloved family member.\n\nI am so sorry that you had to make that decision, and that some random woman decided to make your grief about her.  She was absolutely out of line.\n\nSending your family much love during this very sad time.", "NTA - Not her place to voice an opinion on a deeply personal event (topic).  I am sorry this occurred during a meaningful loss and Buddy's transition.", "NTA. I am very sorry for your loss. I am sure you and your wife know your children better than a busybody stranger.  Makes sense to trust your judgement as to if your kids being with Buddy when he passed was something that would prove easier for them long term if they got a chance to say goodbye and share their love with him.", "NTA. The only acceptable comment is mine too: *I'm so sorry for your loss.*", "It\u2019s hard to do, but you should\u2019ve ignored her. NTA.", "NTA\n\nA few years ago one of my dogs had a plethora of issues related to his old age, so his euthanasia was planned ahead of time.\n\nThe vet made a housecall so that he could pass at home where he was comfortable, and he was surrounded by all  the family members of the household, including our other dog.\n\nI think it's important to involve kids in this because after all, we're all mortal so one day it's going to be us they're saying goodbye to. And while thay may not be the same as a pet passing, at least this natural process and the rituals, emotions, and behaviour has in some part been modeled for them.\n\nThis random lady can go kick rocks.", "NTA. Your children, your call when it comes to whether they had the maturity to process this or not. But be sure to have open ear. Had pets PTS and it can be a lot to process and sometimes only hits later. \n\nLady was an idiot. Whatever her thoughts,it had happened and approaching grieving people to rebuke them is never going to end well.", "NTA\n\nThe lion the witch and the audacity of that bitch, what a giant busy body narcissist. I find it incomprehensible to go up to a stranger at a time of such loss and tell them how to parent, what a waste of oxygen she is.\n\nYou are teaching you children about life, how precious it is and what will happen to everyone eventually. I commend you and your partner on your decision you are raising well adjusted young-ins.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss, disregard this troll of a person and process as you see fit as a family. Sending lots of you to you all.", "NTA. This is so personal, and totally depends on the family and the individual kids. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Lady needs to mind her own business.", "NTA.   I'd have told her to keep her trap shut. It's  none of her fucking business.", "Um how on earth did this lady notice anything? Every time I've had a pet euthanized at the vet, it's always a very private setting. \n\nINFO", "NTA\n\nYou know your kids. She doesn't. There are some kids that seeing something like that would absolutely freak out and traumatize. There are others who it would be important for them to be there to say goodbye and be there with their beloved pet. You are their parent. She was an idiot who didn't know when to keep her trap shut.", "NTA", "[removed]", "Nta I'm sorry for your loss, you were grieving and it is better to letthe kids know what happened than it us to hide the fact that their dog who was with them since birth isn't with them anymore. In fact it is more traumatizing to not tell them the truth plus it wasn't that women's business how you raise your kids", "NTA\n\nWhile there are arguments for and against taking your children to the vet for the euthanasia, it's no one's business but yours and your wife's.\n\nSorry for your loss", "NTA. Nobody asked for her opinion.", "I'm sorry for your loss and that some idiot made it worse.\n\nNTA at all.  The busybody woman was an over-the-top AH in multiple ways - intruding during a meaningful, tragic time in your family, telling you how to parent your children, and trying to put her philosophy/theology (about dogs?) on you.\n\nFWIW, we made the same parenting choice you did - we were all there when we had to put our first dog down at the vet and had our 5-year old there.  It was all peaceful and done outside, on the grass under the trees at the vet's office.  I was crying and that bothered our son a bit, but that's an important lesson, too, right?  That men can cry, that everything / everyone eventually dies.  I remember being 6 or so and a dog died of old age and I asked my mom why dogs died while people didn't - it seemed unfair.  I'd been so sheltered that I didn't know that people die and it felt like quite a betrayal at the time to have not been told that little fact.  Our son was 2-1/2 when his infant brother died, so he was already well aware people can die.  We were open about it - how could we not be? I want to say, but my 70-year-old cousin lost his infant brother 67 years ago and somehow thought for years that the UPS man took the baby away.  I think openness and honesty is far better than whatever contrived story was told to a 3-year-old that he heard in that way.\n\nNow our kids are successful, well-adjusted young adults.  We could die tomorrow and be confident that they're set to have good lives with only muted versions of the family angst that we'd inherited from their grandparents.", "First, I'm so sorry for your loss of Buddy. That pain is terrible. \n\nI guess I would need to know... did you ask your kids if they wanted to be part of it?  We lost pets when our kids were about those ages...one wanted to be part of it, the other didn't and we respected both their wishes. \n\nAssuming you didn't force the kids to do something they weren't comfortable with, then absolutely NTA. How people feel it's their right to get involved with shit like this is beyond me. \n\nI'm so sorry his passing was marred by this experience.  My condolences.", "[removed]", "I'm sorry for your loss.  I find it incomprehensible that an opinionated stranger would interject herself into your family's grief to lecture you about her philosophy about children and death. Shame on her. \n\nNTA", "NTA I\u2019m so sorry. Anyone that has gone through this should know what an emotional time it is. The audacity of that women approaching you in this time of grief is unbelievable. Everyone handles this a little differently but I know Buddy was lucky to have such a loving family. You did what you felt was best for your family and it\u2019s absolutely not her business.", "NTA (so long as your kids agreed to be there)  I still remember being about 9 or 10ish when the cat I grew up with was going to be put out of his misery and I was deeply upset that I wouldn't be allowed to go to the appointment and say goodbye there! I'm still kinda cross about it, lmao. My mother thought it would mess me up. (I'd already lost 1 cat and 2 grandparents when I was younger than your youngest, so I was no stranger to the idea of death, but she was worried that watching a beloved pet gently die would be Too Much and she didn't want to deal with me. )\n\nBut it sounds like you have always involved your kids with Buddy's care and that included making sure he had a good death, surrounded by people who loved him. And you sound like you'll be there for your kids if they are upset and need to process the experience. Having good support to process stuff like this is really key to dealing with it well! If your kids wanted to be there, there was no reason to shield them from experiencing death. \n\nI'm sorry for your family's loss. I grew up from a weird morbidly curious child into a weird goth adult who had to take my own cat to the vet and make that call a few years ago and it was hard! But I take comfort in knowing I lessened her suffering. I miss her sometimes still, though it's more a fondness tinged with sorrow now. (I also got myself a stuffed animal to pet for those times when I needed a cat to pet. So not the same as having my cat there, but it helped a little. So free suggestion for you or anyone else with a pet-shaped void in their lives!)", "NTA. And how DARE she? Your children absolutely have the right to be present in the last moments of their beloved pet's life. They were able to see that he passed peacefully, and I'm sure that will be a comfort for them. You did the right thing for you and your family, and Random Woman (she was no lady) can GFH.", "They are YOUR children. You raise them with the morals & values you decide are important. How to deal with love, compassion & loss are things not really taught anymore. Growing up on a farm, we learned early about love, compassion & loss. I just never realized how painful it was going to be as a parent to watch your kids learn the same lessons you were taught at the same age.\nKeep being a fabulous parent.\nNTA", "Did your kids want to be there ? I think that\u2019s the most important question in order to pass judgement. My kids 10 and 12, we had to put our 12 year old and 14 year old dogs to sleep last year (put to sleep about 6 months apart due to old age). I gave them the option to be apart of the process at the vet, both times both kids declined. I didn\u2019t make them. Long as you didn\u2019t force this on kids Nta. Regardless the stranger had no business inserting herself into your situation.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat woman is a huge gaping asshole for intruding on your family's private grief like that with her unwanted (and WRONG) opinion.\n\nYou're fine and you did the right thing for your family and your dear Buddy. I'm so sorry for your loss.\n\nChildren deserve a chance to say goodbye in a meaningful way, and Buddy deserved to pass away surrounded by the love of his whole family. Would you keep them away from a dying human family member if they wanted to be there? It's no different. I think you have a great healthy attitude towards life and death and good for you for raising your kids that way.", "NTA. This woman saw a grieving family and thought the best course of action was to harass you. She deserved exactly what she got.", "NTA. I've been in that situation and had someone approached me with that BS I would have told them where they can stick their opinion", "Honestly she made it much more traumatizing than it needed to be. Totally NTA and I'd argue that this was fantastic parenting.", "My father HATED funerals because he'd suffer through them without crying when that was exactly what he was feeling.  When we put our first dog down, our 5-year-old son was bothered a bit to see me cry but I think knowing it's okay for men to cry is much better than the alternative.", "This. I felt it was my duty to be there as any of my animals took their last breath. I never wanted them to be alone\ud83d\udc94. OP I am sorry for your family's loss. Pets are cherished family members.

I'm tearing up just reading this because I had to put my 7 year old cat to sleep recently. It was the worst moment of my life but I'd do it again in a heartbeat so he'd know he was loved.

I didn't want to see him die.\n\nMy mom stayed with my siblings and my dad stayed with me outside until they let us know it was over.\n\nI'm so glad we were given the CHOICE to be there.\n\nOP, good on you for giving your kids the choice to be there.

I\u2019m sorry she inserted herself, if I witnessed that I would have told her where she could shove her sentiments. What a weird lady.", "NTA. That nosey woman should have been minding her own business.

We always went because we wanted to be with our dog who was like a family member as they passed. It was extremely sad but a memory that will last with me for ever - in a positive way. It taught me about the depth of human connection/love and how I\u2019m connected to nature, life and death.
