About 4/5 days later my SIL (brothers wife) also finds out she is pregnant.

I kind of assume their thought process was \u201cwell she didn\u2019t end up having a baby so we can use the name\u201d and never told our mutual family their plan before their baby was born because they knew my parents would say something to them, knowing I had loved that name for quite some years. \nWhile I understand you can\u2019t \u201creserve\u201d a name, couldn\u2019t they have picked literally anything else?

Especially since you had a miscarriage, you would be sensitive to this name.", "NTA\n\nYou lost the child you were planning on naming Cameron\n\nNaming their child Cameron only serves to remind you of the child you lost.  \n\nNormally, I would say you can't reserve a name and can't be mad if someone else chooses that name\n\nBut in this instance...what they did was just plain cruel.", "I\u2019m saddened to see the number of comments saying OP is TA. Those people must not have experienced the heart crushing grief of miscarriage. The use of OP\u2019s favorite name isn\u2019t even the most important issue here. It\u2019s the lack of recognition and respect for OP\u2019s grief and loss. While it\u2019s true that names can\u2019t be reserved, it was a heartless and insensitive move, bordering on cruel, for OP\u2019s brother and his wife to use the one name that OP cherished and had talked about for years. Especially since the child that was given the name was born within days of the day OP\u2019s baby would\u2019ve been due. It was an act of erasure that compounded OP\u2019s grief at a time she would\u2019ve been especially vulnerable.\n\nOP, there is nothing you can do about the name now. I recommend you find a therapist, one experienced in counselling about pregnancy loss, in order to work through your grief about the miscarriage and enable you to let go of the residual bitterness about your brother and his wife using the name. You also need to come to some sort of resolution regarding your relationship with your brother and his wife. \n\nI think it\u2019s important for you to exercise grace and forgiveness for your own sake, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to open yourself up to future betrayal. Learn from this experience. You wrote that you feel this has revealed your SIL\u2019s true colors. Honor that. Remember the poet Maya Angelou\u2019s wise words, \u201cWhen people show you who they are, believe them the first time.\u201d I suggest you not take SIL into your confidence ever again. Grey rock treatment may even be warranted here. I wish you love, light, and healing for your broken heart.\n\nETA:  NTA", "NTA. you don\u2019t own the name but i honestly do understand you. sounds like you and SIL had a good relationship prior to this, and you told her way in advance of the name you chose. \n\nthere may be an underlying issue here on her part. has she tried to one-up you before? is she the type that undermines you when you\u2019re excited about something? people find situations like this to be \u201ctrivial and petty\u201d but they\u2019re usually indicative of something deeper.", "NTA. It\u2019s very clear that you understand that names cannot be reserved but it\u2019s a low blow from your brother and SIL to name their child the same name as your miscarried child. If they spoke to you and asked about honouring your baby, that would be a different story but the fact that they hid it and sprung it on everyone including your parents makes them TA.", "NTA. Obviously they knew that would hurt you so they didn't even tell you. That was a line they shouldn't have crossed. For obvious reasons... Why would they do that... I'm so sorry.", "First of all, my condolences.\n\nNTA - Sure, you can't reserve a name legally or whatever, but your brother and SIL knew you wanted to name your unborn child Cameron. When they couldn't decide on a name for their daughter last minute, all they had to do was to not call her Cameron. Sounds like a pretty low bar to me.\n\nAnother way to look at it, you pretty much chose Cameron as the name for your unborn child. With the miscarriage you essentially lost Cameron, and then they decide that that's what they should name their daughter? Major AH move right there.", "NTA\n\nHad they had a modicum of compassion for you and at least told you ahead of time maybe it\u2019s be nobody\u2019s an a-hole. But this *is* cruel. They knew you had intended to use it. They knew you lost the baby. What kind of people are comfortable using a name under those circumstances? Maybe if it was a family name for her too, but even then she could have told you.\n\nSometimes I think people forget that this isn\u2019t a sub for asking if you CAN do something. It\u2019s a sub where you ask if you\u2019re an asshole for doing something. And if they have t reached out to you then they *know* what they did was cruel - I have a feeling your other family members may have told them too?\n\nThey didn\u2019t do anything \u201cwrong\u201d that they didn\u2019t have a right to do, but they most certainly are assholes.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like you were planning on naming your child Cameron for a long time, and that was well-known by friends and family. You even sent a text after learning they were pregnant, just reminding them. They had a long time to come up with anything else. \n\nThat alone should've been enough for them to steer clear, but the fact that you had a miscarriage and they took the name anyway is just disrespectful. Now any time you see or hear about the child, you'll be reminded.\n\nI think your response is perfectly reasonable. If they want to keep that connection with you, they could change the name. Legal to change in most states (assuming you are in US) for roughly 6-12 months without extensive paperwork. Seems like this whole situation is on SIL.\n\nSorry to hear about your loss, both with the miscarriage and of a friend, OP. I hope things get better for you.", "NTA. That\u2019s just cruel.\n\nThey knew you planned on using that name, then you miscarried your child, then out of nowhere they announce *that* name for their newborn. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry. There\u2019s no way this is an accident. If it was, they could have reached out and communicated their intentions at anytime leading up to this moment, even just to give you a heads-up. \n\n*Actions have consequences*, and their consequence on appropriating your dead child\u2019s name is you having no role in their child\u2019s life. You don\u2019t deserve to be retraumatised by being exposed to this constant reminder of your loss. I feel really sorry for your nephew, he got dealt really inconsiderate A-H parents.", "NTA\n\nAct like you are happy about it. Tell them, talk to family and post online how overjoyed by the fact that they are \"honoring\" the child you lost by naming their son after her. If you want to cry about it, by all means cry, but tell them you are moved to tears at the simple thought of their generosity. Bring it up ALL THE TIME. Call their baby Cameron #2. Ruin that fucking name for them.", "NTA- Look \"stealing\" baby names is a stupid thing people do but in this case you had always planned to name your child that. After you lost that child she had absolutely no fucking right to use that name for her kid. Either she thought she was going to honor your lost child but went about it the wrong way or she always wanted to use that name and took the opportunity to take it after you lost yours. Either way send her an email, letter, or whatever and call her out on this and cut her off completely.", "While I\u2019m a big proponent of you don\u2019t own a name, the fact that they purposefully hid the name because they knew how horrible it was to name their kid after the one you lost shows what kind of people they are. Nta and don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t use it if you want to have another child", "NTA. They could have handled this much better. You can\u2019t reserve the name, but they had PLENTY of chances to tell you they wanted to use it and didn\u2019t, and the fact they didn\u2019t despite knowing your feelings reeks of disrespect. Plus in this case it\u2019s not like it was just for an abstract baby never on the table, but one you planned to use for a child you recently lost. \n\n\nIn your shoes, I could probably forgive them using the name if they were just courteous enough to talk about it, ever, especially when it sounds like there was ears at least two times they could have naturally from the subject of names coming up. Any sign of the slightest sensitivity would be enough to want to retain the relationships. But I can see not wanting to have contact given all the factors. \n\nMy cousin used a name he knew I planned on for years and I outright told him I\u2019d still use it. But I realize a cousin is a bit different than a sibling. I mention this just because I think you should still use the name later if you still want.", "NTA-  I am very sorry for your loss and their lack of understanding.", "This is just cruel. I cannot believe they would do this to you. Honestly, the audacity. NTA, I would not want to speak to them ever again.", "NTA. I always hate reading stories about people fighting over a name but this isn\u2019t that situation.", "NTA. This was an act of cruelty.", "NTA that was intentional", "That\u2019s fucked up. You aren\u2019t the AH.", "NTA. Use the name Cameron for your rainbow baby regardless if it\u2019s a boy or girl.", "NTA \nYes you can\u2019t reserve a name but it\u2019s obviously insensitive of her and your brother. It\u2019s totally understandable to be upset especially since now if OP still names her child Cameron I\u2019m sure family members would make it a big deal especially SIL.", "This is a strange situation.  I know that (not really the same, but kind of) I have often considered a name for a pet, but upon actually finding the right pet, discovered that the name didn't fit it and named the animal something else.  Maybe.  *Maybe*... this was similar?  All those names were what they wanted, and then they \"met\" the baby and it was Cameron.\n\nKind of a stretch, but I'm trying to find **one good reason** they aren't complete assholes who chose the one name you and your husband specifically asked them not to use. In your shoes, I'd be pissed as hell.  The fact they haven't come to you and explained their behavior is what nudges them into asshole territory.  (have they?)  For now, NTA.", "NTA. I think that it's a weird move and I would honestly be pretty upset. I totally get where you are coming from.", "I just want to start with I\u2019m sorry for your loss. \n\nNTA your feelings are valid and your brother and SIL acted insensitively. \nYour husband asked them to not use the name and they \u201cforgot\u201d so that\u2019s on them\u2026 they sprung the use of the name on you after your loss because they knew what they were doing would upset you. \nBut as you said no one owns a name. There is no reason why you can\u2019t use that name so if it\u2019s not too painful for you then I would advise that you stick to your plan and use that name for a future child regardless.", "NTA. There are millions of other names and they just had to choose that one? What they did was incredibly cruel.

There is no calling \"dibs\" on a name. There was no point in them giving you notice they were using the name if you were just going to freak out, blow up their phone with texts screeching at them to change their minds, and recruiting family members to get them to change their minds.\n\nCameron is a *very common name*, for a girl or a boy. Plus, you had a hint when she said \"we're staying out of this\" and he didn't respond at all. That should have clued you in right there that Cameron was a name they were considering too.\n\nThey're probably being very understanding of the fact that you haven't been by to visit the baby due to your own loss, but if it's really just due to pettiness over the name, you should put spitefulness aside and go visit the baby.", "ESH\n\nYou can't reserve a name.  You don't know if you will ever name a daughter Cameron.  Maybe all your future kids are boys.  Maybe you have a daughter but change your mind.  I've known people who walked into the delivery room 100% sure on the name, only to take one look at the child and change their mind.  My godsister was supposed to be named Rose.  Her mom had wanted to name her daughter Rose since she was little.  Friends made a GORGEOUS hand-stitched rose quilt for the new arrival.  Only for her to come home from the hospital with a name that is about as far away from Rose as you can get.  It happens.\n\nAnd nothing is stopping you from using Cameron in the future.\n\nBut you lost a pregnancy that was due around the same time as this one.  They knew your attachment to the name Cameron.  They didn't have to publicly announce the name, but they should have privately told you of their decision to use the name.  Maybe there's a good reason for it, like SIL having a tie to the name she never mentioned because you were always \"claiming\" the name.  Maybe there isn't.  But in any case, they should have told you privately before moving ahead with the name, especially due to your recent loss.", "YTA bc A) you are blaming all of this on your sister in law, what about your brother? \nB) there are things you stop speaking to family over.

It works both ways.", "YTA\n\nNo one \"owns\" a name.", "YTA, I don't see the problem with kids sharing names, the names you chose aren't unique or special in any way. \n\nI was back and forth on it, and it might be a touchy subject due to your miscarriage, but you blew up your friendship over it.", "Gentle YTA.  You could have named your first daughter Cameron but chose not to, and it\u2019s not reasonable to expect people to avoid names the would like to use indefinitely just in case you might want to use the name with another child.  Plus there\u2019s is no reason the cousins can\u2019t have the same name so you can use Cameron too, but even if you couldn\u2019t, this is an awfully petty reason to blow up a family relationships. Finally, if it really is so egregious,  don\u2019t understand why you are blaming your SIL but not holding your brother equally accountable.", "I'm on the fence, I think NTA. \n\n\nNot because they shouldn't have named their kid Cameron though. But because they obviously purposely hid it from you knowing it would hurt your feelings. \n\n\n\nHere's my question though: if they had indeed told you, after your miscarriage, that they were gonna use that name, how would you have reacted? If you would've gotten mad, claimed ownership, used your miscarriage to guilt them, etc. then you can't really blame them as much for hiding it.", "YTA. There is no law saying that cousins can't have the same name. Once they are grown, they may never even be in the same room together. Besides, a name is not a property. You can't call dibs on it.", "YTA I had a beautiful girls name picked out. My BFF had a baby girl, and used part of that name.

Take time to take care of yourself.", "YTA, you don\u2019t own a name. They had every right to use it and were not wrong for doing so. You could still use the name if you have another baby.

You don\u2019t refer to the miscarriage as you losing a child. You call it a lost \u201cpregnancy.\u201d Which to me shows whether or not this was traumatic. I think you\u2019re disappointed but you didn\u2019t take it like a death of a child like some people who have miscarriages feel (mother and sister both felt like they lost a child. They didn\u2019t lose a pregnancy and would never refer to it that way). You don\u2019t sound like someone who is grieving. \n\nYou\u2019re disappointed someone used the name. You didn\u2019t name the lost pregnancy Cameron. If you did then you\u2019d be referring to your lost pregnancy as Cameron and you yourself would never consider using the name again for a future child. \n\nBased on that it\u2019s literally just a name.

Losing family over something you called dibs on is stupid.", "Yta", "NAH. I can see your viewpoint on this but I\u2019m wondering if the reason SIL never mentioned the name is because your husband said don\u2019t think about using it in a group text?\n\nWould you have been upset if you had not miscarried and you both named your babies Cameron?  \n\nI feel this is much deeper than a name and I really hope that you seek some help dealing with this.

I had a miscarriage and watched her carry her pregnancy and then use the name I would have wanted to use.. 4 days after I was due to give birth. I feel like it was more insensitive to use that name more than anything. It\u2019s not like I was never pregnant and just liked the name. I lost a baby I was going to use that name for. She got the baby and she got the name. I would never have done that to her.", "I couldn\u2019t be mad if they truly didn\u2019t know, like if I never talked about it in front of them or if I didn\u2019t lose a pregnancy. If it were a regular situation where they were pregnant and I wasn\u2019t, totally different story. So you\u2019re right, it\u2019s a constant reminder for the rest of all of our lives. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a temporary decision and something super easy for me to get over.", "OP, I don\u2019t know if this story will help at all, but I\u2019d like to share just in case it does. When I was pregnant with my third baby, my husband and I agreed on two names, one for a boy and one for a girl. But when my newborn son was placed in my arms for the first time, I just knew the name wasn\u2019t the right one for him even though it was one I\u2019d liked for years. My husband felt the same way. I suggested a name that popped into my mind, one we\u2019d never talked about before and my husband instantly agreed. It was the right name for our son and we had no second thoughts. Funnily enough, years later our son became very good friends with a nice boy who had the name we decided wasn\u2019t the right one. \n\nSo, maybe hold onto the thought that, as much as you liked the name Cameron, it might not have suited the baby you lost. I hope that might help you come to some sort of peace about it. Should you decide to have another child, when you get pregnant again, open your heart to new possibilities. \ud83c\udf08\u2764\ufe0f \n\nA word of advice: don\u2019t share baby names in advance. That doesn\u2019t have to be between anyone but you and your husband. \n\nAnother thing, someone mentioned this already but I wanted to echo it. It\u2019s very handy when your children have different initials. My three all had different initials, it wasn\u2019t a planned thing. It made it so much easier when plotting out our family schedule with appointments, soccer, baseball, piano, dance, etc etc. Friends who went with naming their 4 girls all \u201cJ\u201d names didn\u2019t have that same kind of convenience.

It will probably take a while to get through those emotions and i hope OP does. It\u2019s good of you to take responsibility for the less nice part of your comment. It\u2019s very mature, thank you:)", "Every time she hears that name, she will be reminded of her lost child. That will never go away. SIL would know this if she had the brains God gave a flea.

You can\u2019t expect someone to hold the same value as you do to your trauma, like I said before she doesn\u2019t own the name so they did not bring wrong by not telling her, cause they don\u2019t have to, or picking that name all together because again they don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s not fair to be mad at them for something like a name just because of what happened to OP and it would be wrong to say they are AH in their decision even with what happened to OP", "That is not the SIL fault, OP must learn to let that hate in her heart go cause that\u2019s not cruel or nasty IMO.", "You assume she remembered. You don\u2019t own a name.", "This is probably going to be a pretty bad comparison but you seem young so I think this might help you make some sense of it.\n\nImagine you have a crush on someone, your best friend tells you they\u2019re not that impressed by that person.

You start talking to this person more, you find things in common such as  movies and food that you both like, and you just can\u2019t get over how lucky you are this person likes you back.Then one day that person randomly stops talking to you, just full on ghosts you, pretty much blocks you on everything. The next time you see this person, they\u2019re dating your best friend who only expressed disinterest.\n\nAre you happy each time you see them or are you pissed? \n\nNow imagine that, but with life and death involved", "it\u2019s very easy to assume she remembered when her response to my mom telling her i was upset was \u201cwell they didn\u2019t use it\u201d", "You sound like you\u2019re projecting. If OP hadn\u2019t had a miscarriage, the situation would\u2019ve been different. But she just lost the child she was going to name Cameron and who would\u2019ve been born four days before SIL\u2019s. SIL would\u2019ve had to pick a different name then too, maybe she would\u2019ve given the name Cameron still, but in that case no major life altering loss would\u2019ve occurred.", "This is gonna sound really edgy but nah I wouldn\u2019t really care tbh. If crush sees something in best friend and wants to pursue something with them instead of me that\u2019s just life at the end of the day and they are free to do that if it\u2019s what they want for them.\n\nNot saying that what happened to OP doesn\u2019t suck cause it does but SIL isn\u2019t a villain for naming her kid what she did, however OP can still want to keep her distance if it bothers her and she\u2019s not an AH for wanting that cause it\u2019s her decision.\n\nTLDR there are no assholes here but to hold negative feelings for SIL is kinda weird since she did nothing wrong IMO", "Which could have been the answer whether or not she remembered\u2026 Being informed you were going to use it, even if she didn\u2019t remember would have the same response\u2026 It also doesn\u2019t change the fact that if you get pregnant again, you can still use it.", "Not projecting, responding. That\u2019s really irrelevant. It\u2019s sad for her, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that she doesn\u2019t own the name. The SIL may not have picked a different name, she may very well still have used the name she loved, and it would be no different than this situation. If SIL hadn\u2019t used Cameron I\u2019m sure OP would have next pregnancy, which completely counters the idea that it belonged to the lost pregnancy.", "Ok\n\nIf you think hiding the name of your child from everyone including your family until it\u2019s born because you know that every time your sister calls that child\u2019s name until one of them dies, it will remind her of her child that died who should be growing up along your child isn\u2019t a dick move, that\u2019s on you.", "Jennifer was the most popular name in the US for 15 years without including the similar names of Jen, Jenny etc \n\nWhen you have your next child name them what you want.

I've never felt more lonely than after my miscarriage last year. It feels like your body has completely let you down. It's incredibly traumatic. \n\nI also get that it's impossible for someone who has not gone through a miscarriage to get hier traumatic it is. They might have thought they were honoring the baby you lost by naming their baby Cameron. It might need nothing but good intentions.\n\nEdit: I'm also curious at why your anger is directed at your SIL and not your brother.", "YTA. It is a name, even if you hadn\u2019t miscarried, you have no claim on a name. It is also telling that you had a named picked out prior to even getting pregnant. And you picked the name not due to a special significance, but because you like how it sounds with your other kids name. Children are not fucking accessories. And you do not own any name. And what\u2019s more, you haven\u2019t even bothered to meet your niece/nephew because you are salty over a name. YTA 1000%", "Huge YTA even more so from you arguing with ppl on here and your nasty asf attitude towards \"I dont want the confusion of which child the family is referring too\". So fucking what,  its the end of the world there 2s Camerons.   You or your husband don't own a name, its a free world ppl can name there kids whatever the fuck they want. For your husband to throw down his dick and say this is our name you cant use it. Is nasty asf too, Shows you both need to grow the fuck up and the world doesn't revolve around you. And being pregnant again within weeks. Obviously the miscarriage wasn't that hard or bad. Sounds like you just want to keep pooping out kids     Maybe with that mindset that the world revolves around you,neither one of you need or deserve another kid. Get off your back, close your legs and grow the fuck up. I absolutely feel sorry for you and your kids.... My bad you only have 1, but going the rate you are you might have 20 by this time next year. Hopfully at least 1 lives.", "YTA. Names are names. Didn't get to use the one you chose for whatever reason? My condolences, but that's not SIL's issue, that's a you problem.\n\nHave you considered that maybe they did it in tribute to you and what you lost? I mean I don't think they did, but they might have.\n\nBut back to the name being a name thing, you can't reserve a name that none of your friends or families can't use, that's just stupid. If you like the name and want to use it, use it.", "Please don't do this... It's not the kid's fault, and this will make it feel as though it is. One set of my grandparents insisted on calling me the name they thought I should have been given until I was about five, and I just remember always feeling like I, personally, had done something terribly wrong. Don't do that too a little kid.", "I agree with the YTA judgement. It\u2019s \u201cinsensitive\u201d from the in-laws, yes, but they could have liked the name before and just didn\u2019t want to deal with the drama if they announced only after OP that they also liked the name. Also, they might have named their kid Cameron, too, even if OP didn\u2019t miscarry. It\u2019s not unheard of having kids with the same name within a family and it\u2019s petty being pissy over it. Could they have made the grand gesture of not naming their kid Cameron just to spare OP\u2019s feelings? Yes, but let\u2019s be honest: they\u2019re not obliged to make this kind of favour.\n\nIt\u2019s a very different case if they only did this out of spite but then they have bigger issues to deal with, naming a literal child a certain name only to hurt someone.", "And it\u2019s not like the name is taken now, they can name their next (hopefully not miscarried) child Cameron. I have nieces with the same name as mine and noone ever gave a fuck.", "My parents had a name picked for my brother and when he was born they both felt that he didn't \"look liked\" someone named Patric.\nIt might be the same for the brother and SIL", "So should you have kept your baby and your SIL lost hers, you would *not* have named her Cameron, because SIL wanted that name and lost her baby? \n\nI think SIL already had 'Cameron' chosen as well, and was sensitive enough not to pour on the stress during your pregnancy of telling you that.", "Your baby was never named.\nSorry, you have to get over your lost baby without giving her the blame.", ">know one name we ARENT using now\n\nI would do exactly the opposite and make sure I use that name!! You wanted it, you have it!! Don't let her think she's won by taking it from you!!", "I would literally use the name Cameron still if I were you. Your whole family knows damn well what that name means to you. It's not going to make a lick of a difference to the kids as adults if they have the same name.", "Use the name, when ever anyone asks why they have the same name, tell the truth, you've been planning on using this loved name for years, and your SIL also liked it so she used it. You don't need to be friends with her anymore. \n\nNTA.", "No no no.\n\nYou definetely should name the baby Cameron.", "Congratulations! If you love the name Cameron, use the name. They can just deal with it. It's very infuriating and unfortunate that your extremely traumatic and horrible situation revealed their true colors. Name your baby what YOU want and what feels right to you- they obviously gave zero shits about your feelings when they decided to name their baby that, so you can treat them with the respect they have given you.", "Oh it sounds like she knew *exactly* what she was doing. Cut her off (along with the bro if he goes along with her and doesn't act regretful). It sounds like you're a person who stuffs their feelings inside and is worried you might be overreacting. You aren't at all- this was seriously cruel and damaging,  not to mention intentional. Your mental health is worth so much more than trying to keep peace. NTA (obviously) and hugs and congratulations on your rainbow baby <3", "I wouldn't send them anything. These people sound ignorant and childish so I doubt they'll care.", "Really? I love the name Cameron for a girl and I knew of both boys and girls being named that when I was in high school. I'm 26 now.", "It's not going to \u201cruin\u201d anything for anyone \u2013 just like the current baby Cameron's name didn't actually \u201cruin\u201d anything for anyone. It's just going to be two cousins who share a name, which is utterly, perfectly, completely normal.", "Why is she petty? I seriously don't see any pettiness here.", "My uncle married a woman who had a son with the same name as his son. It was a little weird to figure out at first, but it was no big deal? Granted they were stepbrothers and not half brothers, but they lived together full time and were only a year or two apart. \n\n\nJust imagine how George Foreman\u2019s kids feel!", "A colleague once mentioned two couples she knew had pregnancies at the same time twice. One couple lost their first baby and the other lost the second. They both had a hard time but also kind of needed to be around each other. What a tragedy. \nOP, I'm sorry the memory of your baby Cameron was disrespected and your loss dismissed. NTA.", "You don't though. Your happiness and mental health doesn't need to take a backseat to your parents wishes. If they can't see exactly what has caused this they definitely don't warrant you bending over backwards to please them. You can still see your parents and have a relationship with them without having to make everything a huge family gathering. If you know your brother and wife will be there just don't go.", "I can just imagine \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude2d", "> he\u2019s the 2nd oldest son\n\n> & I\u2019m the last born. My parents have 6 children all together. My mom had 2 girls & 1 boy in her previous marriage, my dad had brother I\u2019m referencing & 1 girl in his previous marriage.. then my parents got together & had me.\n\nStill sounds like he's your father's eldest biological son?\n\n> Reason my brother didn\u2019t get his name was bc he was named after my dad\u2019s dad\n\nSo your brother was named after his father's father, and then he did the same with his son. Regardless of whether that was starting a new tradition or carrying on an old one it seems rather AH to begrudge him that.", "I lost a pregnancy very recently when my SIL was 4 months & I was 6wks. I now have PTSD as a result of the loss. I've been having panic attacks, cant leave the house or work & have been suicidal.Both my brother & sister are each expecting new babies & it fucking kills me. \n\nMy brother recently told everyone in the family they were expecting except for me. They probably weren't aware of the extent of my issues but they knew my situation & mum told him I was not doing well & didn't think I would take the news well. So they said they would tell me to my face or something.\n\nWell I opened up Facebook to a pregnancy  announcement & it set me off. They told everyone else & decided to just let me find out on my own & was thier hands of it I guess.\n\nI havnt spoken to him in months & he hasn't even reached out to me even after my mum & sister said he shouldn't have done that. It feels so good to be free of those people.\nDon't suffer for them, cut them loose."]}
