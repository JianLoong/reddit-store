Especially since you had a miscarriage, you would be sensitive to this name.", "NTA\n\nYou lost the child you were planning on naming Cameron\n\nNaming their child Cameron only serves to remind you of the child you lost.  \n\nNormally, I would say you can't reserve a name and can't be mad if someone else chooses that name\n\nBut in this instance...what they did was just plain cruel.", "I\u2019m saddened to see the number of comments saying OP is TA. Those people must not have experienced the heart crushing grief of miscarriage. The use of OP\u2019s favorite name isn\u2019t even the most important issue here. It\u2019s the lack of recognition and respect for OP\u2019s grief and loss. While it\u2019s true that names can\u2019t be reserved, it was a heartless and insensitive move, bordering on cruel, for OP\u2019s brother and his wife to use the one name that OP cherished and had talked about for years. Especially since the child that was given the name was born within days of the day OP\u2019s baby would\u2019ve been due. It was an act of erasure that compounded OP\u2019s grief at a time she would\u2019ve been especially vulnerable.\n\nOP, there is nothing you can do about the name now. I recommend you find a therapist, one experienced in counselling about pregnancy loss, in order to work through your grief about the miscarriage and enable you to let go of the residual bitterness about your brother and his wife using the name. You also need to come to some sort of resolution regarding your relationship with your brother and his wife. \n\nI think it\u2019s important for you to exercise grace and forgiveness for your own sake, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to open yourself up to future betrayal. Learn from this experience. You wrote that you feel this has revealed your SIL\u2019s true colors. Honor that. Remember the poet Maya Angelou\u2019s wise words, \u201cWhen people show you who they are, believe them the first time.\u201d I suggest you not take SIL into your confidence ever again. Grey rock treatment may even be warranted here. I wish you love, light, and healing for your broken heart.\n\nETA:  NTA", "NTA. you don\u2019t own the name but i honestly do understand you. sounds like you and SIL had a good relationship prior to this, and you told her way in advance of the name you chose. \n\nthere may be an underlying issue here on her part. has she tried to one-up you before? is she the type that undermines you when you\u2019re excited about something? people find situations like this to be \u201ctrivial and petty\u201d but they\u2019re usually indicative of something deeper.", "NTA. It\u2019s very clear that you understand that names cannot be reserved but it\u2019s a low blow from your brother and SIL to name their child the same name as your miscarried child. If they spoke to you and asked about honouring your baby, that would be a different story but the fact that they hid it and sprung it on everyone including your parents makes them TA.", "NTA. Obviously they knew that would hurt you so they didn't even tell you. That was a line they shouldn't have crossed. For obvious reasons... Why would they do that... I'm so sorry.", "First of all, my condolences.\n\nNTA - Sure, you can't reserve a name legally or whatever, but your brother and SIL knew you wanted to name your unborn child Cameron. When they couldn't decide on a name for their daughter last minute, all they had to do was to not call her Cameron. Sounds like a pretty low bar to me.\n\nAnother way to look at it, you pretty much chose Cameron as the name for your unborn child. With the miscarriage you essentially lost Cameron, and then they decide that that's what they should name their daughter? Major AH move right there.", "NTA\n\nHad they had a modicum of compassion for you and at least told you ahead of time maybe it\u2019s be nobody\u2019s an a-hole. But this *is* cruel. They knew you had intended to use it. They knew you lost the baby. What kind of people are comfortable using a name under those circumstances? Maybe if it was a family name for her too, but even then she could have told you.\n\nSometimes I think people forget that this isn\u2019t a sub for asking if you CAN do something. It\u2019s a sub where you ask if you\u2019re an asshole for doing something. And if they have t reached out to you then they *know* what they did was cruel - I have a feeling your other family members may have told them too?\n\nThey didn\u2019t do anything \u201cwrong\u201d that they didn\u2019t have a right to do, but they most certainly are assholes.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like you were planning on naming your child Cameron for a long time, and that was well-known by friends and family. You even sent a text after learning they were pregnant, just reminding them. They had a long time to come up with anything else. \n\nThat alone should've been enough for them to steer clear, but the fact that you had a miscarriage and they took the name anyway is just disrespectful. Now any time you see or hear about the child, you'll be reminded.\n\nI think your response is perfectly reasonable. If they want to keep that connection with you, they could change the name. Legal to change in most states (assuming you are in US) for roughly 6-12 months without extensive paperwork. Seems like this whole situation is on SIL.\n\nSorry to hear about your loss, both with the miscarriage and of a friend, OP. I hope things get better for you.", "NTA. That\u2019s just cruel.\n\nThey knew you planned on using that name, then you miscarried your child, then out of nowhere they announce *that* name for their newborn. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry. There\u2019s no way this is an accident. If it was, they could have reached out and communicated their intentions at anytime leading up to this moment, even just to give you a heads-up. \n\n*Actions have consequences*, and their consequence on appropriating your dead child\u2019s name is you having no role in their child\u2019s life. You don\u2019t deserve to be retraumatised by being exposed to this constant reminder of your loss. I feel really sorry for your nephew, he got dealt really inconsiderate A-H parents.", "NTA\n\nAct like you are happy about it. Tell them, talk to family and post online how overjoyed by the fact that they are \"honoring\" the child you lost by naming their son after her. If you want to cry about it, by all means cry, but tell them you are moved to tears at the simple thought of their generosity. Bring it up ALL THE TIME. Call their baby Cameron #2. Ruin that fucking name for them.", "NTA- Look \"stealing\" baby names is a stupid thing people do but in this case you had always planned to name your child that. After you lost that child she had absolutely no fucking right to use that name for her kid. Either she thought she was going to honor your lost child but went about it the wrong way or she always wanted to use that name and took the opportunity to take it after you lost yours. Either way send her an email, letter, or whatever and call her out on this and cut her off completely.", "While I\u2019m a big proponent of you don\u2019t own a name, the fact that they purposefully hid the name because they knew how horrible it was to name their kid after the one you lost shows what kind of people they are. Nta and don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t use it if you want to have another child", "NTA. They could have handled this much better. You can\u2019t reserve the name, but they had PLENTY of chances to tell you they wanted to use it and didn\u2019t, and the fact they didn\u2019t despite knowing your feelings reeks of disrespect. Plus in this case it\u2019s not like it was just for an abstract baby never on the table, but one you planned to use for a child you recently lost. \n\n\nIn your shoes, I could probably forgive them using the name if they were just courteous enough to talk about it, ever, especially when it sounds like there was ears at least two times they could have naturally from the subject of names coming up. Any sign of the slightest sensitivity would be enough to want to retain the relationships. But I can see not wanting to have contact given all the factors. \n\nMy cousin used a name he knew I planned on for years and I outright told him I\u2019d still use it. But I realize a cousin is a bit different than a sibling. I mention this just because I think you should still use the name later if you still want.", "NTA-  I am very sorry for your loss and their lack of understanding.", "This is just cruel. I cannot believe they would do this to you. Honestly, the audacity. NTA, I would not want to speak to them ever again.", "NTA. I always hate reading stories about people fighting over a name but this isn\u2019t that situation.", "NTA. This was an act of cruelty.", "NTA that was intentional", "That\u2019s fucked up. You aren\u2019t the AH.", "NTA. Use the name Cameron for your rainbow baby regardless if it\u2019s a boy or girl.", "NTA \nYes you can\u2019t reserve a name but it\u2019s obviously insensitive of her and your brother. It\u2019s totally understandable to be upset especially since now if OP still names her child Cameron I\u2019m sure family members would make it a big deal especially SIL.", "This is a strange situation.  I know that (not really the same, but kind of) I have often considered a name for a pet, but upon actually finding the right pet, discovered that the name didn't fit it and named the animal something else.  Maybe.  *Maybe*... this was similar?  All those names were what they wanted, and then they \"met\" the baby and it was Cameron.\n\nKind of a stretch, but I'm trying to find **one good reason** they aren't complete assholes who chose the one name you and your husband specifically asked them not to use. In your shoes, I'd be pissed as hell.  The fact they haven't come to you and explained their behavior is what nudges them into asshole territory.  (have they?)  For now, NTA.", "NTA. I think that it's a weird move and I would honestly be pretty upset. I totally get where you are coming from.", "I just want to start with I\u2019m sorry for your loss. \n\nNTA your feelings are valid and your brother and SIL acted insensitively. \nYour husband asked them to not use the name and they \u201cforgot\u201d so that\u2019s on them\u2026 they sprung the use of the name on you after your loss because they knew what they were doing would upset you. \nBut as you said no one owns a name. There is no reason why you can\u2019t use that name so if it\u2019s not too painful for you then I would advise that you stick to your plan and use that name for a future child regardless.", "NTA. There are millions of other names and they just had to choose that one? What they did was incredibly cruel.

There is no calling \"dibs\" on a name. There was no point in them giving you notice they were using the name if you were just going to freak out, blow up their phone with texts screeching at them to change their minds, and recruiting family members to get them to change their minds.\n\nCameron is a *very common name*, for a girl or a boy.

When I was pregnant with my third baby, my husband and I agreed on two names, one for a boy and one for a girl. But when my newborn son was placed in my arms for the first time, I just knew the name wasn\u2019t the right one for him even though it was one I\u2019d liked for years. My husband felt the same way. I suggested a name that popped into my mind, one we\u2019d never talked about before and my husband instantly agreed. It was the right name for our son and we had no second thoughts. Funnily enough, years later our son became very good friends with a nice boy who had the name we decided wasn\u2019t the right one. \n\nSo, maybe hold onto the thought that, as much as you liked the name Cameron, it might not have suited the baby you lost. I hope that might help you come to some sort of peace about it. Should you decide to have another child, when you get pregnant again, open your heart to new possibilities. \ud83c\udf08\u2764\ufe0f \n\nA word of advice: don\u2019t share baby names in advance. That doesn\u2019t have to be between anyone but you and your husband. \n\nAnother thing, someone mentioned this already but I wanted to echo it. It\u2019s very handy when your children have different initials. My three all had different initials, it wasn\u2019t a planned thing. It made it so much easier when plotting out our family schedule with appointments, soccer, baseball, piano, dance, etc etc. Friends who went with naming their 4 girls all \u201cJ\u201d names didn\u2019t have that same kind of convenience.

Your point might work better if this was like a year later or something, but they were pregnant at the same time.", "Like she admits, it\u2019s a hard situation and it\u2019s most likely coupled with her feelings about not having her baby when the SIL has. It will probably take a while to get through those emotions and i hope OP does. It\u2019s good of you to take responsibility for the less nice part of your comment. It\u2019s very mature, thank you:)", "Every time she hears that name, she will be reminded of her lost child. That will never go away. SIL would know this if she had the brains God gave a flea. What SIL did was cruel and nasty. If you can't understand that, you have my sympathy.", "also not refusing. we haven\u2019t met the baby because again, we\u2019re all taking a break. \n\nthey most certainly did remember. my SIL knew for years. she didn\u2019t suddenly forget.", "For OP it is a constant reminder of the child they lost. That is heartbreaking. SIL knew about OP\u2019s plan to use the name and intentionally hid it from her until the baby was born.", "Yeah it\u2019s definitely gonna not rub the right way seeing their kid named that and probably not named their kid that if what happened didn\u2019t happen, but I don\u2019t see them naming their kid a pretty common name as a bad thing. You can\u2019t expect someone to hold the same value as you do to your trauma, like I said before she doesn\u2019t own the name so they did not bring wrong by not telling her, cause they don\u2019t have to, or picking that name all together because again they don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s not fair to be mad at them for something like a name just because of what happened to OP and it would be wrong to say they are AH in their decision even with what happened to OP", "That is not the SIL fault, OP must learn to let that hate in her heart go cause that\u2019s not cruel or nasty IMO.", "You assume she remembered. You don\u2019t own a name.", "This is probably going to be a pretty bad comparison but you seem young so I think this might help you make some sense of it.\n\nImagine you have a crush on someone, your best friend tells you they\u2019re not that impressed by that person. But you still feel otherwise so you put in some effort. You start talking to this person more, you find things in common such as  movies and food that you both like, and you just can\u2019t get over how lucky you are this person likes you back.Then one day that person randomly stops talking to you, just full on ghosts you, pretty much blocks you on everything. The next time you see this person, they\u2019re dating your best friend who only expressed disinterest.\n\nAre you happy each time you see them or are you pissed? \n\nNow imagine that, but with life and death involved", "it\u2019s very easy to assume she remembered when her response to my mom telling her i was upset was \u201cwell they didn\u2019t use it\u201d", "You sound like you\u2019re projecting. If OP hadn\u2019t had a miscarriage, the situation would\u2019ve been different. But she just lost the child she was going to name Cameron and who would\u2019ve been born four days before SIL\u2019s. SIL would\u2019ve had to pick a different name then too, maybe she would\u2019ve given the name Cameron still, but in that case no major life altering loss would\u2019ve occurred.", "This is gonna sound really edgy but nah I wouldn\u2019t really care tbh. If crush sees something in best friend and wants to pursue something with them instead of me that\u2019s just life at the end of the day and they are free to do that if it\u2019s what they want for them.\n\nNot saying that what happened to OP doesn\u2019t suck cause it does but SIL isn\u2019t a villain for naming her kid what she did, however OP can still want to keep her distance if it bothers her and she\u2019s not an AH for wanting that cause it\u2019s her decision.\n\nTLDR there are no assholes here but to hold negative feelings for SIL is kinda weird since she did nothing wrong IMO", "Which could have been the answer whether or not she remembered\u2026 Being informed you were going to use it, even if she didn\u2019t remember would have the same response\u2026 It also doesn\u2019t change the fact that if you get pregnant again, you can still use it.", "Not projecting, responding. That\u2019s really irrelevant. It\u2019s sad for her, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that she doesn\u2019t own the name. The SIL may not have picked a different name, she may very well still have used the name she loved, and it would be no different than this situation. If SIL hadn\u2019t used Cameron I\u2019m sure OP would have next pregnancy, which completely counters the idea that it belonged to the lost pregnancy.", "Ok\n\nIf you think hiding the name of your child from everyone including your family until it\u2019s born because you know that every time your sister calls that child\u2019s name until one of them dies, it will remind her of her child that died who should be growing up along your child isn\u2019t a dick move, that\u2019s on you."]}
