I think most westerners will say, \u201cNTA it\u2019s your life\u201d while people raised in the same traditions as your parents will likely disagree. \n\nNTA from this American, but I have no idea what consequences your decision will have on your life.", "As a westerner I'd say NTA, but you're fighting hundreds of years of cultural tradition where the parents decide who their kid marries.    I don't know what reprecussions you'd face if you bulk cultural tradition.      Do you want family relationships going forward?  Would they cut you off?   Would your parents face anything if you buck tradition?   I know it's your lilfe and happiness but there's more to consider here.  Choose wisely for you.", "NTA.  \n\nLook - I might be... reading too much into this.  But I'm just going to toss this out.\n\nOftentimes - people \"protect\" certain elements of their culture - thinking it will protect certain other elements down the line.\n\nFor example - it sounds like in your culture, arranged marriages are common.  Well, aren't some other common facets like - sending a lot of money back home to your family?  Helping to support your family as they get older?  Etc?\n\nMy point here is:  it's possible part of their motiviations for pushing to into an arranged marriage, would also be to try and lock down future money/help from you.  And if you marry someone, that they pick, in the same culture - it's more likely you'll succumb to future pressure to send most of your money back to your family.\n\nNow, maybe that's not your family - maybe they are rich.  But I'd absolutely be worried that's the next step in this.", "NTA do what's best for you. I worked with an Indian woman for many years, she and her husband were an arranged marriage and they seem to genuinely care for each other. I know not all of them turn out that way though and that's why you aren't an asshole for wanting to decide yourself.", "NTA. \n\n>she went on a rant that I am selfish to think like this and I have no respect for my parents.\n\nLike they do for you?", "I understand that your parents are from India and that arranged marriages are the norm there, but they don\u2019t have any say in when and who you should marry.\n\nNTA, it\u2019s your decision of when and who you want to marry, the parents can\u2019t make that decision for you", "You are NTA. This kind of thing is complicated though. I wouldn't even necessarily say that your parents are AHs. They are a product of their time and tradition. They have a perspective rooted in cultural and societal values and expectations. \n\nIf you can, talk to them. Ask them why they are insisting. Ask them what they are looking for. If their opinions matter to you, show them that you are listening. Don't get me wrong, you should definitely hold your ground as well. If you show that you are listening, they might do the same. \n\nAs a second generation immigrant I feel this and have done the same with my folks. It's exhausting, but I have been lucky that they have listened. When it comes down to it, they can never actually force you to do anything.", "NTA - You have been Westernized against  your country's tradition where the parents think they own you and can dictate things like that to you.  Stand firm (watch out for kidnapping) and go where you heart leads you.  Your parents can go suck on a Elephant Ear fig however.", "NTA. \nBut you\u2019re challenging their expectations and beliefs - I bet your mum has already got someone in mind for you\u2026 They\u2019re not going to change their minds easily, but perhaps if you find a \u2018nice Indian girl\u2019 they will approve of her and that might be a compromise?\n(I don\u2019t agree with them for clarity!! \ud83d\ude02)", "NTA. Its your life and your right, your are not a child any more. The thins is just a bs fantasy they have. Even if they suggest the partner, Its still your choice. They have no power here, so maybe don't get so worked up? Its not like they are or would reject your fiance.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Indian culture is insufferable for more independent-minded people.", "I grew up in a community where semi-arranged marriages are standard. Your parents don\u2019t exactly choose who you will marry, but dating is a formal affair of considering whether or not you will marry (while strictly not touching each other or spending any time alone together) and all potential dates are vetted before you meet.\n\nI opted out of that, and out of the religion altogether. I think who you marry is a personal decision. But there are consequences. I know of people whose parents have cut them off. My parents did not but it was still a BIG DEAL."]}
