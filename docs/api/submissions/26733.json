I think most westerners will say, \u201cNTA it\u2019s your life\u201d while people raised in the same traditions as your parents will likely disagree. \n\nNTA from this American, but I have no idea what consequences your decision will have on your life.", "As a westerner I'd say NTA, but you're fighting hundreds of years of cultural tradition where the parents decide who their kid marries.    I don't know what reprecussions you'd face if you bulk cultural tradition.      Do you want family relationships going forward?  Would they cut you off?   Would your parents face anything if you buck tradition?   I know it's your lilfe and happiness but there's more to consider here.  Choose wisely for you.", "NTA.  \n\nLook - I might be... reading too much into this.  But I'm just going to toss this out.\n\nOftentimes - people \"protect\" certain elements of their culture - thinking it will protect certain other elements down the line.\n\nFor example - it sounds like in your culture, arranged marriages are common.  Well, aren't some other common facets like - sending a lot of money back home to your family?  Helping to support your family as they get older?  Etc?\n\nMy point here is:  it's possible part of their motiviations for pushing to into an arranged marriage, would also be to try and lock down future money/help from you.  And if you marry someone, that they pick, in the same culture - it's more likely you'll succumb to future pressure to send most of your money back to your family.\n\nNow, maybe that's not your family - maybe they are rich.  But I'd absolutely be worried that's the next step in this.", "NTA do what's best for you. I worked with an Indian woman for many years, she and her husband were an arranged marriage and they seem to genuinely care for each other. I know not all of them turn out that way though and that's why you aren't an asshole for wanting to decide yourself.", "NTA. \n\n>she went on a rant that I am selfish to think like this and I have no respect for my parents.\n\nLike they do for you?", "I understand that your parents are from India and that arranged marriages are the norm there, but they don\u2019t have any say in when and who you should marry.\n\nNTA, it\u2019s your decision of when and who you want to marry, the parents can\u2019t make that decision for you", "You are NTA. This kind of thing is complicated though. I wouldn't even necessarily say that your parents are AHs. They are a product of their time and tradition. They have a perspective rooted in cultural and societal values and expectations. \n\nIf you can, talk to them. Ask them why they are insisting. Ask them what they are looking for. If their opinions matter to you, show them that you are listening. Don't get me wrong, you should definitely hold your ground as well. If you show that you are listening, they might do the same. \n\nAs a second generation immigrant I feel this and have done the same with my folks. It's exhausting, but I have been lucky that they have listened. When it comes down to it, they can never actually force you to do anything.", "NTA - You have been Westernized against  your country's tradition where the parents think they own you and can dictate things like that to you.  Stand firm (watch out for kidnapping) and go where you heart leads you.  Your parents can go suck on a Elephant Ear fig however.", "NTA. \nBut you\u2019re challenging their expectations and beliefs - I bet your mum has already got someone in mind for you\u2026 They\u2019re not going to change their minds easily, but perhaps if you find a \u2018nice Indian girl\u2019 they will approve of her and that might be a compromise?\n(I don\u2019t agree with them for clarity!! \ud83d\ude02)", "NTA. Its your life and your right, your are not a child any more. The thins is just a bs fantasy they have. Even if they suggest the partner, Its still your choice. They have no power here, so maybe don't get so worked up? Its not like they are or would reject your fiance.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Lots of young Indians decide when they will marry (or not) and who they will marry. Just keep talking to your parents about this and don't succumb to their emotional blackmail.", "NTA. Not all traditions should last forever. Like fox hunting and bear baiting.", "NTA.  You\u2019re the one who has to live with the consequences of the choice, so it should be yours to make.", "NTA \n\nLook I know exactly what you are going through now. But don\u2019t change your stance over this. They are not going to change and you cannot even try to change them. \n\nLook if you are strong enough to ignore them please do that. Listen from one ear throw out the other. I don\u2019t understand this logic you can date whoever you want but you should marry a girl of their choice. At the end of the day they cannot force you.", "NTA but may want to move out and put that ocean back between you and your family. Indian culture is insufferable for more independent-minded people.", "I grew up in a community where semi-arranged marriages are standard. Your parents don\u2019t exactly choose who you will marry, but dating is a formal affair of considering whether or not you will marry (while strictly not touching each other or spending any time alone together) and all potential dates are vetted before you meet.\n\nI opted out of that, and out of the religion altogether. I think who you marry is a personal decision. But there are consequences. I know of people whose parents have cut them off. My parents did not but it was still a BIG DEAL.", "NTA and I'd be wary of going back to India anytime soon because the next time you go there you could be greeted by the woman they've picked out for you.", "I found that the easiest way to deal with this when it came to my parents was to tell them that I would be open to anyone they wanted to introduce me to, but that at the end of the day, the decision will be mine. There's no way they decide what I am physically and mentally attracted to in a person. I have to sleep next to this person everyday, possibly have kids with them, and spend the rest of my life with them, not my parents. And that as my parents that have raised me, they should feel confident that they did a good job and i can pick a good life partner for myself. But again, if they want to introduce me to someone, that is fine. \n\n Your parents may mean well especially if they themselves got married in similar circumstances. However, life can be very long if you marry someone you do not want to. Do not let anyone, including your parents, pressure you into a marriage you do not want. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are NTA. You are an adult (I am assuming) that has the right to decide who you want to spend your life with.", "NTA. Indian here, People here think that they own every ounce of your life if they have given birth to you.\n Your parents' only concern is that your girlfriend is a foreigner and she won't be treated equally in the society (In short- Samaj kya sochega?). Or maybe she won't be able to understand your culture and religion. \nMy man! If you truly love that girl, let your parents meet her, let her family talk to your family. Discuss everything and have a bang wedding!", "The world has changed. Maybe these old traditions need to. Only you can decide this.", "NTA at all! Arranged marriages at disgusting and, even though not all the time, they are a sentence imposed upon women. By not adhering to this horrible tradition, you are saving yourself and some woman from a lifetime of potential unhappiness.", "I don't mean any offense but this is lunacy. All I can do is tell you how I'd react and thats with a big laugh followed by the most sincere F.U.", "Culture/traditions are NOT sacrosanct. People use \u201coh but culture/tradition\u201d to push a lot of horrible stuff. Break the cycle, it is never wrong to want to control your own life.", "Nta\n\nBut you should pay for your wedding yourself then.", "Of course NTA", "NTA. I get it's a cultural thing but culture is based on consent. You and your parents need to agree to continue the traditional route. And you clearly don't. Arranged marriages are very old and flawed. I get you may say it's a cultural thing but logically it doesn't make sense. Why would someone want to spend the rest of their lives with someone they didn't choose and might not even like?\nTry and explain this to your parents. If it doesn't work consider cutting them off.", "NTA. Your parents are from a different generation and have customs and traditions you're expected to follow. But you're an adult and don't have to do anything you don't want. I can't imagine anyone choosing my future life partner for me but you're going to have to be firm and be prepared for the wailing and gnashing of teeth about your decision.", "They should decide that you should marry your girlfriend. Win-win!", "This is either a no assholes or they're the asshole situation depending on one's take on the Indian culture of arranged marriages and hierarchical society.\n\nMy take is... Go West life is peaceful there... so they're the assholes for not understanding the life of freedom and romance and especially failing to respect your wishes regarding your life.", "NTA.  If this is not something you would do to your child, why would you let your parents do it to you? This cultural bullying has to stop somewhere.  Why not with you?  \n\nIf you had asked your parents to arrange a marriage,  that would be different, since that would be your wish as well.", "FWIW, I used to babysit for an Indian couple that moved to the US because they married against their parents' wishes as they were differing social ranks, but met in uni. It was the only way they could be together.\n\nAs you already live in the UK (and intend to stay there?), I don't think it will be as much of an issue. What might be an issue is your parents' expectations of care as they age as in many parts of Asia, elder care falls on the children, while in Western countries, it is a more nuanced approach that each family faces individually.\n\nAt the end of the day, you know what your parents expect, but you do not have to give in to their expectations. You can even block their access to you.", "NTA. Your culture is the cause of your discomfort. You either have to embrace or become comfortable with having your parents being disappoint in you.\n\nProbably isn't a middle ground.\n\nMake your decision as soon as you can as the pressure from them will not lesson.", "Nta", "OP. NTA. However your parents are parroting hundreds of years of culture and strong social expectations. I rejected arranged marriages after a lot of pressure and it was very hard. However decide and then don\u2019t give in. Emotional manipulation is to be expected unfortunately in our culture.\n\nIf you feel guilt then be prepared to go through with an arranged marriage. Unfortunately you cannot have one foot on both sides.", "NTA go no contact with them.", ">I\u2019m in UK and my parents are in India.\n\nWhere are you again? Because you don't have to do anything they say. They're going treat you horribly over it but you can hang up phones.", "NTA. The only assholes in the situation are your parents trying to force their badly outdated ideas onto you, and the moral relativists here defending that reprehensible aspect of the culture you were raised in.", "NTA, but it sounds like it's more of a cultural expectation. Unfortunately, it means you have to be prepared mentally to either defend your convictions and deal with your parent's reprimands or give in and betray your desires and have the emotional and mental consequences; you are between a rock and a hard place.", "Eh, they'll come around. Love marriages are so common now - more of their friends' kids probably have love marriages than not. They'll push back as much as they can, but once you actually marry the person of your choice, they will deal just fine."]}
