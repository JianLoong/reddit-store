You have good values buddy.", "NTA. \n\nBirthday or not, your sister was not right.

What sort of standards is she expecting?", "Why does she get to be pulled aside when she was an absolutely raving ass to her parents in front of everyone?", "If the sister is publicly dissing the cake then she deserves to be publicly dressed down for it.", "I feel OP's parents have created an entitled little monster who wouldn't know how to make a cake, let alone attempt to decorate it to her own standards. I'm sure she was expecting some kind of quasi-wedding cake which is very trendy on Instagram. \n\nI'm imagining the shocked-Pikachu expression on her face for her eighteenth when she gets absolutely nothing and is told if she wants a cake, she needs to arrange it herself.", "Exactly. She drew attention to the cake in an extremely ungrateful way, very publicly. Let her be called out publicly."]}
