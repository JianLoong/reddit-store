Your sister should be more grateful, but it\u2019s not your place to tell your sister off.", "NTA, and now I\u2019m imagining the sister going out drinking for her 18th (legal age for it here, idk where OP is) and telling the bartender that the cocktail she ordered isn\u2019t up to her standards either. Has she actually TRIED decorating a cake herself? What sort of standards is she expecting?", "Why does she get to be pulled aside when she was an absolutely raving ass to her parents in front of everyone?", "If the sister is publicly dissing the cake then she deserves to be publicly dressed down for it.", "I feel OP's parents have created an entitled little monster who wouldn't know how to make a cake, let alone attempt to decorate it to her own standards. I'm sure she was expecting some kind of quasi-wedding cake which is very trendy on Instagram. \n\nI'm imagining the shocked-Pikachu expression on her face for her eighteenth when she gets absolutely nothing and is told if she wants a cake, she needs to arrange it herself.", "Exactly. She drew attention to the cake in an extremely ungrateful way, very publicly. Let her be called out publicly.", "I had a low key wedding in a park and then took my 12 guests out to dinner.\n\nWasn\u2019t planning on having a cake but my MIL surprised me with a strawberry cake with whip cream frosting. \n\nI literally hate whip cream and I hate fresh strawberry cake. The seeds, it gets wet, etc. would have much rather had chocolate or lemon or plain ass vanilla! \n\nI smiled and ate it. \n\nNTA", "NTA. It is cake.

NTA", "ESH That was rude of her, yes. But maybe she wanted to plan her birthday party and had a cake in mind. NOBODY likes surprise parties!!!!!!!!! So ESH for the stupid surprise party. Imagine she had been hoping for a small party with just a few friends going to a theme park or something. Instead she gets a large flower party with a theme she didn't pick, no fun activity, and a cake she does not like and would never have picked for herself.... possibly the cake is just the straw that broke the camels back and she had been grimacing about the hell that is a surprise party the entire time", "NTA, literally what the hell", "I honestly want to know what her friends thought of all this, because I can tell you that if I witnessed somebody acting like that at her age when *I* was that age, I'd have a *very* negative opinion of that behavior.\n\nLike, I'll be the first to say we should cut young people a little bit of slack for being immature, because it comes with the territory - but there's immature and then there's *this*.\n\nNTA.", "WOW. Just wow. I read that title and was so prepared for a Y T A because what a crappy thing to say to someone on their literal birthday. But then I read the post\u2026 yeah no, that was so deserved. What an actual brat.\n\n I pretty much always want one specific type of cake (special family recipe) for my bday, and the few times my parents deviated from that, I was annoyed on the inside. But I ate it and enjoyed it (cake is cake, it\u2019s all pretty good honestly) and then next year would specifically mention the type of cake I wanted.

Come next year when it's a milestone 18th birthday, the parents should do nothing.", "My aunt got me a birthday one time. She made big promises that it would be like a Cake Boss cake. I wanted a vampire theme cake. It ended up being a cat with a bat printed on it. It wasn\u2019t a cute bat. It was a realistic bat.

I did ask for a vampire bat but not like that.", "Parents don't always \"create the entitled little monster.\" Sometimes the kids are just hardwired that way. They're either born thinking the world owes them or they turn a certain age, like 18 and suddenly think they know everything and they deserve only the best.", "I have no idea what you wanted it to be like. That is a bat. How else would a bat look?", "That's true. I think social media is actually the primary cause of so much goddamn entitlement.
