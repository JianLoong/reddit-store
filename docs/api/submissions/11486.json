I wonder if this is permissible for me to express myself here in hopes of adding some of my perspective. My mother is 79. My son is 15 months old. Of his 4 grandparents, two are gone and one is demented. Only my mom remains as his chance to have fulfilling memories of a grandmother who loves him and is interested in him. She was not a perfect mother. She divorced my father and at times exposed me to her blunt negative opinions on my own father. But she did expose me to wonderful grandparents and she gave me more than my share of confidence and love. I am a successful surgeon with an accomplished career, and friends all over the world. You have to see my wife, the OP, to believe how funny and beautiful this woman is. These are things a guy has difficulty achieving without a loving and nurturing mother, so you might guess correctly that she filled me with confidence as a child. Now it is true that she has not handled adult relationships with her other grandchildren well. She is too blunt and could be accused of splitting behavior as seen in certain personality disorders. But this current debate is about her saying goo goo ga ga to a toddler.\nMy wife (OP) correctly disclosed that my mother is more interested in playing with the toddler than the 2 month old, but honestly I think any of you who find this unusual are kind of weird yourselves for reading something negative into this. The toddler is strong, walks, babbles, and is very social. So boom. OP fooled you if you find that a red flag.\nNow, I read that I'm being attacked in some corners for being insensitive and perhaps weaponizing the adoption issue. Is there nobody here who would defend me in asserting that a child's relationship with a biological grandmother (however flawed in fully understanding which foods contain allergens) who raised the child's father is a resource to be valued or even cherished?

Unless she has healed her wounds she WILL hurt your child.", "NTA\n\nYour instincts are on high alert for a reason, don\u2019t ignore them or go against them.\n\nQuestion: why doesn\u2019t husband believe BIL or nieces and nephews when they say she was abusive?", "NTA... Trust your mothers instincts. The baby can not tell you what happened.", "You should cross post this to r/JUSTNOMIL  There are too many similar stories like this and you can find a lot of support and information.", "NTA. Trust yourself. You know she has fed him allergens. Your neiblings say she is abusive and not safe around kids. Your husband is wrong, wrong, wrong. Keep your baby away from her.", "NTA I am asking why she wants to be alone with him. That in it's self raises flags to me. You don't give people a chance with humans that can't tell you what is happening. The fact that she has no interest in your daughter says alot also.  Tell your husband that this is a hill you are willing to die on.  This isn't only your gut instinct talking, you have had others and even your husband tell you she is abusive and should never be left alone with children. Always, always trust your gut. It is almost always right.", "NTA - just draw the line for the sake of your son. Whatever is wrong with MIL does not need to be proven by letting her hurt your child first.\n\nYour husband needs to figure this out and if he needs to do that outside the family home then \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f because son must be protected here", "NTA\n\nShe sounds dangerous.  Feeding him known allergens?  That can be deadly.", "NTA, it's time to respectfully put your foot down. If mil doesn't respond well, then screw doing it respectfully.", "Your MIL is trying to use your son as a vessel for the demon king Paimon.  Definitely NTA.", ">Now, the problem lies with my husband who constantly talks about how she wasn\u2019t a good mother, but he thinks we should \u201cgive her a chance because that\u2019s what biological family does\u201d\n\nYou are adopted and he says that to you?\n\n>Husband says, it was for religious reasons, but my nieces, nephews, and brother-in-law say that it was because she was an abusive person who can\u2019t be trusted alone with children.\n\nTell them to tell that to your husband and then tell him his mother is banned from your house, your son is never to be alone with her and he needs to go to therapy because his mother already tried to harm your child by feeding him allergens. \n\nThere is something wrong with your husband's thought process. You don't go oh she was a bad mom but I will give her endless chances to mess with my kid. Get a diary and write down everything she has done and an approximate time. NTA.", "Anyone else worrying about how the SIL died? Possibly MIL revenge for being kept away from her grandkids? /s \ud83d\ude02", "I remember that story. It was so heartbreaking!", "Do you really think it\u2019s okay that your wife needs to sneak off to feed your son safely? If you want your mom to have a healthy relationship with your son, then you need to be willing to address her bad behavior and set boundaries. Also, you mom does not need to be alone with your son to have a relationship and form memories with your son. \n\nIf your mom is not able to correctly identify and feed your child food that is safe for him, then she is not a safe person to leave with him unsupervised. \n\nShe could be the nicest, most wonderful person in the world, and it wouldn\u2019t matter because she is putting his health at risk."]}
