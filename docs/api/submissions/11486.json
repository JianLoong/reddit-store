She has been saying stuff like this since he was born, but doesn\u2019t ask the same about his 2 month old sister. In fact she never asks for pictures or updates on the baby. When she calls it\u2019s always put 1year old son on the phone I just want to talk to him. Whenever she comes to visit she doesn\u2019t let him nap. She refuses to let anyone but her feed him or change his diaper.  Then when he inevitably cries, because she can\u2019t figure out how to feed him, she gets angry at me for somehow causing him to cry. She has also fed him his allergens refusing to believe that he\u2019s allergic to anything. This has made it so whenever she\u2019s around I have to sneak off and feed him somewhere.\n\nNow, the problem lies with my husband who constantly talks about how she wasn\u2019t a good mother, but he thinks we should \u201cgive her a chance because that\u2019s what biological family does\u201d and \u201cI lived at your mothers house for three months.

He also lived with his father after middle school while his sister lived with his mother.) \n\nFor further context my now deceased sister-in-law did not allow her children to be left alone with her mother. Husband says, it was for religious reasons, but my nieces, nephews, and brother-in-law say that it was because she was an abusive person who can\u2019t be trusted alone with children.\n\nSo am I the Asshole for not leaving my son alone with my mother in law?", "created_utc": 1677964341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11idekj/aita_for_not_feeling_safe_leaving_my_son_alone/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wonder if this is permissible for me to express myself here in hopes of adding some of my perspective. My mother is 79. My son is 15 months old. Of his 4 grandparents, two are gone and one is demented. Only my mom remains as his chance to have fulfilling memories of a grandmother who loves him and is interested in him. She was not a perfect mother. She divorced my father and at times exposed me to her blunt negative opinions on my own father. But she did expose me to wonderful grandparents and she gave me more than my share of confidence and love. I am a successful surgeon with an accomplished career, and friends all over the world. You have to see my wife, the OP, to believe how funny and beautiful this woman is. These are things a guy has difficulty achieving without a loving and nurturing mother, so you might guess correctly that she filled me with confidence as a child. Now it is true that she has not handled adult relationships with her other grandchildren well. She is too blunt and could be accused of splitting behavior as seen in certain personality disorders.
