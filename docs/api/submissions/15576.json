It seems ridiculous that I should go out of my way to close the blinds or take my closed to the half bath, which is the only room in the entire house that wouldn\u2019t be exposed. If there workers weren\u2019t there, nobody would be able to see inside my house. I own my apartment.\n\nThe work is scheduled to go on for another year.

Just because you don\u2019t care if strangers see you naked doesn\u2019t mean they want to see that.", "INFO: Is there a reason you couldn't close the blinds while you get dressed and then open them once you are? It does seem a bit much to request them be closed basically all day, but what's the harm is not exposing yourself to others and then opening them?", "YTA \n\nMy answer would be the same regardless of gender, don\u2019t non consensually expose yourself to workers.\n\nIs it frustrating that you feel limited in your home, sure, but the work is necessary and you just have to deal with that for the duration.\n\nShut your blinds when you\u2019re changing", "YTA - forcing the workers to see naked residents is creating a hostile work environment for the workers. The building is obligated to keep the worker's environment PG rated.", "Hard YTA, these comments are way too soft for my taste. \n\nShow these workers a little damn respect. They are WORKING, and the work they are doing directly benefits you. They should not have to be subjected to your naked body while they work. Your entitlement here is gross. Let\u2019s do some gender reversal here. \n\nPretend you\u2019re a man, and instead of construction workers, we\u2019re talking a female cleaning crew (gender stereotypes aside). \u201cAITAH for exposing my dick in front of my maids? They complained that it made them uncomfortable but it\u2019s my own house!\u201d This type of attitude is DEHUMANIZING to the people that are actively working to help you!\n\nIt would take you 2 seconds to shut your blinds while you change. Stop being disrespectful.", "YTA - you know the workers are there. If you don't want the blinds closed all day, so be it. Close them just to get dressed or step into a private room. No one is consenting to seeing you naked because you're too lazy to close the blinds for 2 minutes.", "YTA\n\nI cannot believe that this has to be said, but knowingly exposing your genitalia to someone who has not consented to see it *is not ok*. \n\nAt the absolute bare minimum, put on your underwear in the bathroom before dressing.", "YTA. All you have to do is close your blinds when you change, they're not asking much.", "YTA. What is this ridiculous line \u201cif there (wrong spelling btw) weren\u2019t there, nobody would be able to see inside my house\u201d.  Well duh, the whole point is there are workers.  How long does it take for you to get changed? Why are you acting like it\u2019s either have the blinds drawn all day as opposed to just closing your blinds when you get changed?", "YTA\n\nYou can close your blinds for those times you are naked and keep them open while you are working during the day.\n\nFrankly you sound like a petulant child. The work needs to be done. It will not last forever. Yes it's an imposition not to be able to behave freely in your home but you're an adult and should be able to make reasonable compromises.", "If the roles were reversed we would be on the guy for being a creeper.", "I mean yeah YTA. \n\nClosing the blinds for 5 minutes here and there while you\u2019re naked isn\u2019t a big deal. It\u2019s just common courtesy and respect for the people doing work on your building.", "Yta you don't have to have the blinds down all day, just the 10 minutes of you getting dressed.", "YTA.\n\nClose your blinds.", "YTA. Shut your effing blinds or change in another room. This is sexual harrassment.", "YTA - \n\nWhy are you so comfortable with strangers seeing you get dressed?\n\nThe rule is genuinely for safety concerns. For starters, knowingly being nude around people that did not consent to seeing you is sexual harassment. Especially considering they've now complained, if you keep doing this, they have a case. The rule also protects the workers from peeping tom accusations. Secondly, these workers are strangers. You have no idea how they'll react to seeing you. This time they complained. In a perfect world, another person should be respectful and not insane; you should be able to change in front of people without one of them deciding to stalk you. We do not, unfortunately, live in a perfect world.\n\nIt takes seconds to close your blinds before you change. For your safety and the comfort of the workers, close your damn blinds.", "I mean, yes, YTA. Just put up cling privacy film on the affected windows so you can still have light (and a view, depending on the film) and go through your daily routine without exposing yourself to the workers. Or, even simpler, change in the bathroom. It's really not that much of difficulty. \n\nI promise, they also don't want to be dealing with any of this BS. Very weird hill to die on.", "YTA for committing sexual harassment. No one wants to see you naked. Seems to me like you just seeking attention. You don't need to always have your blinds closed, but at least have the human decency to respect other people. YTA", "YTA. We live in a society. You don't get to just do whatever. It sucks but thats where we are. \n\n These workers are just doing a job that your building is asking them to do. You own your apartment, ergo \"your building\" means you aswell. You have asked them to do this work. It is an AH thing to subject workers to your nudity/borderline sexual assualt. No different than flashing the pizza delivery person. They are working, you've asked them to do the work, respect them. \n\n> If there workers weren\u2019t there,\n\nBut they are. Treat them with respect by not flashing them.", "YTA and this is SUCH a weird hill to die on. You have so many people here, and your husband, telling you why you are in the wrong and you just keep doubling down. Just because you don\u2019t care if other people see you naked doesn\u2019t mean anyone wants to see you naked. You can say you weren\u2019t doing anything sexual all you want, but exposing non consenting people to your nude body is sexual harassment. Regardless of gender and my own sexuality, I do not want to see naked people in places I\u2019d not expect to (like at my job? Where the clientele was told \u201cthere\u2019s gonna be some people on scaffolding working on the building! Please close your blinds if you\u2019re doing anything private!\u201d I would expect that anyone getting naked would be closing their blinds.)", "YTA. You\u2019re also an exhibitionist. You can\u2019t close the blinds for the five minutes it takes to change your clothes? You also admit to having a space where you could change in privacy but choose not to use it. Clearly the AH.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to close your blinds all day - just close them when you are dressing or dress in the bathroom. That\u2019s 5 minutes a day maybe? Or dress before they get started for the day. Have some respect and consideration for people trying to do their jobs without seeing you naked.", " YTA what the hell is wrong with you? Genuinely, you are exposing yourself to non consenting people who are trying to do their jobs.", "People are being way too nice to you IMO. Like this is literally sexual harassment. People are trying to just do their job and you refuse to change in an area where they won't be forced to see you naked... MMM WTF?   \n\n\n YTA... How is this even a question?  How is it ridiculous to clothes your blinds when you change? You're blowing my mind honestly because this is like the most common thing to do. I live in a house, and whenever myself or my partner changes/ gets naked we always close our blinds... Because even just from the side walk people can usually see into a two storey home pretty easily. I've learned this the hard way from literally just walking my dog and seeing things I really wish I haven't from literally just looking up. So if they're working on your floor I can only imagine how uncomfortable that must be for those poor people.   \n\n\nClosing your blinds takes two seconds, it doesn't have anything to do with \"changing your schedule\". And it's something that people with any type of decency do basically everyday. Frankly, it sounds like you want them to see you naked. Because this is the most insane thing I've ever heard.", "They are doing maintenance on property that you own.  They are preserving or increasing your property value.   Show them a little respect.", "Of course yta.", "I don't really understand the problem. You could easily close the drapes in 30 seconds, or go into the half-bath that you state outright doesn't have windows.\n\nThis is not a big deal, at all. I get that it's your property. Your property needs maintenance and upkeep, which will preserve the value of your property and probably prevent repairs from becoming more expensive later on.\n\nYTA.", "Hey, check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!\n\nOh yeah! Oh my god! That is our friend! It\u2019s naked Ross!", "YTA and I am sure your bathroom is a closed room.", "YTA. You know YTA. Not only are you exposing yourself to people who don\u2019t want to see it and haven\u2019t consented, you purposefully made up a fake account to avoid your husband finding out that you are flashing the construction workers.\n\nLet\u2019s be real here, sounds like this lady is hoping one of these workers stops by to say \u201chi\u201d while her husband is gone.", "YTA.Rulea are rules. I'm sure you would also be quick enough to complain if they were outside your window perving on you whilst you were getting changed. I wonder if you maybe are a bit of a voyeur and are enjoying the possible thrill of strange men seeing you naked? It's the only logical reason for why you wouldn't shut the blinds for the time it takes you to get dressed..", "YTA. Don\u2019t change in front of open/non blocked windows.", "Im going with soft YTA. I get your point but when you buy an apartment and not single house, aren't you signed up to be involved in the shared parts of building? Whats so hard about just leaving one room's curtain down and change in that room. The worker is just there and you are also just there, i cant blame the worker for not wanting to see naked ppl.", "YTA - I can understand why you\u2019re frustrated, but it\u2019s extremely normal to keep your curtains closed while getting dressed/walking around unclothed! Pretty much anyone who lives in a suburban home does this on a daily basis, to prevent their neighbours seeing them nude. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s asking too much to just pull the blinds down for the brief time it takes you to change.", "YTA The workers have a right to do their jobs without fear of having to see naked people. Would it be ok if you worked in an office and had to see strange men's private parts? For the next year, your building is their workplace. It is not unreasonable for you to take less than 30 seconds to close your bedroom window blinds while you're getting dressed and then open them back up. I agree the building is asking too much by wanting you to have all your blinds closed all day. But you are being rude and a creeper by purposefully exposing yourself to workers just trying to do their jobs.", "YTA I don\u2019t care how attractive you think you are you should respect the workers who don\u2019t want to see you while in their workplace.

I agreed asking you have the blinds shut all day everyday for a year is excessive.

I live in a high rise with many other high rise buildings around me, and everyone can see into everyone else's windows. It's just a part of life in a dense situation like this that someone in another apartment might be naked. Guess what? You don't look. I routinely close my blinds for changing etc. Others don't. In the building opposite, a naked couple were building furniture with the blinds open. In the building beside, a guy swiffers in his underwear. You just don't look.

I mean if you were openly antagonizing them with your nakedness, then maybe that would be different, or if this was about children or something where they shouldn't see you, yeah, I would probably say it's inappropriate. Adults should accept that sometimes you'll just see something that you might not want to see, I mean I played water polo in high school, I saw many of my teammates genitalia, didn't want to, but that's what happens when you play a sport.

It's just f-d up honestly.", "I\u2019m really not trying to argue, I just don\u2019t think a lot of these commenters are actually reading the full post and the updates I\u2019m giving.", "Info: The worker was not directly outside my window. I was getting changed and as I was getting changed the platform that raises and lowers the workers went past my window.", "\n\u2022\t\u2060The building sucks for suggesting you were at all in the wrong for using your home in a way that is, 100%, a normal and reasonable use of the property.\n\n\nThe building management did a poor job of explaining why this rule is in place. Worker safety is highly implicated here. Imagine when you are driving and get a sudden bright set of headlights coming in your direction, and how that can hurt your eyes and cause you to look away. That is the exact same risk for the workers. \n\nTV and computer screens, lights coming on, for example. The person inside the unit is just living their life, yes, but a worker travelling fast outside, above ground, may have just had a crazy unexpected amount of sudden brightness that they could not prepare for. This should have been explained to residents.", "So when blinds are closed they must remain closed all day? What kind of blinds are these that can only transition once each day?\n\nOP can close the blinds, get changed, then miraculously can reopen the blinds. It's a modern miracle.", "For a year too. NTA.", "She's the AH but not for that reason. \n\nIf they were on a beach that allowed nudity she would not be the AH for allowing others to see her nude.\n\nCan't stand this kind of religious \"for her husband's eyes only\" stuff.", "The husband isn\u2019t mad because he feels disrespected, he said she should consider the comfort *of the workers*", "This commenter is TA. Her body is only for her husband? Get out of the Dark Ages. Her body is hers.", "Honestly, I just don\u2019t care. And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m sexualizing myself, I\u2019m literally just changing into my day time clothes from my morning workout clothes.", "She doesn't have to have everything shut tight for the entire day. She can just close the blinds while she's changing.", "Someone who 1) doesn\u2019t want to be accused of being a peeping Tom while working 2) someone who is working in a dangerous situation and doesn\u2019t want to potentially be caught off guard and hurt themselves from seeing someone naked. The fact that they said something means that it\u2019s a real concern. Have a little respect for the people who are risking their lives so that you can\nLive in your beautiful high rise apartment.", "I\u2019m genuinely confused. Have none of these commenters been in a locker room?", "So you're too stubborn and self-absorbed to do someone else a simple courtesy. Got it.", "Ok, so if you don't really have a reason, wouldn't it stand that for the sake of potentially keeping the peace, you close the blinds while you get dressed and then open them once you are? Kinda seems like a no-brainer solution. You don't force anyone to see you naked and you still get to have your blinds open.", "so you need to sun your ass every day? Seriously close the blinds when you change. YTA.", "That was my thought, either this is a kink for her or she literally does not view these men as people worthy of the same level of respect as anyone else. Genuinely can\u2019t decide which one is worse.", "Breasts aren't genitalia, so neither would I?\n\nYou said you were naked. That would imply zero clothes and thus, exposed genitalia.", "Listen, I own my own place too. I actually own my own apartment, just like you.\n\nI close my curtains when I change. Because not only do my neighbors and building workers not consent to seeing my boobs and crotch, *I* don't want them to see them either.\n\nWould YOU want to have to see your neighbors naked any given time you stepped outside? Would YOU want to see a client naked while you were working outside their home? \n\nNobody should be forced to see someone naked. Especially when they're just doing their jobs. If you still want natural light but no peepers, get some of that cool frosted glass privacy film. \n\nListen: what you care about or do not care about is fine and dandy for you as an individual. The *moment* your actions affect others, though, what you do or don't care about does not matter. You may not care if someone sees you naked. *The person who sees you naked, though, should have a say*. \n\nThey've complained. They don't want to see it. Close your blinds. It's not that big a deal. It will be though, because as I said - it's sexual harassment. Just because you're a woman doesn't mean you can't do it. Imagine if the roles were switched here and you had a neighbor or client that refused to close his blinds when he changed and you kept seeing his dick all the time? It's creepy.", "Because there are workers who can see into them, and have complained about having to see your naked body while they do their jobs.", "Because strangers are passing through while the building is under maintenance?you know if you had a house instead of an apartment being naked in your own yard would be inconsiderate for the neighbours", "As others have said, I also own my home. I also LOVE natural light and keep all the curtains and both front and back doors open during the day. But I also live in a very pedestrian-heavy suburban neighborhood, so when I'm changing or dressing I close the curtains in my bedroom until I'm done. It's literally so simple.", "Because it's not just about your comfort. You aren't the only person that matters in this situation, and the other party has said that they don't consent to seeing you naked.", "How American. It\u2019s called common courtesy. What can you also flash passers by cuz it\u2019s your own property. Can you shoot in your backyard cuz it\u2019s your property. Be a decent human. YTA.", "If you owned a house and had workers inside working on something would you walk around naked?", "First time this happens, unhappy accident. Second time this happens, you are an asshole. Just close the binds, change, and open them again like a reasonable human.", "All your explanations just make you TA further. You are literally sexually harassing workers and claim it\u2019s because you can\u2019t be bothered to close blinds for few minutes each day! \n\nYou can throw any excuses you want, but YTA and I wish one of them will report and sue your naked entitled ass for sexual harassment!", "Not a religious view but a strong belief in monogamy. Did she ever say they run off to Mykonos to do nude sunbathing?  If she said that, I would not have made my remark. I think most couples do not go to those places nor would they consider such.", "Her body is hers, of course; her husband has a right to his boundaries that he sets.  Perhaps, and we'll never know, he doesn't want to seem so controlling.  There is much we don't know in this context, nor will we ever know.  I can only offer thoughts how to think about this situation.  It's hers to accept or reject, and not for your or anyone else to do so for her.", "Okay but if you were a worker that had to do a job in someone's home, and a man living there kept changing his pants in front of you, would it make you uncomfortable?", "But THEY care, which is the point. \n\nThey were hired to do work on your building and deserve a comfortable work environment. If that means closing your blinds for 5 minutes to change, it\u2019s not that much to ask.", "They didn\u2019t consent to seeing you naked! Why is that so hard for you to grasp! You are literally sexually harassing these men and it\u2019s gross! They\u2019ve asked you to stop, just stop!\n\nETA: is this like a kink for you? You enjoy exposing yourself to people without their consent? Or do you just not respect these working class men enough to consider them human beings who deserve a workplace free of naked strangers? Because it has to be one of the two.", "THEY care. Not everyone wants to see other people naked, especially while at work. And even if they don\u2019t care they don\u2019t know that you don\u2019t care. What if you reported them for perving on you? They could get in trouble.", "THEY care. They don't want to have to see a naked stranger. Why can't you try and have a shred of freaking decency and let them just do their work? You literally need a few seconds to close your blinds.   \n\n\nAnd if these people went as far as to complain about your behaviour, they're clearly extremely uncomfortable. They deserve to work without feeling harassed.", "Most people don't hang out in the opposite gender's locker room, no. You spend a lot of time in the men's?", "In a locker room it's consensual. You choose to go in expecting to see that kind of thing. These workers don't expect to see you naked, and they shouldn't have to if it's making them uncomfortable.", "When you are in a locker room you are consenting to be in a space where you may see nudity. That is not the case when you are doing construction work.", "if you dont know what the difference between a locker room and flashing workers bc ur too lazy to close your curtains is ur genuinely a dumbass", "A locker room is consensual and everyone's in the same social position. \n\nMaintenance/construction workers are not in a position of equality with you. They aren't getting changed and it's not part of their job to see naked people; you are exerting social pressure on their ability to do their job. That's unfair of you, especially knowing that at least one of them has complained - that means it's no longer a case of passive lack of consent but an active denial of consent.\n\nThis isn't about you. Your judgement about whether they're being prudish is irrelevant. They're doing a necessary job for your building and they don't want to see naked people while they work - and that is a reasonable expectation to have of a workplace. Stop sexually harassing the workers.", "I\u2019m sorry, when you get changed are you spreading your legs such that being can see your vagina? I\u2019m talking about getting changed not filming a porno.", "The fact that she needs this spelled out for her\u2026i am truly baffled", "I\u2019m not American and don\u2019t live in America fwiw", "Of course not. And that\u2019s not an equivalent scenario by any means. I\u2019m briefly changing clothes in my bedroom, and construction workers sometimes pass by my window on their way to where they\u2019re working.", "You said:\n\n> Unless there is a medical issue, your naked body is for his eyes only, no?\n\nYou have made a blanket statement, not a comment specific to the original situation. So I'm replying in kind with a general trainee and a hypothetical example.\n\nAlso, monogamy does not mean that noone other than a spouse should see you naked. You have a rather prudish sense of what monogamy means but please be aware that this is not the universal definition of monogamy. Couples can be 100% monogamous without following your belief that the sight of their naked bodies is restricted only to their spouses.", "But they\u2019re not IN my home. They go past my home, outside, on a platform. When I go by peoples home I don\u2019t make a point of looking in and I frankly think it\u2019s on them not to peer in people\u2019s apartments who otherwise would have a fair bit of privacy if it wasn\u2019t for the ongoing work.", "They can look away. The moving platform went past the window.", "Or she thinks she\u2019s such hot shit they should be grateful for peek!", "It doesn't matter whether or not they're getting a gynecologist's viewpoint, they are still seeing you naked and they did not consent to that. \n\nYou don't have to have a dark apartment all day; just pull the blinds while you're getting dressed.", "You're being very weird about this. Either your vagina is covered or it's not. Put on your underwear in private and *then* do whatever you want.", "ur such a weirdo. its SEXUAL HARASSMENT to knowingly get nude when other people who do not consent to it are able to see you", "I dont get it just use the blinds for 3 minutes then put them back for that desired sunlight but its just too exhausting for her i guess and she dosent have to do this cuz ItS hEr HOme and people should just close their eyes when passing her apartment i guess", "That\u2019s your only defense for flashing strangers? Pathetic.", "> Why would I not be comfortable getting changed in my own home, especially property that I literally own?\n\nI was responding to this. Now we see that it being your own home isn\u2019t carte blanche to be naked regardless of the circumstances.", "So now you\u2019re blaming them for looking?? Wow\u2026the victim complex is strong with this one", "She's in her home! The workers can turn around for a minute if it offends them.", "I just want to know what she thinks people who DONT live in high rises do when they change. \u201cItS mY oWn HoMe\u201d like\u2026ma\u2019am. We all live \u201cin our own home(s)\u201d and none of us feel entitled to sexually harassing our neighbors over it.", "She could also close the blinds for a minute while she changes. If the workers turn around it's interrupting their work. If she closes the blinds for 2 seconds it's not interrupting anything.", "Turn around on a platform suspended in the air? So put themselves in further danger because she can\u2019t be considerate enough for 3 minutes?", "I didn't realize they let physically incapacitated people who can't turn their head 90 degrees to the side or look down to their feet on construction scaffolding."]}
