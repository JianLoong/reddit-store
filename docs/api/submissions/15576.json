I\u2019m not doing anything egregious or sexual, literally just changing my clothes.\n\nEDIT: The workers are NOT in my apartment. They go past my window periodically on a platform on their way to where the work is happening. They are also NOT sitting directly outside my apartment, it is always transitional.\n\nThrowaway because my husband (m40) is active on this sub.\n\nI (37f) live in a high rise building in a major city. For the past six months, the building has undergone a repair process in the exterior of my building and workers are regularly going up and down on platforms outside of our windows. Every room in our apartment is exposed to workers; we live on the 21st floor.\n\nThe building asked us to always have our blinds shut and windows closed while the workers are working, which is M-F from 8:30a to 5p. I work from home and it\u2019s absurd to my that for the majority of the day I have to have my blinds down, so I haven\u2019t really followed this rule. I really don\u2019t even see why it would be a rule - should be w suggestion.\n\nI recently got a note from the building saying that one of the workers complained because they saw me naked. It\u2019s true - I get dressed in the morning in my bedroom. I don\u2019t have a walk in closet so this is where it makes the most sense to get dressed. It seems ridiculous that I should go out of my way to close the blinds or take my closed to the half bath, which is the only room in the entire house that wouldn\u2019t be exposed. If there workers weren\u2019t there, nobody would be able to see inside my house. I own my apartment.\n\nThe work is scheduled to go on for another year. I told the building I would not be adjusting my routines inside an apartment I own. My husband told me I was being an asshole and that I should consider the comfort of the workers.

The building is obligated to keep the worker's environment PG rated.", "Hard YTA, these comments are way too soft for my taste. \n\nShow these workers a little damn respect. They are WORKING, and the work they are doing directly benefits you. They should not have to be subjected to your naked body while they work. Your entitlement here is gross. Let\u2019s do some gender reversal here. \n\nPretend you\u2019re a man, and instead of construction workers, we\u2019re talking a female cleaning crew (gender stereotypes aside). \u201cAITAH for exposing my dick in front of my maids?

Shut your effing blinds or change in another room. This is sexual harrassment.", "YTA - \n\nWhy are you so comfortable with strangers seeing you get dressed?\n\nThe rule is genuinely for safety concerns. For starters, knowingly being nude around people that did not consent to seeing you is sexual harassment. Especially considering they've now complained, if you keep doing this, they have a case. The rule also protects the workers from peeping tom accusations. Secondly, these workers are strangers. You have no idea how they'll react to seeing you. This time they complained. In a perfect world, another person should be respectful and not insane; you should be able to change in front of people without one of them deciding to stalk you. We do not, unfortunately, live in a perfect world.\n\nIt takes seconds to close your blinds before you change. For your safety and the comfort of the workers, close your damn blinds.", "I mean, yes, YTA. Just put up cling privacy film on the affected windows so you can still have light (and a view, depending on the film) and go through your daily routine without exposing yourself to the workers. Or, even simpler, change in the bathroom. It's really not that much of difficulty. \n\nI promise, they also don't want to be dealing with any of this BS. Very weird hill to die on.", "YTA for committing sexual harassment. No one wants to see you naked. Seems to me like you just seeking attention. You don't need to always have your blinds closed, but at least have the human decency to respect other people. YTA", "YTA. We live in a society. You don't get to just do whatever. It sucks but thats where we are. \n\n These workers are just doing a job that your building is asking them to do. You own your apartment, ergo \"your building\" means you aswell. You have asked them to do this work. It is an AH thing to subject workers to your nudity/borderline sexual assualt. No different than flashing the pizza delivery person. They are working, you've asked them to do the work, respect them. \n\n> If there workers weren\u2019t there,\n\nBut they are. Treat them with respect by not flashing them.", "YTA and this is SUCH a weird hill to die on. You have so many people here, and your husband, telling you why you are in the wrong and you just keep doubling down. Just because you don\u2019t care if other people see you naked doesn\u2019t mean anyone wants to see you naked. You can say you weren\u2019t doing anything sexual all you want, but exposing non consenting people to your nude body is sexual harassment. Regardless of gender and my own sexuality, I do not want to see naked people in places I\u2019d not expect to (like at my job? Where the clientele was told \u201cthere\u2019s gonna be some people on scaffolding working on the building! Please close your blinds if you\u2019re doing anything private!\u201d I would expect that anyone getting naked would be closing their blinds.)", "YTA. You\u2019re also an exhibitionist. You can\u2019t close the blinds for the five minutes it takes to change your clothes? You also admit to having a space where you could change in privacy but choose not to use it. Clearly the AH.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to close your blinds all day - just close them when you are dressing or dress in the bathroom. That\u2019s 5 minutes a day maybe? Or dress before they get started for the day. Have some respect and consideration for people trying to do their jobs without seeing you naked.", " YTA what the hell is wrong with you? Genuinely, you are exposing yourself to non consenting people who are trying to do their jobs.", "People are being way too nice to you IMO. Like this is literally sexual harassment. People are trying to just do their job and you refuse to change in an area where they won't be forced to see you naked... MMM WTF?   \n\n\n YTA... How is this even a question?  How is it ridiculous to clothes your blinds when you change? You're blowing my mind honestly because this is like the most common thing to do. I live in a house, and whenever myself or my partner changes/ gets naked we always close our blinds... Because even just from the side walk people can usually see into a two storey home pretty easily. I've learned this the hard way from literally just walking my dog and seeing things I really wish I haven't from literally just looking up. So if they're working on your floor I can only imagine how uncomfortable that must be for those poor people.   \n\n\nClosing your blinds takes two seconds, it doesn't have anything to do with \"changing your schedule\". And it's something that people with any type of decency do basically everyday. Frankly, it sounds like you want them to see you naked. Because this is the most insane thing I've ever heard.", "They are doing maintenance on property that you own.  They are preserving or increasing your property value.   Show them a little respect.", "Of course yta.", "I don't really understand the problem. You could easily close the drapes in 30 seconds, or go into the half-bath that you state outright doesn't have windows.\n\nThis is not a big deal, at all. I get that it's your property. Your property needs maintenance and upkeep, which will preserve the value of your property and probably prevent repairs from becoming more expensive later on.\n\nYTA.", "Hey, check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!\n\nOh yeah! Oh my god! That is our friend! It\u2019s naked Ross!", "YTA .  What stands out to me the  most, If there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.  Why are you hiding it from your husband???????  No big deal, so why not let him know as well.  He will find out about it.   Why use a throw away account?  I am sure the whole building will eventually know.\n\nI am sure your bathroom is a closed room or is the toilet out in open for you and your husband to watch each other?   Just admit you are an exhibitionist.  It is very sexist to think that because they are men they want to see you or ok with it.  I am glad to see even with the role reversal people think you are wrong.  Men/people do not want to be accused of peeping on you on purpose.  At least now the company knows you are the problem now.   They have complained, it is very clear THEY DO NOT WANT TO SEE YOU NAKED.  At this point it is harassment for them.  If I was their HR manager I would shut the whole job down until the problem was fixed.  No way would they allow a male to do this to women.  Hopefully they tell your husband soon.", "YTA. You know YTA. Not only are you exposing yourself to people who don\u2019t want to see it and haven\u2019t consented, you purposefully made up a fake account to avoid your husband finding out that you are flashing the construction workers.\n\nLet\u2019s be real here, sounds like this lady is hoping one of these workers stops by to say \u201chi\u201d while her husband is gone.", "YTA.Rulea are rules. I'm sure you would also be quick enough to complain if they were outside your window perving on you whilst you were getting changed. I wonder if you maybe are a bit of a voyeur and are enjoying the possible thrill of strange men seeing you naked? It's the only logical reason for why you wouldn't shut the blinds for the time it takes you to get dressed..", "YTA. Don\u2019t change in front of open/non blocked windows.", "Im going with soft YTA. I get your point but when you buy an apartment and not single house, aren't you signed up to be involved in the shared parts of building? Whats so hard about just leaving one room's curtain down and change in that room. The worker is just there and you are also just there, i cant blame the worker for not wanting to see naked ppl.", "YTA - I can understand why you\u2019re frustrated, but it\u2019s extremely normal to keep your curtains closed while getting dressed/walking around unclothed! Pretty much anyone who lives in a suburban home does this on a daily basis, to prevent their neighbours seeing them nude. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s asking too much to just pull the blinds down for the brief time it takes you to change.", "YTA The workers have a right to do their jobs without fear of having to see naked people. Would it be ok if you worked in an office and had to see strange men's private parts? For the next year, your building is their workplace. It is not unreasonable for you to take less than 30 seconds to close your bedroom window blinds while you're getting dressed and then open them back up. I agree the building is asking too much by wanting you to have all your blinds closed all day. But you are being rude and a creeper by purposefully exposing yourself to workers just trying to do their jobs.", "YTA I don\u2019t care how attractive you think you are you should respect the workers who don\u2019t want to see you while in their workplace.

And I agree asking everyone to keep their blinds closed 8-5 everyday for an entire year is excessive. I wouldn\u2019t follow that rule unless I was getting a huge break on my rent in exchange. But I\u2019d also make sure to close them when changing or doing private things! It\u2019s not hard!", "Weird *and* immature.", "I think you mean vulva, the vagina is inside", "Post like this come up all the time and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s fantasy writing.\n\nThere was one post on Reddit (not AITAH) that was basically \u201cmy GF and I went to get waxed, I accidentally came, the technician giggled and my GF found it hilarious\u201d. There\u2019s no way that was a true story.\n\nI find it hard to believe that there is a woman talking to strangers naked and doesn\u2019t think anything of it. It\u2019s easier to believe some dude has a fantasy about a woman that is unaware of her nudity.", "Actually, people have been charged for that. And people like OP are why. \n\nOtherwise perverts could flash people all day long, using that as a 'I'm not touching you' excuse", "you can and should be punished for doing things like OP. She knows people will be coming around passing by her windows and so she doesn't really have an expectation of privacy in this situation.", "While I agree that they shouldn't see naked bodies while at work, I still think it's ridiculous. A quick change shouldn't traumatize them. That's even more ridiculous. I still don't think the original gender reversed example is good enough. The maids are inside and deserve a safe space. I'm not saying the construction workers don't deserve a safe space but they're also hindering tenets lives by making them keep their blinders closed. What about people's plant life. Sorry but I wouldn't close my blinds. It takes 30 seconds to change. If they notice that someone is changing, yeah, they should look away. They aren't even sharing the same space! I'm going with ESH because I do believe it would be easy enough to close the blinds but I probably wouldn't even do that most days.", "It takes like 30 seconds to change and I wouldn't say it's being thrown in their face. They live on the 21st floor so they never even had to think about it before because who the hell will see them up there. It's not being shoved in their face. They're going past it. Not working directly on their apartment meaning they don't need to look. Looking in people's windows is not apart of their job description. They are there to work. Not be peeping toms.", "She didn\u2019t hire the workers", "Right! Feels like it\u2019s on purpose to me", "If I was walking down the street and looked into privately owned property and saw the owner of the property without his clothes I literally would not care. I wouldn\u2019t get upset that I saw a person inside their own home?", "Expecting people to keep their blinds closed during daylight hours is nuts and it's a damn shame people like the OP made that (attempt at) a rule necessary.  Like, go in the bathroom or shut your damn blinds for 5 minutes while you change!", "Haha yeah I was reading this going...I hope for her sake her vagina is never exposed \ud83e\udd23", "They've already had to see her naked at that point, it doesn't solve the problem if they turn their heads because they see she's naked.", ">She's in her home! The workers can turn around for a minute if it offends them.\n\nThat's a solution that sounds good on the surface, but has some problems when you look at it.  First off being they would need to see her naked to know to turn away. \n\nSo, they should see her naked, keep looking long enough to evaluate what she's doing and why she's naked so they know how long they need to stop working and turn away.\n\nI think that one failed once we recognized that they are having to see her naked at all.", "While on scaffolding 21 stories up?", "It takes less than 30 seconds to close the blinds before changing and then opening them again.", "By default, she did. The work is being done on her home. Her building hired them and she owns a unit in the building. Even if there is a governing board for the building, maintenance would fall on the homeowners there and she is a part of that. \n\nThis was obviously planned maintenance as the building gave them notice of the work.", "I don't know what to say in response to this, other than you really need to learn some empathy. I'm glad you're so desensitized to nudity, but most people are not.", "I'd just start changing my clothes in the bathroom or start closing the blinds if I were you, it doesn't seem like it'd be that big of a hassle?", "These aren\u2019t random people. Your building hired a crew to work outside your windows. They are there doing a job for you in order to maintain the exterior of your home. \n\nA small amount of respect has been requested in that you close your blinds while naked to make them feel more comfortable. This is not an absurd request. \n\nYou can show a bit of courtesy to the professionals you and the rest of the homeowners in the building hired to do work on your homes.", "You're still not understanding that if you were repeatedly seeing someone naked in their house you could choose to take a different path- these workers are doing their jobs and can't choose to not go past your window. Or that this isn't about you and what YOU are comfortable with? Someone complained and now you know so you are an asshole if you continue. But it sounds like you just don't care and no one can make you", "That's you. That's your personal preference. But, that doesn't apply to everyone nor does it apply to this situation. You have already been told that the workers do not consent to seeing your naked body while working because they have clearly stated so.\n\nIf someone lived in an area with large open windows, with the the inside clearly visible to the public, and they intentionally exposed themselves in clear view of passerbys, I'm pretty sure that wouldn't fly - private residence or not.\n\nEdit: Yup. Did a quick google search. Private residence or not, intentionally exposing yourself to the public isn't legal in most places. \n\nhttps://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/understanding-nudity-laws.html#:~:text=The%20law%20generally%20prohibits%20nudity,sunbathing%20naked%20in%20the%20yard.", "I don't disagree.", "Then she should have some respect for them and not expose them to her naked body, which they've made clear it's uncomfortable to them.", "I kind of understand seeing someone naked makes people uncomfortable, I guess. We all have the same bodies so I do find it ridiculous that so many throw hands to seeing something that they've seen before (50% chance they have the same body!)! But I can understand why. If you see someone changing and it makes you uncomfortable, wouldn't you just look away? Or would you stop and gawk and then complain that it makes you uncomfortable because your eyes strayed for too long. I understand them bringing attention to it if it's a regular occurrence but it sounds like a one of. Could be wrong on that though as OP doesn't state how many times they've changed in their direct view. OP should suck it up and go to the bathroom if they don't want to close the blinds but I do find the whole thing kinda comical. (I've worked retail and the amount of people that get angry and embarrassed when a mannequin isn't completely dressed boggles my mind. Not only is it plastic, but it shows even less of the bodies form.) I suspect half the people saying flat out that they're the a hole are people who also get mad at a plastic body being exposed for all to see. Oh My Eyes!"]}
