It\u2019s been a few days and she has not talked to me, AITA?\n\nEDIT: After reading comments, I just wanted to respond to some stuff after thinking the situation over.\n\nIt is a joint fridge, but she rarely uses it unless it\u2019s for small snacks. I primarily use it for meal preps and if I have food left over. This isn\u2019t an excuse and I know locking it was irrational, but it was the first and pretty effective thing I thought of. I will be talking things over with her and I am thinking of investing in a mini fridge or referencing one to her, because she uses our joint one less.

Or else you need to get a fridge lockbox, a mini fridge for your room, or a new room mate who doesn't steal and isn't childish.\n\nFridge lockboxes are probably the way to go.

I can't stand when a person eats my food and the person knows it's mine. Drunk or not, it's inconsiderate. Of course, telling her while she's drunk and angry why you did it will not go well.
