I also work hand in hand with the doctors and midwives to create a healthy maternity, birth, and postpartum situation. \n\nMy fiancee is completing her residency.  We live together and have for a few years now.  We aren't in any hurry to get married.  We originally had plans to do so a couple of years ago but then we got really busy for two years.  \n\nIt is driving my very religious parents crazy that their youngest son is living in sin.  I don't really care.  I'm an adult and I do what I want.  We are getting married in June.  \n\nSo we are visiting my parents for Christmas. The way it came together this year everyone is at my parents house.  So that's my folks, my three siblings, myself and fiancee, and seven grandchildren.  So seventeen people.  \n\nAt dinner my mom starts going on about how she is so glad that we are finally getting married and she won't be embarrassed at church any more.  And my dad says how proud he is of his three older kids who all either waited to get married before moving in together or got married right away after moving in together.  My fiancee was getting embarrassed and I was getting mad over this stupid argument we have had too many times. And a family dinner was the last straw.  \n\nI have asked them repeatedly to just accept that they cannot control how I live my life.  I refuse to stay with them when I visit even if I come alone.  Hotels are just easier.  \n\nSo I started talking about a premature baby I had been reading about.  It was almost three months premature and weighed about 1.6 pounds. It was super strong and healthy for being born so little and the NICU had high hopes for the baby doing well.  \n\nMy mom and dad both got deer in the headlights looks on their faces.  To bad. Should not have fucked around with my fiancee's feelings.  \n\nSo I asked about my oldest brother.  He was born almost four months premature.  Is there a chance that we could check out the family album where we keep all the records of family births and stuff.  \n\nI already know my brother was over 9 pounds and almost 23\" long when he was born.  My grandmother told me all about it the first time my parents tried to shame me. \n\nThe subject gets changed very fast.  After supper my parents told me that I should not try to embarrass them with private things that are not my concern.  I told them that if I heard anything about my living arrangements ever again for the rest of my life I would make sure to keep bringing up the FACT that my mom was in her second trimester when they got married.\n\nMy parents are mad at me for telling them how to behave in their own home.  But my fiancee is happy that they seem to be off the subject for good.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672058683, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvmflw/aita_for_bringing_up_my_brothers_premature_birth/", "score": 934, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm assuming the basis for this whole \"don't live together while unmarried\" bs is that once you live together, they are aware that you're having sex. So IF the reason they're uncomfortable is because they're so religious they can't cope with the idea of their unmarried kids having sex, they should be just as against moving in together right before the wedding. \nThey don't care about \"living in sin\", they care about what other people think.", "NTA.

So I'd advise you and your future wife/children to spend as little time under their roof as possible.", "NTA. My thinking with people like this is you give them a little leeway. A little. You can\u2019t change them, and normally a general sense of decency kicks in and they stop it. But in your case it sounds like they persisted. So it was time to stop the nonsense.", "YTA, on purpose, for an absolutely appropriate reason to be an AH. There really are good times to be a jerk, and these times are when confronted with people who are knowingly being disingenuous with you like this, even after you have specifically set boundaries.
