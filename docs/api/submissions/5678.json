I also work hand in hand with the doctors and midwives to create a healthy maternity, birth, and postpartum situation. \n\nMy fiancee is completing her residency.  We live together and have for a few years now.  We aren't in any hurry to get married.  We originally had plans to do so a couple of years ago but then we got really busy for two years.  \n\nIt is driving my very religious parents crazy that their youngest son is living in sin.  I don't really care.  I'm an adult and I do what I want.  We are getting married in June.  \n\nSo we are visiting my parents for Christmas. The way it came together this year everyone is at my parents house.  So that's my folks, my three siblings, myself and fiancee, and seven grandchildren.  So seventeen people.  \n\nAt dinner my mom starts going on about how she is so glad that we are finally getting married and she won't be embarrassed at church any more.  And my dad says how proud he is of his three older kids who all either waited to get married before moving in together or got married right away after moving in together.  My fiancee was getting embarrassed and I was getting mad over this stupid argument we have had too many times. And a family dinner was the last straw.  \n\nI have asked them repeatedly to just accept that they cannot control how I live my life.  I refuse to stay with them when I visit even if I come alone.  Hotels are just easier.  \n\nSo I started talking about a premature baby I had been reading about.  It was almost three months premature and weighed about 1.6 pounds. It was super strong and healthy for being born so little and the NICU had high hopes for the baby doing well.  \n\nMy mom and dad both got deer in the headlights looks on their faces.  To bad. Should not have fucked around with my fiancee's feelings.  \n\nSo I asked about my oldest brother.  He was born almost four months premature.  Is there a chance that we could check out the family album where we keep all the records of family births and stuff.  \n\nI already know my brother was over 9 pounds and almost 23\" long when he was born.  My grandmother told me all about it the first time my parents tried to shame me. \n\nThe subject gets changed very fast.  After supper my parents told me that I should not try to embarrass them with private things that are not my concern.  I told them that if I heard anything about my living arrangements ever again for the rest of my life I would make sure to keep bringing up the FACT that my mom was in her second trimester when they got married.\n\nMy parents are mad at me for telling them how to behave in their own home.  But my fiancee is happy that they seem to be off the subject for good.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672058683, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvmflw/aita_for_bringing_up_my_brothers_premature_birth/", "score": 48583, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Well played!", "NTA not at all. \n\nAside from the religious aspect, it\u2019s a pretty lousy thing to be disapproving of your child and shame his fianc\u00e9 because they\u2019re more worried about their reputation at church than they are about their family members. Where\u2019s their love and acceptance of their children? They\u2019re just being lousy human beings and parents in general. \n\nYou\u2019re right to set your boundaries. It doesn\u2019t matter if they are in your home, Their home, or in public, or anywhere else. They have no right to make any comment about your living situation and lifestyle. It\u2019s not their business what you do as an adult and individual. You have every right to tell them to stop and that it\u2019s not acceptable for them to do so. It\u2019s also the correct thing to do to defend your fianc\u00e9 and support her. Otherwise your parents will be crap in laws after the wedding when they find the next issue they have with you two. \n\nHonestly, if it were me, I\u2019d have point blank asked them to explain why they claim to have a premature baby who was born at a full term baby weight and length. I\u2019d have asked them directly if they actually got married while she was in her second trimester. Asking questions does not judge or condemn but does confront and put them in a position they have to acknowledge their past and their lies. That\u2019s what I would do next time they start on you and your fianc\u00e9. \n\nAlso, let\u2019s discuss religion. They\u2019re rather judgmental church members though, aren\u2019t they? They want to shame and persecute you and your fianc\u00e9 while still actively lying a decades long lie, and practiced promiscuity in premarital sex before they wed. Yet, it\u2019s okay for them to do it, but not anyone else. That\u2019s truly ridiculous. You didn\u2019t say what religion they are, but presuming they\u2019re Christians, they\u2019re totally off the mark as a good Christian as well. \n\nThe Bible doesn\u2019t say to shame or shun people living in sin. It doesn\u2019t say that some sins are ok and others not. It doesn\u2019t say you can correct a sin by doing anything other than repentance. So, basically just because they got married in the second trimester doesn\u2019t mean their sin was forgiven. It doesn\u2019t make the premarital sex they had forgiven. Only repentance directly to God does that. And They\u2019re STILL lying every single day. Yet, they are good Christian people who are ashamed of your lifestyle but yet. It was their lifestyle too. \n\nNor does the Bible say it\u2019s okay to judge others. In fact, the Bible is very clear. \u201cJudge not, lest ye be judged. Matt 7:1\u201c \nIt\u2019s also pretty clear about loving your neighbor- and that doesn\u2019t mean their physical neighbors - it means \u201cother people\u201d including their own children (Matt 22:37-39). Furthermore, the gospel talks repeatedly about hypocrisy and judgement and how it is wrong. \u201cHypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, then you shall see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye. Matt: 7:5 \u201c\n\nOne could sit and pass out thousands of verses to prove their behavior and judgment is incorrect, but then that would be passing judgment on to them as well. Point is, Christian people are expected to love and do right to others. There are thousands of verses teaching that very point. Jesus hates the sin and loves the sinner and tells us to do the same. He also went TO the people and reached them where they were at, not just physical location, but also their lifestyle and level of understanding. He didn\u2019t shun the outcasts and sinners. He sought them out. he welcomed them. He saved them with his crucifixion too. If your parents have missed the point to not judge, not condemn, not shame, then they are willfully ignoring the teachings of the Bible. \n\nNo matter how you look at it, secular or religious they are completely wrong and inappropriate.
