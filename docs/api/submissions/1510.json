Your right to keep your refrigerated items in your damn refrigerator wins out over a 4-year-old's right to play with anything he wants to play with.

Sheesh...", "**NTA** \n\nYou are being the responsible one.", "NTA!  I can't, for the life of me, understand why his parents think that playing with anything but TOYS is not safe for the child or acceptable behaviors!  What he is doing, playing with appliances like refrigerators, could get him killed!  Many kids have died after playfully climbing into refrigerators or freezers and closing the door behind them.  Once inside, they can't get back out.  Air runs out, quickly, and they die.  Kids love pretend play, but there are play houses and kitchens and all sort of toys available that kids can play to their hearts content.  Your cousin's parents sound a bit dimwitted, to say the least.  For his safety, I'm glad you've spoken up even if he cries and parents behave badly.  I feel sorry for that child, as he seems to be getting no guidance at all.", "NTA, they obviously don\u2019t realize how dangerous the fridge can be\u2026or maybe they do.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nHow should he ever learn what is and isn't okay, if noone ever says no to him? It's absolutely alright to set boundaries even for kids that age. But maybe as a compromise, you could prepare one cupboard for him to \"play house\" with, if he is over at your place a lot.\n\nAlso, playing in the fridge could obviously be dangerous and even life threatening, so your aunt and uncle should have thanked you for preventing a possible tragedy.", "NTA...but your uncle and aunt are ridiculous \ud83d\ude44...\nThe food is not the issue in this particular instance ~it's the playing in the refrigerator! What are they thinking?", "NTA. Your fridge, your food and the reaction of the parents explains this kind of behaviour", "NTA \n\nEmptying the fridge is the first step. Climbing into it and locking himself inside accidentally or on purpose is next, with deadly consequences too.", "NTA. Kids shouldn\u2019t be playing in fridges. And the kid shouldn\u2019t throw a tantrum when basic parenting is finally happening.", "NTA\n\nThe kid needs a really BIG box to make his \"house\".  Seriously or a fort building kit.  My son has always been obsessed with building forts.  I have encouraged such behavior by getting him things of that nature and encouraging(redirecting) to the positive behavior and away from the negative one of taking all my stuff to build forts with.\n\nYour Aunt and Uncle are T A for calling you a killjoy and thinking a fridge is a proper place for a small child to play in.  Refrigerator box would be fine.  The actual fridge is not.", "NTA\nIt is not safe to play house in a fridge. They are usually pretty tightly sealed to prevent the cold from escaping. A kid can suffocate in a fridge.", "NTA no child should ever be allowed to play in a fridge, they can suffocate quickly in there and dozens have died this way", "NTA. The kid's safety is at sake -refrigerators are dangerous things to play in- and that's not even getting into the problem with taking everything out of the fridge. It may be time to childproof the thing.", "Uhm, kids die in refrigerators.  NTA.  If he's playing house inside the fridge at home, you need to place a call to children's services.

Kids die when they shut themselves in fridges.", "Anyone ever seen the Punky Brewster episode when Cherry gets stuck in the fridge when they are playin hide and seek? Or am I old as fuck now? That episode was made to warn kids to not hide in fridges or play (in this scenario) NTA.

Refrigerated food should never be removed for reasons other than use or disposal. And even if the fridge was empty, if the door closed and he got stuck inside he could suffocate. No reason for fridge play.", "So, what he's doing isn't abnormal but he needs boundaries. You can play with all of the Tupperware and play house. You may not take things out of the fridge..these types of permission with boundaries let the kids experiment but also respect other people. But at 4, I would calmly explain why or ask questions. Like, remember when I told you that you can't take things out of the fridge... I know you were upset and so was I. Why does food go in the fridge? Ok, and if we take it out, what happens? Right it goes bad. And if it goes bad, do we have food to eat? If it goes in the trash, can I eat it? O, I can't... That seems like a problem... What if I'm hungry? What if you are hungry? Hmmm...  So, it doesn't seem like things from the fridge are a good idea to play with. What might be something else we can use around the house? This type of conversation I have with my son all the time. Although varies in how much detail we go into based on his energy level and ability to follow the conversation, but he generally gets it. The explaination allows it to be more than a rule. It gives understandkng. And by asking questions you allow him to figure out the why. I'd also mention, that this conversation rarely happens for us in the moment because I'm about to lose it \ud83d\ude02 it happens after when we are both calm because I yelled, no, not the eggs!!!! And he freezes and then we both go sort out feelings. Nta", "ESH because obviously you are keeping your nephew safe by keeping him out of the fridge his parents should understand and recognize that, but you do seem like a killjoy based on the words you use.. \u201cweird obsession\u201d - he\u2019s four, literally all children are \u2018obsessed\u2019 with some sort of play at that age. \u2018He gets mad when you tell him it\u2019s not his house\u2019 - there are better ways to redirect playful energy than crushing the imagination they\u2019re submersed in.\n\nCertain language/words people use when describing children & situations involving them shows a disliking towards them and those are always the type of people im wary about giving 1on1 time with a younger child to.", "NTA. Kids don't play in refrigerators.  Kids DIE in refrigerators.  Don't back down on this one.   You did the right thing.   People will think I am mean, but a little crying helps a child remember.   The act of crying releases chemical in the brain that enhances memory.   Spanking in not the tool for generating tears.   Spanking is abuse in my book.", "NTA tell them to replace the groceries that get damaged or spoiled next time he does it", "NTA\n\nLet him die in their fridge because they're idiots", "NTA but if he's allowed to do this, he might die.  Your aunt and uncle are negligent parents.  Call them out for being bad parents and ask them why they're risking your cousin's life.", "NTA!!  Remind them that one day they will not be paying attention to where he is and they will be the killjoys when they find that he has passed away in the fridge.", "NTA Not only is he being destructive to your stuff, playing in the fridge is deadly.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt and uncle are unreasonable and spoiling the boy.  \n\n He has to learn he can't just use whatever he wants to play with when visiting other people's homes. \n\nMaybe you could pick up a small, cheap cabinet for him to play with during his visits.", "NTA. It's a pity your aunt and uncle are not adequately parenting him and that you have to.", "Do your aunt and uncle know that children die every year in fridges? NTA.", "NTA. Would they rather you be a \u201cKi11joy\u201d or a \u201cKi11er\u201d? Playing in the fridge is dangerous. You did the right thing.", "NTA. Kids need boundaries, and they need them to be consistent and firm. \n\nIf it were your kid, I would suggest explaining the reasons (not safe, not your food, etc) but this is really their parents responsibility. It's a shame they don't seem to take it seriously.", "Nta...scare tactic....google the old Punky Brewster episode where her friend got stuck in an old fridge and almost became unalive.", "Exactly. It's a dangerous thing to allow him to do. NTA for sure.", "The crying thing I agree with 100%. Why do we shame crying? It's about learning. It's an emotional response. Why are tears considered something parents should try and avoid causing. You almost killed yourself and I had to grab you, yes, some tears to understand that wasn't ok and to help you learnm (also agree on the no spanking!). Also, your kid crying doesn't mean something is truly wrong or you did something wrong (it can, that's why parents need to self-reflect). It's an emotion! They are learning to deal with the feelings. Stop shaming them for feeling things deeply.", "Well, if they continue letting him play in fridges they may soon find there is no child alive for them to not bother  parenting", "I think I'm still scarred by that Punky Brewster episode."]}
