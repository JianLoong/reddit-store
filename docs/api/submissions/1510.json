I can't, for the life of me, understand why his parents think that playing with anything but TOYS is not safe for the child or acceptable behaviors!  What he is doing, playing with appliances like refrigerators, could get him killed!  Many kids have died after playfully climbing into refrigerators or freezers and closing the door behind them.  Once inside, they can't get back out.  Air runs out, quickly, and they die.  Kids love pretend play, but there are play houses and kitchens and all sort of toys available that kids can play to their hearts content.  Your cousin's parents sound a bit dimwitted, to say the least.  For his safety, I'm glad you've spoken up even if he cries and parents behave badly.

It's absolutely alright to set boundaries even for kids that age.

Refrigerated food should never be removed for reasons other than use or disposal. And even if the fridge was empty, if the door closed and he got stuck inside he could suffocate. No reason for fridge play.", "So, what he's doing isn't abnormal but he needs boundaries. You can play with all of the Tupperware and play house. You may not take things out of the fridge..these types of permission with boundaries let the kids experiment but also respect other people. But at 4, I would calmly explain why or ask questions. Like, remember when I told you that you can't take things out of the fridge... I know you were upset and so was I. Why does food go in the fridge? Ok, and if we take it out, what happens? Right it goes bad. And if it goes bad, do we have food to eat? If it goes in the trash, can I eat it? O, I can't... That seems like a problem... What if I'm hungry? What if you are hungry? Hmmm...  So, it doesn't seem like things from the fridge are a good idea to play with. What might be something else we can use around the house? This type of conversation I have with my son all the time. Although varies in how much detail we go into based on his energy level and ability to follow the conversation, but he generally gets it. The explaination allows it to be more than a rule. It gives understandkng. And by asking questions you allow him to figure out the why. I'd also mention, that this conversation rarely happens for us in the moment because I'm about to lose it \ud83d\ude02 it happens after when we are both calm because I yelled, no, not the eggs!!!! And he freezes and then we both go sort out feelings. Nta", "ESH because obviously you are keeping your nephew safe by keeping him out of the fridge his parents should understand and recognize that, but you do seem like a killjoy based on the words you use.. \u201cweird obsession\u201d - he\u2019s four, literally all children are \u2018obsessed\u2019 with some sort of play at that age. \u2018He gets mad when you tell him it\u2019s not his house\u2019 - there are better ways to redirect playful energy than crushing the imagination they\u2019re submersed in.\n\nCertain language/words people use when describing children & situations involving them shows a disliking towards them and those are always the type of people im wary about giving 1on1 time with a younger child to.", "NTA. Kids don't play in refrigerators.  Kids DIE in refrigerators.  Don't back down on this one.   You did the right thing.   People will think I am mean, but a little crying helps a child remember.   The act of crying releases chemical in the brain that enhances memory.   Spanking in not the tool for generating tears.   Spanking is abuse in my book.", "NTA tell them to replace the groceries that get damaged or spoiled next time he does it", "NTA\n\nLet him die in their fridge because they're idiots", "NTA but if he's allowed to do this, he might die.  Your aunt and uncle are negligent parents.  Call them out for being bad parents and ask them why they're risking your cousin's life.", "NTA!!  Remind them that one day they will not be paying attention to where he is and they will be the killjoys when they find that he has passed away in the fridge.", "NTA Not only is he being destructive to your stuff, playing in the fridge is deadly.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt and uncle are unreasonable and spoiling the boy.  \n\n He has to learn he can't just use whatever he wants to play with when visiting other people's homes. \n\nMaybe you could pick up a small, cheap cabinet for him to play with during his visits.", "NTA. It's a pity your aunt and uncle are not adequately parenting him and that you have to.", "Do your aunt and uncle know that children die every year in fridges? NTA.", "NTA. Would they rather you be a \u201cKi11joy\u201d or a \u201cKi11er\u201d? Playing in the fridge is dangerous. You did the right thing.", "NTA. Kids need boundaries, and they need them to be consistent and firm. \n\nIf it were your kid, I would suggest explaining the reasons (not safe, not your food, etc) but this is really their parents responsibility. It's a shame they don't seem to take it seriously.", "Nta...scare tactic....google the old Punky Brewster episode where her friend got stuck in an old fridge and almost became unalive.", "Exactly. It's a dangerous thing to allow him to do. NTA for sure.", "The crying thing I agree with 100%. Why do we shame crying? It's about learning. It's an emotional response. Why are tears considered something parents should try and avoid causing. You almost killed yourself and I had to grab you, yes, some tears to understand that wasn't ok and to help you learnm (also agree on the no spanking!). Also, your kid crying doesn't mean something is truly wrong or you did something wrong (it can, that's why parents need to self-reflect). It's an emotion! They are learning to deal with the feelings. Stop shaming them for feeling things deeply.", "Well, if they continue letting him play in fridges they may soon find there is no child alive for them to not bother  parenting", "I think I'm still scarred by that Punky Brewster episode.", "NTA. Kids don't play in refrigerators. That's ridiculous.\n\nEdit: kids should never be allowed to play in refrigerators, is what I mean.", "Um. What?  My kid loving playing that game too. So much that I had an entire cupboard set up with easily removable, non-breakable things for her. She did not EVER get to play that game with the fridge. \n\nKids have died in refrigerators. \n\nAlso?   A 4 year old is a menace to himself and everyone and everything around him. It is the job of his caregiver(s) to help him understand acceptable behavior and protect him from himself as needed. Your aunt & uncle are failing miserably at that. \n\nDo NOT apologize to those people.\n\nEdit: NTA", "If they don't set boundaries for what is, and is not, a safe place to \"play house\", they are going to be the ultimate killjoys when their kid is dead.  Their kid could suffocate in the goddamned fridge.  Never mind the fact that it is entirely inappropriate for their kid to be throwing away your shit, or risking it going bad because it's not properly cooled.\n\nObviously NTA.", "NTA and his parents sound like they have a very poor grasp on health and safety. Kids can die if they shut themselves in fridges/freezers", "NTA but that aunt and uncle are.", "You are NTA. Kids do not play in fridges and I don't understand why kid's parents called you a killjoy. You are no killjoy and fridges are not appropriate places to play house for kids", "NTA your aunt and uncle are though.  To not set boundaries with a child will only reap disaster in the future.  You can hold this moment in your mind, and when junior goes off the rails and they ask where they went wrong, you have this to bring up.", "NTA\n\nThis is, as many here have pointed out, a safety issue.  If he gets trapped in the fridge, he could die.  And if he's throwing away your food, you have to replace it, and that's expensive.\n\nBut...\n\nHe's four.  Kids get into these types of obsessions, and get out of them fairly quickly.  Playing games focused on things they are interested in and learning about in their daily life is very normal and a healthy way for such a young child to learn.  He seems to be at a point where he's learning to understand about the kitchen and fridge, and that food comes out of the fridge, and things like that.  When he's sorted that out in his head, he'll go on to focus his play on new ideas.  \n\nIn the meantime, redirecting is often more effective than \"No.\"\n\nMaybe, when he comes over, use a couple chairs and an old sheet or blanket to make a \"tent\" he can play house in. Put in a couple of non-breakable pots and pans, and a few other safe items to make it home like.  Maybe a small blanket and pillow \"bed\"?  You might even put a few cans of food in a box, on its side with the flaps as \"doors\" to be a safe play-fridge. \n\nIf he's trying to hide in things to \"play house\" he seems to want a quiet place to be alone.  Give him a safe place, where he knows he's welcome, and where he can explore the ideas he's interested in right now safely.", "Ugh parents like your aunt and uncle are why there are so many spoiled entitled brats running around. NTA in the slightest.", "Replace the baby, more like.", "It would be hilarious if there was Iranian yogurt in that fridge.", "I seriously don\u2019t think how OP has described the situation here is the issue. I\u2019d be a bit more worried about the dangers of suffocation than the words used by someone who may not have much experience with kids", "That\u2019s what I was thinking.  Playing house, normal, in a fridge, abnormal!  Get the kid a big huge box or a bunch of cardboard and tape", "NTA--all I see is the Punky Brewster where Cheri climbed in the fridge and almost died, and ended up needing  CPR. I get playing house but not in the fridge", "Like I said, he\u2019s not in the wrong for steering the kid away from the fridge and correcting that behaviour.", "It\u2019s not even regular \u201cplaying house\u201d - he\u2019s just making a big mess. His parents need to stop him for their own and others\u2019 sanity but also to teach him it isn\u2019t appropriate to snoop and rummage through other\u2019s things."]}
