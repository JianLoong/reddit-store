A few detentions here and there for excessive talking and stuff along those lines. My other 2 siblings are completely different. Hazel lives with my dad and stepmom and recently they had to transfer her to a different school because her bullying was so bad. By this I mean, she was the bully, not the bullied. She was very mean to many students and is just a horrible person, but my mom doesn\u2019t care because she\u2019s smart and pretty. Jace is just as bad, when we came home for Thanksgiving, he was laughing about him and his friends bullying a boy to tears for being too \u201cgay\u201d, and how he was upset he was suspended over that. What\u2019s worse is my uncle (26m), mom\u2019s brother, will defend him because he \u201chad a homophobic stage\u201d, and is now openly gay and very feminine.\n\nWe got Gunner some stuff from sports memorabilia websites, including some extremely expensive items. I know he\u2019ll love them. We got him a few other things such as clothes.\u00a0\n\nMy dad and stepmom were fine with this, however when my mom found out, she flipped out saying he wasn\u2019t my \u201creal brother\u201d.

Do they know this is how the system works? Have you gotten them gifts every year before this? \n\nThey sound like they've got serious attitude problems, and if the point is that you're taking a stand on bullying and homophobia, good for you! But if they don't know from you that's why they didn't get gifts and that from now on that's the rule, it just looks like playing favorites or neglect during, you know, Christmas.", "Your mom and her kids are AHs.. but you are their sister  not Santa with a naughty and nice list. That SAID.. having a conversation with them about their behaviors and how disappointing it is to hear these things is 100% acceptable.   If they don't receive it, tell you off, treat you with disrespect, etc.. than I would not get them anything either.  Essentially, I think it's only fair to give them a chance to course correct or understand who you are and what you expect before taking punitive action.. but at the end of the day.. it's your money and your choice.  If you think it's worth damaging your relationship with them, it doesn't make you an AH.", "NTA. But may I suggest you let the children know exactly why they are not receiving gifts?

Until you learn to be kind to others, I will be donating the value of your Christmas presents to X charity to help the people that you have hurt this year\u201d.

That's not your responsibility. \n\nAre you trying to teach them a lesson? This isn't the best way to do that.

That would probably be more informative for them than the act of withholding gifts.", "ESH. Your mom saying Gunner is not your \u201creal\u201d brother is cruel. And your parents not parenting Hazel and Gunner is concerning. Their behavior sounds truly terrible. \n\nBut the thing is, they are not fully formed. They are thirteen and 10. TEN!  I would worry if I were you that if they continue like this they may turn into terrible adults, but it is too early, and they are too young to write them off entirely. And you are their sister, not their parent. It is not for you to reward or punish their behavior.

Understand, however, those kids are not going to see it as punishment.

It\u2019s a natural consequence of their behaviour.

Not to mention why is your sister so insecure she has to put others down to feel better about herself? Your brother is 10 and maybe he\u2019s saying homophobic things, but this is the perfect chance to open the conversation about why he thinks those things and why he might be wrong vs just lashing out and being mean to him.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry but there\u2019s a lot to be said about positive reinforcement being more beneficial than negative reinforcement when it comes to behaviour. You could have used this as an opportunity to help them with their struggles in their personal lives. Instead you\u2019re being very judgy of some very young kids. Telling kids they are bad people and shaming them into being better doesn\u2019t work as well as you might think. Examples of kindness and love do wonders. Especially when you explain why.

They need a reality check.", "Brilliant idea", "I could learn so much from both of you.", "I do not think unconditional love is something that should be reserved for parent-child relationships. \n\nIt's perfectly acceptable to tell someone, \"I love you, but you're being an asshole and you need to change your behavior.\"\n\n Unconditional love and calling people out on their misdeeds are not mutually exclusive. In fact, people are more likely to listen and adjust their behavior when they are confronted by someone who loves and cares for them.", "But whose job is it to curb the behavior? Not their sister. And does withholding presents actually do anything to correct their behavior? I don\u2019t think so. And how does one do that? I\u2019m with others who are of the opinion that it\u2019s not generally a good idea to use presents to punish.  At some point sister will have to decide if she wants a relationship with her siblings, and what she wants it to be. If she wants to cut them out entirely, then sure, no presents. But I figure she may want to wait till they are closer to adults to make that call. If she wants a relationship with them that will allow her to be some sort of positive influence on their lives, and given that she is not their day to day parent, I don\u2019t think trying to make a statement at Christmas is the right play.", "What makes you think there are no consequences? Just because she listed off their wrong doings doesn\u2019t mean they were never disciplined.\n\nNot to mention we know virtually nothing about these kids and their lives. Maybe they have their own traumas they are hiding behind bad behaviour. This is why it\u2019s not up to people that are not their parents to decide how children should be punished.

We are taught from a young age at Christmas that when we are bad we do not receive presents. I don't know why people are saying YTA when this is literally ingrained in us as we learn about Christmas.

NTA.", "Please listen closely: bullies don't grow out of nowhere and kids don't decide to be mean to each other because they were born that way, unless they are sociopaths. Why does one side of the family has so many bullies? I think you are trying to make a point here to the wrong people. You are treating the symptoms and not the cause, which from the little you wrote appears to be your mother. NTA for not wanting to get the kids presents, but understand that the situation is more complex than that.", "This is awesome.", "I'm so down with this, especially if it's a large enough for a tax break,  but not big one.
