It shrunk their space, gave extra hand holds and kept toys close.", "NTA. Tell his girlfriend to shut the fuck up and mind her own business.", "NTA you're trying to help your son. Bottom line. He could wear swim trunks and it's not anything sexual. It is understandable if his focus is on you trying to see him naked, why his girlfriend would be furious. Just make it clear to her that you weren't trying to do that, he was wearing swim trunks, and that bottom line you're just trying to make sure your son manages to get a bath. And bath time with your son shouldn't be made into anything sexual.", "NTA, your ex sounds delusional and ridiculous why would you want to see him naked, and yes none of his gf's business", "INFO Did you stay in the bathroom while all of this occurred or did you leave once your ex was getting undressed? And did he actually get fully nude or did he wear trunks?", "NTA. He\u2019s his son ffs. How tf do you guys manage to find such dense people out there. Ex\u2019s gf is just jealous. She can go fuck herself, its none of her business", "As a young girl I was terrified of the shower, we where poor and running a bath every night was expensive so mum really wanted me to start showering as I was well old enough\n\nMy Nana was the genius that decided to take a shower with me fully naked nothing sexual she was my Nana and besides a few questions about why her body was so different to mine it went great showered like a big girl after that.", "NTA. Amazingly mothers can just want what is best for the child and it doesn\u2019t have to be about her wanting to sleep with her ex. \ud83d\ude44 as a mom I would have suggested the same thing. Kid is scared, kid needs comfort and to see it\u2019s okay. Even if you were the one to get in with the kid, you wouldn\u2019t most likely be there every time so that wouldn\u2019t work.", "NTA\n\nYour ex should have tried bathing with your son long ago, or helped your son take a shower. It is obvious you didn't want to see your ex naked. He is your ex, after all, and I presume you've already seen him naked. I don't know what his gf's problem is, but it is HER problem and not yours.", "NTA. It's normal to bath with your kid, naked or not. Some kids need that support.", "NTA, you\u2019re trying to make your son comfortable and your ex doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s even trying to help. I think having him do that was successful and the more it\u2019s done the more used to it your son will be. But screw the jealous girlfriend of your ex, she must not have kids to immediately be so selfish to think this is about something else.\n\nAlso people saying is sexualizing a toddler\u2026 how? I\u2019m so confused", "NTA a parent does whatever the child needs. It is called being responsible for the sake of your child. Put on swim trunks & suck it up Dad.", "No judgement. Just wanted to laugh at the new GF who has no situational sense whatsoever xD", "**ESH**\n\nGirlfriend needs to MHOB. Everyone needs to stop sexualizing the toddler. It\u2019s understandable he\u2019s scared of bathing if it\u2019s too big. My grandkids (now 4 & 2) were terrified of my jacuzzi tub (especially the jets) & refused to bathe unless it was a shower only now I can\u2019t get them out & they love the jets especially when I put bath bombs & bubble bath in. If he\u2019s that scared then you need to find a way to make it less scary. Add bath toys, bath paints, color tablets (sold at Walmart), & bath bombs. Let him shower or simply use a large tote to bathe him (tote inside the tub). He\u2019ll get over his fear eventually IF he associates bath with being fun.", "ESH. \n\nNo is a complete sentence. Once your ex said no that should have been the end of it and back to the drawing board. The girlfriend is the other AH for interfering. Skip the bath that night, suggest a tub insert or offering the kid a shower versus \"making\" your ex get into the tub. Because again, no is a complete sentence.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Tell your ex to put on his swimsuit.  Nothing inappropriate about it - the kids 3.", "NTA. It's a damn toddler and he's going to have to properly bath him anyway. It's easier to do inside the tub them leaning over it the whole time", "NTA. We went through a similar phase. Only in our case the kiddo was afraid of water in any form when in came to washing. Even washing the hands was a battle. Often his dad would hold him under the spray (only shower stall, no bathtub) and I would do the washing. Dad would go in covered and after would change into dry clothes. \n\nTell ex he can go in fully clothed if that's what it takes. Or tell the girlfriend to hop in the tub. As long as it helps getting the job done i think either will do. \n\nAlso, why won't the dad wash him? Why are you required to be there? Let him get in the tub and while there wash the kid. You don't need to be there for it.", "NTA, but I do believe that everyone has their own comfort level. Perhaps the Dad is just uncomfortable getting in a tub with his Son. Their might be an underlying reason he (the Dad) was uncomfortable.", "YTA you pressured him to do something he wasn't comfortable with. It is her business because it's her partner", "ESH - You're both sexualizing your kid and prioritizing your comfort over your child's.", "What are you doing dictating your ex's parenting in his home? YTA.", "NTA.  I briefly contemplated a N A H response since the ex has a right to not want to get into the tub, but his whole accusing you of wanting to see him naked makes it clear this is less about some sort of discomfort and more about him being more generally an AH.  His girlfriend in particular.\n\nWashing kids sucks.  Washing hair is worse.  You try to make it work however you can.  There are limits, and sometimes the kid is just going to cry, but that comment gives him away as an AH.", "[deleted]", "THIS", "Yes, but why is she even there? She says she has no clothes to change into so she doesn't live there. Is dad incompetent at washing a kid? Give him pointers and get out of the bathroom or tell him what to do and don't come altogether.", "Or he can get in completely clothed. Nta", "I was in there but he changed into his trunks in his bedroom so I wasn't watching him undress or anything like that.", "Aww this is so sweet!", "I, a woman, took baths with both my parents when I was small, and regularly saw them naked. Same with my kids today. No one is going out of their way to expose themselves, but if you're going to run down the hall in your birthday suit after a bath, or barge in on me when I'm changing, that's what happens. It's only a big deal if you choose to make it into one. \n\nThis reminds me of a former teacher of mine who once had to deal with a 5yo who had been taught he wasn't supposed to look at his own genitals when he went to the bathroom. So he would close his eyes and, of course, get pee everywhere. People get weird...", "How is this sexualizing the toddler I\u2019m confused\u2026", "Toddlers cannot bathe by themselves??", "Then why did he try to pressure her to do it even when she didn\u2019t have clean clothes to change into? Also bathing with a child while in swim trunks to help them be less scared is a really weird thing to be uncomfortable about.", "What? I\u2019m confused, how is this sexualizing a kid?", "Because he apparently can't do it by himself.", "This is a terrible idea.  Please don't do it.  What if your child tries to stand up and flips the basket. \nIf there's a separate shower, that's a couple inches deep, stopper the drain, and use that as a small bathtub.  Or maybe he would like a shower? \nAnd I think getting in the tub or shower with a kiddos that's unsure is perfectly fine,  as well.", "Seems like a one time thing when they were trying to get to the bottom of why he dislikes baths so much at the dad\u2019s house.", "She's there to try teach him how she would do the bathtime routine, that her son is fine with. Her son didn't like baths at dad's, so mum went and did the right thing to make sure her child isn't getting so stressed at bath time.  \n\nMy daughter is 2 and she loves having baths with me, her father. She's fine without me, but she's alot more happier and having more fun if I'm in with her", "Then NTA. Your ex needs to act like a father and contribute to parenting your child. If bath time was that much of a struggle at his place specifically, he should've been willing to help ease your kid's fears. And if nothing unsavory was going on, the GF needs to butt out and understand that she's dating someone with a child, and that the child needs to be the priority to your ex. Who, by the way, was suggesting that YOU get in with him, fully nude, making him the one turning the situation into something unsavory.", "I took baths/showers with my mama and grandma so it was pretty normal.", "I think they mean that saying a kid shouldn't see their parent naked, or how being naked whild their kid is brings in the worries of adults who see nudity as sexualizing.\n\nSo it's then projecting their sexual ideas of nudity on a child that has no idea/nor would have an issue. I used to shower/bathe with parents at that age and they didn't act weird about it, so it wasn't.", "Also confused about that one.", "Cuz she's the mom and he's the boyfriend that probably isn't very close to the kid. Also why not just put the clothes she was wearing back on if she's gonna be in them anyway", "Replied elsewhere but it's the fact that a kid sees nothing wrong with nudity, and the parent (aka dad) is forcing his adult sexualized ideas of nudity on that situation.\n\nA kid won't think anything of bathing nude with an also nude parent. But If a parent feels weird bout being nude in front of a kid it's likely due to societal norms of 'nudity is only sexual'", "It isn't like the parent plunks them down and walks away. Supervision is a necessary part of the bath routine - even in a regular tub. Ironically this was a tip given in my parenting classes.", "You don't leave a child unattended in the bath...", "Perhaps. Still, how small is the child that she must stay in there with them? My point stands: give advice, pointers and get out. He has to learn to take care of his son without you around. And you must learn to let it happen. \n\n\nI'm not dismissing OP's view. The jealousy fit and the accusations seem blown out. I would've rolled my eyes so hard at them. Like come on.", "Yeah I get that but these people were arguing about ex\u2019s seeing each other undressed, not able the child seeing them with little to no clothes. Which is why I was confused able the \u201cchild being sexualized\u201d part haha", "I think it might be bc the dad was uncomfortable with getting in the bath with his son and then making his ex do it instead. But I perceived it as that he just didn\u2019t want to bathe him with more work.", "He\u2019s the FATHER of the child so I\u2019d guess he\u2019s actually VERY close to the kid. And this was his tub at his house that she was visiting to help with the bathing issues.", "Wait what, he\u2019s as much of a parent as she is and equally responsible. Weird that he would rather make her get back into dirty clothes than help out when it\u2019s HIS visitation time since he was at his dads house.", "I thought it was more him thinking it was weird to bathe with his kid. So maybe I misunderstood. Either way he had swim trunks, and it isn't like she hasn't seen him nude to idk....make the baby. But I'd say his reluctance to get in a tub with kid even with shorts is more an issue than this whole ex mess.", "I thought OP was mom? But tbh I still don\u2019t fully see anything. Really interested in the original commenter explaining their thought process.", "Calling him ex instead of dad made me think he's a different person. Also doesn't explain the clothes thing", "I misunderstood. Also she's making herself stay in clean clothes so it still doesn't make sense", "Oh I didn\u2019t even think of it like that. I thought he was just too lazy to do it because he was making his ex do it instead. Either way it shouldn\u2019t have been a big deal hah", "Yes OP is mom but she said her sons father didn\u2019t want to bathe with his son to help his fear of the tub.", "Wait do you not know that baby daddies exist? Why else would an ex have visitation rights to her son?", "If she showered she would be cleaner than before and be forced to put on clothes that are probably getting dirty from natural daily body odors, etc.", "Def agree there, both sides are just this guy being lazy and him not making his GF stfu about how they raise their kid.", "I know they exist I just got confused because she called them two things which usually doesn't happen in these stories", "So she'd just end up being slightly cleaner than before? What's the issue", "The title says father of OUR child but I can totally see how u missed that.", "This issue is that it\u2019s his son too and he should be able to help bathe him in his own house where he has all his clean clothes, during his own visitation time.", "Yeah sometimes things are overlooked. I'm sensing hostility over a matter that affects neither of us from an internet stranger. You upset bud?", "I know I agree, im not on that anymore. But her dirty clothes don't really seem like an issue if she's going to be in them anyway", "I\u2019m just very passionate about how parents are viewed in society and these conversations, that many people will see , need to be done. There\u2019s no hostility towards you specifically, just about the issue at hand.", "I mean it\u2019s not like she\u2019s going to bathe in her clothes, she\u2019s going to take them off,get cleaner, and then have to put them on again. You are just talking in circles here I\u2019m out\u270c\ud83c\udffc"]}
