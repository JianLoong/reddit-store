But when it comes to my own birthday money and wanting to save it, I didn\u2019t feel obligated to donate it. \n\nMy mom kept insisting due to her Hindu beliefs, so I found a way to turn them on her: by her logic, people who do good receive good fortune, and that\u2019s why I should donate. By that logic, people who do bad receive bad fortune, and hence the people in bad positions in life are only there because they did bad things. So if I donate money to help those in need, I\u2019m depriving them of the punishment God and Karma put them in for being bad.\n\nOf course, this is BS, but she couldn\u2019t argue with my logic, so she said fine and let me keep my money, but called me selfish. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true\u2014 as I said, I work for charities, out of genuine passion rather than to secure good karma for myself, so I\u2019m already ahead of her in that aspect.

Your money do as you wish. You donate you time. That's more than a lot of people do.", "NTA. Ya should be able ta do whatever you want with your own birthday money. I don't really believe in karma but I certainly think that if it was real, you already have and probably will maintain very good karma from your passion in charity alone. It's important to do good things for yourself too sometimes.", "If you could defeat religion with logic there'd be no religion.\n\nMore importantly, donating money is the laziest form of charity.

By the time you\u2019re 17, you\u2019re clearly old enough to have the right to exercise your own autonomy over your principles; religious and otherwise. Your mom can do what she wants with her money, she can encourage you to do what she believes is best; but she has no right to compel your adherence to her beliefs.\n\nEdited to add: As a nearly lifelong agnostic who leans rather heavily toward atheism (the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence and all that), it\u2019s pretty useless to argue with somebody over morality within the confines of their faith. You\u2019re not an asshole for doing it, you\u2019re just wasting your time and mental energy while creating the perception that you\u2019re able to be lobbied and perhaps persuaded by their religious moralisms in the future. It becomes an open invitation to scrutinize your decisions and autonomy against an exterior ethos. My advice, just be honest about why your answer is no. It might be a headache in the short term, but eventually people stop.", "NTA. but that belief feels weirdly self defeating. Like, if you're just doing good acts to further your own karma, doesn't that kind of negate the whole intent?
