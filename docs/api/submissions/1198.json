OBro had been listening and he came downstairs and took the Legend of zelda BOTW switch cartridge from my switch that he had lended to me, he also blocked me and Bro on discord and called me a selfish entitled asshole for talking to our mother behind his back when he complains about me and Bro to his online friends all the time behind our backs.\n\nOne more detail I almost forgot to add was that OBro is applying to his first job so he's super stressed right now.\n\nAm I the asshole for not just buying him stuff and keeping my feelings to myself? (Sorry this was so long)\n\n(Update: He just busted into the front room and not only gave me back the cartridge but also skyward sword, I gave them back to him, but I think that might've been his way of apologising, and Thanks to everyone taking the time to reply)", "created_utc": 1667569495, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylzguk/aita_for_not_buying_my_older_brother_what_he/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
