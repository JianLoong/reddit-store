My ex was the problem, but even when we knew it was him, he would make comments about how I couldn\u2019t have children (while shaking his head in disappointment). Like it should just be women\u2019s burden to bare that accusation. \n\nBesides, were you supposed to never announce your pregnancy?", "Congrats on the pregnancy!\n\nNTA...he was emotionally abusive in your marriage.

How delusional of your ex MIL to try to twist it like your announcement had ANYTHING to do with your ex-husband. That's just wild, lol. \n\nYou don't live your life to cater to your ex. He's history, your current pregnancy has nothing to do with him, and you have EVERY right to announce it to the world without being berated, quilted, shamed, etc. Do yourself a favor and just block the lot of them.

The fact that he publicly and often blamed you and shamed you for an imagined deficit in your body because *nothing* could possibly be *his fault* is his fault. The fact that he is so wrapped up in other people knowing how his balls work is his fault. There is no part of his and his mother\u2019s (Jesus Christ) discomfort and shame that is your fault, your problem, or your responsibility. There is no way that you could soften that blow even if you wanted to.\n\nYou are more concerned about his feelings than his behavior merits.

First of all, congratulations on your pregnancy! \n\nYour ex husband and his family constantly berated you when they thought it was your \u2018fault\u2019 to the point where it derailed your entire relationship.
