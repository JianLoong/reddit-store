The fact that he publicly and often blamed you and shamed you for an imagined deficit in your body because *nothing* could possibly be *his fault* is his fault. The fact that he is so wrapped up in other people knowing how his balls work is his fault.

He waited until after we were married to tell me that I was genetically inferior to bear his children. Meanwhile, his genetics were so excellent that they needed to be spread around, so he wanted a kid with a Black woman, a Latina, and Asian woman, and so on. (He didn\u2019t work much so who the hell was expected to pay child support? I finally realized he expected me to do that) Don\u2019t get me wrong, he was pretty and intelligent, he was also a spoiled asshole narcissist. He ditched me one day for a Latina friend of mine.   \n\n\nIt\u2019s been 17 years. I have an awesome 10 year old who is just so incredibly fun and my husband is such an incredible father. I could not possibly feel more blessed.   \n\n\nNeither my ex nor my former friend (his wife) can breed.
