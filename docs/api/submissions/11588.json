Your life choices are not under her control.  Set this boundary now and stay with it.  You will thank yourself later.

Your sister is in no way ready for the adult responsibility of marriage until she realizes she doesn't own everything and she doesn't always get her way. Your parents sound conflict averse and likely created this monster by always giving her her way growing up. That shit stops NOW. If she tosses you from her wedding, so what? You will have dodged an entire day dedicated to her grandiose sense of self-importance. It's not a big loss, in my opinion.", "Can you pass on a message to your sister from me.

Is she serious?", "NTA.\n\nYou and your boyfriend did nothing wrong. I think you were accurate in your assessment of your sister and I'm disappointed your parents didn't back you up. It's nice that your boyfriend is willing adjust plans to keep the peace. Part of me wants to suggest that you agree but only after she books and pays for her destination. That way she can't suddenly claim that the next place you consider was where she actually wanted to go.", "NTA. Your sister doesnt own a location like that. \n\nIf shes that worried, tell her you wont share any details or photos until after she goes. But even then thats a bit too generous. \n\nYour sister has a serious case of thinking the world revolves around hef just because shes getting married. Call her bluff and let her remove you. Then when people ask where you are/were, you can tell them the truth and laugh along with them at her idiocy.", "NTA, based on your comment it sounds like you\u2019re going to get kicked out of the wedding for the hair thing too, so you might as well have the vacation you want. \n\nIt\u2019s not worth making yourself unhappy to please someone with impossible expectations.", "NTA. \n\nWhat kind of ridiculous entitlement to a destination.", "How is you going to an island making it less special for her? She doesn\u2019t own the island lol NTA and my advice is to not ask your bf to change anything. He did something sweet. Don\u2019t ruin it for a ridiculous reason.", "NTA - No one knew about her plans, it was just a coincidence. Also, what part of you and your bf going takes the specialness out the place?", "NTA. Lol go on your trip, she is being so ridiculous. Which island are you going to??", "NTA. Her and her wedding can eff right off then. The level of entitlement. She is TA and so are your parents for enabling her bs.", "NTA - I\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s pretty much no advice for this situation where you can come out unscathed.
