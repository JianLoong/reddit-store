The issue arose because my boyfriend planned an anniversary getaway to a tropical island that happens to be where my sister planned to honeymoon. \n\nI had no idea that she was planning to go there (they hadn't actually booked anything, she had just \"planned on it\"). And I didn't know until I shared the news with my family during a bi-weekly dinner we have together. \n\nAdditionally, this was a surprise trip planned and paid for by my boyfriend who would absolutely have no way of knowing my sister's plans (he's not close with her or her fianc\u00e9). \n\nShe says that if I go there first, I'll take away the surprise and specialness of the destination, and is insisting that I cancel or change the destination. I'm pretty upset and called her entitled because there's no way I'm going to tell my boyfriend to change something very nice he did for me! \n\nMy sister is now threatening to remove me from the wedding if I don't change my vacation, and my parents are begging me to give in to keep the peace. \n\nMy boyfriend has offered to pick a new location because he hates seeing me upset and fighting with family, so I wonder if I'm being the AH for being so stubborn about it all.", "created_utc": 1678070467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jlzsq/aita_for_vacationing_at_my_sisters_dream/", "score": 151, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your life choices are not under her control.  Set this boundary now and stay with it.  You will thank yourself later.

Your sister is in no way ready for the adult responsibility of marriage until she realizes she doesn't own everything and she doesn't always get her way. Your parents sound conflict averse and likely created this monster by always giving her her way growing up. That shit stops NOW. If she tosses you from her wedding, so what?

Is she serious?", "NTA.\n\nYou and your boyfriend did nothing wrong. I think you were accurate in your assessment of your sister and I'm disappointed your parents didn't back you up. It's nice that your boyfriend is willing adjust plans to keep the peace. Part of me wants to suggest that you agree but only after she books and pays for her destination. That way she can't suddenly claim that the next place you consider was where she actually wanted to go.", "NTA. Your sister doesnt own a location like that. \n\nIf shes that worried, tell her you wont share any details or photos until after she goes. But even then thats a bit too generous. \n\nYour sister has a serious case of thinking the world revolves around hef just because shes getting married. Call her bluff and let her remove you. Then when people ask where you are/were, you can tell them the truth and laugh along with them at her idiocy.", "NTA, based on your comment it sounds like you\u2019re going to get kicked out of the wedding for the hair thing too, so you might as well have the vacation you want. \n\nIt\u2019s not worth making yourself unhappy to please someone with impossible expectations.", "NTA. \n\nWhat kind of ridiculous entitlement to a destination.", "How is you going to an island making it less special for her? She doesn\u2019t own the island lol NTA and my advice is to not ask your bf to change anything. He did something sweet.

I haven't even had *that* conversation with her yet \ud83d\ude2d", "i wonder if there is a grade below bridezilla, because this somehow feels worse then that", "More than that, sister is giving golden child vibes and can\u2019t seem to stand that OP will happen to have vacationed in the same place before.", "X 10.", "That woman is gonna be so mad when she goes on her honeymoon and realizes people have been living there for years without consulting her!", "Unless it\u2019s a deserted island others have gone there first", "Honolulu, Hawaii. I'm so grateful and excited to go with my boyfriend, so no offense to him, but it's not even that crazy of a destination. We live in California \ud83d\ude2d", "Unless it\u2019s a deserted island I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t be the \u2018first\u2019 person to have ever gone there.", "Her sister wants to go and come back and be able to talk about it and have everyone hanging off of every word. She\u2019s worried they won\u2019t be doing that  if they\u2019ve already heard the stories about the location.", "At least OP won\u2019t have to alter her hair color for the wedding if she is uninvited.", "This. I assume your sister has spent a lifetime learning that if she is a sufficient PITA for a sufficient amount of time, everyone eventually gives in just to shut her up.

Do not buckle under even a little.", "bi-weekly can actually mean every two weeks or twice a week. i have never heard anyone use fortnightly in regular conversation lol.", "How did you get that from this post?", "To hell with that. She needs to get over herself. Is she going to ask every other brunette to dye their hair too? I feel bad for your sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9.", "Well if she kicks you out of the wedding for going on the vacation, you won't have to dye your hair.

That is absolutely insane.", "I\u2019m sorry to tell you this but\u2026 your sister is insane. And why in the world are your folks enabling her behaviour?? \n\nIf she\u2019s old enough to get married, how doesn\u2019t she realize how insane she sounds at her big age?!!?  What kind of fuckery???\n\nI want to go to heaven when I die, am I going to tell other people not die because I want to get there first?!? \n\nNah Nah Nah Nah Nah! Say no to All of it!", "Sweetheart this is not normal. She\u2019s trying to control everything about you, she can\u2019t dictate what you do with your hair or any aspect of your life.

Then plaster it all over Instagram and brag about it straight through to the reception.\n\nTo be clear, I normally wouldn\u2019t advocate for fanning the flames. But not only is she controlling, but she\u2019s doing it not so that SHE can enjoy the destination, but simply for optics. And because she\u2019s vain and superficial and entitled, such behaviour should be rewarded accordingly. \n\nAnd your parents need to see this post and the comments here.  They are treating the symptoms, not the disease. My sister was like this and so were my parents.  It got so bad that I called them out on their emotional blackmail (pleading to me to put up and shut up because they knew I would listen more than her) and told them if they continued I would stop speaking with them. It seems to be the same with your parents, and it\u2019s not fair and it\u2019s just not right. And letting it go on will just basically live the goal post and allow her to continue her tantrums.

Tell your sister AND your mother that she doesn\u2019t own it. Honestly what is wrong with people. )", "Oh wow, I was at least expecting it to be a place that's less common as a vacation/honeymoon destination. NTA!", "I really want you to poll the hundreds of wedding guests to see how many have been there before lol", "WTF.  Boy is she going to be upset that people vacation and even, gasp, honeymoon there all the time.   That will really ruin her just for her special trip.   Was she always this intolerable and entitled growing up?", "No kidding, I was literally just today working on plans for our Oahu and Maui vacation next year. I know a lot of people who have been to Hawaii. I\u2019ve never been, but my husband has had 2 work trips there. A lot of people who live in Hawaii are legitimately upset about overtourism there. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a wonderful and special place for a honeymoon, but on what planet does she think she\u2018s going to be the first and that it will be just hers?", "For real. I can tell who is the favorite child in that family", "TIL that it means both.\n\nAnd so very NTA... bring the entitlement and the parental enabling to an end and enjoy your trip!"]}
