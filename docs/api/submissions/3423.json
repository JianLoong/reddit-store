The flight was 3.5 hours long but was delayed for 2 hours initially and we had been waiting at the airport for very long time. My husband loves the window seat and I prefer the aisle, neither of us like the middle and we don\u2019t take it. So we book one aisle and one window in the same row and leave the middle seat for grabs. We don\u2019t mind people sitting between us so we are cool. This time we have a woman in her mid thirties board the plane with her maybe 6-ish yo kid. The kid was sat in the middle seat of the row in front of us and the woman between us. We greeted and smiled and before the plane started my husband asked if I could grab his headphones from the cabin luggage which I did. The woman realised that we were together and asked if I wanted to switch the seats with her to which I responded no and said that I like aisle and he likes window so we were fine. She was visibly sulking but we ignored and carried on. Now, the flight starts to take off and her kid started squealing and screaming with joy like really excited and the guys sitting with the kid got annoyed but asked him to calm down. The mom saw this and asked if it\u2019s ok for me to move to his middle seat so she could sit with the kid and take my aisle, I politely denied and said the kid looks under control now. Then she started screaming at my husband said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you don\u2019t have kids because your wife definitely doesn\u2019t know how to be a mom and what it takes. She doesn\u2019t know how hard it is to be away from the kid and can\u2019t help him. She doesn\u2019t even care that you guys are sitting apart. But I think you can do the wise thing and switch with me.\u201d To which my husband calmly said, \u201cif we were travelling with kids we would have made sure to book our seats in advance together which doesn\u2019t look like you did.\u201d She got mad and asked for the crew. The crew came in and we told them everything. The flight was full the cabin crew couldn\u2019t help and the whole flight she tried to elongate her legs to our sides or crisscross her legs on the seat, took both the arm rests, snored and slept and poured water on me. While deboarding the flight she called me an AH and said people like me shouldn\u2019t be allowed to travel.
