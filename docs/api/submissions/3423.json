The flight was 3.5 hours long but was delayed for 2 hours initially and we had been waiting at the airport for very long time. My husband loves the window seat and I prefer the aisle, neither of us like the middle and we don\u2019t take it. So we book one aisle and one window in the same row and leave the middle seat for grabs. We don\u2019t mind people sitting between us so we are cool. This time we have a woman in her mid thirties board the plane with her maybe 6-ish yo kid. The kid was sat in the middle seat of the row in front of us and the woman between us. We greeted and smiled and before the plane started my husband asked if I could grab his headphones from the cabin luggage which I did. The woman realised that we were together and asked if I wanted to switch the seats with her to which I responded no and said that I like aisle and he likes window so we were fine. She was visibly sulking but we ignored and carried on. Now, the flight starts to take off and her kid started squealing and screaming with joy like really excited and the guys sitting with the kid got annoyed but asked him to calm down. The mom saw this and asked if it\u2019s ok for me to move to his middle seat so she could sit with the kid and take my aisle, I politely denied and said the kid looks under control now. Then she started screaming at my husband said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you don\u2019t have kids because your wife definitely doesn\u2019t know how to be a mom and what it takes. She doesn\u2019t know how hard it is to be away from the kid and can\u2019t help him. She doesn\u2019t even care that you guys are sitting apart. But I think you can do the wise thing and switch with me.\u201d To which my husband calmly said, \u201cif we were travelling with kids we would have made sure to book our seats in advance together which doesn\u2019t look like you did.\u201d She got mad and asked for the crew. The crew came in and we told them everything. The flight was full the cabin crew couldn\u2019t help and the whole flight she tried to elongate her legs to our sides or crisscross her legs on the seat, took both the arm rests, snored and slept and poured water on me. While deboarding the flight she called me an AH and said people like me shouldn\u2019t be allowed to travel.

It was only a 3 hour flight and it's her own fault for not making sure to book a seat with her kid in advance. Also, she couldn't use getting to her kid as an excuse when she tried to switch seats with your husband who was sitting in the window.", "NTA. It would have a lot more sense for her to ask the people next to her child if she could swap. People don\u2019t want to sit beside unattended children. But even then they gave the right to refuse.", "Info: Did she ask the people next to her kid to move? And if so, what did they say?", "NTA\n\nThis was not about the kid.\n\nShe tried to guilt you into changing your seat, so she'd get the more comfortable aisle seat and have her kid in the middle.\n\nBut you had already declined this and the child was quiet. \n\nIt's also remarkable that she only asked you as another woman and didn't ask they men who actually sat with her child. Why didn't she ask one of them?\n\nProbably because she already knew that no one would willingly do it but banking on you caving out of womanly loyalty or some other nonsense.", "NTA. She wasn\u2019t the A for asking but after being told \u201cno\u201d she was extremely rude.", "NTA\n\nNo one is ever an asshole for sitting in their seats that they BOUGHT.  Your husband was correct, if she wanted to sit with her child, she should've pre-booked the flights.", "NTA. What an entitled piece of work that woman is. As if you\u2019re somehow responsible for her and her son being separated. She should have planned ahead and her failure to do so isn\u2019t your problem. She stuffed up and tried to make you feel guilty, so I think she\u2019s a complete A. Good on you for standing your ground.\n\nedit: typo", "NTA. People have the right to not give up their seats on a plane, especially with the way airlines nickel and dime people these days. It\u2019s also not fair to make your inability to plan ahead or unwillingness to pay a bit more to sit with your child everyone else\u2019s problem. It\u2019s fine to ask, but people need to respect a \u201cno\u201d and move on with their lives.", "NTA, that woman should have ensured she was seated next to her child. Yes, it may cost extra but she is a shitty mother and entitled enough to just assume people would switch seats.", "NTA. Mom rolled the dice on late booking and lost. Mom should have been razor-focused on her kid, because they could have been next to a creeper, instead of punishing you for standing your ground. However, the airline has the technology to know when a 6 year old is being seated separately and could disallow or up-charge this practice if they choose.  Hopefully enough of these situations occur to get them to make changes.", "NTA you should feel good that your free will caused this woman to seethe so hard.", "NTA - your husband was right- if she wanted to make sure her and her son got seats together she should have planned advance instead of trying to intimidate someone to move their seat. Your husband flipped the script on her and she didn\u2019t like it.", "NTA this is a flight where you choose your seats (and may pay more for certain positions). She gambled and lost.", "NTA - No one is an AH for not switching seats on an airplane.  It's okay if people ask, but they get so offended when you decline.\n\nI reluctantly switched seats with someone once, we both has aisle seats, his wife was in a center seat, so I was the person between them. I didn't want to switch but since it was aisle for aisle it seemed okay. I said, \"as long as the media works in your seat, I'll switch\". The flight took off, the media didn't work in my new seat. I tried getting assistance but it was broken. I told them I had to switch back and they retaliated by handing things to each other, over me, for the rest of the 6-hour flight. At least I had a movie so I didn't have to hear them.", "NTA I would have paid the exorbitant cost for red wine and poured it on her lap.          \nY'know turbulence.", "NTA", "[removed]", "NTA", "NTA!!!!!   People are free to politely ask once if you will trade seats, but you are never, and I mean NEVER obligated to do so, ESPECIALLY if the trade is a downgrade.

How sad that her 6 year old was better behaved than she was for the flight.", "NTA \n\n\"Your failure to plan does not mean an emergency on my part.\"\n\nShe behaved like an entitled child. Maybe she should have spent the extra money for assigned seats. Maybe she should have made her reservation on a plane that had seats together, instead of assuming people would switch seats with her. There's a reason why middle seats are undesirable.", "NTA. I personally might have though about offering her my seat- unil she insulted me. People need to learn to take \"no\" for an answer.", "NTA. I have a bad leg. It's not disabling, but flying hurts sometimes. I finally learned that windows/middle seats just mean I have next to no chance of stretching my leg, which helps. So, I pay extra for either aisle or bulkhead.\n\nWhen booking a flight, if you don't choose to pick your seats (whether by necessity bc the flight is full or by cheapness), you are risking not sitting together. You don't know why other people picked their seats, so it's a risk that someone isn't just going to roll over and switch. \n\nKnowing that aisle, window, and bulkheads usually cost more than middles, she could have at least offered to pay you a little. Or she could have asked the other side to switch. But it was still a gamble she took that didn't pay off.", "NTA, mainly because swapping seats with you wouldn\u2019t, by itself, have solved the problem of wanting to be closer to her kid so she could keep him calm. Whether your seating preferences (one aisle, one window on a three seat row) could be considered inconsiderate in general would depend on how you behaved during the flight - for instance, if I was to find myself sat between you then you damn sure wouldn\u2019t be passing things back and forth across me during the flight.", "NTA your husband is my hero for that line\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Nta-", "NTA, because her behaviour was clearly disgusting. But I have to admit, you guys are clearly a little bit dickish.\n\nThe kid's six, FFS. Somebody needed to budge to find a solution - whether it was you, the people next to the kid, or your husband. \n\nFlights get booked up fast, sometimes you need to scramble for a last-minute seat and families get split.
