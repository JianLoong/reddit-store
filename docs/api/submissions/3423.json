The flight was 3.5 hours long but was delayed for 2 hours initially and we had been waiting at the airport for very long time. My husband loves the window seat and I prefer the aisle, neither of us like the middle and we don\u2019t take it. So we book one aisle and one window in the same row and leave the middle seat for grabs. We don\u2019t mind people sitting between us so we are cool. This time we have a woman in her mid thirties board the plane with her maybe 6-ish yo kid. The kid was sat in the middle seat of the row in front of us and the woman between us. We greeted and smiled and before the plane started my husband asked if I could grab his headphones from the cabin luggage which I did. The woman realised that we were together and asked if I wanted to switch the seats with her to which I responded no and said that I like aisle and he likes window so we were fine. She was visibly sulking but we ignored and carried on. Now, the flight starts to take off and her kid started squealing and screaming with joy like really excited and the guys sitting with the kid got annoyed but asked him to calm down. The mom saw this and asked if it\u2019s ok for me to move to his middle seat so she could sit with the kid and take my aisle, I politely denied and said the kid looks under control now. Then she started screaming at my husband said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you don\u2019t have kids because your wife definitely doesn\u2019t know how to be a mom and what it takes. She doesn\u2019t know how hard it is to be away from the kid and can\u2019t help him. She doesn\u2019t even care that you guys are sitting apart. But I think you can do the wise thing and switch with me.\u201d To which my husband calmly said, \u201cif we were travelling with kids we would have made sure to book our seats in advance together which doesn\u2019t look like you did.\u201d She got mad and asked for the crew. The crew came in and we told them everything. The flight was full the cabin crew couldn\u2019t help and the whole flight she tried to elongate her legs to our sides or crisscross her legs on the seat, took both the arm rests, snored and slept and poured water on me. While deboarding the flight she called me an AH and said people like me shouldn\u2019t be allowed to travel.

(in my case it was just that Kid 1 had a mild preference and \"wouldn't it be nice\"). For the nonparents, no one ever knows if we have legit reasons for not watching to switch--it's just assumed we dont' have one other than selfishness.", "She was so worried about wanting to be right next to her 6-year-old to supervise and be that involved mom she thought you could never be \u2026 that she \u2026 \u201cslept and snored\u201d on the flight?", " NTA. But she is still owed the two armrests.  I still feel sorry for the people sitting with the kid.", "NTA. But it should be mentioned that the standard rules of access are that the window gets the view, the aisle gets the access and the middle gets the armrests. Again, definitely NTA, but the armrests were rightfully hers.", "NTA, but the part about her taking both arm rests...by recognized social rules of airplane flight, the middle seat GETS BOTH ARMRESTS, because the window has the wall to lean on, and the aisle has extra leg room. So you're NTA for not wanting to switch seats, but you are assholish for complaining that she used both armrests.", "That's what I read the first time the woman asked, but the second time she was asking OP to switch seats with the kid, so the woman and her son could sit together. I also read it as the offending woman asking OP's husband to switch with the kid as well. This would have given her either the aisle or window seat with the kid in the middle, and OP or their husband would be banished to a middle seat in the other row.", "NTA she should have gotten a seat with her child", "As a traveller I don't gaf if people want to trade. I will always say no for almost 99.9% those who asks typically ask in entitled and demanding way.  NTA she should've made arrangements to have herself/her kid to be seated together. I know for I always set for myself to be in a window seat", "NTA.  i hate disorganized entitled parents who believe because they have a child that rules dont apply... or that everyone has to change their plans.\n\n\nShe and her child sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA. \n\nI had a similar situation happen a while back. Though not with kids.  \n\nMy husband and I was going to see a movie. This was before the assigned seats in the theatre. I made him leave early so we could get there early. I like to walk around and pick my seat, before everyone gets there. \n\nOf course after we're seated, the theatre starts to fill up. When the previews started more people started coming in. There was an empty seat on either side of my husband and me. Of course two people come up to me and ask if I could move down one seat. \n\nI declined. I may be the AH for it, but I prepared and they didn't.  \n\nSame thing here.", "Flight attendant here.  You don't have to relinquish your selected seat for anybody if you don't want to, it's yours.  She was TA in everything she did and said except one.  It's the unwritten rule of the skies that the person sandwiched into the middle seat gets the armrests.  The aisle and window people can lean away, the middle person is just stuck there, unable to move.  Give them the armrest, though maybe not this woman.  She was awful.", "Come on she didn't do it by mistake she didn't even bother picking up the bottle and she certainly didn't apologize to you. I'm sure that could be a considered assault or battery I can't remember which."]}
