Her brother and his wife, and their three adult kids. It all started when my grandmother died. My uncle's wife asked my grandfather immediately after my grandmother died if she could go into her jewelry boxes and take a few items. He agreed and she wiped everything except costume jewelry out. My Mom was left with nothing except junk from her own mother's possessions.\n\nTo keep peace she let it go.\n\nWhen my grandfather became I'll and passed his house and everything in it was to be split 50/50. Between my mom and her brother. My uncle took nearly everything from the house and left my Mom again with junk immediately after he died. Even things she'd bought for my grandfather had vanished. Lawnmower, weed whacker, clothes, small electronics, all gone and my uncle just refused to acknowledge he'd taken Everything.\n\nDuring the house sale he ignored all her suggestions on how to improve house and sell for a higher price. He also mived his kids in there as renters for about two years, basically rent free, as long as they kept the house beat and tidy until sale  until it sold.\n\nMy cousin's wrecked the place. They painted basically Everything left in there black. Never cleaned, never took out trash, were disrespectful and disruptive to neighbors, etc. was a nightmare and we had to do monthly upkeep on the exterior because they did nothing.\n\nWhen the house finally sold years later for way less than was originally valued, my Mom cut him and his fam out of our lives. She's getting frail now and is talking about her death and funeral arrangements. She wants that section of her family banned from her funeral. Banned from the viewing and family dinner after.\n\nI agree, they've been terrible to her for over a decade now, and she just wants close family/friends there I absolutely agree, but have been told by friends that it's a dick move to ban them entirety from everything when she passes.\n\nAITA for following her wishes that I make the funeral director make sure they aren't allowed to be there at all for the funeral?", "created_utc": 1703154249, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18njx5y/aita_for_banning_estranged_family_from_moms/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I believe in honouring last wishes and your mother seems very clear about how she feels and what she wants. Your Uncle and Aunt don\u2019t have a good track record when it comes to these matters.

Your uncle and aunt might only come to get some stuff of her as well as from their parents. Don't invite them. At least not for the viewing nor the family dinner.

Your mother did well cutting them off (I also live in a family where quite a lot of cuts happened) because it's really the only way. If you don't, they will cyclically come back and ask for stuff or demand that you do something for them. \n\nAbsolutely follow her wish and tell the funeral director to make sure they can't get into the funeral.

My mom was estranged from her brother for over 20 years and when she died my dad (who hadn't been married to her for over a decade at that point) invited him to her funeral against her wishes as well as mine and my brothers wishes because \"funerals are for the living not the dead.\" His presence there made it way worse than it should have been because I spent the entire service thinking about how upset she'd be rather than honouring her memory. I really wish I'd been firmer in saying no.", "NTA. First, it's her funeral and she's the only one who should have a say (and tell friends it's very concerning they won't respect a dead relative's wish). Second, these acts deserves to be addressed.

No details to be given out to the public or anyone else.   \nThe funeral parlour puts a person on the door confirming attendees, checking ID.  \nA neighbour or friend sits in your home on the day of the funeral and makes sure it stays intact.   \n\n\nTell your uncle AFTER its done that it\u2019s happened.", "NTA.

My brother and I kept a great relationship with our Aunt, no BS like your cousins perpetrated. Our Dad was a total AH to our Aunt repeatedly through our lives and she was a very forgiving person until the last time and she just wasn\u2019t going to do it again. When she passed, I asked my cousin if he\u2019d like me to break the news to our Dad and he shared her wishes with me- not only was he not to come, but she didn\u2019t even want him to know she had died. My brother and I 100% respected her wishes and I support you doing the same. My brother and I have been NC with our Dad for years, but you better believe we heard from him when he did find out. As usual, we are the worst sons in the world, everything Is our fault, the usual not accepting personal responsibility. I mention this to prepare you for the blowback. Other family members were on the fence, not liking what we did, but also understanding that we were respectful of our Aunt\u2019s and cousin\u2019s wishes.
