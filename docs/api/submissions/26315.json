{"id": 26315, "submission_id": "16bdz5i", "title": "AITA for suggesting my SIL should embrace not being my nephew's mom?", "selftext": "I (28f) am very close to my nephew Matteo (10m). He's my brother Mark's (36m) son. Matteo's mom died 5 years ago. Her death was very sudden and Matteo had a lot of trouble afterward. He was born with a heart condition and Matteo's mom was the one who did most of the day to day caring for him and was normally the one to stay with him during hospitalizations. Though Mark did stay with him when he could.\n\nTwo years after Mark lost his first wife he met Fiona (35f). They got married two years ago. Matteo struggled with Mark remarrying. He was already in therapy so Mark mentioned to the therapist that Matteo was having a hard time seeing it as not replacing his mom but moving forward and wanted the therapist to help Matteo.\n\nAt the start it appeared to me that Mark just wanted Matteo to give Fiona a chance to be more than just some stranger. But after three or four months of marriage I noticed there was a narrative shift and I would hear Mark and Fiona say that Matteo was not embracing the idea of having two mom's. Fiona mentioned that they still had photos of Matteo's mom up and she would try to ask Matteo about his mom but he would shut her out and was not willing to speak to her about his mom.\n\nI know from both Mark and Fiona that they have suggested Matteo could give Fiona a mom nickname to distinguish her from his mom and Matteo said no. Matteo has said he doesn't want two mom's and he doesn't like that Fiona tried to do the things his mom did, especially taking him to medical appointments. Seems they had Fiona try once but Matteo wanted to go in alone, etc and after that Mark took the time off work to go.\n\nLately, they have talked about how Matteo doesn't give Fiona a card for Mother's Day and how he had said in a family therapy session that he never wants Fiona to be his second mom and he doesn't want anyone to be his second mom. Fiona was very upset. She was telling me about it and wondering if I knew stuff since my nephew talks to me.\n\nI suggested that Fiona should learn to embrace not being Matteo's mom and find the fun and caring relationship they could have if she decides to accept his boundary and figure out what they could be. I explained that of my friends who had stepparents the ones who truly loved and cared about their stepparent had less of a parent child dynamic and more of that of a trusted adult/confidant. Fiona went from upset to angry in seconds and told me she can't be less than a parent figure to him when he's a young kid and will likely grow up to resent her if she denies him the chance to have another mom figure.\n\nAfter that conversation she sent a string of DMs saying she was really offended I wanted to minimize her role in his life.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693986493, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16bdz5i/aita_for_suggesting_my_sil_should_embrace_not/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is the correct advice and you\u2019ve just dented her ego because as a woman l, she thinks that\u2019s her role in the dynamic. \nI refused to accept either my dads new wife or my mum\u2019s husband as anything but that. THEY chose them. I had no choice in the matter. I have one dad. One mum. And they went on to pick further spouses that I hated. My dad once drunkenly referred to his wife as my mother and I haven\u2019t spoken to him since. I am 34. If that can still affect me like that, imagine how this poor boy whose mother died is trying to manage. \nShe just needs time to adjust to your suggestion. You are right.", "NTA. You offered a sensible perspective. Fiona needs to understand that relationships with stepchildren can be unique and valuable without trying to replace a parent.", "NTA. Sounds like you're the only adult willing to let this child grieve at his own pace. Overbearing step parents are popular fairy tale villains for a reason", "Nta.  Dont marry people with kids, never works out. Or if it does only a small percentage.", "NTA. You gave great advice, the problem is that she doesn't want to work this out, she wants a specific outcome. I was going to say that at least she isn't trying to erase his dead mom, but given the circumstances it feels like a ruse now.", "i do find it funny that she was wondering if you \u201cknew stuff\u201d. was she looking for blackmail? matteo\u2019s been more than clear, at this point she\u2019s being unkind. i think you told her the exact truth she didn\u2019t want to hear, because she cares more about being a mom than she does about the child she wants to be a mom to. and as for the dm\u2019s; you don\u2019t want to minimize her role in his life, matteo does. or to be more accurate, he wants her to see what he wants her role to be, and you\u2019re just backing him up. nta.", "NTA\n\nMatteo's needs haven't been a factor in his dad's \"moving on\" after the death of his mom. Marrying after only a year of dating seems fast to me. Your brother and his wife are looking forward in a new life stage, their married life. Matteo hasn't split his life into chapters the same way. His grieving process is unique to him. There is no set timeline about how children grieve nor what order related issues should be \"gotten over.\"\n\nIt seems like Matteo's perspective and very valid feelings aren't being considered when they vary from his dad's process. Dad may feel fully supported in his new marriage, as in second wife has fully filled his requirements as a life partner. That has nothing to do with Matteo's experience. \n\nMatteo may feel his continuing grieving for his mom is now not allowed. The adults on his home are invalidating- and now treating as an offense and insult- his normal feelings of grief and loss for his mom. A new woman in the picture doesn't erase Matteo's reality of having lost his mom. The attempted erasure and replacement of his mother's place in his life and heart is cruel. It requires a 10 year old to repress and deny the greatest loss and trauma of his life. Because it hurts stepmom's feelings that this child doesn't see her as a complete and sufficient replacement for his dead mom.\n\nSIL could let Matteo be himself and acknowledge and sympathize with his grief over his mom's passing. She could create her own space in his life as a fully accepting supportive adult. Requiring fully occupying the \"mom space\" in his life demonstrated by erasing and replacing his dead mom with SIL is self centered, selfish, invalidating and cruel to the most vulnerable person in this situation.", "YTA\n\n\nYes this is an incredibly hard situation for the kid to be in and while mark and Fiona aren't doing the best job cause I think forcing your way in after such a short time is a bit bizzare but the way you worded it is so bad. Imagine if someone says the exact same sentence to you, how'd you feel? Not upset and angry?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Kids are more likely to call a step parent mom or dad if they're allowed to come to that in their own time. Forcing it just makes it painful for everyone involved.", "NTA he is old enough to know what he wants.", "NTA  Fiona's gonna FAFO!", "I'm sorry you had that experience. One of my friends' mom would always call her third husband my friend's dad when she wanted to act like her ex was some awful person instead of the guy who wouldn't support her and husband #2 who was the affair partner. It bothered my friend to the core and she eventually stopped speaking to her mom as well.", "Yes, and I know she says it's not replacing but adding.

I appreciate your kindness. Having that outsider knowledge means you do have a little nugget of insight that she doesn\u2019t have. She will come around. Express to her that you were giving her your advice from the most sincere, genuine of places and that she doesn\u2019t have to take it. And it will pass. She will remember it. If she\u2019s lucky, she\u2019ll implement it. A trusted adult and confident/friend is likely the best she can have. He\u2019s too old for a mother replacement. You came from absolutely the right place for your nephew.", "Given how volatile Fiona was to your kind suggestions, I totally understand why Matteo has been so resistant to Fiona. If she\u2019s THAT reactive to someone she views as an equal and who she approached for advice, imagine how she reacts towards a child who is not responding in the way she is demanding.\n\nShe\u2019s not thinking about Matteo and what is best for him or respecting him as a person\u2026she\u2019s only concerned about herself and what she wants.
