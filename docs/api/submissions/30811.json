I ask him why he\u2019s staying down there if he doesn\u2019t have anything with him, and he proceeds to tell me he has a jacket in his truck to wear hunting. I make the comment that it\u2019s weird because he never has slept there before  but ok, let me know if he decides to come home. We\u2019re only a 10-15 minute drive to deer camp. When I arrived home all of his necessary belongings were gone and I realized he had already packed a bag and had made the decision to stay overnight  before ever discussing it.

He says I\u2019m the asshole because he doesn\u2019t have to ask me for permission to stay over night anywhere- which is true- he doesn\u2019t.

You said \"it should be a mutual decision if overnight trips will be taken.\" That's not right. Sometimes people just need some space and alone time in a marriage. He shouldn't need to ask your permission before camping overnight. \n\nAnd did he explicitly tell you that he didn't pack ahead of time, or did you just assume that when he told you he had his jacket he meant he didn't have anything else? And just because he packed a bag didn't mean he was going to use it.

Yes he does have to ask permission.

You sleep in our bed unless otherwise discussed.", "Nta. No permission is not required, but committed partners discuss and communicate what they are doing and where they are going. It's a matter of respect. Your husband is being shady as fuck. Why would he plan to sleep in the truck rather than drive 15minutes to go home to his own bed. Especially to have a childfree night with the wife.

The reasons he would be sneaky about it are mostly not good ones, unless he feels you wouldn't let him go ever if he ran it by you first.", "This was my first thought as well. The only other explanation I came up with is - is it possible that her husband called OP to say he would sleep there, she mentioned that he only has a jacket and no other necessities, and he then decided after hanging up to drive back the 10-15 min, pack an overnight bag, and then head back to deer camp before she got home? Otherwise it makes no sense why he didn\u2019t just mention he\u2019d already packed his stuff during their initial conversation", "While you may not be mistaken I feel a gentler way of putting it might have been kinder to OP. This reads a bit snarky intended or not.", "The reason's name is Mandy, she's a cocktail waitress at the deer camp bar, she's 23, blonde and dumb as a rock.", "Yes this.

Someone comment under me so I can find this again for the update", "What's crazy to me is that the small lies are so poorly covered up and thought out that it honestly makes everything more suspicious. He was clearly planning on doing this for at least a little bit, and that was the best explanation he could think of? He's pretty much asking to get caught", "Good plan - don't drive down there, guns blazing, to check up on him.

He didn\u2019t need her to pack a bag, she would like a heads up he was potentially planning to stay out all night is all which is normal and expected in healthy relationships \u2026but again, he lied about it instead.", "I would SO be heading out to deer camp! But I don't think OP would find him there, sadly......", "Nah, not as defensive as he got. He'd packed already.", "NTA Op. Thats shady af", "He\u2019s definitely an amateur, that\u2019s for sure. The OP can take solace in that, at least.", "So who is he cheating on you with? Did you find out? Don't tell him or confront him, just save the evidence.", "When you have young children, it is important to discuss those details ahead of time.\n\nIt\u2019s not asking permission - it\u2019s common courtesy.\n\nBoth parents can\u2019t just do whatever they want without any discussion to avoid both parents making plans at the same time."]}
