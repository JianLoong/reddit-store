I suggested he enjoy the afternoon of freedom and go hangout with friends because we never get alone time.  About 15 minutes after I got off work my husband calls me to tell me he is sleeping at deer camp- but we don\u2019t have a camper, nor sleeping arrangements. I ask him why he\u2019s staying down there if he doesn\u2019t have anything with him, and he proceeds to tell me he has a jacket in his truck to wear hunting. I make the comment that it\u2019s weird because he never has slept there before  but ok, let me know if he decides to come home. We\u2019re only a 10-15 minute drive to deer camp. When I arrived home all of his necessary belongings were gone and I realized he had already packed a bag and had made the decision to stay overnight  before ever discussing it. So I call him upset that he had just told me he didn\u2019t pack anything and only had a jacket but clearly had packed bags before leaving that evening. He says I\u2019m the asshole because he doesn\u2019t have to ask me for permission to stay over night anywhere- which is true- he doesn\u2019t. But a simple conversation prior to him packing bags and making that decision would have been the respectful option. My viewpoint is- I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re 10 minutes away, 2 hours away or 6 hours away it should be a mutual decision if overnight trips will be taken not a one way street of \u201cI\u2019m leaving tonight and I\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\u201d I\u2019m also uncomfortable with the fact that he told me he packed a jacket but in reality had clothes and all necessary items packed as well.

You said \"it should be a mutual decision if overnight trips will be taken.\" That's not right. Sometimes people just need some space and alone time in a marriage. He shouldn't need to ask your permission before camping overnight. \n\nAnd did he explicitly tell you that he didn't pack ahead of time, or did you just assume that when he told you he had his jacket he meant he didn't have anything else? And just because he packed a bag didn't mean he was going to use it.
