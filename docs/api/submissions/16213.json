This may sound like a fair exchange of resources, but he has not, during that time, been able to make any investment of his own towards a personal dwelling; while your equity has continued to increase. He has been investing his money into you and your relationship, and while noble, your decision to leave your home to your sibling dismisses his role as your life partner in exchange for that of a tenant. You doubled down by getting cold feet about purchasing a home together.", "NTA. But what you are effectively telling your partner is that he has to move out of his domicile if you die.

My love dies and I\u2019m kicked out of my house - what a crappy year that would be.", "YTA.\n\nRegardless of how it came to be, your current partner allowed you to live rent free for three years which likely contributed to you being able to buy your current home. Unless you made it clear to him prior to moving in that because you agreed that he would pay for luxuries, you would hold it against him in the event of your death, I think it's shitty. It seems like he would have much preferred to contribute toward the bills and mortgage so that he wouldn't be kicked out of the home you shared and forced to make arrangements while grieving shortly after your death to allow your siblings to take possession of the property. \n\nI know some couples prefer to split bills and keep separate accounts, but you don't even want this person who is presumably someone you intend to spend your life since you are planning to buy another house with to get your pension like most other partners do. Maybe that's a thing too and I just don't know about it, but it just makes me sad that your partner may view you as his family when it's clear you don't feel the same way after 5 and a half years of commitment. It's good that you told him now so he can decide how he wants to move forward because this may be a dealbreaker or change his financial plans for the future.", "NTA. He's been living with you rent-free for 2 and a half years. He has a place to stay in the event something happens to you, and it sounds like he would still be rent-free.

You guys lived within your means; the house being your equity so you pay that, and he pays for food and other miscellaneous things. You have a home, a life, and a future being in your 30s.\n\nHere's where I think the situation goes into YTA. Your siblings have children so you will your house to them. Which logically means you shall will the house to all possible future children to keep things fair, and the house will be sold and divided up. This is your partner's home. You're operating under the assumption he can just go back and live in the family flat. But what if in 10 20 30 40 years, that's no longer an option. Also since you're not married and your assets would of probably gone to your siblings anyway, this sorta feels like this was done as a power play.\n\nIf I may, you can put a clause in your will.

Also just because he doesn\u2019t pay rent he does contribute. The direct money trail doesn\u2019t really count imo when the accounting is concerned. Also reading your comments it doesn\u2019t seem super clear on who was the one to present the relationship as marriage free.

If your partner isn't contributing to your mortgage and isn't on the deed of your house, and you aren't married, it's not unusual for your property to go to family. \n\nHowever, this was a common situation in same sex relationships in the past where the dead partner's family comes in and kicks the surviving partner out, leaving them with nothing/homeless. Your partner is getting your life insurance though and it sounds like he has/had his own place.\n\nIf you purchase a home with your partner, it would be weird to leave half of the joint property to your sibling rather than buy the place with joint tenancy with right of survivorship.

The problem we have is that I do not have the deposit fast enough that he has to forward on a house together. But the mortgage lender has given us more allowance for the future house based on my earnings than his.

And your bf a)doesn\u2019t like your home b) can\u2019t afford his dream house on his salary c) wants to buy a joint property., So your solution is for your BF to buy his own home. But how would that look? Would you both move into the same house? Rent one and that person gets the benefit of not having to pay as much /nothing/ earns money from the rental while one person pays all the bills for the current spot? You both live in separate houses?\n\nIt might be time your boyfriend start paying house bills. What ever that looks like but it\u2019s time. You live with him for free  ( doesn\u2019t matter that it was a family home, he could of still charge you rent) and he lived with you for free (might of been longer then the reverse). \n\nSit down lay out all financials and figure things out.

There are a ton of ways to make sure that the property stays with your family after you pass away while making sure that your boyfriend would still be able to live there in the case you two never do get a house together. A simple clause in your will that states your Boyfriend would be in control of the house as long as he maintains it until his death and then it is given to your family is fairly easy to write into any will. But again if you two do go and purchase a house together I do not feel like he would see this as a issue anymore, from your boyfriends point of view even if he doesn't like the house, even if he doesn't like the location, he still loves you. He wants to build a life together with you, build generational wealth with you, and over all just be together with you. The house you are currently staying in has sentimental value to him more so than any life insurance policy ever will, he has memories of you and him being together in the house, watching movies, cooking dinner, having date nights, all things that after you pass that have way more value that any monetary thing could possess. You are thinking very much about facts here and not inputting the fact of sentimental value. I would like to state again that IF you two do go and buy a house together then I believe all of this will be alleviated, but it should be something that you both talk to each other about, ask him why it bothers him so much that he wouldn't be getting the house, ask him if you put in your will that he could maintain control over it until he passes and then it would go to your family if that would be okay, there are a ton of things here to unpack but I think those would be making steps in the right direction.", "Thanks for putting it so elegantly. \n\nSometimes I feel I have to push to earn more because even in the house I have now he couldn't do the reverse for us. There's no way he could run a mortgage and pay for all of its expenses. His salary isn't enough.\n\nI don't think he quite understands what it's like to not make a mortgage or to go without for prioritising bills, he's never had to.\n\nThat is part of my fear that his family pulls the flat and then he is homeless I do not know how to broach the subject. Either way he is reliant on me for a home. Few people have mentioned luxuries that he contributes, again if I wasn't paying for a second Masters to earn more money, I could afford the luxuries. For editing they are also luxuries and not a common standard of living. It's a double edged sword.\n\nDigress will take a new sub if needed.

You\u2019re missing the sentimental aspect of it", "NAH - You dont owe him anything but try to understand how your partner feels after learning that he doesn't get to keep his home (I know he doesn't own the deed or makes payment, but he has been living here) after losing his partner. I think you are missing the sentimental value portion of the house. It may be a house to you, but it is a home to your partner. The place holds a lot of memories and emotional value to him. Why can't you set up the life insurance to your family and ensure that they have sufficient money to buy their own house? At the same time, your partner will be able to stay in the same house that he has been staying with all the memories.", "YTA. Your partner suffers the pain of losing his partner and then is made homeless. That's really cruel and suggests you have no love for him at all.", "NAH. If you see yourselves as life long partners it is a little weird to set him up to be evicted if you die. You see postings on ask a lawyer all the time \"how do I evict my elderly aunt's long term boyfriend now that she's died.\"\n\nI would flip your estate and leave him the house and your niece the life insurance.", "In your comment you mention he is leaving everything/most things to his family in the event of death. Also it sounds like he will have a roof over his head, regardless, in the case of you dying. Either his family home or he can buy a house with money (including your life insurance). If he didn\u2019t then I would vote the opposite. You are trying to be equitable between family members. \n\nMy father died and didn\u2019t have my mother in the will properly - he left most of the money to his adult children from his first marriage who are all older and financially better off than my mum (she was a SAHM). She would have been homeless and in poverty if we didn\u2019t go to court and demand she get adequate split of the relationship property - they were married for 40+ years. In the end she and us got the house and the half kids got a massive cash amount but she has no way to pay for the cost/maintenance of the house. We kids ended up forfeiting our \u201cinheritance\u201d in the Will to mum. I will be supporting mum financially for the rest of her life. \n\nMy sister is disabled and has 3 kids. A significant portion of my wealth will go to them, including 401k, life insurance, etc. My husband and I have discussed it and he is supportive of it. Any shared assets (like house, boat etc) will go to him. His family is much better off financially than mine & he also makes significantly more money than me or anyone in my family. \n\nIn your case NTA. I think leaving him money that is greater than the value of the house and knowing he has the ability to buy a house or have a roof over his head is key. \n\nYou may wish to put in your Will a period of time that your husband is able to stay in the house to allow him time to grieve and get his affairs in order.  They tried to evict my mum from the home immediately after the death and they would have legally been within their rights. My mum was bed bound from grief after the death for about 6 months so that would have been a disaster. I think knowing my dad left her destitute was probably part of it. My dad had millions in assets when he died.\n\nIf you jointly buy a house together then that needs to go to him.", "NTA. \n\nNot married,  no children together, life insurance you\u2019re leaving him is worth more than the house AND he\u2019s planning to leave everything he has to his own family?\n\nI would say plus he would have the house you guys are planning to purchase together, but I sense some hesitation around that. Are you sure this is the right relationship for you? \n\nDo what you feel is best.", "NTA he is NOT your husband he is your boyfriend. you do not owe him anything when you do even if you live together. even the law and courts say he would get nothing if you died without a will. the problem i see is that he expects a lot from you when you pass but is leaving nothing to you when he passes and doesnt' think thats a problem", "NTA. The house is your property to do with what you choose. He's not contributed towards the property in any meaningful way. Don't feel guilty about leaving your assessts to the people you want to leave them to.", "Not married = do what you like with your property. Leaving him the life insurance should be enough for the guy to find a new place to live.", "Your comments seem really stuck on the fact that you aren't married, do you not value the relationship that's multiple years long just because you aren't married? I think you need to reassess because you don't seem as invested in this relationship as him.", "If you two are moving towards owning this home/a home together (as you mentioned), you will likely hold it as joint tenants with rights of survivorship. In which case, you can put whatever you want in your will, but if the property is titled that way, your partner would own it in the event of your death.\n\nI would say YTA for attempting this without talking to your partner first/ considering their contribution to your collective life which has allowed you to invest in this home and build equity.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t married.  He is living for free really. Even with the difference in pay he can afford to stash away a good chunk of money since he pays nothing to living expenses.", "YTA.", "YWBTA\n\nMoney money money... Me, my and then proceed to talk down the time you lived rent free with him as if that doesn't count because of whatever reason instead of just seeing it as him letting you live there because he loves you but it had no financial value because you have excuses for that.. You lived there rent free for a majority of your relationship but that accounts for nothing?\n\nYou talk about your relationship as if it's a business, it's all about what he contributes financially to your five year long relationship and nothing else, does he make you happy? Does he do things for you? Does he have a right to be comfortable after you go and has he earned the right to retain the comforts of his current life that he shares with you should something go wrong? By the sounds no but by the sounds of you, you're ungrateful for what he has brought to the table as is, so do both of you a favour and call it off imo.\n\nIf I sat down and weighed up what my partner brings to our relationship by the way of finances without taking into account all of the little things, our lives together would seem pretty one sided as well but when taking into account all of the cooking, cleaning, looking after the house and me and above all, his TIME! His life! His youngest years spent with me than things begin to equal out because that's a the biggest investment, the happy years we've spent together, the non-refundable parts, he does a tonne more than money can do and if you can't leave your partner more than you feel that they've \"Earned\" financially than your relationship is worth less than the value that you seem to have already quoted it at.\n\nFrom what I see here, you've basically told him that you're leaving him what you think he's earned.. That's not love, you're not in love with him and that would be a pretty solid smack upside the face with a damp fish for anyone to swallow.", "YTA. Think about if the roles were reversed, would you be ok with that?", "NTA.

We aren't married, the house and bills are totally in my name and he is, in law, entitled to nothing unless I leave it to him. However, we've been together 20+ years, he's paid for major part of groceries, car and house repairs but usually via transfer to my account or cash and vet bills as well as fun spending. So he has contributed. At bare minimum, he's probably entitled to 25-33% of equity in house as would have struggled with income and outgoings without him. I'd expect, if you leave to sister, at minimum to ask her to buy him out at least a share of that so he has enough for downpayment on flat and somewhere to live.\n\nOP was happy to live rent-free with him to buildup her deposit for current home and take advantage of his family that way. Now she's allowing her family to take advantage of him too because he has no way of proving his financial contribution towards the relationship.

The household bills will be split equitably, but my future husband insists we do a 60/40 split with him paying the 60 because I'm coming into the relationship with more income and liquid assets.\n\nWhile we love one another and don't see a breakup in our future, we're both trying to be wise concerning what is fair in the worst case scenario.

It could be attachment", "why can't the house go to your partner and the life insurance go to your family?", "The money aspect isn't the problem, it's the fact you'd be effectively evicting him from your family home, it's the emotional and sentimental aspect I think is bad.", "Money doesn't fix the pain of moving out of the home you built with your partner. Sure they won't be homeless but it won't fix the additional heartbreak you're causing.  Your comments come across as emotionally detached in general.", "I got that, but that won\u2018t make the whole moving-out-while-grieving thing easier on him.", "I do see where you're coming from, but coming from a similar position myself (earning more, more assets to leave, etc etc) my conclusion about the financial side isn't the same because I've taken the longer-term practicalities into consideration. For example, I earn more, so I pay more towards everything. That's fair because it's split by percentages, not by bill, meaning we can maintain a joint lifestyle that is equal.\n\nAnd that carries on, I pay more into both our pensions, and upon my death I will leave significantly more to him than if it was the other way around! But practically speaking this also makes sense - if I died today, he would be in debt and homeless shortly afterwards unless I bequeathed everything to him; whereas if he did, financially I'd be fine with nothing left to me. And we're a partnership, so in my mind as long as either one of us who is left is ok then that's how it should be.\n\nSo think logically about it - what would his financial position have been if you had never been together? Would he have had more savings, would he have maybe reined in his lifestyle spending that you do together and instead got himself a mortgage? Those losses need to be considered, because they are losses to him, even though they're intangible. In a court of law those are taken into consideration these days when couples split, because in many instances the lower earning partner loses out more financially by being in the relationship.\n\nAnd what about later? You bequeath your home to someone else, your pension to someone else again, and he gets a lump sum (probably highly taxed, by the way, so never as much as you think) which may not even be enough to buy anywhere on his own with his current salary. And what happens if you both live a very long time and he's old, in ill health, and unable to work by that time? Would it cover care home fees? Most people find that savings don't cover that, they usually sell their homes to fund it - but if he doesn't have one, what then?\n\nI think maybe by treating your finances and your relationship as entirely separate you've misjudged both a little! They're interdependent, like most things in life - you can keep them apart, one informs the other!\n\nI hope you work out what you want to do and it all goes well for both of you, it seems like you're both well meaning people.", "Agreed this is AI vibes all the way", "Hi thanks for this - I have seen a few responses like this and a few different ones.

Do I see myself still with them in 10 years? If the answer to these questions is yes almost everyone effectively views themselves as what you would call only for married people-- they view ther lives and finances as basically entwined.\n\nThis usually does not entail a total and complete merging of finances, and there are certainly risks to that before having the legal protections of a marriage.
