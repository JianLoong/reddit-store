However, YTA because you are not taking your partners overall financial status into account.  \n\n>I pay everything for the house myself bills, mortgage, insurance whereas my partner contributes holidays, food, luxuries and general non traceable expenses.\n\nSo he has basically been funding your guys' lifestyle, while you put a roof over his head. This may sound like a fair exchange of resources, but he has not, during that time, been able to make any investment of his own towards a personal dwelling; while your equity has continued to increase. He has been investing his money into you and your relationship, and while noble, your decision to leave your home to your sibling dismisses his role as your life partner in exchange for that of a tenant. You doubled down by getting cold feet about purchasing a home together.", "NTA. But what you are effectively telling your partner is that he has to move out of his domicile if you die. If I were him I\u2019d be upset too. My love dies and I\u2019m kicked out of my house - what a crappy year that would be.", "YTA.\n\nRegardless of how it came to be, your current partner allowed you to live rent free for three years which likely contributed to you being able to buy your current home. Unless you made it clear to him prior to moving in that because you agreed that he would pay for luxuries, you would hold it against him in the event of your death, I think it's shitty. It seems like he would have much preferred to contribute toward the bills and mortgage so that he wouldn't be kicked out of the home you shared and forced to make arrangements while grieving shortly after your death to allow your siblings to take possession of the property. \n\nI know some couples prefer to split bills and keep separate accounts, but you don't even want this person who is presumably someone you intend to spend your life since you are planning to buy another house with to get your pension like most other partners do. Maybe that's a thing too and I just don't know about it, but it just makes me sad that your partner may view you as his family when it's clear you don't feel the same way after 5 and a half years of commitment. It's good that you told him now so he can decide how he wants to move forward because this may be a dealbreaker or change his financial plans for the future.", "NTA. He's been living with you rent-free for 2 and a half years. He has a place to stay in the event something happens to you, and it sounds like he would still be rent-free.

You guys have been a team since you lived in his family flat for free to save money. You managed to save enough to buy a house and he moved in with you. You guys lived within your means; the house being your equity so you pay that, and he pays for food and other miscellaneous things. You have a home, a life, and a future being in your 30s.\n\nHere's where I think the situation goes into YTA. Your siblings have children so you will your house to them. Which logically means you shall will the house to all possible future children to keep things fair, and the house will be sold and divided up. This is your partner's home. You're operating under the assumption he can just go back and live in the family flat. But what if in 10 20 30 40 years, that's no longer an option. Also since you're not married and your assets would of probably gone to your siblings anyway, this sorta feels like this was done as a power play.\n\nIf I may, you can put a clause in your will.

You were never married but you intended to compromise by making him the beneficiary of your life insurance.\n\nHe does pay for something, so he has money of his own all and all, and an LI policy should be enough to cover that, and you can also buy more coverage to it, if you need to bequeath him more money.\n\nUltimately by law he doesn't get a say because you aren't married, but you are making an effort to work out some kind of agreement that benefits everyone and that's not wrong.\n\nBuy an insurance policy with a larger sum of money to compensate for the loss of the home.\n\nUltimately it goes back to who will be the one to take care of things when you pass and with no legality, he can only do what you allow him to do, so try and agree like you already are.", "YTA\n\nDo you even like your partner?

Value of property against value of life insurance he will receive. If the values are similar then you are making it unnecessarily complicated.

When he first moved in how was the process of deciding finances? People keep saying if he doesn\u2019t contribute to the directly he has no claim but if you didn\u2019t give him the chance that seems unfair. Also just because he doesn\u2019t pay rent he does contribute. The direct money trail doesn\u2019t really count imo when the accounting is concerned. Also reading your comments it doesn\u2019t seem super clear on who was the one to present the relationship as marriage free. Sorry for so many questions as I do think this is a grey area but ultimately he is getting something and his name isn\u2019t on the property.", "NAH. If your partner isn't contributing to your mortgage and isn't on the deed of your house, and you aren't married, it's not unusual for your property to go to family. \n\nHowever, this was a common situation in same sex relationships in the past where the dead partner's family comes in and kicks the surviving partner out, leaving them with nothing/homeless. Your partner is getting your life insurance though and it sounds like he has/had his own place.\n\nIf you purchase a home with your partner, it would be weird to leave half of the joint property to your sibling rather than buy the place with joint tenancy with right of survivorship.

You can't just ignore that and say he isn't contributing to your home.\n\nOr, in another way: would you be able to pay the same amounts towards your home and bills if your partner didn't pay for food and all that?

Whatever he paid to fund your lifestyle would have gone to rent or the maintanance of his own property. Besides, he has his savings and his own property, wanting your house too is just greedy and selfish.\n\nBesides, I don't really understand why people get upset when you decide that they are not, in fact, entitled to your savings/property/insurance etc. Especially when they are more than alright without whatever you would leave to them. I say your life insurance is more than generous,and wanring to take care of your family in the event of your death is very noble.", "As a woman who makes more than her partner, bought the house, and doesn't believe in marriage, I 100% think YTA.\n\nWe've been together for 10+ years, this is OUR home and OUR life together.

I know he'll do right by the rest of my family and if he doesn't then he'll have a reason and that's good enough for me. \n\nWe do our finances very similar to what you described, but I accept that putting all the assets in my name doesn't mean they are my assets, they are ours because he's my partner and his contributions to my life may not make it onto an asset list, but they are still valuable.\n\nYou come across like you view your relationship as a transaction, you don't actually care about him and his well being. Additionally, you seem to intentionally structure finances so that you can keep what's \"yours\" separate from what is \"his\" and undervaluing his contribution to your life.", "YTA.

As in he gets nothing from before a marriage but everything obtained afterward would be split evenly, except what would be awarded to family. I\u2019d hate to have money and greed be the ruin of any relationship but unfortunately these things do happen. \nI hope he\u2019s just being cautions maybe? About your future together if you were to stay in that home and not purchase another? But I would want to be sure if I were you.

Him being with me doesn\u2019t make him entitled to a house that was there long before be met and it\u2019s totally normal. \n\nYou are in no way in the wrong here, if the two of you work together on getting a place for the 2 of you then that\u2019s a different story but everything you wrote sounds super fair and reasonable to me. I\u2019d do the same!", "I edited my response, I missed that your life insurance was to go to him.\n\nIf he has anything invested in the house, even paying for more things for you to give you more available cash to pay into the house; it should have been discussed.\n\nEnd of the day, you can do whatever you want. I can just see why the house could be a possible discussion point. Pension is yours to do what you want with.", "Earlier you said you were not responsible for him because you aren't married and here you admit that you're the one who doesn't want to get married. It almost sounds like you've designed this entire situation to benefit you while also being able to argue that you have no obligation to your partner. It seems like you need to sit down and have a conversation with him about what your views and expectations are about your relationship so he can make an informed decision on whether this is the right relationship for him if he can never achieve full partner status without a marriage you're unwilling to commit to.", "Then you\u2019re not going to enter a contract that entitles him to anything automatically when you die and neither is he. So if he\u2019s not putting money into the investment (house), he doesn\u2019t get a say in the payout. You may just want to write something in where he can stay there x amount of time while he gets new living arrangements sorted so that he\u2019s not just put on the street if something happens to you unexpectedly.", "If you aren\u2019t married, start testing him out.  Then give him the boot.", "Sorry life insurance***", "You sound like you give zero Fs about this person, or at the very least, do not view him as a lifelong partner. \n\nFrom your comments, you really have no interest in marrying him or owning a home with him (since you\u2019re super ready to reconsider the notion once he expresses a very valid concern). \n\nSounds like you\u2019re happy to have what he has to offer for now, but you do not see yourself becoming a unit with him in any way. \n\nYou\u2019re not invested at all. I feel sorry for the guy because it sounds like he *is*.", "\u2026 do you like your SO? Is there cheating or something that you wouldn\u2019t want them to receive the house?", "Thanks both - I said very early on I did not want children or to get married.\n\nIn the event of marriage we would need a prenuptial agreement and division of assets. The conversation hasn't really gone any further from there. I do want marriage sometimes but it is not enough for me to get married just like children some days I want them but it is not enough to make an informed decision.", "Thanks for this I am unsure how you came to that conclusion. Maybe I am compartmentalizing too much, I can't see how a house that he didn't buy should go to him in the event that I die? Surely it should go to the people who helped me with it.\n\nLikewise my life insurance is going to my partner to help him in the event of death.", "I don't have that value sorry but I can try to find out? At an estimate perhaps \u00a3500-700 a month. That includes trips away, food, dates etc. I have less disposable income because I pay for my mortgage, the house bills (gas/electric/internet/water/council tax) my own bills car, subscriptions etc and then I am studying self funded also.", "Yeah I think so aswell. Thank you", "So for clarity I lived at my partner's family flat for three years. We then moved out into my own house and are deciding to get a new house together. The family flat he does not own is vacant and has all his things still in there essentially storage overflow.", "Thanks for your reply - that is not my intent as I said in other posts I do love him. However we are not married so I do not quite understand why it is my responsibility to house him in the event that I die? Providing that we do not own a house together or have children.\n\nFor context nothing is left to me from his end, it is to his family so I am not sure what I am missing.", "Touch\u00e9 thanks for this right in the feels. You know what I don't actually know.", "No problems. I see where you're coming from", "Thanks for this it has been helpful. So I agree with some contradictions. I feel I am not responsible for adults, yet my life insurance is set up to him, also on that note why would I be responsible for my adult family members and to also leave stuff to them. I concede to that discrepancy. Underlying I still agree no one is responsible for anyone unless it is marriage, family or children.\n\nI'm not sure about the design part because I bought this house before I even met him. So it's not part of some convoluted plan.", "I don't want to test him out I do love him, I think we need a chat about financial expectations.", "Marriage is really just a piece of paper to the government. If you are in a long term committed relationship you should still talk about the division of assets, and shoot a prenup. You should still look into the legality of most. Someplace, if you are together for longer then x amount of years it\u2019s a common law. \n\nBecause you do not plan on getting married ( even if it\u2019s not technically off the table) you both should talk about your future and what it it looks like together. Not just you planing your future and hopes and informing him about it. \n\nAgain if my partner who never wants to get married, tells me they do not care about me after the die because we never got married, I would rethink my entire relationship. I am in between getting married or not because it doesn\u2019t really change much (except giving the spouse all the asset and debt without needing forms) if a person wants to cheat, leave, etc. Or be the best partner, they are going to do it, no matter marriage or not. But your view point is the reason why I would be more towards marriage then not", "It just seems like you don\u2019t see it as both of yours\u2019 home, but rather it\u2019s your home and he\u2019s like a lodger. You don\u2019t seem concerned that he would be losing his home if you died and would have to go through the upheaval of moving while he\u2019s grieving.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make you TA, because you\u2019re not married so legally and morally you don\u2019t owe him the house, but from a relationship point of view it is understandable why he is upset.", "It's not a \"house\", it's a home. Kicking someone out of their home after losing their spouse (or spouse equivalent) is profoundly destabilizing and frankly cruel.", "How did your siblings help you purchase the house?", "And allowing you to live rent free for 3 years doesn't count as helping you?", "So he paid for the fun money + food while you paid all other living expenses for both of you? Then NTA. I think you should add this detail to the post because the initial description made me (and probably many other people) think that you only paid for bills related to your house ownership while he paid for all other expenses.", "How much is the mortgage & house bills per month?", "Unless you want to go through the trouble of changing it later, I would leave the life insurance to someone else as well. Seems like he's had everything given to him all his life and expects you to do the same. That's a very entitled attitude.", "Well, he doesn\u2019t have a property to give to you. It\u2019s his family owned property. You said you are planning to buy a new house together. Are you keeping this house too?", "If he lives in your house with you now, are you not concerned about him being evicted from his home while grieving?", "Thanks for this I don't know why marriage doesn't come naturally to me. I've never consciously thought about it. It is also hard trying to talk to family and friends when the shoe is on the other foot, and the male typically earns more and owns the house so I get a different perspective.", "Thanks for taking the time to explain this I am not being dense. I appreciate where you are coming from. I have encouraged my partner to buy his own home and rent it as a plan b or purchase the family flat but to Avail at the moment.", "OK I don't know how to do that but I will try make an edit", "This has struck something in me I didn't even consider. You're onto something but I don't know what.", "Yes I would be keeping the house, no plans yet what to do with it.", "He has a family flat he can go to which is still accessible as far as I am aware. He still pays bills for that flat so it is active.", "I get that. Maybe you should talk to someone in a similar situation as you, even if it\u2019s a male. It could be that your boyfriend isn\u2019t really the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. Or that you feel like his not contributing enough to build a life for him self. To me,It\u2019s not the fact that you don\u2019t want to get married, it\u2019s the fact that your not creating an US, but a his and hers.", "I think you're missing the point here.  You seem to view this relationship as a transaction, he could get a house if he wants, what's the big deal?  To him, this is not about having somewhere else to live, or fallback on.  He wants to build a life with you, and you don't seem to have that desire at all.  \n\nYou've been together 5 years, do you see yourself spending the rest of your life with your partner?  If not, why not?  If so, why this I pay/ he pays attitude?", "Before breaking up a relationship you stated you do see your self spending the rest of your life with\u2026 talk to someone whose not on reddit. A professional and a close family/friend who you know with tell you the truth and has nothing to gain either way. I always say I have my reddit glasses on, and try to give a different point of view from everyone else because if you been on this app enough, everyone\u2019s solution is always break up/divorce, or the negative side of things.\n\nA professional might be able to help you see things that you aren\u2019t. Because you have stated that last line multiple times. You need to figure out how you feel first, then worry about everything else", "Never done this before but I'm going to message you. I may have the insight you need.", "Well that\u2019s different. If he will have a joint house with you it shouldn\u2019t matter what happens to the one you own yourself. I do however think your way of speaking about him should change, and really, saying he contributes nothing but saying he pays for food, dates, holidays, and council tax is really contradictory. If you feel he contributes nothing, have a conversation. But all you mentioned doesn\u2019t sound completely like nothing to me.", "I more meant sentimental issues\n\nLike all the memories you have together there?", "Thank you for this - these comments are incredibly helpful for me. Yes I am trying to find females who earn more and earn the house but I find it tricky. For context I don't want anyone to jump in to say he is a good for nothing, we are both educated the same and he has a very good career.", "Hi thank you for this - so I do see myself spending my life with this person hense being together for five years.\n\nI think there is a theme occuring where I am missing the point but I do not know what point is. In my mind it is as black and white has he has not contributed or help build it so he will not be getting it - it will go to the family who helped me. However with that considered, my life insurance is set up for him so he does not go without in the event that I die. So I am not sure where to go next.\n\nI think it is important in this context to outline who pays because as i mentioned in my edit the societal norms. I wanted to be clear to say I lived rent free in his flat for three years and therefore he is also rent free and bill free in my home, that is why  I explicitly state who pays for what for transparency. I do not expect anything from him in the event that he dies, of which I believe is also left to his family. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI", "I agree, I didn't think I needed to talk but I will!", "Hi thanks for this.\n\n For clarity, He doesn't pay council tax I do.  He contributes to the relationship financially. I mean he contributes nothing specifically related to the house.", "So thanks for this - again a tricky point he says he hates living here and is only here for me and to be near his work. When I encouraged him to purchase his own place he said he'd rather us wait and go in together. The problem we have is that I do not have the deposit fast enough that he has to forward on a house together. But the mortgage lender has given us more allowance for the future house based on my earnings than his. So essentially the house he wants to move into and purchase is off the lions share of my salary. I would rather us just go for a house that is affordable for the two of us.", "I\u2019m only judging from what you have told me. I never though was good for nothing , just maybe doesn\u2019t have your mindset on the housing front.\n\nI was reading some of your other comments, you guys might need to sit down and have a conversation about what you want and how to get it.\n\nYou do not a) have the money for a deposit for a new home and b) do not want to buy a home at the top of your budget. And your bf a)doesn\u2019t like your home b) can\u2019t afford his dream house on his salary c) wants to buy a joint property., So your solution is for your BF to buy his own home. But how would that look? Would you both move into the same house? Rent one and that person gets the benefit of not having to pay as much /nothing/ earns money from the rental while one person pays all the bills for the current spot? You both live in separate houses?\n\nIt might be time your boyfriend start paying house bills. What ever that looks like but it\u2019s time. You live with him for free  ( doesn\u2019t matter that it was a family home, he could of still charge you rent) and he lived with you for free (might of been longer then the reverse). \n\nSit down lay out all financials and figure things out. Even if it\u2019s merging car insurances and phone plans and having him pay it. Figure out the game plan for the possibility of getting a new place and how that would look.", "I think maybe you need to think about what love is to you, and what it is to your partner. The reason people are getting this impression is because the way you talk about your partner doesn\u2019t match up with how most people feel or talk about their life partner that they love.", "If you see yourself spending your lives together, I don\u2019t understand your focus on money. He has not contributed (directly) to the house, so you say he should have no say in it. Did you have any say in the destinations of your holidays, or the groceries he buys? \n\nTry to look at things based on a partnership, not \u201cI buy X he buys Y\u201d, but more of a \u201ctogether we can buy X and Y\u201d.\n\nThat, I suspect is why your partner is upset, he sees you both as a unit, and you see things as two individuals.", "I personally think that you are NTA in this situation, BUT I do think that you went about this in the wrong way. There are a ton of ways to make sure that the property stays with your family after you pass away while making sure that your boyfriend would still be able to live there in the case you two never do get a house together. A simple clause in your will that states your Boyfriend would be in control of the house as long as he maintains it until his death and then it is given to your family is fairly easy to write into any will. But again if you two do go and purchase a house together I do not feel like he would see this as a issue anymore, from your boyfriends point of view even if he doesn't like the house, even if he doesn't like the location, he still loves you. He wants to build a life together with you, build generational wealth with you, and over all just be together with you. The house you are currently staying in has sentimental value to him more so than any life insurance policy ever will, he has memories of you and him being together in the house, watching movies, cooking dinner, having date nights, all things that after you pass that have way more value that any monetary thing could possess. You are thinking very much about facts here and not inputting the fact of sentimental value. I would like to state again that IF you two do go and buy a house together then I believe all of this will be alleviated, but it should be something that you both talk to each other about, ask him why it bothers him so much that he wouldn't be getting the house, ask him if you put in your will that he could maintain control over it until he passes and then it would go to your family if that would be okay, there are a ton of things here to unpack but I think those would be making steps in the right direction.", "Thanks for putting it so elegantly. \n\nSometimes I feel I have to push to earn more because even in the house I have now he couldn't do the reverse for us. There's no way he could run a mortgage and pay for all of its expenses. His salary isn't enough.\n\nI don't think he quite understands what it's like to not make a mortgage or to go without for prioritising bills, he's never had to.\n\nThat is part of my fear that his family pulls the flat and then he is homeless I do not know how to broach the subject. Either way he is reliant on me for a home. Few people have mentioned luxuries that he contributes, again if I wasn't paying for a second Masters to earn more money, I could afford the luxuries. For editing they are also luxuries and not a common standard of living. It's a double edged sword.\n\nDigress will take a new sub if needed. Again these comments are incredibly helpful in me unpicking what's going on.", "Thanks for this I agree I am very black and white with no emotion sometimes. I'm not trying to be cold."]}
