I said that didn't make sense, and it makes cleaning and organizing the room take longer.

My wife admitted I was right, so that's how we've been doing things for a while.\n\nToday my in-laws were visiting and saw Dee playing with a toy. My mother in law asked why Dee had Sam's toy. I said we don't split the toys up like that. None of the toys are Sam's or Dee's. All the toys belong to Sam and Dee.\n\nMy mother in law was upset, because she picked that toy out specifically for Sam. I just sort of shrugged. It's a plastic frog; there's nothing special about it.

Then they left. My wife said going forward we should keep toys bought for Sam separate, because it upsets her parents that the toys are communal.\n\nI said I wasn't okay with that. If we do that, we'd have to buy more stuff for Dee and less for Sam for them to have an equal number of toys.

Your in-laws send gifts to Sam and not Dee to ensure that both kids know he\u2019s favored?? Nope.", "So the real problem is here that they\u2019re favoring your male child over your female.

You need to address this with your wife and open her eyes because this will extend beyond toys in the future", "NTA , your in-laws are the assholes. You are your kids parents not your in laws. And giving more gifts to one kid is just cruel.", "NTA since the grandparents are favoring one child over the other either the item belongs to both children or neither child.", "NTA. \n\nHave they ever sent Dee any toys specifically for her? Similar amounts? Sounds like your IL's favor Sam.", "I wouldn\u2019t have anyone around my children that play favorites & treat one of my children badly like that .

They\u2019re you\u2019re kids, and you\u2019re parenting them as you see fit in a way that doesn\u2019t damage them. There\u2019s a time for them to learn about individual property.

Your in-laws are blatantly favoring the \"boy\" grandchild, and that's not something to put up with. Your wife should not allow that either. Consider that they are even angry that Dee gets to touch a toy they intended for Sam alone. That's pretty mean. \n\nI don't see anything wrong with keeping most toys communal (I bet the kids are great at sharing!), though as they get older, they are going to want more \"private\" property and you'll need to respect that and smoothly transition to a hybrid or new system.", "I had to scroll back up and reread. I was able to confirm both of these children are related to the grandparents. Please correct me if I got that wrong...\nSo I don't understand why the grandparents are acting like Dee took something away from Sam. \n\nNTA. For the following reasons, it's your house, these are your kids and you can raise them and dictate how things go in your house. Your wife should not try to kowtow to the grandparents because it's an insane request. If they don't like Dee playing with a toy then they should stop sending things, as you suggested. Your family has a system in place that works. If it isn't broken, dont try to fix it. The grandparents need to learn some boundaries.", "You are right, and your wife is wrong!

Here you illustrate grandparents who blatantly favor one child over the other. That is unacceptable.

Then why one gets more than the other.being 3&2 I doubt it has to do with  anything how they behave with their grand parents. I smell slight misogyny here. Have you confronted them about their favoritism to your son ,?\n\nAlso it is great that your kids share most of their toys but have boundaries on specific ones they sleep with. Sounds like good parenting to me, and would suggest to start not accepting gifts from your in laws at all unless it is addressed to both kids or both kids get different but equivalent toys. Else they ll spoil your 2 yr old son and let your daughter have self worth issues. \nDo try to ask their reason for favouritsm  and hope it isn't a cultural thing", "NTA. What the hell? So the grandparents send things usually addressed to Sam meaning Sam gets much more than Dee. Do they have a reason to not like the younger one? Does your wife not see that her parents are fostering favouritism? Also gendered toys are so old fashioned.", "NTA\n\nIt's your household, yall decide what goes. Not your parents, not her parents. You two. Tell them to piss off.", "NTA, favoritism is harmful to sibling relationships.  I would do the same thing.", "NTA - what horrible grandparents to favour one child. I would tell them not to bother sending anything else.", "NTA this is ridiculous. It's literally impossible to keep toys separate with kids. Ask me about our Lego and Lego friends (\"girl\" Lego) collections. Bits and pieces everywhere. Kids will share toys. End of story. If you don't let them, they're gonna be nightmares in school and have no friends.", "Favoring one grandchild over the other is so ridiculous. I feel bad for Dee. She is going to see it when she is old enough, if you keep allowing In-Laws to send stuff just for Sam. I wonder why your wife is allowing it to happen too. She should put her family in check before it affects your daughters mental health.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your in-laws are doing this because they value the male grandchild more than the female.\n\nThis is pure cultural misogyny.  Point out its absurdity by suggesting you incorporate misogyny into your marriage, so she has to do what you say. This will get her on your side pretty quick.", "NTA. I can't even find the right words for this.", "NTA. Are they sending Sam better/more toys because of his gender? That needs shut down. Also, do they think you are going to punish your daughter if she tries to play with one of your son's toys? All kinds of issues here.", "NTA. They are buying stuff just for Sam?  Sounds like they only favor the male. That is not okay and good for you shutting that crap down.", "Your in-laws are sexist and you are 1000% right that the kids will notice. The fact that your wife sees this and then retracts when confronted means she needs to set bigger boundaries.

Its not selfish or ungrateful to want both your kids to be treated equally. Imagine in a few years time when Sam is being reprimanded for something and he calls them, will your wife stick with say, being grounded, or let it go cos her parents think it's unfair to their grandson?", "WTF?  NTA\n\nIf that is how they feel they shouldn't give any gifts.  Period.\n\nIt is unreasonable to expect a 2 and 3 year old to know which toys are 'theirs'.  In fact it's not just unreasonable it is stupid.", "Nta.", "NTA\n\nI don't see anything wrong really, with what you're doing, but I would just tell them to not send anything at all. I'm sure they have enough toys.", "INFO: Have you asked them why they are sending a bunch of gifts for your son and hardly any for your daughter? Are you willing to split them up if they send an equal number of gifts?", "NTA.... its gonna end up being played with regardless of who it's \"addressed\" to in this case.", "INFO\n\n> My in-laws often send us stuff for the kids, and it is usually addressed to Sam.\n\n#WHY HAVE YOU NOT CONFRONTED THEM?\n\nMake them **explain their behavior**.", "NTA. Like you said the kids are close in age and should be learning to share anyway. \n\n>My mother in law asked why Dee had Sam's toy.\n\n>My mother in law was upset, because she picked that toy out specifically for Sam. I just sort of shrugged. It's a plastic frog; there's nothing special about it.\n\nThis is weird to me because even if it was Sam's why would it matter if Dee plays with it when Sam isn't? Toys are often shared between siblings even as they get older. There is a point where certain things belong two one child but if possible and done respectfully they can be shared. It's not not like they are buying toys four Sam and Sam never gets to play with them because they are given to Dee and only Dee.", "Nta\n\nYou couldn't be more right. If you give in to INL's, you treat your kids unequally.", "I\u2019d start asking why your in laws favor one of your children for starters, like that is the main issue here and it just extends to toys in this case. NTA", "\"I've been thinking about what you said, that you picked out that toy specifically for Sam. So which toy did you pick out for Dee?\"\n\nIf they are able to answer that, follow up with asking them about all the toys they've gifted. On the off chance that the gifts for each kid are substantially equal, just clarify house rules, \"Given the kids ages, we expect them to share. We will make sure to let the recipient know that it was specifically picked out for them by their grandparents, but we will not reorganize the toys or change our rule that both kids are welcome to play with any toys not currently in use).\"\n\nHowever, if as you suspect, there is substantial imbalance, you can be more forceful:\n\n\"Sorry for the confusion, but we were accepting the gifts under the impression that they were intended for both of your grandchildren. We cannot accept gifts that demonstrate blatant favoritism, so going forward, please only send gifts if you can do so in an even-handed manner.\"\n\nNTA. Your in-laws are appalling. I've literally never heard of a situation where someone called out that the \"wrong\" kid was playing with a toy. Even toys with clearly defined owners are regularly shared within households.\n\nIt's equally concerning that your wife wants to placate her parents, rather than be upset about the awkward position their favoritism puts her in as a mother.
