I said that didn't make sense, and it makes cleaning and organizing the room take longer.

My wife admitted I was right, so that's how we've been doing things for a while.\n\nToday my in-laws were visiting and saw Dee playing with a toy. My mother in law asked why Dee had Sam's toy. I said we don't split the toys up like that. None of the toys are Sam's or Dee's. All the toys belong to Sam and Dee.\n\nMy mother in law was upset, because she picked that toy out specifically for Sam. I just sort of shrugged.

Then they left. My wife said going forward we should keep toys bought for Sam separate, because it upsets her parents that the toys are communal.\n\nI said I wasn't okay with that. If we do that, we'd have to buy more stuff for Dee and less for Sam for them to have an equal number of toys.

For the following reasons, it's your house, these are your kids and you can raise them and dictate how things go in your house. Your wife should not try to kowtow to the grandparents because it's an insane request. If they don't like Dee playing with a toy then they should stop sending things, as you suggested.

Toys are often shared between siblings even as they get older. There is a point where certain things belong two one child but if possible and done respectfully they can be shared.

So which toy did you pick out for Dee?\"\n\nIf they are able to answer that, follow up with asking them about all the toys they've gifted.

We will make sure to let the recipient know that it was specifically picked out for them by their grandparents, but we will not reorganize the toys or change our rule that both kids are welcome to play with any toys not currently in use).\"\n\nHowever, if as you suspect, there is substantial imbalance, you can be more forceful:\n\n\"Sorry for the confusion, but we were accepting the gifts under the impression that they were intended for both of your grandchildren. We cannot accept gifts that demonstrate blatant favoritism, so going forward, please only send gifts if you can do so in an even-handed manner.\"\n\nNTA. Your in-laws are appalling. I've literally never heard of a situation where someone called out that the \"wrong\" kid was playing with a toy. Even toys with clearly defined owners are regularly shared within households.\n\nIt's equally concerning that your wife wants to placate her parents, rather than be upset about the awkward position their favoritism puts her in as a mother.
