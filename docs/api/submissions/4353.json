But my mom did say something to the effect of: you don't need to worry about that (I cannot remember what they were talking about) what you need to do is have a conversation about their unequal treatment of our daughters. The reason why I would never ask my mom to be the one to speak up (by the way) is because it's my dad's family, and therefore his duty. My mom would step up if I asked - but that's not the point. I am lucky that I only deal with this once every few years but it still something that is extremely frustrating and does bring a lot of stress when I have to interact with that side of the family. The day my dad is gone, is the day I will stop making any attempts to see them, to be honest. I don't feel an attachment to them, only like they are long standing acquaintances. If they were to invite me to big events it wouldn't be an automatic yes.\n\nI am lucky I could distance myself from that dynamic - because I grew up in a completely different country than my extended family did, etc. But if I had grown up in the environment you are describing, I would have developed a more fragile sense of self and eventually resented the parent that allowed for that dynamic to flourish and become the norm.\n\nIt makes me emotional to see how you've stepped up for your kiddos.

Like I said, once they get older, real relationships will form and personalities will determine who \"likes\" who. But for *toddlers*, if you dont like both my kids equally and they or I can tell, that's a problem. If my 4yo asked me \"how come <2yo sister> got more presents from grandma and grandpa\", that's a problem. Now I dont mean like he got 5 and she got 6.

If you like one of my kids better than the other, fine. But don't make it obvious to them or to me while they are toddlers and don't understand relationship dynamics. If my kid turns 10 and he's big into horses like my MIL and she wants to get him a special horse related gift and not my daughter because my daughter is into dirt bikes, fine. But if my MIL buys my horse loving son an actual horse, and buys my dirt bike loving daughter a calendar, that's the kind of favoritism/treatment I don't love and at least needs to have a conversation.\n\nAnd to your question, yes, IMO grandparents are held to a higher standard, like parents are. It would be awful of me as a parent to buy one kid a blatently obvious amount more stuff than the other because I like one more, no matter what age. It's my job as a parent to meet each kid where they are, learn their interests, learn them as people, and treat them (relatively) equally based on that. If I'm big into video games, and I have one kid into video games and the other ends up loving football, am I allowed to only give gifts to the video game lover, and the football lover just gets sports-like video games? That's nuts. You better believe as her parent I'm gonna learn about football, what she likes about it, get on her level and show her that she has someone in her corner who genuinely cares about her interests. Does everyone have to do that? No. Do grandparents even? No, but grandparents IMO should put in the extra effort to at least ask me or her how they can support her equally to a sibling.

When my daughter was born and we called my grandma, she said, \"Oh, it's okay, no one will care that you had a girl first,\" which kinda implied someone in the call cared about that. (No one come for my grandma; she's 95 and there's a big time and cultural distance there). My point is that while it doesn't excuse the behavior, lots of cultures place a lot of emphasis on the firstborn boy, and it might be worth having a conversation with your wife/her family about that. That may not be it, but it might be worth exploring if the reason your in-laws reaction was that strong is due to deeply held cultural value stuff.

Besides that, the children being so close in age does mean that the same toys are appropriate for both of them, at least for now. Learning to share their toys is a valuable life skill.", "NTA. And tell they can\u2019t send anything anymore. Their loss.", "I'd tell them that whenever they send a gift for only one child, you'll hold onto it until there is one for the other and give them both a gift at the same time. This was, next time they come, there'll either have their own equal amount or there will be a big pile of unopened gifts for Sam. You can demonstrate the inequality and say you'll not stand for it. You could phrase it as backhanded generosity \"I understand its expensive to buy two gifts at the same time and if you can't afford it, I'll just hold the gift until you can afford to send one for the other child, and as you are getting older, if you forget which one you sent for last time, I'll be able to remind you.\"", "This is correct. OP needs to directly ask his wife and, if needed, his in laws why they think it\u2019s ok to buy Sam more presents than Dee. They either own up their sexism or cover and you can call them out. Especially wife - how she is not more upset that her parents are showing blatant and damaging favouritism is completely beyond me. You can blame old fashioned cultural sexism for the grandparents but why on earth would you accept that as a parent?!", "Me and my brother are three years appart and we had seperate gift at christmas or when people buy us stuff, but we naturally share. \n\nWe never fight for a toy because \"it's MY toy\". It always been our toys. Each of us have our own interest, but we played with everything.", "THIS. I agree with you. If OP doesnt choose this as his hill to die on now he has so many future problems. Honestly it feels like this should have been an issue addressed a long time ago but OPs idea since they have Irish twins and the kids are still young enough not to care (toys are toys when you are a toddler) but OP is only a few short year out from his kids developing different interests and not being able to share so easily. So it's time for gifts or no gifts at all discussion (which I would opt for no gifts at all if grandparents are throwing a shit fit now, I can only imagine what separate gifts would look like). And if OPs wife cant grow a spine and get on board they have bigger problems.", "I'm guessing 2 year old Sammie isn't winning them over with his intellectual prowess", "I\u2019m glad I only have one kid, because my MIL was so upset that my kid was a boy, and keeps pushing us to have another because \u201cdon\u2019t you want a girl?\u201d", "My friend was the favorite of the three girls.  Grandma sent gifts to just her and left out the other girls.  It got to where the parents said she had to send for all or send for none.  When she died, she left stuff to my friend but not the other girls.  It was so obvious how she favored her and my friend felt awful about how grandma treated the other kids.", "It was never valid, but it's now outdated in that it's actually less accepted and harder to get away with. It was accepted, now it's less accepted, but it was never acceptable.", "I always send a big gift for all the kids to share.  One time I sent a whole race car thing to the two boys and something else to the girls... I got videos of the all the girls playing the race car game and it made me so happy!", "You don\u2019t even need culture to be guilty of this. My Mom is white AF and adores \u201cthe boys\u201d while my sister and I are always somehow mean/bad/wrong/etc. we actually all have a great relationship as siblings because we all see through the gender bias bs and my older brother called my mom on it once when she said \u201cwell you know I always liked boys more than girls and you are always going to be my boys.\u201d He replied back that we were her fucking daughters and it was sick to view us differently just because we were born girls and she has a weird hang up. I also see this phenomenon a lot in Senior care. A lot of families have this dynamic where boys = angles girls = the trouble/meanies\u2026even when it\u2019s the daughter doing everything for their mother at that point. Just wanted to say, culture aside, I think this happens a LOT and needs to be stopped!", "My MIL was never so mad as when I was pregnant with my second and said, \u201cI dunno, I\u2019m kind of hoping for another boy\u201d in response to her granddaughter-fever. \n\nI got my wish \ud83d\ude02", "If I were to have another, I\u2019d hope for a boy. For many reasons, but one being she wants a girl. Like she has names picked out. It\u2019s disturbing. I\u2019m glad you got your wish.", "Hah, thwarting her was definitely a bonus. My main reasoning was that my sister and i are 2 years apart (same as the age gap between my sons) and we were very close growing up. Still are.  I\u2019d seen many examples of same-gendered siblings, 1-2 years apart, with that closeness and I hoped for it for my two. \n\nThe other was just practical. We had tons of \u201cboy\u201d stuff, we had a 2-bedroom house and 2 boys would be able to share a room for longer, etc.  Which all held true\u201411 years later they\u2019re still sharing that room, and the younger still has all the clothes etc from the older.", "I wouldn\u2019t know how to be a girl mom, assuming my daughter were to be \u201cgirly\u201d. I mean, I\u2019d be fine with her being that, but I can\u2019t do hair, or makeup, or any of that. I know more \u201cboy\u201d activities. Plus, between my sister and my girl cousins, it just seems entirely more stressful by middle school. \n\nBut also the same practical things as yourself. We would have to move for another bedroom when they got older. Plus I dunno how sharing a room would go at this point now anyway. My kid is 5, seems like sharing a room with a baby would end in disaster.", "I know every toy frog *I'VE* ever seen required a penis to operate it. /s", "This favoritism is going to continue and become apparent to the kids as they get older. NTA for treating toys for children near the same age as communal, but if you don\u2019t get this sorted out and make it clear to your in-laws that your children are to be treated equally, you will become TA.", "One can only imagine the wife has been treated as less than her entire life for being a girl. Hopefully her husband can help her realize that\u2019s bullshit and break that cycle.", "Damn that\u2019s so sad.", "Lol!\ud83d\ude04 \nWhen my grandmother decided she wanted a great-granddaughter before she died, she started cornering my sister and me (we each had one son) and giving us tips on how to hook up with some random guy at a bar. She didn't care how it happened; she wanted that baby girl! \nUnfortunately, she didn't get her wishes fulfilled until after her death.", "At that age, kids barely differentiate between what is theirs or not. Especially toys that are appealing to both kids.", "This is true. Mine are both girls (7 and 10). All toys land in the playroom but they have bins in their bedrooms for the toys they prefer not to share. Surprisingly it really isn\u2019t much. They are happy with this arrangement as typically they just play with everything together and only separate their books and electronics.", "This!!", "Exactly this! The abusive favouritism is shockingly obvious and yet for some reason she just doesn\u2019t care! It\u2019s awful. Good luck op.", "oh she already will. the world will just do that anyways.", "You are finding a lot of excuses for your wide and her family in this comments... You are the asshole. Not in this particular story but in general.", "OMG, I totally read this as Dee was a stepchild and was still gonna say NTA, but if they're full siblings, NTA and WTF, that doesn't even make *sense* except as sexism.", "Yes but OP needs to force them to specifically say it. They will deny it if you accuse them of favoritism so OP needs to ask them to explain themselves.", "Yeah OP why are your in-laws so sexist and your wife is in agreement with them? Call it out for what it is. You\u2019re very on top of things to keep all toys mixed. NTA.", "You do get that your wife is allowing her parents to favor your son because he's male, right? You have yet to acknowledge any comments that she is facilitating misogyny.", "I couldn't quite put my finger on what was bugging me even deeper. This is it. Even if the toy had gone to and been kept by their obvious favorite, the \"other\" child isn't even allowed to _touch it_ according to their thought pattern? Neither of my children would be subjected to these people. The wife needs some help too.", "Oh I definitely think they did. But sometimes people are in denial or they\u2019ve made peace with how they were treated. However, I think throwing those facts in her face may either be a reality check OR remind her of any lingering deep seeded feelings about it that might make her realize she doesn\u2019t want that for her own daughter", "My SILs mother apologised to my mother when my niece was born. Her literal words were, sorry it wasnt a boy. We were all so bewildered and grossed out. Yeah asian mindset is still effed when it comes to gender."]}
