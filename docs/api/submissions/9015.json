It's important you face that head on, but it's clear she still wants you in her life despite her anger. So, what are you both supposed to do? You need to work on resolving the issue by having a reasonable conversation about your failings and what the parameters of your relationship are going forward. \n\nIt's understandable you don't want to be yelled at over and over again, and the fact that she's not able to see you without yelling isn't good for her either.

You\u2019re the parent it\u2019s your responsibility to hang out with your children not theirs.", "In this particular situation, you\u2019re definitely NTA. \nBut you were a crap dad, I mean even if you managed to do more for them. \n\nMy dad is a shitty dad who tries to have a relationship with me but I legitimately loathe him, and want nothing to do with him. \nSo when he called me one time and mentioned my \u201cgringo\u201d boyfriend and \u201cgueda\u201d daughter I was super uncomfortable. \nBecause it means he stalks my page even though he made it clear that myself and my siblings were not a priority for him. \n\nHe even told me I love you, and I felt so creeped out because I hadn\u2019t see the dude for over 23 years. \n\nTry resolving whatever is wrong with your eldest daughter because it does sound like she has a lot of resentment towards you.", "YTA", "NTA You may not have been a good dad to them, but you don't have to be a permanent punching bag for your daughter. If she doesn't want a relationship with you other than to verbally attack you, then I think I would not see her either. \n\nShe has every right to hold a grudge if that is what she chooses. You need to tell her that this dynamic doesn't work for you anymore. If she wants to have a relationship, she will have to stop treating you the way she has been. Why keep the negativity going?", "NTA--it doesn't sound like you were as shit as everybody made it seem unless there is something I'm missing. You went to various events and did things with them. Made sure they weren't struggling financially and have opportunity once they finished HS (which no parent is responsible for doing in any case) I am wondering if your oldests mom did some poisining against you the others didnt.", "Jeez, people, give the guy a break. He wasn't there 24/7 for his kids, but he did pay his child support and attempted to stay in contact. A whole hell of a lot of men don't do THAT much.  Just because you are physically present for your children  does not mean that you're a good parent.", "INFO: You say she yells at you for the same thing each time you see her. What's she yelling about?\n\nI feel like YTA if her \"yelling\" is her venting about an issue you have the power to address and apologize for, and you're simply avoiding her because you don't want to deal with said issue.\n\nYou might NBTA if the issue is something out of your hands.", "I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re an honest shit father, and really this is more of that AHry, or if you are a guy doing his best berating himself cause he expects more of himself\u2026or a real \u2018nice guy\u2019 (/s) idk \n\nShe is the oldest, probably remembers more. Have you ever done anything to look into how to resolve this with her? Did you call your daughter and offer to go to counselling maybe?

Kids are not convenient fyi\u2026and you probably did not\u2026yta", "[removed]", "Because they're 100% effective.\n\nI get it, you want to pile on the asshole, but let's keep it on topic. You really don't know enough about the situation to be justifying such a silly comment.", "What does that have to do with his question?", "There are a hell of a lot of kids, that would be cool with your description. \n\nCrap dad or not, there's no reason why he should continue to see a child that can't get over it and move on.  Why would you keep yourself stuck in a cycle of constant remembering the bad and not moving on a enjoying to good.", "I wish more parents in general (not just dads) understood this.  Being a parent is being there for the bad times as well like the toddler tantrums, or the playground injuries or the squabbles of elementary school drama.  \n\nHe didn't deal with them then, and so he has no idea how to handle a bad time now.", "How is he atoning with the oldest when he expects her to do all the work in their relationship. He wants her to come to him instead of calling her and asking to see her. \n\nMy dad is kinda like this and I\u2019m always the one who has to call (and he complains I don\u2019t do that often enough) but I would love to talk to him and see him more often but I don\u2019t want to be the only one putting in any effort.", "I was thinking Disneyland dooch.....", "Yup.  As a direct result of years of inflicting emotional pain on his own child, now has to listen to a few hours  of being called out for his shitty behavior.

There's a reason my husband went NC with him.

It was like asking, \u201cI abandoned my kids at an early age. AITA for wanting to wear red shoes to my oldest\u2019s wedding?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t get a pass just because you buried the lede.

I think what made me feel this was \u201cI just let them know when I\u2019m in town and leave it up to them\u201d. I think he should make more of an effort to talk to her and spend time with her, but seeing as I\u2019m relating this to my own life I\u2019m obviously biased.", "Right. All three of them from the same dude. Cause that's exactly what women want out of life, to give their children deadbeat dads.", "Yeah, agreed.  Dude is clearly an asshole in general, but narrowing it down to the situation being discussed, it's not an asshole move to not inform someone you're in town, and you're not obligated to see everyone in your family every time you're in town anyway.", "That's not what I said. Again with the assumptions."]}
