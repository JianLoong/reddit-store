For this specific question.  But you sound like an asshole on general.", "You are an AH, no question about it, but in this specific incident I'd  say NTA.", "You're an AH in general regarding your children. Your oldest does have a right to be upset with you about being what you describe yourself as a \"shit father\" . She probably has a hard time forgiving you because she has watches you be shit for the longest.\nIn this particular situation NTA but overall a big one", "Sounds like you\u2019ve confused \u201cpicking up the tab and checking in at a handful of events\u201d for \u201cbeing a dad.\u201d\n\nYou showed up for the fun stuff, and splashed some cash around, but that\u2019s not being a dad. Making sure the child support check clears isn\u2019t being a dad. \n\nYou willfully excluded yourself from their lives because other things were more important to you, and now you\u2019re annoyed that one of them harbors some resentment over that. \n\nYou tried to make sure your kids didn\u2019t hate you, but you were never a dad to them. The money you spent was just as much a salve for your own guilty conscience as it was a benefit for your kids. Sorry that you\u2019re experiencing some totally predictable cause and effect from that. \n\nYTA.", "Ugh. I guess NTA for this very specific scenario, but generally YTA. Look, the fact is your daughter wouldn't hold all of this resentment towards you if you'd been a good father. She gives you a hard time because you gave her a hard time - as the oldest, you missed out more of her life.", "In this situation (and this situation only), NAH.\n\nYour daughter has long, unresolved anger towards you. It's important you face that head on, but it's clear she still wants you in her life despite her anger. So, what are you both supposed to do? You need to work on resolving the issue by having a reasonable conversation about your failings and what the parameters of your relationship are going forward. \n\nIt's understandable you don't want to be yelled at over and over again, and the fact that she's not able to see you without yelling isn't good for her either.  I can empathize that you ducked out this time because you couldn't manage the emotional stress, but if you want to improve your relationship, you need to talk and go to therapy with her so she can expand on her anger and learn whether she even wants to have a relationship going forward.\n\nIf you don't do this, then you are, indisputably, the AH.", "So this is tough, NTA for this specific situation. However YTA for creating this issue anyway, offer to go to family therapy with her. Tell her you can\u2019t spend time with her getting berated for the same mistakes over and over again, pay for the family therapy, go with her, talk it out with a professional. She needs closure, a professional will help her get it with you. Going to see your other kids and not her when you know a lot of her issues come from you having those kids at all and not settling down to be a family with her mom who you knocked up is an A move tho.

You would probably not be the asshole if she literally does just sit you down and complain at you the whole time (as well as if she's done that dozens of times before/literally every time you get together), but with these kinds of posts the OP is often projecting. \n\nYou know you're guilty of not always being a great father, but even though some people can own up to mistakes, sometimes hearing about them explicitly can make them overly defensive. Have you apologized fully?", "What does your oldest daughter yell at you about?  How do you respond?", "I guess some people never learned about condoms.", "YTA. You were a Disney Dad, two let it slip, one didn\u2019t. Now you make no effort. Way to live up to low expectations", "YTA.\n\nYour kids won\u2019t hang around hoping you'll change just to be disappointed over and over again.\n\nSo you either **STEP UP** or **FUCK OFF**.\n\nEither step up as a FATHER or tell them you're not interested in a relationship with them.", "NTA\n\nFor the question you asked, no you aren't.\n\nBut you definitely were the AH.\n\nYour eldest daughters tirades are the outcome of a lifetime of being an AH.\n\nIt sounds like you are doing your best to atone for all of that and for that, I honestly applaud you.\n\nIt might be time to have an honest heart to heart with your daughter. Explain that as much as you love her, want her in your life, and hope to continue seeing her, the simple fact is that every time you see, she unloads on you in a negative way about your failings as a father for hours on end. That is her prerogative, you probably deserve it, and you are not saying any of this to change her, but give the situation and everything you were dealing with in that moment you couldn't handle it.", "I grew up rough. Went no contact with my father for years. Now, *nothing* will make up for certain parts of my youth. But, when we finally did talk, he apologized, and I accepted it as genuine. So occasionally we talk now, when I feel I can do so without anger or burnout.\n\nIf you didn't apologize to her, YTA.\n\nIf you did apologize, it's still on you to make up for your shortcomings. You caused pain and resentment in your child, how she processes that isn't on her, it's still what you sowed and now reap.\n\nFind a way to make it right with all three, regardless of their individual trauma response, or you just prove you haven't learned a damn thing by still taking the easy way out.", "NTA.\n\nBut maybe you should've notified her, at least. She probably has issues with you (kinda obvious) since you said you were a shit father when they were young and she was the eldest; she saw the most of your past shittiness.\n\nIt seems like she still seeks some sort of validation or attention from you if she got pissed that you \"left her out\". I think she just put up her wall for so long that she doesn't know how else to treat you. Idk. Maybe have an in-depth talk with her next time you can.", "YTA--- Sounds like you went to a lot of sports events and camping things, did you ever take an interest in your oldest? You said you were a shit father....ever stop to think that she has a lot more memories of the shitty things you did than the other two?

It may not have been ideal that they are all from different households, but it seems like they all know and keep up with each other.  Sounds like you did alright.\n\nHas your daughter always been angry toward you? or is this a recent development? Call your daughter, let her know you care and would like to know why she is so angry.

They experience emotions that they are not equipped to deal with. This really does leave deep psychological scars and affects all areas if their lives long into adulthood.

Im sure it's not fun to listen to for every visit for hours, but maybe this is what she needs to get it out and feel heard and be able to move on, in which case you owe it to her to listen and validate her feelings. Understandable you dont want to do that on the regular but hey it's consequences of your actions and she is clearly still hurting.  \nMaybe she needs more then just this venting to get unstuck, but that advice can probably not come from you and not before letting her vent to you first.", "NTA. Yes, you were an absentee parent and the oldest probably got the worst of it before you came to your senses. \n\nHowever, maintaining a relationship doesn't mean you get to take abuse every time you see your oldest.

The oldest watched him create and vacate from her family plus two more. She saw his attention erode from being oldest to being one of three. That's a lot of instability and turmoil to be forced to endure throughout a childhood and a lot of things he just plain missed while he wasn't engaged in the kids' day-to-day life, like when someone broke her heart, her friends upset her, a teacher was too hard on her, a grade disappointed her or she was sick and needed someone to comfort her.

This is not a bad thing to admit it and I do give you credit for it (its better that you weren't in the first place but that is in the past).  Your oldest seems to be still hurt because of it and you are avoiding the consequence of your past actions instead of managing/addressing it and potentially resolving it both for your oldest daughter and yourself.
