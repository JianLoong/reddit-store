It's important you face that head on, but it's clear she still wants you in her life despite her anger. So, what are you both supposed to do? You need to work on resolving the issue by having a reasonable conversation about your failings and what the parameters of your relationship are going forward. \n\nIt's understandable you don't want to be yelled at over and over again, and the fact that she's not able to see you without yelling isn't good for her either.
