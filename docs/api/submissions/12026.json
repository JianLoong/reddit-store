Robby's in his senior year of high school and he's honestly always been a good kid. I love that little brat.\n\nHowever, last night, I was in the middle of watching cobra kai while Brian was at work. I get a frantic call from Robby. I'll spare the details but he said that he had no money and was in emergency need of Plan B for his girlfriend (F18). He begged me not to tell his parents, and I agreed to it. It's worth noting that he doesn't have a car just yet, and apparently neither does his girlfriend.  The kid was freaking out and screaming on the phone, so I took some time to calm him down and reassure him that his future was not ruined and everything was going to be okay.\n\nI went to the nearby CVS and even bought two Plan Bs in case this happens again in the future, and drove down to Robby. My sister and BIL were out for the night, and Robby couldn't thank me enough. I told him not to mention it and also advised him to stay careful in the future. Robby begged me to keep this between us, and I agreed to spare him embarrassment. Unfortunately, I got an angry call from Lisa this morning, and she had found the other Plan B in Robby's bathroom drawer while she was cleaning the bathroom. She said it was out of line for me to go and do that behind her back, and that I should've told her and Harold. I said that Brian was freaking out and I didn't want to embarrass him or make him feel bad, but Lisa said I was an AH for interfering with her parenting, and that me \"advising him to stay careful in the future\" was an inappropriate thing to say to my own nephew. It's literally gotten to a point where Harold and even a couple of Lisa's friends have been messaging me. I haven't even told Brian about this to keep Robby's word. I wasn't judging him at all, I really was just trying to help. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Wow, I was not expecting the amount of responses so far. I'm about to head to work so I'll update later, but I'm still getting a few more messages. I still haven't responded to a single one, and I still haven't told Brian about this, nor have I contacted Robby. I have no doubt he made a dumb mistake, but I can't deny it, these comments have opened me up to the possibility that Robby isn't getting his proper sex ed or isn't being taught to be properly responsible in these situations. I always knew Lisa and Harold were both weird about talking about all this stuff and the exposure, but now there's a real fear on my end that Robby could end up doing something else by accident. I'm strongly considering giving him the \"talk,\" because clearly no other guardian of his will. I do have mild worries it may feel awkward or uncomfortable for him, and I'm conflicted over how to respond if he ends up asking specific questions or asking about my own experiences. Again, I don't have an issue answering any of these as we're both adults, but I also don't need to be repeatedly shamed or get accused of being inappropriate for this. I will update you all after work.

Also tell L that unless she wants to embarass herself to her son, to stay well out of it as when she shares it with her friends, shes bringing more shame to Robby.

Are they actively wanting Robby to get his 18 year old girlfriend pregnant?\n\nNtA. \n\nHe did the smart thing by contacting a trusted adult to help him with a solution that would change his life forever. He did not wait 4 to 5 months till the belly starts to pop to admit to his mistake. \n\nYour sister could get mad about you not telling her, but to go to the point of involving her friends to harass you over it feels over the top.", "You are not the asshole at all!!

That may have very well opened up a conversation needed in his family, or the girlfriend should have talked to her parents. You violated the trust between you and your BIL and SIL.", "NTA. He's 18 and did the right thing by ringing you. Just be happy he is responsible enough and trusts you enough to tell you rather than go without", "NTA. You did a good thing.

NTA", "NTA Hes an adult.", "NTA\n\nWhat is her parenting style? Get pregnant young and often?\n\nIt's sad your 18 year old nephew has no privacy in his home and is too scared to ask his parents for help. If his parents won't tell him to be careful then someone else has to do it. Pregnancy isn't the only thing that can come from sex and I hope to God he and his girlfriend know that at least. \n\nYou definitely are not the asshole and win an awesome aunt award", "NTA\n\nHe is 18. A full grown adult.", "NTA, at all. \nI would do the same. \n\nHe trust's you thats a huge compliment as well. They made a mistake/something happen and they tried to be responsible. \nSounds like a good kid, young adult. \n\nParents on the other hand,I question them. How come he did not trust them, did not feel save about a question like this.", "> I was an AH for interfering with her parenting,\n\nParents seem to forget that they actually don't control when their kids decide they are ready for sex. Robby is 18, but even if he were younger, if a teen decides they want to be having sex, no amount of rules is going to actually stop them. They won't not have sex just because their parent denied them access to ways to safely have sex.\n\n>that me \"advising him to stay careful in the future\" was an inappropriate thing to say to my own nephew.\n\nIt's literally the most appropriate thing you could've said. Frequent reminders and access to products like condoms and birth control is necessary.\n\nNTA. You helped Robby prevent a pregnancy he and his girlfriend weren't wanting or ready for. That's a good thing.", "NTA. You absolutely did the right thing. Might be a good idea to have a little talk with him at some point about safe sex, but no wonder he went to you and not his parents. Good on you for being there for both of them.", "Oh FFS. The kid is having sex. Parenting has now moved to damage control - that genie ain't going back into the lamp. \n\nIf they called to say \"thanks for helping son, please just give us a heads up so we can have a chat about safe sex\" fine, whatever. \n\nBut what exactly are they bitching about? And to get their friends involved? What the hell is going on? \n\nNTA", "NTA sorry, his mom was clesning his bathroom, and she somhow thinks her son is ready to parent when an accident occurs? Like...what did she expect you to do? Hang up on him? Break his trust so he just knocks her up next time?", "NTA- he\u2019s 18. He\u2019s an adult and how he handles things is none of their business.", "NTA But condoms would have been better than more Plan B", "NTA. You seem like a wonderful uncle and he's lucky to have you. If anyone is the AH, it's Robbys parents. Definitely seems they didn't prepare him well enough for sex. He's lucky to have you, maybe have a talk with him?", "Gently, **YTA.**\n\nAnd I want to be clear, you absolutely are NOT an AH for helping your nephew. You were 100% right for your initial response, to be there for him when he was panicking, and to support his and his girlfriend's responsible decision to address the possibility of an unwanted pregnancy as quickly as possible.\n\nWhere you became TA is in thinking that you were \"helping\" him by agreeing that he could and should hide something like this from his parents because he was embarrassed. I'm not even saying that you should have told them . . . but if you were going to get involved, then you needed to be FULLY and RESPONSIBLY involved, by insisting that HE tell them, giving him a time frame, and explaining that if he didn't, you would. And here's why:\n\nIf your nephew is \"too embarrassed\" to talk to his own parents about a pregnancy scare - if he finds talking about the potential unwanted outcome of sex \"embarrassing\" AT ALL - then he is not enough of an adult to be having sex and taking those risks in the first place. While it is admirable that he called you for help, it also doesn't signify much maturity if his next instinct was \"OMG, my mom and dad can't find out!\" That is not how adults take responsibility for their decisions. And having sex is a very adult decision. \n\nI get that you meant well, and I don't think you're a bad person. But your sister is right . . . you shouldn't have gotten involved with the situation unless you were FULLY PREPARED to talk to your nephew about ALL of the implications and responsibilities . . . not just buy him Plan B and then let him pretend it never happened, which is just likely to lead to something like this happening again in the near future.", "My coworker had to take me to planned parenthood when I was 16 to get me on birth control because my parents sheltered me so intensely. My mom even acted shocked when I took plan B once AFTER I was married and called it \u201cthe abortion pill\u201d. Your nephew knew you were a safe person and came to you for help. You did the right thing helping your adult nephew like this. NTA. Be proud of yourself for being this person.", "NTA he's 18. Plus he obviously felt comfortable asking you over his parents.", "NTA,\n\nThere's a reason he's more comfortable with you than his own parents.", "NTA. The faster a person takes emergency contraception, the better. You did the right thing, and I hope once Robby's mom cools down she will acknowledge that.  \nI do wonder (though it doesn't really make a difference to my judgement):  is Lisa mad because of the Plan B or because she's just discovered Robby's having partner sex with his girlfriend when his parents are out for the evening?", "NTA he trusted you and knew mom would freak. He should have is the other box somewhere and not just left it in the bathroom drawer!!! What a doofus!!! Lol!!!", "NTA.\n\nHe's an adult who asked someone he trusted for help and confided in you. You did nothing wrong. While I can understand why your sister might be upset, I think it's frustration that she's redirecting from her son towards you.", "NTA. You did a good thing.", "NTA - - no matter what age you are and what kind of relationship you have with them, it can be incredibly awkward to talk to your parents about certain issues, particularly around this area. Fear of repercussions, fear of disappointing them, lots of things can make it difficult to start that dialogue.\n\nI applaud you for helping out your nephew and not betraying his confidence. Hopefully this incident may open the way for them all to have a future dialogue", "NTA.  However, if Robby is so afraid of his parents, he needs to smarten up and actually hide the Plan B.  Sticking it in the bathroom drawer wasn\u2019t a good move.  Good on your for supporting your nephew.", "NTA\n\nWould your sister prefer to be a grandma?? Her son is 18. He's going to have sex. Advising him to be careful and helping him when he needs it is just being a supportive family member. I honestly don't understand what she's even mad about.", "NTA. She's probably angry that he trusted you and not his parents. Says a lot about their parenting.", "NTA. If you didn't help your nephew, they maybe would have other unforeseen situations now. He called someone he trusted and you answered his call for help. He's old enough to know who he can ask about this. It's sad for him though that he feels that can't ask his parents for it.", "Definitely not the asshole. You helped someone who needed you. I question how safe and comfortable he feels with his parents if he felt the need to go to you for help in this situation. He\u2019s just a kid being a kid who doesn\u2019t want to raise another kid right now lol. Lisa sounds a little more like the asshole\u2026\u2026.", "NTA.  Your nephew needed immediate help and you gave it to him.  However, his next lesson should probably be how to hide fucking contraband because he didn't even make it 24 hours with the other box.", "NTA.\n\nYour nephew is an adult, not a minor.   He has a right to make his own decisions whether she likes it or not,  If he was underage, then she'd have a valid argument about interfering with parenting.\n\nEdit to add:  I just realized he's still in high school, so in some states he would still be considered a minor (assuming you live in our strange country, USA)  I wouldn't change my judgement even if he is in one of those states, though, as he'd still be close enough that your sister needs to  start recognizing his independence and ability to use good judgement.", "NTA. And I\u2019d reply to every single text with \u201cI\u2019m not sorry, and I\u2019ll do it again\u201d", "Your sister and BIL have been embarrassing their son by telling their friends about what happened?  What the ... ?  I hope the rest of their parenting doesn't suck as badly. Poor kid. No wonder he called you instead of his parents.", "I\u2019d suggest your sister question what it is about her own behaviour that prevented her son coming to his parent in an emergency and further question if she genuinely believes an 18 year old sexually active man is realistically never going to be having sex in future? \n\nNTA: you provided a safe person for your nephew to come to in an emergency - your sisters behaviour ultimately endangers the safety and the potential prosperity of her sons life.  Take him down to the birth control clinic and get him a bloody carrier bag full of free condoms. Tell him not to store them in a shared bathroom.", "NTA, you helped him and his gf. This could have ruined both of their lives and the lives of a child if the worst happened. You Were there when he needed you.", "NTA - this is a time when it's fine to lie.  \"I thought it was Motrin IB.\"  \"It's for a science diorama he was making for school.\"  \"He must have found the box on the sidewalk and was cleaning up litter.\"", "NTA. Your sister should be grateful.", "My thought was did the girlfriend get to make the decision about her body?  And what is her age?", "Poor kid was doing his best to be so vague about it, but it was clearly a case of him breaking it by accident. Hence why I advised him to stay careful in the future (And bought him two of those things).", "Yes! It clearly says a lot that he felt comfortable coming to you and not his parents. Way to go auntie.", "Highly doubt it.", "Thank you so much! I'm glad I was able to help him. Wasn't trying to disrespect my sister at all, just needed to help with a crisis.", "Shouldn't a full grown adult have enough money to buy a Plan B in case something goes wrong ? I'm not saying that he should share absolutely everything with his parents but this attitude of he is 18 he can do whatever he wants while still being reliant on others for housing and money is just wild to me .", "Try telling Lisa that haha. It's like Jesus Christ, I didn't say anything too specific or anything about his business.", "I am severely tempted to give Robby a really serious talk about safe sex, protection, and pulling out because I have the deep underlying suspicion that my sister and BIL aren't really properly educating Robby or trying not to expose it to him. But at this point, I fear that would cause more drama, and I'd only be get further accused of being \"inappropriate.\" But on the other hand, I really do want to be a good aunt. I don't know, I guess you just don't usually hear about aunts giving their nephews the sex talk.", "Na the kid is 18, he doesn't have to tell his parents everything if he doesn't want to. Some parents are unreasonable and judging from this, they sound unreasonable.", "He is 18. It\u2019s not their business with who or how often he has sex. The plan b is for the girlfriend anyway, who is also 18. So it\u2019s even more not the parents business what medication the girl who is not related to them takes. She would actually be the AH for telling the parents.", "I agree with what you're saying about maturity. I've always maintained that anyone who can't buy condoms and get STI tests shouldn't be having sex, and being able to discuss the consequences of sex openly is part of that.\n\nWhere I disagree is that, from the post, it seems like the parents are very judgemental about sex. If OP's nephew is just uncomfortable talking to abstinence-focused parents rather than being embarrassed in general, I think that makes sense.", "Robby's mom sounds like she doesn't believe in plan B. (that's how my parents are too, they think it's an actual abortion to take one) and would probably not have provided Robby with one even if he was open and had asked.", "Even if she won't admit it, I think Lisa is really weirded out about the confirmation that her son is having sex, and she keeps trying to make the argument that I \"overstepped in her parenting\" or \"spoke inappropriately to my nephew.\" I mean I can understand it being somewhat shocking at first, but at the same time, we're all adults. Look, the kid's my nephew that I've watched grow up. I won't deny it was a LITTLE weird when I found out he was finally having intercourse. But at the end of the day, it's something we all do. No reason for it to be weird.", "He's 18, so technically he's an adult, and this isn't even a \"parenting\" issue.", "He will also remember you as a safe place which is invaluable as a kid/young adult.", "Don't put the temptation in my mind haha!", "This. It\u2019s on her if her own kid didn\u2019t feel he could talk to her.", "Ahhh yikes that would've been awkward to try and explain lol but I'm really glad he's being responsible! Thank you for being a good Aunt \ud83d\ude42", "Thank you both for the kind words. Yes, I suspect that Lisa is harboring a jealousy that Robby was going to me for this very private stuff before his own mom. Again, I know Lisa is a little weirder about that stuff, but still.", "He is 18, so he can make adult choices. He made the adult choice that he cannot afford a child. A low income adult still has the right to their own privacy.", "It wouldn't surprise me if he isn't allowed to have a job or if he is allowed to have one isn't allowed free access to his money. I mean, the kid can't even trust that his mother won't go through the drawers. He can't trust them to help him, obviously since he felt he had to call Aunty instead, and judging from OP's post, he can't trust his mother to teach him about safe sex", "him living with his parents and relying on them is a whole different story to him being able to make his own decisions regarding sex", "sounds like a good idea. The way she reacted I also doubt that she taught him anything about how to stay safe. \n\nIt may be uncomfortable/awkward but giving him the sex talk is neccessary", "But didn't Robbie rat you out?\n\nI was going to vote that he is the AH.\n\nI think you need to be very careful getting g involved in his affairs. It is probably going to wind up worse next time.", "The cats already out the bag. I'd go for that serious talk.  Also add in about consent, precum, weight limitations for plan b, abortion/keeping the baby, and that there actually is a wrong way to put a condom on. (So many things!) \n\nMy similarly aged nephew just recently asked me about how to use condoms. I'm states away from him, sigh. I had to send him articles and educational video links. Sometimes we aunts and uncles have to do the job because their parents are too stupid. Thanks for being a great aunt, you've got it!", "Robby is (technically) an adult and his parents don't get to control who has what conversations with him. You would absolutely be doing the right thing by having this talk with him. If his parents want to be dramatic about it, that's on them.", "We're you supposed to say...\"don't have sex anymore\"? Because that works.../s", "Yeah, super true. He has autonomy\u2014 legally being an adult and spiritually/mentally/emotionally being an adult are completely different concepts though. But that said, he still has ever right to make decisions for himself.", "This, and you are definitely NTA", "OP said in post that the mom found the 2nd box in his bathroom drawer. Not really ratting OP out, but if he was concerned enough to not go to parents to get it, he probably should have been more cognizant of where he put it. But 18 years old. Probably didn't think about hiding it better."]}
