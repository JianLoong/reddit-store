She has been attending English classes, but since it\u2019s a group class where most people don\u2019t do their homework, they aren\u2019t making great progress. She has 4 hours of English class + homework per week and doesn\u2019t study outside of that. I\u2019ve been telling her that she needs to study more on her own, or at least to expose herself to various forms of media in English if she wants to improve, but she\u2019s been brushing me off, saying her head would explode if she studied so much. \n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t mind helping her. But it has been a year now, and she still habitually asks me to translate for her. I can understand when it\u2019s something complicated, like calling an insurance company, but oftentimes she will ask me to translate the simplest stuff, like \u201cask her if she\u2019d like some tea\u201d. I don\u2019t think she will ever learn the language if she keeps relying on me instead of putting in the work herself, plus it\u2019s getting tiring for me, too. I know that she can explain herself pretty well when I\u2019m not there to help. She will use hand gestures or make sounds to express herself when she doesn\u2019t know the right words, and people understand her just fine. \n\nI was thinking of telling her that from now on, if she wants to say something to an English speaker, she will have to do it on her own. She can look up the unfamiliar words in her phone and with time, learn the vocabulary she needs to get around. And only if the person really struggles to understand her, then I will translate for her. But I would also feel kinda bad doing it, as she\u2019s a very nice person who\u2019s always ready to help me when I need it. She\u2019s also 45, and says learning new languages is much harder for her because of her age (which I don\u2019t get, 45 is not old IMO).

She moved to a country where she doesn\u2019t speak the language. Just because you\u2019re there doesn\u2019t mean she can use you as a crutch. She needs to keep practicing, even when it\u2019s a small struggle, to improve. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re still willing to help with the truly complicated, hard stuff", "NTA. You have no obligation to be her translator, and sometimes people need a good push to get out of their comfort zone. It\u2019s time she put the work in and at least learn to speak English conversationally", "You should have an honest conversation with your roommate and express your concerns about her overreliance on you for translations.

Also, Google translate, DeepL, and DuoLingo are a thing.", "YWNBTA your position makes sense. She needs to put herself out more, watch movies in English etc.\n\nBut she has a point. Learning a new language when you're older may be harder. I started to learn English in my 30s and today, after years of living in an English - speaking country, I am still soooooo bad at it! I am making grammatical mistakes all the time. And I won't even mention my accent.

She is correct that it is more difficult to learn languages as an adult. After puberty, it gets super hard, actually. It's nice you're willing to translate for her, but she's been there for a year already. You are not her personal translator, Google is. Does she have a learning disability? Because she seems pretty unwilling to learn.", "YWNBTA\n\nI hear everything you both are saying, and being a fish out of water can be very isolating and lonely. \n\nBut it's been a year. What will she do if you want to move in with an SO or get married? \n\nI think TV and movies in English (or whatever language one wants to learn) are a great idea. Duolingo is really good. And I think you should start speaking much more at home in English. She could order some flashcards (or make them, but she doesn't sound too motivated) and plaster them around the house (cabinet, TV, refrigerator, etc...also foods) so she sees them everyday. Your flat will look wacky for a while, but it can help. \n\nGood luck!", "I did suggest it, but she complained that having to talk to others in English was hard enough, and I should just speak our language with her.", "Tell her that forcing herself to speak English with you will improve her English much faster. Speak English to her even if she answers you in the native language.", "NTA she can watch kid's tv and pick up English basics from Sesame Street and the like, and then watch other shows for adults to pick up more, listen to podcasts on subjects of interest, etc. Immersion is the key.", "NTA - I would like to add that I know quiet a few people that have moved to my English speaking country in the last year as their home country is not safe. Some are resistant to learning English because they need to believe they are going home soon. By committing to learning English it's like admitting they will possibly be here for an extended time. \n\nLearning a new lauguage in your 40's is hard, especially if you're not practicing it :) But... there may be other issues going on.\n\nPS. hope you're safe and doing well", "Some thing are really difficult to do if your still learning (like phoning insurance utility etc) but general conversation is her only opportunity to practice, and that is the only way she will learn. I think it\u2019s great you\u2019re helping her but you may need to choose when not to translate to actually help her.", "NTA. It sounds like a difficult situation for her, for sure. I get the sense that there\u2019s probably some trauma regarding your move to the new country, and I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s difficult for her to deal with that and navigating in a new language/culture. And as a 47 year old desperately trying to learn Spanish, I can totally sympathize with her saying it\u2019s harder to learn a language when you\u2019re older! \n\nThat said, you\u2019re completely right, she\u2019s not going to learn if she keeps depending on you. I\u2019m also a former English teacher to immigrants in the US and have seen countless times how students who kept to social circles of just people from their own countries or same language just didn\u2019t really get anywhere with their English. Those that got out of that even a little just had a much easier time in learning English and navigating their lives. \n\nIt is scary - I\u2019m terrified of trying to speak and making mistakes. But it\u2019s really the only way to learn. And what if, god forbid, something happened to you? What would she do then?", "NTA. My cousin\u2019s wife is Brazilian. She\u2019s been here more than 15 years now. First, they lived in an area with a large amount of Brazilians. Then her son was fluent and could interpret for her, as well as her husband. Then she went on to have two more children who can translate for her. She cannot get a driver\u2019s license, so hubby has to chauffeur the kids, handle the school and doctor responsibilities, and handle all the finances.  He does this while battling an auto-immune disease and building a successful business. They have enabled her to almost complete isolation. I\u2019ve known her 15 years, and simply say hi and hug. Bye and hug."]}
