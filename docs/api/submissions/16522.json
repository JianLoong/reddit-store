She has been attending English classes, but since it\u2019s a group class where most people don\u2019t do their homework, they aren\u2019t making great progress. She has 4 hours of English class + homework per week and doesn\u2019t study outside of that. I\u2019ve been telling her that she needs to study more on her own, or at least to expose herself to various forms of media in English if she wants to improve, but she\u2019s been brushing me off, saying her head would explode if she studied so much. \n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t mind helping her. But it has been a year now, and she still habitually asks me to translate for her. I can understand when it\u2019s something complicated, like calling an insurance company, but oftentimes she will ask me to translate the simplest stuff, like \u201cask her if she\u2019d like some tea\u201d. I don\u2019t think she will ever learn the language if she keeps relying on me instead of putting in the work herself, plus it\u2019s getting tiring for me, too. I know that she can explain herself pretty well when I\u2019m not there to help. She will use hand gestures or make sounds to express herself when she doesn\u2019t know the right words, and people understand her just fine. \n\nI was thinking of telling her that from now on, if she wants to say something to an English speaker, she will have to do it on her own. She can look up the unfamiliar words in her phone and with time, learn the vocabulary she needs to get around. And only if the person really struggles to understand her, then I will translate for her. But I would also feel kinda bad doing it, as she\u2019s a very nice person who\u2019s always ready to help me when I need it. She\u2019s also 45, and says learning new languages is much harder for her because of her age (which I don\u2019t get, 45 is not old IMO).

Also, Google translate, DeepL, and DuoLingo are a thing.", "YWNBTA your position makes sense. She needs to put herself out more, watch movies in English etc.\n\nBut she has a point. Learning a new language when you're older may be harder. I started to learn English in my 30s and today, after years of living in an English - speaking country, I am still soooooo bad at it! I am making grammatical mistakes all the time. And I won't even mention my accent.

She is correct that it is more difficult to learn languages as an adult. After puberty, it gets super hard, actually.

What will she do if you want to move in with an SO or get married? \n\nI think TV and movies in English (or whatever language one wants to learn) are a great idea. Duolingo is really good. And I think you should start speaking much more at home in English. She could order some flashcards (or make them, but she doesn't sound too motivated) and plaster them around the house (cabinet, TV, refrigerator, etc...also foods) so she sees them everyday.
