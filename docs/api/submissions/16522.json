She has been attending English classes, but since it\u2019s a group class where most people don\u2019t do their homework, they aren\u2019t making great progress. She has 4 hours of English class + homework per week and doesn\u2019t study outside of that. I\u2019ve been telling her that she needs to study more on her own, or at least to expose herself to various forms of media in English if she wants to improve, but she\u2019s been brushing me off, saying her head would explode if she studied so much. \n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t mind helping her. But it has been a year now, and she still habitually asks me to translate for her. I can understand when it\u2019s something complicated, like calling an insurance company, but oftentimes she will ask me to translate the simplest stuff, like \u201cask her if she\u2019d like some tea\u201d. I don\u2019t think she will ever learn the language if she keeps relying on me instead of putting in the work herself, plus it\u2019s getting tiring for me, too. I know that she can explain herself pretty well when I\u2019m not there to help. She will use hand gestures or make sounds to express herself when she doesn\u2019t know the right words, and people understand her just fine. \n\nI was thinking of telling her that from now on, if she wants to say something to an English speaker, she will have to do it on her own. She can look up the unfamiliar words in her phone and with time, learn the vocabulary she needs to get around. And only if the person really struggles to understand her, then I will translate for her. But I would also feel kinda bad doing it, as she\u2019s a very nice person who\u2019s always ready to help me when I need it. She\u2019s also 45, and says learning new languages is much harder for her because of her age (which I don\u2019t get, 45 is not old IMO).

She needs to keep practicing, even when it\u2019s a small struggle, to improve. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re still willing to help with the truly complicated, hard stuff", "NTA. You have no obligation to be her translator, and sometimes people need a good push to get out of their comfort zone. It\u2019s time she put the work in and at least learn to speak English conversationally", "You should have an honest conversation with your roommate and express your concerns about her overreliance on you for translations.

Also, Google translate, DeepL, and DuoLingo are a thing.", "YWNBTA your position makes sense. She needs to put herself out more, watch movies in English etc.\n\nBut she has a point. Learning a new language when you're older may be harder. I started to learn English in my 30s and today, after years of living in an English - speaking country, I am still soooooo bad at it!

She is correct that it is more difficult to learn languages as an adult. After puberty, it gets super hard, actually. It's nice you're willing to translate for her, but she's been there for a year already. You are not her personal translator, Google is. Does she have a learning disability? Because she seems pretty unwilling to learn.", "YWNBTA\n\nI hear everything you both are saying, and being a fish out of water can be very isolating and lonely. \n\nBut it's been a year. What will she do if you want to move in with an SO or get married? \n\nI think TV and movies in English (or whatever language one wants to learn) are a great idea. Duolingo is really good. And I think you should start speaking much more at home in English. She could order some flashcards (or make them, but she doesn't sound too motivated) and plaster them around the house (cabinet, TV, refrigerator, etc...also foods) so she sees them everyday. Your flat will look wacky for a while, but it can help. \n\nGood luck!", "I did suggest it, but she complained that having to talk to others in English was hard enough, and I should just speak our language with her.", "Tell her that forcing herself to speak English with you will improve her English much faster. Speak English to her even if she answers you in the native language.", "NTA she can watch kid's tv and pick up English basics from Sesame Street and the like, and then watch other shows for adults to pick up more, listen to podcasts on subjects of interest, etc. Immersion is the key.", "NTA - I would like to add that I know quiet a few people that have moved to my English speaking country in the last year as their home country is not safe. Some are resistant to learning English because they need to believe they are going home soon. By committing to learning English it's like admitting they will possibly be here for an extended time. \n\nLearning a new lauguage in your 40's is hard, especially if you're not practicing it :) But... there may be other issues going on.\n\nPS. hope you're safe and doing well", "Some thing are really difficult to do if your still learning (like phoning insurance utility etc) but general conversation is her only opportunity to practice, and that is the only way she will learn. I think it\u2019s great you\u2019re helping her but you may need to choose when not to translate to actually help her.", "NTA. It sounds like a difficult situation for her, for sure. I get the sense that there\u2019s probably some trauma regarding your move to the new country, and I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s difficult for her to deal with that and navigating in a new language/culture. And as a 47 year old desperately trying to learn Spanish, I can totally sympathize with her saying it\u2019s harder to learn a language when you\u2019re older! \n\nThat said, you\u2019re completely right, she\u2019s not going to learn if she keeps depending on you. I\u2019m also a former English teacher to immigrants in the US and have seen countless times how students who kept to social circles of just people from their own countries or same language just didn\u2019t really get anywhere with their English. Those that got out of that even a little just had a much easier time in learning English and navigating their lives. \n\nIt is scary - I\u2019m terrified of trying to speak and making mistakes. But it\u2019s really the only way to learn. And what if, god forbid, something happened to you? What would she do then?", "NTA. My cousin\u2019s wife is Brazilian. She\u2019s been here more than 15 years now. First, they lived in an area with a large amount of Brazilians. Then her son was fluent and could interpret for her, as well as her husband. Then she went on to have two more children who can translate for her. She cannot get a driver\u2019s license, so hubby has to chauffeur the kids, handle the school and doctor responsibilities, and handle all the finances.  He does this while battling an auto-immune disease and building a successful business. They have enabled her to almost complete isolation. I\u2019ve known her 15 years, and simply say hi and hug. Bye and hug.", "NTA. Most large companies (think utilities, insurance of any kind, health care companies, even government at all levels, etc) have access to a translation service by phone so long as she can say the name of her language in English. While your roommate is correct that learning a new language past a certain age becomes more difficult (that age is around 12-13; it\u2019s a development thing), it is not impossible. Depending on what your native language is, English can be one of the most difficult languages to learn. The thing to keep in mind is that she will not learn the language if she does not use it. Tell her all of this when you let her know that you translating for her all the time is just too exhausting to keep doing.", "This may be an NAH or a Not AH.  I'm going with the Benign judgement as you don't express her being nasty about all this.\n\nHowever, have you considered instead of translating for her, Telling her that from now on you two will only speak English in the apartment so she gets daily practice.-immersion teaching.\n\nThis would help her(since you say the classes aren't much help).  If she refuses, then you WNBTA to refuse to continue translating for her, because she's REFUSING to take responsibility for her own needs.\n\nI don't know when you learned English, but Generally the younger you learn a language, the easier it is(ie from birth--when still learning the phonemes of each language very easy). Learning before age 12 easier.  Learning as an adult, generally much harder.", "NTA. \n\nI'm a fan of firm love. It's good to be there for complicated conversations, but at this point, she really should learn how to get through day to day life without you. She needs to be more independent and already has the classes under her belt, so she needs to practice in real life. It's going to be hard at first so she'll have to suck it up and push through, but she'll eventually get better and her confidence will go up and then she'll be fine. Remove the training wheels/crutches/hand-holding/etc because it's not doing her any favors in the long run.", "NTA. She\u2019s correct that it gets harder to learn languages as you get older, but it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do it, just that you have to keep at it. And if you don\u2019t, you won\u2019t get anywhere at all. So if you were to keep translating, she would have no incentive to learn. And then what happens when you walk in front of a bus?", "NTA there is google or translater apps she can download.", "Maybe she feels self-conscious about her lower level of English. Maybe it's not a \"lazy\" or unwillingness thing, but embarrassment? Perhaps it would be better if you both speak English at home when no one else is around. When she struggles to find the word or phrase in English she can say it in your native language and you can teach her the English phrase.\n\nPractice is important in learning any language. If she's just going to classes and never using it practically, she's not going to be anywhere near fluent - like ever. \n\nWhat happens when you are no longer around? I assume you have life plans for yourself and won't be willing to just drop everything to help her when those come to fruition?\n\nNTA, but be gentle. And have some plans (e.g., Tuesdays and Thursdays are English days in the house).", "I lived abroad for a year and had to learn to navigate stores and basic social interactions.\n\nIt's not that hard. I would tend to perhaps give her a list of useful phrases, \"Would you like...? Where can I find...? I would like a coffee with milk, no sugar/beer/cider/tea...\" Whatever seems to be a likely useful phrase with some typical responses, so she understands the answers.", "And, she can use something like google translate. Which could also help her practice how to say things as well if she wants to be able to communicate in English. I won't say English is easy, but as with anything you have to be willing to learn it.", "I moved to a country where I needed to learn the language, as an adult. I'm not great with languages, but if you're going to live there, you need to invest the effort.\n\nFor the first few months, I studied or had lessons 3-4 hours a day. I watched television in the language, listened to the radio, etc..\n\nIf she won't, she will always be an outsider. She should go back to her home country. Oh, it's dangerous? Then invest the effort. Otherwise, I have zero sympathy for her.", "NTA", "NTA I'm not sure if it's true but supposedly you can learn english from watching english tv shows. Probably need a bit more outside help than just that but I have heard multiple times on the internet that is how some people learned it or it helped them pick it up faster.", "Given the timeline, it's very likely that they're war refugees, so \"moved to a country where she doesn't speak the language\" means nothing, as it was not really their choice.", "Google translate is for exactly this.  My friend is a refugee who speaks another language, trying to learn English (and it IS harder as an adult).  We can do the basics together in English, anything more complicated and the phrase gets popped into GT on our phones."]}
