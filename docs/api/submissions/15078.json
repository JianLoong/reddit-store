He has a 15 year old son Lucas. Lucas' mom died when he was 5 years old. I came into our marriage with Brynn who is 11 now and Miley who is 9. Together my husband and I have Alec who is 5. So Brynn and Miley are Lucas' stepsisters and Alec is his half brother.\n\nLucas has this trinket box with a couple of small trinkets inside of it that his mom left for him when she died. He keeps it in his room mostly but he likes to sometimes walk around with it in his hand. I have always told my kids it is not theirs, they are not to touch it unless Lucas says they can and they cannot pester him about it. When we first got married Miley was really fascinated with it and did want to touch it but I nipped it in the bud since it was so special.\n\nRegarding the dynamic. Lucas is very closed off from me and the kids. I have always done my best to bond with him but he is so withdrawn around me and therapy, which we did when we first got married, did not get us onto a path of being close, though I never expected to be his mom and I don't want that considered.\n\nAbout a month ago were having dinner and my husband cracked a joke that Lucas seemed to care more about the trinket box than us after Lucas refused to let Alec get a closer look at it. Lucas said, very seriously, that the box meant more than me and the kids and he would gladly trade us to save the box if anything happened to it. My husband was shocked Lucas spoke so seriously and the girls got upset about it. Alec wasn't paying attention when it was said. My husband took Lucas aside to speak to him and I spoke to the girls. They told me Lucas had said that before, that he would trade our lives to save his box, that we better hope he's never asked to save one of us or the box because the box would win. He said this to them on a few occasions over a period of time. They never told me because they didn't know how to bring it up. He told Alec the same as well.\n\nMy husband said Lucas would need some therapy because he saw nothing wrong with saying that honestly. I told him he was saying it and more to the kids when we didn't overhear. My husband said therapy would get to the bottom of things. A few days later Lucas is telling Brynn that he'd save his friends over the box but not her. I told my husband about it and he said it would be mentioned to the therapist (he had a consultation with one the next day). Lucas argued that he didn't need therapy and just because he doesn't care about us or our lives doesn't mean there is something wrong with him.\n\nI told my husband that given Lucas' attitude toward the kids, they will no longer show up to cheer him on at any sport games or the like. My husband argued we are still a family. I told him my kids do not need to cheer on the boy who has told them to their faces multiple times that their lives are meaningless to him. My husband thinks I am overreacting and I would be wrong to do this.

I do suggest therapy though.", "Why the fuck does this topic of saving someone over the box keep popping up like that ?\n\nESH, execpt the kids.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like this toxic environnement was brought by the adults. You husband comment during dinner should never have happened. Why would you ask something like that to a teenager who is clearly missing his mother ?\n\nTherapy is not going to change the fact that the 15 year old misses his mother, does not see you and your kids as his family and that you actually don't know what he would do if a crazy scenario actuallu happened.\n\nI could tell you that if there was a fire, I would risk my life to save a stranger. Truth is, I have never been in this situation and I don't know how I would react. And I'm thirty fucking two. Your SS is fucking 15. Just leave him the fuck alone, and let your kids the choice to go or not to his games.", "NTA (I feel like I\u2019m going to get a lot of flack for this)\n\nMortality is hard on kids. It really really really sucks that your stepson is struggling so much with his mother\u2019s passing/family blending, but that doesn\u2019t give him the right to continually bully and deride other children. If this was happening in a school setting, where a kid was telling other kids their lives are meaningless to them blah blah blah, that would be very not okay.\n\nTeaching your kids boundaries is important. Forcing them to go to his events after he speaks repeatedly like that (which clearly upsets them) is teaching them that their feelings don\u2019t matter. There are consequences to all actions and despite his grief, it\u2019s not an excuse to mistreat others. \n\nIt also might help for them not to go, giving him a little more space to adjust if it\u2019s just his dad + stepmom. Right now he\u2019s struggling to adjust to the new family dynamic and the full frontal of that at every event might be making him more bitter. Maybe with therapy and time, he\u2019ll request they come, maybe not. Maybe he\u2019ll apologize and try harder to get to know them. But a little breathing room actually seems to be what he needs (even if he\u2019s lashing out and getting it the wrong way).", "Oh I'm going to be down-voted hard.. \nI say give him some space while simultaneously protecting your children at the same time. \n\nMaybe a couple of games? Then if he says anything you can be honest, I feel like you've made it clear my kids just do your head in, I assumed you don't want them there but they absolutely want to be, so if you would like them to come, absolutely, otherwise just myself and your dad can come and support you. Whatever your more comfortable with. \n\nBesides therapy, maybe you sit down with him and really talk to him, maybe explain that you do understand that his mum means everything to him and you don't want to be a fill in mum, that you do love and care about him and you love his dad. That your willing to give him the space that he wants if it's what he really wants. That you understand that coming in, marrying his dad, bringing two kids in the mix and then another one is alot and you get it but you'd like to find a middle ground and you'll respect what it is but he doesn't have to remind the kids they don't mean anything, that's been made clear but you hope at some point that changes because they love him. You all do. And tell him I have made it more then clear that box is irreplaceable and yours and yours alone. They will not ever touch it. \n\nHe may feel everyone is being forced on him but you do have to worry about your kids too, they have come into a new family and also got two more siblings and one can't stand the sight of them and that's gotta hurt too. \n\nDad should not of made that joke.", "INFO: has he hurt the girls? I get he says hurtful things, but has he been threatening or physically hurt them?", "He\u2019s not choosing the box over you guys. He\u2019s choosing his mom over you guys. Be kind to him pls. You\u2019ll will have a very different relationship if you react with love than anger", "NAH\n\nThis is a very difficult situation and I sympathise with everybody. \n\nLucas is dealing with very complex issues which have resulted in complex feelings and attitudes towards the rest of the family, he probably has no idea how to manage the pain and grief he is experiencing and needs help with this, therapy is the right move for him. \n\nHowever, regardless of what is going on with him, saying he does not care about the lives of you and your other children is concerning and something that needs to be addressed. Your other children are being hurt by what he is saying and their feelings are just as important. I think you are right it is unfair to have their feelings put aside to cheer him on at a sport event if this is going to cause them further upset. \n\nYour husband is trying to help Lucas and keep the family together so is being pulled in both directions which is a very hard position to be in,  so I see how this is also a difficult decision for him to make. \n\nHave you thought about family therapy, this could help you all work through theese issues together without the other kids feelings being pushed aside and without Lucas feeling abandoned by you not being at his sporting events?", ">my husband cracked a joke that Lucas seemed to care more about the trinket box than us\n\nThis was not a joke, just cruel.\n\n>I told my husband that given Lucas' attitude toward the kids, they will no longer show up to cheer him on at any sport games or the like\n\nLe what am I reading here. \n\n\n\nYTA and a big time. Honestly I am not surprised that Lucas values his little box more than his family.\nHe lost his mom at a young age, that alone is already effecting his life till this day. And every time he opens up, nothing gets done about it or he gets punished by giving him no support.\n\nThe help he needs, doesnt he get from the adults who should take care of him.", "Mann this is a really sad situation tbh. I don't think you're the asshole persay because ofc you will be defensive over your kids but maybe Lucas thinks you replaced his mother and that's why he's being a brat?\nAlso yeah he's old enough and it's not fair for him to behave so childish but he lost his mum and that's the only reminder of her", "NTA.   \nYour children are the priority. Lucas has decided he wants no part in your lives. Give him his wish.", "NTA and tell your husband to take the box to get to cheer for him. Seems like its more important than family, so I see nothing wrong with you or the kids wanting to stay away from someone who doesn't have the family on his list of priorities. Also do keep an eye out for your kids as he seems to be someone who is lost in his own world and may lead to more issues later on.", "Obviously the box, in a way, replaced his mother. He sees her in it. And, of course, in his mind, it will come first, as he sees his mom in it.\n\nI would say YTA for the simple fact that I highly doubt that, if one of your own kids said something similar to what he said  to another of your kids, you would take the same approach and retract the support of one to the other.\n\nYou are clearly singling him out for not being blood related to you or your kids. And that will just drive the wedge even further between \"your family\" and him, and even his dad.\n\nThe dude is 15, you have to be better than this.\n\nEdit: I am not saying what he is doing is right and should be encouraged. I am saying it should be understood and dealt with in a reasonable and healthy way, taking into account he is a teenager that most probably has some very real issues that will not solve itself in one or two years of therapy. He needs nurturing, love and understanding, not scolding and isolation.", "YTA - He's just a boy, he lost his mother, and misses her a lot. He's in pain and dealing with it the only way he knows how. That box might as well be a part of his mother. Yes, he's dealing with it poorly, but you're still being petty over it and not understanding what he's dealing with. He might not even understand either. He's just a child and you're an adult. Your reaction to it is only going to push a wedge further between him and everyone. Therapy is going to take time.", "NAH. Lucas obviously has issues. However, he also doesn't have a fully developed frontal lobe and he lost his mother very young. Withdrawal would only damage him more. You are hurt,, the kids don't understand, but you are an adult and the only mother he has. If he were biologically yours you wouldn't abandon him for this.", "[deleted]", "This doesn't seem like the right sub for this. The post is 6 paragraphs long, and only the last one mentions the sport games. Honestly though, if after all of that the concern is specifically sport games, then YTA. It's one thing to say 'let's all give each other some space' and another to say 'they're not cheering for you at the game for a while'.", "YTA. His father has failed him, and you're actively making it worse. Why don't you ask your husband why he felt the need to make that particular \"joke\" towards his son?\n\nI don't think it was a joke at all. It reads much more like his father is annoyed that he hasn't gotten over the death of his mother yet. \n\nYou've repeatedly said you don't try or expect to be his mother, but I'm not convinced you're being completely truthful. You seem resentful to my mind, whether you realise it or not.\n\nIt's good that the child is in therapy. I think you and your husband need it too.", "Sounds like the boy has issues. You should be there for him.", "YTA you're definitely overreacting and being insensitive. Responding by pulling away and threatening to cause problems between Lucas and his siblings is only making the problem worse. Honestly I would drop the whole situation and go on with life, rather than getting upset over how a 15 year old thinks he would handle a hypothetical crisis that has almost no likelihood of ever occuring", "Every comment has had an automatic deflection fom OP which seems telling. \n\nI also notice all the time OP refers to her biological children as \"my kids\". I can see why the 15 year old resents you and \"your kids\" so much.", "You are over reacting.\n\nThe boy is clearly saying things because he feels insecure about his position within a family that he\u2019s largely not blood related. People say things they don\u2019t mean. Even hurtful things. I would guess he\u2019s been very jealous with all his step siblings. And he\u2019s been living with it everyday. What parents should do is not take things personal but understand what\u2019s making their children say things.", "YTA you should be the adult not acting like a child, all you're doing is pushing him further away", "NAH! This seems to be a heartbreaking situation and im so glad you are going for therapy. Perhaps consult with the therapist about what the best solution would be. As long as you are still going to go for his games and cheer for him and love him even though he shows that he doesnt need you i think letting your kids skip the games is fine. To me it seems like after their brother has repeatedly expressed how little he values them or cares for them making them attend his games would be a harmful message to them. They are also children in this situation and teaching them to enable someones bad behaviour would be a wrong lesson. But you as an adult still need to be there for him and perhaps you and your husband can attend family therapy with them and bring the other kids in if and when needed. All the kids in this situation need to be considered", "YWBTA if you go down that path.\n\nNow don't get me wrong I get that this hurts and Lucas needs to learn to shut it instead of saying these things out loud.\n\nHowever he's 15 and the \"I would friends but not all of you\" is clearly a pubescent way to stick it and be rude. I mean which teenager hasn't said hatefull things to it's parents/siblings? Either way he is being honest and he's allowed to value others and other things over anyone else and so are you. But if you really/honestly want to be what you always tried to be, then be the adult and better person in this situatie and kill him with kindness. If you don't go cheer him on, don't do it out of spite.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NOW they\u2019re in the process of getting him in therapy after this incident - so I don\u2019t consider that accommodation.

And yes regardless  of his age if he goes around constantly telling your kids I'd rather you die than lose my box he is abusing them emotionally.  He doesn't get a free pass because he has trauma. He needs therapy and to learn when the shut up. \n\nHe does not have to care about or even love your children. Hell he can even feel how he wants about his box. This issue is his need to let your children know their place (which is in his mind better off dead) consistently.  \n\nI have people in my family I don't particularly  care about   but can you image if I called them up every now and again and said \"hey just a reminder I could give a shit if you die\" \n\nHe can feel how he feels but he cannot sit there and fuck you kids up mentally just to make himself feel better.  \n\nInfo:But before I can give a judegement I need to know what do the other kids want?

I hope he finds healing and you find some peace.", "You sound like a great stepmom \nRespecting the boundaries and understanding his position\n\nBut your other kids need you to protect them - unfortunately right now it\u2019s from him. \n\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing - abuse and bullying should never be acceptable even if the person is family and has their own problems.", "What has his dad done? Does he talk to Lucas about his mum? maybe Lucas feels like his dad has forgotten about his mum!?\n\nI can understand where you're coming from, you don't want your kid D's to be upset. It sounds like you've respected his boundaries.\n\nHopefully therapy will help him and unearth any issues you may not be aware of.", "He's not joking.", "I love how you only direct the frustration against your son for the situation. If this is the way you guys treat him, no wonder he hates you.", "You\u2019re upset that your kids are hurt that your stepson is grieving his mother?", "Of course they don't deserve to be talked to like that. I am not condoning it, all I am saying is that the way things are being handled, IMO, will just make things worst for everyone. The kids will drift even more apart, Lucas will feel even more isolated, and things will escalate.\n\nThis situation clearly needs the help of professionals, and it will not solve itself with just a few sessions. That'll be years of therapy (solo and family).\n\nAgain, as I see it, Lucas is not comparing the box to the other kids, but to his mom. Clearly the box, to him, represents the embodiment of his deceased mother, and it seems he feels a very deep sorrow, sadness and loneliness that the box somehow can somehow make it better.\n\nIt is a very complex situation, and segregating the kids, who all live in the same house, will not, again IMO (and I have no professional experience with this whatsoever, so take my words as you may, and most people seen to disagree with me, and thst is fine) help anyone.", "I'm amazed at your cool responses to these comments \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Did you even ask him if he wants you or your children there to begin with? Once he goes off to college you most likely won't see him aside from when he sees his father if he dislikes you and your children as much as you claim.", "Your SS probably does dislike them, although hate may be too strong a word. He may see his siblings as a way to make up for his mother as well as you. I agree u should keep ur kids away from his games and i think maybe having them stay away from each other a bit more would be better and letting him come around to them when hes more mature and older would be the best idea.", "Jeez people in this thread are really harsh.. the kid has issues, yes, that he needs to address. But that doesn't excuse repeatedly bullying his step siblings. I don't understand why people can't see that.. bullying is awful for little kids and their mental wellbeing (it can really cause long term issues more than with adults). You're totally right for wanting to protect the other kids from his bullying. No one is an asshole IMO - just a messy situation.", "Neither does Lucas. Everybody wins!", "Still the same situation, that\u2019s not fixing anything.", "Why were you forcing them to go in the first place?", "I am researching therapists for my children as well.", ">Start opening the box  at this point\n\nAbsolutely fucking do not do this.", "Excellent advice. \n\nYou have a very hurt child who needs you to prove that no matter how he tries to push you away, you won't actually go. Instead of taking your children and 'abandoning him', you really need to continue to support him.\n\nI will say however, that you also need to listen to your other children. Explain that Lucas is hurting a lot and that whilst he is saying things that sounds awful, it is due to the pain and loss he is continuing to experience. Encourage them to continue to show support, but do not force them. If they are upset and want some distance, then they absolutely should be given this. \n\nSounds like all of you need to go to therapy. You and your partner especially, because you need to be able to work out your feelings without putting them on your children.\n\nYTA", "My sentiments exactly. And so eloquently put.", "All of this. Tell stories of his mum. Keep her alive by sharing memories. He deserves that. My heart breaks for this poor kid. I don't blame him for what he said and I completely understand it. There's nothing wrong with him. *That box* is ALL he has of his mother. That's it. And he's got a family who treats her death like a curiosity or a joke, or who show signs of having moved on completely. Maybe it would be good for him to know his father still misses her and thinks about her too. If I were him, I'd only save the box too.", "This was my first thought. He\u2019s a kid who lost his mum. Him being scared of losing other family members would be entirely reasonable.", "Tbh at this stage, I would be very surprised if he had any organic memories of his mother- and if he did, I\u2019d be surprised if they\u2019re at all concrete. It makes sense that he wants to keep those at all costs.", "Yeah sorry I was probably being too crass there - I completely agree with you there\u2026 \n\nHaving lost my mum - I get it - her things are soooo important to me especially as we don\u2019t have the house she was last in anymore. However, yeah we have pictures everywhere but the momentos are very valuable, yet at no point would I try and diminish someone\u2019s existence for those. Only exception if they were challenging and devaluing it and trying to erase my mother.\n\nMay be videos and discussing these things so he can still feel connected and not like he\u2019s betraying her memory by allowing others to love him in a similar manner", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s saying it \u201call the time,\u201d like unprovoked. I get the sense it\u2019s only when they talk about the box.", "Therapy doesn't help everyone. Not everyone reacts well to therapy. In this case, the therapy seems to be punitive and forcing him to go would be a waste of their money.", "It is only around the box as far as I know/am aware of at present.", "There are pictures of her and their family from when she was alive around the house. I do my best to show him I love him but I am aware that our relationship is not very close. But I have always done my best and try to show him respect and love at the same time, by honoring what is important to him and teaching the other kids to do the same.", "Caring about his friends likely doesn\u2019t feel like replacing his mother. Caring about the family that he has and only has because his mother DIED probably does feel like replacing his mother, and he probably feels very guilty for feeling like he\u2019s replacing her.", "If he\u2019s got enough rage and doesn\u2019t feel his dad is on his side, it could come out. \n\nHe may actually be happy to not have them at the games, to be honest", "Would you want your kids to be around a someone who's been emotionally abusing them? Because that's what Lucas is doing.", "The other kids could just as easily drift from their parents because they subjected them to a bully their whole lives and didn\u2019t do anything to protect them", "Oh yeah, that kid\u2019s going NC the second he turns 18", "Bullying has a cause and it starts with the parents, be it through action or inaction. Inaction in this case. No one is excusing the boy's actions, they're admonishing his guardians for letting a kid who clearly has issues just fester in to a hateful, cold teenager.", "You and your husband need family therapy he is not getting to that point by itself", "And for yourself,  right? Because it's a family dynamic issue, and you're a major part of the family.", ">I am researching therapists for my children as well.\n\nSo... everyone except you?  And your husband?\n\nIt's not just the children who need therapy.  You and your husband helped create and foster this dynamic.  You're part of the issue here to be blunt.\n\nAnd don't try to claim you're in therapy because no reasonable therapist is going to support your idea that when a hurting teen says something lashing out at younger step/half siblings the best way to fix that is to retaliate by not supporting him.  If you're in therapy, you need another therapist.", "Why didn\u2019t therapy work for YOU the first time around, directly after the marriage? Why did you stop going?", "So NO than.\n\nWhy cant the same therapist see you all ( individually and as a group).", "Seems you feel people shouldn't rock the boat eh? I honestly doubt her children would want to support someone who views them as ants.", "Please ask your husband, just to get an idea of how much danger your children are actually in, if at all. If it's just trauma he is trying to process, it's unpleasant but probably not a major concern. If this is a common theme, then it needs to be addressed ASAP.", "Yeah my first thought was that\u2019s probably gonna be a huge relief for him.", "You don\u2019t have to let them treat you badly, but you do have to try to understand and help them when they are in hellish pain. THATS the lesson you\u2019re teaching. \n\nHe blames you and the siblings for his mom being gone, and for whatever part of his subconscious is recognizing that he doesn\u2019t remember as much. He might not fully realize it on a conscious level yet. You need to love him through and do everything you can to help him remember, to show him love isn\u2019t a finite resource and you (and he) can love more than one person. If you had a child pass away, and had another baby, you wouldn\u2019t love the one you lost any less, just like his dad loving you doesn\u2019t mean he loves his wife that passed away any less.\n\nI\u2019m assuming you haven\u2019t contributed to this and aren\u2019t one of those vile jealous selfish idiots who comes in and demands pictures of their deceased parent are removed, the house redecorated, their name not mentioned, etc. but keeping photos out etc is just the obvious baseline of common sense for what you should do coming into a home/family with this kind of loss. Do more: remember her birthday with a cake, her passing with flowers on her grave and a PRIVATE (unless he wants to share) letter to his mom left on her gravestone. Ask him and his father about his memories and do your best to keep those memories alive, what perfume did she wear? Did she make pancakes? Did she take him fishing? Was their favorite game? (At that age probably tickle and chase of some kind). Did she have a silly name for farts? These questions should be part of normal routines, heavy for awhile and then finding a sort of groove that stays with you forever. \n\nKeeping his love for his mother alive will make him love YOU. Be the one that does that for him.", "And what therapist would suggest subjecting even smaller children to abuse?", "I am not in therapy yet but I want to prioritize the kids being in therapy first.", "He's not a child tho. He's 15. He's months away from having responsibilities like driving a car. But mostly, although you can be naive and emotional at 15, telling people you would trade a box over their live is something you know you *don't* do. He's not a baby! At 15 you slam doors and yell at your parents, you don't tell kids you wish they died. Even if you think that, you have enough common sense to keep it for yourself.\nYou know who are actually children? Op's other children. Not Lucas. He's a teen.", "Yeah she doesn\u2019t love him tho.", "If you want to prioritize the children for money issues I get it. Good parenting.\nBut if it's because you thing they need it more, WRONG.\n\nAlso look for family therapy together (if you have the money).", "Wrong approach. You should all be in therapy. You can\u2019t help others if you are not helping yourself first.  This isn\u2019t a situation of Nothing is wrong with me.  The kid (who lost his Mom) is broken, so fix him.  This is a situation of I am the adult and want to support/help my whole family, and we all need help. Starting with me", "But you are not a therapist, let the therapists decide who needs therapy first.\n\nThis is a family dynamic issue, and unlike loading groceries you can't cut it in parts and do part 1 first, than part 2.\n\nDo it right or therapy is not helpful.", "So you keep telling the kids that there's something wrong with them..... \n\nConsidering that you keep lying about \"nipping issues in the bud\" then what else are you lying about?   If you had actually nipped the box issue ***your children have by wanting to see it*** then this wouldn't be an issue.", "Whenever something is wrong/bothersome with the kids, always start therapy with the parent first. The parent is the first step.", "Bad idea. You clearly need it too", "No, you need help talking to the kids. How you frame a situation is everything when talking to kids, you can turn a good situation into a bad sitution and vice versa with a few wrong or right words", "15 is still considered a child, both in social terms AND in terms of brain development. They are not capable of giving consent, they aren't capable of making sound decisions and they aren't capable of thinking beyond the emotions of which you speak. This child lost his mother at a young age and presumably is feeling that increasingly as he goes through pubescence. Is he wrong? Absolutely. Should he suffer adult consequences? No. The other children in the home, however, DO need to be protected from him while they get him treated for the trauma he appears to be suffering.", "No he's literally a teenager, not a child. You're acting like he's not capable of understanding the effect that his words have on others. He knows pretty well. As I said, he's not really a child. I wonder if you know any 15 yo. And I'm not saying he should suffer adult consequences.\n However, being denied attention from younger siblings you're hurting *isn't* adult consequences. An adult child would probably be kicked out for messing with actually kid siblings like this, and rightfully! Of course a 15 shouldn't be denied to live in his house. But he's also not a kid you have to enable in this kind of behaviour.", "Firstly, OP removed her kids from a toxic situation that the stepson was creating and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. She also stated that she would continue to support him so i don\u2019t know where u got the throw in the towel analogy from. Secondly, u cant just put some in therapy just cause u feel like it, the kid need to be receptive to the therapy otherwise it is of no use. OP did her best with what she could for the step son, she didn\u2019t impose she asked her kids to be respectful of her stepson. What more is there for her to do?", "I'm mother to three sons who are now grown and have an MSN in nursing. I know very well of which I speak, having both been through it and having studied psychology and the lifespan extensively.\n\nI didn't advocate that the siblings be forced to spend time with him or at his games. In fact, I said NOT requiring them to was reasonable. It would be reasonable even if he were not acting like this.", "Honestly, if OP really wanted to take her kids out of a toxic situation, she would move out. All she\u2019s doing is not allowing her children to support the stepson at supervised events. That reasoning alone makes 0 sense for her case, it literally doesn\u2019t do anything except make the stepson feel even more divided. A child can totally be unresponsive to therapy, but obviously they are willing to give it another try after 8 years of nothing, so they most definitely COULD have started sooner or kept trying when he was 7 instead of removing him from it. OP doesn\u2019t hesitate to correct people that she will never be his mother and doesn\u2019t even want to be compared to a mother FIGURE (as seen in some of her replies), not wanting to impose is one thing but there\u2019s a line and a young child would DEFINITELY pickup on her apprehensiveness. Her being respectful to his memory box was just shunning her own children away from it, when they could\u2019ve taken an opportunity to learn about the sons mother and involve the other kids in it. Ultimately it\u2019s the fathers fault for allowing any of this to continue but at the same time, OP shouldn\u2019t be trying to divide her family even more.", "Oh nice because I have a degree in psychology and often work with teens in school. Let me assure you, being 15 is not comparable to be a child. They're teens. They're not adults and they're not children. And you should treat them, and think of them, as such.", "Why would OP force her children to cheer for their bully?"]}
