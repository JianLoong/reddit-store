He has a 15 year old son Lucas. Lucas' mom died when he was 5 years old. I came into our marriage with Brynn who is 11 now and Miley who is 9. Together my husband and I have Alec who is 5. So Brynn and Miley are Lucas' stepsisters and Alec is his half brother.\n\nLucas has this trinket box with a couple of small trinkets inside of it that his mom left for him when she died. He keeps it in his room mostly but he likes to sometimes walk around with it in his hand. I have always told my kids it is not theirs, they are not to touch it unless Lucas says they can and they cannot pester him about it. When we first got married Miley was really fascinated with it and did want to touch it but I nipped it in the bud since it was so special.\n\nRegarding the dynamic. Lucas is very closed off from me and the kids. I have always done my best to bond with him but he is so withdrawn around me and therapy, which we did when we first got married, did not get us onto a path of being close, though I never expected to be his mom and I don't want that considered.\n\nAbout a month ago were having dinner and my husband cracked a joke that Lucas seemed to care more about the trinket box than us after Lucas refused to let Alec get a closer look at it. Lucas said, very seriously, that the box meant more than me and the kids and he would gladly trade us to save the box if anything happened to it. My husband was shocked Lucas spoke so seriously and the girls got upset about it. Alec wasn't paying attention when it was said. My husband took Lucas aside to speak to him and I spoke to the girls. They told me Lucas had said that before, that he would trade our lives to save his box, that we better hope he's never asked to save one of us or the box because the box would win. He said this to them on a few occasions over a period of time. They never told me because they didn't know how to bring it up. He told Alec the same as well.\n\nMy husband said Lucas would need some therapy because he saw nothing wrong with saying that honestly. I told him he was saying it and more to the kids when we didn't overhear. My husband said therapy would get to the bottom of things. A few days later Lucas is telling Brynn that he'd save his friends over the box but not her. I told my husband about it and he said it would be mentioned to the therapist (he had a consultation with one the next day). Lucas argued that he didn't need therapy and just because he doesn't care about us or our lives doesn't mean there is something wrong with him.\n\nI told my husband that given Lucas' attitude toward the kids, they will no longer show up to cheer him on at any sport games or the like. My husband argued we are still a family. I told him my kids do not need to cheer on the boy who has told them to their faces multiple times that their lives are meaningless to him. My husband thinks I am overreacting and I would be wrong to do this.

I do suggest therapy though.", "Why the fuck does this topic of saving someone over the box keep popping up like that ?\n\nESH, execpt the kids.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like this toxic environnement was brought by the adults. You husband comment during dinner should never have happened. Why would you ask something like that to a teenager who is clearly missing his mother ?\n\nTherapy is not going to change the fact that the 15 year old misses his mother, does not see you and your kids as his family and that you actually don't know what he would do if a crazy scenario actuallu happened.\n\nI could tell you that if there was a fire, I would risk my life to save a stranger. Truth is, I have never been in this situation and I don't know how I would react. And I'm thirty fucking two. Your SS is fucking 15. Just leave him the fuck alone, and let your kids the choice to go or not to his games.", "NTA (I feel like I\u2019m going to get a lot of flack for this)\n\nMortality is hard on kids. It really really really sucks that your stepson is struggling so much with his mother\u2019s passing/family blending, but that doesn\u2019t give him the right to continually bully and deride other children. If this was happening in a school setting, where a kid was telling other kids their lives are meaningless to them blah blah blah, that would be very not okay.\n\nTeaching your kids boundaries is important. Forcing them to go to his events after he speaks repeatedly like that (which clearly upsets them) is teaching them that their feelings don\u2019t matter. There are consequences to all actions and despite his grief, it\u2019s not an excuse to mistreat others. \n\nIt also might help for them not to go, giving him a little more space to adjust if it\u2019s just his dad + stepmom. Right now he\u2019s struggling to adjust to the new family dynamic and the full frontal of that at every event might be making him more bitter. Maybe with therapy and time, he\u2019ll request they come, maybe not. Maybe he\u2019ll apologize and try harder to get to know them. But a little breathing room actually seems to be what he needs (even if he\u2019s lashing out and getting it the wrong way).\n\nEdit: IVE NEVER GOTTEN AWARDS BEFORE AND IM FLATTERED AS H*CK", "Oh I'm going to be down-voted hard.. \nI say give him some space while simultaneously protecting your children at the same time. \n\nMaybe a couple of games? Then if he says anything you can be honest, I feel like you've made it clear my kids just do your head in, I assumed you don't want them there but they absolutely want to be, so if you would like them to come, absolutely, otherwise just myself and your dad can come and support you. Whatever your more comfortable with. \n\nBesides therapy, maybe you sit down with him and really talk to him, maybe explain that you do understand that his mum means everything to him and you don't want to be a fill in mum, that you do love and care about him and you love his dad. That your willing to give him the space that he wants if it's what he really wants. That you understand that coming in, marrying his dad, bringing two kids in the mix and then another one is alot and you get it but you'd like to find a middle ground and you'll respect what it is but he doesn't have to remind the kids they don't mean anything, that's been made clear but you hope at some point that changes because they love him. You all do. And tell him I have made it more then clear that box is irreplaceable and yours and yours alone. They will not ever touch it. \n\nHe may feel everyone is being forced on him but you do have to worry about your kids too, they have come into a new family and also got two more siblings and one can't stand the sight of them and that's gotta hurt too. \n\nDad should not of made that joke.", "INFO: has he hurt the girls? I get he says hurtful things, but has he been threatening or physically hurt them?", "[deleted]", "NAH\n\nThis is a very difficult situation and I sympathise with everybody. \n\nLucas is dealing with very complex issues which have resulted in complex feelings and attitudes towards the rest of the family, he probably has no idea how to manage the pain and grief he is experiencing and needs help with this, therapy is the right move for him. \n\nHowever, regardless of what is going on with him, saying he does not care about the lives of you and your other children is concerning and something that needs to be addressed. Your other children are being hurt by what he is saying and their feelings are just as important. I think you are right it is unfair to have their feelings put aside to cheer him on at a sport event if this is going to cause them further upset. \n\nYour husband is trying to help Lucas and keep the family together so is being pulled in both directions which is a very hard position to be in,  so I see how this is also a difficult decision for him to make. \n\nHave you thought about family therapy, this could help you all work through theese issues together without the other kids feelings being pushed aside and without Lucas feeling abandoned by you not being at his sporting events?", ">my husband cracked a joke that Lucas seemed to care more about the trinket box than us\n\nThis was not a joke, just cruel.\n\n>I told my husband that given Lucas' attitude toward the kids, they will no longer show up to cheer him on at any sport games or the like\n\nLe what am I reading here. \n\n\n\nYTA and a big time. Honestly I am not surprised that Lucas values his little box more than his family.\nHe lost his mom at a young age, that alone is already effecting his life till this day. And every time he opens up, nothing gets done about it or he gets punished by giving him no support.\n\nThe help he needs, doesnt he get from the adults who should take care of him.", "Mann this is a really sad situation tbh. I don't think you're the asshole persay because ofc you will be defensive over your kids but maybe Lucas thinks you replaced his mother and that's why he's being a brat?\nAlso yeah he's old enough and it's not fair for him to behave so childish but he lost his mum and that's the only reminder of her", "NTA.   \nYour children are the priority. Lucas has decided he wants no part in your lives. Give him his wish.", "NTA and tell your husband to take the box to get to cheer for him. Seems like its more important than family, so I see nothing wrong with you or the kids wanting to stay away from someone who doesn't have the family on his list of priorities. Also do keep an eye out for your kids as he seems to be someone who is lost in his own world and may lead to more issues later on.", "Obviously the box, in a way, replaced his mother. He sees her in it. And, of course, in his mind, it will come first, as he sees his mom in it.\n\nI would say YTA for the simple fact that I highly doubt that, if one of your own kids said something similar to what he said  to another of your kids, you would take the same approach and retract the support of one to the other.\n\nYou are clearly singling him out for not being blood related to you or your kids. And that will just drive the wedge even further between \"your family\" and him, and even his dad.\n\nThe dude is 15, you have to be better than this.\n\nEdit: I am not saying what he is doing is right and should be encouraged. I am saying it should be understood and dealt with in a reasonable and healthy way, taking into account he is a teenager that most probably has some very real issues that will not solve itself in one or two years of therapy. He needs nurturing, love and understanding, not scolding and isolation.", "YTA - He's just a boy, he lost his mother, and misses her a lot. He's in pain and dealing with it the only way he knows how. That box might as well be a part of his mother. Yes, he's dealing with it poorly, but you're still being petty over it and not understanding what he's dealing with. He might not even understand either. He's just a child and you're an adult. Your reaction to it is only going to push a wedge further between him and everyone. Therapy is going to take time.", "NAH. Lucas obviously has issues. However, he also doesn't have a fully developed frontal lobe and he lost his mother very young. Withdrawal would only damage him more. You are hurt,, the kids don't understand, but you are an adult and the only mother he has. If he were biologically yours you wouldn't abandon him for this.", "[deleted]", "This doesn't seem like the right sub for this. The post is 6 paragraphs long, and only the last one mentions the sport games. Honestly though, if after all of that the concern is specifically sport games, then YTA. It's one thing to say 'let's all give each other some space' and another to say 'they're not cheering for you at the game for a while'.", "YTA. His father has failed him, and you're actively making it worse. Why don't you ask your husband why he felt the need to make that particular \"joke\" towards his son?\n\nI don't think it was a joke at all. It reads much more like his father is annoyed that he hasn't gotten over the death of his mother yet. \n\nYou've repeatedly said you don't try or expect to be his mother, but I'm not convinced you're being completely truthful. You seem resentful to my mind, whether you realise it or not.\n\nIt's good that the child is in therapy. I think you and your husband need it too.", "Sounds like the boy has issues. You should be there for him.", "YTA you're definitely overreacting and being insensitive. Responding by pulling away and threatening to cause problems between Lucas and his siblings is only making the problem worse. Honestly I would drop the whole situation and go on with life, rather than getting upset over how a 15 year old thinks he would handle a hypothetical crisis that has almost no likelihood of ever occuring", "Every comment has had an automatic deflection fom OP which seems telling. \n\nI also notice all the time OP refers to her biological children as \"my kids\". I can see why the 15 year old resents you and \"your kids\" so much.", "You are over reacting.\n\nThe boy is clearly saying things because he feels insecure about his position within a family that he\u2019s largely not blood related. People say things they don\u2019t mean. Even hurtful things. I would guess he\u2019s been very jealous with all his step siblings. And he\u2019s been living with it everyday. What parents should do is not take things personal but understand what\u2019s making their children say things.", "YTA you should be the adult not acting like a child, all you're doing is pushing him further away", "NAH! This seems to be a heartbreaking situation and im so glad you are going for therapy. Perhaps consult with the therapist about what the best solution would be. As long as you are still going to go for his games and cheer for him and love him even though he shows that he doesnt need you i think letting your kids skip the games is fine. To me it seems like after their brother has repeatedly expressed how little he values them or cares for them making them attend his games would be a harmful message to them. They are also children in this situation and teaching them to enable someones bad behaviour would be a wrong lesson. But you as an adult still need to be there for him and perhaps you and your husband can attend family therapy with them and bring the other kids in if and when needed. All the kids in this situation need to be considered", "YWBTA if you go down that path.\n\nNow don't get me wrong I get that this hurts and Lucas needs to learn to shut it instead of saying these things out loud.\n\nHowever he's 15 and the \"I would friends but not all of you\" is clearly a pubescent way to stick it and be rude. I mean which teenager hasn't said hatefull things to it's parents/siblings? Either way he is being honest and he's allowed to value others and other things over anyone else and so are you. But if you really/honestly want to be what you always tried to be, then be the adult and better person in this situatie and kill him with kindness. If you don't go cheer him on, don't do it out of spite.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NOW they\u2019re in the process of getting him in therapy after this incident - so I don\u2019t consider that accommodation.

And yes regardless  of his age if he goes around constantly telling your kids I'd rather you die than lose my box he is abusing them emotionally.  He doesn't get a free pass because he has trauma. He needs therapy and to learn when the shut up. \n\nHe does not have to care about or even love your children. Hell he can even feel how he wants about his box.

I would be worries, and Reddit may judge you an AH for worrying but there are worse things to be than an AH when it comes to the safety of your kids. \n\nThink about it. If he were walking around at school and telling his fellow classmates that this box is more important to him than their lives, wouldn't someone complain or report him?

What I'm saying is that his attachment to them seems to be increasing and his detachment to his siblings seems to be increasing. Now, his siblings aren't allowed to touch them or look at them, which perfectly understandable. But what if the boundaries increase? What if he decides one day his siblings can't be in the same room with his box and so he forces his siblings out of the living room or kitchen because he's there with his box? What if 'this box means more to me than you' escalates to something not so nice? There are red flags here.

I understand that the boy is hurting over the loss of his mother but come on he is 15 by that age you know saying things like that are wrong. Just because he is hurting and lost a parent doesn't mean those girls don't matter and as their mother it is OPs job to keep them safe. Physically and mentally.

She fell asleep at the wheel and drove off the highway alone, very sudden death. She was only 34.

He has a hard time remembering what she sounded like, what her favorite perfume smelled like, among other things. I can tell that he gets angry when he tries to remember. He has a few of her things, but he really doesn't like to open up, I think he is afraid to show vulnerability because he is a \"man\" and wants people to think hes tough. \n\nMy point is that you and the kids need to let him feel the way he feels. That box means so much to him, and honestly, in your shoes, i would have told my kids they were not allowed to touch the box under any circumstances. Your kids have nothing to do with his mother, those are his prized posessions. Everyone needs to stop making him feel bad about the box. Your husband needs to stop making passive comments at dinner. I saw in another comment that someone suggested that you ask him about his mother, and his favorite memories with her. This is a great idea, but do not be offended or discouraged if he doesn't want to share with you just yet. Or better yet, maybe his dad can talk to him about memories the three of them had together more often. He brings up how little you and your kids mean to him so much because he is feeling defensive of his feelings. I know you didn't mean to make him feel this way, but that's what happened.

It's better long term with kids to take the high road and show them by example.  \n\nMaybe instead of proclaiming y'all won't go to the games anymore as punishment for the kid being an insensitive jerk, you can ask your kids if they want to keep going or not?

He can love his mother and still appreciate his life now. And part of that means bringing the memory of his mother back into the home, talking about his mother, and letting him know that you and the family can support her memory, his love for her, and respect her yourselves in your current life. She isn't forgotten or discarded. He doesn't have to fight his current happiness and current family in fear of losing his love for his mother.\n\n----\n\nAs for the actual issue, I'd say a few points. \n\nYour husband is definitely stoking the flames, trying to comment or judge how much love your stepson feels for you all. Tell him to quit making comments immediately and forever. Lucas has a right to his feelings, and your husband is being unfair and creating much expected resentment because of that. The comments are unnecessary and disrespectful. Just because your husband already moved on doesn't mean Lucas has to.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with your stepson valuing the box of his mother's belongings and his last memories of her over his stepfamily. It makes no sense to punish him for that. Firstly, it's hypothetical, and secondly even if it were true, he has every right and it makes complete sense. You would too, if you had to go through the same things. The point is, none of you are likely to ever be in a situation where this happens, so stop policing his feelings. He's just comforting himself. \n\nFinally, him constantly telling his siblings that, unprovoked, is wrong, and it could possibly be malicious if he's intentionally trying to hurt their feelings (even if he's just trying to push them away and remind everyone not to get comfortable because they're not his real family). For that, you should set limits with him on how he is to interact with them -- ok to feel your feelings, not ok to go out seeking to intentionally hurt them as they're just kids and aren't to blame -- and explain to your kids that he's just hurting and thinking up imaginary scenarios in his head to feel better about his loss. And to that effect, yes, somewhat distance your kids from him or at least supervise/be nearby when they hang out rather than leave him entirely alone with them in case his malicious behavior escalates in other ways. Do not have him be solely responsible for them or supervising them alone ever until you know you can trust him not to try to hurt them in other ways.\n\nGood luck resolving this issue.

Ask yourself *why* he is saying those things. He is coming from a place of deep, awful hurt, and as a kid, he doesn\u2019t know how to properly process and express his feelings. It\u2019s crucial that his feelings get addressed with love and patience, not with anger and punishment. If you get angry at him, he will take it to mean that his feelings don\u2019t matter and that you hate him, which will only reinforce his opinion that his deceased family matters more than his step family. Keep in mind that the brain doesn\u2019t finish developing til like age 24. Everything he experiences right now will lay the foundation for how he will behave and feel for the rest of his life. \n\nThis is also true for your bio kids, though from your post, it seems they have less trauma to process.

You and your husband need to go to therapy too. No exceptions.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredibly messy and delicate situation.

Their background is social psychology makes them particularly skilled at understanding family dynamics. They also tend to focus on actionable goals more than other types of therapists who focus more on the psychology of the individual and self-discovery. Different types of therapy have different strengths.\n\nAlso: don\u2019t stop supporting him at sports. This will send the message that his feelings are invalid and reinforce his feelings that you love your bio kids more. Be the adult. Don\u2019t take his literal words so seriously and ask yourself instead why your stepson is hurting so much. Keep in mind that he is a child\u2014his brain is still developing, and he doesn\u2019t know how to express his emotions in a healthy way. As your kid, he will learn how to handle conflict and pain from the behavior that YOU model. Don\u2019t teach him that when someone is hurting, you\u2019re supposed to hurt them back or turn your back on them.\n\nDon\u2019t think his words will go completely unaddressed, though. Once he makes some progress with the therapist, it\u2019ll be the right time and place to discuss how the things he said hurt the people around him and that we have to be responsible for our actions even when we\u2019re in pain ourselves. But there will be an appropriate time to address his words. Bringing it up too early might make him refuse to cooperate with therapy.

You definitely don\u2019t want to teach them that you should sit back and take abuse. If they don\u2019t feel comfortable interacting with him, that\u2019s ok for now.

I hope that the therapist will help them strike the balance between supporting the older kid who is obviously hurting and keep him accountable for his words and actions. I think with kids it\u2019s a lot more delicate because they internalize *everything* their family does and they\u2019re still learning how to process emotions. If they punish the older kid too harshly, they will be teaching the younger kids that big feelings are bad and should be met with anger. If they excuse the older kid\u2019s behavior, they will be teaching the younger kids that it\u2019s normal to shut up and take it when someone abuses you. \n\nSo it\u2019s like, how do you keep the older kid accountable for his behavior while also continuing to show him that you love him? I\u2019m not a parent or a therapist, but my uneducated guess would be that you shouldn\u2019t conflate unrelated things. Him lashing out at his siblings doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with sports. If he misbehaves, he\u2019s old enough that his parents should be able to sit him down and talk things out. He\u2019s obviously hurting and lashing out as a cry for help. His parents need to listen to him and understand him. They need to let him get things off his chest but also talk to him about how his words hurt other people. This should all be done in a calm, firm, loving way. It\u2019s going to be a shitload of hard work for the parents. \n\nRefusing to attend his sports events is taking the easy way out. Instead of understanding and addressing the root cause of his issues, it\u2019s steamrolling his feelings and punishing him for being in pain. The parents will think they did great by providing consequences to his actions, but in the long run, this will only make the kid even more resentful, distant, and angry. Kids should not be taught that big feelings should be stamped down. They need to be taught how to process and express feelings in a healthy way. And that involves a lot of patience and support.\n\nMeanwhile, the younger kids need to learn how to strike a balance between extending empathy and standing up for themselves. The oldest kid needs to understand how he\u2019s hurt them instead of just getting punished for hurting them. He\u2019s at the age where he has to learn how to talk things out and consider the wider impact of his actions. Punishing him doesn\u2019t get to the WHY of his behavior. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s bad to punish him by cutting support to something he loves. That just reinforces his feelings that his new family sucks and makes him feel even more alone.

What happens when he travels, moves house, etc? \n\nI think the therapist may also wish to help him understand that the box is not his only link to his mother, so if god forbid something happens to it, it won\u2019t be the end of the world.

I said that therapy will help the family understand the delicate balance between keeping the older kid accountable while also showing him love and support. Punishment alone can backfire because the situation is so complex. If the younger kids don\u2019t want to go to his games, they shouldn\u2019t have to. I didn\u2019t offer up any more detail because that\u2019s something that therapy will determine. I do think the stepmom should continue to go to his games. As his parent and an adult, it\u2019s important for her to show unconditional love and immense patience. Her younger kids shouldn\u2019t have to do that, though. That\u2019s too complex and heavy a burden for a child and would definitely send the wrong message that you\u2019re supposed sit back and take abuse. If the stepmom goes, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she\u2019s supporting abuse. It means that she\u2019s extending unconditional love so that the older kid will have a safe space to heal. The mom should talk to her kids and explain to them why she would do that.\n\nThat said, therapy might determine that what I\u2019m saying is fucking stupid. That\u2019s why I tried to keep my post vague. There\u2019s not nearly enough info to really say what\u2019s right or wrong. I would hate to be in this family\u2019s shoes, that\u2019s for sure. I wish them patience and luck.\n\nAs an aside, my dad was abusive, and while he berated me, my mom would just sit there quietly and let it happen. Then, she would talk to him in private, and he would come out and apologize. It left me feeling confused AF, and I developed severe anxiety, accepted abuse from partners, and had little emotional control. I was resentful of both my parents. Therapy has fixed our relationship, a decade or more later\u2026 My mom should have removed me from the abusive situation in order to protect me, whether that was divorce, making my dad leave the room til he calmed down, or leaving the house with me for a couple hours. If she wanted to stay with my dad and work things out, that was her choice to make. But she made me suffer for it. In the end, my dad fixed his issues in therapy, largely thanks to my mom\u2019s insane level of patience and dedication. Would I have done that? No. I would have divorced for sure. \n\nIf OP wants to continue to show love and support to her stepson, that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s her decision. But her kids should absolutely not have to be dragged into it. Since I\u2019m not a therapist, I honestly have no idea how that would even be accomplished. You can\u2019t divorce your children. She\u2019d have to deem the stepson so abusive to her kids that she has no choice but to divorce her husband for the sake of her kids.

That box is his *only memory of his mother* he wants to keep that separate from his \"new family\" and that is reasonable.

Bc\u2026\n\n8) I promise you, no matter how angry he is at not having his mom, and watching as his 3 siblings **do** have their mom\u2014 however much your not having pushed him to view you as a replacement is a good thing, and also might be a constant reminder of what he does not have!?\u2014 he would be destroyed if you guys literally died, and putting the power to wish that to reality on his shoulders, rather than seeing his lashing out for exactly the trauma response/cry for help it is, is frightening. (What happens if, god forbid, something *were* to happen to you or the girls or littlest bro?? Do you not see that in his child\u2019s mind he might believe his words caused that additional loss???) \n\n9) His profound, YOUNG pain needs to be contextualized by the ADULTS around him (ie *you*!!!) and accepted not as gospel or a literal threat, but with empathy and compassion for what he is TRYING to convey in those hurtful words. \n\n10) Do you even *know* what he is trying to express? Does **he**??? How has your family unit incorporated the memory of his mom? Have you proactively worked towards building him a support network within his own family, or does his loss go unnoticed except when it comes to \u2018quirky\u2019 little things like him carrying around his \u201ctrinket box\u201d? Is there space for his grief in your family, or is he expected to carry that weight alone, while he watches his dad move on..? \n\n11) WHY DID HE EVER FEEL THE NEED TO \u201cCOMPARE\u201d IN THE FIRST PLACE??? Where did the idea come from that this \u201cprecious object that represents *everything* to me, but that no one else in the family has bothered to **truly** understand*, has *anything* to do with you, or his siblings, or anything that could even ever be compared to anything else at all?? *If* he came up with the concept himself (and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d!!) then once again, where did the need to make that comparison come from!!? Either internally to him, bc he\u2019s like, learning to sort/assign value to things/categorize the world to make sense of a world that\u2019s rightfully really scary to him\u2026 or from some external source (however innocent) like little bro or one of your daughters asking \u201cI want to see what\u2019s inside? Why won\u2019t you let me?? It can\u2019t be *that* important, it\u2019s just STUFF. What would you do if the house caught fire and you could only save one thing, would you save me or that stupid box, huh?\u201d \n\n12)  IDK, there\u2019s so much more but I\u2019m getting way too protective of your stepson and I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be as nice as is helpful. I know what a Herculean effort it is to merge families in the best of circumstances, and I can only imagine the added challenges of a moody teenager who suffered such an emotionally devastating blow at such a young age, and I applaud you for noticing that there is a problem, and that it is beyond the scope of the tools you currently possess to solve. \n\nBut you need to get those tools, OP. You. Not him. Maybe his dad, too. *Probably* his dad, too. But you, specifically, most of all. As you represent everything that has been taken from him in much the same way as that box, except where it is sacred, you embody all that challenges that sanctity. Is it fair? Nope. But you\u2019re the adult, and you signed up for this when you married his dad. \n\nYTA resoundingly, but also with a good deal of grace (bc who of us are perfect? and who of us know how to navigate life\u2019s complicated twists and turns without support/the right tools?) \n\n*PLEASE* get yourself in to therapy, with your husband or alone, get Lucas in to his own therapy, and once he\u2019s established rapport and you\u2019re better equipped, ask both therapists to help introduce the family to his sessions as/when/IF needed.", "YTA", "ESH.

I would not force your children to attend his games. I think you need to honor his mother\u2019s memory with family pictures of her throughout the house & dad talking to him about family memories with his mom. (Plus a picture of just her in his room,) OP do you do something on his mom\u2019s birthday and death day? I think you should. Yes SS needs to know that the heart expands to accommodate more people but he. needs help dealing with his grief. \n\nYou can\u2019t force him to love/like your children. So just stop! Instead aim for being civil to each other.

Therapy is not going to \"fix\" your step-son's attitude, it is a tool to help him process the things he has been through and decide how he wants to handle the situation he finds himself in now. You should not be using the threat of more therapy to imply that there's something wrong with him, because that only makes him feel shame, and it will make him resent the therapy. Therapy does not work if the patient doesn't work WITH the therapist. He lost his mother and is now resentful of you and your kids, and he's acting out according. When he says he would trade your lives for that box, he's trying to express that his connection to his mother is stronger and more valuable than his connection to you and his siblings. Of course he doesn't feel the need to say that same thing about his friends, because in his mind, his connection with his friends doesn't threaten his connection with his mother. Whereas forming a connection with you (and your children by extension) may feel to him as if he is betraying her somehow. Further dividing your family by forbidding your other children to support his interests is only going to make the situation worse.", "Everyone sucks here. Big time. Sounds like mom and dad were lonely, and didn\u2019t totally think through the impact getting married would have on everyone", "Agreed. \n\nWhy would a kid's father bait him with, 'Seems like you care more about that box'?\n\n It's clear he has an attachment to it.

I\u2019m stunned by these comments.\n\nThere\u2019s no excuse for telling a CHILD that I would save an inanimate object over you.  Then to rub it in by stating that he would save his friend over them. He\u2019s 15 and most likely in high school. He is telling this to elementary schoolers. It\u2019s disgusting", "He\u2019s 15, he\u2019s old enough to regulate his own emotions. Op has done everything she can and he\u2019s chosen to verbally abuse her children.", "Some of them are making stuff up that she must be doing lol", "SO MUCH THIS!!!!", "I\u2019m betting Lucas feels isolated and lonely- where his Dad has a new family- he feels like his Mom has been forgotten in this- hence his clinging to that box of trinkets. It\u2019s ALL he has to hold onto. \nHis step and half sibling have a Mom and Dad- he feels like is alone in this world- with the exception of his friends. \nDoes he have photos of him and his Mother? Is he permitted to talk about her? Ask about her? Does he still have a connection with her family? \nDoes the rest of the family openly ask about her? Remember her on her birthday? Offer support on the anniversary of her passing? \nI can\u2019t echo the post above enough- it absolutely contains the best guidance in healing the pain this young teen is suffering under. \nFor all OP knows- even though she\u2019s warned the other kids not to touch the box - that may be something that occurred before- or he may be ridiculed by his siblings for his attachment to it-and because Lucas feels so cut off from the rest of the family- he didn\u2019t say anything. There IS a reason behind this- the question is how to discover it and fix it .", "My question is did this kid get any type of grief counseling after his mom died.  He wa 5 years old and probably didn't understand fully.  Also how much are these kids pestering him about this box?  Are they telling the full story like what did they say to Lucas for him to tell them that?", "Well, I've done/said similar things when my younger brother kept messing with my items that had sentimental value to me. To me, the stuff he messed with wasn't just stuff. It was an emotional attachment so him messing with it felt hurtful. Maybe he saying that stuff out of hurt.", "That or there's some info missing in the post.

There's so many reddit posts about that.", "Kids definitely say weird, random nonsensical things but\u2026 this is a 15 year old saying this to kids who are significantly younger than him, including his 5 year old half brother.", "That is why I'm having uneasy feelings about the years of missing info.", "NTA. The kid is old enough to choose whether he wants to be a prick or not. He also chose to close himself off from you and your kids instead of embracing you over the years. This is a kid who will push people away his whole life until one day he wonders why he is so alone. Then,MAYBE then he'll reach out and apologize for being such a prick but until then you owe him nothing. People love to say and think that just cause youre family you HAVE to get along or look the other way from shitty behavior. You and your kids have feelings too,they just don't matter to this asshole.", "What a ridiculously unhelpful comment. Therapy is mentioned multiple times in the post.", "This is what I want to know.

The fact that the father neglects his duties doesn't mean his wife must be the last frontier.", "This. But also I think that the husband is a big part of the problem here. If your kid says stuff like this, you don\u2019t say \u201coh, it\u2019s fine\u201d. You ask if they have any reason they are worrying about the box. You ask if they would like to get a safe to keep it in. And then you tell them that they don\u2019t have to like their step siblings but he has to treat them with respect. If he\u2019s hurting he can ask for help but it\u2019s not ok to take it out on someone else. I would enroll him in some sort of anti bullying teaching not as punishment but teaching. And do punish him if he doesn\u2019t leave the step siblings alone after a warning. The dad needs to be the one doing all this and if he didn\u2019t step up, I would be quick to separate the households because the younger kids don\u2019t deserve to be bullied and it won\u2019t get better without his active intervention", "> I want you to try something, and it\u2019s gonna suck: when he says mean things, don\u2019t focus on what he\u2019s literally saying. Ask yourself why he is saying those things. He is coming from a place of deep, awful hurt, and as a kid, he doesn\u2019t know how to properly process and express his feelings. It\u2019s crucial that his feelings get addressed with love and patience, not with anger and punishment. If you get angry at him, he will take it to mean that his feelings don\u2019t matter and that you hate him, which will only reinforce his opinion that his deceased family matters more than his step family. Keep in mind that the brain doesn\u2019t finish developing til like age 24. Everything he experiences right now will lay the foundation for how he will behave and feel for the rest of his life. \n\nThis would be a valid take if he were venting his misdirected anger at his mom's passing on his stepmother; as the adult she is expected to take the high road and allow him to express himself. But that's not what he has been doing, at all. He's instead been secretly bullying every other child in the house, all of whom are younger than him and all of whom will start developing their OWN trauma, **because of Lucas**, if someone doesn't put a stop to this behavior.\n\nOP has an obligation to take care of Lucas. She also has an obligation to take care of the other three children in that house, and right now Lucas has been targeting **them** with incredibly hateful and cruel comments. \n\n>Also: don\u2019t stop supporting him at sports. This will send the message that his feelings are invalid and reinforce his feelings that you love your bio kids more. Be the adult. Don\u2019t take his literal words so seriously and ask yourself instead why your stepson is hurting so much.\n\nAgain, we are acting as though Lucas is bullying his stepmother. He isn't, he's bullying an 11 year old, a 9 year old, and a 5 year old. They literally CAN'T \"be the adult\" and take the high road because they are **children**.", ">And don't try to claim you're in therapy because no reasonable therapist is going to support your idea that when a hurting teen says something lashing out at younger step/half siblings the best way to fix that is to retaliate by not supporting him.\n\nAs a therapist I feel qualified to address this, and I would **never** tell a parent that they should force children to attend events with an older child who has been relentlessly bullying them. You're acting like Lucas is the only one who matters in this entire family dynamic. The younger children, who I will remind you have been his actual targets rather than OP, are under no obligation whatsoever to continue inflicting Lucas on themselves if they don't want to.\n\nThe other children need support just as badly as Lucas does, especially since they are currently being bullied with incredibly hateful and cruel comments from someone under their own roof. OP is obligated to support Lucas. The younger children that are currently being harassed by him **are not**, and no therapist in their right mind would ever suggest that they be forced to go to events for Lucas.", "I'm pretty sure something like this will happen anyway, and he is counting days. Op left out a lot, but even with this description it is visible that the boy feels that he as his own person doesn't have space there, that he is forced to \"love\" a family that was thrown into his life. OP is probably a SAHM or at least the primary caregiver, and his father is \"not on his side\" either. So he is fighting for his right to be him, son of a mother he misses and who loved him. The solution is not for OP to tell him a whole bunch of stuff about \"Loving him\" when she clearly doesn't. She resents him because he doesn't like her kids and her. So the revolutionary Idea would be to try it with honesty, accepting reality and no foul jokes. The situation is that they are in this together, and have to cope somehow. Everyone wants to do this without getting hurt to much. And with this base, find rules and ways. For example, does she really think he wants her daughters cheer for him in his matches? He will want to have his dad there, but he would probably prefer to not share him. But the dad probably thinks this is heavy duty because he would prefer to have her caring the mental load of how to work the relationships...", "It\u2019s obvious the whole family has been obsessed with his trinket box since they met him and despite the OP saying she nipped it in the bud- here they are YEARS later still talking about it in a joking manner. \n\nKind of like Cinderella step sisters did with her dress that her mom left her until it was destroyed.", "Thank you, but the one I most feel sorry for is his son.  He constantly tells that poor kid that he's stupid and mocks him in front of other adults. A couple of years back, when the son was about 13 and I found out exactly how awful he's being (his behavior has escalated since the days we grew up; back then he did mock me and make me feel inferior, but he never mocked me in such a public and obvious way as he's doing to his son) I called CPS, against the wishes of my parents. CPS unfortunately did nothing, probably because my parents told his wife to lie.  I don't have a direct contact with his teenage son nor do I live in the same town or I would try to do more.  He'll be free in a few years, but living his whole life under someone who made sure he has no sense of self worth isn't an easy burden to get out from under.  It was bad enough from a brother, it must have been devastating from a father. He might even emulate his father, but lord I hope not.   \n\n\nPart of the issue is that said asshole brother clearly has some kind of mental handicap.  Other siblings think for sure it's schizophrenia, but I am the one closest to him in age who has lived with him and around him the longest, and I know him better than they do. I am fairly certain he has something like narcissistic personality disorder, and his recent bouts of being sure, for example, that someone is leaving dead animals on his porch because they want to steal the music he writes, are just the extreme version of that.  If you think you are the most important person in the world, it naturally follows that people would be trying to harass and steal from you. It's this extreme paranoia that makes me believe he could kill someone. I believe he has already raped one or more women, though in his mind it probably wasn't  rape (refusing to accept a no) because aside from his personal problems, we were both raised by parents with terrible patriarchal ideas about men and women.", "ugghghgh that is horrible.", "YTA\n\nHow on earth would refusing to go to this kid\u2019s sporting events help this situation?? You see a kid in pain who isn\u2019t coping well and your response is to withdraw family support. That\u2019s really messed up.\n\nI suggest that you re-read your post but substitute \u201cthe box\u201d and \u201ctrinkets\u201d with \u201cmemories of his mom.\u201d Obviously there are no situations where he would have to choose between memories and living beings. That\u2019s also true of the box since it is not in danger of disappearing. The mean scenarios he is talking about are not real. His fear of losing those memories, however, are very very real. And clearly very painful or he wouldn\u2019t be focusing on them so much.\n\nI think you owe your stepson an apology for not doing a better job of respecting and honoring his mother\u2019s memory. And another apology for not recognizing his continued grief and offering more support and love as his stepmom. You were probably so focused on trying not to \u201creplace\u201d his mom that you failed to just be a supportive stepparent and adult in his life. You met this child when he was 7, only two years after his mom died. The failure to bond with him is on you. You and your husband should have done more from the beginning.

People are acting like OP and her daughters have to keep sacrificing their happiness for the stepson and I'm not sure why.\n\nA 15 year old knows that saying he'd let the other kids die to save his box is hurtful. He's doing that because he's been hurt himself and hopefully they can help him, but they can't let that take the form of letting him continue to hurt the other kids.\n\nLetting them distance themselves from him is a perfectly reasonable response.\n\nNow people are slamming OP for not getting indivual therapy for themselves to better manage the step sons issues? OP already says they tried family therapy!

Nothing about this post is about punishing the step kid. The kid's not going to care if people he doesn't care about are at the game or not. It's about the correct response for *her* kids. It's about whether *they* should be forced to attend the game when the person they're going to the game for doesn't care if they're there or not. *Her* kids possibly are being inconvenienced by going, but the step kid isn't benefitting, so of course it's the most sensible thing to do.
