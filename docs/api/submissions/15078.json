{"id": 15078, "submission_id": "12qgqhn", "title": "AITA for telling my husband my kids will not be supporting my stepson at sport games anymore?", "selftext": "My husband and I have been married for 6 years and together for 8. He has a 15 year old son Lucas. Lucas' mom died when he was 5 years old. I came into our marriage with Brynn who is 11 now and Miley who is 9. Together my husband and I have Alec who is 5. So Brynn and Miley are Lucas' stepsisters and Alec is his half brother.\n\nLucas has this trinket box with a couple of small trinkets inside of it that his mom left for him when she died. He keeps it in his room mostly but he likes to sometimes walk around with it in his hand. I have always told my kids it is not theirs, they are not to touch it unless Lucas says they can and they cannot pester him about it. When we first got married Miley was really fascinated with it and did want to touch it but I nipped it in the bud since it was so special.\n\nRegarding the dynamic. Lucas is very closed off from me and the kids. I have always done my best to bond with him but he is so withdrawn around me and therapy, which we did when we first got married, did not get us onto a path of being close, though I never expected to be his mom and I don't want that considered.\n\nAbout a month ago were having dinner and my husband cracked a joke that Lucas seemed to care more about the trinket box than us after Lucas refused to let Alec get a closer look at it. Lucas said, very seriously, that the box meant more than me and the kids and he would gladly trade us to save the box if anything happened to it. My husband was shocked Lucas spoke so seriously and the girls got upset about it. Alec wasn't paying attention when it was said. My husband took Lucas aside to speak to him and I spoke to the girls. They told me Lucas had said that before, that he would trade our lives to save his box, that we better hope he's never asked to save one of us or the box because the box would win. He said this to them on a few occasions over a period of time. They never told me because they didn't know how to bring it up. He told Alec the same as well.\n\nMy husband said Lucas would need some therapy because he saw nothing wrong with saying that honestly. I told him he was saying it and more to the kids when we didn't overhear. My husband said therapy would get to the bottom of things. A few days later Lucas is telling Brynn that he'd save his friends over the box but not her. I told my husband about it and he said it would be mentioned to the therapist (he had a consultation with one the next day). Lucas argued that he didn't need therapy and just because he doesn't care about us or our lives doesn't mean there is something wrong with him.\n\nI told my husband that given Lucas' attitude toward the kids, they will no longer show up to cheer him on at any sport games or the like. My husband argued we are still a family. I told him my kids do not need to cheer on the boy who has told them to their faces multiple times that their lives are meaningless to him. My husband thinks I am overreacting and I would be wrong to do this.

I do suggest therapy though.", "Why the fuck does this topic of saving someone over the box keep popping up like that ?\n\nESH, execpt the kids.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like this toxic environnement was brought by the adults. You husband comment during dinner should never have happened. Why would you ask something like that to a teenager who is clearly missing his mother ?\n\nTherapy is not going to change the fact that the 15 year old misses his mother, does not see you and your kids as his family and that you actually don't know what he would do if a crazy scenario actuallu happened.\n\nI could tell you that if there was a fire, I would risk my life to save a stranger. Truth is, I have never been in this situation and I don't know how I would react. And I'm thirty fucking two. Your SS is fucking 15. Just leave him the fuck alone, and let your kids the choice to go or not to his games.", "NTA (I feel like I\u2019m going to get a lot of flack for this)\n\nMortality is hard on kids. It really really really sucks that your stepson is struggling so much with his mother\u2019s passing/family blending, but that doesn\u2019t give him the right to continually bully and deride other children. If this was happening in a school setting, where a kid was telling other kids their lives are meaningless to them blah blah blah, that would be very not okay.\n\nTeaching your kids boundaries is important. Forcing them to go to his events after he speaks repeatedly like that (which clearly upsets them) is teaching them that their feelings don\u2019t matter. There are consequences to all actions and despite his grief, it\u2019s not an excuse to mistreat others. \n\nIt also might help for them not to go, giving him a little more space to adjust if it\u2019s just his dad + stepmom. Right now he\u2019s struggling to adjust to the new family dynamic and the full frontal of that at every event might be making him more bitter. Maybe with therapy and time, he\u2019ll request they come, maybe not. Maybe he\u2019ll apologize and try harder to get to know them. But a little breathing room actually seems to be what he needs (even if he\u2019s lashing out and getting it the wrong way).", "Oh I'm going to be down-voted hard.. \nI say give him some space while simultaneously protecting your children at the same time. \n\nMaybe a couple of games? Then if he says anything you can be honest, I feel like you've made it clear my kids just do your head in, I assumed you don't want them there but they absolutely want to be, so if you would like them to come, absolutely, otherwise just myself and your dad can come and support you. Whatever your more comfortable with. \n\nBesides therapy, maybe you sit down with him and really talk to him, maybe explain that you do understand that his mum means everything to him and you don't want to be a fill in mum, that you do love and care about him and you love his dad. That your willing to give him the space that he wants if it's what he really wants. That you understand that coming in, marrying his dad, bringing two kids in the mix and then another one is alot and you get it but you'd like to find a middle ground and you'll respect what it is but he doesn't have to remind the kids they don't mean anything, that's been made clear but you hope at some point that changes because they love him. You all do. And tell him I have made it more then clear that box is irreplaceable and yours and yours alone. They will not ever touch it. \n\nHe may feel everyone is being forced on him but you do have to worry about your kids too, they have come into a new family and also got two more siblings and one can't stand the sight of them and that's gotta hurt too. \n\nDad should not of made that joke.", "INFO: has he hurt the girls? I get he says hurtful things, but has he been threatening or physically hurt them?", "He\u2019s not choosing the box over you guys. He\u2019s choosing his mom over you guys. Be kind to him pls. You\u2019ll will have a very different relationship if you react with love than anger", "NAH\n\nThis is a very difficult situation and I sympathise with everybody. \n\nLucas is dealing with very complex issues which have resulted in complex feelings and attitudes towards the rest of the family, he probably has no idea how to manage the pain and grief he is experiencing and needs help with this, therapy is the right move for him. \n\nHowever, regardless of what is going on with him, saying he does not care about the lives of you and your other children is concerning and something that needs to be addressed. Your other children are being hurt by what he is saying and their feelings are just as important. I think you are right it is unfair to have their feelings put aside to cheer him on at a sport event if this is going to cause them further upset. \n\nYour husband is trying to help Lucas and keep the family together so is being pulled in both directions which is a very hard position to be in,  so I see how this is also a difficult decision for him to make. \n\nHave you thought about family therapy, this could help you all work through theese issues together without the other kids feelings being pushed aside and without Lucas feeling abandoned by you not being at his sporting events?", ">my husband cracked a joke that Lucas seemed to care more about the trinket box than us\n\nThis was not a joke, just cruel.\n\n>I told my husband that given Lucas' attitude toward the kids, they will no longer show up to cheer him on at any sport games or the like\n\nLe what am I reading here. \n\n\n\nYTA and a big time. Honestly I am not surprised that Lucas values his little box more than his family.\nHe lost his mom at a young age, that alone is already effecting his life till this day. And every time he opens up, nothing gets done about it or he gets punished by giving him no support.\n\nThe help he needs, doesnt he get from the adults who should take care of him.", "Mann this is a really sad situation tbh. I don't think you're the asshole persay because ofc you will be defensive over your kids but maybe Lucas thinks you replaced his mother and that's why he's being a brat?\nAlso yeah he's old enough and it's not fair for him to behave so childish but he lost his mum and that's the only reminder of her", "NTA.   \nYour children are the priority. Lucas has decided he wants no part in your lives. Give him his wish.", "NTA and tell your husband to take the box to get to cheer for him. Seems like its more important than family, so I see nothing wrong with you or the kids wanting to stay away from someone who doesn't have the family on his list of priorities. Also do keep an eye out for your kids as he seems to be someone who is lost in his own world and may lead to more issues later on.", "Obviously the box, in a way, replaced his mother. He sees her in it. And, of course, in his mind, it will come first, as he sees his mom in it.\n\nI would say YTA for the simple fact that I highly doubt that, if one of your own kids said something similar to what he said  to another of your kids, you would take the same approach and retract the support of one to the other.\n\nYou are clearly singling him out for not being blood related to you or your kids. And that will just drive the wedge even further between \"your family\" and him, and even his dad.\n\nThe dude is 15, you have to be better than this.\n\nEdit: I am not saying what he is doing is right and should be encouraged. I am saying it should be understood and dealt with in a reasonable and healthy way, taking into account he is a teenager that most probably has some very real issues that will not solve itself in one or two years of therapy. He needs nurturing, love and understanding, not scolding and isolation.", "YTA - He's just a boy, he lost his mother, and misses her a lot. He's in pain and dealing with it the only way he knows how. That box might as well be a part of his mother. Yes, he's dealing with it poorly, but you're still being petty over it and not understanding what he's dealing with. He might not even understand either. He's just a child and you're an adult. Your reaction to it is only going to push a wedge further between him and everyone. Therapy is going to take time.", "NAH. Lucas obviously has issues. However, he also doesn't have a fully developed frontal lobe and he lost his mother very young. Withdrawal would only damage him more. You are hurt,, the kids don't understand, but you are an adult and the only mother he has. If he were biologically yours you wouldn't abandon him for this.", "YTA. Is it really that hard to see why the box and it's contents mean so much to him? \n\nYou need to realize that therapy won't change how the kid feels. \n\nYou and your kids aren't his family. Is it that hard to understand why when given a choice between an item that his dead mom left him and you and your kids, that he would choose the box? The kid lost his mom when he was 5. That's going to affect him for the rest of his life.", "This doesn't seem like the right sub for this. The post is 6 paragraphs long, and only the last one mentions the sport games. Honestly though, if after all of that the concern is specifically sport games, then YTA. It's one thing to say 'let's all give each other some space' and another to say 'they're not cheering for you at the game for a while'.", "YTA. His father has failed him, and you're actively making it worse. Why don't you ask your husband why he felt the need to make that particular \"joke\" towards his son?\n\nI don't think it was a joke at all. It reads much more like his father is annoyed that he hasn't gotten over the death of his mother yet. \n\nYou've repeatedly said you don't try or expect to be his mother, but I'm not convinced you're being completely truthful. You seem resentful to my mind, whether you realise it or not.\n\nIt's good that the child is in therapy. I think you and your husband need it too.", "Sounds like the boy has issues. You should be there for him.", "YTA you're definitely overreacting and being insensitive. Responding by pulling away and threatening to cause problems between Lucas and his siblings is only making the problem worse. Honestly I would drop the whole situation and go on with life, rather than getting upset over how a 15 year old thinks he would handle a hypothetical crisis that has almost no likelihood of ever occuring", "Every comment has had an automatic deflection fom OP which seems telling. \n\nI also notice all the time OP refers to her biological children as \"my kids\". I can see why the 15 year old resents you and \"your kids\" so much.", "You are over reacting.\n\nThe boy is clearly saying things because he feels insecure about his position within a family that he\u2019s largely not blood related. People say things they don\u2019t mean. Even hurtful things. I would guess he\u2019s been very jealous with all his step siblings. And he\u2019s been living with it everyday. What parents should do is not take things personal but understand what\u2019s making their children say things.", "YTA you should be the adult not acting like a child, all you're doing is pushing him further away", "NAH! This seems to be a heartbreaking situation and im so glad you are going for therapy. Perhaps consult with the therapist about what the best solution would be. As long as you are still going to go for his games and cheer for him and love him even though he shows that he doesnt need you i think letting your kids skip the games is fine. To me it seems like after their brother has repeatedly expressed how little he values them or cares for them making them attend his games would be a harmful message to them. They are also children in this situation and teaching them to enable someones bad behaviour would be a wrong lesson. But you as an adult still need to be there for him and perhaps you and your husband can attend family therapy with them and bring the other kids in if and when needed. All the kids in this situation need to be considered", "YWBTA if you go down that path.\n\nNow don't get me wrong I get that this hurts and Lucas needs to learn to shut it instead of saying these things out loud.\n\nHowever he's 15 and the \"I would friends but not all of you\" is clearly a pubescent way to stick it and be rude. I mean which teenager hasn't said hatefull things to it's parents/siblings? Either way he is being honest and he's allowed to value others and other things over anyone else and so are you. But if you really/honestly want to be what you always tried to be, then be the adult and better person in this situatie and kill him with kindness. If you don't go cheer him on, don't do it out of spite.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Keep perusing it though, it is the right thing even if he can't see that yet.\n\nI see your point about the family therapy and hopefully after some individual therapy, you can work up to therapy with you and your husband and then include the other children. If possible maybe have your other children speak to somebody who could help them understand Lucas and his current feelings, this understanding could help them process what they are hearing in a healthier way in the meantime. I understand though therapy is expensive and not always easy to access.\n\nThis will be a long process but hopefully a successful one in the end. I am sorry for this difficult situation.", "Swe dude.  Just don't drag your kids into this , it's their choice so of they wanna go let them if they don't wanna they should not.

Your reaction to it is to separate him more than he probably already feels.", "How does going to his games \"subject them to this\"?\n\nHe is still a child. Withdrawing your support from him will have lifelong consequences. You are understandably hurt and the kids are understandably confused.

To them it feels like they are being punished (the girls feel that way at least) because they feel he hates them and wishes they were dead.", "Yes, you do. He needs to work with his therapist and learn to understand how not ok that was. It would also help to talk with the other kids and help them understand that it's not about them. But that should result in exclusion from the family.", "You have a duty to make sure your kids are okay and - guess what? That INCLUDES YOUR STEPSON. He isn\u2019t going to suddenly feel welcome into your blended family if you decide to divide the household.", "He is still a child. You are assigning adult punishment and interpretation to a kid. As far as the girls go, I don't blame them for not wanting to go.", "Well he has stated plenty of times that this is not his family so its fine and it is not logical to subject two young kids to the stepsons lashing out just because he lost his mother years ago. Everyone gets it and have accommodated him but that doesn\u2019t give him the right to hurt 2 innocent kids. Thats where OP drew the line and is justified.", "I acknowledge he is a child. But so are the other children. I would still be going regardless. But I have already failed to protect the kids from hearing it repeatedly. I don't want to keep failing them. They didn't know how to talk to me and I had no idea what was going on and being said to them.", "he\u2019s also a 15yo kid, so I don\u2019t consider it logical to just throw in the towel. It doesn\u2019t seem like he was truly \u201caccommodated\u201d considering he was 7yo thrown into a house with 2 small children he did not know, and then the added son a few years later. OP only mentions trying therapy when they FIRST got married (so, when he was 7) and stopped because of him being \u201cwithdrawn\u201d towards it.  NOW they\u2019re in the process of getting him in therapy after this incident - so I don\u2019t consider that accommodation. Especially since they\u2019ve KNOWN about his attachment to the box, which is not normal at all. Something that should\u2019ve been addressed in therapy instead of as a joke at a dinner table years after the fact.", "I think if you would still be going but not requiring the other children to attend, that's completely reasonable.", "Yes, I would still be attending. I would never stop going myself. But I am an adult and my kids are still kids and I want to be able to protect them."]}
