We have all lived together for over a year and haven\u2019t had any serious problems. I mean sure the occasional problem of a person not helping with chores as much as they should but stuff happens. \n\nBut I think that I recently found an issue that I can\u2019t let slide. One of my roommates got a girlfriend and they were initially together for about month and then broke up, they have now been together since I believe September of this year. Let me just say she has been at our apartment constantly which is not an issue when she is in his room or we all decide to hang out together. But as of recently he picked up full time work and has been working 40+ hours a week and has not home for a majority of Fri-Mon. With that pickup in his work hours what I have noticed is that she will be left at our apartment without him there when he leaves for work sometimes and I don\u2019t know why but it makes me uncomfortable. Which brings us to the issue i stated, I recently found out a couple weeks ago, that he gave her a key to our apartment. He didn\u2019t consult any of us on it, he just went ahead and got her a key to our apartment. \n\nI\u2019m finding problems attempting to express this to my roommate. The primary reason is the fact that he is on antidepressants to control his mood and when he is put in a situation where he\u2019s uncomfortable, he decides to scream and yell. My hesitation to express this is due to the fact that he will immediately feel ganged up on by the 3 roommates who believe she shouldn\u2019t have a key. She also just lost her job today, and it makes me worried that soon she might be living rent free in our apartment. Could use some assistance on how to handle the situation.", "created_utc": 1702002191, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dcaeg/aita_for_saying_my_roommates_girlfriend_cant_have/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Look at your lease. When I was in college, we nearly got evicted because one of my roommates was letting her boyfriend stay all the time and someone reported it (a neighbor). The other three of us begged our landlord to let the other three of us stay because our roommate was the one fighting with us for her boyfriend to be there and we wanted him gone too. He ended up just evicting her, but that left the three of us to cover rent. Approach your roommate calmly and explain the terms of the lease and if you have to tell him that the landlord or a neighbor has warned you about the extra person/car parking outside, use that to your advantage (the parking was how we got busted).", "NTA can you have a roommate meeting? Or just say something like, \u201cRoommate, I have to talk to you about something that\u2019s been on my mind. Can we talk about expectations how often ____ is over?\u201d I think if you can approach it kind of neutrally maybe it can be a discussion.

I don\u2019t imagine they would want someone not on the lease staying in the apartment, let alone having a key. Get your lease out and look at whether him giving her the key is in violation. The only thing I would caution you about contacting the landlord is that depending on the laws where you live the LL may evict him. That would probably increase your portion of the rent or necessitate getting another roommate.", "NTA. Either she kicks in on rent, or they both go.", "NTA\n\nShe is not a tenant. She should not have a key nor should she be staying long term unless she is paying rent. Speak to your landlord.", "Nta", "Melt downs be damned. Your roommate doesn't get to unilaterally give his girlfriend to the shared apartment.  She's already over too often, and with the job loss is most likely getting ready to move in until \"She's back on her feet.\"  Stop it now.\n\nYou and your other roommates are already uncomfortable with the situation. It's time to have a discussion.", "NTA\n\nI honestly had a really shitty roommate who did this exact thing without consulting my partner and I. One week he was out of town so we were enjoying not wearing pants and hanging out in the communal spaces. Suddenly, the front door became unlock and she walks in. We thought someone was breaking and entering. My partner has a gun on him and my ex roommate also owns guns and knew this. He put his girlfriend in harms way and she was just borrowing his printer? \n\nAnyways,  No matter how you approach this he is going to feel ganged up on. He clearly cannot handle confrontation which is why he did not consult you about it. My best advice is to look up some conflict resolution/ productive communication information online. Daft up a roommate contract so everyone is on the same page (makes him less singled out) about expectations of the household (who is allowed to visit, who can have a key, is the key for emergencies,  when do roommates need to notified about a visitor staying for several days, etc.) This going well honestly depends on your roommate. The roommate mentioned above would always bring up his depression whenever we tried to confront him about disrespectful and antisocial behavior.", "NTA\ni dont particularly mind when my roommates guests stay without the host home, or even if they are there long term. maybe there is a compromise you all can make of sorts? regardless, you should check your lease for rules about having copies of keys, and how often guests can stay. \nalso you shouldn\u2019t feel like you cant bring it up because of his reaction, even if its a result of mental illness.", "NTA\nHave a meeting with all five of you present and explain that keys are not free.
