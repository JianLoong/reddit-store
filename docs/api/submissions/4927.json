When you do talk to her, does she make eye contact? Nod along? Does she make a facial expression while you talk?

And are you expecting her to clean or cook for the friend or something? I'm not sure if this is what's bothering her, but if you're at a loss just think about it. She might be feeling undervalued.

Just to play devil's advocate, one of my teens has auditory process disorder and a receptive language disorder. It takes him longer to process what was being said, and sometimes he just doesn't know what to say. We're working with him on saying something at least, like \"I need a minute to process\" or \"just a sec I'm thinking.\" We've also tried to be more mindful about giving more space/opening for him to respond. Also, it's important to say their name and make sure they're looking at you/have their attention before speaking if it's something you really want to make sure they hear and acknowledge (at least in my ADD family where hyperfocus is a real thing, this is important).\n\nSo, when you are both calm, you could try to open a conversation about how you both have different communication needs and try to come to a compromise. \n\nThe deflection and comment about \"every stupid thing you say\" however, is uncalled for, and she owes you an apology.

She's very smart and very funny, a bit of an extrovert, and fun/easy to converse with. I'm told I'm the same way, just definitely an introvert. My girlfriend thinks out loud. Constantly. Between that, actual conversations with me, and chit chat with our cats, she's rarely quiet for long. It can be EXHAUSTING to have to always have my hearing and at least part of my brain focused on parsing what she's saying, discarding things that aren't meant for me, and processing/replying to things that are. I'm not proud that I don't always handle it with grace and patience, but it really can feel like somebody has commandeered your brain, and you're only allowed to have 60% of it for your own personal use, the rest is stuck processing THEIR thoughts.

It sucks that you\u2019re going through this OP, you deserve better.\n\nIt\u2019s also total bullshit that you tried to tell her how you feel about a thing and she was nasty to you about it. When you live and respect someone, civil discourse is important. Even if you think the other person is wrong, you should politely listen, think about is and have a calm, non judgmental discussion about it.

She will speak whatever thought runs through her head at any given moment, with or without context. There could be an extended period where literally every sentence she says could be completely unrelated to the previous one.

For example, can you ask her to give an answer to things that are immediately pressing, but let the other things go? For example, you say you're out of OJ, and she doesn't respond, just let that go. Write it on the grocery list. If it doesn't get picked up for some reason, it's not the end of the world. \n\nIf it's something immediately pressing, like \"Your mom is coming over later,\" then yes, you can ask for a response, especially if there are things you need to do before Mom gets there.

My hubby was like that, I tried explaining \"if you don't acknowledge you heard me in some way then how do I know you heard me?\" He still didn't get it. So one time I had something important to tell him, he didn't respond, so I left it at that. When it was time for that something important he says I didn't tell him. I said he's, I did, but you didn't answer like always and when I repeat it you fuss because \"you heard me\" so I assumed tou heard me. See why it's important for you to acknowledge you freaking heard me?\" He did ok for awhile. Then started doing it again. I told him I'd start doing the same to him. Whenever he'd say something I'd just not respond and he got aggravated and said why aren't you saying anything? I said well, you never respond when I'm telling you something so I thought you were fine with it. See how it feels? He usually responds now.", "NTA, however one thing to consider is how much you talk. If you\u2019re constantly saying things all day, dozens of times, looking for acknowledgement, it may get old. But I assume you\u2019re doing it a normal amount of times and deserve to know the message was received.\n\nMy wife sort of does this too but I feel you. Instead she acknowledges so low no one can hear her (friends have mentioned.) when I repeat or ask if she heard me she repeats but very very loud, almost yelling. Gentle whisper to yelling rather than raising her voice slightly.\n\nTo me this is all part of getting what you need and compromise so you\u2019re NTA.", "Nta.

At worst she's being disrespectful (and that's my opinion), at *best* you have wildly different communication skills that, if you don't resolve them, are going to affect your relationship in all kinds of subtle and serious ways. If you're invested, look into couples counselling. If you're not, or if she continues to insult you when you broach the subject that you are in fact a living breathing human being who exists and likes that acknowledged from time to time, remember the sink cost fallacy and consider if this is really going to make you happy long-term, or if you're just getting married because \"that's what everyone does next.\"\n\nNTA", "I would agree with this except her response was straight forward asshole behavior.

Because if he's here asking if HTA given the circumstances he describes, he probably isn't even aware she could be doing this to him?

I can relate, my older sister does this a lot. It is annoying and sometimes even hurtful, but I always bring it up to her when she has cooled down. I know it isn't good behavior, but she has always been standoffish and just doesn't realize she isn't speaking half the time, and says that she sometimes thinks of the answer in her head and doesn't repeat it out loud. There is a way through this, but both you and her have to communicate. If she is unwilling to, or if she gets angry or insults you every time you bring it up, then break up with her. You deserve someone who respects you.", "NTA is your gf 14?", "NTA but break up with her, you deserve better", "For a minute i was gonna chalk this up to different communication styles and say nobody is at fault.

I was taught that u give eye contact unless ur doing something that requires ur focus then I would just lean in closer as a indication that I'm listening to u. It's just basic human courtesy to acknowledge when someone is talking to u unless it's straight bs coming out of their mouths such as threats etc. Find a better gf though cuz even my fiance hasn't given me a response like that and what she said is mad disrespectful. Don't stand for that shit, don't lower ur value in this relationship.", "My husband has the same habit, though not as often as your gf. Reading this triggered me.

How do her friends handle this? \nCommunication is important in a relationship and I cannot imagine trying to build a family with someone who refuses to do the bare minimum. \nDo the two of you have actual conversations?
