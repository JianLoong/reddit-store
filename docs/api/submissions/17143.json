If he didn\u2019t want to, he could have stayed home on his call. It was super rude of him to stay on the entire time you were out together, and him not talking on the phone the entire time y\u2019all are doing activities together does not equal never being able to talk to his friends.", "NTA. That is really rude and I also don't like how he tried to blame you. Like he wasn't being rude, you were trying to control who he talks to. WTF? I feel like if he had said \"oh sorry, that was totally inconsiderate,\" this wouldn't be an issue. If he's doing an activity with you, he should be available to you. And if he makes a mistake (giving him the benefit of the doubt that he just got caught up on a call or saw w shopping as a chore rather than an activity) he should apologize sincerely, not blame you.", "NTA. He was being incredibly rude.", "NTA, it is rude to talk to friends while you are physical with another person.  But I do think your bf is not that interested in shopping with you.  I guess he feels entitled to be rude since he didn't want to be there.  Passive aggressive stuff like that is really a relationship issue.  He calls it controlling but he needs to be more direct about his needs.  You don't need to shop together but you do need couple time that both of you are mentally present for.", "NTA. He was being rude to you.", " I\u2019ll never understand how people can deliberately render themselves deaf in public like that. If I\u2019m anywhere close to people,I want to be able to hear if I need to.", "NTA - that is rude.", "NTA it was inconsiderate and rude  but why not wait until he was done of the phone and then go?", "Did you need his attention or input on what to buy? \n\nHe was on the phone when you left. Clearly, he was already involved in a conversation with other people... maybe you should have waited to go food shopping until he was finished??\n\nThis just sounds like a difference in perspective & a timing issue. You wanted a couples shopping day & he wanted to catch up with friends. Someone was just going to need to wait to get what they wanted. \n\nNAH", "Nope, you are NTA here.", "He doesn\u2019t give a crap about you my friend. You deserve better. NTA", "ESH\n\nForcing couples to shop together is a waste of time and pointless.  It's something that only looks nice on tv and in the movies.  No two people have the same type of shopping habits.  Some like to float around and touch everything, others treat it like a military mission with each isle mapped out.  \n\nPersonally I worked in a grocery store during my teens so I know where things are and I want to get in, get what I need and get the hell out.  I also enjoying listening to audiobooks while shopping so having another person with me makes that impossible.   \nHe is rude for keeping a call going and having headphones in the entire time.  You are the same for making him join.  Take turns or split chores as required.", "Unfortunately, for some couples, one \"partner\" treats the other as an accessory to his/her/their life rather than a true partner.  I hope this is not the case for the two of you.  NTA.", "NAH! You may think this is nice couple's thing to do. He may see shopping as a chore that needs to be done and he has always chatted with friends while doing it. I'd suggest shopping separately from now on.", "ESH. Yeah what he did was inconsiderate-ish but you sound a bit high maintenance expecting him to not talk to his friends - if this happened every time you went shopping then that\u2019s one thing but one time and you\u2019re upset? Food shopping doesn\u2019t require that much input I think what he did (as a one time thing) is NBD. Should\u2019ve waited to shop until after he got off the phone", "ESH He thought you were just wanting to get groceries. You thought it was an inexpensive date. You both need to discuss openly why you were upset to avoid a problem in the future. I would have waited until he was off the phone. He would have understood what this was if you told him. He shouldn\u2019t ever be on a phone call in public. It isn\u2019t just rude to you, it is rude to everyone around who has to hear it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also though, sometimes nice things couples do together don\u2019t work for you as a specific couple. My husband and I tried to cook together a couple times when we were first together, that\u2019s a nice thing couples do together\u2026. It doesn\u2019t work for us. We both know how to cook pretty well, but our different styles regarding  speed, recipe following, and cleanup made it stressful. Now we just don\u2019t cook together, and that\u2019s fine. \n\nMaybe bf hates shopping and gets through it by distracting himself with a podcast or phone conversation. Maybe shopping and chatting together is just not going to happen and you need to come up with another system. That\u2019s ok. Or maybe this was a one-time thing or something he is willing to change for next time. Communicate about it and figure it out together.", "NTA. \n\nYou weren't trying to keep him from talking to his friends. You were trying to engage with him while the two of you were out somewhere together.", "Because she asked, so to comply with her request but show he didn't want to do it he took the passive aggressive route of being on the phone the entire time. If he would just say \"no, I don't want to\" it would probably have saved this person a lot of time and stress.\n\nI would point out that the going shopping together thing seems to be entirely about her and her expectations, she doesn't say whether he finds it nice or even enjoys it at all, just that she does and therefore they should do it.", "Huh? Do you not ever speak to other people when you with your partner, family, kids...", "It\u2019s a food shop so yeah there were some things I wanted his opinion on and I agree maybe we should have waited, he was the one that asked if I was ready to leave and we should go then. Goes to show he didn\u2019t really think there was anything wrong with it", "No, wrong.", "I don't find grocery shopping \"nice\" and I do not enjoy it at all. I do find eating necessary, so I shop. If OPs boyfriend wants to eat, why shouldn't he participate in the shopping?", "No, however when I spend time with people I want to be there.  We are not talking about two people in the same home doing different activities.  They at a store, and her bf is ignoring her.", "He was killing 2 birds with 1 stone. Went shopping with you & caught up with friends. \n\nYou both just had a different expectations. You wanted to have an experience, he just wanted to get food. To avoid disappointment.... Next time tell him what you want to do (have fun time together while shopping) or just leave him at home.\n\nI think also think it\u2019s important to keep in perspective... you were running errands together not sitting at a table in the middle of a deep conversation at lunch.", "Agree to disagree", "I'm with you, it's a fucking chore but I do it because I want to eat. I don't try to dress it up as a nice couple's activity though. It's a PITA!", "They were doing chores.... this is probably a weekly routine activity that both of these people do by themselves with no problem. They weren\u2019t out trying to decide on new furniture. OP thought she was on a date, bf thought they were shopping for food. \n\nIn 32 yrs of marriage I can\u2019t recall a lot of magical in-depth conversations with my husband at the grocery store. We get in & get out... then treat ourselves to lunch", "Agree to be wrong", "Read the post again.  Op just wanted to ask normal questions about the shopping.  Op wasn't looking for a magical in-depth conversation, just company.  The BF resented it.  It really just rude to have a phone conversation when you are alone with another person.  It says I would rather not spend time with you.", "Talk about rude...", "Simple solution .... \u201coh you\u2019re on a call... okay finish your call & then we will go shopping. I will wait until you\u2019re done because I want your undivided attention on what food we should buy\u201d \n\nPeople have children, jobs, families, normal life things that happen ...  being on the phone when you\u2019re with your partner is not rude. They can talk you 24/7 ... maybe the people on the other end of the phone don\u2019t get that same opportunity. If any of our 4 kids, my mother or sisters call me when I\u2019m with my husband... I\u2019m taking the call. I don\u2019t care where we are. If it\u2019s not important I\u2019ll call them back if I need to. My husband needs to be on the phone... a lot for his job. That job pays all our bills ... I don\u2019t take it personally."]}
