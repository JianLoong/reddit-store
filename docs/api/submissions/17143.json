If he didn\u2019t want to, he could have stayed home on his call. It was super rude of him to stay on the entire time you were out together, and him not talking on the phone the entire time y\u2019all are doing activities together does not equal never being able to talk to his friends.", "NTA. That is really rude and I also don't like how he tried to blame you. Like he wasn't being rude, you were trying to control who he talks to. WTF? I feel like if he had said \"oh sorry, that was totally inconsiderate,\" this wouldn't be an issue. If he's doing an activity with you, he should be available to you. And if he makes a mistake (giving him the benefit of the doubt that he just got caught up on a call or saw w shopping as a chore rather than an activity) he should apologize sincerely, not blame you.", "NTA. He was being incredibly rude.", "NTA, it is rude to talk to friends while you are physical with another person.  But I do think your bf is not that interested in shopping with you.  I guess he feels entitled to be rude since he didn't want to be there.  Passive aggressive stuff like that is really a relationship issue.  He calls it controlling but he needs to be more direct about his needs.  You don't need to shop together but you do need couple time that both of you are mentally present for.", "NTA.

Clearly, he was already involved in a conversation with other people... maybe you should have waited to go food shopping until he was finished??\n\nThis just sounds like a difference in perspective & a timing issue. You wanted a couples shopping day & he wanted to catch up with friends.

Some like to float around and touch everything, others treat it like a military mission with each isle mapped out.  \n\nPersonally I worked in a grocery store during my teens so I know where things are and I want to get in, get what I need and get the hell out.  I also enjoying listening to audiobooks while shopping so having another person with me makes that impossible.   \nHe is rude for keeping a call going and having headphones in the entire time.

He may see shopping as a chore that needs to be done and he has always chatted with friends while doing it. I'd suggest shopping separately from now on.", "ESH. Yeah what he did was inconsiderate-ish but you sound a bit high maintenance expecting him to not talk to his friends - if this happened every time you went shopping then that\u2019s one thing but one time and you\u2019re upset? Food shopping doesn\u2019t require that much input I think what he did (as a one time thing) is NBD.

You both need to discuss openly why you were upset to avoid a problem in the future. I would have waited until he was off the phone. He would have understood what this was if you told him.

Also though, sometimes nice things couples do together don\u2019t work for you as a specific couple. My husband and I tried to cook together a couple times when we were first together, that\u2019s a nice thing couples do together\u2026. It doesn\u2019t work for us. We both know how to cook pretty well, but our different styles regarding  speed, recipe following, and cleanup made it stressful. Now we just don\u2019t cook together, and that\u2019s fine. \n\nMaybe bf hates shopping and gets through it by distracting himself with a podcast or phone conversation. Maybe shopping and chatting together is just not going to happen and you need to come up with another system. That\u2019s ok. Or maybe this was a one-time thing or something he is willing to change for next time.

If he would just say \"no, I don't want to\" it would probably have saved this person a lot of time and stress.\n\nI would point out that the going shopping together thing seems to be entirely about her and her expectations, she doesn't say whether he finds it nice or even enjoys it at all, just that she does and therefore they should do it.", "Huh? Do you not ever speak to other people when you with your partner, family, kids...", "It\u2019s a food shop so yeah there were some things I wanted his opinion on and I agree maybe we should have waited, he was the one that asked if I was ready to leave and we should go then.

We are not talking about two people in the same home doing different activities.  They at a store, and her bf is ignoring her.", "He was killing 2 birds with 1 stone. Went shopping with you & caught up with friends. \n\nYou both just had a different expectations. You wanted to have an experience, he just wanted to get food. To avoid disappointment.... Next time tell him what you want to do (have fun time together while shopping) or just leave him at home.\n\nI think also think it\u2019s important to keep in perspective... you were running errands together not sitting at a table in the middle of a deep conversation at lunch.", "Agree to disagree", "I'm with you, it's a fucking chore but I do it because I want to eat.

We get in & get out... then treat ourselves to lunch", "Agree to be wrong", "Read the post again.  Op just wanted to ask normal questions about the shopping.  Op wasn't looking for a magical in-depth conversation, just company.  The BF resented it.  It really just rude to have a phone conversation when you are alone with another person.

They can talk you 24/7 ... maybe the people on the other end of the phone don\u2019t get that same opportunity. If any of our 4 kids, my mother or sisters call me when I\u2019m with my husband... I\u2019m taking the call. I don\u2019t care where we are. If it\u2019s not important I\u2019ll call them back if I need to. My husband needs to be on the phone... a lot for his job. That job pays all our bills ... I don\u2019t take it personally.", "ESH\u2026 at first I was going to say NTA, because I agree that shopping together can be nice, and that I think your partner is the best friend you should ever have and to make them a priority.\n\nHowever, I made it ESH because I don\u2019t know the whole story. Like if all of his friends planned this call since a while back, and you didn\u2019t care and bugged him into coming with you, then of course YTA. Unless he calls hoods friends every day and typically ignores you, then again you\u2019d be NTA.", "NTA - Agree with all posts above but felt the need to point out the classic gaslighting going on here. He was the one that was rude and you expressed that it upset you and yet he's now turned it around on you for \"not letting him speak to his friends \" (which is a massive jump btw). Gaslighting is so subtle and sneaky sometimes, you didn't do anything wrong so don't feel the need to defend yourself.", "First question, why aren\u2019t you doing curbside or delivery do you don\u2019t have to go in the store to begin with?", "I find it weirder that all of his friends actually had a zoom call scheduled (does that ever happen) and that is grocery shopping day. She gets to be excited to do this mundane activity which is important to her and not have him make her feel stupid over it- but how did it end up at the same time as a group zoom when you can grocery shop literally any time and day of the week.", "Nah, grocery shopping is fun. Carrying the stuff in isn't.", "She did say they typically take turns.", "Just what you want when you\u2019re trying to spend time w your s/o!

Kind of like stopping for gas.", "If he doesn\u2019t want to go, he can use his words. If he wants to be on a call the whole time he should communicate that ahead of time so she can adjust her expectations of his potential involvement. If he doesn\u2019t want to shop as a couple he can say that (my SO did and I respect that). \n\nHe agreed to the trip and even selected when they left. At any point he could have voiced his opinion/wants/needs. He didn\u2019t. Instead he engaged in the type of behaviour you\u2019d expect from a 10 year old who was given no choice or voice in the matter. \n\nHis actions are disrespectful no matter which way you try to justify it. If he continues to use non-verbal passive-aggressive forms of communication then he will encounter issues in more than just his relationship.", "It\u2019s called a lack of communication. These people had different expectations. Neither of them are assholes. They both get a re-do ... another shopping experience & another call with friends. They were just on a different page in their story.", "No, being on a call while with another person who has specifically requested your presence in order to obtain your opinion is being an asshole. \n\nWhen your partner brings this up as an issue and they go from 0-60 (you don\u2019t want me talking to my friends) instead of actually dealing with the issue of it being a really disrespectful choice to go shopping with your earbuds in then that is more than just poor communication, that is a lack of respect for your partner.\n\nShe could definitely adjust her expectations as to what \u2018couple things\u2019 they do together. But that in no way makes her an asshole in this situation. \n\nI wear noise cancelling earphones regularly due to some medical issues and I would NEVER consider this appropriate etiquette with an SO or  anybody else. This was asshole behaviour 101.", "INFO. \n\nThis sounds like it is missing detail. Was this call already planned?\n\nAlso, you make no mention on if he actually wanted to go.", "NAH. Grocery shopping is a chore. It is not fun, and certainly not a \"nice couples thing to do.\" Nothing wrong with asking him to come along, but if he was already on a group call with his buds, why not just let him skip it? Or he should have felt free to politely decline. \n\nI prefer grocery shopping by myself. It gets done in half the time and I don't end up with a bunch of junk food.", "NTA\n\nHe doesn't view shopping together the same way you do. Leave him at home or send him with a list. Alternate. It's good for him.", "NTA. It\u2019s tough because I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong to feel how you feel, but I also wouldn\u2019t want my partner to view food shopping as a couples thing.", "NTA.\n\nIf he had a scheduled FaceTime with friends, he could've declined going with you, or suggested to go later after the call was done. If you agree to go somewhere with someone, no matter how mundane the task, you can't just ignore that other person.\n\nThat said, how did he respond when you asked him about shopping together? No one likes being forced to do something they don't want to. However, you should sit down and have a convo with him. \n\nPerhaps he doesn't like slowly walking around. He wants to get in and get out, but you like to peruse. Maybe you can work out a routine. Maybe you alternate going grocery shopping. And once in a while so it together. \n\nHowever, if you are doing something together, he should at least respect you and not be on the phone the entire time. I get that sometimes calls happen. For quick calls and important calls, by all means take it. But if it can wait 30mins, he can call back. It's all common sense. Would he do the same with other people or one of his friends that he's hanging out with? No, right?", "ESH. Did you make it clear this was a \"couple's activity\"? If I was asked to accompany someone on a chore like in this situation I'd probably say \"I can go if you need the help but I'll be on a call while we're there\". Both of you needed to communicate.", "Right? It's a safety thing.", "I grocery shop with my SO all the time. It's not a planned thing that we do. It's more of a, do you a do you want to come. It's just easier sometimes to go together as we remind each other of things we might forget. So we end up shopping together 80% of the time. I don't think it's all that weird. But the key thing is we're not forcing each other to do anything. We both want to.", "Did you read the post? \n\n>sometimes I do it and sometimes he does", "The first line says they both do the shopping...", "I can understand if this is the first time you've lived with a boyfriend, you'd be excited. Going to IKEA together, going food shopping, planning meals, you feel like a real adult! I think it's sad he doesn't share her excitement.", "I despise grocery shopping and have even gone hungry before because I didn't have food at home but didn't want to be bothered going to the store. Going with a partner is an entirely different experience and I actually do find it kinda nice.", "That would make me crazy. Can\u2019t we take turns to minimize the pain of the chore?", "I mean if that works for you yeah, but some people (myself among them) find that going together minimizes the chore more effectively than going half as frequently but by myself every time. It's all about what works for you and your relationship. OP and their bf need to talk thru this and figure out how it works best for them.", "And all your reasonings for taking a call are valid. However, in this particular situation it shouldn't be all on her. HE could've said, no I don't want to go. Or no, I can't go because I have FaceTime scheduled. OR hey, can we go later after my call is done. Why is it all on her? This wasn't a job call or an important call. He was talking to his friends. Why did he go grocery shopping at all if that call was so important? If it was unscheduled, then he should've said he'll call them back after he's done and at home. Don't agree to go do something if you're just going to be rude to the other person."]}
