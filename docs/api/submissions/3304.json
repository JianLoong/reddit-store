He texted me that I HAD to, because I stole his girlfriend (we are engaged now), and is giving me a really hard time. He texted all my family and fianc\u00e9. Now my parents are telling me to hire him or at least help him get a job with me but given his entitlement I really now don\u2019t feel like it. Yesterday he called me and said to me that I was an entitled piece of shit that wouldn\u2019t do anything for his family and I responded accordingly telling him to fuck off and that he has never worked for absolutely anything in life and that\u2019s why my fianc\u00e9 dumped him.

All I am going to say is, never hire family. It always end badly especially if you're in management and need to discipline him.\n\nNever hire family.

Also you didn't steal his girlfriend. It always bugs me when people use that terminology. She broke up with him and chose to date you of her own free will, because she wanted to. And he doesn't own her she can date whoever the hell she wants.", "NTA - it would be self destructive to allow him to emotionally blackmail you\n\nyour fiancee wised up to him years ago .  Does he go after men who dated other women who dumped him, expecting to be compensated in some way ?  His sense of entitlement surely makes him a terrible employee.  He won't work and will blame you when he gets fired.", "ESH. \n\nMaybe you did steal her, maybe you didn't, or maybe she's an adult who gets to make up her own mind about who to date and not a prize to be won. I don't know how it went down, but there's certainly plenty enough ways for it to cause pain. It's probably a sensitive subject, at the very least. \n\nBut it was also 8 years ago, and bro kinda needs to get over it. Like, bringing it up as a way to get the last piece of pizza is one thing, demanding you give him a job over it is another. Hell, demanding you give him a job, ever, for any reason at all, is a pretty hard AH move. And yes, that still applies to family. \n\nBut your response? Not cool. You don't need to trust him to just get him an interview. If he's a bad as you say then he'll flunk the interview and it's done. You fulfilled your obligation by getting him the chance to prove himself, and if you are wrong about him then the interview is his chance to prove that. \n\nInstead you refused to even give him that much, and instead chose to insult him and belittle him. How did you expect that to go? And bringing up your fianc\u00e9 dumping him? God damn, dude. That's just unnecessarily harsh. \n\nYou had the chance to just give him an interview and let him take his future into his own hands. Instead you blew up your family. Was one interview really too much for you? Do you hate this guy that much?", "NTA.  and Y T A\n\nYou definitely should not hire him, that\u2019s nepotism and you should not go poo where you work. He has showed you his true colors when you said no. Imagine if he acted like that at work. Then you would have to fire him and the family would be mad at that. If he wanted to do something at work and you said no, he would keep pushing just like he is here. You need to get out in front of the horrible things he has said about you by telling them the truth. \n\nI get slightly irritated at the comment, I work hard for my money. Yes, we all do you don\u2019t get extra points for that. Some people say things like I pay GOOD money to live here. As opposed to bad money? When tenants get mad they often say that or I pay my rent (dues) on time. That\u2019s good because everyone else who lives there does too. The ones that doesn\u2019t pay have to go. \n\nYou should never had said that he never worked for absolutely anything in life. Not only is that rude and sanctimonious but it\u2019s likely not completely true. But by telling him off like that, even if he deserves it puts you in bad light. You had a little temper tantrum with him and telling him to F puck off. That\u2019s completely unprofessional. That gives him something legitimate to complain about to your family. Remember you represent your company and wen discussing that in any way, you need to be professional. You have now shown everyone that you have a temper and call people names. Surely that\u2019s not how you want your company to look. \nThere have been plenty of times I wanted to say something like that but never did. I\u2019m too well known within my career. I even watch what I post on social media because you never know who might look at it and judge you.", "Plus they were together for 3 months not exactly a long term relationship and at the time the girl was 17", "She is free to dump the cousin and date someone else. Women aren't prizes , property etc", "You are 100% correct, women aren't prizes or property. No where did I ever say that.\n\nBut if you know you have a friend who is seeing someone and you intentionally intercept that relationship, you are a bad person. At the very least you wait until they break up and have a little time to recover.\n\nThe way the post is worded, it sounds like they were already screwing around while their cousin was seeing this woman. Further, the amount of animosity OP has for their cousin in their post makes me believe they knew what they were doing but didn't care.\n\nThe woman in this situation isn't the asshole, although I would argue that dating within the same family does kind of make you a jerk. But OP sure could have practiced some self restraint.", "NTA. Not only is it a terrible idea to hire relatives under any circumstances, but your cousin trying to bully you into hiring him is a huge red flag that would lead to endless new problems. He might feel entitled to come in late, do a bad job, and take advantage of you in all sorts of ways. You\u2019d also be putting your own employment at risk. You owe him nothing. If anything he owes YOU an apology for his childish attempt at bullying, cursing at you and being disrespectful. Your fianc\u00e9 was right to dump him and after eight years, any normal person would have moved on after a 3-month relationship ended.\n\nEdit:typo", "NTA.  You do not owe anyone a job", "NTA but your comment may have been a bit out of line. Definitely don\u2019t hire him though, yikes.", "This is a very wise perspective on the situation.", "And a cousin isn\u2019t really the same thing as a brother/sister/best friend. I mean, the last time I saw my cousin probably was when I was a freshman in college which was uh, a long time ago.", "ESH, you\u2019re absolutely not wrong to not put yourself on the line to get him a job, but it\u2019s super scummy to date a family members ex.", "OP=NTA\n\nblunt, but deserved.  Don't give in, you do not want your employment jeopardized by his lack of work ethic.  \n\nTell family members cranking at you, that they are welcome to get him a job at their places of employment.  Cause I get the feeling, it will be ALL those relatives, to keep him employed.", "Completely not, yeah the way you meet your fianc\u00e9 may not ideal, however, no relationship is a guarantee so there would always be chance or likelihood that she would end the relationship for any other reason.\n\nHe has not right to demand that you get him a job, it\u2019s up to him to put the work in himself and get something.\n\nGiven what you said about your education/background you either work in a job that requires specialist knowledge or drive with expected highly committed employees from the employer. If you think he doesn\u2019t have the skills, education then you should not help him as I can bet he wouldn\u2019t last long. Also, his behaviour and attitude could reflect on you if you gave a job or good recommendation to your employer.\n\nDefinitely, NTA, if he needs a job, he has to make the effort in getting a job and employer that he is worth the risk. Or shock/horror get entry level or min wage job to give him some money but not much.", "NTA stop having anything to so with this person", "Nta after that phone call. You should be relieved.", "all of u are assholes.", "NTA, but I do think you\u2019re gross for going after your cousins ex. But that\u2019s just me.", "brilliant assessment.", "why should he risk his own professional integrity just for his cousin to flunk the interview? it\u2019ll reflect badly on OP. NTA"]}
