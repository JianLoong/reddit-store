You\u2019re doing kind things for someone you really don\u2019t know THAT well. Having said that, I\u2019d probably wash the dishes just to get them out of the way and keep bugs out of your place. That wouldn\u2019t take THAT much more time. But you sure don\u2019t need to worry about her meals. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going through exactly but she can certainly make herself some food when she wants or needs it. Also she may not be overly interested in eating when you are so I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong to cook for one.", "NTA. You have been kind enough to make coffee a few times, breakfast etc. Still she wants you to do her chores....\n\n\nYou have no kids together, no special relationship etc. You are not responsible for her health or her dishes.\n\n\nI suggest to not make her dinner.

You moved in 2 weeks ago and already she is showing abusive signs.", "NTA\n\nI thought you meant sick like ... she had the flu for a day.\n\nBut this is something different.

You gave her the little finger and she took your whole hand. Obviously she can't handle ppl doing nice things for her, she immidiately jumps to the conclusion that she is entitled to you doing her chores and can be rude to you. You are being nice and all she sees is a doormat she can easy take advantage of (and as you see, its working, you already feel guilty not doing more for her). \n\nStop with the nice stuff immidiately before she starts to become so demanding and entitled you will have no other option than to find new housing or get bullied till one of you moves out.", "Helping someone with depression (which is NOT OP's job) is a tricky thing.\n\nSometimes it's the need to do the very essentials that is the only thing that gets them moving.\n\nOut of food?

But I tend to refrain from washing too many dishes, as I have some sort of allergy? from dish liquid and I have to apply topical medication for it. The more I wash the faster my hands get eczema. It won't happen quickly if I wash just a few more of her dishes but I tend to wash as little as possible. But it's not the major issue as I can control it when I want.\n\nI was thinking of washing her dishes, but it's the 'expectation' of doing it is what made me a little irritated. She has a habit of stocking the sink to the top as she has lots of dishes and I don't want to end up cleaning them all the time."]}
