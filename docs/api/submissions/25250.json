You don't need to assume care of her because she's making you feel guilty, that is emotionally manipulative of her. If you want to help her, that's great, but the *moment* it feels like an obligation then check in with yourself. It is okay to say No to her, even if she doesn't understand.

I\u2019ve been the depressed roommate. What she needs is grace and a support system of her own, not to rely on a new roommate she just met. That\u2019s not an appropriate thing for her to ask. \n\nOP, going forward, dealing with a depressive episode I think a fair thing to ask of you is that you give her a little grace, a little wiggle room for not functioning as she would otherwise. Maybe she doesn\u2019t do her dishes every day, but she does a big wash a couple times a week. Fine. Not optimal, but a little wiggle room for human imperfection. \n\nThat said, when you are depressed and everything is hard, one of the things you have to prioritize is hygiene. Dirty dishes aren\u2019t just messy, they\u2019re unhygienic. She shouldn\u2019t be making your living space uninhabitable. If her depression is truly so bad that she can\u2019t keep basic hygiene, what she needs is medical help and/or help from whatever support network she\u2019s got. \n\nGoing forward, this might look like excusing a little clutter in the shared spaces when her depression limits her energy so much that she HAS TO prioritize hygienic safety. If she\u2019s only got the energy to drag herself out of bed to wash dishes and swish mouthwash around her mouth, give her a little grace for that stack of jackets and old mail in the common area. \n\nThere\u2019s no harm in asking if there\u2019s something you can do to help her do her adulting. Maybe once in a while she will ask you to do the dishes. But if she regularly is too depressed to keep the living space clean, that\u2019s not something she should rely on you, a relative stranger, to do. She needs to call her friends/parents/doctor.", "NTA I wouldn't do to much for her even if you feel bad. You've already been doing a little bit and see hows she's acting?

Why aren't you cleaning up her dishes? It goes on and on. DO NOT make her food for dinner. Just go about your business. If she tells you she needs you to do x, y. or Z for her; let her know that she should probably make arrangements with her friends/family or a paid service because you cannot and will not be her long-term care provider. You've done some nice things for her, but that doesn't mean that you are now obligated to keep doing those things. If she can't handle her affairs, she should probably move back to her family.", "NTA\n\nYes environment yes yes but as someone who has an alphabet of mental health issues, including major depressive, *paper plates*. \n\nI don't mind washing up my fork, spoon or knife if there is a paper plate I don't have to clean. If it really bothers her about the environment (I still feel a lot of guilt some days) I'm sure there are recycled paper plates and they don't have to be used daily.

It\u2019s totally inappropriate for her to start asking all of this of a new roommate and relative stranger. Depression is no joke. It\u2019s not something most people can manage on their own.
