As my country mandates child support even during university, we could live off of that until I graduated in 2019. Since then, I have been supporting both of us with my junior role salary. Needless to say, it\u2019s been tough, especially since inflation skyrocketed this year, but I managed to keep us afloat.\nThe issue right now is not the fact that I can\u2019t move out or gain independence because I need to support her. The real issue is that nothing I seem to do is ever enough: I don\u2019t do enough chores, I can\u2019t afford to get her new clothes or take her on vacations, I spend my free time relaxing when I should be doing something useful, etc. She will throw an honest to God tantrum about this on the regular. It\u2019s gotten to a point where I can\u2019t watch a single episode of a show because I\u2019ll get interrupted and possibly screamed at. \nLast Friday night she decided it was time for deep cleaning and I really couldn\u2019t do it. Work had made me lose sleep all week and I couldn\u2019t handle cleaning at 10pm after everything. She used this to start one of her tantrums: \u201cThis is why I can\u2019t have a job, I have to be your maid. It\u2019s your fault\u201d. I had paid a cleaning service just the day before because I knew I hadn\u2019t been able to put in as much work as usual. This was the last straw. \nI yelled at her that I\u2019m sacrificing a big chunk of my life just to support her and nothing I ever do is enough for her. I might\u2019ve also alluded that she does seem to have enough time to use Tinder daily instead of job searching.\nObviously, she didn\u2019t take this well and called me an ungrateful brat. Which is exactly when I basically told her \u201cpot kettle\u201d.\nWhile I think I have the right to be frustrated with my situation, in my culture mothers are almost holy so it\u2019s hard to tell if I\u2019m in the right or not.

Just move out. If you feel guilty about it, leave her enough money for a month of expenses and print out a few job postings that she can follow up on after you're gone. This might be a cultural difference though. NTA.", "NTA, it is not your responsibility to provide for your mother, it's time for you to move out and enjoy your independence.", "NTA. And that part of your culture sucks. Any culture where kids have to respect their parents no matter what is basically societal narcissism. It enables the older generation to mistreat the younger generation, and then that younger generation who is traumatized and emotionally stunted due to being abused grows up, and when they have the power they take it out on their kids and the cycle goes on and on.\n\nAnd yes, what I am arguing is that aspects of certain cultures are objectively bad. And no, this is not racist, because I'd argue that one of the big offenders of a narcissistic culture is post-WW2 United States, where the social norms were basically the narcissistic man's ultimate fantasy.", "Your mother is trying to guilt you into supporting her for the rest of her life. Yet she\u2019s obviously known that her support would end when you graduated. In other words, she had many years to prepare for your graduation, yet here you are nearly five years afterward. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t intend to get a job, no matter what she says.

You might have more empathy and understanding for her situation after marriage and or children  however,  that doesn't change the hell,  burden of responsibilities, and extreme  hardships being placed on you and especially so young. Not only are you not the AH but what you have done and have continuing  to  be doing  atm is nothing short of unreal and amazing.  Your mother sacrificed her life for unpaid work and labour.  it's a horrible situation to be faced with during and after divorce. The only thing you can do is help her independently financially support herself at 68 none the less once you are gone. This isn't a burden for you to bear. Once again, not AH.", "Time to assert some control and boundaries. If she is not going to contribute financially to the household, she needs to contribute in other ways. If she refuses? You can refuse to support her any more. She is playing a dangerous game of chicken of your sense of loyalty vs your financial and emotional well being.
