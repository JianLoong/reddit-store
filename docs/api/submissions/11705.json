My niece is 8 years old and lost her dad two years ago. He was not a stable presence in her life. While my sister was pregnant he fell down the rabbit hole of addiction and never could recover from that. My niece was traumatized by his death because she was with him at the time. My sister put her in therapy and was concerned but believed she would be fine if things stayed the same.\n\nJer is a divorced dad with four kids. The oldest is 19 and doesn't live with him, the other three are 16, 14 and 13. He has primary custody of the younger three. My niece, I'll call her Elle for the sake of the post, desperately wants to be accepted by her stepsiblings. But she goes about it in very counterproductive and manipulative ways. She has lied to Jer and my sister about them saying mean things, she has broken into their rooms and when they get annoyed with her, she tells her parents she had permission. She'll beg to go along whenever they're going out and has thrown some pretty major tantrums over them not wanting her to go. She's young and she's dealt with serious trauma. I think it could all be related. My sister's stepkids complain about Elle all the time and it annoys my sister and Jer. They think the kids are bullying her and being mean. The oldest doesn't go around because of the stuff he's heard about Elle. \n\nA couple of weeks ago we were at my parents house and Elle was telling me how the 16 year old had promised to take her to see a new movie she wanted. The 16 year old said they had not and told Elle she was a liar. Elle started to cry and told me the 16 year old was being mean and they had to keep their promise to her. My sister overheard and said she was tired of Elle being picked on. Other times Elle has told me they can't not spend time with her. That they're her siblings now and don't get to do sibling stuff without her. She also told me she doesn't want them going to their mom's again and wishes she would just go away.\n\nSo after the party at our parents, when nobody else was around, I spoke to my sister. She was telling me how her stepkids were such a disappointment and how angry it makes her that they're such a big problem and poor Elle, etc. I told her her stepkids are not the problem and that it's understandable they don't like when Elle lies. My sister claimed she doesn't. I told her Elle needs help. That it's not healthy to force yourself into situations and to make up things to get your way and I suggested that she needs help. I told her it can be hard to get along with someone who is willing to get you into trouble just to make you spend time with them. My sister accused me of not knowing what I was talking about and told me I was blaming Elle when she's the victim.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678183765, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kv9gc/aita_for_telling_my_sister_her_stepkids_arent_the/", "score": 541, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your niece needs help. You mention that she was in therapy; is still attending? I think seeing a professional with experience with children and trauma would be a very good idea for this little girl. I understand that your sister doesn't want to think her daughter is at fault, but her child's behaviour will only alienate her from her stepsiblings and ignoring it is not helping anyone.", "NTA. It\u2019s not even appropriate for an eight-year-old to be where teenagers are hanging out unless it\u2019s specifically a kids activity, this is weird if she just trying to pawn off her mother and duties on the teenage kids? They aren\u2019t a free babysitter.  And I believe the kid was lying about the movies why would a 16-year-old promise to take an eight-year-old to the movies and then go back on that and then lie about it? Seems more likely to eight year old is the liar. Thank you for sticking up for the other kids when nobody else will.", "NTA - but your sister definitely is for refusing to see what\u2019s going on with Elle and not intervening. Dumping the kid in therapy is obviously not helping, and it\u2019s so wrong of her to further alienate the step children.", "NTA. Elle needs more help. It seems like she seeks love and attention. She doesnt mean no harm, it is her trauma.", "NTA.  Sounds like you recognize the issues Ellie has and understandably she would have issues.  I hope Ellie gets the help she needs.", "NTA -> \"That they're her siblings now and don't get to do sibling stuff without her. She also told me she doesn't want them going to their mom's again and wishes she would just go away.\"\n\nStraight away that just screams attachment/abandonment issues to me. I think you're spot on with the fact she needs help and before it escalates further. Lying is one thing, but if this is left unchecked and untreated, who knows how bad and how fast it will get before her mom sees the truth.", "NTA. You simply made a fair observation and you should be able to vocalise your concerns with your sister.", "Not at all", "NTA\n\nYour sister has to hear the truth even if it hurts. Her step kids need to be honest with her too. Elle needs some sort of professional help.", "NTA. You said what needed to be said.\n\nThat kid needs help and support. She's grown to the age of 8 as an only child and has suddenly gained 3 step brothers. She no doubt sees the rapport they have and desperately wishes to be a part of it and doesn't know how to attract the positive attention to make this happen.\n\nI'm not sure when Elle started therapy and how long it went for, but my guess is it shouldn't stop for many years yet. She's been through trauma and change that not many kids endure. \n\nThe boys also are old enough to start using positive reinforcement to help Elle go the right way about getting herself included. They can't do this alone though and need a lot of support as well. \n\nA difficult situation, but far from impossible. I wish you, your sister and all involved the best of luck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like you're spot on and your sister doesn't want to accept that her child has behavioral problems.", "NTA.   This is tough, as there's no good answer.  Do you think you could sue for custody?  I know it would be an unusual course of action.  But I fear the kids life is ruined if she stays with her enabling bio-mom.  She might be better off with uncle who is wise to her tricks.  Maybe you could mold her into a decent young lady.", "I think it has already alienated her from them. They seem like good kids so they don't go out of their way to say anything to her that would hurt or anything but I get the sense they want as little to do with her as possible and I can't blame them under the circumstances. She's not currently in therapy. The therapist she was seeing retired or left the field and my sister thought she was doing well and didn't seek out someone else.", "This was my thinking also. Besides that, given the turbulent relationship there already, why would the teenager sign themselves up for more obligation to Elle when the dislike is very clear? But my sister and her husband do not see it.", "Right she dumped the kid in therapy and now she\u2019s trying to dump the kid on the other kids.", "The OP mentioned in another comment she\u2019s not in therapy. Her old therapist moved on. Mom never found her a new one.   \n\n\nThe step kids are now therapy. /humor", "Absolutely not! \nThe description, with her backstory, screams separation anxiety to me. To take her away from her now family, especially the mother, would worsen everything for Elle. \nIf the sister doesn't come around soon, maybe take it up to Jer. \nHe should also know if this is new behaviour from his children or if they had been accused of bullying before (school, cousins, etc.).\nTheir dad might be more open to the concept of not everything beeing their fault - also if the idea of putting only Elle in therapy seems to daunting for them, I think family counselling would be a good shot here anyway.", "Losing a parent in front of you is not something she will be \u201cover\u201d in two years. She needs ongoing therapy and her mom needs to find a new one. That is troubling behavior for an 8 year-old and apparently mom is enabling it. NTA.", "Jer is not more open. He's just as hard on his own kids and only sees the worst in them over this. It's sad because the kids really only have him, their mom is a complicated matter, and I don't see this ending well for any of them if it continues.", ">Absolutely not! The description, with her backstory, screams separation anxiety to me. To take her away from her now family, especially the mother, would worsen everything for Elle. \n\nThat's a catch-22 situation, though.  Mom is part of the problem.  Staying with mom makes her worse.  Taking her away from mom makes her worse.  Damn...", "Oh dear, what a mess. \nAnd the family-therapy option? Do you think they'd be open to getting help for all of them? Because I think a therapist might be able to better understand Elles' behaviour and explain what's going on to them. Also, outsider opinions are often easier to digest than those of family/friends...", "I think my main concern would be they would not get a good therapist and that they would dismiss issues within the practice if things were going their way, or what was being said is what they want to hear. The only way I could see it maybe working is with my sister and Jer on their own or with Elle only and leave Jer's kids out for now. But even then, I'm not sure I will be listened to after this.", "NTA\n\nI foresee that Jer is about to lose primary custody due to the children's wishes, if he and your sister don't knock it off with forcing a manipulative 8-year-old on them.", "NTA. I would also point this out. Very few teenage boys want to constantly hang out with an 8 year old girl.", "NTA.  The step kids need to start recording Elle whenever they interact with her.  Then when Elle starts up with her lies the older kids can pull out the recording and play it for them.  Your sister can't say the older kids are bullying Elle and that Elle is telling the truth when the proof is in the recording that Elle is full of it and the older kids aren't bullying her.\n\nYou need to have that conversation with Elle again but record it this time.  Your sister will then be confronted with Elle's unrealistic expectations of her step siblings and how she doesn't want them to continue to go to their mother's house. \n\nAfter your sister hears all of the audio recordings then maybe she'll change her tune about Elle being the \"victim\" and realize she needs help.  Elle's becoming someone that no one will want to be around when she's older.", "NTA.  You are absolutely correct and giving your sister excellent advice, but I think you are tilting at windmills here.  Your sister isn\u2019t going to listen to you, she\u2019s made up her mind that Elle is the victim here because that\u2019s a much easier narrative than admitting Elle has become a monster, enforcing some boundaries and getting her some help.", "Many assholes here OP, You're one of them though.", "The mother won't be taking primary custody of them. Sadly they don't have that option so they'll be stuck with him and my sister.", "Wtf?! Sue for custody of the niece?! What alternate reality do you live in where this would be possible? And \u2018mold her into a decent young lady\u2019? I don\u2019t even what to know what you think that is. Niece needs therapy, not to be ripped away from her family. She\u2019s already experienced enough trauma.", "Maybe recommend that the teens record some of her behavior to show to the parents. Video/audio doesn't lie...", "The common denominator here is mom \u201cdumping\u201d her own daughter on others instead of engaging as a parent.", "NTA, in 2, 4 & 5 years Jer is gonna lose all contact with his children, if not sooner. Seems to me that recording their interactions with Elle is the only way to go about convincing the parents that Elle isn't being bullied.\n\nAnd also get Elle back into therapy omg", "NTA.  I'm worried for your sister stepkids. How long before Elle's lies escalate to a serious allegation that gets the authorities involved  I don't  blame the 19 year old for staying as far away from this situation as they possibly can. I hope your sister and husband see the light before the worse happens and the step kids are having to defend themselves in the legal system from Elle's false accusations.", "NTA. I see you mentioned she was in therapy but isn't anymore. Imo your sister needs to get her back into therapy on her own and maybe look into family therapy as well so that way the therapist has both sides of the stories and may be better suited to explain things from a professional stand point for your sister and Jer.", "NTA. Those kids are going to quit going to their fathers house soon. Or will simply move out the second they get a chance and not look back. I feel so bad for them.\nElle needs therapy yesterday. She\u2019s in for a miserable life if she keeps this crap up", "NTA this poor kid needs help, and the longer this goes, the harder life is going to be from her.  It won't just be her stepsiblings, it will be her classmates, friends, coworkers, etc.", "NTA. \n\nBut I would shoot one of the older kids a text or an email through social media. That they need to tell their mother what is going on, that she can call you for clarification. But that the kids need to be with mom full time before your niece goes farther and tries to really hurt the step kids because she's not getting her way.", "The age gap in an of itself is a problem. The youngest at 13 doesn't have much in common with an 8 year old. Never mind the other issues. At least mom, dad and Elle should be in some sort of family counseling.", "OP, suggest to your sister\u2019s step kids to record a few of the situations and only show it to their dad so he can see Elle\u2019s inappropriate behavior for himself and then he can talk to his wife. Elle definitely needs more therapy because losing one\u2019s parent and actually being there is extremely traumatic. \n\nMy daughter when she was 11 lost her dad suddenly due to his addiction but thank goodness she wasn\u2019t with him. She is 17 and is still in therapy because she still struggles with anxiety and separation issues. I\u2019ve never let her be alone with him and would only allow supervised visits, not sure why your sister let Elle be alone with her dad who had chemical abuse issues. \n\nActually both Elle and your sister will benefit from therapy otherwise Elle\u2019s issues will escalate.", "That won't be happening unfortunately. Mom won't ever be taking full custody of them.", "She didn't have much of a choice. The courts gave him unsupervised weekends with her (every other weekend) and sometimes he actually took those weekends. My sister fought against it but lost.", "How so?", "Someone needs to encourage the stepkids to tell mom what's going on and let her know that dads house is damaging and abusive to those poor kids. Someone needs to let the mom know so she can get a lawyer involved. \n\nOtherwise you need to call child services and report an abusive home.", "More like, the mother put in a token effort but gives up/takes the easiest option when things get hard", "That\u2019s a very tough situation, my ex husband luckily never challenged his visitation rights and I was able to arrange supervised visitation with his parents always being present. Still I still think that both your sister and Elle will benefit from individualized and family therapy. It definitely helped me and my daughter. Little Elle is hurting and taking it out on her step siblings, which isn\u2019t fair to them.", "NTA", "NTA. Apparently, your niece and sister both need help.", "The sister and her husband need therapy too as they are enabling this behavior and have their eyes closed not seeing the problems right in front of them.", "Why?", "I would suggest that your sister also attend therapy. Therapy for children isn\u2019t some magic trick to make bad behaviors go away. The parents need to be involved, open to working on their own problems, and willing to make changes to support healthy coping behaviors and emotion regulation. Studies show that parental involvement in therapy improves externalizing behaviors and overall functioning in this population. \n\nYour sister seems very defensive, so she would benefit from therapy regardless. However, this characteristic may also make her more averse to genuine participation. Regardless, it\u2019s with a shot.", "NTA! She needs to hear it. She needs to be aware of her kids behavior. Elle is not the victim. Elle terrorizes the house. When the other kids leave and go NO CONTACT the reason will be dad's wife and her daughter.", "NTA. On top of everything else, it's not reasonable to expect teenagers to hang out with an 8 year-old. It seems to me parents expect step-siblings to be much closer than they would of related siblings.", "The niece needs to have an environment with regular family activities (or activities with the parents and any stepsibling that wants to participate) and a lot of time she spends with friends of her age. It sucks to be the youngest,  but you can't force kids to take younger ones along with them if they do not want to. For children 8 to 13 is a huge gap, even siblings that grow up together, once they hit puberty they tend to ignore the younger ones till those hit puberty, too. \nI wonder if the niece so desperately wants to be close with her stepsiblings because she can not imagine grown ups to be around for a long time any more. Her faith in the longevity of parents may be severely shaken. Also people after loosing someone tend to claim a lot of affection because it needs a lot of love to refill the gap. She lost one parent, maybe friends and neighbours, too, when she moved in with the stepfamily. I hope her mom finds a good therapist and is able to spend a lot of time with her girl.", "NTA\n\nPoor step kids, looks like nobody is in their corner except you. Have them hang up video camera and record everything. They shall soon see the 8 year old lying. Also get those kids locks on their door so she can\u2019t ruin their stuff. \n\nTell the stepkids to tell their mom, and say if they want to live with mom instead. Or another relative? \n\nEvil stepmother over there is just awful.", "NTA. Holy shit, I feel bad for everybody here", "NTA. Clearly your niece really needs help sorting through her trauma and learn how to co exist with her step siblings in healthier ways.", "And if they doooo that's kind of concerning", "> Losing a parent in front of you is not something she will be \u201cover\u201d in two years.\n\nI had a student in his junior year of high school who had found his mother on the bathroom floor, dead from an overdose. At 17, he was still in therapy. \n\nIt really messes up a child,  and Elle is dealing with it the only way she knows. It\u2019s a terribly sad situation.", "NTA.\n\nI wonder; if your niece is lying about her step siblings this much, then I wonder whether or not she\u2019s been labeled as a liar at her school. \n\nYour sister needs to step up and put an end to this now before your niece becomes ostracized at home and at school. I feel bad for those step kids.", "Definitely NTA\n\nTrying to force kids to like/spend time together will never be successful in bringing them close in any way.  It will only increase the resentment and push ones being pushed further away.\n\nAlso, look at these kids' ages, what 13+ year old wants to hang out with an 8 year old?  The lying and drama causing would only make them dislike her more.\n\nYour niece, definitely needs therapy.\n\nI hope your sister's step-kids have the option of going to their mom's whenever they want, because they definitely need somewhere to escape to.\n\nYour sister and her husband definitely T A's.  Husband especially for immediately taking a child with MH issues side over his children's without really looking into what is going on.  I am assuming these kids did not demonstrate bullying type behaviors prior the joining of family.\n\nHopefully your sister will realize her daughter needs help NOW so she can transition into teen and adult years without the issues that make her someone to avoid.", "NTA you\u2019re not wrong for saying something, she\u2019s just looking for attention. Unfortunately, she is going about it in a negative way Maybe the older kids could designate one day say every week or possibly two weeks where they go out and do something together. It sounds like she\u2019s trying to fit in but in the wrong way. Maybe if the older ones were just a little bit nicer and paid a little bit more attention to her she would learn that you don\u2019t get things when you act like that. However, you do get rewarded when you do well.", "NTA but the entire family probably needs therapy, not just Elle. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle."]}
