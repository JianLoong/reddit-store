My niece is 8 years old and lost her dad two years ago. He was not a stable presence in her life. While my sister was pregnant he fell down the rabbit hole of addiction and never could recover from that. My niece was traumatized by his death because she was with him at the time. My sister put her in therapy and was concerned but believed she would be fine if things stayed the same.\n\nJer is a divorced dad with four kids. The oldest is 19 and doesn't live with him, the other three are 16, 14 and 13. He has primary custody of the younger three. My niece, I'll call her Elle for the sake of the post, desperately wants to be accepted by her stepsiblings. But she goes about it in very counterproductive and manipulative ways. She has lied to Jer and my sister about them saying mean things, she has broken into their rooms and when they get annoyed with her, she tells her parents she had permission. She'll beg to go along whenever they're going out and has thrown some pretty major tantrums over them not wanting her to go. She's young and she's dealt with serious trauma. I think it could all be related. My sister's stepkids complain about Elle all the time and it annoys my sister and Jer. They think the kids are bullying her and being mean. The oldest doesn't go around because of the stuff he's heard about Elle. \n\nA couple of weeks ago we were at my parents house and Elle was telling me how the 16 year old had promised to take her to see a new movie she wanted. The 16 year old said they had not and told Elle she was a liar. Elle started to cry and told me the 16 year old was being mean and they had to keep their promise to her. My sister overheard and said she was tired of Elle being picked on. Other times Elle has told me they can't not spend time with her. That they're her siblings now and don't get to do sibling stuff without her. She also told me she doesn't want them going to their mom's again and wishes she would just go away.\n\nSo after the party at our parents, when nobody else was around, I spoke to my sister. She was telling me how her stepkids were such a disappointment and how angry it makes her that they're such a big problem and poor Elle, etc. I told her her stepkids are not the problem and that it's understandable they don't like when Elle lies. My sister claimed she doesn't. I told her Elle needs help. That it's not healthy to force yourself into situations and to make up things to get your way and I suggested that she needs help. I told her it can be hard to get along with someone who is willing to get you into trouble just to make you spend time with them. My sister accused me of not knowing what I was talking about and told me I was blaming Elle when she's the victim.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678183765, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kv9gc/aita_for_telling_my_sister_her_stepkids_arent_the/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your niece needs help. You mention that she was in therapy; is still attending? I think seeing a professional with experience with children and trauma would be a very good idea for this little girl. I understand that your sister doesn't want to think her daughter is at fault, but her child's behaviour will only alienate her from her stepsiblings and ignoring it is not helping anyone.", "NTA. It\u2019s not even appropriate for an eight-year-old to be where teenagers are hanging out unless it\u2019s specifically a kids activity, this is weird if she just trying to pawn off her mother and duties on the teenage kids? They aren\u2019t a free babysitter.  And I believe the kid was lying about the movies why would a 16-year-old promise to take an eight-year-old to the movies and then go back on that and then lie about it? Seems more likely to eight year old is the liar. Thank you for sticking up for the other kids when nobody else will.", "NTA - but your sister definitely is for refusing to see what\u2019s going on with Elle and not intervening. Dumping the kid in therapy is obviously not helping, and it\u2019s so wrong of her to further alienate the step children.", "NTA. Elle needs more help. It seems like she seeks love and attention. She doesnt mean no harm, it is her trauma.", "NTA.  Sounds like you recognize the issues Ellie has and understandably she would have issues.  I hope Ellie gets the help she needs.", "NTA -> \"That they're her siblings now and don't get to do sibling stuff without her. She also told me she doesn't want them going to their mom's again and wishes she would just go away.\"\n\nStraight away that just screams attachment/abandonment issues to me. I think you're spot on with the fact she needs help and before it escalates further. Lying is one thing, but if this is left unchecked and untreated, who knows how bad and how fast it will get before her mom sees the truth.", "NTA. You simply made a fair observation and you should be able to vocalise your concerns with your sister.", "Not at all", "NTA\n\nYour sister has to hear the truth even if it hurts. Her step kids need to be honest with her too. Elle needs some sort of professional help.", "NTA. You said what needed to be said.\n\nThat kid needs help and support. She's grown to the age of 8 as an only child and has suddenly gained 3 step brothers. She no doubt sees the rapport they have and desperately wishes to be a part of it and doesn't know how to attract the positive attention to make this happen.\n\nI'm not sure when Elle started therapy and how long it went for, but my guess is it shouldn't stop for many years yet. She's been through trauma and change that not many kids endure. \n\nThe boys also are old enough to start using positive reinforcement to help Elle go the right way about getting herself included. They can't do this alone though and need a lot of support as well. \n\nA difficult situation, but far from impossible. I wish you, your sister and all involved the best of luck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like you're spot on and your sister doesn't want to accept that her child has behavioral problems.", "NTA.   This is tough, as there's no good answer.  Do you think you could sue for custody?  I know it would be an unusual course of action.  But I fear the kids life is ruined if she stays with her enabling bio-mom.  She might be better off with uncle who is wise to her tricks.  Maybe you could mold her into a decent young lady.", "I think it has already alienated her from them. They seem like good kids so they don't go out of their way to say anything to her that would hurt or anything but I get the sense they want as little to do with her as possible and I can't blame them under the circumstances. She's not currently in therapy. The therapist she was seeing retired or left the field and my sister thought she was doing well and didn't seek out someone else.", "This was my thinking also. Besides that, given the turbulent relationship there already, why would the teenager sign themselves up for more obligation to Elle when the dislike is very clear? But my sister and her husband do not see it.", "Right she dumped the kid in therapy and now she\u2019s trying to dump the kid on the other kids.", "The OP mentioned in another comment she\u2019s not in therapy. Her old therapist moved on. Mom never found her a new one.   \n\n\nThe step kids are now therapy. /humor", "Absolutely not! \nThe description, with her backstory, screams separation anxiety to me. To take her away from her now family, especially the mother, would worsen everything for Elle. \nIf the sister doesn't come around soon, maybe take it up to Jer. \nHe should also know if this is new behaviour from his children or if they had been accused of bullying before (school, cousins, etc.).\nTheir dad might be more open to the concept of not everything beeing their fault - also if the idea of putting only Elle in therapy seems to daunting for them, I think family counselling would be a good shot here anyway.", "Losing a parent in front of you is not something she will be \u201cover\u201d in two years. She needs ongoing therapy and her mom needs to find a new one. That is troubling behavior for an 8 year-old and apparently mom is enabling it. NTA.", "Jer is not more open. He's just as hard on his own kids and only sees the worst in them over this. It's sad because the kids really only have him, their mom is a complicated matter, and I don't see this ending well for any of them if it continues.", ">Absolutely not! The description, with her backstory, screams separation anxiety to me. To take her away from her now family, especially the mother, would worsen everything for Elle. \n\nThat's a catch-22 situation, though.  Mom is part of the problem.  Staying with mom makes her worse.  Taking her away from mom makes her worse.  Damn...", "Oh dear, what a mess. \nAnd the family-therapy option? Do you think they'd be open to getting help for all of them? Because I think a therapist might be able to better understand Elles' behaviour and explain what's going on to them. Also, outsider opinions are often easier to digest than those of family/friends...", "I think my main concern would be they would not get a good therapist and that they would dismiss issues within the practice if things were going their way, or what was being said is what they want to hear. The only way I could see it maybe working is with my sister and Jer on their own or with Elle only and leave Jer's kids out for now. But even then, I'm not sure I will be listened to after this.", "NTA\n\nI foresee that Jer is about to lose primary custody due to the children's wishes, if he and your sister don't knock it off with forcing a manipulative 8-year-old on them.", "NTA. I would also point this out. Very few teenage boys want to constantly hang out with an 8 year old girl.", "NTA.  The step kids need to start recording Elle whenever they interact with her.  Then when Elle starts up with her lies the older kids can pull out the recording and play it for them.  Your sister can't say the older kids are bullying Elle and that Elle is telling the truth when the proof is in the recording that Elle is full of it and the older kids aren't bullying her.\n\nYou need to have that conversation with Elle again but record it this time.  Your sister will then be confronted with Elle's unrealistic expectations of her step siblings and how she doesn't want them to continue to go to their mother's house. \n\nAfter your sister hears all of the audio recordings then maybe she'll change her tune about Elle being the \"victim\" and realize she needs help.  Elle's becoming someone that no one will want to be around when she's older.", "NTA.  You are absolutely correct and giving your sister excellent advice, but I think you are tilting at windmills here.  Your sister isn\u2019t going to listen to you, she\u2019s made up her mind that Elle is the victim here because that\u2019s a much easier narrative than admitting Elle has become a monster, enforcing some boundaries and getting her some help.", "Many assholes here OP, You're one of them though.", "The mother won't be taking primary custody of them. Sadly they don't have that option so they'll be stuck with him and my sister.", "Wtf?! Sue for custody of the niece?! What alternate reality do you live in where this would be possible? And \u2018mold her into a decent young lady\u2019? I don\u2019t even what to know what you think that is. Niece needs therapy, not to be ripped away from her family. She\u2019s already experienced enough trauma.", "Maybe recommend that the teens record some of her behavior to show to the parents. Video/audio doesn't lie...", "The common denominator here is mom \u201cdumping\u201d her own daughter on others instead of engaging as a parent."]}
