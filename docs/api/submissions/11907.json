I mean, of course he should prioritize your daughter. You are a grown woman at the hospital surrounded by doctors and nurses. Your daughter is a four year old who is utterly dependent on her parents to meet her every day needs. But that is not the problem here. You have communication issues. Your needs aren't being met. It has nothing to do with your daughter, and you are both using her to deflect from the real issue.", "INFO: Why is there no support system with friends/family already in place since this is a recurring issue?", "NAH\n\nI'm not going to call you an AH because you are recovering from surgery in the hospital, and I understand that is a rough and scary thing.  You're looking for support, and you're not getting it.\n\nBut your husband isn't being an AH either.  He's suddenly solo-parenting 3 kids, and it's obviously overwhelming him.  He's struggling.  And sure, he could balance you vs the kids better, but he's doing the best he can (and honestly sounds like a pretty good job).  \n\nThe *needs* of your kids need to come first, and he does seem to get that seeing to your kids' needs is his primary focus right now.  The place where he is failing is that in trying to maintain routine for a likely scared 4 year old (commendable effort), he's insufficiently supporting you.  Yes, she can miss a couple storytimes because storytime at the library is not a need.  But you're also not being empathetic to how difficult this is for him and the kids to suddenly be down a parent, and you're acting like he just doesn't care.  It's not that you don't cross his mind because he's thoughtless, it's because there is too much on his mind right now to get through everything, and he *knows* you are safe and cared for right now, so you're less of a priority than the kids who are depending solely on him for everything.  \n\nInstead of looking solely to your husband for support, realize he's limited in the support he can provide due to caring for your kids alone and reach out to your wider support network.  Ask family/friends to talk/come visit you OR (better yet) to help with the kids so that your husband can have a break.  But your husband is not wrong for thinking caring for the kids comes before checking in with someone who is stable and recovering in the hospital.", "YTA it\u2019s a minor surgery and you are a self proclaimed frequent flyer. He\u2019s taking care of your kids while you can\u2019t and I\u2019m assuming still working himself. Just like he could of texted you you are a big girl you could of texted him too.", "Isn\u2019t husband working and taking care of kids?", "Very gentle YTA leaning a toward N/A/H\n\nI think this comes down to a lack of clear communication and your history as a frequent flyer. As the partner of a frequent flyer, we have to communicate pretty directly about is this a *drop everything and get here* moment or an *ER visits are something we know how to handle and let's not make it a big deal until it is a big deal* moment. \n\nYour hubs sounds stressed and like he was probably trying to keep things at home as normal as possible to keep the kiddos calm. He could have easily been thinking you've got this. I totally get wanting to have him with you in the hospital, but I didn't see you clearly communicating any needs in this situation. If you typically handle it well, he might not have realized what your needs were. \n\nI think you're stress came out on him and that's understandable, but it also sounds like you could have simply asked him earlier and more directly to be there and he would have.", "Sounds like he\u2019s busy taking care of the 3 young children, maintaining the household and presumably also working a full time job", "Gently YTA.

He not once remembered I was in the hospital? Not once did I cross his mind?\"\n\nGuess what? It's probably overwhelming and maybe he needs a minute or 30 to collect himself. \n\nCut him a break.

Having said that, I\u2019m sure it is hurtful he didn\u2019t message you however I would urge you to try and show some understanding on his side. He is trying to take care of all three kids and he is probably worried about you to. 30 mins in the car to take a breather is probably what he needs to take care of himself which is also pretty important. \n\nSounds like you two need to have a chat about communication expectations.", "YTA - He's taking care of all the kids on his own and still keeping up with their activities. \n\nYou  admit you get these issues regularly, and he has been doing a lot to help you and keep in contact.

Grow up and entertain yourself.", "YTA. Kids should always come first. Visiting you in the hospital is not the end all be all of the world.

You are in hospital being looked after and he is at home looking after 3 children,  give him a break.", "NAH\n\nI feel you, I really do.  I have been hospitalized a few times since having kids and my husband wasn\u2019t around much.   He was taking care of the kids and keeping things running on the home front. Sounds like what your husband is doing too?\n\nI wish he was there with me more but I knew he was parenting solo and probably overwhelmed. \n\nI hope your recovery goes well.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like a sour situation all around with no real villain to blame. While you shouldn\u2019t have yelled you were recovering from a surgery and while he definitely should\u2019ve at least texted he most likely was under stress. \n\nHowever, I noticed something strange: he needed to be an HOUR early for story time? He couldn\u2019t have dropped your things off then went there. I\u2019m assuming he might\u2019ve needed to sit for that 30 min to collect himself but he couldn\u2019t have shot you a quick text then sat for a while?\n\nAlso, I do have questions: Is there no contingency plan in place for this? Is there no one who can help? Have you two talked about any emotional and/or physical needs or expectations you both have while you\u2019re in the hospital/dealing with your \u2018medical flare-up\u2019s\u2019(not sure of the proper term).\n\nIt\u2019s bothering me that this is somewhat common occurrence and you\u2019ve even been in the hospital before yet he seems to have not even a basic idea where your emotional needs lie in these times or how to schedule around it.\n\nEdit: The more I think about this the more I suspect the verbal lashing might\u2019ve been op\u2019s long term grievances coming out; not just this one time.", "YTA.\n\nFucks sake you sound fucking exhausting. Guess what: when you have kids the kids take priority. \n\nI (dad) had a mini-stroke a few years back. Thankfully it turned out to be nothing serious but I made sure that, in my few days at the hospital, I wasn\u2019t freaking the kids out. They came and visited me once but I didn\u2019t want them there too much. My kids lives went on with school and extras and I didn\u2019t get upset.\n\nYou sound like you are so \u201cme me me\u201d that you\u2019d change your kids schedule to fit your issues.

I've had the exact surgeries as you have and have had kidney issues including an infection for nearly a decade. I've also been hospitalised with severe pancreatitis which is a pain worse than child birth (and proven). Your child is 4 years old, dependent on adults, and is probably scared and wondering where their mother is. Your child is too young emotionally to know any different and required her daddy to maintain routine and calm. You are a grown woman who has medical professionals around you, so you are not alone. Sure, your husband should've texted to check in on you, but you cannot resent a dependent child for needing her daddy. She's going to need you to be strong for her because when I was home with a stent in my kidney, I literally screamed in agony each time I urinated. Wishing you a speedy recovery but please stop overthinking and stressing because that's only going to delay your recovery.", "Gently, YTA. He is taking care of your three kids right now and probably trying to keep the youngest one's life uninterrupted so she doesn't worry about mommy being in a hospital.

I feel your frustration, but it sounds like he's doing all he can to keep up with things alone. Call back, apologise for yelling, explain how you feel and have a calm discussion about this.

An unfortunately common problem many marriages face is an over-prioritization of children over spouses, which is often used to mask deeper underlying issues. The core of your family unit is the relationship between husband and wife, and if it does not receive proper attention and maintenance, the family falls apart. I find the fact that he spent 30 minutes alone in the car somewhat curious. That he took that time for himself could be indicative of burnout given your ongoing health issues, and not necessarily indifference. Regardless, his lack of support during this most recent hospitalization is something that needs to be addressed.

No, you are not the center of his world and no, you aren't crossing his mind because that's full of the 'am I being a good parent to our three kids and am I running late and should I go to the grocery after picking up the boys at school' type thoughts.\n\nNo, after checking to make sure that you are not in ICU or imminent danger of dying, his priorities become the children and making sure that everything is going well at home so when you return there will not be additional work.\n\nAlso, if your kidneys act up at least once a month, I think you need to discuss this with a specialist or a doctor other than your primary.

You mentioned he was on his phone and didn't call you, that's probably because he needs a little alone time before going back to being a single dad of 3 for the week.

Yes kids need structure, but they also need to learn how to deal with the day-to-day having to change.", "THIS\n\nthe husband is using the children's schedule as an excuse for why he can't do anything, why he can't bring her stuff to the hospital, why he can't check in, why he can't talk to her\n\nbut those are excuses   \n\nhe drops the kid off at storytime and then sits in the car for half an hour not texting or talking. there isn't an actually scheduling conflict and husband is lying when he presents it that way\n\nif he can't need OPs for whatever reason - he's tired, burned out, can't handle illness, whatever - he should at the very least communicate that honestly, but he won't   \n\nlike say he was too tired to talk after getting all the kids to bed. he could at least text and let her know that he's too exhausted to message but is thinking of her and will check in again soon   \n\n/u/throwawaychildoverme\n\nhow much of the parenting and running of the household does your husband usually do? is this a massive step up for him or something he's used to?  \n\nhow has he previously handled you being ill? has he ever taken good care of you? has he changed?   \n\nmy thoughts are these:    \n\n1 - what you would do in this situation and what he would might be vastly different if he's not used to doing the amount of daily childcare and other stuff you are      \n\n2 - he might be very bad at handing illness and caregiving, or might be bad at doing it for you in particular   \n\n3 - if 2 is true, that's something he potentially overrode in the past when it was the first big emergency and he was scared. now if he's not scared the same way he doesn't see the same need   \n\neither way, I don't think there is a strict conflict here unless your husband is gonna insist that it's one of capacity. that he can take care of the children or you. if that is the case, yes, certain priorities may have to shift when you're hospitalised. but I think the issue isn't one of too much stuff, I think your husband is avoiding you (at least while you're in the hospital)\n\nand therapy night help on that front", "I agree. The way she worded it is not doing her any favors. \n\nIt sounds like they have different communication needs. For him, he\u2019s just preoccupied and overwhelmed with three kids and work. Besides external support, maybe OP could compromise (i.e., maybe have just a 5 minute phone call once a day checking in on her in the evening). Without further context, it just seems like she just wants to feel like she\u2019s being thought about, and it ended up with her lashing out over her daughter who happened to be collateral at the time.", "I am thankful that this is the top comment. There are a few times in your life that you are allowed to be whiny amd needy, and after surgery is definitely one of them \n\nBut certainly, your husband, who is doing his best, takes care of your kids is not the AH\n\nHope you get well soon.", "I guess I see story time as more of a want than a need LMAO", "But why has HE not arranged for someone else to look after their kids? Why would that be on her?", "This is not the time for Daddy to be coddled. This is the time for Daddy to step the fuck up and be the adult.\n\nIf he can make three kids, he can damn well parent them.", "100 This !!\u2b06\ufe0f", "It sounds like she tried to do that several times and he didn\u2019t listen.", "I am not usually a Dad doing the minimum apologist, but I feel like we need to accept that people handle stress differently, and so they provide the comfort they would want. \n\nHe wants and needs consistency. He expects (maybe correctly) that the kids need it, too. He is putting his effort where he thinks it\u2019s important. Which is no more right or wrong or selfish than what she wants, so I think OP gets YTA by default. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth. When my mom was diagnosed with cancer, we all, mom and dad included, verbally expressed how concerned we were that he would be a caretaker. He\u2019s not\u2026known for his comforting and supporting doting nature. Turns out the man is kind of great in an crisis - fairly unemotional and good at keeping feelings at bay, very unflappable, loves a schedule and a routine. This is all INCREDIBLY helpful when a person is in cancer treatment for 2 1/2 years. And people he was also obsessed with prioritizing his kids, he refused our help, maybe to his own detriment. Because kids, even adults, need to be protected. None of us thought he had it in him, and it turns out he was devoted to her, and the family they created. \n\nSo I guess what I\u2019m saying is, there is huge value (perhaps) to his method. Not better or worse. And OP herself states that he made the call she probably would have wanted. He shouldn\u2019t have to ask permission to do the thing he knows she wants OR what he thinks is best for their kid.", "Why is she the Ahole....if the wife can do solo parenting for long term, why can't husband do it for a few days with minimal stress?", "It's funny because he is not even putting the kids first. Just keeping up their routine and being a parent. Not sure what wife expects.", "sure, kids come first in a matter or life and death, but this is story time vs checking in on his hospitalized wife. how long does it take to send a text saying \"i'm thinking of you?\" presumably, he vowed to be with his wife in sickness and health, not to be at story time in sickness and health. if my spouse didn't even take the time to send me a few comforting words while i was alone and uncomfortable in the hospital, i'd be pretty pissed too. NAH.", "As unpopular as this comment may be I agree with you. I had this discussion with my wife early on. If one of us is down for the count the kids are what matters. We are adults we can regulate our own emotions and somewhat take care of ourselves. Once the initial crisis is over and we are in the hospital or things are well in hand the kids become all the priority. I was looking for just a comment like this. Too many adults expect their emotions managed by their spouse and its exhausting as all hell.", "He doesn't need to stop whole routines to at least text her tbf", "i don't think people have an understanding of \"kids come first.\" sure, kids might come first if both OP and the kids were hospitalized, but story time does not come above comforting a sick loved one. if you think asking for support while hospitalized is \"needy,\" i feel sorry for whatever poor person gets stuck with you.", "Dude is taking care of 3 kids and working. He also has to take care of himself at some point, even if 30 mins goofing around on his phone. ESPECIALLY if this happens a lot.", "I don\u2019t think this is fully fair though. They guy is having to work full time and take care of the kids. That\u2019s a lot and he is getting yelled at for sitting in the car for thirty minutes I cannot imagine how  a man would be treated if he made arguments about wife like that", "NTA and I suspect OP is going to end up in that statistic of women who get left be their husbands while going through a health crisis.", "the way ur so dramatic\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "the people around her will attend to her medical needs, but not her comfort, and trust me, being hospitalized is uncomfortable, especially with a stint in your pee hole. she can't get blankets or books or clothes from home or comforting words from the hospital staff. her husband has a responsibility to care for her in her time of need, too. yeah, it'll be hard on him, but it's hard on OP, too. no one said that having a family member be hospitalized was easy.", "Actually, kidney infections can be life threatening. They can either cause kidney failure or sepsis, both of which can be life threatening. I have had a kidney infection for 8 years and my boss found me collapsed over my keyboard in the office once. Went to hospital to be told that, had I delayed coming by about an hour, it would've been sepsis. I agree with everything else you've said as OP needs to chill and stop resenting the kids, but please don't belittle kidney infections.", "This. Big difference between need and want.", "Same reason that he isn't checking in as much as OP wants: because he is currently overwhelmed and doesn't have the mental space to think about a lot of things.  He's in survival mode, desperately trying to keep things together as much as possible for the kids.  Yes, it would be GREAT if he thought to himself \"I should reach out to other people and try to arrange childcare so that I can better support my wife in the hospital\", but he doesn't have space for that thought or to coordinate childcare.  He's completely overwhelmed trying to get through each day, tend to the kids' needs, and presumably work full time.  It's not like he's lazy.  This is meant to be a shared load, but currently he is shouldering nearly if not all of the burden.  \n\nOP, however, has the time and mental space, as evidenced by her ability to make a whole reddit post.  So since she is the one who has the time and mental space to spare, she should be the one trying to arrange childcare.  It's something she can do from where she is now, and it's a way she can contribute since currently 99% of the responsibilities are falling on her husband.", "Because he expected his wife to be an adult and realize that someone needs to parent the kids. She's not dying she's just dramatic.", "And he is.  OP isn't complaining about his parenting.  He's killing it there.  He's even getting the 4 year old to storytime.\n\nOP is complaining because OP wants to be coddled.  OP is mad because daddy is putting parenting before texting OP.\n\nSo maybe you mean \"If mommy can make 3 kids, she can be an adult and understand that parenting them comes before texting her to chat\"?", "Daddy is stepping the fucking up. It\u2019s Mommy being a needy asshole here.", "He's is he just isn't also parenting his wife while she acts like a baby.", "Prepare to get downvoted to oblivion by the AITA mob for daring to defy the hivemind.", "For real, I am finding this a bit weird. Mom is in the hospital, story time can be skipped. She should expect her husband to bring her her things. Seriously.", ">As unpopular as this comment may be I agree with you\n\nI hope it isn't because there's a lot of folks here that clearly don't have kids and, if they do, put themselves before their kids.", "Oh for sure. But to get that mad about it? It\u2019s an overreaction. When hubby is to busy to text me for long periods I literally just send \u201cdude tf?\u201d And then he says sorry when he can and we move on like grown up\u2019s", "If that's your thoughts on it then I pity the poor child that gets stuck with you!\n\nFFS OP is a grown human adult and the children are... guess what.. children!\n\nThey cannot look after themselves, whereas op is surrounded by professionals who get paid to look after them.", "Negative. You either don't have kids or you are failing to empathize with the situation. Wife is a frequent flyer this has likely happened often and therefore almost normal. Kids when you screw their routine can not regulate themselves very well. Especially the 4 year old. Wife is an adult and can easily regulate herself. She does not need him to regulate her emotions she is asking for compassion and understanding while giving him almost none. I have 2 kids and a 10 second text is beyond me most days if I have both of them by myself. My wife understands this. And so do I. Adults should easily be able to handle that with emotional fortitude. If not they weren't fit to be parents to begin with. \n\nFundamentally your inidivuality and needs ARE suspended when you have kids. Except in the briefest of moments.

Personally, I\u2019d put in much more effort to meet the needs of a hospitalized spouse going through surgery, but that\u2019s just me.

If she is yelling at him about not contacting her like this it\u2019s going to make him less likely to call.", "He was likely panicking when she was first admitted, and a lot of times in a situation like this you don't know enough to make future plans right away.  \n\nIf you put the *wants* of a hospitalized spouse who is stable and surrounded by nurses over the *needs* of your very young children who are likely terrified and depending on you entirely for their care and comfort, you would be TA.

Not even close. In the last year I've been in twice, once for surgery and once for an infection. You get an IV placed upon admission so they don't have to jab you every hour. That way when they need to take bloods etc they don't have to stick you every time. Also vitals are not every hour unless you are seriously not stable. Sure sleeping isn't the easiest but it also isn't the ordeal you are making it out to be. I managed my most recent stay with my only support being dropped off and picked up by my parents. No visits or even offers to stay while I was in emergency. Sorry but OP can put on her big girl panties and manage, especially as her husband is trying to parent 3 kids who are likely worried about their mum.", "Take it from experience... a stent in the kidney is very painful but in order to recover and prevent post-operative infection, the immune system needs OP to not get worked up about things. I was in an awful job a few years ago when I was told I needed bed rest for 4 weeks in order to recover from this same surgery. My managers stupidly gave too many people paid vacation leave at the same time and forced me back to work less than 2 weeks afterwards, forcing me to take a 1 hour bus ride each way. That caused me to have a post-operative infection and 7 years later it's still there. The point is- OP needs to chill in order to recover", "The reach out asking for things like a grown up, don\u2019t wait to get checked in on to tell of your dire need for a thing.

Nobody did anything AWFUL, but it\u2019s spilled milk being turned into an actual problem.", "Nice personal shot at the end there. And you clearly did read past that statement since you replied to the owed comment. \n\nYes sorry to say if you usually provide something for a child you do owe them to continue that if you are able. They clearly are able to. Bottom line whether you disagree with me or not about anything is that the wife should easily be able to handle her own emotions and empathize. If she can't she is nothing more than another child in that family needing managed. End of story. I expect more of adults than infantilizing them when they go through adversity. Overcoming adversity of any kind including being sick in a hospital (which btw I have experience with since I have a chronic heart condition that has almost killed me twice) is what makes us grow as humans. \n\nDisagree or not.

I can\u2019t help think about how much of the mental load falls on women and that\u2019s what he\u2019s experiencing. Sure I bet he was panicked.
