I mean, of course he should prioritize your daughter. You are a grown woman at the hospital surrounded by doctors and nurses. Your daughter is a four year old who is utterly dependent on her parents to meet her every day needs. But that is not the problem here. You have communication issues. Your needs aren't being met. It has nothing to do with your daughter, and you are both using her to deflect from the real issue.", "INFO: Why is there no support system with friends/family already in place since this is a recurring issue?", "NAH\n\nI'm not going to call you an AH because you are recovering from surgery in the hospital, and I understand that is a rough and scary thing.  You're looking for support, and you're not getting it.\n\nBut your husband isn't being an AH either.  He's suddenly solo-parenting 3 kids, and it's obviously overwhelming him.  He's struggling.  And sure, he could balance you vs the kids better, but he's doing the best he can (and honestly sounds like a pretty good job).  \n\nThe *needs* of your kids need to come first, and he does seem to get that seeing to your kids' needs is his primary focus right now.  The place where he is failing is that in trying to maintain routine for a likely scared 4 year old (commendable effort), he's insufficiently supporting you.  Yes, she can miss a couple storytimes because storytime at the library is not a need.  But you're also not being empathetic to how difficult this is for him and the kids to suddenly be down a parent, and you're acting like he just doesn't care.  It's not that you don't cross his mind because he's thoughtless, it's because there is too much on his mind right now to get through everything, and he *knows* you are safe and cared for right now, so you're less of a priority than the kids who are depending solely on him for everything.  \n\nInstead of looking solely to your husband for support, realize he's limited in the support he can provide due to caring for your kids alone and reach out to your wider support network.  Ask family/friends to talk/come visit you OR (better yet) to help with the kids so that your husband can have a break.  But your husband is not wrong for thinking caring for the kids comes before checking in with someone who is stable and recovering in the hospital.", "YTA it\u2019s a minor surgery and you are a self proclaimed frequent flyer. He\u2019s taking care of your kids while you can\u2019t and I\u2019m assuming still working himself. Just like he could of texted you you are a big girl you could of texted him too.", "Isn\u2019t husband working and taking care of kids?", "Very gentle YTA leaning a toward N/A/H\n\nI think this comes down to a lack of clear communication and your history as a frequent flyer. As the partner of a frequent flyer, we have to communicate pretty directly about is this a *drop everything and get here* moment or an *ER visits are something we know how to handle and let's not make it a big deal until it is a big deal* moment. \n\nYour hubs sounds stressed and like he was probably trying to keep things at home as normal as possible to keep the kiddos calm. He could have easily been thinking you've got this. I totally get wanting to have him with you in the hospital, but I didn't see you clearly communicating any needs in this situation. If you typically handle it well, he might not have realized what your needs were. \n\nI think you're stress came out on him and that's understandable, but it also sounds like you could have simply asked him earlier and more directly to be there and he would have.", "Sounds like he\u2019s busy taking care of the 3 young children, maintaining the household and presumably also working a full time job", "Gently YTA.

He not once remembered I was in the hospital? Not once did I cross his mind?\"\n\nGuess what? It's probably overwhelming and maybe he needs a minute or 30 to collect himself. \n\nCut him a break.

Having said that, I\u2019m sure it is hurtful he didn\u2019t message you however I would urge you to try and show some understanding on his side. He is trying to take care of all three kids and he is probably worried about you to. 30 mins in the car to take a breather is probably what he needs to take care of himself which is also pretty important. \n\nSounds like you two need to have a chat about communication expectations.", "YTA - He's taking care of all the kids on his own and still keeping up with their activities. \n\nYou  admit you get these issues regularly, and he has been doing a lot to help you and keep in contact.

Grow up and entertain yourself.", "YTA. Kids should always come first. Visiting you in the hospital is not the end all be all of the world.

You are in hospital being looked after and he is at home looking after 3 children,  give him a break.", "NAH\n\nI feel you, I really do.  I have been hospitalized a few times since having kids and my husband wasn\u2019t around much.   He was taking care of the kids and keeping things running on the home front. Sounds like what your husband is doing too?\n\nI wish he was there with me more but I knew he was parenting solo and probably overwhelmed. \n\nI hope your recovery goes well.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like a sour situation all around with no real villain to blame. While you shouldn\u2019t have yelled you were recovering from a surgery and while he definitely should\u2019ve at least texted he most likely was under stress. \n\nHowever, I noticed something strange: he needed to be an HOUR early for story time? He couldn\u2019t have dropped your things off then went there. I\u2019m assuming he might\u2019ve needed to sit for that 30 min to collect himself but he couldn\u2019t have shot you a quick text then sat for a while?\n\nAlso, I do have questions: Is there no contingency plan in place for this? Is there no one who can help? Have you two talked about any emotional and/or physical needs or expectations you both have while you\u2019re in the hospital/dealing with your \u2018medical flare-up\u2019s\u2019(not sure of the proper term).\n\nIt\u2019s bothering me that this is somewhat common occurrence and you\u2019ve even been in the hospital before yet he seems to have not even a basic idea where your emotional needs lie in these times or how to schedule around it.\n\nEdit: The more I think about this the more I suspect the verbal lashing might\u2019ve been op\u2019s long term grievances coming out; not just this one time.", "YTA.\n\nFucks sake you sound fucking exhausting. Guess what: when you have kids the kids take priority. \n\nI (dad) had a mini-stroke a few years back. Thankfully it turned out to be nothing serious but I made sure that, in my few days at the hospital, I wasn\u2019t freaking the kids out. They came and visited me once but I didn\u2019t want them there too much. My kids lives went on with school and extras and I didn\u2019t get upset.\n\nYou sound like you are so \u201cme me me\u201d that you\u2019d change your kids schedule to fit your issues.

I've had the exact surgeries as you have and have had kidney issues including an infection for nearly a decade. I've also been hospitalised with severe pancreatitis which is a pain worse than child birth (and proven). Your child is 4 years old, dependent on adults, and is probably scared and wondering where their mother is. Your child is too young emotionally to know any different and required her daddy to maintain routine and calm. You are a grown woman who has medical professionals around you, so you are not alone. Sure, your husband should've texted to check in on you, but you cannot resent a dependent child for needing her daddy. She's going to need you to be strong for her because when I was home with a stent in my kidney, I literally screamed in agony each time I urinated. Wishing you a speedy recovery but please stop overthinking and stressing because that's only going to delay your recovery.", "Gently, YTA. He is taking care of your three kids right now and probably trying to keep the youngest one's life uninterrupted so she doesn't worry about mommy being in a hospital.

I feel your frustration, but it sounds like he's doing all he can to keep up with things alone. Call back, apologise for yelling, explain how you feel and have a calm discussion about this.

An unfortunately common problem many marriages face is an over-prioritization of children over spouses, which is often used to mask deeper underlying issues. The core of your family unit is the relationship between husband and wife, and if it does not receive proper attention and maintenance, the family falls apart. I find the fact that he spent 30 minutes alone in the car somewhat curious. That he took that time for himself could be indicative of burnout given your ongoing health issues, and not necessarily indifference. Regardless, his lack of support during this most recent hospitalization is something that needs to be addressed.

No, you are not the center of his world and no, you aren't crossing his mind because that's full of the 'am I being a good parent to our three kids and am I running late and should I go to the grocery after picking up the boys at school' type thoughts.\n\nNo, after checking to make sure that you are not in ICU or imminent danger of dying, his priorities become the children and making sure that everything is going well at home so when you return there will not be additional work.\n\nAlso, if your kidneys act up at least once a month, I think you need to discuss this with a specialist or a doctor other than your primary.

You mentioned he was on his phone and didn't call you, that's probably because he needs a little alone time before going back to being a single dad of 3 for the week.

This is all INCREDIBLY helpful when a person is in cancer treatment for 2 1/2 years. And people he was also obsessed with prioritizing his kids, he refused our help, maybe to his own detriment.

Whilst you are in hospital in pain and discomfort, all you have to do all day is think about how he hasn\u2019t contacted you and it interferes with your self worth. You are in a vulnerable place.

I completely understand being in the hospital and having no one contact you or come up to see you as I\u2019ve been in this position way too many times to count and my family doesn\u2019t have the excuse of small children. Heck I had a surgery in 2017 that could have killed me but I needed it and my family only visited once during my stay. A year before that surgery I had a surgery and was in the hospital for almost 20 days, and was only visited twice during the entire stay. So I get it! Here\u2019s the thing though you have small children who are probably scared about you being in the hospital and a husband who\u2019s doing his best. If I had kids they would always come first and I wouldn\u2019t want them to see me in the hospital, I wouldn\u2019t even let my sister bring her kids to see me while in the hospital because it can be scary seeing me hooked up to everything and in so much pain. My sister feels the same way and every time she\u2019s had to be in the hospital she will only FaceTime them as they come first. It\u2019s bad enough that they saw how bad she was after her back surgery. NAH, you have every right to feel the way you do but so does your husband. It also doesn\u2019t help that the meds they give make a person more emotional so things you\u2019d usually be calm about are something that get a person over emotional. I remember crying and being so upset for days after my knee surgery. I suggest once your better that you and the hubby sit down and come up with a game plan should this happen again, maybe have phone tree set up of people you trust that can help with the kids while you are in the hospital.

And I say that as a mom of 2 who has been in that exact position being in the hospital with kidney stones and each time they have been a big ordeal because they got stuck and took multiple surgeries. The first time our youngest wasn\u2019t in school yet and we have no family to help out or anyone for that matter. It\u2019s just us. He brought me everything I asked for from home when he could and took care of all our pets and our kids and everything else that came up. Some days all he could do was walk in the room set my stuff down and leave. Was I upset about it? Yeah sure, because I was in excruciating pain (so much so I was on 4 pain medications round the clock, 3 being narcs) and I was lonely and I cried more than once. Difference is that I knew I was emotional because of the situation and the pain and I didn\u2019t take it out on him or act like a diva and tell him I was more important than anything. He did his best, which was amazing, and even brought the kids to see me after dinner just so I got hugs and kisses goodnight. He was frequently busy during the day and we didn\u2019t talk all that much.. but he was doing what he needed to do and he knew I was being taken care of. You are being taken care of in a hospital. You have everything you NEED, there\u2019s things you maybe WANT him to bring but your NEEDS are being met by the hospital. You should be over the moon he is keeping their schedule and doing story time! So many women don\u2019t have a husband that would even do the bare minimum! Yeah he could and should have called/texted but you as a mom should know how exhausting dealing 3 kids at once is.. poor dad probably fell asleep immediately after he put the kids in bed.

Asking for a message/call from your partner after you have been in extreme pain and had surgery is NOT NEEDY.

I know we get a lot of incompetent part-time dads on AITA but my reading is that he\u2019s fully aware of the kids\u2019 schedule/needs but it\u2019s typically divided more manageably between them.

The husband did visits her before and after surgery along w their kids. I guess the husband is probably tired n tryin to catch some sleep while taking care of their kids?

So OP wanting a bit of attention was not assholery", "There\u2019s nothing to say he didn\u2019t bring the things.

I have had quite a few patients die of this complication due to not being fit for surgery, as they become rapidly septic and antibiotics alone are seldom effective. Simple stones can pass by themselves if they are small, but may require procedures if larger. If her previous stones were not infected, she may be much sicker this time - it's good that she was able to be treated promptly.", "That kid did not NEED to go storytime", "It's possible too", "She did. A few times.", "Perhaps, but if the roles were reversed and he was the one in the hospital, I would also say she wasn't wrong to prioritize caring for the kids, and I daresay that would likely be the majority opinion here as well. \n\nHe's not forgetting to be a partner, he just has more pressing immediate concerns at the minute. (and in fact picking up the parental load is *part* of being a partner).", "Totally agree. I do feel like OP is being a bit demanding, but I also don\u2019t agree that the husband is doing his best, and she should be super patient.", "I take my health perfectly seriously thanks. Not all of us get blessed with healthy bodies. Neither stay was related to the other though both were only a couple months apart. And given that my own body is hell  bent on attacking itself, any infection can land me in hospital, that's just a side effect of stopping my body destroying itself, so I'm well aware of how serious an infection can be.\n\nIf OP was in critical condition I would understand but she is clearly NOT. When I was in hospital for an infection I could barely keep my eyes open let alone find the energy to complain to strangers on the internet. And it's not even like the husband didn't visit her, he did! He just missed one phone call and then didn't stop his kids routines to show up at the hospital exactly when OP wanted or didnt call at an exact time? Im not quite sure anymore. And not changing the kids routines is probably one of the best things he could be doing. Yes in a perfect world everyone would be able to be by their loved ones side 24/7 while they are in hospital but that's just not reality and if OP has been to the hospital as often as they say then surely by now they should understand people can't just drop everything and be there with you and honestly its kind of selfish to expect that.\n\nBTW a kidney stent is to help pass the stone by widening the ureters allowing the stone to pass from the kidney to the bladder. Has nothing to do with dealing with swelling (except in the case where swelling is narrowing the ureters) or blood loss as you state and isn't even going to do anything for the infection except clear the stone. I do actually have some degree of medical knowledge and a degree in microbiology.", "You do understand it's your experience that wasn't normal right? You were clearly on a very specific antibiotic. And most people don't lose their IV access. \n\nWow you really have it out for this guy. No it's not ideal to not have support while you are sick in hospital but this guy is likely doing his best to continue holding down his job while caring for 3 kids who have definitely picked up on the fact their mother isn't well and depending in their age could well be expressing their worry at the situation by being a more difficult than normal. This man is doing the absolute right thing by keeping their routines as normal as possible. And yeah, he missed calling one time but nobody is perfect. \n\nOP is clearly not in critical condition if she's well enough to be posting shit on social media. Her expectations that everyone will just drop everything and be there are honestly astounding. Especially as it sounds like kidney problems are not some new thing to her. Sorry but the only person who needs to \"get real\" here is you. Life is far from perfect or fair and while being in hospital on your own kind of sucks, it's not the end of the world and it's not like her husband is just doing it to be malicious or anything.
