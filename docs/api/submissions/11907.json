I mean, of course he should prioritize your daughter. You are a grown woman at the hospital surrounded by doctors and nurses. Your daughter is a four year old who is utterly dependent on her parents to meet her every day needs. But that is not the problem here. You have communication issues. Your needs aren't being met. It has nothing to do with your daughter, and you are both using her to deflect from the real issue.", "INFO: Why is there no support system with friends/family already in place since this is a recurring issue?", "NAH\n\nI'm not going to call you an AH because you are recovering from surgery in the hospital, and I understand that is a rough and scary thing.  You're looking for support, and you're not getting it.\n\nBut your husband isn't being an AH either.  He's suddenly solo-parenting 3 kids, and it's obviously overwhelming him.  He's struggling.  And sure, he could balance you vs the kids better, but he's doing the best he can (and honestly sounds like a pretty good job).  \n\nThe *needs* of your kids need to come first, and he does seem to get that seeing to your kids' needs is his primary focus right now.  The place where he is failing is that in trying to maintain routine for a likely scared 4 year old (commendable effort), he's insufficiently supporting you.  Yes, she can miss a couple storytimes because storytime at the library is not a need.  But you're also not being empathetic to how difficult this is for him and the kids to suddenly be down a parent, and you're acting like he just doesn't care.  It's not that you don't cross his mind because he's thoughtless, it's because there is too much on his mind right now to get through everything, and he *knows* you are safe and cared for right now, so you're less of a priority than the kids who are depending solely on him for everything.  \n\nInstead of looking solely to your husband for support, realize he's limited in the support he can provide due to caring for your kids alone and reach out to your wider support network.  Ask family/friends to talk/come visit you OR (better yet) to help with the kids so that your husband can have a break.  But your husband is not wrong for thinking caring for the kids comes before checking in with someone who is stable and recovering in the hospital.", "YTA it\u2019s a minor surgery and you are a self proclaimed frequent flyer. He\u2019s taking care of your kids while you can\u2019t and I\u2019m assuming still working himself. Just like he could of texted you you are a big girl you could of texted him too.", "Isn\u2019t husband working and taking care of kids?", "Very gentle YTA leaning a toward N/A/H\n\nI think this comes down to a lack of clear communication and your history as a frequent flyer. As the partner of a frequent flyer, we have to communicate pretty directly about is this a *drop everything and get here* moment or an *ER visits are something we know how to handle and let's not make it a big deal until it is a big deal* moment. \n\nYour hubs sounds stressed and like he was probably trying to keep things at home as normal as possible to keep the kiddos calm. He could have easily been thinking you've got this. I totally get wanting to have him with you in the hospital, but I didn't see you clearly communicating any needs in this situation. If you typically handle it well, he might not have realized what your needs were. \n\nI think you're stress came out on him and that's understandable, but it also sounds like you could have simply asked him earlier and more directly to be there and he would have.", "Sounds like he\u2019s busy taking care of the 3 young children, maintaining the household and presumably also working a full time job", "Gently YTA.

He not once remembered I was in the hospital? Not once did I cross his mind?\"\n\nGuess what? It's probably overwhelming and maybe he needs a minute or 30 to collect himself. \n\nCut him a break.

Having said that, I\u2019m sure it is hurtful he didn\u2019t message you however I would urge you to try and show some understanding on his side. He is trying to take care of all three kids and he is probably worried about you to. 30 mins in the car to take a breather is probably what he needs to take care of himself which is also pretty important. \n\nSounds like you two need to have a chat about communication expectations.", "YTA - He's taking care of all the kids on his own and still keeping up with their activities. \n\nYou  admit you get these issues regularly, and he has been doing a lot to help you and keep in contact.

Grow up and entertain yourself.", "YTA. Kids should always come first. Visiting you in the hospital is not the end all be all of the world.

You are in hospital being looked after and he is at home looking after 3 children,  give him a break.", "NAH\n\nI feel you, I really do.  I have been hospitalized a few times since having kids and my husband wasn\u2019t around much.   He was taking care of the kids and keeping things running on the home front. Sounds like what your husband is doing too?\n\nI wish he was there with me more but I knew he was parenting solo and probably overwhelmed. \n\nI hope your recovery goes well.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like a sour situation all around with no real villain to blame. While you shouldn\u2019t have yelled you were recovering from a surgery and while he definitely should\u2019ve at least texted he most likely was under stress. \n\nHowever, I noticed something strange: he needed to be an HOUR early for story time? He couldn\u2019t have dropped your things off then went there. I\u2019m assuming he might\u2019ve needed to sit for that 30 min to collect himself but he couldn\u2019t have shot you a quick text then sat for a while?\n\nAlso, I do have questions: Is there no contingency plan in place for this? Is there no one who can help? Have you two talked about any emotional and/or physical needs or expectations you both have while you\u2019re in the hospital/dealing with your \u2018medical flare-up\u2019s\u2019(not sure of the proper term).\n\nIt\u2019s bothering me that this is somewhat common occurrence and you\u2019ve even been in the hospital before yet he seems to have not even a basic idea where your emotional needs lie in these times or how to schedule around it.\n\nEdit: The more I think about this the more I suspect the verbal lashing might\u2019ve been op\u2019s long term grievances coming out; not just this one time.", "YTA.\n\nFucks sake you sound fucking exhausting. Guess what: when you have kids the kids take priority. \n\nI (dad) had a mini-stroke a few years back. Thankfully it turned out to be nothing serious but I made sure that, in my few days at the hospital, I wasn\u2019t freaking the kids out. They came and visited me once but I didn\u2019t want them there too much. My kids lives went on with school and extras and I didn\u2019t get upset.\n\nYou sound like you are so \u201cme me me\u201d that you\u2019d change your kids schedule to fit your issues.

I've had the exact surgeries as you have and have had kidney issues including an infection for nearly a decade. I've also been hospitalised with severe pancreatitis which is a pain worse than child birth (and proven). Your child is 4 years old, dependent on adults, and is probably scared and wondering where their mother is. Your child is too young emotionally to know any different and required her daddy to maintain routine and calm. You are a grown woman who has medical professionals around you, so you are not alone. Sure, your husband should've texted to check in on you, but you cannot resent a dependent child for needing her daddy. She's going to need you to be strong for her because when I was home with a stent in my kidney, I literally screamed in agony each time I urinated. Wishing you a speedy recovery but please stop overthinking and stressing because that's only going to delay your recovery.", "Gently, YTA. He is taking care of your three kids right now and probably trying to keep the youngest one's life uninterrupted so she doesn't worry about mommy being in a hospital.

I feel your frustration, but it sounds like he's doing all he can to keep up with things alone. Call back, apologise for yelling, explain how you feel and have a calm discussion about this. Let him talk openly too, try not to judge each other and use this as a learning opportunity for a (fingers crossed it doesn't happen again, but still) next time.", "You\u2019re mad the whole world didn\u2019t stop spinning for you?

An unfortunately common problem many marriages face is an over-prioritization of children over spouses, which is often used to mask deeper underlying issues. The core of your family unit is the relationship between husband and wife, and if it does not receive proper attention and maintenance, the family falls apart. I find the fact that he spent 30 minutes alone in the car somewhat curious. That he took that time for himself could be indicative of burnout given your ongoing health issues, and not necessarily indifference. Regardless, his lack of support during this most recent hospitalization is something that needs to be addressed.

No, you are not the center of his world and no, you aren't crossing his mind because that's full of the 'am I being a good parent to our three kids and am I running late and should I go to the grocery after picking up the boys at school' type thoughts.\n\nNo, after checking to make sure that you are not in ICU or imminent danger of dying, his priorities become the children and making sure that everything is going well at home so when you return there will not be additional work.\n\nAlso, if your kidneys act up at least once a month, I think you need to discuss this with a specialist or a doctor other than your primary.

You mentioned he was on his phone and didn't call you, that's probably because he needs a little alone time before going back to being a single dad of 3 for the week.

This is all INCREDIBLY helpful when a person is in cancer treatment for 2 1/2 years. And people he was also obsessed with prioritizing his kids, he refused our help, maybe to his own detriment.

BUT but if you think dropping your child off at story time and sitting on your phone outweighs visiting your wife at the hospital to give her her things while she is recovering from surgery *(Or just texting her to see if she's all right)* then that isn't \"prioritizing your kids,\" that is neglecting your spouse's needs.", "All of this.

Or calling to make sure I was okay and had what I needed.\nMy husband had a bad stomache bug this last year. We all went to the ER. Because he couldn't drive himself. We were all there for 6hrs waiting. Yes it was hard but my kids understood. My hubby doesn't do well when he's sick. Us just being there for him meant the world. Why are so many people acting like 3 kids are so hard to deal with. They're his kids.  A simple call here and there isn't hard. It seems more like the husband doesn't want to deal with his wife being sick. Using the kids as an excuse is crappy behavior from a partner.", "Right?!

Many people don\u2019t.", "Yeah, actually it does. \n\nKids are impacted by their mum being in hospital. It's a big deal for them. Kids are sooo routine focussed. It's very very important that their routine is as uninterrupted as possible, so they feel reassured that what's happening is ok and manageable and everything will go back to normal. Imagine if you're really small the difference between something happening and everyone tells you mum will be fine, and then they go on as normal with the routine, vs everything about your life changes because of it. For a kid that would be so much more unsettling. \n\nI know it sounds crazy, but storytime is super important from the 4yr old perspective.
