He has a whole new lease on life and has found that almost losing you has made him appreciate you even more now, and he wants to show you that. He also may still be scared to lose you as well. \n\nIf the answer is no, then maybe he just sees that you are more important to him than he even saw before, and he is trying to show you that. \n\nYou are not the A-hole for being sarcastic.  You are the A-hole for complaining that he is showing you love and support after you were injured and hurting.", "NAH, I feel like this is just a case of miscommunication, your not an asshole for making a sarcastic joke and he\u2019s not an asshole for misunderstanding. I\u2019m sure your husband is only being more affectionate and clingy because it scared him to almost lose you. Maybe some counselling to help you both process the trauma will be of help.", "NAH\n\nYour husband is clearly terrified he could have lost you. While you think the sarcasm was obvious, he is in such a different headspace it didn't register. You two just need to communicate better. I am sure this was traumatizing for both of you and is affecting you differently. \n\nSpeedy recovery!", "Yea!! Both of you were in a serious car accident accident and he was terrified of losing you!! you should not have use sarcasm to communicate with him. You should have been open and honest and communicated with the understanding that this was a big fucking deal!!", "I'm going to go against the grain here and say YTA. The reason why is that you were injured severely enough for the hospital to tell you to get a medical bed. Spinal injuries are something I am familiar with due to my job  (plaintiffs' personal injury paralegal), and I can tell you that I have NEVER seen a medical bed recommended for a basic vertebral disc injury. \n\nYour husband was likely scared shirtless by the severity of the wreck and your injuries. He wants the reassurance that you are going to be okay, and he is expressing that through physical touch. You come across as dismissive of his fear, and that's why I'm stating YTA. Be kind, understanding, and reassuring. Both of you may need therapy following recovery from your injuries to work through his fears.", "NAH \nAnd I know you are probably fed up with how clingy he is being. Especially if it is not normally his style. But can I just say that to me.. I find it so cute. He really loves you and he is afraid of losing you. I think he wants to just make sure he knows that you are RIGHT there. Where he can protect you. \nIt will fade after a while. (The clinging) But I believe this is his coping mechanism.", "NTA for getting upset that he couldn't pick up on sarcasm, but YTA for ranting about how he is being affectionate.", "INFO: Have you actually talked to him about needing space?", "NTA but I would probably apologize and blame it on not feeling well.", "NAH - trauma manifests differently in different people. He, now - needs u. To feel you, be around u - consciously/subconsciously reminds him that ur alive. U - need space, which is also ok. Both of u need to communicate better.", "NTA. I can understand why you\u2019re a bit exasperated since this behavior is new, but he clearly had a big scare and is concerned for you. I think Mel is slightly the AH because even if you genuinely offered to let him sleep with you in the medical bed, he should use some common sense and realize that\u2019s not good for your injuries at the moment.", "Slightly the AH. Guys don\u2019t get sarcasm, he\u2019s not a mind reader. His becoming clingy is most likely due to him realizing that he almost lost you. Cut him some slack and straight out express your need clearly so there\u2019s no misunderstanding and try to remember that you could have loss him too. Count your blessings and communicate clearly. I hope you make a full recovery!", "NTA.  It's not your fault he cannot pick up sarcasm.  Personally speaking, sarcasm is my language, so I don't see how it would be difficult to pick up.\n\nAs for his being clingy, was he driving when you had the accident?  if so, that's why he's being that way.  He's possibly feeling a bit guilty.", "Im kinda feeling if it were me, I would put some of this excess touching to good use.... if you know what I mean..", "So he got his little feelings hurt, you\u2019re in more physical pain than his stupid feelings over climbing into bed with you. It\u2019s a twin bed for crying out loud. Did he really think that would be good for you the person with the bad spine and broken leg? I suspect he did a 180 because he was scared to death of losing you. Now he\u2019s overcompensating. Just ask him to tone it down. And no more climbing into bed. I hope you feel better soon.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

If you meant it as sarcasm then why did you allow him to fall asleep next to you? Why are you questioning the fact that your husband loves you and wants to be near you after almost losing you?\n\nYou have a husband who deeply cares for you and maybe you need to readjust your outlook on the situation.", "Maybe he feels guilty about the accident? Who was driving? If it was him I imagine that\u2019s why he\u2019s so clingy", "YTA. (Mildly) He probably is scared out of his mind from nearly losing you.", "I did not almost die. I was injured yeah but not fatally.", "Yeah I told him I needed a bit of space and he says okay but goes straight back to holding my hand or foot or kissing my head. It\u2019s weird.

His not respecting your boundaries is not helpful or healthy for you long-term.", "He\u2019s afraid of what could have been. Gently ask him to stop touching your leg. He is having a hard time too.
