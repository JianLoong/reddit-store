He has a whole new lease on life and has found that almost losing you has made him appreciate you even more now, and he wants to show you that. He also may still be scared to lose you as well. \n\nIf the answer is no, then maybe he just sees that you are more important to him than he even saw before, and he is trying to show you that. \n\nYou are not the A-hole for being sarcastic.  You are the A-hole for complaining that he is showing you love and support after you were injured and hurting.", "NAH, I feel like this is just a case of miscommunication, your not an asshole for making a sarcastic joke and he\u2019s not an asshole for misunderstanding. I\u2019m sure your husband is only being more affectionate and clingy because it scared him to almost lose you. Maybe some counselling to help you both process the trauma will be of help.", "NAH\n\nYour husband is clearly terrified he could have lost you. While you think the sarcasm was obvious, he is in such a different headspace it didn't register. You two just need to communicate better. I am sure this was traumatizing for both of you and is affecting you differently. \n\nSpeedy recovery!", "Yea!! Both of you were in a serious car accident accident and he was terrified of losing you!! you should not have use sarcasm to communicate with him. You should have been open and honest and communicated with the understanding that this was a big fucking deal!!", "I'm going to go against the grain here and say YTA. The reason why is that you were injured severely enough for the hospital to tell you to get a medical bed. Spinal injuries are something I am familiar with due to my job  (plaintiffs' personal injury paralegal), and I can tell you that I have NEVER seen a medical bed recommended for a basic vertebral disc injury. \n\nYour husband was likely scared shirtless by the severity of the wreck and your injuries. He wants the reassurance that you are going to be okay, and he is expressing that through physical touch. You come across as dismissive of his fear, and that's why I'm stating YTA. Be kind, understanding, and reassuring. Both of you may need therapy following recovery from your injuries to work through his fears.", "NAH \nAnd I know you are probably fed up with how clingy he is being. Especially if it is not normally his style. But can I just say that to me.. I find it so cute. He really loves you and he is afraid of losing you. I think he wants to just make sure he knows that you are RIGHT there. Where he can protect you. \nIt will fade after a while. (The clinging) But I believe this is his coping mechanism.", "NTA for getting upset that he couldn't pick up on sarcasm, but YTA for ranting about how he is being affectionate.", "INFO: Have you actually talked to him about needing space?", "NTA but I would probably apologize and blame it on not feeling well.", "NAH - trauma manifests differently in different people. He, now - needs u. To feel you, be around u - consciously/subconsciously reminds him that ur alive. U - need space, which is also ok. Both of u need to communicate better.", "NTA. I can understand why you\u2019re a bit exasperated since this behavior is new, but he clearly had a big scare and is concerned for you. I think Mel is slightly the AH because even if you genuinely offered to let him sleep with you in the medical bed, he should use some common sense and realize that\u2019s not good for your injuries at the moment.", "Slightly the AH. Guys don\u2019t get sarcasm, he\u2019s not a mind reader. His becoming clingy is most likely due to him realizing that he almost lost you. Cut him some slack and straight out express your need clearly so there\u2019s no misunderstanding and try to remember that you could have loss him too. Count your blessings and communicate clearly. I hope you make a full recovery!", "NTA.  It's not your fault he cannot pick up sarcasm.  Personally speaking, sarcasm is my language, so I don't see how it would be difficult to pick up.\n\nAs for his being clingy, was he driving when you had the accident?  if so, that's why he's being that way.  He's possibly feeling a bit guilty.", "Im kinda feeling if it were me, I would put some of this excess touching to good use.... if you know what I mean..", "So he got his little feelings hurt, you\u2019re in more physical pain than his stupid feelings over climbing into bed with you. It\u2019s a twin bed for crying out loud. Did he really think that would be good for you the person with the bad spine and broken leg? I suspect he did a 180 because he was scared to death of losing you. Now he\u2019s overcompensating. Just ask him to tone it down. And no more climbing into bed.

Who was driving? If it was him I imagine that\u2019s why he\u2019s so clingy", "YTA. (Mildly) He probably is scared out of his mind from nearly losing you.", "I did not almost die. I was injured yeah but not fatally.", "Yeah I told him I needed a bit of space and he says okay but goes straight back to holding my hand or foot or kissing my head. It\u2019s weird.

Good luck", "Still a very serious injury. A spinal injury is nothing to sneeze at, and your husband may not share your nonchalance", "What everyone else said but also it\u2019s okay, you\u2019re allowed to be frustrated by the new clingy. It can be incredibly overwhelming especially to people not used to it or who aren\u2019t fond of physical affection. \n\nYou can tell your husband this. Gently just let him know you appreciate his concern and affection but you\u2019re still healing and in lots of physical pain and it\u2019s exhausting. Which means sometimes you just need some time for yourself to just rest. \n\nTouch is exhausting! It\u2019s okay to feel that way. When my premi twins were in nicu we were very limited as to how much we could hold them, touch them interact with them because it was physically exhausting for them and they needed to expend as little energy as possible.", "YTA.\nYour lack of communication skills is not your husband's fault.\n\nIf you really meant it, why did you let him stay in bed when he climbed in, and then stay the whole night.\n\nHave you ever thought that your husband might be suffering from a bit of PTSD himself?", "I\u2019m really sorry you went through this. \n\nI think your husband is frightened that he could\u2019ve lost you.

Obviously you\u2019ve both been through a traumatic experience, he\u2019s seen you in pretty serious condition in the hospital, probably feels really lucky that you got through it, and is being more demonstrative because he\u2019s recognized that you\u2019re precious. \n\nI realize the 180 can probably be a little off putting, but you need to communicate that to your husband instead of trying to play it off as sarcasm. Be adult and tell him directly (as kindly as you can) what you\u2019d like from him at this time.\n\nSoft YTA, for trying to deflect with sarcasm instead of having an adult conversation about navigating the aftermath of your accident.", "YTA he's not a mindreader and it's a twin not a single", "YTA\u2026your husband was also injured in the accident, but his injuries are not viable like yours. His behavior is a reaction to the trauma of the accident and likely feeling guilt over your serious physical injuries. It\u2019s not uncommon at all, especially if he were driving. \nYour sarcasm was unkind and dismissive of your husband\u2019s feelings.", "YTA for having no empathy towards your husband\u2019s emotions, for not actually communicating with him about how you\u2019re feeling too, and then then when he didn\u2019t understand a moment when you were being sarcastic, not clarifying, but using it against him later. (Right in that moment, you should\u2019ve clarified that you were being sarcastic and didn\u2019t actually want to share the bed - not waited til the next morning and then complained about it. How is that logical or kind? Imagine if someone did that to you.)\n\nAlso I think it was rude of you to be sarcastic in the first place given the context, but I don\u2019t know your relationship enough to say that for sure. I know some couples are more sarcastic with each other than I\u2019d be comfortable, so I guess I would just invite you to consider the context and think about that for yourself. But definitely YTA for the rest.", "Lmao YTA for even bringing this to Reddit.", "YTA. I feel like he's probably working through some trauma caused by the accident. It doesn't actually *matter* that the injuries weren't life-threatening - they *could have been*. A car accident can take your life so quickly, and most people really don't understand that until it happens. You're alive because you got lucky, not because it wasn't dangerous.\n\nAnd sure, maybe you're mentally fine - or maybe you're in shock, and are in denial about how serious this could have been. Either way, the fact that *you're* unaffected by this doesn't invalidate the very real effect it's had on *him*. He clearly hasn't handled it as well as you have, and tbh it's kinda fucked up that you're essentially telling him to man up. That's not how it works. He *can't* just \"get over it\". He saw both your lives flash before his eyes - it's going to take *time* for him to recover. Maybe show him some fucking empathy. There's a difference between \"Honey, I understand this has been hard on both of us, but I really need some space\" and \"Omg *obviously* I don't want you in bed with me - what's wrong with you?\" The second one is almost never helpful.", "YTA, you\u2019re complaining about your husband who loves you so much and was terrified of you being hurt, which is something everyone wishes they had. And also you can\u2019t communicate, tell him gently you need some space instead of being sarcastic and getting upset when he doesn\u2019t catch your sarcasm", "So you\u2019re telling me you got into a pretty serious accident, were seriously injured to the point of needing a medical bed, and you\u2019re wondering why he is being clingy? I have a feeling my man\u2019s is clingy because he realizes you could have died and he could have lost you. Was he driving? Throw on the guilt too\u2026 soft YTA just because you are blind to see what is going on and seem to brush it off as an annoyance. If this happened to my wife I don\u2019t think I\u2019d let her go for a while\u2026", "You are both traumatized but apparently he is more traumatized than you are. That\u2019s why he\u2019s clingy.", "NTA. I hope you heal quickly.", "NAH he needs comfort because he was terrified of losing you. You are repeatedly saying you need space, probably partly because you are in pain, and are getting ignored. Also sounds like youre kind of trapped by your limited mobility.", "NTA but you *are* the patient, so you have to advocate for what you need to get well. Tell Mel, \u201cHoney, I appreciate your affection, but I\u2019m feeling so claustrophobic from my immobility \u2014 I\u2019d love it if you could please give me some space.\u201d You may need to say it a few times before he gets it, we men can be thick-skulled. Good luck to you.", "YTA. But I don't think this is a big deal\n\nHe didn't get the sarcasm and you immediately felt cramped when he got in. Why didn't you just tell him then and there to get out?", "NAH.", "YTA,\n\nOne of the most important thing in a relationship is communication, maybe in your head you though you sounded sarcastic or maybe you thought he understood your sarcasm, but he didn't so you could have told him no when he was crawling into the bed.", "NTA- but is it possible he suffered a head injury?", "Why are you giving her shit about wanting personal space, especially when she has massive injuries. Husband should know better than squishing and squeezing wife in on a bed when her spine has to heal. \n\nBoohoo he's scared. She doesn't have to coddle him and allow her healing to be negatively affected because he's feeling emotions and doesn't know how to handle them properly. \n\nOP is NTA", "Sarcasm is a mild form of lying.", "Tbh it easily *could've* been that bad, though. People really underestimate how dangerous cars are. You lived because you were *lucky*, not because it wasn't a life-threatening situation. I'm guessing your husband has been emotionally impacted by that *way* more than you have. For you, it was a bad but survivable accident. For him, it sounds like he saw both your lives flash before his eyes.\n\nA little empathy wouldn't hurt. You don't have to kowtow to his every need, especially where it's harmful to your recovery - but there is a pretty significant difference between \"Hey babe, I love you and I know this has been hard for both of us, but I really need some space right now - can you give that to me?\" and \"What? *Obviously* I don't want you in bed with me! What's wrong with you, geez?\" And from your post, it sounds like what you said was closer to the second one. You don't have to be *cruel*, or dismissive of what he's going through, to get your needs across to him. You were *both* in the accident. It affected *both* of you. From this post, I really don't get the sense that you even *like* your husband.", "You injured your spine and broke your leg. You are sleeping in a medical bed. You were clearly seriously injured\u2026 curious, was your husband driving when the accident happened?", "I feel like you have a severe lack of empathy here. I am normally very touchy feely kinda person, but when I had a dream I lost my wife I was clingy for days. In that situation I would be clingy for months or even years. It\u2019s puts a whole new perspective on things.\n\nAlso let me guess, he was driving and he feels responsible.", "You\u2019re going to have to be specific about what \u201ca bit if space\u201d means. Literally tell him \u201cI need time alone until 1pm\u201d etc. \n\nAlso be honest and tell him you\u2019re not used to him being this affectionate so it will take time for you to adjust, and that the best way to show he cares is to support your healing. You\u2019re sorry you were sarcastic instead of direct, and going forward it\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s not a good idea for you to both cram in the bed, because that jeopardizes your healing process. You were both careless for letting that happen and should both agree not to do anything like that again. It\u2019s not safe for you. \n\nI think it\u2019s important for you to recognize the opportunity you have right now for a much deeper level of intimacy and connection with your husband. His behavior is overwhelming and probably somewhat annoying, but it\u2019s a genuine expression of love and desire to have a closer relationship with you. Don\u2019t you want that too?\n\nSarcasm destroys intimacy. It\u2019s not an honest way to communicate. It makes people protective of themselves, hesitant to be vulnerable. Your husband is wide open to you right now, which is rare. It\u2019s hard to maintain vulnerability on that level. He\u2019s not just pouting, he is truly hurt because he\u2019s trying so hard to be close to you that any minor rejection feels huge to him. While you shouldn\u2019t have to tiptoe around him, you can be kind. And be open. Don\u2019t squander the opportunity you have here to make your marriage stronger. Lean into the intimacy.", "That\u2019s it exactly, obviously men are capable of understanding sarcasm. Ridiculous to think otherwise.

Pain meds and a spinal injury are not great ingredients for wanting to snuggle all the time, and  Mel\u2019s guilt/gratitude should give way to OP\u2019s comfort. He\u2019s making this all about him, and he could actually cause a setback. Mel needs to be told (gently) that the care and support are appreciated, but that too much touch hurts, and to please back off.", "Oh shut up professor boundaries.
