I'm talking homemade pasta sauces, scratch baking, hell, sometimes imported seasonings. \n\nBut she only does it for herself.\n\nShe's been fine cooking when I ask her to do it for us, but only on rare occasions. When we're all busy and need to do 'DIY dinner' nights and can't all sit around the table, you can smell her homemade garlic pesto or vegan teriyaki stir fry all over the house, and it gets irritating. We get her ingredients that she uses up quickly and never makes meals to share with, and I'm getting annoyed.\n\nSo I asked her earlier tonight if she would start making dinner for us all more frequently (I didn't say every night) and she got annoyed and mouthy with me, saying she's drowning in school work, her internship, and her commissions (very talented digital artist) and can't \"babysit\" us because \"you never learned to cook\". She claims her sparse dinner preparations are a treat when she's up to the task and feeling nice, and she can't be expected to come up with something new and fresh every night. \n\nShe's doing it for herself anyway, why not for the rest of us? \n\nSo I told her to just do the dishes and go to her room. She did the dishes and stomped off and hasn't come out since, and my wife thinks I'm TA here, but I think I'm in line. She lives under my roof and doesn't pay rent, and she's already cooking every night for herself anyway.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677113055, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119jesv/aita_for_asking_my_step_daughter_to_cook_for_us/", "score": 4253, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm talking homemade pasta sauces, scratch baking, hell, sometimes imported seasonings. \n\nBut she only does it for herself.\n\nShe's been fine cooking when I ask her to do it for us, but only on rare occasions. When we're all busy and need to do 'DIY dinner' nights and can't all sit around the table, you can smell her homemade garlic pesto or vegan teriyaki stir fry all over the house, and it gets irritating. We get her ingredients that she uses up quickly and never makes meals to share with, and I'm getting annoyed.\n\nSo I asked her earlier tonight if she would start making dinner for us all more frequently (I didn't say every night) and she got annoyed and mouthy with me, saying she's drowning in school work, her internship, and her commissions (very talented digital artist) and can't \"babysit\" us because \"you never learned to cook\". She claims her sparse dinner preparations are a treat when she's up to the task and feeling nice, and she can't be expected to come up with something new and fresh every night. \n\nShe's doing it for herself anyway, why not for the rest of us? \n\nSo I told her to just do the dishes and go to her room. She did the dishes and stomped off and hasn't come out since, and my wife thinks I'm TA here, but I think I'm in line. She lives under my roof and doesn't pay rent, and she's already cooking every night for herself anyway.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Back when my stepfather was alive, he moved in permanently at the start of covid. At that point I was asked to cook for the family on a regular basis since my mom was working hard to adjust to online teaching and he was dealing with chronic pain. I\u2019m a pretty decent cook, but I didn\u2019t like the idea of it because cooking was something I did for me, as a hobby, and it was relaxing to me. I cooked for others as a sign that I cared about them. Having a demand placed on me made me feel unappreciated and resentful. I understood that I had the easiest time being the cook but every single day was a lot. Somehow they were incapable of making themselves food after that. Having the amount of food I cooked or ate policed was suffocating. At one point he even got in the habit of saying \u201cyou can start cooking now\u201d when he was hungry.

If so, I could possibly see how you might feel like that's worth the extra effort on her part of adding portions when she's already preparing one meal. But if you expect her to put in the time, you should reciprocate by making her dinner some nights to free up her schedule because it sounds like she may be fending for herself and refusing to cook for you out of frustration. \nBeyond that maybe the solution is to stop buying expensive special ingredients and then everyone just does their best with what they've got and no one has grounds for complaints.
