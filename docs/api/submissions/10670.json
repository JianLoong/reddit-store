I'm talking homemade pasta sauces, scratch baking, hell, sometimes imported seasonings. \n\nBut she only does it for herself.\n\nShe's been fine cooking when I ask her to do it for us, but only on rare occasions. When we're all busy and need to do 'DIY dinner' nights and can't all sit around the table, you can smell her homemade garlic pesto or vegan teriyaki stir fry all over the house, and it gets irritating. We get her ingredients that she uses up quickly and never makes meals to share with, and I'm getting annoyed.\n\nSo I asked her earlier tonight if she would start making dinner for us all more frequently (I didn't say every night) and she got annoyed and mouthy with me, saying she's drowning in school work, her internship, and her commissions (very talented digital artist) and can't \"babysit\" us because \"you never learned to cook\". She claims her sparse dinner preparations are a treat when she's up to the task and feeling nice, and she can't be expected to come up with something new and fresh every night. \n\nShe's doing it for herself anyway, why not for the rest of us? \n\nSo I told her to just do the dishes and go to her room. She did the dishes and stomped off and hasn't come out since, and my wife thinks I'm TA here, but I think I'm in line. She lives under my roof and doesn't pay rent, and she's already cooking every night for herself anyway.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677113055, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119jesv/aita_for_asking_my_step_daughter_to_cook_for_us/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm talking homemade pasta sauces, scratch baking, hell, sometimes imported seasonings. \n\nBut she only does it for herself.\n\nShe's been fine cooking when I ask her to do it for us, but only on rare occasions. When we're all busy and need to do 'DIY dinner' nights and can't all sit around the table, you can smell her homemade garlic pesto or vegan teriyaki stir fry all over the house, and it gets irritating. We get her ingredients that she uses up quickly and never makes meals to share with, and I'm getting annoyed.\n\nSo I asked her earlier tonight if she would start making dinner for us all more frequently (I didn't say every night) and she got annoyed and mouthy with me, saying she's drowning in school work, her internship, and her commissions (very talented digital artist) and can't \"babysit\" us because \"you never learned to cook\". She claims her sparse dinner preparations are a treat when she's up to the task and feeling nice, and she can't be expected to come up with something new and fresh every night. \n\nShe's doing it for herself anyway, why not for the rest of us? \n\nSo I told her to just do the dishes and go to her room. She did the dishes and stomped off and hasn't come out since, and my wife thinks I'm TA here, but I think I'm in line. She lives under my roof and doesn't pay rent, and she's already cooking every night for herself anyway.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She's not even an adult yet. You're lazy. Get off your ass and quit whining; learn to cook your own meals, jeez.

Back when my stepfather was alive, he moved in permanently at the start of covid. At that point I was asked to cook for the family on a regular basis since my mom was working hard to adjust to online teaching and he was dealing with chronic pain. I\u2019m a pretty decent cook, but I didn\u2019t like the idea of it because cooking was something I did for me, as a hobby, and it was relaxing to me. I cooked for others as a sign that I cared about them. Having a demand placed on me made me feel unappreciated and resentful. I understood that I had the easiest time being the cook but every single day was a lot. Somehow they were incapable of making themselves food after that. Having the amount of food I cooked or ate policed was suffocating. At one point he even got in the habit of saying \u201cyou can start cooking now\u201d when he was hungry.

If so, I could possibly see how you might feel like that's worth the extra effort on her part of adding portions when she's already preparing one meal. But if you expect her to put in the time, you should reciprocate by making her dinner some nights to free up her schedule because it sounds like she may be fending for herself and refusing to cook for you out of frustration. \nBeyond that maybe the solution is to stop buying expensive special ingredients and then everyone just does their best with what they've got and no one has grounds for complaints.

She enjoys it and you\u2019re making it a chore because you don\u2019t want to cook.\nThis attitude towards her schooling\u2026it\u2019s giving hater. \nEither way, you asked\u2026she gave her answer. The whole \u201cunder my roof\u201d tidbit is abusive\u2026she\u2019s a child.", "At least someone wants her to be succesful (hint: not you).", "YTA. You made your choices that led to you being \u201ctoo busy\u201d to cook. Why don\u2019t YOU, the adult, take responsibility for your choices and make the time to cook. Just because you paid for the supplies, doesn\u2019t mean she owes you a meal. That would be like expecting a child to make paintings for the whole family because you paid for the art supplies. Or having to put on a concert for the whole family because you paid for the instrument.", "In the same way your inability to cook is self imposed. No one told you not to learn to cook.", "God forbid she puts her education above your need for better quality of food on demand.", "The step dad is upset she isn\u2019t moving into the roll of the kitchen maid.  SD probably doesn\u2019t like OP so she refuses to have a meal with the rest of the family and chooses to make her own meals to avoid the confrontation.  SD also probably eats in her room while studying for the same reasons.  SD is also making plans to go NC and leave when she turns 18 and OP has no clue.  He\u2019s just upset she won\u2019t cook for him.  I bet if he was out for the night she would cook for the rest o the family.", "It doesn't say there is no plan. It says they have diy nights. Meaning they have planned nights were everyone figures out their own meals. That's common when there are multiple people/kids that are doing activities or have part time jobs. \n\nThe step-dad here wants the daughter to cook for him on diy nights. \n\nShe explained she is too busy with school work plus commissioned work to do that. A chore chart won't solve that.", "There\u2019s a chasm between running a household and doing a couple of chores on a regular basis. It\u2019s contributing to shared space and the household she also lives in.", "You're delusional. A teenager as young as 13 should be contributing something to a household, even with limited chores and if you didn't get that, then your parents failed you.", "I said HELP to run the household.  She's 17, not 7.  She should have chores, and cooking IS a completely valid chore and certainly within the realm of reasonable.  Good grief, she's not a preschooler, and certainly doesn't need to be coddled.", "All I\u2019m saying is he is not an asshole. I assume you are very young and don\u2019t have kids?", "the change from cooking for one to cooking for three is nothing; I literally cooked all the fucking time for my family when I was her age and didn't have to be forced to do it, on top of work, extra-curriculars and pursuing an education", "You're not necessarily wrong about OP being a dickbag, but this doesn't absolve the child of duties to their household, just like her being a dickbag doesn't absolve him of his duties to house and feed her. (ineptly though he apparently does this)", "Exactly this!", "Right !???", "So being asked to be an active participant in the household equates to kitchen maid? Also you\u2019re literally going on an assumption roll there. Where does it say she doesn\u2019t like him? Where does it say she\u2019s going NC? Where does it says she\u2019s eating in her room to avoid them? Where does it imply that if he was gone she would cook? You\u2019re going off one tiny instance and making all of these wild assumptions. She stormed off to her room because she was annoyed, teenagers are annoyed all the time it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going NC and hate their parent/step parent. She\u2019s of age where she can participate in chores in the household and cooking is one of those chores. It\u2019s not even close to be inappropriate to ask her to participate in the cooking rotation especially when she\u2019s using up all the community ingredients for only herself. It is a parents job to provide food, shelter, basic necessities and so on, however, children can also have chores and responsibilities and it\u2019s not some horrible thing nor does it mean a parent wants them to be a kitchen maid. That\u2019s some wild assuming you\u2019ve got going on.", "I think it would because then they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the DIY nights and everyone has nights where it\u2019s their chore to cook. So a night when say her mom or she is busy (her studying/ commission work and so on) he or the mom can cook, when he or the mom are busier on a night, she can cook and so on.", "Idk how we even got on the concept of chores.....that wasn't mentioned in the OP. \n\nThe OP is demanding a child cook for him because he's a sucky adult.", "Nope. Not delusional. Just a different perspective.", "I did my own laundry, made my own meals when I felt like it and was responsible for cleaning my room but that's it, I wasn't expected to do things for the entire household", "Good grief, let the 17 year old focus on school, interning, and preparing for adulthood. \n\nShe has plenty of time to run her own household in the future. \n\nActions like this are what turn 17 year olds into adults who don't talk to their parents.", "Why do you assume that? Being a parent doesn't change the fact that you should know how to cook as an adult", "Sounds like you're very passionate about having to do more than needed, sucks to suck\n\nAlso he asked she said no and he got mad that he couldn't reasonably force her to make him something so he sent her away", "But she's not being a dick bag. She cooks when he asks her to and cooks for herself on DIY nights. Don't have DIY nights if you want someone to cook for you, or at least contribute something to the meal itself if you want to benefit from someone's cooking.", "Keep in mind this is a step family.  So many details are left out.  How long has he been in her life? What was the incident that started her cooking her own meals?  Why is the mother the SD\u2019s mom not mentioned or what her opinion on the matter is.  Being that SD is 17 and refuses to cook when OP asks is a clear indication it\u2019s a problem between the two of them.  I bet the night she does cook it\u2019s when her mom asks.  OP also doesn\u2019t mention how many family members she would be cooking for and their ages.  If it\u2019s just the three of them then OP needs to grab a cookbook and figure it out.  If it\u2019s OP, mom, SD and other minor kids that\u2019s another situation,  OP gave as little information as possible to make SD seem like an entitled brat.  While this may be true in the end but to guide this post to that end without proper information is one sided.  SD may be a brat but we don\u2019t have all the info.", "\u2026and I don\u2019t disagree that OP is TA. But cooking the family dinners every night IS a chore. I think that\u2019s our disconnect", "Are you from one of those cultures where you don't even get a job with school?", "Ok, but what did you do when you entered your late teens and stopped being 12?", "Who said he didn\u2019t know how to cook? There is a difference between not knowing how to cook, which is something that only applies to a child, and not being a good cook, or enjoying cooking.", "sounds like typical individualism pretending that being selfish is a brave moral stand and not just pathetic behaviour of children", "he contributes the food", "I agree with you and on that same note it\u2019s the point I\u2019m also trying to make. Because it\u2019s a post on the internet, we have extremely limited information and we will never really know the ins and outs. I do think though that at her age it isn\u2019t outlandish to be asked to cook during the week for your family. Especially if it\u2019s something you really love doing and you\u2019re good at. That\u2019s not to say that OP shouldn\u2019t also be doing the cooking and if he doesn\u2019t know how, learning to. My point is, that with the information we have, it\u2019s not out of pocket to ask her to make extra portions of what she\u2019s already making or to set up a chart where everyone has a day that they cook. I had a chart like that in my home when I was that age and it was my mom and 4 other siblings and as a teenager did it annoy me? Sure because I was a teenager but it was a fair ask because everyone contributed their part. That\u2019s pretty much what I was trying to say", "She shouldn't be cooking dinners for her family every night.", "Huh? Are you from one of those cultures where you make up random ass stories because someone has a different perspective than you?", "The exact same thing, I was never made responsible for anyone's mess but my own", "Because if you can't make anything besides noodles and pizza at almost 50 years old then you're willingly choosing not to learn how to cook \n\nYes I'm sure the daughter was just born with the talent of cooking, she didn't learn at all it just magically happened", "Op did his story when his stepdaughter made the comment not her fault he doesn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t counter it so probably true.", "Aw you're big mad", "Like he should and she also has her mother so it's not like it's just him and it's not just his house", "If everyone rotates DIY dinners it would be fair.  The way OP wrote it is he wants her to take over DIY nights.  It seems he doesn\u2019t get a good meal on those nights and is jealous that SD has a nice meal.  He ask she said no, but now he wants to force the issue.  How much you want to bet he\u2019s the type that sits at the table and waits for the meal to be placed on the table.  On DIY night he probably has to put his meal 8n the microwave, either leftovers or frozen dinner and he doesn\u2019t like it.", "I agree. But I think compromise could\u2019ve been possible in this situation (like \u201chey, when you cook, please make enough for everyone every couple of times, okay?\u201d). I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an unfair request for a 17yo who\u2019s already cooking", "Ok, I'm sorry to hear your parents failed you I guess, and kept you infantile when they should have been preparing you for becoming an adult?", "That\u2019s not the way I read the post but being that it\u2019s something we\u2019re reading everyone can interpret it differently. In regard to the jealousy comment, I personally think it\u2019s rude to use up all communal household ingredients as fast as she is and only make portions for yourself but I am also in agreement with you that everyone needs to be taking turns cooking. However, we don\u2019t know the current lay out or amount of diy nights and nights where meals are cooked for everyone. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to assume he\u2019s someone who sits around waiting for everyone to serve him.", "No. She's a child doing something for her own enjoyment. \n\nIf she was painting, should she paint enough for the family too? \n\nI very much think it's unfair to ask a child who is cooking for enjoyment and relaxation to make it into a chore.", "Lol so because I know how to look after myself I'm failing? Least I won't be cooking noodles and pizza and depending on my child to cook for me at 45"]}
