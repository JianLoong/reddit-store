I'm talking homemade pasta sauces, scratch baking, hell, sometimes imported seasonings. \n\nBut she only does it for herself.\n\nShe's been fine cooking when I ask her to do it for us, but only on rare occasions. When we're all busy and need to do 'DIY dinner' nights and can't all sit around the table, you can smell her homemade garlic pesto or vegan teriyaki stir fry all over the house, and it gets irritating. We get her ingredients that she uses up quickly and never makes meals to share with, and I'm getting annoyed.\n\nSo I asked her earlier tonight if she would start making dinner for us all more frequently (I didn't say every night) and she got annoyed and mouthy with me, saying she's drowning in school work, her internship, and her commissions (very talented digital artist) and can't \"babysit\" us because \"you never learned to cook\". She claims her sparse dinner preparations are a treat when she's up to the task and feeling nice, and she can't be expected to come up with something new and fresh every night. \n\nShe's doing it for herself anyway, why not for the rest of us? \n\nSo I told her to just do the dishes and go to her room. She did the dishes and stomped off and hasn't come out since, and my wife thinks I'm TA here, but I think I'm in line. She lives under my roof and doesn't pay rent, and she's already cooking every night for herself anyway.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677113055, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119jesv/aita_for_asking_my_step_daughter_to_cook_for_us/", "score": 387, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm talking homemade pasta sauces, scratch baking, hell, sometimes imported seasonings. \n\nBut she only does it for herself.\n\nShe's been fine cooking when I ask her to do it for us, but only on rare occasions. When we're all busy and need to do 'DIY dinner' nights and can't all sit around the table, you can smell her homemade garlic pesto or vegan teriyaki stir fry all over the house, and it gets irritating. We get her ingredients that she uses up quickly and never makes meals to share with, and I'm getting annoyed.\n\nSo I asked her earlier tonight if she would start making dinner for us all more frequently (I didn't say every night) and she got annoyed and mouthy with me, saying she's drowning in school work, her internship, and her commissions (very talented digital artist) and can't \"babysit\" us because \"you never learned to cook\". She claims her sparse dinner preparations are a treat when she's up to the task and feeling nice, and she can't be expected to come up with something new and fresh every night. \n\nShe's doing it for herself anyway, why not for the rest of us? \n\nSo I told her to just do the dishes and go to her room. She did the dishes and stomped off and hasn't come out since, and my wife thinks I'm TA here, but I think I'm in line. She lives under my roof and doesn't pay rent, and she's already cooking every night for herself anyway.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She's not even an adult yet. You're lazy. Get off your ass and quit whining; learn to cook your own meals, jeez.

Back when my stepfather was alive, he moved in permanently at the start of covid. At that point I was asked to cook for the family on a regular basis since my mom was working hard to adjust to online teaching and he was dealing with chronic pain. I\u2019m a pretty decent cook, but I didn\u2019t like the idea of it because cooking was something I did for me, as a hobby, and it was relaxing to me. I cooked for others as a sign that I cared about them. Having a demand placed on me made me feel unappreciated and resentful. I understood that I had the easiest time being the cook but every single day was a lot. Somehow they were incapable of making themselves food after that. Having the amount of food I cooked or ate policed was suffocating. At one point he even got in the habit of saying \u201cyou can start cooking now\u201d when he was hungry.

If so, I could possibly see how you might feel like that's worth the extra effort on her part of adding portions when she's already preparing one meal. But if you expect her to put in the time, you should reciprocate by making her dinner some nights to free up her schedule because it sounds like she may be fending for herself and refusing to cook for you out of frustration. \nBeyond that maybe the solution is to stop buying expensive special ingredients and then everyone just does their best with what they've got and no one has grounds for complaints.

That's another one.", "He's edited the OP because so many called out his creep vibes. \n\nIn his follow-up comments, he said she chose to go to a \"fancy art school\" 30 mins away.", "Idk. Sort by old. Maybe someone quoted it. \n\nEnough of us caught the first time around.", "You're literally crazy and I feel sorry for your multiple children.\n\nNowhere in this post does it say that she doesn't know how to grow food. \n\nNowhere in this post does it say she uses special expensive ingredients to cook. Food is bought for the household and everyone can use as is.\n\nNowhere does it say she thinks she's too good for cheap food, nor that she can't make cheap food good.\n\nShe has her own income as a minor, so I don't see why tf she would run off with some loser who can pay for a nice restaurant. Not sure what the hell that has to do with forcing your kid to grow their own food if they want to cook nice meals. \n\n> She can have the dry chicken or learn to heat up ramen noodles or she can grow a tomato plant. Her choice. \n\nWhy are these the only option? Why don't we take it a step further and have her grow and raise the chicken she wants to eat, and slaughter it herself. How about she grows trees and makes her own clothes and paper while she's at it. And how about she mines her own metal to make the cooking tools. Can your kid do that? Or do you just want to punish her for not making a meal for an incompetent grown ass man.", "OP said he can't cook anything but pasta and pizza no mention of his wife as far as I can tell", "YTA- huge.  Does her mother know this is what you expect and think of her?  This girl seems to be an incredible, smart and driven young lady.\n You sound like a jealous lazy person.", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s a child. Stop acting like she owes you something.", "She\u2019s a teenager! What kind of pathetic parent speaks about their child like that?! Get over yourself YTA", "She\u2019s selfish, rude, and won\u2019t cook your dinner every night. \n\nBut you have nothing against her. Right.", "YTA ~ she\u2019s a minor child and under no obligation to make sure you, a grown ass man, are fed. The fact that your a grown person and the best you can cook is pizza or some noodles, yeah, you should be ashamed of yourself. There\u2019s nothing at all stopping you from learning to cook. Avail yourself of the richness and variety of the internet and learn, like the child your complaining about did.", "If she does have those traits, I wonder where she learned those behaviors from. It's a mystery. \n\nWhy are you judging her for traveling further to a school that better meets her needs and talents?", "Dude I\u2019m stoned and don\u2019t actually care that much. She\u2019s being a jerk, she could just do it. She needs to stop being a little b, same goes to you little nitpicker.", "the pasta sauce comment had me dying right away.

I wasn't allowed to do any cooking though.", "Why doesn't your husband make two cakes?", "The bot post doesn\u2019t say anything about her appearance. I really wish I could have the whole story.

Would you mind pointing it out?", "Guess you're going to have to point it out cause I don't see it.", "How do you do that?", "YTA. Takes a lot more to prepare for everyone (how many people) than one meal.\nYou could offer to pay her if she\u2019s that good a cook, but set maybe 2 nights a week if she has time.  She\u2019s certainly very busy.  So I guess you showed her for having the audacity to tell you no, made her do the dishes, go to her room and now she\u2019s not coming out. Can\u2019t imagine why.  From the person who read your original post you don\u2019t seem to respect this girl or her choices.", "Because don't you get it, that's time she could be spending cooking for him? /s", "Stoned and entitled lol.", "We were poor newlyweds and only had the two cake pans, and he always started late at night, and hoLY CRAP he could have made two!!\n\nNow I'm angry and stupid.", "I'm not a help desk agent. \n\nIf it's no longer there, idk what to tell you. \ud83d\ude10", "I had to cook for my family twice a week at the age of 15.

Maybe I missed something but from my perspective it looks like you might be wrong about him commenting on her appearance.
