Go get therapy  or stay home with your animals.\n\nEta Sorry spelled Garry's name wrong and NTA", "NTA. Even if she has obtained a prescription from a mental health professional for an emotional support goat (which seems unlikely) they are not covered under ADA, and people don\u2019t have to allow them entrance. \n\nAnd if she\u2019s one of the many who just decided on their own to call their animal bud an ESA, she\u2019s the AH for making a mockery of something intended to help people who actually need support.", "NTA.\n\nIt's a fecking goat lol.", "NTA An emotional support goat? The most ridiculous thing I have ever heard in my life. From what I understand an emotional support animal is usually a properly trained dog. Just because it's an animal and you like it just make it a proper support animal. This world is screwed up and sometimes delusional and unfortunately your sister stepped into it.", "INFO: has a doctor certified this as a necessary ESA for her or as a therapy animal (the kind of trained service animal that would serve a similar purpose), or has she decided this herself?\n\nEach of these things have a different response. Even extremely well trained ESA animals don't always go places or go everywhere with their human and are often support at home or in the most stressful of public situations and often only go slightly more places than they would if they were simply a pet.\n\n\nA therapy animal has much more extensive training and goes absolutely everywhere as a medical need for various conditions. This obviously should be accommodated if that is the case with no questions asked.\n\n\nIf it's just something she decided on hed own then as of now theres no reason to trust her non-professional opinion and you should encourage her to see a doctor regarding this.", "Honestly I find that goats the the funniest animals ever. I totally understand why she has an emotional support goat. \n\nBut from my experience owning a goat, it\u2019s a terrible idea to have it inside your house. Those things shit all over the place, stink to high heaven and can be quite feisty. \n\nI\u2019d love to have a goat at my wedding, but I understand that it\u2019s an acquired taste. \n\nNTA.

The only thing needed for an ESA is that the owner has a disability and the animal helps mitigate that disability. That said, ESAs absolutely don't have any public access rights - that's only for service animals, and those DO have to be either dogs or miniature horses (in the US). So sister can have an emotional support goat, but it doesn't have the right to go anywhere with her.", "I don't know why everyone is so weirded out by goat being an ESA. Goats are as smart and affectionate as dogs and can bond with humans. But OP is NTA because  it's their house and their rules.

People do all kinds of weird things. As someone who trains working dogs the misinformation around service animals drives me crazy. ESA are not service animals. They don't need to be trained and they are no laws that protect them. Most people buy the vest thinking they can just bring their dog place. That undermines real service animals who actually help people. \n\nOP is NTA.", "There is no certification for either service animals or ESAs in the US. In addition, only dogs and miniature horses are eligible to be service animals, and only service animals have public access rights.

ESAs have absolutely no public access rights outside of pet-friendly venues - they can't go anywhere a pet can't go.\n\nThe sister can certainly have a goat as an ESA, but OP is under no obligation to allow the goat in their home or anywhere else. Doesn't matter if she's seen a doctor about the goat or not. NTA", "\u201cUnder Title II and III of the ADA, service animals are limited to dogs. However, entities must make reasonable modifications in policies to allow individuals with disabilities to use miniature horses if they have been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for individuals with disabilities.\u201d\n\nSo no. This should not be accommodated with no questions asked since goats don\u2019t qualify on a federal level as service animals.

That fucker shit EVERYWHERE. And it's not like one turd plopped in the middle of the floor.

Per the [ADA website](https://www.ada.gov/resources/service-animals-faqs/): Does the ADA require that service animals be certified as service animals? A. No. Covered entities may not require documentation, such as proof that the animal has been certified, trained, or licensed as a service animal, as a condition for entry. There are individuals and organizations that sell service animal certification or registration documents online. These documents do not convey any rights under the ADA and the Department of Justice does not recognize them as proof that the dog is a service animal.", "That may be true, but you are on an American platform where nearly 50% of the users (from a quick preliminary search) *are* American. \n\nIf nearly half the global users from over 150 countries are American, it is just as easy to say it is to on those other users to clarify. It\u2019s easy to understand why Americans assume that most people on Reddit are talking about the US unless stated otherwise or in a subreddit \u2026 the user numbers speak for themselves.

No, they buy them on the internet.  Then they submit them to make them legit. Therefore, places feel forced to accept them because the 504 is legally accepted. It's wrong.. but, it's how they get around the laws.", "Honey, you aren't getting it. You're  coming from a very ethnocentric frame of mind. Not every place (country, city, state, etc.) legitimizes ESA documents.  Most governments do not issue them and many of them do not legitimize them."]}
