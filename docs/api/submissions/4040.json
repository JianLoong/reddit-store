Eclectic music taste that we had a big argument about last night. \n\nWe live together and have a great sound system in the shared areas of the house (kitchen, living room, dining room, etc) and when I play music, I usually put on an album or two to listen to, straight through. \n\nMy girlfriend likes to put on playlists, and last night she put on, in this order... I honestly just have to write out this playlist because it's that crazy. \n\nFriends in low places by Garth Brooks (a very country song) \n\nThen the theifing magipe by Rossini (an intense classical music song) \n\nThen pink rover by scene queen (a weird metal / pop mix) \n\nThen dangerous by Cascada (a 2000s pop song) \n\nThen Dogma by KMFDM (this metal / electronic song with spoken word lyrics) \n\nAfter that point, I asked her if she could just pick one playlist or album, or at least something more normal, and put it on because her music was kinda all over the place. \n\nShe said that she was playing a playlist she made, and that it was what she wanted to listen to when she was doing chores.\n\nI, kinda joking around, but also a little annoyed, asked what kinda playlist it was, because it seemed unhinged. \n\nShe was like \"uhh it's my cleaning playlist? It's just good music to get up and move around or dance to? Like high energy stuff, you know\" \n\nI was like \"there's girly pop, classical music, and industrial noise in there tho?\" And she was like \"yeah that's some of what I like?\" \n\nI asked her if she could put on something a little less chaotic and she said she was cleaning our kitchen, the least I could do is not talk shit about her music tastes. \n\nI was like \"but you've gotta realize it's a little out there, right?\" And she was like \"Nah these are all bangers, why are you being such a dick? I don't talk shit when you wanna listen to the same 3 bands everyday\" \n\nShe was getting really annoyed with me so I dropped it, and she played another hour or so of honestly the most random playlist I've ever heard\n\nI feel kinda conflicted, because on one hand her music was weird af and I feel like it's just common courtesy to play stuff that's at least kinda chill and could be background music in a shared space? Instead of like the most intense or weird song from every genre possible. \n\nBut on the other hand, I kinda got the impression she doesn't love my music either and just never said anything till I did. \n\nAITA for asking my girlfriend to put something more normal on?", "created_utc": 1670267246, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdg7fb/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_if_she_could_play/", "score": 2221, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's all subjective and what one person likes could be hated by the next. You have no right to tell others that they have \"weird\" or \"chaotic\" tastes when yours are likely just as said adjectives. Y'all could just put in earbuds/earplugs or whatever if it's *that* bothersome.", "YTA but I have a suggestion: why don't you take over all the chores? That way you won't have to listen to your gf's playlists while she's cleaning. \n\nSeriously, there is no violation involved when people mix genres of music. You might need to loosen up a bit.", "YTA  \n\n\nShe enjoys different music than you do, and she doesn't give you shit when your bands are on.

Chill background music doesn't do that for some people.", "YTA. She's listening to what she wants to listen to while doing chores. You sound controlling.", "YTA\n\nDude, have you ever listened to the radio in the car - most channels will play an eclectic list. Who the hell cares if the playlist is a bunch of unrelated songs strung together. Music does not have to be listened to as one solid unit or one solid genre.\n\nIf you get to enjoy whatever music you want then she has the same right. Don't dictate what other people are allowed to listen to in a shared space. She has just as much right to the sound system as you do.", "I\u2019m gonna say this once so listen.

It's not fair to criticize your girlfriend's music taste and tell her to play something more \"normal.\" It's her playlist and she should be able to listen to whatever she wants while doing chores.

Next time, try to be more open-minded and respect her music choices.", "YTA- imagine having enough time to care about what other people play while they're literally cleaning... and cleaning a shared space no less, she's literally doing something that benefits you... You're weird and controlling. Let your GF listen to what she wants you weirdo", "YTA so so much. \nI listen to the same type of playlist, so do most of the people I know so to you're the weird one but I wouldnt even dream of shitting on your music preference. Doing so while you're cleaning a shared space is such a dick move. Honestly, if you're like this in more aspects of life, I hope your partner moves on real quick.", "YTA! \n\nThe fact you call it 'normal music' is a dead give away. Accept she has a different taste in music, and, believe it or not, it is a great topic to talk about.", "YTA. I like your girlfriend, as she doesn\u2019t seem to put up with your shit. It\u2019s her personal music preference, you don\u2019t have to like it. Taste in music is subjective; what\u2019s eclectic to you obviously isn\u2019t to your girlfriend. Also, she was cleaning the shared space and you had the male-daucity to police her music choices?", "YTA. Your girlfriend was CLEANING your shared space and mess, listening to her own custom playlist, and you have the nerve to be annoyed???

You do know that music has no gender, don\u2019t you??", "Neurodivergent brain here, and music in the background is a big deal for me.  So I really get it if the music being played doesn't work for you.  But what is also **never** going to work for you is trying to get it changed by making fun of the music and therefore the person playing the  music.  And honestly, that's what you were doing.  You didn't like her music and you made it abundantly clear.  And you're probably right, she doesn't like your music, but she **wasn't** rude about it.  \n\nIf it's genuinely bothering you (and there are lots of reasons that could be the case) then you both need to come up with a considerate and non-judgemental compromise that works for you both.  A usual compromise is headphones.  But that has to be for both of you, not just one of you.  It's not fair if one person gets to listen to it out loud if it bothers the other person.  \n\nAlso, you didn't try to understand her groupings and what made them work for her.  She probably would have loved if you at least were curious and interested instead of dismissive and judgemental.  \n\nYTA but there's still time to fix things, apologize for the way you handled it, and talk to her about a way for you both to enjoy your own music tastes without it being a problem.  And straight up ask her if she was \"putting up\" with yours and just being kind and not saying anything.  And then if she was, thank her for doing what you failed to do and promise to be kinder to her in the future.", "YTA. Music taste is different, nothing else to say. When you live together you will have to accept that sometimes your SO does stuff you doesn't like, eg like watching movies or videos you find annoying or listen to music you don't like. You both need to find your equilibrium. As long as she only does it during cleaning does sound manageable.", "YTA. Sure that kind of list would annoy me too. She still has as much of a right to listen to her music as you do, especially if it makes cleaning more enjoyable for her.", "Yta, she has a variety of tastes, nothing wrong with that. Man you would hate my music choices, cause I can go from Italian opera, to heavy metal throat music, to pop music to Eminem to silly bops.\n\nIf the music makes them happy, what's wrong? Maybe you'll learn to expand your taste in music.", "YTA. I don't normally listen to whole albums. I don't normally like all of the songs on one. All of my playlists have a pretty big variety. I have a few more individualized ones. But I like a lot of different styles, artists, songs and genres. There's nothing wrong with that. She was cleaning. Let her listen to what she wants.", "YTA.\n\nMe and my bf have little music in common and very different music tastes and he listens to heavy stuff. Like you can't even hear or listen to what is happening. Sure some stuff he doesn't play loudly cause it does make me nauseated because my Brain can't register all the noise. But he still plays music and that's fine because it's our house.\n\nEven if I don't like the music he can still play it but he is considerate about it. But I would never tell disrespect his music taste. Even though our music taste is different he has opened me up to  many genre's  and he actually has such good taste in music and I also opened up music to him. I got into kpop and he has groups that he likes (they arent like bboy or girly groups more like edm.) and we actually found a group that is a mixture of what we both like.\n\nIn a relationship you are open to the other persons interested and u take interest in them and even if you don't you accept it. She lives there too and it's her home aswell. I listen to music I never thought I would and same with him. It's good to be open.", "YTA\n\nWhat a person likes can be very personal to them.

I'm sure she doesn't appreciate your music either. At least she was being productive - what were you doing to help? Nothing, you were the exact opposite of helpful. If I was her I would have shut off the music and told her to clean the house your own self.", "YTA\n\nAnd please share the full playlist because those are all bangers and I need more ideas for *my* cleaning playlist", "Yta, that was all good music. You\u2019re just a prudish jerk. How did you get such a cool gf?", "Yes you are most definitely the asshole. \nDo you complain about the radio not playing a single album at a time too? \nWho cares if it's all over the place. Why do you feel the need to control something so simple?\nIt makes her happy and it's not unbearable music, so who cares. \nLighten up.", "YTA\n\nThere\u2019s no such thing as \u201cnormal\u201d when it comes to music. You two clearly have two different music preferences and if you were so upset by her music, that she listens to when she cleans, then maybe YOU can help her clean house and turn off the playlist sooner", "YTA - put on headphones or help her clean so you can have a say in what is played", "YTA for \u201cnormal\u201d alone", "YTA\n\nIf it was like a car ride or something I'd agree. But she's doing a chore and wants to listen to music while doing it for a bit. It sounds annoying to listening to but if it's only while cleaning just put headphones on for awhile. Or you could offer to do the chore so she doesn't play her music while doing it. Up to you.", "YTA\n\nOpen your mind and you might discover some non-mainstream music you really like.  Does she rag on you for having no depth to your musical taste?", "YTA sounds like your girlfriend has better taste in music than you, the idea of Rossini and Cascada on the same playlist makes me overwhelmingly happy.\n\nThat\u2019s not the issue though, if she\u2019s doing chores let her have whatever creature comforts she wants.", "YTA.\n\nGo listen to your Nickleback in the corner.", "Clean the house yourself or SHUT UP. YTA. geez.", "YTA and what the hell? This sounds like selfish, controlling behavior on your part.", "YTA\r  \n\r  \nWhy are you trying to dictate how she sets up her playlists? Mine are all over the place too, it may seem random but it's a mix of music from various artists I enjoy when I don't want to listen to an album start to finish. That's what my record player is for. \r  \n\r  \nShe sounds like she's got a broad taste in music, that's not exactly a bad trait for someone to have.", "YTA. Why are you so judgy about her music choices? Because they are eclectic? You're not special for listening to a narrower music spectrum. She's right, she's never commented on yours, because it's not her business to judge your music. Try to be as considerate.", "YTA - it sounds like your only complaint is because of the randomness of her music? Like who in the world complains about that? You are not the same people, so how you choose to listen to music does not dictate the way she does/should.", "YTA. If you hate your girlfriend\u2019s playlist because of how \u201crandom\u201d it is, then you would hate my playlist as well. Some people can\u2019t just do one genre and album at a time they need the variety. Your girlfriend\u2019s playlist is actually extremely similar to how mine go. \nCurrent songs on my playlists are \nPossessed (prince), Insane in the brain, tictactoe, music music music, love me harder, rumors, man I feel like a women, shady, dear society, brand new man, and some other songs that include a mixture of pop, rock and country. Then after a few songs we get to aim for the head; which is a very Halloween sounding song, a couple songs later we get grandma got run over by a reindeer. Continue this random mixture for about 3000 songs for 8 hours in a row 5 days a week. \nThis is also only one playlist. The other playlist is a mix of prince, Paul anka, kiss, ac/dc, Elvis, bon Jovi, ect.", "YTA.\nShe didn't want background music, she wanted upbeat stuff to clean to. To clean your kitchen. \nSome people use music as background, some people use it to energise or simply enjoy the music, a playlist of their favourite songs will most likely span several genres..  my running playlist has Bob Marley, Warner and ACDC on it.\nFriends in Low Places is definitely a banger, as is the Rossini. \nI'll check out the others as soon as I've finished singing along with Garth.", "YTA.  I kinda want your GF to send me her playlist because it really sounds like a couple of mine and totally what I listen to when I need to get a lot of shit done in a short amount of time. (And absolute points from me on the KMFDM because it seems like no one I know has even heard of them).", "YTA, you\u2019re a snob. People like you exist in the outside world already, your girlfriend just want to be in a safe space (her living space) where she can be herself without the judgment but man was she wrong.", "INFO: so, while she was cleaning your shared space, you just watched and criticised her music choices?", "YTA, let your gf listen to what she wants, like she said, she doesn't talk shit when you wanna listen to the same 3 bands everyday. If it really bothers you, they sell an almost unlimited variety of noise canceling headphones.", "YTA, of course.  It would be nice if you had similar music tastes, but you don't.  So you switch off listening to each other's music without complaint, or you make some other agreement that works for you BOTH!  Not an agreement that serves only one of you, which is what you are suggesting.", "Definitely YTA I am sure you wouldn't like many of my Playlist as I have eclectic taste. It can run from the rat pack to classical to lizzo and anything in between.", "YTA - as a general rule, I don't think it's great to be pretentious at home. She wants energy, and she's listening to music for the beat. Plenty of people do that, myself included. My husband listens to beautiful ambient music and soundtracks to cerebral films all day in the background. When he's with me, we just dance and have fun. You can have both.\n\nThose moments are for her and not about you, so just let her listen to what she wants without commentary. You sound like you want to put Baby in a corner. \ud83d\ude2d", "YTA \nIt's her house too, she should be able to listen to whatever music she's into.\nI also have an eclectic music taste and my playlists go from metal all the way to Disney songs. When I'm cleaning I listen to what I want. If my husband doesn't want to listen to it he goes in the other room or puts in headphones.", "YTA,\n\nIts music she likes.   you listen to the same 3 bands every day.  To some people that is not normal.    You don't respect that your GF has free will and choice.   If it is not to your liking it must not be normal. You are that guy.", "100% YTA  you're placing judgment on her taste in music. Who are you to decide her music is weird. That's what she wants. Many many people do Playlist and don't stick to a genere. Just because you feel like you need to stick to an album  doesn't mean that's the only or correct way.  Go to the bedroom  ask her to lower it a little and you listen to something else on your phone with headphones. How dare ypu tell her her music isn't normal", "YTA. Your girlfriend sounds like she\u2019s got my taste in music, especially in KMFDM. My own mix is eclectic as fuck also. Expand your horizons and stop being basic as fuck.", "Dude your girlfriend\u2019s playlist is not the crazy thing in this post. YTA.", "YTA, As soon as a guy starts the \"be a normal girl\" with me, I am out the door, be grateful she cleans.", "YTA \n\n\"Normal is a setting on a washing machine \"-Me. I'm a person who happens to be disabled. Your comment was rude. Not only to your girlfriend, but to other people. \n\nTaste is music is individual thing.   You don't have to like her taste. You don't have to appreciate it. What you said was disrespectful and dismissive. You are aware that she has eclectic musical taste. You knew it was a Playlist that she made.\n\nHer musical taste is her musical taste.\n\nYou were needlessly cruel and hurtful.", "So YTA, I love my playlists and my albums.  I play what I want when I want.  Like you I have a decent system in most of the house, and I play what I want, if someone told me to change, I would tell them in some very choice words, to forth and reproduce.", "YTA for saying her music isn't normal and yours was. It may be from different genres but all the music she played is/was very popular music. And she was using it to be motivated to clean your shared space. Don't be so narrow minded and listen to what else is out there.", "YTA, and except for that classical piece I think all those songs sound like songs that could be on my cleaning playlist. \n\nYou just apparently don't like uptempo metal and industrial which is fine, not everyone likes the same stuff, and if you're both just hanging out it might make sense to choose music you both like but since she was cleaning it makes sense to put on cleaning music. \n\nAlso, what kind of system is it that you can't limit the music to the space she's in (kitchen) my husband and I have wildly different tastes in music and we just play our own stuff in the room we're actually in and often do not have music on when we're in the same room or choose something from the very very limited amount of music we both like.", "YTA. So what you mean when you say \u201cshared spaces\u201d is \u201cshared spaces as long as I get my way all the time.\u201d If you can listen to your music, she can listen to hers. It would be great if you could find music that you both enjoy equally, but if you can\u2019t, you\u2019ll just have to take turns.", "YTA and apparently the playlist police too!", "YTA, it's incredibly NORMAL to have a shuffle play list that's not all the same genre.", "YTA. You're projecting your music tastes on your girlfriend. Some people like the structure of an album or a specific genre (this sounds like you). Others like a little bit of everything (this sounds like your girlfriend). Asking her to change her music is disrespecting something that is a personal taste for your girlfriend. If your tastes in music bother each other so much, perhaps some headphones can help both of you.", "YTA for how you approached it. I have a playlist very much like hers\u2014it\u2019s my Be Happy playlist, over 8 hours of music that makes me happy and uplifts me and it jumps all over the place in terms of genres. You\u2019d hate it. Then again, I\u2019d hate listening to an album through fully like you do. If you\u2019re annoyed by her taste in music and it\u2019s distracting you, ask if she can use headphones. Don\u2019t judge her taste just because it\u2019s not your \u201cnormal.\u201d", "YTA \n\n>\"Nah these are all bangers, why are you being such a dick? I don't talk shit when you wanna listen to the same 3 bands everyday\" \n\nGotta admit she's making great points. I don't know what specifically is weird about her music. I don't know all the artists listed but it sounds like you just don't like the same music she does or even weirder it's just not a playlist you would make because the order of songs and variety of types of music bug you.\n\nYou didn't say you were working and the music distracts you, you're just really weird about how other people sequence playlists that aren't specifically for you. Why not wear headphones since it bothers you? Like I want to say this is fake because even though people can be very particular about music you're focusing on the sequence of the playlist while also calling the music itself weird. But it does sound like a weird music snob thing. I love to sequence playlists \"perfectly\" but I also just throw whatever on there and certainly don't care about how someone else makes a Playlist", "YTA - her playlist, her choices.\n\nAnd if you think THATS a strange mix\u2026 you really do not want to see mine!", "YTA - if she is doing chores she gets to play what she wants\n\nIf the music is interrupting your work or phone calls or whatever, then you can of course ask that it be turned down. But it's pretty rude to judge her musical tastes and demand she only cater to yours.", "YTA. I really want to know what kind of music you play when it\u2019s your turn, what are these albums that are so normal.", "YTA.  I am totally obsessed with Tori Amos and play her music daily for myself.  My partner doesn\u2019t really care about her, but never asks me to turn it off (though I save most of my obsessing for when I can really enjoy the music alone on my headphones after a big fatty) - she listens to Sia pretty much every morning when she gets ready for work, and I don\u2019t care - in fact, I love Sia!\n\nMusic is one of the most important things to me and I love allllll kinds - perhaps open up your ears and brain more to new ideas and new artists.  \n\nINFO: what are the same 3 bands you listen to over and over again?\n\nHave your gf listen to this banger, I also dare you to listen to it (it\u2019s en fran\u00e7ais):\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=H2L2KvIbNCk", "Yta. My Playlist is the same way. It's literally all over the place because I like more than one kind of music. It's normal to listen to different kinds of music.", "Info, what are your three bands?", "YTA\n\nKMFDM rules, but that's beside the point.  Why does it freaking bother you so much?  She wants to listen to music, and (this is a key point) doesn't necessarily consider it \"background noise\".  She's cleaning the kitchen, let her do what she wants for an hour.  \n\n\nBecause how it sounds from here is that you're saying \"it's common courtesy to play the music that I personally like\"", "I'm gonna say YTA. I listen to everything from country to Disney to pop,  death Metal,  rap, classical and my spouse thinks it's endearing and adorable. \n\nGarth brooks,  Bach, Hannah Montana,  Queen, buddy Holly, A7X.\nCome on.  Is this the hill your going to end a relationship in?", "INFO: Can I get the rest of this playlist please", "Your hatred of variety is not a normal state of mind. Is this some sort of young people thing that I am too old to understand? Have you ever heard of a radio. They play different songs.\n\nI can't call you an asshole tho, but your music arrangement is unsustainable if it's only things you like or nothing.", "WTF is \"normal\" music?\n\nI like your gf's playlist. Thieving Magpie by Rossini--really anything by Rossini--is good housecleaning music. Mozart's 25th Symphony is, too. And Garth Brooks! Anything that gets you moving is a winner. She's got my kind of musical taste. \n\nYTA. Get some noise-canceling headphones and listen to your stuff if you hate hers so much.", "YTA. Minus the Garth Brooks, that sounds like an epic Playlist.", "YTA and you need to expand your horizons.  \n\nI love pretty much most music.  I think a good sized chunk of the population is pretty similar.  My playlists range from big band, to Janet Jackson, to some country, to Herb Albert and the Tijuana Brass, to Run DMC, to techno pop, to Celtic music, to random no-real-genre music.  \n\nOn the other hand, is it possible you have some sort of sense issues?  There are certain sounds that will drive me to within an inch of murder, and I just have to remove myself or use noise canceling/dampening assistance.\n\nExample: (and yes, it's totally irrational), I can't stand the sound of TV in the morning right when I wake up.  I don't know why, because radio or other music doesn't bother me at all.", "YTA, this is my and I'm sure every other person's playlist that they listen too and by that I mean a vast majority of song genres if you don't like it put earphones in or something if it makes her motivated and she likes it then don't take it away from her jeez.", "YTA.

Eclectic music taste that we had a big argument about last night. \n\nWe live together and have a great sound system in the shared areas of the house (kitchen, living room, dining room, etc) and when I play music, I usually put on an album or two to listen to, straight through. \n\nMy girlfriend likes to put on playlists, and last night she put on, in this order... I honestly just have to write out this playlist because it's that crazy. \n\nFriends in low places by Garth Brooks (a very country song) \n\nThen the theifing magipe by Rossini (an intense classical music song) \n\nThen pink rover by scene queen (a weird metal / pop mix) \n\nThen dangerous by Cascada (a 2000s pop song) \n\nThen Dogma by KMFDM (this metal / electronic song with spoken word lyrics) \n\nAfter that point, I asked her if she could just pick one playlist or album, or at least something more normal, and put it on because her music was kinda all over the place. \n\nShe said that she was playing a playlist she made, and that it was what she wanted to listen to when she was doing chores.\n\nI, kinda joking around, but also a little annoyed, asked what kinda playlist it was, because it seemed unhinged. \n\nShe was like \"uhh it's my cleaning playlist? It's just good music to get up and move around or dance to? Like high energy stuff, you know\" \n\nI was like \"there's girly pop, classical music, and industrial noise in there tho?\" And she was like \"yeah that's some of what I like?\" \n\nI asked her if she could put on something a little less chaotic and she said she was cleaning our kitchen, the least I could do is not talk shit about her music tastes. \n\nI was like \"but you've gotta realize it's a little out there, right?\" And she was like \"Nah these are all bangers, why are you being such a dick? I don't talk shit when you wanna listen to the same 3 bands everyday\" \n\nShe was getting really annoyed with me so I dropped it, and she played another hour or so of honestly the most random playlist I've ever heard\n\nI feel kinda conflicted, because on one hand her music was weird af and I feel like it's just common courtesy to play stuff that's at least kinda chill and could be background music in a shared space? Instead of like the most intense or weird song from every genre possible. \n\nBut on the other hand, I kinda got the impression she doesn't love my music either and just never said anything till I did. \n\nAITA for asking my girlfriend to put something more normal on?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Keep in mind I'm extreme when it comes to my music tastes.\n\nI have friends who respect my music tastes, and we both take turns listening to what we like, even if we don't enjoy it.

Sure, it's a shared space BUT she's cleaning. \ud83d\ude05", "YTA. I think it\u2019s odd if people play two or three albums/bands over and over, it shows a lack of musical maturity, a narrowness of taste. \n\nMost people responding here have very wide ranging music on their playlists.  I have everything from early Plan B to High School Musical, Vaughan Williams to Nirvana. \n\nYou are the unusual one here.", "I agree with you that playlists (especially those played where other people will hear them) should have some sort of flow to them and not be all over the place, however YTA in this situation. My general rule for stuff like this is \"No one has complained about when I play stuff so I'm not going to complain when other people play stuff\". I like most forms of rap (with trap being a top contender) and I like to play that music when I do chores. My roommate prefers country and doesn't seem to be a fan of most rap. He doesn't give me shit when I have my music on and I don't give him shit when he has his music on. Neither of us (and I suspect your gf as well) play the music for very long, just when we're doing chores. If you don't like it, just bite the bullet and keep doing your thing, it'll be over soon. This doesn't sound like a major issue between you two, but yea, YTA.", "Yup, YTA.  Gatekeeping music choices FFS.  Cut that out.  OP needs to get a set of noise cancelling earphones", "You need to take turns with the sound system. Blast your favorites when the other person isn\u2019t there.

And if it does take hours, you should be helping. And if you won\u2019t help, then she listens to what she wants. For however long it takes. \n\nYTA since she was doing chores AND you dissed her music. You didn\u2019t need to be rude about it.

More than a few of those artists have the same disparity in style as your girlfriend's music. And it's awesome! For me. And for many others too.\n\nAll of that mostly is to illustrate one point; it's ok for her preferences to be different from yours. You treating her like her preferences aren't valid is why YTA. She allows you your preferences while you listen to music, you should certainly allow her the same when she listens to hers.

The fact that your GF was cleaning but you chose to spend your time obessing over her music choices and writing down every track to critique her also sounds \"unhinged\".
