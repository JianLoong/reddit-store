What he was doing was illegal and dangerous, and could have caused a serious accident.  Plus the strange thing of repeatedly tickling you while he\u2019s driving?", "Nta, he could have killed you all.", "NTA.\n\nYou snitched to your mom? He's lucky you didn't snitch to the police.\n\nI wouldn't be getting into a car with him ever again, whether he has been drinking or not.

Willingly endangering his daughters and others is an asshole move. Your stepmom is enabling your dad and that\u2019s not healthy.", "NTA - Drunk drivers are bad humans. It's not hard to avoid alcohol when you know you are driving. Doing so before driving your children just compounds matters. Your dad is very much TA here.", "That is incredibly unsafe. You did the right thing NTA", "NTA you gotta make sure you stay safe.  Not much is too much.", "Dude decides to drive drunk and you're supposed to keep quiet?!\n\nNah, don't let that guy teach you how to enable dangerous behaviour.\n\nHonestly, I think your mom should report him.

Your dad should behave as a responsible adult and should accept his mistake. You did the right thing", "Woohoo so incredibly NTA. he could have killed you and your sister, an innocent passerby/ driver and himself.", "NTA\n\nDrunk driving is BAD.\n\nIt's a public safety issue, and a bigger safety issue for the people in the car. Basically, your dad endangered his own daughters, and isn't showing any remorse.", "I hope you told your mum about the touching too. It doesn't sound healthy or normal. \nNTA look after yourself", "NTA- he should not be driving drunk, especially with you and your sister in the car. Also, with looking at your comments, you should really tell your mom or another trusted adult that your dad is touching you in an inappropriate manner, because that seems really gross to me. You 100% did the right thing, best of luck to ya", "NTA - your mom should have called the police as soon as you texted her.       \nInstead calling your Dad", "NTA, your dad is being irresponsible and dangerous, this is unacceptable of him!", "Your mom should be livid. If my kids got into the car with a drunk driver I\u2019d be furious and nothing would calm me down. He could have KILLED you!!!\n\nNta", "thanks for the advice!", "yes, he is always touching me and rubbing my back or neck. it\u2019s so strange.", "Sounds like you were the only adult in the car.", "when i get home.  i\u2019m not able to go until he strictly gets his act together and IF we do go again my stepdad will be driving us.", "Yeah that\u2019s just creepy that he\u2019s doing that to a 15 year old girl especially his own daughter and when drunk no less\u2026", "You ever tell your mom this?", "Please check to see if you can text 911 in your area.  If you are able to provide details about where you are as well as the make and model and license plate of his car the police may be able to catch him driving drunk.", "You know, when you see a drunk driver on the road, you\u2019re actually not supposed to call the local police department. You\u2019re supposed to call 911. It\u2019s an immediate threat to other people\u2019s lives. \n\nNTA. There\u2019s a reason people end up in jail for this.", "NTA and never, ever get into a car with anyone who smells of alcohol again. Call 911 if he ever manages to get you in the car when you don't know he's drunk. Make sure you know your dad's license plate & what kind of car it is, and the color. The year, too, if possible. So you can rattle it off to the dispatcher without having to think about it much. Try to get your Mom to go for full custody, using his disregard for your safety, your sister's safety, and that of everyone on the road or near it that day. He may swear he loves you. He may even swear he won't drive drunk again. Don't believe him. His wife even tried to downplay it. No one who truly cares about you would put you in such danger.", "NTA. Drunk driving is a crime. Your father committed a crime of which you and your sister were nearly victims. Next time call 911 and report him. Tell him today you are going to do just that if you smell any alcohol or see anything like what you saw this time.", "NTA, you absolutely did the right thing by telling your mom and you did a wonderful job keeping a cool head so you wouldn't scare your sister. I'm not trying to sound cheesy when I say that you did a good job by keeping a level head in a tense situation and that you probably prevented it from getting worse. \n\nDefinitely tell your mom about the tickling thing and how you feel about it.", "\"Didnt even drink *that* much\"? That's their argument? Yeah Definitely NTA. I wouldnt step foot in a car with him again. If he's so ready and willing to put his life and you and your sister's on the line by drinking he doesnt need to be driving, let alone be around kids. You did exactly what your supposed to do, tell a trusted adult.", "Holy shit NTA that sounds really scary.", "Holy macaroni NTA. He was drunk driving. That\u2019s something you definitely don\u2019t stay quiet about. He could have killed you, your sister, and anyone else out on the roads.", "NTA. You did exactly what you should have done, told someone. You were fortunate that he didn't get into a wreck. There is no excuse for any amount of drinking then driving your kids. Your Dad and Stepmom are total AHs!!", "NTAH- your father is for driving drunk - and for endangering your lives and the lives of every other person he encountered. \nHe may be an adult- but he\u2019s an irresponsible one. \nIf you suspect or smell alcohol or drugs on anyone operating a vehicle- refuse to get in the vehicle and contact a responsible adult to pick you up.", "NTA. Drunk driving kills. You are lucky you weren\u2019t hurt", "It's a public safety issue, and a bigger safety issue for the people in the car.", "You should read this story: [Teen passenger calls 911 on mother as she's drunk driving](https://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/national/article251764908.html)\n\nNTA. In the future, you need to call 911. Take a photo of the plates. Your dad and step dismissed his drunk driving as he only having drank a little bit. This means this has, **and will** happen again. Lives are literally at stake, and if he can't give consideration to your and your sisters lives, you **do not** want to get in a car with him.", "This is very very not normal, and you should tell your mom about this.", "It\u2019s normal to do that, it\u2019s apapropite when you were little but you are years into puberty fully developed sexually it is not cute little playing teasing to make you laugh like it was when you were five \u2026it is a creepy drunk man making an excuse to touch you only made worse that it\u2019s your dad", "If my kids got into the car with a drunk driver I\u2019d be furious and nothing would calm me down."]}
