Plus the strange thing of repeatedly tickling you while he\u2019s driving?", "Nta, he could have killed you all.", "NTA.\n\nYou snitched to your mom? He's lucky you didn't snitch to the police.\n\nI wouldn't be getting into a car with him ever again, whether he has been drinking or not. He has little regard for the safety of his own children, let alone other road users.\n\nYou and your mom need to figure out some other way of getting you and your sister safely to his house and back - that is, if you continue to go at all.", "NTA- Your dad needs to reevaluate his life tho. Willingly endangering his daughters and others is an asshole move. Your stepmom is enabling your dad and that\u2019s not healthy.", "NTA - Drunk drivers are bad humans. It's not hard to avoid alcohol when you know you are driving. Doing so before driving your children just compounds matters. Your dad is very much TA here.", "That is incredibly unsafe. You did the right thing NTA", "NTA you gotta make sure you stay safe.  Not much is too much.", "Dude decides to drive drunk and you're supposed to keep quiet?!\n\nNah, don't let that guy teach you how to enable dangerous behaviour.\n\nHonestly, I think your mom should report him.
