I live in the UK in a private estate. That means that the shared spaces within the estate are maintained and paid for by the people who live there, by means of an annual charge, instead of the council.\n\nAt the most recent AGM it was suggested that the annual payment needed to go up by \u00a3150 per property to pay for repairs to the small park within the estate. This is because a group of children (I would guess between the ages of 5 and 9) who frequently use it have deliberately been vandalising it over the past year or so, pulling trees, plants apart, digging up the decorative wood work and bashing ti against the fencing, also damaging that etc. My house overlooks the park so I see this happening frequently and recognise all of the children responsible. \n\nI put my hand up and suggested the parents of those responsible for vandalising the park should split the cost between them as its not fair for everyone to have to pay for deliberate vandalism. A few of the parents were in attendance at the AGM and unsurprisingly opposed this idea and said that there was no way to know who had done it, the management company also initially supported this view as they were of the understanding no one knew who had done the damage and when. I then advised that I had been witnessing the vandalism myself over the course of the past 18 months, and not only that but I also had photos and videos I had taken of the vandalism being done and also the property numbers of where the children lived. I had gathered this evidence in anticipation of one day being expected to foot the bill myself.\n\nThe management company have now asked me to submit to them all the evidence I have for review and the plan to discuss with the parents of the children involved (not all of them were at the AGM). Afterwards the parents who were in attendance came up and had a go at me. The main things they said were that it was illegal for me to have taken photos of their children (I don't believe this is correct, they were in a public space), and also that if I saw them doing the vandalism I should have stopped them or said something. I don't like confrontation, even with children who I am generally uncomfortable around, so told the parents it was there job to know what their children were up to and discipline them, not mine, and I hadn't done anything wrong by taking evidence of the vandalism in case it was ever needed. They called me an asshole and walked off.\n\nWas I the asshole here? Was it wrong of me to gather the evidence? Should I have just confronted the children instead? Confronted the parents? I feel like I dealt with the situation the way I was the most comfortable doing and to protect myself and other residence from having to pay for other childrens vandalism, but my experience at the AGM now has me doubting that.", "created_utc": 1669469867, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z57rok/aita_for_suggesting_the_parents_of_children_who/", "score": 160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After all, if the neighbors affected most could have stopped the vandalism at any time for a year and half but were okay with it continuing, why should anyone pay for it to stop now?\n\nNTA for your actual question, but I think waiting this long, and allowing multiple cases of damage to occur when you could have stopped it by submitting things earlier, has dug yourself a bit of a hole.", "NTA\n\nThey are mad their spawn got caught and they have to pay now.", "NTA.
