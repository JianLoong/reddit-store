I live in the UK in a private estate. That means that the shared spaces within the estate are maintained and paid for by the people who live there, by means of an annual charge, instead of the council.\n\nAt the most recent AGM it was suggested that the annual payment needed to go up by \u00a3150 per property to pay for repairs to the small park within the estate. This is because a group of children (I would guess between the ages of 5 and 9) who frequently use it have deliberately been vandalising it over the past year or so, pulling trees, plants apart, digging up the decorative wood work and bashing ti against the fencing, also damaging that etc. My house overlooks the park so I see this happening frequently and recognise all of the children responsible. \n\nI put my hand up and suggested the parents of those responsible for vandalising the park should split the cost between them as its not fair for everyone to have to pay for deliberate vandalism. A few of the parents were in attendance at the AGM and unsurprisingly opposed this idea and said that there was no way to know who had done it, the management company also initially supported this view as they were of the understanding no one knew who had done the damage and when. I then advised that I had been witnessing the vandalism myself over the course of the past 18 months, and not only that but I also had photos and videos I had taken of the vandalism being done and also the property numbers of where the children lived. I had gathered this evidence in anticipation of one day being expected to foot the bill myself.\n\nThe management company have now asked me to submit to them all the evidence I have for review and the plan to discuss with the parents of the children involved (not all of them were at the AGM). Afterwards the parents who were in attendance came up and had a go at me. The main things they said were that it was illegal for me to have taken photos of their children (I don't believe this is correct, they were in a public space), and also that if I saw them doing the vandalism I should have stopped them or said something. I don't like confrontation, even with children who I am generally uncomfortable around, so told the parents it was there job to know what their children were up to and discipline them, not mine, and I hadn't done anything wrong by taking evidence of the vandalism in case it was ever needed. They called me an asshole and walked off.\n\nWas I the asshole here? Was it wrong of me to gather the evidence? Should I have just confronted the children instead? Confronted the parents? I feel like I dealt with the situation the way I was the most comfortable doing and to protect myself and other residence from having to pay for other childrens vandalism, but my experience at the AGM now has me doubting that.", "created_utc": 1669469867, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z57rok/aita_for_suggesting_the_parents_of_children_who/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They're just mad their kids got caught and they might have to pay for the damages. The only AH's here are the kids  and their crappy parents.", "NTA\n\nIf the parents were actually watching the kids, you wouldn't have had to gather evidence. Their failure to parent doesn't mean everyone else gets a bill.", "NTA \n\nIt is not up to you to parent someone's kids. It is up to the parent's. That's why some kids will vandalize the park and some won't. \n\nNot sure about the pictures, I think it depends on your state/country but I think in public space it is not illegal. Since your house overlooks the park, even if you had a security camera you would have footage of who did it. That is not illegal.", "NTA, but collecting evidence for a year and a half but waiting so long to do anything with it seems like a strange choice on your part. Providing your evidence to management earlier could have averted the issue much sooner, and saved everyone time, money, and hassle.", "NTA You have video and photographic evidence of who was involved. Their parents paying the fees is the ONLY fair way for this situation to be dealt with. And those parents need to deal with their children appropriately to prevent this from happening again (especially if they don't want to have to keep paying for those extra fees!)\n\nBe sure you keep an eye (and camera) out on your property. I don't trust those kids (and parents) and would hate for them to retaliate by damaging your property.", "You should have done something far sooner than this. Why not submit your videos to the council after the first instance of major property damage? That would have allowed them to deal with things before they escalated further.\n\nSubmitting now allows the parents to argue they didn\u2019t know, they didn\u2019t have a chance to rectify things before the damage was severe, etc. And once their argument about generally taking photos in public spaces doesn\u2019t hold water they are going to attack why you held on to the evidence for 18 months.\n\nIf you\u2019ve know what was happening this long, yet did nothing to change the situation, then the issue to you wasn\u2019t the damage - it was being asked to contribute more money. Why should these parents pay to fix something that nobody cared was broken? A faulty argument, but one that can be used. After all, if the neighbors affected most could have stopped the vandalism at any time for a year and half but were okay with it continuing, why should anyone pay for it to stop now?\n\nNTA for your actual question, but I think waiting this long, and allowing multiple cases of damage to occur when you could have stopped it by submitting things earlier, has dug yourself a bit of a hole.", "NTA\n\nThey are mad their spawn got caught and they have to pay now.", "NTA. Isn\u2019t it funny the right parents came to you? Almost, if they knew their childs did it\u2026", "Soft AH for letting it go on for 18 months without confrontation. If the plan fails and the parents don't step up you cost yourself and everyone else money by continuing to let the vandalism happen. You should have turned the evidence into the management company the first time you collected it and had them confront the parents if you didn't want to. You aren't wrong for collecting evidence. Probably good that you didn't confront the kids. Not wrong for suggesting parents pay. But you were in the wrong for not at least reporting it to the management company sooner.", "NTA for the suggestion of them paying.  YTA for letting it go on for 18 months and calling them out in a public forum.  Since you supposedly don't like confrontation you should've contacted the AGM earlier with all your evidence.  The AGM could've handled it privately, and if they didn't that's when you bring it up publicly at the meeting.", "If you witnessed the vandalism for 18 months and didn't say anything, then yes,  you're TA.", "Eh...technically NTA, but it was A-holish of you not to contact the management company as soon as you had enough evidence to identify the vandals. You could have put a stop to this problem earlier and perhaps even reduced the damage to the property that you co-own.", "You aren't good with confrontation, but had all this evidence piled up and then called a bunch of parents out in person at a meeting? You're telling me it's easier for you to do that, then to make a phone call about some kids being assholes?", "NTA. Sounds like you did a great job thinking ahead to collect the evidence.", "NTA --- Wanna bet that some of these parents knew what their kids were up to and the only reason they confronted OP was that they have now been caught out and if OP hadn't said anything they would have kept their mouths shut and said nothing about it being their kids.", "NTA for taking the pictures, but you definitely should have given them to the management company right away, and each time it happened. How would you feel if one of your neighbors saw someone damage your property or steal something from it (and they knew who did it and had the evidence to prove it) but they never called the police? Then a year and a half later, you find out they knew the whole time?", "NTA For holding the parents responsible, but you should have turned the evidence in earlier so the property management company could have cited the responsible parties and prevented additional damage.", "YTA\n\nYou were secretly and potentially illegally filming children for 18 months. A few days to get evidence and do something about it would be understandable but 18 months? Why didn't you report it to the management committee if you didn't feel comfortable going to the kids or their parents? Or go to the police like the community police? \n\nI think it's also kinda assholish that you didn't try to do anything to stop it, you just didn't want to be left with the bill.", "NTA.\n\nYou can tell with this kind of parent that had you tried to say something to their kids, they would have freaked out about you parenting their children. \n\nWould it have been a nice thing to maybe tell the parents in advance once you realized their kids were destroying things? Yes. But from this conversation it looks like they knew their children were involved and just didn\u2019t do anything about it, so again, not your problem.", "For wanting parents to be responsible for the damage their kids caused, N T A. For this conflict, ESH. \n\nYou squirreled away pictures of children for over a year and thought that *wouldn't* be brought up as an issue? It isn't public property. It's private land with an expectation of privacy. It's going to be tough to get management to side with you now.\n\nYou honestly should have reported it sooner to management. Waiting over a year is ridiculous. It would have saved on damages and cost of repairs. It would have addressed the real problem. Now it's just turning into \"This creep has been taking pics of our kids for a year\" instead of \"who should be liable for this.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If the parents cornered you then they must\u2019ve known what their children were doing. Why didn\u2019t they put an end to it themselves?", "NTA. \n\nI do understand why they were mad.   Even if it isn't illegal to take pictures of those kids, most parents still aren't going to like that you did it.  If this was like a ring camera and you just happened to capture it, that would be one thing.  But this sounds like you sat in your window and took pictures.  Usually not going to go over well. \n\nSimilarly, even if you didn't want to confront the kids (understandable), I do feel like you probably should have raised it to the parents at some point since you knew who was doing it. \n\nEven with all that, the fact is, the parents are trying to pawn off the costs of their kids shitty behavior to everyone else, so that makes them wrong, even if they don't like how you went about it.  It also wouldn't surprise me that they chose to first deny it until you said you have proof.  That is classic deflection.  First deny, then when given proof, attack the way the proof was obtained.  \n\nPoint is, their kids vandalized stuff, and they should pay.", "The problem is it isn't public space. It's privately owned land. Quick search of UK law says that OP would have needed the permission of the owner of the land prior to taking the pictures.", "ESH.  Let's also note that the parents knew their kids were doing it.  OP says he had pics and house numbers, not that he read them off at the meeting.  Anyone coming to him afterwards upset about the pics, had to know their kids were vandalizing... and did nothing to stop it.  OP is an AH for not sending info to board sooner.  Why wait 18 months to report?  He only said something when it would cost him money.  He should have reported them the first time.", "Don't care how long it's gone on.

AGM just stands for Annual General Meeting", "Honestly, even if I don't agree, I get it. \n\nIts often easier to raise these issues in a public forum for many people, as opposed to one on one.  Less chance of an incident if everyone sees it.  Its similar to why some people like to break up with people in public and not private, in hopes that the other person won't lose their shit.", "I think OP is a co-owner like all the tenants.", "If they were taking pictures as evidence of a crime, is that not allowed? Like regardless of whether it was public or private space", "Still NTA because as soon as the vandalism had happened the board should have been in contact with the residents to find out what was going on.", "While not in my country, I am going to assume there is a way to report things prior to the meeting. I'm not saying the kids and the parents aren't the major AH in this situation, but the OP asked if he had done it right and I believe by not taking initiative to report the behavior and instead waiting to give the info publicly in the meeting he was a bit of an AH. Not a huge one. Maybe just more in the wrong then AH but he didn't react appropriately.", "Yes. I have no idea what AGM means so I assumed it is some sort of community management, kind of like homeowners associations (HOA) in America.", "It reads like an HOA living situation.

I know countries were filming (like IG stories) is legal but if I see you filming towards my direction I can call the police and demand that to be taken down due to privacy laws (you post my exact location online without my permission) \n\nIt's a bunch of parents vs management company thought not just OP.", "Guaranteed to be a shitshow at this point."]}
