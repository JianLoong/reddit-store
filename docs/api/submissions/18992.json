They finally show up ay 3:15 & I ask if the appointment is still at 3. Which they say yes and it\u2019s fine if we are late. I then ask next time if they could send a text saying they are running late so I\u2019m not outside waiting. They precede to blow up on me and say it\u2019s not a big deal they were running late. As they are screaming at me they are driving in circles and not towards the nail place. Finally they park in my apartment parking lot & tell me to get out of the car, which I refuse because I don\u2019t understand why they are so upset. They then roll down the window of the car & grab my bag from the passenger seat with my laptop in on & throw it out the window. I get out of the car to get my bag (and now broken laptop) and they drive off laughing.

It\u2019s reasonable to politely ask someone to text you so you\u2019re not just standing around for half an hour. Your friend has zero emotional regulation. That response was completely inappropriate and she definitely should pay for a new laptop. Hell, file charges if you have to \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA.  Get new friends.", "NTA and I'd rethink being friends with them. They have no respect for your time or your property, and if they'd be willing to destroy a laptop for something that small, who knows how they're willing to harm you for something big.", "NTA. Get a new friend and take them to small claims court.", "ESH \n\nYour \u2018friend\u2019 is a horrible excuse for a person but you shouldn\u2019t have refused to get out of their vehicle. \n\nDrop the friend and take them to small claims court for the broken laptop.", "ESH. \n\nThey are very inconsiderate, and don\u2019t seem to understand the concept of appointments. \nYou don\u2019t get to refuse to get out of their vehicle.", "NTA. It\u2019s dumb to even ask cause we both know you\u2019re in the right. That \u2018friend\u2019 of yours has the audacity to scream at you for what they did, be it an accident or not. I imagine them to start screaming \u201cOH MY GOD YOURE STUPID IM STUPID I HAVE TO GET MY NAILS DONE BECAUSE THEY LOOK SO UGLY I LOOK UGLY IM SO JEALOUS YOUR NAILS ALREADY LOOK AMAZING\u201d or smth. There\u2019s this super cool thing called harassment, you little ***** of a friend. Ever heard of it? Her dumb *** can go to jail for that computer now lmao. Now go get new friends.

What you can control is not going outside until they text you that they have arrived.  Saying you what you said just comes off as whiny and complaining.\n\n2.  Obviously, they overreacted by copping an attitude, and deciding not to go to the appointment.\n\n3.  You had no right to stay in the car when they wanted you to leave. It\u2019s their property.\n\n4.  Destroying your laptop was an obvious overreaction and you can probably take them to small claims court.", "NTA, that's just a courteous thing to do, to let someone know when they're running late.\n\nThis person is clearly not your friend.", "NTA. Basic communication when running late is MINIMAL. Being on time is better.

Go and report them for this or go to a small claim courts, idk which one is more appropriate. It's important to immediately screenshot that convo, so you have evidence of clear admission.\n\nAnd well, as others said, maybe a restraining order!\n\nNTA for sure.", "ESH.\n\nThey're in the wrong for being late and you're in the wrong for refusing to get out of their car when they've told you to. You stayed in their vehicle against their wishes. You don't get to assert your dominance in THEIR car just because you 'don't understand why they're upset.' That is their car, and if they tell you to get out then you get out.\n\nBut having said that, they're clearly in the wrong for being late.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also screenshot the text in which they admit to throwing the laptop.", "NTA. It takes nothing for them to send you a polite text. The only spot where I'd say you messed up was you should have gotten out of the car when they demanded it... but even then, that doesn't justify them breaking your stuff.\n\nYou may need to take this person to small claims court over the laptop, though. There's not much chance they'll pay you back for that of their own free will.", "NTA... not a friend. Small claims court? Try to get proof on your messages.", "NTA\n\n1. Running late and not telling the person waiting on you is the asshole move\n2. Why are you friends with them?\n3. Why are you friends with them again?", "YTA\n\nYou're in her car, and she had every right to tell you to get out even if she's the crazy one. She even drove you back to your apartment. What else do you want? Just get out of the car and block her everywhere. \n\nWhy did you stay in the car? What's your end game? You still want to go get your nails done with someone who left you waiting outside for half an hour, yelled and screamed at you when confronted? \n\nMaybe you're grown up with people screaming and yelling at you, so you thought it's normal... but this is not normal. Angry and out of control people often led to violence. Learn to protect yourself.", "And a restraining order. This is nuts.", "OP has the right to trespass in the person\u2019s car?", "No one else seems to understand that. Also, she should not have even brought up the late arrival.

XD Have a nice day you silly goose.", "That\u2019s not how that works. You made a claim, and I challenged you to support the claim. You can\u2019t and do you\u2019re deflecting. \n\nNow you\u2019re calling me names. You clearly have nothing intelligent to offer, so I\u2019m moving on. Tootles!"]}
