It\u2019s reasonable to politely ask someone to text you so you\u2019re not just standing around for half an hour. Your friend has zero emotional regulation.

They have no respect for your time or your property, and if they'd be willing to destroy a laptop for something that small, who knows how they're willing to harm you for something big.", "NTA. Get a new friend and take them to small claims court.", "ESH \n\nYour \u2018friend\u2019 is a horrible excuse for a person but you shouldn\u2019t have refused to get out of their vehicle. \n\nDrop the friend and take them to small claims court for the broken laptop.", "ESH. \n\nThey are very inconsiderate, and don\u2019t seem to understand the concept of appointments. \nYou don\u2019t get to refuse to get out of their vehicle.", "NTA. It\u2019s dumb to even ask cause we both know you\u2019re in the right. That \u2018friend\u2019 of yours has the audacity to scream at you for what they did, be it an accident or not. I imagine them to start screaming \u201cOH MY GOD YOURE STUPID IM STUPID I HAVE TO GET MY NAILS DONE BECAUSE THEY LOOK SO UGLY I LOOK UGLY IM SO JEALOUS YOUR NAILS ALREADY LOOK AMAZING\u201d or smth. There\u2019s this super cool thing called harassment, you little ***** of a friend. Ever heard of it? Her dumb *** can go to jail for that computer now lmao. Now go get new friends. We\u2019re on your side.", "ESH. \n1.  Next time, worry about what you can control. You can\u2019t control someone being late.

Obviously, they overreacted by copping an attitude, and deciding not to go to the appointment.\n\n3.  You had no right to stay in the car when they wanted you to leave.

Also screenshot the text in which they admit to throwing the laptop.", "NTA. It takes nothing for them to send you a polite text. The only spot where I'd say you messed up was you should have gotten out of the car when they demanded it... but even then, that doesn't justify them breaking your stuff.\n\nYou may need to take this person to small claims court over the laptop, though. There's not much chance they'll pay you back for that of their own free will.", "NTA... not a friend. Small claims court? Try to get proof on your messages.", "NTA\n\n1. Running late and not telling the person waiting on you is the asshole move\n2. Why are you friends with them?\n3. Why are you friends with them again?", "YTA\n\nYou're in her car, and she had every right to tell you to get out even if she's the crazy one. She even drove you back to your apartment. What else do you want? Just get out of the car and block her everywhere. \n\nWhy did you stay in the car? What's your end game? You still want to go get your nails done with someone who left you waiting outside for half an hour, yelled and screamed at you when confronted? \n\nMaybe you're grown up with people screaming and yelling at you, so you thought it's normal... but this is not normal. Angry and out of control people often led to violence. Learn to protect yourself.", "And a restraining order. This is nuts.", "OP has the right to trespass in the person\u2019s car?", "No one else seems to understand that. Also, she should not have even brought up the late arrival. Next time, she could\u2019ve just waited in the house until the friend showed up.", "So setting a communication standard is whiny and complaining? God I would hate to know you", "How were they trespassing?", "I know, right?\n\nAlso, I'm 50/50 sure this is said \"friend\", since they're so keen on defending the whole ordeal.\n\nThat, or they're as shitty, and totally an unreasonable, unhinged excuse of a human being for trying to justify destruction of property.", "They refused to get out of the car after being told to get out.\n\nEdit:  how is this getting down voted when this is literally the definition of trespassing?\n\nOh yeah, Reddit peeps are emotional\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "You're defending deliberate destruction of property but claiming others are emotional, this is hilarious.", "It\u2019ll be even funnier if you can show me where I defended deliberate destruction of property.", "If you can tell me all the fallacies you're committing first, that way I can just point at that list. XD Have a nice day you silly goose.", "That\u2019s not how that works. You made a claim, and I challenged you to support the claim. You can\u2019t and do you\u2019re deflecting. \n\nNow you\u2019re calling me names. You clearly have nothing intelligent to offer, so I\u2019m moving on. Tootles!", "NTA. Sounds like this person might be on drugs \nFile a police report for damaged laptop", "Something is very wrong with that \u201cfriend\u201d. File a police report, take them to small claims court and block them. NTA", "You call this a friend?  Get new ones - the entire thing sounds like a scam to embarrass you and make you look like a fool.  NTA.  But you will probably have to go to small claims court to get reimbursed for the laptop.", "NTA to expect common courtesy", "NTA, first of all they just sound psycho, second of all I would file a police report immediately as you'll need a case against them if you want to sue for damages. Third it's simply common courtesy to tell someone that they're running late, and finally they aren't your friend anymore. Friends don't do what the person in this example did, and with how they acted I would consider a restraining order too.", "Of course nta", "NTA.\nSome people do not have manners. You will likely never teach them manners by asking politely. Your friend asking you to get out of the car and throwing your bag out is extremely rude and uncalled for based on your account. Perhaps they have a mental health issue. Regardless, it seems that you are not safe around this person so the next time they want to hang out, better to avoid them.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not a big dead for someone who doesn\u2019t respect others\u2019 time and workload \n\nMy sister used to do that we me and our hair appointments. She also drove like a maniac to try to make up the time which was terrifying \n\nI stopped going with her and got a closer stylist", "Lol are you joking? This can't be real.", "R u sure this is your friend?  You really need to get real friends.", "Sounds like they did send a text saying running late tho lol not the asshole your friend sounds toxic tho. Stay away from them.", "No way this is real", "ESH: You should have gotten out of the car but for your own sake, I\u2019d get out of their lives. Friends don\u2019t treat each other that way.", "ESH. Someone tells you to get out, you get out", "NTA.", "NTA and I just want to say thank you for being one of the good doobies that feel manners still matter. People are either never learning them or losing them rapidly these days.", "NTA. This person is not your friend. Sue for your replacement laptop", "Is this a joke? What about that interaction leads you to believe YOU are TA.", "NTA get new friends.", "NTA - Run from this friendship. Sorry but if someone threw a temper tantrum about being called out for being late, I'd be sitting in the car in shock for a hot minute. That's not trespassing. And throwing your bag out as a response is downright toddler level childish. Really lose this person's number, block them on everything, only engage when absolutely necessary, dealing with them is not worth the damage to your mental health.", "So NTA for the most part. Asking for notification is fine as you need to know that. Only part you sucked at was when they told you to het out and didnt. They are still wrong for throwing your stuff out but when told to get out of their car you should have gotten out. I know others have said police report and small claims but i would say not to bother cause your hopefully exfriend will argue they wanted you out of their vehicle and didnt want to be accused of stealing your property plus you wouldnt get out after she made it clear you werent welcome. You wouldnt get in trouble necessarily but may be a waste of time depending on jusges in your area. Drop that person from your life and going forward if people dont want you in their vehicle, dont argue. Just get out.", "NTA\n\nPlease block and delete their details on everything because they aren't a friend and probably never were.", "Police report for laptop will come in handy in small claims court. Because this friendship is over, or should be", "see i feel like refusing to get out of the car was more stupid than assholish. like if i was in this situation i might have refused because i would be trying to talk to the friend and figure exactly what was going on, and that\u2019s what OP\u2019s actions seemed to be.", "Bro they were just trying to talk it out and try and make things better", "Sounds like they weren\u2019t necessarily refusing but just being like \u201cwhat\u2019s going on? Can we talk this out?\u201d", "They were literally just trying to talk things out and fix things", "No im not joking. it happened yesterday", "I agree, this is a bs story.", "\u201cTrespassing\u201d does not mean it\u2019s perfectly legal to destroy someone else\u2019s property. You clearly don\u2019t know the law if you\u2019re defending a blatant crime over something iffy", "*the friend has entered the chat*", "I feel like the details on that part would help- like there is a significant difference between \"what do you mean get out? Can we talk about this?\" and some sort of screaming match, or extended refusal.", "Um yeah, she definitely should have brought up that her idiot friend was *30 minutes late*. It\u2019s rude as fuck to keep someone waiting that long.", "You have no idea how friendships work bc you obviously have none", "Were you, by any chance, also born yesterday?", "And you immediate response to a point you don\u2019t agree with this to lash out and attack the person making the statement? I would hate it even more if you knew me.\n\nThe person picking you up, is doing you a favor. It\u2019s never a good approach to call them out for their negligence and add a guilt trip on top of it, which is exactly what the OP did. And in this case, OP had an easy workaround.  \n\nI have a very difficult time believing you would be calm and diplomatic to the OP, as you have a evinced none of those qualities here on an anonymous message board.", "Honestly, though. Profile is an hour fresher than the post.", "Thanks for introducing yourself :)\n\nSo, why did you freak out the way you did? \n\nAnd then smashing the OP\u2019s computer on top of that?  You probably need therapy.", "The correct thing to do is immediately comply, and if your emotions are still in control, attempt to reason with them. Although, someone who would go to such a nuclear option is not likely to be in a reasoning mood. \n\nBut their car. No matter how much of an asshole they are, you have to get out.  It would be wise to keep this in mind if you are ever asked to leave a private business.", "The friend knew she was 30 min late.  What was the point of bringing it up in that moment?", "Your characterization of me as a person has nothing to do with the topic. Try again.", "Is every single person on Reddit emotional except you? Are you somehow immune to this Reddit emotional syndrome everybody else seems to be suffering from..?", "Funny that you took the time to look up my details, but didn\u2019t bother reading any of my other comments. If you did, you would realize that very early on, I gave an ESH ruling, and also suggested that the OP take the friend to court. Gotta love Reddit lol.", "Because it\u2019s insanely rude and it needs to be called out. Let me guess- you keep people waiting a lot, right?", "No, I saw at least one other reasonable comment understanding that you cannot remain in someone\u2019s car after they have told you to leave. Other than that, I think your assessment is fairly accurate.  It\u2019s an indisputable fact that if you remain in someone\u2019s car after being told to leave, that is a crime of trespassing.\n\nBut I get it, once someone is deemed the AH, it doesn\u2019t matter what the other person has done. Both parties sucked in this case.", "I didn\u2019t make an assessment. I asked two questions lol. Also, this is AITA, not r/legaladvice. The question isn\u2019t whether OP is lawful in what they\u2019re doing, it\u2019s whether they\u2019re being an ah or not. You\u2019ve landed yourself in the wrong subreddit and just keep going on about the law.", "It was a rhetorical question, which is the same as an assessment. You were making an argument. \n\nI thought the law was an easy reference;  it I guess not lol.  \n\nYes, the OP is an asshole for refusing to get out of the car when ordered to.", "Are you the friend mad that someone\u2019s holding you accountable for being annoying and now you\u2019re trying to find any desperate attempt to defend yourself or something?\n\nBc just drop the person off at the spot, stop driving in circles if you don\u2019t want to be around them, don\u2019t throw their shit out your window during your temper tantrum.\n\nActually just don\u2019t be late in the first place and then you won\u2019t have to have a temper tantrum in the first place"]}
