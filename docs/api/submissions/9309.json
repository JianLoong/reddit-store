The good news, there was no drama. I warned the agent about what happened and my wife filled her in on the family backstory. She was very understanding. FIL did not bring step-MIL, but did bring up the \"cousin\" thing ...... as expected, he waited until I was not in the room. He seemed convinced he had met her at a family gathering before (lol!), and she even played along.\n\nIt turned out for the best, because there was no drama. I did not get put in a position of being a liar myself or letting the cat out of the bag on my wife, and there were no hurt feelings on the other side either. That's not to say this won't come up again down the road. My wife is actually more resolved now to rip the band-aid off.", "created_utc": 1675706943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vdien/update_aita_for_refusing_to_lie_for_my_wife/", "score": 352, "replies": ["Why is your wife's family at the inspection anyway?", "NTA, but your wife needs her own backbone.  She should have told her father that you were not using her stepsister.  End of story.  Her father's reaction is irrelevant.", "Glad to hear it!!", "NTA. And neither is your wife. Your inlaws on the other hand.....", "Heh, I love it when a plan comes together.", "Her dad has been a builder his whole life, so his input has a lot of weight.  Step-MIL usually hovers nearby.", "Agreed. It's time to set some really firm boundaries.", "Your FIL and Step MIL sound a LOT like my FIL and Step MIL. I feel for your wife and you. \nGlad things worked out for you both.", "I see. TBH this is probably going to be an unpopular opinion but I think ESH. Sure, you didn't verbally lie to your FIL, but your wife did, and you're aware your FIL thinks this woman is your cousin and you haven't done anything to clear that up. And then both of you put the agent in the position to lie to him, and she did in fact carry on with this nonsense story. But since you weren't in the room, you think it's okay? The lack of honesty from both you and your wife to not rock the boat with her family has now put 3 of you in a lie. Next time just tell the truth, it's going to come out anyway.", "Well, as you now know, free services aren\u2019t really free.", "If it all worked then you should definitely be happy he was there. My dad was a carpenter and owned a construction company for almost 30 years until he retired and passed it to my sibling. He taught me a lot, but I would never buy anything without having him also check it out. The inspectors you get from real estate companies aren't always as diligent or knowledgable and often won't spot the same potential issues as someone who's built/worked on thousands of homes.", "You won the battle but you're going to lose the war if you are constantly appeasing this man and even breaking your own principles to deal with his BS."]}
