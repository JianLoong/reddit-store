Although they were \"vocal\" that they love us both and there were no favorites. I beg to disagree but I understand and don't really give an f growing up.\n\nOn holidays, my brother would get a new gaming console while I only get a book, or we would get the same phones but he would get an extra money so he could date his gf. When I graduated college, they gave me a car, and I am so happy until a few days later when they also gave my brother a car because they say \"to be fair\" to both of us. When he graduated college he was given an international trip as a gift. Then, I didn't bat an eye but I am keeping score.\n\nIt does not stop there, when he moved out, they gave him a place as a gift because he \"would have a family and they will live there\", and I had to rent an apartment on my own because they say \"when I marry, my husband will provide me a house.\"\n\nFast forward to this new year, my brother arrived earlier than me with his girlfriend that my parents has just met. I believe they have already bonded while I wasn't there because when I arrived, they seem to be close already.\n\nDuring the dinner, when my parents were giving gifts to both of us, as this is our new year's tradition. My brother was given his gift first, he opened it and it was a brand new latest model phone. When he opened the box, his girlfriend said \"wow that's the color I liked\". I think this was heard by my parents, because instead of giving me my gift, they gave her the gift and said to me \"she'll appreciate it more than you and you are more than capable to buy yourself one\". I thought the gf will not accept it because it was mine and had my name on it but she instead opened it and looked really happy. This made me really upset that I walked out in the middle of dinner and I went home.\n\nMy family was bombarding me with messages saying how rude I am and that I do not respect them and that I should apologize to them all. Aita?\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that I also received several messages from our extended family about apologizing to my parents and brother for being rude. They emphasis our culture of \"close family ties\", and that these are just \"gifts\". Apparently, it should be okay because my parents brought me up well, they paid for my school, and I never had any \"difficulties\" growing up. And that my parents are not \"perfect\". \n\n\nUpdate: Spoke with my dad today because he went to my house. Well I more of just cried and listened. He apologizes for \"that\" thing that happened on dinner and if I ever felt unfavored \"sometimes\" is because I am a woman and my future husband (I only have a Bf) will be there to take care of me - like provide for our house etc. Whilst my brother has no one to look out for him so they do. He told me that my brother will be the one to provide a shelter for his future family and so on so they support him extra. Didn't really understand much of what he said but his main point is that I should still apologize to my mom and brother. WTF!!! I just asked him politely that he go home so I can think abt it.", "created_utc": 1704467770, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18z977m/aita_for_leaving_my_parents_house_on_new_years_eve/", "score": 252, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Gifts are a sign of affection, consideration and caring about a person. For your parents to take away your gift and give it to a new GF is horrible.\n\nI would have also left. They showed you just how little they value you. Yes, they did things for you... as any normal parent does. Yet, a normal parent doesn't present a gift, then take it away *in front of you*!\n\nYour extended family are ridiculous and/or getting a false story from your parents.\n\nI am so sorry this was your experience. I had a terrible MIL who passed away. I kept notes to make sure that I *never* act to an in-law the way she treated me.", "NTA - And the fact your parents and brother roped in the rest of your family who were not there to bombard you tells me that they care most about how they are viewed by others than how you view them.  They made sure to get their version of the story out before you could tell anyone your version so they painted themselves in the best light. \n\nUnfortunately it is unlikely they will change unless you are in a position to force the change.   I assume they aren't financially supporting you,  if that is the case,  block contact with them for 3-6 months, when you make contact again do it on your terms without the expectation of gifts and share WHY you broke contact.  How they make you feel time and again,  and see if they want to mend bridges.", "Cut them off ASAP.", "NTA\n\nDon't fold.  Now is the time to draw the proverbial line in the sand and let them know that thier complete lack of respect for you is no longer acceptable. The only assholes that are involved in this are your family.  In fact, find a new tradition to celebrate the holidays with because this kind of bs isn't worth your hurt feelings/emotional wellbeing.", "NTA\n\nWhat are these families where all extended family knows about internal immediate family disagreements and then decides to berate one member of the family?\n\nIs this a real thing? Is this isolated to certain areas of the world? Is my family the one family that doesn't do this?", "NTA. To give your gift to your brothers girlfriend I  front of you and say buy your own is incredibly rude. Go no contact", "Nta", "NTA\n\nThe misogyny and favouritism is blatantly clear.

They are never going to learn, so cut them all out and block their numbers, and anyone else who tries to guilt you.", "I don't think it's Golden Child-sim, per se.  The brother is The Boy in the family.  I doubt OP ever stood a chance.", "My parents are generous gifters. They give gifts for all occasions not only to us but to their friends and extended family.", "I don't think it's weird. Do you stop giving gifts to people because they have a job and can technically buy their own stuff? If the parents are well-off, a new phone isn't necessarily a huge expense for them.", "This road leads to heartache. They know what they're doing. They just expect you to continue putting up with the blatant favouritism. Go NC and don't look back.", "Didn't see ANY generosity to you, their daughter", "NTA\n\nYour parents are super misogynistic \n\nMake sure if your parents need anything, you tell them to go to your brother. They have invested more in him than you, and you need your time and resources to take care of yourself because you know you can't rely on them\n\nI would spell it out clearly: you take care of yourself and will marry only if you want to. It is not a guarantee, and your parents' blatant sexism is offensive", "NTA. Also the gf sounds just as bad as your brother. I would have NEVER accepted that gift. I think it is time to cut them off. And it is pretty ironic of them to talk about close family ties when they have never respected you.", "NTA\n\nAgain, with pulling other \"family\" into the mix what the hell is wrong with these people.\n\nBlock everyone, including your parents & brother.\n\nIn their world, culture?, you are beneath them.", "NTA", "I'd take all their apologies and say \"I'm apologizing to other people because they deserve it more and you're more than capable of getting over it.\"  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYour culture seems to want to enforce a standard of Males over Females.

It sounds as if you need to go NC with all of them!!!", "OP - your family are assholes. I'm sorry you have them in your life.  \n\nNTA!

So their logic isn't even sound, they're clearly picking sides.", "NTA - your parents are shameless. To repeatedly say that since you will leave the family once you\u2019re married, you are not worth investing in is gross. What happens when you have children later on? Will they be treated just as poorly?\n\nI just want to add that your brother and his greedy girlfriend also suck!", ">  and so on so they support him extra.   \n    \nText him and tell him \"thanks for confirming the feeling I have had all my life, that you have one kid, and me, who you do the bare minimum for.

I am done being the third wheel in the family, the one treated less than so you can lavish love and care on your golden child.  Thank you for making clear where your priorities lie, I need to make it clear that I have self worth and self confidence.  As such, I am going to be cutting you out of my life for a while.  You have my address, if you want to communicate with me, send me a letter, as I will be blocking your number, and if you show up to my house, I will not be answering the door or letting you in, and will call the police if you persist.  For other family, if they call or text me about this, or raise it in any way, they will also be blocked.  I am tired.

By their thinking they should be taking care of you more since you are a woman and need to be supported.

It's the 21st century, enough with this sexism already!", "Your parents are horribly sexist and mysogynistic (IMO). They treat you like a second class citizen in your own family.

If that's your culture, well, frankly it sucks if you ask me. I think you need to distance yourself from them because they will continue to hurt you because they believe that it's okay. You need to focus on your own mental health and your happiness.

Why go visit just to be hurt once again? Ignore them, live your own life. \n\nIf they ask why you do not visit, tell them the truth - you are tired of seeing them treat him better.
