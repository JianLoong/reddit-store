They emphasis our culture of \"close family ties\", and that these are just \"gifts\".

Gifts are a sign of affection, consideration and caring about a person. For your parents to take away your gift and give it to a new GF is horrible.\n\nI would have also left. They showed you just how little they value you. Yes, they did things for you... as any normal parent does. Yet, a normal parent doesn't present a gift, then take it away *in front of you*!\n\nYour extended family are ridiculous and/or getting a false story from your parents.\n\nI am so sorry this was your experience. I had a terrible MIL who passed away. I kept notes to make sure that I *never* act to an in-law the way she treated me.", "NTA - And the fact your parents and brother roped in the rest of your family who were not there to bombard you tells me that they care most about how they are viewed by others than how you view them.  They made sure to get their version of the story out before you could tell anyone your version so they painted themselves in the best light. \n\nUnfortunately it is unlikely they will change unless you are in a position to force the change.   I assume they aren't financially supporting you,  if that is the case,  block contact with them for 3-6 months, when you make contact again do it on your terms without the expectation of gifts and share WHY you broke contact.  How they make you feel time and again,  and see if they want to mend bridges.", "Cut them off ASAP.", "NTA\n\nDon't fold.  Now is the time to draw the proverbial line in the sand and let them know that thier complete lack of respect for you is no longer acceptable. The only assholes that are involved in this are your family.  In fact, find a new tradition to celebrate the holidays with because this kind of bs isn't worth your hurt feelings/emotional wellbeing.", "NTA\n\nWhat are these families where all extended family knows about internal immediate family disagreements and then decides to berate one member of the family?\n\nIs this a real thing? Is this isolated to certain areas of the world? Is my family the one family that doesn't do this?", "NTA. To give your gift to your brothers girlfriend I  front of you and say buy your own is incredibly rude. Go no contact", "Nta", "NTA\n\nThe misogyny and favouritism is blatantly clear. Why would you want to spend time with people who treat you as though you\u2019re an afterthought?", "Respect is a two-way street. \n\nIf they won't respect  their daughter, they should not expect her to respect them.", "100%. \n\nThey are not going to change, hell if they blame you for again for their choosing your sibling over you I gotta wonder why you keep putting yourself into that position. They are never going to learn, so cut them all out and block their numbers, and anyone else who tries to guilt you.", "I don't think it's Golden Child-sim, per se.  The brother is The Boy in the family.  I doubt OP ever stood a chance.", "My parents are generous gifters. They give gifts for all occasions not only to us but to their friends and extended family.", "I don't think it's weird. Do you stop giving gifts to people because they have a job and can technically buy their own stuff? If the parents are well-off, a new phone isn't necessarily a huge expense for them.", "This road leads to heartache. They know what they're doing. They just expect you to continue putting up with the blatant favouritism. Go NC and don't look back.", "Didn't see ANY generosity to you, their daughter"]}
