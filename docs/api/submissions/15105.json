We've been dating for 4 years before getting engaged last year. We've always gotten along well with each other's families and celebrated holidays together. Both of our families were happy when we announced our engagement.\u00a0\n\nI recently found out that my fianc\u00e9 actually has a 15-year old younger sister (let's call her An), who I never met despite her living at her parents and me visiting often. When I asked about her during a family dinner, they glared at me and coldly said I shouldn't mention her and that I should forget about her. The intense response kind of shocked me so I dropped the subject, but I tried to talk about it with my fianc\u00e9 after we got home. He brushed it off and said An doesn't want to be part of the family, so she's not allowed to join any family events or gatherings until she decides to talk to them. Maybe because I'm generally a curious person, but something just felt off. Even at my fianc\u00e9's parents home, there are pictures of their children everywhere, but there's not a single picture of An\u00a0\n\nA few days I contacted An, saying I'd love to get to know my future sister-in-law. We met up in a cafe and she is such a sweet girl. But it turned out she's mute. She can hear, but just can't talk. Her parents got it into their heads that she's able to talk, but chooses not to, because there's no way a child of them would have a disability. So they excluded An from the family until she talks. We talked (I talked, she wrote, I don't know sign language) and I really feel sorry for her. I invited her to my wedding, telling her that I'd love to see her there.\u00a0\n\nWhen I later told this during a family dinner with my fianc\u00e9's family, they blew up. Telling me how I dared to talk to An and to revoke my invitation, because if An doesn't want to talk to them, she doesn't deserve to be a part of the family and shouldn't be allowed to join in family events. They told me I shouldn't stick my nose in their family business. My fianc\u00e9 sided with his parents, telling me to just forget An exist and apologise to his parents. This angered me because I thought my fianc\u00e9 would have my back, and I yelled at them that I'm not going to uninvite her, that she deserves to be treated better.\u00a0\n\nSince then, my fianc\u00e9 has been constantly telling me that I'm behaving like a child throwing a tantrum and to apologise to his family for my behaviour, but I just can't accept the way An is treated. It also made me worry if we end up having children, would my fianc\u00e9 treat our child the same if they'd end have a disability of some kind?\u00a0\n\nSome of my friends are also saying that I should just let it go and not overreact so much. That every family does things their own way, so I should just apologise and do as they tell me to prevent my relationship from suffering. \n\nAITA for inviting An to my wedding, after having learned how my fianc\u00e9 and his family thinks about her?\u00a0", "created_utc": 1681828133, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qow3i/aita_for_inviting_my_fianc\u00e9s_younger_sister_to/", "score": 3390, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
