Some time ago, when my relationship with my boyfriend was relatively new I randomly mentioned him in a conversation because she asked if I had seen the new art section at a museum and I said I had went there with my boyfriend. That\u2019s all I said, mentioned him ONCE. \nThen she told me she doesn\u2019t care about him, and doesn\u2019t care what I do when I\u2019m out with him. Though I let it slide because maybe she had a bad day. \n\nWell then a week ago we were hanging out some friends and my bestie asked how my boyfriend was doing as he is abroad with his family this week. Well Ria heard that and started saying she doesn\u2019t care and that apparently he\u2019s my \u201csugar daddy\u201d because he\u2019s older and \u201clooks like his family is rich\u201d. I don\u2019t think four years is that bad tho, but I do have a few minor insecurities about it because my family were a bit weird about it. \nWell my bestie put Ria in her place and said it was a weird thing to say but I still feel bad. \n\nYesterday I was talking to one of our other mutual friends Joe (who is closer to Ria than me) and he said that I\u2019m the AH for \u201cbeing in a healthy relationship when I know Ria isn\u2019t\u201d. Just for your info Ria is single but once had a boyfriend who was a bit manipulative and we were multiple who helped her out of it. Joe then said I\u2019m shoving my relationship in Ria\u2019s face but I barely ever mention him, which actually kinda bums me out. He told me that it was unfair I mentioned him briefly (he actually said briefly) when Ria had already told me once (again like 4-5 months ago) that she didn\u2019t want to hear about him. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t even met him and I\u2019ve been with him for 5 months. Meanwhile my other friends often want him to tag along and are also friends with him now through me. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t think I talk about him that much, but maybe I do without even realising it. \n\nSo AITA for mentioning my boyfriend when my friend says she doesn\u2019t care?\n\n(Sorry for minor spelling mistakes English isn\u2019t my first language)\n\nEdit: wow thanks for all the support guys it means a lot!!!", "created_utc": 1693139385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162p5to/aita_for_mentioning_my_boyfriend_when_my_friend/", "score": 227, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So we all have to be miserable just bc Ria is?", "As a former 18/19 year old, I can relate to both to OP and Ria on this one. You guys are young and these feelings of jealously, judgment, and bitterness can coincide with also loving and caring about your friend. In my freshman year of college my best friend started dating a 23 year old and was head over heels obsessed. It annoyed the hell out of me and I didn't know why. I try to disguise it as concern over the age-gap but it was jealousy. It wasn't that I didn't want her to be happy, it's that her happiness made my loneliness feel even bigger.  \n\n\nAt that age, many people aren't yet equipped to properly deal with those conflicting emotions. Ria is definitely being the asshole, no doubt about it - but I don't think it means you have to dump her as a friend completely. OP, give her space and time. Hang out with your other friends and stop worrying about stepping on her toes. You deserve to be happy and if she can't handle it then you will have to cut back on her a little for right now. She will realize it on her own and you guys can hopefully patch things up and have an even stronger friendship for it.", "NTA. also, you're allowed to be excited about your new boyfriend who is sweet and kind to you. It doesn't sound like you're actively bragging and it does sound like your friend group in general likes him. Ria is allowed to be jealous as well but if she can't be self aware and kind about her negative feelings then it's time to give her some space. She seems to have some ownership issues over you.", "They need to date each other, so they can cancel each other out.", "Thanks I\u2019m gonna try option one if I get the chance :)", "Yeah I know the age gap is nothing. My parents are just strict in that area lol since there is only 8 days between them", "Thanks I\u2019ll try to think about it!

But yeah the age gap is what it is, when we met I didn\u2019t even know how old he was and it\u2019s just natural. I don\u2019t think the age gap is a problem tho.

Either drop those friendships or confront them about their behavior and let Ria know that she needs better coping mechanisms than putting you down for being happy", "Why are you friends with these people?", "WTF????? NTA. even her friend said briefly. That she had a bad experience doesn't mean everyone else gets to walk on eggshells, it seems she's the problem and has the problem.

Be with those that bring you happiness and joy.", "You are absolutely NTA! Ria needs to simmer down along with Joe. You have the right to be happy and in love. Mentioning your man in a conversation is not a big deal. As a friend they should want to hear how happy you are not the other way around.

And please get a backbone, so that people like them don't affect you so much.", "She\u2019s jealous", "NTA. Ria needs to get over herself and frankly you should drop her as a friend because in reality she isn't one.  Frankly, you should all drop her. She's a shitty friend.", "NTA, your friend is clearly insecure and immature. You weren't rubbing your relationship in her face. It came up in conversation. She either has a crush on you or your BF, or she needs to deal with her own trauma. There's no reason why she should be pissed at you for being in a relationship.", "NTA. Sounds like your friends are very immature. You can tell Ria that you care about her. You can also say your relationship isn't a snub at her. \n\nBTW, friends, when you're young, rarely last because everyone grows and changes. That is okay. It's also okay not to have people around you who are negative and draining.", "She could also just be immature and have that high school thing of if you\u2019re my friend you can\u2019t be her friend etc. so than anyone else that OP spends time with it will be a problem. I am sure that once she reads both of our comments she will know what one applies to Ria. It could be any of those possibilities.", "Cut it out right now???? WTF even is that advice!! She can talk about her boyfriend as often as she wants. It isn't anyone's place to tell her not to. Especially if he's a huge part of her life. Someone in the friend group asked her a specific question and she shouldn't have to edit her conversations to appease someone else.", "No, it really doesn\u2019t depend on that", "Welcome to the chat Ria. Grow up or no one will ever want to date you ever.", "Did she possibly have a crush on this guy before you hooked up with him? This behavior is just so odd.", "STAY that way. Don't Tell her anything personal or private about your B/F. When someone asks about him ~ answer. If she has a problem then she needs to deal with it.  You're doing NOTHING wrong. Her relationship broke up that is on her. I will say this, you need to start distancing yourself from her cuz she is going to cause you problems."]}
