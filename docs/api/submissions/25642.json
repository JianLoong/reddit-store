He\u2019s the kindest person ever and I\u2019m so in love. The problem is that one of my closest friends let\u2019s call her Ria (18F) has been all weird about it. Some time ago, when my relationship with my boyfriend was relatively new I randomly mentioned him in a conversation because she asked if I had seen the new art section at a museum and I said I had went there with my boyfriend. That\u2019s all I said, mentioned him ONCE. \nThen she told me she doesn\u2019t care about him, and doesn\u2019t care what I do when I\u2019m out with him. Though I let it slide because maybe she had a bad day. \n\nWell then a week ago we were hanging out some friends and my bestie asked how my boyfriend was doing as he is abroad with his family this week. Well Ria heard that and started saying she doesn\u2019t care and that apparently he\u2019s my \u201csugar daddy\u201d because he\u2019s older and \u201clooks like his family is rich\u201d. I don\u2019t think four years is that bad tho, but I do have a few minor insecurities about it because my family were a bit weird about it. \nWell my bestie put Ria in her place and said it was a weird thing to say but I still feel bad. \n\nYesterday I was talking to one of our other mutual friends Joe (who is closer to Ria than me) and he said that I\u2019m the AH for \u201cbeing in a healthy relationship when I know Ria isn\u2019t\u201d. Just for your info Ria is single but once had a boyfriend who was a bit manipulative and we were multiple who helped her out of it. Joe then said I\u2019m shoving my relationship in Ria\u2019s face but I barely ever mention him, which actually kinda bums me out. He told me that it was unfair I mentioned him briefly (he actually said briefly) when Ria had already told me once (again like 4-5 months ago) that she didn\u2019t want to hear about him. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t even met him and I\u2019ve been with him for 5 months. Meanwhile my other friends often want him to tag along and are also friends with him now through me. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t think I talk about him that much, but maybe I do without even realising it. \n\nSo AITA for mentioning my boyfriend when my friend says she doesn\u2019t care?\n\n(Sorry for minor spelling mistakes English isn\u2019t my first language)\n\nEdit: wow thanks for all the support guys it means a lot!!!", "created_utc": 1693139385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162p5to/aita_for_mentioning_my_boyfriend_when_my_friend/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She has low self esteem and stayed in a toxic relationship until her friends pulled her out. Now that she\u2019s alone, and feels insecure, she has to dominate you once more so she decided to throw doubt onto your relationship by essentially calling you a gold digger.

People talk about their partners often since the partner usually ends up being such a big part of your life that it's almost impossible not to talk about them some times.

It sounds like you need to reevaluate the friendship.", "No, your friend is being an immature jackass because she's jealous. And she's clearly talking about you behind your back if she convinced that other \"friend\" that you shove your bf in her face. A true friend is happy for you when life is going well for you. This girl isnt your friend and maybe she should start being excluded in your outings since your other friends seem to like your man and want to invite him to come out with them.

Your friend can't say ANYTHING about her boyfriend, even AROUND you? Get a life. Ultimately, I'm getting jealousy vibes, which I think Joe kind of proves. \n\nAnd Joe, to me, is an even bigger AH. So if you are out in a group, you're not even allowed to talk about your boyfriend even if someone asks? Wow... like, just wow. \n\nThey are not your friends. Full stop.

So we all have to be miserable just bc Ria is?", "As a former 18/19 year old, I can relate to both to OP and Ria on this one. You guys are young and these feelings of jealously, judgment, and bitterness can coincide with also loving and caring about your friend. In my freshman year of college my best friend started dating a 23 year old and was head over heels obsessed. It annoyed the hell out of me and I didn't know why. I try to disguise it as concern over the age-gap but it was jealousy. It wasn't that I didn't want her to be happy, it's that her happiness made my loneliness feel even bigger.  \n\n\nAt that age, many people aren't yet equipped to properly deal with those conflicting emotions. Ria is definitely being the asshole, no doubt about it - but I don't think it means you have to dump her as a friend completely. OP, give her space and time. Hang out with your other friends and stop worrying about stepping on her toes. You deserve to be happy and if she can't handle it then you will have to cut back on her a little for right now. She will realize it on her own and you guys can hopefully patch things up and have an even stronger friendship for it.", "NTA. also, you're allowed to be excited about your new boyfriend who is sweet and kind to you. It doesn't sound like you're actively bragging and it does sound like your friend group in general likes him. Ria is allowed to be jealous as well but if she can't be self aware and kind about her negative feelings then it's time to give her some space. She seems to have some ownership issues over you.", "They need to date each other, so they can cancel each other out.", "Thanks I\u2019m gonna try option one if I get the chance :)", "Yeah I know the age gap is nothing. My parents are just strict in that area lol since there is only 8 days between them", "Thanks I\u2019ll try to think about it! I don\u2019t really bring him up much, mostly when I\u2019m just talking about a situation where he was there or when people ask about him, but I might have missed some times!", "I\u2019m a pretty private person and I never really just start talking about myself unless someone asks. But yeah the age gap is what it is, when we met I didn\u2019t even know how old he was and it\u2019s just natural. I don\u2019t think the age gap is a problem tho. I\u2019m turning 20 really soon and his birthday has already been had this year.", "By his name of course", "I\u2019ve actually gotten told this years back when we were literal children.
