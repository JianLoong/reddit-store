He\u2019s the kindest person ever and I\u2019m so in love. The problem is that one of my closest friends let\u2019s call her Ria (18F) has been all weird about it. Some time ago, when my relationship with my boyfriend was relatively new I randomly mentioned him in a conversation because she asked if I had seen the new art section at a museum and I said I had went there with my boyfriend. That\u2019s all I said, mentioned him ONCE. \nThen she told me she doesn\u2019t care about him, and doesn\u2019t care what I do when I\u2019m out with him. Though I let it slide because maybe she had a bad day. \n\nWell then a week ago we were hanging out some friends and my bestie asked how my boyfriend was doing as he is abroad with his family this week. Well Ria heard that and started saying she doesn\u2019t care and that apparently he\u2019s my \u201csugar daddy\u201d because he\u2019s older and \u201clooks like his family is rich\u201d. I don\u2019t think four years is that bad tho, but I do have a few minor insecurities about it because my family were a bit weird about it. \nWell my bestie put Ria in her place and said it was a weird thing to say but I still feel bad. \n\nYesterday I was talking to one of our other mutual friends Joe (who is closer to Ria than me) and he said that I\u2019m the AH for \u201cbeing in a healthy relationship when I know Ria isn\u2019t\u201d. Just for your info Ria is single but once had a boyfriend who was a bit manipulative and we were multiple who helped her out of it. Joe then said I\u2019m shoving my relationship in Ria\u2019s face but I barely ever mention him, which actually kinda bums me out. He told me that it was unfair I mentioned him briefly (he actually said briefly) when Ria had already told me once (again like 4-5 months ago) that she didn\u2019t want to hear about him. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t even met him and I\u2019ve been with him for 5 months. Meanwhile my other friends often want him to tag along and are also friends with him now through me. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t think I talk about him that much, but maybe I do without even realising it. \n\nSo AITA for mentioning my boyfriend when my friend says she doesn\u2019t care?\n\n(Sorry for minor spelling mistakes English isn\u2019t my first language)", "created_utc": 1693139385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162p5to/aita_for_mentioning_my_boyfriend_when_my_friend/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Still, she's clearly jealous and needs to get over it. Otherwise, you're well within your rights to distance yourself from her.", "NTA and ria is not a friend OP.

You have two extremely unreasonable friends. NTA.", "NTA. She\u2019s jealous. She needs to get over herself and apologize big time. \n\nI was in a really toxic spot with my friend who was in a really toxic spot and when she got out and met someone new I was jealous as fuck. JEALOUS! I asked her to give me a little time to not be a sick head and now I\u2019m happy as hell for her. \n\nMisery loves company and a true friend will be happy to see you happy, even if it stings and reminds her of what she\u2019s missing. Not your fault!", "NTA.  If she was actually concerned for your wellbeing, making snarky comments isn't the way to do it.  She's honestly just TA.", "NTA you are having a healthy relationship and you are an adult so you can be in a relationship with anyone you want as long as it is healthy. Ria and her friend seem delusional for thinking anyone having a healthy relationship is a bad thing.", "NTA-give Ria a little distance and grace. She sounds like she\u2019s struggling. \n\nJoe, on the other hand, needs to be put in his place. He clearly doesn\u2019t know the first thing about supporting friends.

This is a Rita problem, not a you problem.  (Joe is also an AH btw.)\n\nI get it, she's very jealous and went through a bad relationship.  But life for everyone doesn't just stop as a result.  And you sound like you're being pretty sensitive about it anyway.\n\nShe has no business calling you a sugar baby and being dismissive about your relationship.  She may be a close friend but she isn't acting like one.\n\nTwo options:  1) have a heart to heart with her and tell her that you know that she's been through a lot, but you're sad that she can't be happy for you.  or 2) limit contact.

They are toxic and will only bring you down. They are jealous and resent you being able. They will resent and taint every good thing that comes in your life.", "Not the asshole. \nYour friend has some serious problems if she keeps reacting that way. She is probably jealous you have a boyfriend.  \nAlso, the age gap is not that large, and it isn't weird.", "Nta you can\u2019t live your life in this way, in this specific situation you should put ria on the back burner.

You're such an asshole for continuing to live as though you have your own goals and dreams that don't revolve around her!\" \n\nThat's what your friend is going with? That's the argument?! No. NTA.", "NTA. You need better friends\n\nFriends mutually have an interest in each other and what's going on in each of your lives.

If you have to see her every day, then put her and Joe on an information diet. Don't talk about your boyfriend or anything else about your life. Save that for your actual friends. Avoid them when possible.", "NTA. She\u2019s simply jealous.", "NTA. Both of these people are not your friends. Ria only keeps you around to serve her purpose and to inflate her ego. She kept you around because it made her feel superior to you. Having a boyfriend while you were single made her feel big and strong. She has low self esteem and stayed in a toxic relationship until her friends pulled her out. Now that she\u2019s alone, and feels insecure, she has to dominate you once more so she decided to throw doubt onto your relationship by essentially calling you a gold digger. Ria will continue gaslighting you and making you the scapegoat and leveraging her relationship with the other friend to keep you in line. She wants your other friend to play their role and beat you back into submission. Ria sounds like a malignant narcissist.", "Omg girl she ain\u2019t your friend \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd14 don\u2019t give her any more of your time or thoughts", "NTA \n\nDrop your friend and block the other one.

You're not reciting poetry about him to her. If she needs you ton pretend he doesn't exist to not be upset then life will be hard for her going forward into adulthood", "I\u2019ve never noticed her being like that with anyone else in the friend group. Normally she\u2019s the stereotypical over the top happy girl who loves to get all the tea and drama. Just not with me apparently. But with my ex (even tho it never got serious) she wasn\u2019t like this either so I don\u2019t know.", "Yeah Ria is a bitter and selfish friend. NTA.\n\nBut the first time your bf tags along, you should be the asshole, sit on his lap the entire time and receive as many kisses as possible! /s", "Hmmm I could be wrong of course but I see her almost every day and I think I mention him like once a week or less? I\u2019m pretty private with my life in a sense so I don\u2019t bring him up a lot.", "She literally mentioned him when someone asked a question about him...how is that supposed to be 'insanely annoying'", "I never bring him up just to talk about him, just mention him when he\u2019s been there in the context of which we were talking about.

Hope you have a nice day :)", "Have you asked your boyfriend if he knows her?\n\nAnyway, she most likely either has a crush on you or your boyfriend.", "Because she viewed him as worse than her boyfriend so she kept you around so she could hear you complaining about him to make herself feel better\u2026.", "The other possibility is she\u2019s super competitive with YOU in particular. For instance, maybe she thinks she\u2019s prettier than you, and can\u2019t stand that YOU have a well off, hot older boyfriend when that should be HER life.\n\nI had a \u201cfriend\u201d like this.

Your friends were being dicks.", "It really doesn't matter how much you mention him to be honest. People talk about their partners often since the partner usually ends up being such a big part of your life that it's almost impossible not to talk about them some times. Real friends should want to know what's going on in your life, which means you occasionally mentioning things you did with your partner. The fact that she has such an issue with it makes her seem extremely jealous and not a true friend to you at all.", "If you have been single for a while, or this is your first serious relationship, she\u2019s probably used your single status as making herself feel better. Like, she may have yad a bad relationship, but at least she had one... Mean stuff like that. Now you are in a relationship and are happy, she\u2019s trying to bring you down, because she\u2019s jealous. And her delusion has been shettered."]}
