Once you guys start using \u201cI feel\u2026\u201d expressions, there may be more room for actual communication. \n\nYou handled it well", "NTA. She made it plain that she didn't want to hear anything he had to say about why he was short.  Not even snotty, just short. It's going to be a long hard haul if, every time somebody gets exasperated while trying to feed a toddler and a small child, the other party takes it personally.", "NTA. She was being self righteous and didn't even know what she wanted. She couldn't even explain how she wanted to proceed. She just picked a fight, assumed the worst of you, and shut down the conversation once she said her piece. \n\nI don't care what her therapist said, she got on a soapbox to pick that fight and you didn't engage. She set you up to fail with that one.", "NTA. She set you up for failure from the get-go. \n\nShe over-reacted to your, rightful, frustration. This situation reminds me of what my abusive husband used to do. I\u2019d be in impossible situations, he\u2019d ask me to do something that he could easily do himself. No matter how nicely I replied \u201cno\u201d or said that he could do it, it became my fault.

If this is her normal behavior then you may have deeper issues.", "NTA\n\nDoes she have eyes and hands? Was she tied up or otherwise incapacitated? Could she maybe have helped with the kids as you were clearly busy with them?", "NTA. It sounds like you are both dealing with a lot. Two young children, work, holiday stuff, and your wife working through old trauma. Communication issues are going to happen. I completely understand why you were frustrated, but just to give you some insight when I was going through therapy it definitely made me more sensitive to what I perceived as a negative tone from my husband. It may be worth apologizing for shutting her down when she was trying to explain how she was feeling, and hopefully she will be open to hearing that you were just feeling stressed in the moment. It may also be good for the two of you to go to a couple of sessions together to work on understanding each other\u2019s communication styles.", "NTA", "Question, did you raise your voice to her, did you yell? Did you use heavy sarcasm? \n\nIf yes, then yeah ,You are the AH.Not for the words but for the hurtful tone. \n\nIf no then this is a grey area.\n\nPerhaps She could have been more understanding that it was a really bad time to verbally poke the bear with a stick. Putting your child\u2019s food away was pretty childish. Perhaps she is not good at reading people, or misreads the body language.\n\nMy family is well aware that when I\u2019m upset, don\u2019t talk to me for 15 minutes, don\u2019t poke the bear, after a bit I calm down and will discuss the issue reasonably.", "ESH. Her for thinking \u201cnothing\u201d she could do would reasonably provoke a curt response from you.  You for not examining your own behavior while considering her message that you tend to rationalize your own behavior and dismissing or invalidating her feelings/point of view. Both of you for poor communication. I recommend you together read a couple of books by John and Julie Gottmann. I also recommend that you two together look on their website for their formulated rules for communicating in conflict and for what they call \u201csoftened start-ups\u201d to conversations that are or might be difficult. Also look at their \u201cFour Horsemen of the Marital Apocalypse\u201d and examine each of your behavior while considering whether you commit any of those destructive attitudes and behaviors. Some marriage counseling might be helpful, but not if your wife is afraid to be honest. Regardless of how effectively she communicated her feelings that night, it took some courage for her to do that and I think she deserves validation and encouragement for that reason.", "NTA for the way you spoke to her at the dinner table (maybe curt but exasperated and understandable). You are however TA for blowing her off and shutting her down when she was trying to be vulnerable with her feelings about the situation and talking to you in a respectful and open way. \n\nMaybe a session or two of couples therapy in addition to her individual therapy? Ideally not with the same therapist. Just to establish some ground rules for disagreements and to have some common expectations for each other and the way you handle each other\u2019s feelings. Good luck. This sounds fixable and it sounds like your wife is putting in the effort. Meet her halfway.", "Nta we all have those moments", "NTA.  She really didn\u2019t want a conversation.  She wanted to tell you what you did wrong (in her estimation).  No way this would go well for you.  Smart to walk away.", "YTA, from the sounds of it. She just wanted to have a frank discussion about how you spoke to her, and you were flippant in response.", "YTA While I don\u2019t think your initial reaction was completely uncalled for, if not ideal, your inability to talk about it, acknowledge your wife\u2019s feelings, or speak about your own was completely immature and self destructive if you value your marriage.", "YTA. Your wife shouldn\u2019t have said that she was afraid you\u2019d get defensive before you even had a chance to say anything because that definitely makes it hard for you to actually fix the issue, but the way you handled this is pretty immature, tbh. What she probably wanted was for you to understand why she was upset and apologize properly for it. If it makes you feel any better, I have a lot of issues myself and therapy has really helped me communicate better with my partner. It seems like she\u2019s on a good path to being able to voice her concerns with you in a healthier way. You need to meet her in the middle, though. Nothing is solved if this is the way you handle issues. It\u2019s the same effect as not handling them at all, at best, and compounding them at worst.", "YTA.

It may be worth apologizing for shutting her down when she was trying to explain how she was feeling\n\nthis is particularly insightful. Thank you.", "During initial dinner comment, no, tired exasperation. Asking to get food back out, probably some implied 'why did you put it away in the first place?' After kids were in bed - complete deadpan. I knew she was upset. I knew I didn't want to talk about it. I actually thought she would continue the silent treatment and just let me go do some work.", ">Regardless of how effectively she communicated her feelings that night, it took some courage for her to do that and I think she deserves validation and encouragement for that reason.\n\nThis is an important point. I personally would only be reluctant to share my feelings because I don't want to deal with the after-effects, (swallow it, let it go.... also not healthy), but she has actually been heavily criticized for this in her past by her parents. I know this. I've seen it from them. I certainly didn't have the presence of mind to consider this in the moment. I will mentioned this specifically when we talk about this tomorrow.", "Also good advice. Thank you.", "I appreciate the rational response.\n\nThis is definitely fixable. It happened like an hour ago. We'll discuss it again tomorrow, and proceed from there.", "Yeah, I don't necessarily disagree with you. At this time it just seemed like she had thrown up every possible wall to an actual conversation. Given the circumstances during dinner her inquiry about the mug just seemed completely oblivious to what was actually happening at the time.", "Granted. My only response would be the timing. By no means do I think that we won't talk about it. We will. I just wasn't making time for it tonight.", "I totally agree, and if this was our regular MO I'd be worried.\n\nINFO: I have a huge project on the go, and I really seriously needed to spend some time on it tonight. Honestly though now I've spent (wasted) a bunch of time on Reddit so I'm no further ahead. \n\nWe will discuss this. Likely tomorrow after the kids are in bed. She will voice her concerns, I will voice mine. We are mature adults...generally. \n\nTonight felt different. She got pissed because I was short with her and prepared this (seemingly) air-tight defence. I have other stuff I need to focus on. She knows this as well.", "Umm... Yes. yes very much. I love my wife.\n\nPeople in long-term relationships do have disagreements, even serious ones.", "You\u2019re willing to try. That\u2019s important. I don\u2019t know your wife\u2019s history, but trauma takes many forms. Sometimes it shouts. Sometimes its the erosive, whispering result of a longstanding pattern of invalidation by the childhood caretakers by whom a child needed to feel protected, loved, and admired. We tend to think of trauma as big, terrifying, painful events. Traumatic experience is not limited to so clean a definition. If you, your wife, and her therapist believe that your wife has (or you have) had the experience of more insidious trauma it might benefit you both if you undertook to understand what trauma does emotionally, spiritually, relationally, and biologically. It sounds like both of you experienced some degree of invalidation of thoughts or feelings early on, but I could be reading in more than is actually there. One thing I have learned about relationships is that moments of conflict are inevitable and if you want honesty you have to make it safe for honesty to be revealed with all of its attendant vulnerability. You don\u2019t have to be happy about what you hear, but try and be grateful you heard it because you can\u2019t repair what you don\u2019t know has been damaged. Another thing I think is that it\u2019s always useful to listen for the feelings under the words instead of focusing solely on the words and respond to the feelings.", "Of course yeah. It\u2019s not always easy to navigate this stuff especially with small children and past trauma/baggage in the mix.

Are you incapable of doing it yourself ? Are your arms broken ?", "That\u2019s fine, I just think that from her perspective, you being stressed/busy/what have you doesn\u2019t justify getting frustrated with her. We all get stressed and sometimes as a result, we treat people poorly. It\u2019s okay to slip up. What\u2019s not okay is not taking accountability for making your wife upset. You\u2019re allowed to make mistakes, you just have to own up to them. Doesn\u2019t make you a bad person for getting snappy as long as you apologize after the fact.", "This isn't a disagreement. A disagreement is when you want one thing for dinner, and she wants another.\n\nThis is you being a raging, inconsiderate asshole who, honestly? Sounds like they have more than one red flag for abuse.\n\nIts not a \"disagreement\" to completely shut down any attempt to have a conversation because you'd already decided what she had to say wasn't worth listening to.", "We will certainly work it out :) This particular argument just seemed to start with a huge amount of defensiveness, preempting any sort of response that I could make. \n\nI am curious if I am an AH for not engaging at the time, and waiting until tomorrow.

While he\u2019s trying to get the kids to eat why isn\u2019t his wife helping?", "You're blowing it out of proportion.", "Holy fucking reach.", "You sound like a teenager with no real life experience.", "I think maybe you need to try therapy together? I can\u2019t speak for your partner, but as someone who has similar issues with trauma, someone walking away from a conflict can be equally as distressing as the fight itself. Sounds like you love each other and just need to figure out a way to communicate with each other a little better. \n\n\nWishing you both all the best!", "Yeah, thanks for the back-up on that one. It felt like a stretch to equate my choosing to (temporarily) avoid an argument to........raging abuse?\n\nInconsiderate perhaps. I'll grant them that one.
