I most certainly was AH-ish when left the room.\n\nReading some comments convinced to expedite my apology, and I did first thing this morning. I apologized mainly for being dismissive when she was trying to talk to me, as that is the part that upset her the most. The precipitating event is not likely to be discussed any further at this point, but next time I will try to adjust my tone, and just explicitly state that I have a lot going on right now and don't have the capacity for chatting about XYZ as that may not have been clear to her. I do think it should have been clear, but it may not have been.\n\nINFO: To clear up a few assumptions. \n\n\\-At the time I was sitting with the kids she was eating herself and beginning to clean up in the kitchen. This is normal and goes both ways. One of us focused on the kids, the other keeping the house going. The one with the kids always has the biggest task.\n\n\\-I made dinner.\n\n\\-Neither of us work (outside the home) on Saturdays.\n\n\\-She obviously did not ask me to grovel. That was my exaggeration back to her of what she said to me that she was basically giving me no other options.\n\n\\-It is verbatim. I wrote the post almost immediately after it happened.

She made it plain that she didn't want to hear anything he had to say about why he was short.  Not even snotty, just short.

Two young children, work, holiday stuff, and your wife working through old trauma. Communication issues are going to happen. I completely understand why you were frustrated, but just to give you some insight when I was going through therapy it definitely made me more sensitive to what I perceived as a negative tone from my husband. It may be worth apologizing for shutting her down when she was trying to explain how she was feeling, and hopefully she will be open to hearing that you were just feeling stressed in the moment.

Her for thinking \u201cnothing\u201d she could do would reasonably provoke a curt response from you.  You for not examining your own behavior while considering her message that you tend to rationalize your own behavior and dismissing or invalidating her feelings/point of view. Both of you for poor communication. I recommend you together read a couple of books by John and Julie Gottmann. I also recommend that you two together look on their website for their formulated rules for communicating in conflict and for what they call \u201csoftened start-ups\u201d to conversations that are or might be difficult. Also look at their \u201cFour Horsemen of the Marital Apocalypse\u201d and examine each of your behavior while considering whether you commit any of those destructive attitudes and behaviors. Some marriage counseling might be helpful, but not if your wife is afraid to be honest. Regardless of how effectively she communicated her feelings that night, it took some courage for her to do that and I think she deserves validation and encouragement for that reason.", "NTA for the way you spoke to her at the dinner table (maybe curt but exasperated and understandable). You are however TA for blowing her off and shutting her down when she was trying to be vulnerable with her feelings about the situation and talking to you in a respectful and open way. \n\nMaybe a session or two of couples therapy in addition to her individual therapy? Ideally not with the same therapist. Just to establish some ground rules for disagreements and to have some common expectations for each other and the way you handle each other\u2019s feelings.

Your wife shouldn\u2019t have said that she was afraid you\u2019d get defensive before you even had a chance to say anything because that definitely makes it hard for you to actually fix the issue, but the way you handled this is pretty immature, tbh. What she probably wanted was for you to understand why she was upset and apologize properly for it. If it makes you feel any better, I have a lot of issues myself and therapy has really helped me communicate better with my partner. It seems like she\u2019s on a good path to being able to voice her concerns with you in a healthier way. You need to meet her in the middle, though.

She will voice her concerns, I will voice mine. We are mature adults...generally. \n\nTonight felt different.

I don\u2019t know your wife\u2019s history, but trauma takes many forms. Sometimes it shouts. Sometimes its the erosive, whispering result of a longstanding pattern of invalidation by the childhood caretakers by whom a child needed to feel protected, loved, and admired. We tend to think of trauma as big, terrifying, painful events. Traumatic experience is not limited to so clean a definition. If you, your wife, and her therapist believe that your wife has (or you have) had the experience of more insidious trauma it might benefit you both if you undertook to understand what trauma does emotionally, spiritually, relationally, and biologically. It sounds like both of you experienced some degree of invalidation of thoughts or feelings early on, but I could be reading in more than is actually there. One thing I have learned about relationships is that moments of conflict are inevitable and if you want honesty you have to make it safe for honesty to be revealed with all of its attendant vulnerability. You don\u2019t have to be happy about what you hear, but try and be grateful you heard it because you can\u2019t repair what you don\u2019t know has been damaged.

Kids were being a handful for you and you didn\u2019t feel like your wife was helping, got it. Now please explain what your wife was dealing with. Was she perhaps trying to actually make the dinner? Clean up the kitchen? Was she just getting off a long day herself? Had she been dealing with the kids the majority of the day up to this point?

Maybe go back to read his post with a more objective/curious mindset. This is a disagreement. And fairly tame one tbh. And OP came here to get some objective advice.

If that\u2019s the case I hope things turn up for you and your outlook improves. Genuinely.", "NTA", "I'm going to go with yta. You saying that usually you each do one kid for bedtime I feel like you typically split up parenting responsibilities. Idk if she was cleaning or cooking or whatever while you fed the kids, but at least for now I'm going to assume both of you are relatively good partners/parents. \n\nIt does sound like your tone was rude. People in the comments are saying that we should ignore a SO's tone during arguments but I don't think that's true. People can convey a lot through tone, they can be sarcastic, mean, dismissive etc. I don't see why your wife shouldn't be able to plainly say that you were rude to her when you were in fact rude to her. Some people are saying she shouldn't have started off with accusations and that's kind of crazy to me. I can't believe we're out here saying that people who are disrespected have to address it in just the right way otherwise they're wrong. She didn't shout or call him names or verbally abuse him. She didn't do anything wrong. It isn't manipulative to be direct or to name the behavior you're upset about. \n\nI'm also on guard by you saying that the only valid reaction would be to fall to your knees groveling. It makes me think you are uninterested in having genuine conversations. Why is it unreasonable to apologize after you're kind of rude? You don't have to grovel, apologizing is very easy. \"I'm sorry, my tone was kind of rude. I'll do my best not to do that anymore. I was really frustrated, can we talk about ways for us to prevent such frustrating moments in the future?\". I interpreted your wife's words to mean there's no valid excuses for being rude to her because there isn't. We are all rude or hurtful sometimes and that's human, but we do still have the obligation to Apologize and do better. \n\nI feel like exaggerating a reasonable request so the other person seems ridiculous is so manipulative. You're pretending like she wanted you to grovel when all she's asking is that you don't use a rude tone when talking to her.\n\n\nEdit:\nI'm also side eying where she tells you she was afraid of bringing it up to you because you would just justify it. In a good partnership you shouldn't be afraid to tell the other person about little things like this. I've been short with my husband and he's been short with me. We usually address it right away, it keeps resentment from building. Do you often dismiss her feelings? Are you often rude to her when you're frustrated?", "I'm torn. I wanna say ESH but I think there's a lot more going on that your side alone cannot provide. You sound overwhelmed and possibly overworked. I'm assuming she has a lot of trauma based on her \"shit-storm\" of an upbringing so her responses to certain reactions and tones are a product of that, but it sounds like she's working on it with the therapy.\n\n\nI don't like the way she said \"there is nothing I could do that could justify you speaking to me that way\" because it sounds like she's immediately dismissing you and absolving herself of any past, present, or future wrongdoing. But it also sounds like she's trying to figure out how to stand up for herself. Maybe this wasn't the best situation to do that but idk.\n\n\nBased on this post, I don't think your response was that bad. It sounds like it came from a place of stress and burnout. However, she had such an extreme reaction to it and the fact that she felt afraid to bring it up is making me hesitate. Y'all need to sit down and have a serious talk.", "Nta. She needs a better therapist", "NTA\nYour wife needs to read the room. Choose an appropriate time to ask such questions which require explanations.  \nYou could have apologised for your tone but the content was fine.\nShe is finding ways to use the tools she has learnt at therapy but applying them takes time to get it right. This is salvageable", "Nta", "Sounds like you\u2019re both shattered and need some sleep.", "This this this. \n\nEven just saying, \"I feel like there is no justification for you talking to me that way\" is *loads* better for actual productive communication, because even though it's still fairly accusatory, it comes across as much less aggressive. Without \"I feel\", it ends up just being her putting words and thoughts into OP's mouth/head and giving them no productive way to respond... which is exactly what happened. She had already decided that the only \"correct\" response was an enthusiastic apology from OP and was not actually willing to engage in a mutual discussion. \n\nAnd while yes, perhaps she did deserve an apology, she went about it so aggressively that she ended up backing OP into a corner, which isn't actually productive. Had she gone about it differently, OP probably would have told her that they had just been feeling overwhelmed and frustrated by the kid situation and hadn't meant to snap at her, and was sorry for the tone that they used (I assume this due to OP's open acknowledgement that they *did* snap at her a bit and respond in an overly exasperated tone).", "Ok so what if she didn't communicate her feelings in the least confrontational way possible. Did therapy teach you to use a rude tone with your partner? Did it teach you to blow their request out of proportion? She literally just said she found his tone rude. She didn't barate him for hours or demand he \"grovel\" like he's pretending. \n\nDid therapy teach you to ignore your partners hurt feelings if they don't phrase them in exactly the best way possible? Find a better therapist.", "Or he could just apologize and they could communicate about better strategies to parent or blow off steam.

I do wonder how many times that he's been clean up and she's been feeding the kids he's asked her questions that seem annoying or inane to her, but she just answers them -- and vice versa.\n\nSometimes when my husband asks me something and I'm doing/focusing on something else, I'll hit my limit and be snappish.  I apologize when that happens.\n\nIt seems like asking a question over dinner isn't a totally off the wall unreasonable thing for one spouse to do.  I imagine that they do, in fact, talk to each other occasionally during dinner, even when trying to get the kids to eat.  It seems like here, the timing was bad and he reacted badly.  Then, she overreacted in her attempt to assert herself, and he overreacted in his response to her.\n\nIt also seems like she didn't know that he needed to do more work that night; he didn't tell her until after the kids were already asleep.  So, he's stressing about finishing feeding the kids, getting them to bed, and then getting to the basement to work, and she's thinking that there's no external time pressure because it's Saturday night.\n\nThis is the kind of stuff that happens in relationships.  But I don't think it's reasonable to say that, as a general principle, a person dealing with an emotional toddler literally cannot think about or do anything else and that other people should just accept that they're going to get treated poorly if they try to interact with that person.", "> My point about your metaphor isnt that its not literal but a toddler refusing to eat dinner is hardly a crazy situation. \n\nCrazy, no, but a screaming toddler throwing a tantrum makes it kind of difficult to hold a conversation unless you're going to hold said conversation at shouting volume."]}
