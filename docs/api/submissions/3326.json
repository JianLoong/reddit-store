It may be worth apologizing for shutting her down when she was trying to explain how she was feeling, and hopefully she will be open to hearing that you were just feeling stressed in the moment.

I also recommend that you two together look on their website for their formulated rules for communicating in conflict and for what they call \u201csoftened start-ups\u201d to conversations that are or might be difficult. Also look at their \u201cFour Horsemen of the Marital Apocalypse\u201d and examine each of your behavior while considering whether you commit any of those destructive attitudes and behaviors.

Your wife shouldn\u2019t have said that she was afraid you\u2019d get defensive before you even had a chance to say anything because that definitely makes it hard for you to actually fix the issue, but the way you handled this is pretty immature, tbh. What she probably wanted was for you to understand why she was upset and apologize properly for it. If it makes you feel any better, I have a lot of issues myself and therapy has really helped me communicate better with my partner. It seems like she\u2019s on a good path to being able to voice her concerns with you in a healthier way. You need to meet her in the middle, though.

She will voice her concerns, I will voice mine. We are mature adults...generally. \n\nTonight felt different.

I don\u2019t know your wife\u2019s history, but trauma takes many forms. Sometimes it shouts. Sometimes its the erosive, whispering result of a longstanding pattern of invalidation by the childhood caretakers by whom a child needed to feel protected, loved, and admired. We tend to think of trauma as big, terrifying, painful events. Traumatic experience is not limited to so clean a definition. If you, your wife, and her therapist believe that your wife has (or you have) had the experience of more insidious trauma it might benefit you both if you undertook to understand what trauma does emotionally, spiritually, relationally, and biologically. It sounds like both of you experienced some degree of invalidation of thoughts or feelings early on, but I could be reading in more than is actually there. One thing I have learned about relationships is that moments of conflict are inevitable and if you want honesty you have to make it safe for honesty to be revealed with all of its attendant vulnerability. You don\u2019t have to be happy about what you hear, but try and be grateful you heard it because you can\u2019t repair what you don\u2019t know has been damaged.

Kids were being a handful for you and you didn\u2019t feel like your wife was helping, got it. Now please explain what your wife was dealing with. Was she perhaps trying to actually make the dinner? Clean up the kitchen? Was she just getting off a long day herself? Had she been dealing with the kids the majority of the day up to this point?

Maybe go back to read his post with a more objective/curious mindset. This is a disagreement. And fairly tame one tbh. And OP came here to get some objective advice.

If that\u2019s the case I hope things turn up for you and your outlook improves. Genuinely.", "NTA", "I'm going to go with yta. You saying that usually you each do one kid for bedtime I feel like you typically split up parenting responsibilities. Idk if she was cleaning or cooking or whatever while you fed the kids, but at least for now I'm going to assume both of you are relatively good partners/parents. \n\nIt does sound like your tone was rude. People in the comments are saying that we should ignore a SO's tone during arguments but I don't think that's true. People can convey a lot through tone, they can be sarcastic, mean, dismissive etc. I don't see why your wife shouldn't be able to plainly say that you were rude to her when you were in fact rude to her. Some people are saying she shouldn't have started off with accusations and that's kind of crazy to me. I can't believe we're out here saying that people who are disrespected have to address it in just the right way otherwise they're wrong. She didn't shout or call him names or verbally abuse him. She didn't do anything wrong. It isn't manipulative to be direct or to name the behavior you're upset about. \n\nI'm also on guard by you saying that the only valid reaction would be to fall to your knees groveling. It makes me think you are uninterested in having genuine conversations. Why is it unreasonable to apologize after you're kind of rude? You don't have to grovel, apologizing is very easy. \"I'm sorry, my tone was kind of rude. I'll do my best not to do that anymore. I was really frustrated, can we talk about ways for us to prevent such frustrating moments in the future?\". I interpreted your wife's words to mean there's no valid excuses for being rude to her because there isn't. We are all rude or hurtful sometimes and that's human, but we do still have the obligation to Apologize and do better. \n\nI feel like exaggerating a reasonable request so the other person seems ridiculous is so manipulative. You're pretending like she wanted you to grovel when all she's asking is that you don't use a rude tone when talking to her.\n\n\nEdit:\nI'm also side eying where she tells you she was afraid of bringing it up to you because you would just justify it. In a good partnership you shouldn't be afraid to tell the other person about little things like this. I've been short with my husband and he's been short with me. We usually address it right away, it keeps resentment from building. Do you often dismiss her feelings? Are you often rude to her when you're frustrated?", "I'm torn. I wanna say ESH but I think there's a lot more going on that your side alone cannot provide. You sound overwhelmed and possibly overworked. I'm assuming she has a lot of trauma based on her \"shit-storm\" of an upbringing so her responses to certain reactions and tones are a product of that, but it sounds like she's working on it with the therapy.\n\n\nI don't like the way she said \"there is nothing I could do that could justify you speaking to me that way\" because it sounds like she's immediately dismissing you and absolving herself of any past, present, or future wrongdoing. But it also sounds like she's trying to figure out how to stand up for herself. Maybe this wasn't the best situation to do that but idk.\n\n\nBased on this post, I don't think your response was that bad. It sounds like it came from a place of stress and burnout. However, she had such an extreme reaction to it and the fact that she felt afraid to bring it up is making me hesitate. Y'all need to sit down and have a serious talk.", "Nta. She needs a better therapist", "NTA\nYour wife needs to read the room. Choose an appropriate time to ask such questions which require explanations.  \nYou could have apologised for your tone but the content was fine.\nShe is finding ways to use the tools she has learnt at therapy but applying them takes time to get it right.

Without \"I feel\", it ends up just being her putting words and thoughts into OP's mouth/head and giving them no productive way to respond... which is exactly what happened. She had already decided that the only \"correct\" response was an enthusiastic apology from OP and was not actually willing to engage in a mutual discussion. \n\nAnd while yes, perhaps she did deserve an apology, she went about it so aggressively that she ended up backing OP into a corner, which isn't actually productive. Had she gone about it differently, OP probably would have told her that they had just been feeling overwhelmed and frustrated by the kid situation and hadn't meant to snap at her, and was sorry for the tone that they used (I assume this due to OP's open acknowledgement that they *did* snap at her a bit and respond in an overly exasperated tone).", "Ok so what if she didn't communicate her feelings in the least confrontational way possible. Did therapy teach you to use a rude tone with your partner? Did it teach you to blow their request out of proportion? She literally just said she found his tone rude.

You have a very very good understanding of effective and purposeful communication", "therapy taught me to use \u201ci/me\u201d statements, not \u201cyou\u201d statements. so:\n\n\u201ci feel like your tone earlier wasnt appropriate, it made me feel bad, i need you to be more thoughtful in the future\u201d is all fine, because thats talking about her feelings, her wants and her needs. this is constructive communication and will have a positive impact with a positive outcome. \n\n\u201cyou cant ever talk to me like that, nothing you can say will justify your tone, youll have some justification so i dont even wanna talk about this\u201d is not constructive, it is in fact destructive and completely goes against what any therapist would advise. this puts all of the burden on OP, attacks him preemptively, and puts him in a position where he cant even explain himself as he\u2019s already been put in the position of \u201cthe bad guy\u201d. this is not communication, this is assertion and will have a negative impact with a negative outcome. \n\nshe didnt express how she felt, she told OP what he can and cannot do in a way that isn\u2019t reasonable. \u201cyou can\u2019t let your frustration show no matter the circumstances because i dont like it, and nothing you can say will change my perspective\u201d is **not a healthy message**. does his tone affect her? sure, but thats part of life when you live with someone, especially when there are kids involved. there are healthy and constructive ways to deal with this, and immediately being on the attack is not it. OP had his hands full and was trying to deal with the kids, and he said something in a less than amazing tone, which is not great. but that doesnt justify her response, like at all.", "Ma\u2019am I don\u2019t know who you are but you\u2019re making quite a lot of assumptions there. \n\nIf your partner says to you \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t talk to me like that, you did this, you did that\u201d How would you respond?\n\nI\u2019d much rather communicate with my partner by saying \u201cI felt hurt by your tone\u201d", "She was demanding an apology, which I\u2019m sure didn\u2019t feel good to be on the receiving end of when you\u2019re feeling attacked.", "Or it could have been just short. You don\u2019t know either", "I highly recommend apologizing sooner than later about invalidating her feelings. You can tell her you need more time to process/think about the tone at dinner, but don't let her stew in having her first attempt to be vulnerable with you being met with sarcasm and condescension.", "You sound like a great partner  Your behaviour and response are perfectly understandable  As you say your wife is super sensitive because of past trauma \nTherapy is probably helping her to express her feelings and you get a raw deal this time with unreasonable expectations. \n\nIt was explained to be as expecting unreasonable responses from ordinary people. (Compensation and reassurance for previous let downs).\nWith your good attitude and if you can stick with it, I am sure things will eventually improve. And you will both be able to laugh about it!", "Haha, this is a dangerous sub for totally addressable issues - I actually generally don't disagree with the way people leap to \"leave them\" because it's often really toxic, but people will absolutely blow it out of proportion.\n\nPersonally I think it's close to NAH, since it's reasonable for you to be snappy, and it's reasonable to shut down when your partner uses a harsh tone with you. The follow up sounds like not great communication from both sides.\n\nAn external moderator could definitely help here! Regardless, you're not an arsehole.", "You think naming the behavior he engaged in is wrong? \n\nNext time a man calls me a crazy b word on the street I'll gently inform him that I feel hurt when profane words are used against me. \n\nYou don't know what she was doing, cooking, cleaning etc. \n\nYeah she meant there's no excuse, it's literally never inappropriate to offer a sincere apology when you disrespect your partner. Why is that a hard concept for so many people", "This was incredible insight! I could read this reply 10x over and probably will", "She literally didn't ask for an apology based on the post. She told him how she felt about the way he spoke to her and said that she was afraid to bring it up to him. That's clearly an indicator of past trauma. She did not ask him to get on his knees and grovel - she told him how it made her feel and that it was hard for her to tell him that. And he then goes off on her. No wonder she was scared to talk to OP if that's the response she got.  YTA", "She opened the \"conversation\" by declaring him wrong by her decree, and herself the victim.  That's complete bad faith.  That is \"poisoning the well.\"\n\nIt looks like all she's learning to do in therapy is to manipulate.  OP needs to be on guard against attempts by her to set him up.", "Can you read? Apparently not.", "Maybe learn to read", "It sounds like his wife is going through some stuff, but it doesn't excuse her behavior. She's been giving him the silent treatment since dinner, and now he's supposed to be excited that's she's ready to talk to him now?", "Only person raging is you so far", "im glad you think so! ive been studying social sciences (psychology, sociology, and criminology all separately) for six years now, and im currently studying to become a psychiatrist (only on my bachelor\u2019s right now, but still) so im glad i come across as insightful. hopefully its an indicator that ill actually be successful in my career plans lol!", "But the problem was, she didn\u2019t tell him how it made her feel. So he probably didn\u2019t know how he was supposed to respond- because it wasn\u2019t a conversation at that point. She was telling him what he did was definitively wrong and I can\u2019t imagine that felt great to just sick back and listen to. That\u2019s an argument that could\u2019ve gone on for a long long time had he not cut it short.", "I don\u2019t know, when it comes to people I love, I don\u2019t want them to feel hurt on account of me, ever, even if it was unintentional and/or misinterpreted. So, in a situation like this, I would absolutely say something like, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to snap at you. I was feeling pretty overwhelmed, and I\u2019m sorry I upset you.\u201d It costs me nothing, it makes my intentions clear, and it makes the person I love feel a lot better."]}
