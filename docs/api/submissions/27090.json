I know that joke was mild, and I'm not personally offended by swearing, but some people are. It's ok to joke around if it's about something relevant but even then you're taking a risk because humor is extremely subjective. Kindness is enough. People will appreciate that.

But it is a little weird considering I don\u2019t think that joke would just slide into any conversation, making it awkward and a bit corny. As others have said too, it makes it feel awfully performative for your waiter because I doubt they actually find that funny (unless their humour is extremely undeveloped and dry\u2026 sorry). It\u2019s much better to try and converse, simple things like asking how their day has been, If it\u2019s been busy, what they like to order, and a lot of the time these surface level questions lead to something more. A simple good convo is enough to bring a smile to someone\u2019s face and have them remember it for a long time. Pair that with a lasting impression and sweet hearted compliment it is much more natural than randomly throwing a joke like that out there. Again, you have good intentions and if ultimately you like doing those little jokes well just do them.
