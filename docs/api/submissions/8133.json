I watched everyone after me getting drunk off their butts, but there was this 80-pound girl who I started getting worried about. I wasn't experienced with drinking, so I asked some of her closest friends if she was okay. None of them cared that she'd slid onto the ground in the middle of the party and wasn't responsive.

I ended up taking her to the hospital, where she got her stomach pumped. \n\nAt the time, I was floored her close friends hadn't been worried because the hospital staff was. But when I got more experienced with drinking years later, I got even more pissed. Her friends should have been scared. In all my \"partying\" that was the drunkest I'd ever seen a person.
