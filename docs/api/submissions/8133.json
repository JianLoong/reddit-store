He should of guided you and help you at first and if that didn\u2019t work then ambulance or er. Which ever your choice. Also as one pot smoker to maybe another. Be careful with mixing your prescription meds with weed. Especially if the first time smoking. Usually the first few months up to a year of smoking can produce a paranoia.
