Even if you were feeling effects of an overdose, there are things (I don't remember if it's an actual law or not) which protect another person in the event of calling for an ambulance. We want people to be calling for help and not be concerned about getting into trouble for drugs. Your friend is a selfish ah for not calling. He may have been under the influence as well but his actions showed how good of a friend he is to you. You have every right to be mad at him. Personally I would walk away from this friendship as he doesn't sound supportive at all.", "NTA\n\nYour friend was right there and more concerned about being arrested for having weed then the fact that you could have died right there and then. \n\nBut he do realize that by refusing to call 911 when you asked him to do so that could actually led him to be arrested for attempted murder to hide the fact that he has weed in his possession?\n\nIf the weed is discovered in your blood is the hospital responsible to call the police for you having weed in your blood? If that is the case what will you do then lie to cops for someone that where willing to let you die to hide his illegal possession of weed if your words and his reaction is anything to be concerned about?\n\nEdit: I seriously suggest you break up your friendship with him, since he cared more about the weed then you his supposed friend crying for help in your dying breath!", "NTA. I know it was \"Just weed\" but he gave you drugs and when you had a bad reaction he'd rather risk you die than risk jailtime for the EMTs coming and saving you.

If your friend was a danger to anyone they would report that but short of that they only want to help the patient.", "NTA.  He is not your friend.  His behavior was totally inexcusable.

They literally didn't care you were potentially having an OD or heart attack. Cut them tf out.", "NTA! So called friend? Completely TA!", "NTA! You know him better than we do and know the issues he has that could be affecting his behavior, but what he did was horrible. Honestly, it seems you should distance yourself from him if you don't want to completely cut him out of your life.", "NTA. That's just scary.", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s no coming back after something like that. If I tell my friend to call emergency because I think I might be dying and their reaction is \u201cno way!
