Recently I noticed that the nurses from 3pm to 11pm had been leaving with foil wrapped bundles for the past several days. At first I thought maybe they were ordering food to share with the others on their shift or maybe they were doing some sort of \u201cpotluck\u201d thing amongst themselves or something.\n\nWell, the last time they were leaving I noticed a huge container that had (by the label) contained a pumpkin cheesecake. I mean, like a novelty type thing, it was giant and obviously expensive. They were being careful with their wrapped bundles so they wouldn\u2019t squash them and each had very large foil wrapped portions.\n\nI said \u201cWow, which one of y\u2019all brought that, I\u2019m jealous!\u201d The nurse smiled and said that a patient\u2019s family member had been bringing in food and treats every afternoon for the past week for them.\n\nI was a bit surprised because I thought they might have meant for all shifts to share, it was a huge cheesecake and it also explained why every nurse/CNA had been leaving with food to take home every evening.\n\nI told her that, not in an angry way but I said \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you leave any of this stuff for us? I\u2019m sure they meant for us to all share!\u201d She laughed and said \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even know you guys, she\u2019s only coming to visit in the afternoon, why would she bring you guys anything?\u201d I told her (staying polite but starting to feel angry) that we provided care to her family member also and she\u2019s obviously bringing enough for all three shifts! \n\nAt this point all four of them were at the nurses\u2019 station ready to go home and I flat out asked if they could each leave a piece for the three of us.  They looked at me like I had farted in church. They said that if it were meant to be shared she would have brought three. I pointed out that they were taking home more than enough for all three shifts (their bundles were larger than their clipboards and had been every evening) and finally they left three slices (like 6 inches high and four inches wide, huge cheesecake) and I thanked them, we ate it during the night and it was delicious, they all still had big bundles to take home).\n\nNow I feel weird though, they were noticeably annoyed with me, my shift coworkers said I was right but they obviously felt otherwise. AITA?\n\nETA: when it was my birthday one of my night shift coworkers brought in a big birthday cake for me and I left the remainder of it for day shift (and evening shift) to enjoy. I cannot fathom taking the leftovers from something brought by a family member for what (I assume) is in gratitude of the care their family member is receiving, a token of appreciation. We give that care as well.\n\nETA 2: the cheesecake came  presliced with paper between each slice, they weren\u2019t cutting off big slices or anything. More than enough for all three shifts even after they had eaten it, they could even have each taken a slice home and there would still be enough for us and day shift to enjoy.", "created_utc": 1667316150, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjbgf5/aita_for_asking_my_coworkers_to_share_what_they/", "score": 395, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When we went in for delivery, we took snacks for our nurses. We had a lot of food for all the shifts. The basket was full of snacks and drinks.

Why would someone be bringing so much food for only a few people?", "NTA\n\nI come from a family of care providers, most in a hospital environment. In the hospitals that don't prohibit receiving gifts like this (as some have now made rules for this very reason), it's an unwritten rule to share unilaterally with the *entire* team, regardless of shift. \n\nWhat those 3 did was an asshole move.

Most selfish people don\u2019t enjoy when others notice and even enjoy it less when you highlight it.

The patient knows you and you take care of their family member too.  Some people are just piggish.", "Nta. Who knows what the person's thoughts were...do these nurses have esp? It's really selfish of them to take home what was left after they ate and not just leave it for the other shifts.", "The day shift workers sound horrible. Even if the food was meant for that specific shift, they are thumbing their noses at the people who are there during the hardest hours.

They wanted pizzas delivered at noon for the daystaff and 8pm for the nights so they would be fresh for each shift. The pizza place accidentally delivered the night shifts pizza at 530 and the daystaff proceeded to take whole pizza out to their cars to bring home before shift change. They left and entire floor of night workers with one cheese pizza with three pieces missing.

They let their bosses take care of it and it was resolved along with an email to everyone about the problem. Some people just have no home training.", "NTA. They were being rude and greedy.

But it was their choice, their actions.", "NTA. They were being greedy shits, and calling them on it was appropriate. I'm rather disgusted by the whole group. I've been the person bringing stuff while my grandmother was in palliative care, and it was never meant for just one person or shift.

NTA", "NTA I\u2019d bring this to HR. If I was a family member I would expect the food to be shared across all shifts because all of you are taking care of the family member.

The Am shift may not be feasible for them to come and visit and nether is the graveyard shift. Let\u2019s also consider actual \u201cvisiting\u201d hours. I\u2019m assuming your facility is like most places where visiting hours don\u2019t start till after a certain time and ends before a certain time. So just because 2nd shift is prime visiting time doesn\u2019t mean that they are the only nurses who count! It just means that they are most likely to be around when treats are given.

Presumably you are also caring for this person\u2019s family member.", "NTA \u2014 I work in a nursing home and we are not allowed to get gifts from families unless it\u2019s a gift for everyone.

Because it was a big cake, it should be shared between everyone. If it was small it could be assumed it was for a couple nurses personally, but it wasn\u2019t small and other people care for the patient as well. Also whether it was intended for one mmm a couple or not, you are all coworkers and all (presumably) do a similar job and should share amongst yourselves anyways. If someone gave me a gift for doing my job, I would share it with everyone else who also has my position if there was enough.", "NTA.. the heck, we only have two shifts at my hospital but we always are only taking our share. Never anymore.

These were people who were sufficiently important to me that I visited them every day, and sometimes stayed in their room overnight. Every time I went to the hospital, I took a large container of cookies I'd baked, which I left at the nurses' station with a note that it was from the family or friend of the patient in room ###, as a thank-you for taking such good care of the patients. I always took enough cookies to cover all the shifts for that day, precisely because I intended those cookies to be for *everyone* working on that ward \u2013 every shift, every day, nurses and patient care techs and physical therapists and physicians and housekeeping and anyone else who worked there, including the people who weren't involved in treating the patient I knew. I would have been absolutely furious if I had discovered that people were doing what OP's coworkers did! \n\nNTA, but OP's coworkers are huge ones.", "NTA. I\u2019m an RN and it\u2019s common courtesy to try and leave some of the goodies for the next shift.

Thank you for all your hard work!!", "NTA but your coworker sure are. When I volunteered with the my local citizens police academy, even though we had our potluck, treats and parties for the officers during day time hours, we always made sure all three shifts could come or had something to eat. Just because 3rd shift didn\u2019t start until late doesn\u2019t mean they should be left out and they still help the community too. If the family intended only for those staff to have it, it wouldn\u2019t have been so big or had so much left over.", "NTA. I\u2019ve taken food for nurses in a hospital and the expectation is that it is for everyone on the floor/caring for the patient, not just the staff who is there at the moment (otherwise night shift would never get treats because it\u2019s not visiting hours!!!).", "Former long term care nurse here. Large gifts of food like that are meant to be shared among all the staff, all shifts.

I\u2019d never even think of doing that.\n\nWhen the nurse said that if they wanted the other two shifts to have some she\u2019d have brought three all I could think of was- they brought three shift\u2019s worth of goodies!\n\nETA: typo", "It\u2019s evening shift (3pm to 11pm) but thank you and yes we work hard, we have more patients each than any other shift and the responsibilities are greater. :) I work 11pm-7am.\n\nETA clarification", "Don\u2019t you love having more patients and all of the paperwork and doctorless admits then have any extra tasks pushed onto the night shift because we are the ones who have \u201cextra time\u201d to accomplish them?", "Drama around free food among healthcare workers is a common occurrence. I worked as hospital pharmacist and we occasionally got free food, not as much as the nurses though. Every, single, time some rude sod would cut extra for their SO or their kids to take home. Screw the 2nd shift (me) or the night people. We were left with 2 stale brownies while the selfish ones sauntered out with half a cake.", "We really are but sometimes I think people believe we are sitting around playing cards all night without realizing that we give night and morning meds, take the emergency admissions, handle sleep/pain/nausea at all hours (more patients each than in any other shift), audit the charts and enter new orders, prep for mornings, and audit the narc cart. We are always busy.", "I wouldn't. That would be a fast way to find a \"no accepting treats from clients\" rule imposed, I bet.", "If I did I think it would look petty and might lead to me looking like a toddler (\u201cthey aren\u2019t sharing!\u201d kind of vibe)lol\u2026", "God bless people like you, and trust me it\u2019s always appreciated\u2026 it\u2019s such a thorn in my paw because when my grandmother was in the hospital (different one) I did the same thing with brownies. And I would have been upset as well. I just can\u2019t believe the idea that it is meant only for them. It\u2019s not that I expect stuff for doing my job but it\u2019s always a nice pick-me-up and j believe she meant it for all of us\u2026", "Thank you for all of yours! You would be perfect because you know we aren\u2019t sitting around twiddling our thumbs.", "That\u2019s what got me! The nurse said that if the family member had meant it to be shared with the other two shifts then she would have brought three cheesecakes but the family member obviously bought one huge one big enough for all three shifts\u2026", "We very rarely are thought about. But we exist and we work very hard.", "It\u2019s like we are the invisible shift.. maybe that\u2019s why they call it \u201cgraveyard\u201d shift. The only ones there at night are the ghosts.", "The night shift will be so happy to hear that!", "That guy is a definite AH for that, I\u2019m sorry!", "That\u2019s what I wanted to say pretty much verbatim.\n\nETA: typo", "I wish that every year they were required to spend a shift at night. It would get rid of the whole \u201clots of free time to work this in\u201d vibe that is such a vicious rumor.", "I\u2019ve never met or talked with her, she comes to visit during the afternoons and I don\u2019t come in until 11pm. Talking with her isn\u2019t an option. These slices were huge, about nine or ten inches long, three or four inches wide and like six inches high. It was more than enough for all three shifts to share and I believe it was meant to be shared\u2026 but I might be wrong.", "So you only value the staff you see? You do know that the staff you see isn't there 24/7, what do you think happens to your Grandma when they're not on shift...she just takes care of herself? That's a bit short sighted not to want to have the treats to ALL STAFF who are taking care of your grandma.", "I just don\u2019t want tension in the air\u2026 the other night shift staff weren\u2019t around to either back me up or tell me I was wrong but later on they appreciated what I did.", "So only the day nurses mattered to your mother?", "I sleep from about noon until 8pm, and they come after work in the afternoon (not sure what time) and it would be very weird for me to come in and try to catch them there.", "I think the sad thing is that it never even occurred to them that they should share it. The sadder thing is that if day shift pulled the same thing on them they would be the first to complain.", "This is a completely different situation.  A family providing food for nurses involved in their family members care includes all the nurses involved in the care, not just one shift. The nurses on a different unit or \u201cteam\u201d would not be. OP works on the unit or \u201cteam\u201d just on a different shift.", "Seriously, this is an admin issue. How many other 'value adds' has the day shift plundered and hidden evidence of. This is seriously messed up. This is extremely petty. NTA OP.", "NTA at all, but you should check with your Compliance department to make sure you can accept gifts of that value. (A store-bought cake of that size likely exceeds the government-regulated value of gifts that can be accepted.)", "In most healthcare facilities, there are no night time visiting hours, so families rarely have interaction with night shift staff. You wouldn't want the night nurse to call you at midnight just to say, \"Hi, I'm Debbie, and I'll be taking care of your mom until 7am!\" Families usually only speak with night nurses when there is a crisis. But the night shift people are equally responsible for patient care.", "Most hospitals have visiting hours ending at 8pm so unless the family members were staying overnight, they likely never met.", "I know where I work visiting hours are over after 8pm so maybe op only ever works the 11pm shift. \nAlso NTA night shifters can miss out on a lot of goodies :(", "I don\u2019t know if this is just covid rules, but at my dads recent stay, there are no visitors during the shift change, which was (I think) 7-8pm. I had to wait outside when I was picking up my mom bc no one couod enter who wasn\u2019t already there", "I work 11pm to 7am, I don\u2019t interact with the family. Evening shift is 3pm to 11pm and they are the ones there when the family member comes to visit.", "I called the hospital in the middle of the night many times to check on a family member and the nurses always took the time to explain how my family member was doing. I didn't see the nurses working overnight but they were wonderful about answering questions and offering reassurance. This was really shitty behavior of the staff who was there when the food came in.", "Yeah, they are selfish AHs, but I try to give people the benefit of the doubt sometimes. Not sure why .", "Exactly! Their logic is so flawed...", ".... that's just disturbing, if they're that selfish and petty then it means that they aren't really trustworthy, and these are people trusted with medical care!", "DSP...", "Yup. I worked at an ER and management a HUGE deal about a code that was run in under 10 minutes for the first time. Which is good for the patient. Except night shift had done it in 8 minutes the week before........and there was no acknowledgment.", "Well, they're already making sure no one else gets treats anyways. You know this isn't going to make them straighten out. They'll just make sure to remove any evidence before shift change from now on.", "Well it's not as if  they're getting any treats now *shrugs*", "Unfortunately that\u2019s all too true.", "I have long joked that I firmly believe in the power of bribery through baked goods. More seriously, I believe that the people (in ALL the different jobs) who work in hospitals deserve to be thanked for the work they do, but since I can't realistically thank them all personally, a large batch of homemade cookies is a reasonable substitute.", "The fact they did it multiple days in a row is telling. I\u2019d personally say something to a supervisor but that\u2019s just me. In situations like this where someone brings a shareable \u201cgift\u201d like food, they should be sharing with other shifts before taking anything home with them. Otherwise, morale is affected when the shifts being left out continuously get nothing and greedy people like this get everything just because they happen to work at the better time.", "The two shifts are just the 7 of you? \n\nIf yes they sound kinda selfish", "That\u2019s my thought as well. Either they were purposely bringing in enough for all three shifts or they were bringing enough for 3-11 to take some home to their families. I doubt that was said to them though because I feel as if one of them would have said so when I questioned their not letting us have some. If it were me I would have stuck it in the fridge for all three shifts.\n\nETA: typo", "That's not what I'm saying at all, I value every single person who made an impact on my grandma's care. \n\nI am simply saying that I have made treats and passed them off to the specific people that I know because I know what they like and because they have been good *to me*. People who I encounter often have to deal with the hard emotions that family members are encountering and it is often me extending a gesture of good will to the people who have watched me break down sobbing because of how tough the situation had been and given me a hug, a tissue or coached me through what was happening with my grandma.\n\nI've certainly brought in things for all staff but its not always the focus of bringing in treats.", "I totally get that and it's not comfy when there is some tension. \n\nI would maybe just talk to the day staff and try and clear the air. You *do* care for the patient and offer the same quality of care to the patient themselves and that unless the family is bringing it specifically for that section of nursing staff, then it should be available to share.", "The night nurses sucked. They got complained about all the time. My mom would be in soiled clothes and the floor would have waste on it. Blood on the sheets and floor. The morning crew would have to clean up everything and we're wonderful with her but she'd get chafed and was always really thirsty by the time we rolled in at 7. My mom was non verbal and couldn't walk in the end so it was actually abuse. There were times we'd get there at shift change and have to clean up after her ourselves (which I gladly did for my mama but she NEVER should have been like that). When my mom passed the day nurses sent a card to our family. The night nurses told us we need to move her to hospice because she was too much to deal with. As I was looking for a nurse one morning to get clean towels I found her taunting an older gentleman by putting his food up to his mouth but then pulling it back telling if he's hungry he'll feed himself and laughing. I asked her WTF she was doing and she told me her shift ended 2 hours ago and this isn't her job. So yes to answer your question only the day shift nurses mattered to me and I'm happy 2 night nurses were fired.", "A family member who according to OP pre sliced the cake for the nurses herself", "Doesn't change my answer.\n\nNo direct permission, no entitlement. It's that simple.\n\nThe afternoon shift sounds sketchy about permission, if it's not clear and unless you can get directy clarification, it's not yours. If the person is bringing food and not giving directions on how to share, \"make sure everyone who cares for my loved one gets some/a piece/whatever\", and is leaving it up the shift recieving to share, that shift is allowed to share however they want too.\n\nThe fact this needs to be explained to people who are assumed to adults is ridiculous.", "It kind of depends on where in the hospital this took place. When my husband was doing inpatient chemo (24/7 for 5 days in a row), I would visit during regular hours each day until his last day of chemo, when depending on what time of day he had started, i would stay until he finished his last bag of chemo and could be discharged to come home, which could be until 11 pm, midnight, and sometimes later. It was usually the same overnight nurse who would be monitoring his last bag of chemo, would contact the IV team well in advance to come and deaccess his port, and would have all of his discharge papers signed off on, prescriptions called in, etc so we could leave as soon as he was done. If I had brought food for the nurses that took care of him, and night shift nurses got shafted by day shift, i would have been pissed.", "You guys do realize the patient interacts with all the shifts?? Just because a family member brought in the food doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t know about other shift staff", "My mom was a night nurse. I've spent nights in the hospital with my dad. It depends on the facility. (I spent nights at the hospital with my husband the last time he had a four day stay.)", "Right. So maybe OP can leave a note with the patient for the family member to please do not bring in any more food for ONE shift \"as there has been complaints from other members of the care team not being able to share in the gratefulness you feel\". \n\nMaybe it really is supposed to be shared among all members of the team but the family bringing it in does not know that the afternoon shift is being greedy AF.", "You are right. Covid changed the landscape.", "The nurses at the hospital woke me up and asked me to please get my SIL out of their hair. I was so embarrassed and then I had to hunt her down and tell her to knock it off.", "I guess night shift is the same everywhere.. if you do anything extra it isn\u2019t appreciated because we have all that \u201cextra time\u201d to do it, if we are slammed and we are not able to do something then we are lazy and you can bet there will be a note from the floor supervisor complaining.", "Yes, four on 3-11, three on 11-7.", "Agreed", "Pre solving doesn't indicate who to share it with though.\n\nI can slice a pizza into 8 peices, if I'm sharing with one other person, the remaining 6 silces do not automatically belong to anyone else present, or present in the future. Unless I give direct permission, or instructions to do so.\n\nIf the person is handing over the food to the after shift, and making it clear they must share with everyone who cares for their loved one, the afternoon shift can dispurse the food how they please.", "Yeah I\u2019m sure the patient fully intends for said nurses to take extra slices to their families. That seems more probable. /s", "No. OP should not leave a note saying that! JFC. This person has a sick/injured family member. \nThey don\u2019t need \u201cmanaging break room snacks\u201d added to their plate. Nor should they buy 3 times more food (afternoon shift would likely just take 3 times more anyway).", "Classic reddit coming up with the shittiest advice that would not work in the real world. Tomorrow on AITA: \"a nurse wrote me a note that I didn't bring in enough cheesecake even though I brought in a giant one, AITA?\"", "Man, even if she didnt mean to share it, if they have enough to bring home even after sharing, they should just do it. Unless you guys have been awful to them in the past or whatever, i dont see why, other than selfishness, they wouldnt ?", "We\u2019ve never been anything but friendly, as well as professional. That\u2019s one of the reasons I was so surprised. I even left the rest of my birthday cake for them before. (Had them each take some home, there was more than enough birthday cake left for our shift and left the rest for day shift to enjoy.)", "Yeah ok f them then lmao"]}
