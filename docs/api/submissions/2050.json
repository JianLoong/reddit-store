If they were not family they would never speak, and neither of them cope well with it well. in the past I've stood up for my wife every time my mom was catty.\n\nMy wife is currently pregnant and my mom is planning a wedding, so great more tension. Now i fully acknowledge I fucked up here but my wife has been feeling pretty down lately  and I felt she needed to get out. I pressured my mom to take her wedding dress shopping because my wife loves fashion and I'm an idiot who thought maybe they could bond. Also my wife really really wanted to go. She loves clothes and wanted to go to the restaurant they were going to. My mom reluctantly agreed and again I'm a huge idiot.\n\nSo they went and my mom came out in a dress and my wife just began sobbing. Being pregnant she cries very easily these days and she was mortified but just couldn't control it. My mom took it badly which i understand, but my mom began telling everyone there that see my wife just hates her, she is crying because she wants my mom to die alone, etc. Then my mom apparently giggled and a few other people laughed. My wife was humiliated and left in an Uber.\n\nmy wife explained to me that she was just jealous of the dress/wedding/how thin my mom is as my wife feels like shit. She said she missed being a bride as she loved it so much, and just seeing my mom made her feel worse. I told her I totally get it and we all have irrational moments sometimes, but I can see why my mom took it the way she did and I think my wife should apologize and explain. She asked if I was going to make my mom apologize and I said no, as I can understand why she would think that and I think the laughter was because she was uncomfortable.\n\nMy wife blew up and said I was being a mama's boy and trying to shame her for her feelings. She said my mom owes her an apology and until i \"get my head out of my ass and tell her that\" she won't be apologizing. I feel horrible right now.", "created_utc": 1668186590, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysgicj/aita_for_asking_my_wife_to_apologize_to_my_mom/", "score": 256, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stop it.", "YTA, and I have a hard time believing you don\u2019t know it.\n\n> I can see why my mom took it the way she did\n\nYou can?  Because I think *most* people would interpret sobbing at a bride\u2019s entrance as a compliment on how beautiful she looks, or having generally sentimental feelings about weddings.  Especially if the person sobbing has a reason to be feeling sentimental in general\u2026like, I don\u2019t know, being pregnant.\n\nBut okay.  For whatever reason, you and your mom can assert with confidence that this was definitely an insult (in which case I really *don\u2019t* know why you asked that your wife be included in the first place,  but whatever).  In what universe does that justify your mom and her squad\u2019s prolonged mean girl attack, much less mean she doesn\u2019t owe an apology for *that?*", "YTA, and that's a HARD YTA.\n\nAnd it's completely laughable that you are claiming to be logical and put what was right over emotions.  If you are *actually* gullible enough to believe that your mother really thought that your wife was crying because she wanted her to stay single and alone, then you would be the perfect partner to help get a trunkbox of money out of Nigeria.\n\nYour mother knew FULL WELL that your wife was not thinking that.  She saw an opportunity when your wife was vulnerable, and she took it.\n\nYour wife owes your mother nothing.  You owe your wife a HUGE apology, along with some flowers and candy, and you do need to deal with your mom.", "YTA. You gotta know that, right? I can\u2019t believe people even have to explain that you. Wow.", ">She asked if I was going to make my mom apologize and I said no, as I can understand why she would think that and I think the laughter was because she was uncomfortable.\n\nYour wife doesn\u2019t want an apology for your mom *thinking* that she hates her. Your wife wants an apology because your mom went out her way to humiliate and ridicule her. And if your mom\u2019s laughter was out of discomfort it would of came when your wife started crying *before* she started to humiliate your wife. But it came after, makes it pretty obvious she was laughing *at* your wife. And you have the audacity to 1\u2022try to justify and brush off your mother\u2019s behavior and 2\u2022 demand your wife apologize. YTA", "Wait excuse me, you want your pregnant wife to apologize for.. crying? For being emotional while pregnant.. you are actually asking her to apologize for that? Meanwhile your total AH mom made those comments? \n\nYou are entirely ass backwards and YTA. So is your mom.", "YTA. The fuck is she gonna apologize for? Crying while pregnant? Seriously? \n\nMore importantly - choosing your mom over your pregnant wife, when your wife didn't even DO anything? When YOU pushed them both into hanging out when they didn't want to?", "Omg...... you really are an idiot. Sorry", "YTA, this whole situation was happened because of your bad decisions. You fix it if it matters so much. You really need to stop trying to force them to spend time together.", "YTA you pushed for this knowing they don\u2019t get along or even really like each other. if your wife needed to get out why didn\u2019t *you* take her out to do something? why send her with your mom who doesn\u2019t like her? and why do you want her to apologize, but not your mom who said terrible things about her to other people, right in front of her, and then laughed about it? that\u2019s pretty gross", "YTA, you forced two people who don't get along together in an effort to cheer your pregnant wife up?  YOU could have taken har out shopping or organized an outing with her girlfriends, anything with people who actually like her and care for her! Also, between your mother and your wife, always side with the wife or divorce her. A marriage where one part sides with their parents against the partner is doomed.", "YTA. You should have either stayed out of it completely or told BOTH of them to work towards a solution together. Way to throw your pregnant wife under the bus.", "YTA. Not for the apology thing but for forcing your mom to invite your wife when nowhere here does if state your wife actually cared about your moms wedding dress but just the exclusivity that your moms wedding dress shopping brought between the shop & the restaurant.", "YTA.\n\nThe crux of the matter is your refusal to admit that your mom and wife will never be friends. I understand how it must feel to be in the middle, but you don\u2019t have to be in the middle if you stop trying to force them together. Seems silly that two grownups can\u2019t just suck it up and be civil, but people are allowed not to like everyone.  Just so happens that the two people not liking each other are your mom and wife.\n\nYour insistence that your wife apologize and explain why she was crying is wrong. If your mother and wife had any kind of positive relationship, your mother would have asked what was wrong when she saw your wife crying. She would have been confused/concerned and not have automatically jumped to this terrible conclusion and then blurted it out in front of the whole store and embarrassed your wife. \n\nBut your mom doesn\u2019t care about your wife, she cares about herself.\n\nWhen someone is six months pregnant, the last thing they want to do is go shopping for and looking at clothes. Especially beautiful, elegant gowns that aren\u2019t designed for six-month pregnant bellies. I just\u2026 what were you thinking, OP? Literally no part of this plan was going to work, it was entirely doomed from the start. \n\nYour mother behaved badly, your wife is emotional, hormonal, and insecure, but neither of them would have been in this predicament if you hadn\u2019t tried to force them together. \n\nSo ya, YTA for forcing your wife to apologize when your mother behaved badly in a situation that you forced them both into.", "YTA. She cried because of hormones and being overly emotional. Your mom then takes this as an opportunity to play victim and publicly humiliate her. Your mom had at least one pregnancy so she should know. I've never been pregnant and I know just from knowing women who've been pregnant that this could happen during pregnancy. Then, to add insult to injury her husband wants her to apologize to the person who humiliated her? How do you not know you're wrong here?", "YTA\n\nCrying doesn\u2019t make you an asshole, but purposefully publicly humiliating and teasing someone to the point that they call a cab to leave? That DOES make you an asshole. It\u2019s truly that simple dude. Your mom is a shit stirrer and your wife did nothing wrong.", "YTA and so is your mom.  And she probably knows it, too.  (Giggled?!) Your wife is the one who deserves the apology, and from both of you.  But I doubt she get that...", "YTA. Your wife cried and your mother made up an entire narrative that was composed of obvious lies, and then laughed at your wife. Maybe your wife should apologize just so she could explain why she was crying, but your mother definitely needs to apologize too. More than your wife does. You say you\u2019ve always supported your wife in the past when it comes to your mother - so why are you stopping now?", "YTA\n\nYou're doing a great job of exemplifying why someone shouldn't marry a mama's boy.", "YTA. Why shouldn't your mom apologize? She knows your wife is pregnant, how hard would it have been to just tell people that was why she was crying? It's a lot more understandable than that dramatic load of crap she unleashed in a public venue.They both need to work at this and I think your mom failed that day.", "YTA - Your mom is also the asshole", "YTA For pushing your pregnant hormonal wife into a social situation with your mother when you know they don\u2019t like each other.\n\nEverything that happened was because you couldn\u2019t stop yourself from meddling and making a bad choice.\n\nApologise to your wife.", "YTA because you knew your mom didn\u2019t want your wife there.  It\u2019s sad your wife wanted to be there, but the whole thing seems like a mess.  Your mom also sucks, but I\u2019m assuming her thought process was \u201cI didnt want her here anyway\u201d", "YTA I'm sorry I'm trying to figure out why your pregnant wife would need to apologize for crying while pregnant? Your mom on the other hand has some things to apologize for.", "Yes YTA and i think she is not that wrong when she called you a mama's boy. Your wife didn't even have the time to explain anything before she got made fun of by your mother and insulted by her. There could have been plenty of reason for her to cry without it being insulting to your mom, yet your mother decided to insult her right behind. That is disgusting for your wife", "YTA Your mom was an asshole for her comment and behavior and for some reason you think your wife should be the one apologizing?? Are you ok?", "Your wife is right.", "YTA, your mom was awful and you want your poor wife to apologize to her? The hell...", "You , and your mom are the assholes  here .  Do not ever force your wife to apologize and not expect the same behaviour from your mother .", "ESH, what an exhausting family.", "YTA. You put two people together that never should have been. Especially after you said your wife cries easily. This is a big moment no matter how many times a woman has been married to pick a dress. Your wife ruined it for your mom out of jealously. Being pregnant isn\u2019t an excuse.", "YTA\n\nYour poor wife.", "YTA op, and it\u2019s genetics apparently. Your wife wasn\u2019t rude to your mom, she cried because she\u2019s pregnant and your mother didn\u2019t even give her a chance to explain. Instead she made fun of her and turned her into the villain of the situation somehow. She doesn\u2019t owe anything to your mom. \nAnd I honestly don\u2019t see this marriage working out unless you grow a pair and make it clear to your mom that she can\u2019t treat your wife like this. \nTrust me, it\u2019ll be worse when the baby is born. That is, if your wife doesn\u2019t file for divorce before that.", "YTA. \n\nYou suck for forcing two people who do not care for each other *at all* together on what was a special, important day for your mother where she should be surrounded by people who actually love her. \n\nYour wife... definitely doesn't suck for crying and I don't think she needs to apologize. But I also don't really love that your wife *really* wanted to go to the extent that she was willing to intrude on a day out with someone she hates so she could see some pretty dresses and get taken out to a restaurant on MIL's dime. Like... I don't know, but when I really don't like someone I don't accept nice things from them? Especially when they cost money? I don't think your wife sucks but that's a bit... IDK, it just feels really off to me. \n\nYour mom for making fun of your wife and making shit up about why she was crying. \n\nHonestly no one here comes off looking great, but I gotta go with you and your mom being the real assholes.", "YTA\n\nI actually have a feeling that you haven't actually ever stood up for your wife. The fact she called you a mama's boy and to \"get your head out of your ass\" shows that this probably isn't the first time she's had to deal with your mother being horrible.", "ESH\n\nIn order of biggest ah\n\n- you shouldn't have forced the issue\n\n- your wife really wanted to go? Oh damn sure her waterworks were about making it all about her\n\n- your mom shouldn't have done what she did", "You understood YTA, right?? Your wife din't doit nothing wrong, se cried, she dont doit nothing wrong. \nA person in a wedding or when buy wedding dress can cry because the bride its beatiful or because she is Happy, or in your wife case, because she is pregnant and the hormonas are afecting her. \nYour mother asume the wors and ATTAC your wife, and you don't defend her, you blame her and wanna make she apollogice with your mom?? \nPlease, ask forgive to your wife and Talk with your mother to explaint to her that what she doit to your pregnant wife wassnt ok. \nDont be a mama boy.", "Big surprise, momma\u2019s boy defending his mom and throwing his pregnant wife under the bus, even in the comments. YTA, it\u2019s insane you would even think to tell your wife to apologise. For what exactly? Crying, getting embarrassed, then being laughed out of the store?", "Complicated situation, but I'm going to go ESH.\n\nYour wife cannot control her hormones, but she does need to step up and, if not apologize to your mother, at least explain why she felt those emotions. It's likely your mom will be happy to hear that she actually loves the dress and was jealous of how good she looked in it\u2014and your wife sharing her genuine, positive feelings for your mother and her dress will be infinitely better bonding than any forced time together.\n\nYour mom was in the wrong in the way she reacted, and should not have smeared your wife in public like that based on an assumption, but it's not your job to make her apologize. She needs to realize she was wrong to jump to that conclusion and come to apologize on her own. Don't know why your wife wants a forced, disingenuous apology in the first place.", "YTA Your mom is clearly a bully who takes joy from making your wife feel uncomfortable and excluded.", "YTA \n\nSeems like your mom\u2019s head immediately went the route that would get her the most pity and make people shoot some daggers at your wife. It also seems like your wife went out there for a genuine good time and didn\u2019t realize what emotions would arise around wedding planning. I would have walked out too if someone made me feel like shit like that in front of others when that wasn\u2019t even your wife\u2019s intention, which your mom would know had she even bothered to ask your wife why she was crying.", "YTA.... And a momma's boy.\n\nI truly hope your wife opens her eyes and run.

And she cried, CRIED when she seen a beautiful wedding dress. When I was pregnant I cried because I seen a cute baby outfit. \n\nDid your wife say anything when she started crying? By your post I am going to assume she didn't . So your hateful mother seized an opportunity to humiliate your wife by assuming she was crying because she don't want her to be happy.

From what you said your mom didn\u2019t want to take your wife but your wife wanted to go so you guilted your mom into taking her when she didn\u2019t want to. It sounds like your mom was trying to avoid your wife in this situation completely. If they hate each other that much it is a possibility your wife only wanted to go to the dress fitting to cause some sort of drama that day, which she did. She also only wanted to go for food at a restaurant you guys can\u2019t afford to go to.  I have friends who have morbid senses of humor and what your mom said sounds like something they would say in an awkward situation to try to defuse it.\n\nYou know your mom and wife seriously hate each other and from your own comments your wife loves when your mom is unhappy. That\u2019s horrible, and knowing that why would you force them to spend time together. \n\nYou even said yourself your wife doesn\u2019t like not being the center of attention in a round about way and not being the center of attention at your moms wedding dress fitting made her cry. Pregnancy does not excuse your wife\u2019s behavior at all. Both you and her are TA.

If they were not family they would never speak, and neither of them cope well with it well. in the past I've stood up for my wife every time my mom was catty.\n\nMy wife is currently pregnant and my mom is planning a wedding, so great more tension. Now i fully acknowledge I fucked up here but my wife has been feeling pretty down lately  and I felt she needed to get out. I pressured my mom to take her wedding dress shopping because my wife loves fashion and I'm an idiot who thought maybe they could bond. My mom reluctantly agreed and again I'm a huge idiot.\n\nSo they went and my mom came out in a dress and my wife just began sobbing. Being pregnant she cries very easily these days and she was mortified but just couldn't control it. My mom took it badly which i understand, but my mom began telling everyone there that see my wife just hates her, she is crying because she wants my mom to die alone, etc. Then my mom apparently giggled and a few other people laughed. My wife was humiliated and left in an Uber.\n\nmy wife explained to me that she was just jealous of the dress/wedding/how thin my mom is as my wife feels like shit. She said she missed being a bride as she loved it so much, and just seeing my mom made her feel worse. I told her I totally get it and we all have irrational moments sometimes, but I can see why my mom took it the way she did and I think my wife should apologize and explain. She asked if I was going to make my mom apologize and I said no, as I can understand why she would think that and I think the laughter was because she was uncomfortable.\n\nMy wife blew up and said I was being a mama's boy and trying to shame her for her feelings. She said my mom owes her an apology and until i \"get my head out of my ass and tell her that\" she won't be apologizing. I feel horrible right now.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
