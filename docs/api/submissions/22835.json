Co-worker (A) is 20sF/white. \n\nRecently there was an issue with an employee who spoke to a customer who said he was happy he got to speak with \"an american\" and not \"an illegal\". The employee on the recorded line agreed with him and made jokes for an hour. \n\nThe employee was terminated and told his friends at work what happened, so word got around. \n\nThe company I work for is big on diversity and inclusion, so we had voluntary team meetings to talk. They offered any volunteer to speak on how they've dealt with any form of discrimination and to discuss how they felt at our company and if we need better practices in place. \n\nOne co-worker, P (30sM-black) has become a good friend and we've discussed how we both grew up in predominantly white spaces in small towns (less than 1k) in red states/areas. \n\nIn the meeting, P spoke about how he felt at prior jobs, his experiences, how he's been treated, and how he felt here. \n\nWhen finished, he said \"OP has a good perspective since she grew up similarly, but had different reactions from people as a WOC\"\n\nI'd didn't expect to be called on, but I decided to share.\n\nA spoke up when i finished: \"OP, that's a great story and all, but you have 0 right to comment on this since you're white and have only ever known privilege. You just want people to feel bad so you can play victim. Let real POC talk\"\n\nI asked A why she felt that way. She said it's clear I was white because of my name and voice, that I was just trying to get pitied and play a race card that I didn't have. She said I didn't sound like a black person and that my name is clearly a white name (it's a common name mostly seen with white women but not exclusive to them. As for my voice, I have a slight \"country\" twang. Imo a voice is just a voice and people sound how they sound. Her argument was that my voice didn't \"sound black\" and that you could tell other coworkers were actually black from their \"accents\") \n\nI told her those kind of remarks are racist and she's stereotyping POC by stating if they don't present one way, they aren't really POC. I told her that people of all races have different names and voices but it doesn't take away from who they are. \n\nThe sups then ended the meeting and immediately made a chat with themselves, me, A and 2 of the shift leads. They said to wait as we would all meet shortly. \n\nWhile waiting, I've had multiple co-workers message me saying that I was wrong to call A out and should have done it privately, that if A loses her job it's my fault and I should feel bad since she's a single mom and will lose everything. They told me to drop the \"black charade\" because my \"lying\" will cost A her job. \n\nI did not mean to get A in any trouble or cost her her job. I feel like what she said was uncalled for.

She should have stayed silent. It's really not that hard. Good for you for calling her out honestly. Good luck to you.", "NTA, A tried to call you out and called you \"priviledged\" so I don't see what the issue is for you to respond. You don't owe it to her to \"have done it privately,\" when she didn't give you that courtesy. Her comments could have put you into a bad light.\n\nINFO: Are the coworkers that upset all white?", "NTA\n\nbruh what. do not allow these people to shut you up like that girl. she was in the wrong, and although she wasn't purposely trying to hurt POC she did exactly that in her stereotyping. you just told her the truth in a straightforward way. if she gets fired:\n\n1. not your fault\n2. she should think about that before she tries to minimze the experience of other people that she wouldn't understand because she is literally WHITE\n3. not related but your other coworkers are part of the problem for taking her side over yours. her being a single mother has nothing to do with the fact that she was wrong in what she said.\n\ndo i think she should get fired: no. but did she deserve to get called out so that she understands what she said was wrong: YES !!!", "NTA - No, you absolutely should not ha e waited to talk to A privately. For many reasons.\n\nOne, A called you out in public and told you that you aren't a real POC. That right there is enough for disciplinary action. She had no right to do that. It's unprofessional, rude, and also should be against any company policy on how to interact with marginalized coworkers.\n\nLike, what if you were disabled and she said that you were faking it? I bet your coworkers wouldn't be texting you and blaming you after that.\n\nTwo, as a light-skinned POC myself (who also \"talks white\"), I often get this and it is infuriating. You're right that you cannot assume someone's race from their name or voice or even skin color. That's something A needs to learn and learn quickly, because it's a form of racism.\n\nBeyond that, why would she question you being POC when an obviously Black person called you a woc and turned the floor over to you? Did she think P was fooled by you or something? What the hell?\n\nThree, your coworkers are shady as hell for what they're trying to pull on you. If A loses her job, it's because of A's actions. You did not address A first, you only pushed back on what she said. A made an unforced error and you NOT speaking up would have been extremely bad for other POC in your company.\n\nIt's not your job to worry about A or her children or her job. You are not responsible for what happens to A based on what A did. Your role in life is not to cater to A's ignorance.\n\nI'd report each of the coworkers messaging you to management because that's workplace harassment and not okay.", "NTA. WTF? The people who are saying that you shouldn't have called A out are ridiculous. She PUBLICALLY, in a meeting, called you out as a liar and literally was racist in a meeting about inclusivity by saying you don't sound black. WHAT????!!!! I'm appalled. She deserved to be called out publicly. You weren't even rude, just stated facts. Le met guess, if I am black, have an accent and my name is Mary, I couldn't possibly be a POC? That's so dumb.\n\nIf she loses her job, it's on her and her ignorance. Not you!!", "What is with white people telling people they\u2019re white? My parents told me Meghan Markle was basically white and so wasn\u2019t allowed to complain about anything. Like wtf you crusty old lunatics. It\u2019s so tiring and offensive. NTA and she should be fired or disciplined.", "    A got her own ass in trouble, and the people telling you to basically let her spew racism are the \"Be the bigger person\" asses. Now, they are showing their racism by calling your bad experiences a \"black charde.\" Please save those messages just in case they come for you.\n  The real test will be how the company responds to A. Either they're 0 tolerance, or they're not. I bet that they just make her apologize, and you suck it up.  I'm a 60-year-old POC and dealt with this at work many times. At least in this day and age, you can speak out. NTA", "NTA  If A loses her job, it's her own doing. She chose to say the things she said, that's not your fault and not your responsibility.", "NTA at all. Good for you.", "I am a white passing POC. I would\u2019ve absolutely called A out immediately if she said anything like that to me. Your coworkers who are defending her are closet racists too. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You're biracial, not white. Everything you said is 100% true and A needs to listen.", "NTA if A behaves that way with you in a meeting with supervisors present she is the one to potentially get herself fired. Even if you didn\u2019t respond to her comment about your name and voice, management should have pulled her into the office anyway for her comments.", "What the hell. Definitely NTA!! She has no right to make any comment about your experiences as a poc. I wouldn't want to work alongside someone like that so good luck to her. She sabotaged her own job. I have the whitest name and an Aussie accent, but I look more Asian. To top it all off, I'm no stranger to racism. I'm just waiting for someone to come at me with that privilege bs.", "NTA - she made it public. You simply defended yourself. She is stupid and if she gets fired it\u2019s her own fault.", "NTA - This company shouldn\u2019t be surprised by the issues with racism, since it seems like a systemic issue.. \n\n\u201cBlack charade\u201d\u2026 That\u2019s a ridiculous comment, and this company sounds like an environment that you probably shouldn\u2019t be working in. \n\nYou should have 0 sympathy if that bigot loses her job.", "NTA, she tried to incorrectly call you out publicly and you just returned the favor. It\u2019s something that should be addressed to everyone there as I\u2019m sure certain others have the same point of view. I\u2019m black and grew up in predominantly white areas and was told soooo many times that people didn\u2019t think of me as black because I didn\u2019t dress a certain way, spoke well, was into different types of music, etc. it wasn\u2019t until I went to a historically black college that I got to see a larger variety of black people who had the same experience as me.", "NTA", "NTA - Sounds like A was virtue signaling and trying to make herself look woke by shaming someone else she presumed to be white for speaking during a conversation about race. She made an assumption and doubled down when called out, revealing her own racist stereotyping. You didn't do anything wrong by sharing your own experience and not letting someone else tell you how to feel/letting her racist remarks go unacknowledged.", "You 1000% are NTA. You did the right thing. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t even have had to be the person to address what she was saying. It was so obviously inappropriate that someone else should have shut it down immediately. It\u2019s management\u2019s job to protect you. I\u2019m a manager and the couple of times something racist has gone down while I\u2019m on a call, I check with my people to see if they would prefer to say something or if they would rather I do it, because I KNOW that nine times out of 10 if they say something, someone is gonna have an issue with their \u201ctone\u201d or some bullshit like that. Or say they should have brought it up another time. I hope you\u2019re keeping records of who is messaging you and pressuring you to drop the issue, too, because that\u2019s also a major issue.", "How dare she tell you that your identity is not right.  She should be sacked.  I am horrified.  NTA", "NTA. Forward all of those messages to HR. Clearly your company\u2019s diversity programs aren\u2019t working on the racists in your office.", "NTA. Why should racist bullshit get a pass? A and the coworkers deserve to be fired. You are not playing any card. You are speaking from experience.", "NTA\n\nthe number of white north americans and western europeans who have had the audacity to tell me what i am continues to be too fucking high.\n\nfor e.g. \"You are not Asian, you're Indian.\"\n\nfuck people like that. get fired get bent.", "NTA. white people (and many monoracial people in general) completely lack any kind of nuance regarding race\n\nI'm also mixed but majority white and very much white passing. i kind of get it when people doubt my heritage but the fact that anyone, let alone a mono white person, would go so far as to say that to a half mixed person under the guise of \"progressivism\" boggles my fucking mind. i don't know what mix you are but if you're half black then that's especially insane given the history of hypodescent (\"one drop rule\") surrounding that specific ethnic identity", "NTA.\n\nA is being double racist. First for believing that you must be POC to \"comment\", be a \"victim\" or experience anything but \"privilege\". Second, for then gatekeeping POC to be based off of her stereotypes about POC \"names\" and \"voices\".\n\nI don't think you were wrong for calling them out during the meeting. First off, they were the ones who aggressively, publicly called you out and tried to silence you, so it made sense for you to respond. Second, at a company that is \"big on diversity and inclusion\" having a meeting on \"diversity and inclusion\" where \"any volunteer can speak on how they've dealt with any form of discrimination and to discuss how they felt at our company and if we need better practices in place\"... that's literally the most appropriate context you could have possibly had that response in. The only way it's not appropriate is if the company was just having that meeting as a feel-good session and didn't want to actually hear about any wrongdoing which might be the case if their immediate reaction was just to end the meeting.", "ESH, including management who called this meeting. \n\nCalling a meeting to discuss racial issues- what could possibly go wrong!

All the people whining about A are white?", "NTA A Is racist and so are the ones telling you to \u201cdrop the black charade\u201d.", "NTA \n\nEven if you didn\u2019t say anything to A at all, your managers should have fired her anyway. I am shocked no one stepped in and shut that shit down! If she gets fired it\u2019s because she actually deserves it. Smh I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with this OP, no excuse for this type of behavior.", "What heck did I just read. NTA are female woman enough either? What insane thing to say Im actually flabbergasted.", "Holy shit.  A was sooooooooo far out of line.  A tried to embarrass you, and make you out to be a liar in front of everyone.  You explained in a much nicer way than I would have (I'm a white woman, but if someone blatantly tried to make me look like an asshole, I mean), that she was wrong.  Whatever consequences she has to deal with are on her.  I'd also report the messages from the rest of your coworkers who were taking her side.  They are very unprofessional, and very not accurate.", "NTA I would tell them would they like to be reported for harassment? Because you don't get to tell someone what they are and if you insist I can definitely make it happen.", "NTA.   I'm genuinely surprised the manager didn't pull her out of the meeting in the middle of her comment and suspend her pending investigation.", "It was a meeting to deal with just such issues.\n\nNTA\n\nI have many friends of diverse cultures and colors. At the end of the day, I cannot be them and know their experiences. A was totally out of line claiming you couldn't be a POC because of your name and accent.", "NTA. This is so absurd. She called you out first with her ignorant assumptions and you did nothing wrong.", "'aaaand what is the geographical location of India, pray tell?'", "The part I can\u2019t get over is that a Black co worker introduced OP specifically because she is also Black and A still was like \u201cyou know what I bet I know more than them\u201d that degree of arrogance doesn\u2019t make you a good co worker even before you get to the racism. Add the racism and yeah that\u2019s a fireable offense.", "Talk to HR", "Oh, 100%. Like, conditional whiteness is a thing! The cultural relativity of whiteness is a thing! But passing as white sometimes/when convenient to white people is just a different kind of shitty - that no white people get to have a fucking opinion on. \n\nIt's extra cool where there are literally no people left without white blood, and that's treated as meaning light-skinned people shouldn't care about their people's oppression, as if it's not a direct result of attempted and often ongoing cultural genocide.", "THIS. I'm also mixed race and get scared to talk about my experiences because i don't feel \"black\" enough, but I'm also not white enough to be treated like a white person. When you grow up having everybody - adults, children, everybody - constantly ask where you're \"really\" from and why you look the way you do, and why you don't look like your parents, and then have people turn around and act like you weren't othered your whole life baffles me.", "OMG I was thinking that too. I\u2019d white women have anything it\u2019s definitely the left over audacity from white men."]}
