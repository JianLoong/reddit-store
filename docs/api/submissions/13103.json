We both work full-time.  I work in sales and my wife is an anesthesiologist.  My wife has worked very hard to get where she is professionally and I am very proud of her.  But her work/family balance has been a point of contention between us for years due to how much time she has to dedicate to her job.  I am the primary caregiver to our kids by a large margin and do the majority of the housework that we don't pay to have done.  It doesn't help that the hospital my wife works at is constantly understaffed which causes my wife to have to pick up shifts to cover for people regularly.   She routinely works 60-hour weeks.\n\nFor months I have been telling my wife I need a break.  And not like a single night or weekend break, a legitimate break to refresh.  She pretty much gives me the same response every time.  \"Work is just really busy right now, but as soon as it settles down, you can schedule something.\"  \"I really want us to plan something as a family so we can all get a break.\"  \"So-and-so put in their 2-week notice so now we're understaffed again.\"  \n\nIt got to a point shortly after New Years that I had to invite my mom to come stay with us for a week because I was so overwhelmed and needed help.  My wife didn't like that because even though I told her I was going to have my mom come, she never \"officially ok'd it.\"  \n\nTwo weeks ago I brought up needing a break again and my wife told me that they are in the process of hiring more people and to just give her another month.  I told her I don't think I can wait that long and she told me she'll see what she can do.  But I've heard that before and decided to take matters into my own hands.  \n\nI first called my mom and asked her if she could come help with the kids again while I take a trip by myself.  She agreed right away.  I then started planning a 5-night trip for myself to a city that I have some friends in.  It's not a big family touristy spot so it's not like I'm going to Disney by myself.  But it will give me a chance to recharge and see some familiar faces.  \n\nWhen I told my wife about it she got defensive and pissed right away.  She told me I am being selfish for not including the whole family and for having my mom come stay with us without her approval.  I reminded her that I've been telling her I need a break for months and she said \"We all need a break, that's why I told you to wait.  Now you're getting a break and no one else is.\"  \n\nI told her that she doesn't need to do anything different when I'm gone.  I'm not putting anything extra on her plate because my mom can handle everything with the kids.  I told her I was tired of my needs getting pushed aside and being told to wait and wait and wait with no progress towards anything.\n\nShe told me I'm being selfish and it's not her fault that her job is so demanding.  She's not telling me to cancel the trip, but even if she did, I don't think I would.", "created_utc": 1679682241, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120t53t/aita_for_planning_a_vacation_for_myself_without/", "score": 204, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've been in need of a break for months and she kept telling me to wait, but nothing ever changed.  So, I finally just took it upon myself to book a trip for myself.

I think you should have stated I am going on a trip these dates are you interested in attending.  \n\nSecondly you aren\u2019t taking your children with you so your trip does increase the burdan on her.  You also booked your mom to come to take care of the kids without consulting your wife.  Just inviting your mom to take care of the kids is not something you do without a discussion.  \n\nThe non asshole way to handle this would again to be I am taking a trip because I need a break.  If you don\u2019t want to bring the kids then you can state that.  Then you would say my mom is available to support if you would like that.  How would you like to handle it?\n\nEssentially you are part of the problem because you took away all agency for how to deal with the situation rather than stating what you are doing and the potential options for your wife to choose from.  \n\nShe could go on the trip\nAccept your moms help\nOr look after the kids herself.\n\nThis way she has agency in her responsibilities that she can handle herself.

While it would be great to have a family vacation, it seems like you really needed some time for yourself to recharge.

He works 12 hour nights so is home during the day and he works 5 days one week 2 days the next. I am the primary parent, Primary house keeper, primary financial provider and financial handler. I do everything a wife typically does and most things a husband typically does. And the extent of my breaks are going our a few hours every 2 weeks IF my husband doesn't schedule something for himself (tattoo appointments, project around the house, etc.) My husband is not a great care taker for our children (will go outside for extended periods when he is supposed to watch them, will fall asleep when he is watching them, feeds them chips and gummy worms instead of meals, etc. I constantly explain I need him to step up so that even if I cant have a physical extended break (like your trip), I can at least get a mental one of not having to worry about children 24/7. Nothing changes. He will choose at the drop of a hat on my one day off (sunday is taken up with church so its basically useless to plan anything) to run out and do something on his own because when he asks what my plans are I don't have any at the moment. So he takes that as him being free to just take over my one day... It sucks.\n\nI say all of this to say that parents that are in their own heads and do not put themselves in a position of empathy (something you would think your wife would have as a doc), only ever consider them selves.

Jim tells Toby if Pam could just wait a little longer... And Toby asks him how long that is.  A week?  A month?  And tells him it might be easier to wait if there was an end in sight.\n\nI think ESH because I'd hate having an in-law or anyone really just in my house, especially after a really long work day.  I'd feel even more guilty and like I was failing my family, because it'd feel like I had an audience to my shortcomings.  \n\nHowever I don't think it's unreasonable for you to take a break while you can, because single parent burn out is a lot.  On top of also working. \n\nI don't really know if there is a compromise to be had.  Maybe the kids stay with your mom so your wife also has a sort of half break?  Or do two long weekends two months in a row?  I'm not sure.  I think the situation sucks but I don't think you're an AH for taking the situation into your own hands after letting your needs be known so vocally for so long.

It would be all NTAs and calls for divorce if the genders were flipped", ">  If wife ever decides her family is worth 10 minutes of her attention,\n\nI like how you think she isnt thinking about her family and shes doing all of this on purpose.", "congratulations you learned how to downvote. Must be a big day for you :)", "Then I wouldn't stop her.  If she wants a nanny instead of my mom, go ahead and hire one.  But I'm not going to be the one doing the leg work on that.", "Maybe it's not about the money but that he gets a break and she doesn't. At least not yet but OP can't wait forever either.", "You're right about not bashing OP wife. She is working hard and has no control over her job being understaffed. Going off your other comments about the wife not wanting his mom to watch kids or money issue to why she doesn't approve of his trip to get away. \nKept scrolling down and replied to this comment instead of scrolling back up.", "If it helps I have also advocated OP to divorce his wife. He got mad at me for that", "If she wanted to she would. She has been told over and over again and she refuses to do anything but come up with another excuse as to why it's a \"no\". Life isn't all about the dollar for everyone.", "I mean she is?  \nMen get shit on all the time for being the primary earner and not pulling their weight at home. OPs wife is doing the SAME thing. Prioritizing work over family life, now at the expense of her husband mental health when he has been begging her for moths for a break. Just because she is a working mom, doesn't give her a pass to shit all over her husband who just needs a fucking break. He also works full time, is the primary childcare, and home care. Give the man a fucking break. OPs wife probably wouldn't have even noticed he went on the trip if he didn't tell her.", "She is probably also suffering from burnout.", "Not to mention a doctor DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. I\u2019m guessing she has not had a fun time since about January 2020, we are in the midst of an unprecedented crisis and medical professionals are burning out at insane rates.", "I mean it seems like you want out of this marriage so why not just get divorced. Why waste your time on passive aggressive trips and just pull the trigger.", "How close does your mother live? Could the kids stay with her so both you and your wife get some kind of break?", "Goodness. Hopefully he can fix things then.", "You dont know what the wife is going through and the random bashing of her is fun to do but isnt looking at what she is also going through.", "Again the fact is everyone is treating this OPs wife as if she is some deadbeat and thats the issue i have. FYI if the genders were switched i would have the same opinion. Its a marriage if its not working and one side isnt willing to work on it get divorced not need to drag it on and be angry all the time.", "Yeah they are just having fun bashing her for working to much.", "Dude, you've spent a lot of time on this thread, maybe go somewhere else for a bit, huh?  I'm not divorcing my wife over this.", "Clearly you are not married.", "An hour away.  Too far to have the kids stay with her as the 2 oldest are in school and the youngest is in daycare.  I'm not pulling them out of school for this.", "I do know what it is like to have a demanding job but guess what I'm also a mom, wife and person so I know how to set boundaries. I've also been in OPs position and it gets old fast. The wife is making her decisions without a care in the world about her family so\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "LOL from his comments he seems done with her and if he is done he should just call it quits and get divorced. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with that sometimes its for the best.", "You really dont know that since all we have is OPs side so im not going to bash her just for fun. You do you but thats just me"]}
