This is exactly when a partner is supposed to step up, not make things more difficult. \n\nA friend of mine\u2019s partner went through something similar recently. The worst time for them was when he was getting all the tests done because there were so many unknowns. I\u2019m not saying that this is the same for everybody, but don\u2019t underestimate this period of time.

Also, assuming that you've been supporting him with that, probably doing more than your fair share around the house, for the kids.\n- The most support he will need will likely be post his surgery. You will be there for that.\n- Kids are 7 and 4. They're generally quite self-sufficient at those ages, and there won't be much need for him to be picking them up, doing everything for them.\n- There are other people involved, so the likelihood is, if you don't go, you'll miss out.\n- Marriage is a partnership. Sometimes, the roller coasters aren't in sync. \n\nI think he needs to suck it up. Be a husband and understand that with young kids, you don't get opportunities like this very often.\n\nEdit. Corrected my misconception that it was back surgery.", ">He has a surgery coming up, which is the day after I get back - not while I'm away. \n\nThis is why you're NTA!

Cutting the trip a little shorter would be a more reasonable compromise in my opinion. You can't go for 3-4 days and come give him 2-3 days of resting up and moral support before the big day?

You can go on holiday as *a family* once everything is done and he is feeling more like himself.", "YTA. Quick story time. I had a trip planned with a group of women. Very excited to go. Ended up in the hospital a week before the trip, and a week after. I thought it was a heart attack from stress, it wasn't. I have lupus and the flare up put lots of fluid on my heart and lungs. It took about 3 weeks to figure it out and keep me stable enough to go home. \n\nAnyway, majority of the group was very understanding about me not going. The travel agent even got me credits for the price of the trip and flights. However, the girlfriend I was closest to and had invited me, had a really inappropriate reaction to my situation. Suffice it to say, she and I are no longer  friends. That one convo completely ended our 10 year friendship. . . \n\nIt hurts when you are in a scary situation and people who you think love you do everything in that moment to show you they could care less. My husband made those 3 weeks work for him and the kids, still had time to get to work and do all the things I usually do AND come to see me most days to make sure I was being cared for properly.  Our families came together and helped us tremendously during and after my stay in the hospital. \n\n\nI honestly couldn't imagine having to wonder if my spouse loved me because he chose to be really selfish instead of supporting me through a trying time. And honestly, if he had worried me one time about how to handle the house while I was fighting for my life, I would seriously reconsider our relationship. I think your husband may be on his way to this train of thought. There are many factors tied into these procedures. And if he's caring for kids for a whole week before he's supposed to be having surgery, it can be delayed for another month and get worse, because his blood pressure is too high from the stress he will definitely be prone to because he's doing everything alone, the week before his procedure. And he couldn't properly rest. I understand you may \"need\" this trip. However, your family needs you right now. And that pre-op preparation is critical to the success of actually getting that procedure on time. I'm appalled that even though you are fully aware your husband has melanoma you are still like, \"I'm not sick, I'm taking the trip.\" Even after he expressed he's really worried. \n\nIt feels like you don't want to deal with your new reality. And if that is the case, perhaps you need to talk to your husband and let him know how you really feel, so he can get some people around him who really gives a damn about supporting him through this time. The fact that your friends aren't advising you to sit this trip out is disappointing as well. Do they even know?", "I knew I was right to hold off until OP confirmed what the surgery was. Dude, YTA.
