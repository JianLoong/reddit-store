Also, assuming that you've been supporting him with that, probably doing more than your fair share around the house, for the kids.\n- The most support he will need will likely be post his surgery. You will be there for that.\n- Kids are 7 and 4. They're generally quite self-sufficient at those ages, and there won't be much need for him to be picking them up, doing everything for them.\n- There are other people involved, so the likelihood is, if you don't go, you'll miss out.\n- Marriage is a partnership. Sometimes, the roller coasters aren't in sync. \n\nI think he needs to suck it up. Be a husband and understand that with young kids, you don't get opportunities like this very often.\n\nEdit. Corrected my misconception that it was back surgery.\n\nEdit 2. I was wrong. OP YTA. I guess I gave you too much benefit of the doubt. You've drip fed information through other comments starting after I posted my initial response. I tried to stick with you because I went through a fraction of what he's going through after skin cancer removal on my lip (my mouth is now half it's previous size - unfortunately I'm still loud-mouthed!). I knew how difficult and stressful it was for my wife not knowing and particularly afterwards as I couldn't talk, or eat, and was in a lot of pain. A holiday would have been helpful for her.

You can go on holiday as *a family* once everything is done and he is feeling more like himself.", "YTA. Quick story time. I had a trip planned with a group of women. Very excited to go. Ended up in the hospital a week before the trip, and a week after. I thought it was a heart attack from stress, it wasn't. I have lupus and the flare up put lots of fluid on my heart and lungs. It took about 3 weeks to figure it out and keep me stable enough to go home. \n\nAnyway, majority of the group was very understanding about me not going. The travel agent even got me credits for the price of the trip and flights. However, the girlfriend I was closest to and had invited me, had a really inappropriate reaction to my situation. Suffice it to say, she and I are no longer  friends. That one convo completely ended our 10 year friendship. . . \n\nIt hurts when you are in a scary situation and people who you think love you do everything in that moment to show you they could care less. My husband made those 3 weeks work for him and the kids, still had time to get to work and do all the things I usually do AND come to see me most days to make sure I was being cared for properly.  Our families came together and helped us tremendously during and after my stay in the hospital. \n\n\nI honestly couldn't imagine having to wonder if my spouse loved me because he chose to be really selfish instead of supporting me through a trying time. And honestly, if he had worried me one time about how to handle the house while I was fighting for my life, I would seriously reconsider our relationship. I think your husband may be on his way to this train of thought. There are many factors tied into these procedures. And if he's caring for kids for a whole week before he's supposed to be having surgery, it can be delayed for another month and get worse, because his blood pressure is too high from the stress he will definitely be prone to because he's doing everything alone, the week before his procedure. And he couldn't properly rest. I understand you may \"need\" this trip. However, your family needs you right now. And that pre-op preparation is critical to the success of actually getting that procedure on time. I'm appalled that even though you are fully aware your husband has melanoma you are still like, \"I'm not sick, I'm taking the trip.\" Even after he expressed he's really worried. \n\nIt feels like you don't want to deal with your new reality. And if that is the case, perhaps you need to talk to your husband and let him know how you really feel, so he can get some people around him who really gives a damn about supporting him through this time. The fact that your friends aren't advising you to sit this trip out is disappointing as well. Do they even know?", "I knew I was right to hold off until OP confirmed what the surgery was. Dude, YTA.

I admit 6 days twice per year is a bit on the high side, but the occasional long weekend shouldn't be an issue.\n\nUnder normal circumstances.\n\nMajor cancer surgery is not normal circumstances. If he needs your support, you need to be there for him. And I don't know what his energy level is, but there are absolutely types of cancer where taking care of kids on your own is simply not an option.\n\nPostpone the trip or skip it. Especially if you do these things twice a year, you can easily miss one.", "HOLY SEXISM BATMAN", "He HAS cancer, this is to determine the spread.", "Not even knowing what he had, I could see that he needed help. He told her that he was really tired and could use the support. She just didn't hear that at all and was still planning on going.", "[removed]", "Hopefully, he changes the beneficiary to the children and leaves out the useless wife.", "While I agree OP is the AH considering what the surgery is for. But three years, no break, sick husband, two kids\u2026I don\u2019t see \u201cshe doesn\u2019t care if he has cancer\u201d. I see \u201ctotally burnt out mum and wife who is probably walking a very fine line of sanity. This trip has probably been her life line since it was planned and the only thing she\u2019s had to look forward to. Yes, that is completely 100% selfish, but considering the childcare is falling completely on the husband while she\u2019s away makes me assume they have no family to help which means she is on her own all the time with two kids and a sick husband. She\u2019s probably completely drained and needs a break before her \u201cbreak\u201d becomes the psych ward. Not the best timing, and I definitely wouldn\u2019t go, but have some thought to what this woman is going through as well", "Its AITA, they are incapable", "Also if a friend of mine went on a trip with me and friends while their partner was in that state, I would look sideways at them.", "I've known men with colds that'll still go out to the pub with the boys, but will then come home and are magically too sick to get up and get themselves a glass of water.", "Although I see where you\u2019re coming from, OP has said this is a recent diagnosis so she hasn\u2019t been taking care of all of them for three years. When she mentions the three years she\u2019s talking about covid. Secondly she has also admitted that she takes trips like this probably 1 or 2 times a year. Which, I don\u2019t know about you, before covid even hit, i hadn\u2019t had a vacation in years. Just from my point of view there\u2019s no way I could understand her leaving him at home with the kids right before a major surgery for a possibly deadly form of cancer. If you\u2019ve waited 3 years for a vacation because of covid, why can\u2019t you wait a little longer for your husbands cancer treatments? And this is coming from someone who has actually been burnt out to the point of being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.", "She hasn't been caring for him though....\n\nWhat care burnout?", "1000%.", "Is AITA, husbands are second class citizens here", "Idk and you dont either so no use speculating and dog piling unconfirmed claims against OP. Call her an a hole for going on a trip before a surgery but don't keep making things up and claim she'll be cheating or getting divorced. We only see one side of stuff, so unless op tells us she is going to cheat (or, btw it could be an open marriage but gee, its not super relevant or confirmed) then go take your vitriol against this stranger somewhere else", "You\u2019re really really protecting this person who has outwardly shown to be TA and selfish. If your loved one said that to you, left you in your time of need \u201cto fulfill their own needs\u201d. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s reaching. Maybe wouldn\u2019t have made it the purpose of the trip but I DOUBT OP would turn away the opportunity if it happened. Meet some people. There\u2019s a LOT of darkness out there.\n\nY\u2019all act like open relationships are the norm. They absolutely could be but I think it\u2019s only like 4-5% of couples who even attempt that (just googled a stat). To me it seems like you\u2019re really reaching to protect someone who doesn\u2019t need to be protected. Did this situation hit a little too close to home for you?"]}
