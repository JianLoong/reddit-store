So while he\u2019s at home processing what may be happening - which could be anything from something treatable to terminal - and having to manage the kids on his own, you\u2019re living it up partying. This is exactly when a partner is supposed to step up, not make things more difficult. \n\nA friend of mine\u2019s partner went through something similar recently. The worst time for them was when he was getting all the tests done because there were so many unknowns. I\u2019m not saying that this is the same for everybody, but don\u2019t underestimate this period of time. Your husband will be dealing with a great deal of emotional load and he needs help with that and help with having the time to process things. \n\nI\u2019m disgusted, honestly.

You are leaving out details as to how ill he is before the surgery. \n\nIf it were an elective surgery where he felt fine prior, then of course go.

Also, assuming that you've been supporting him with that, probably doing more than your fair share around the house, for the kids.\n- The most support he will need will likely be post his surgery. You will be there for that.\n- Kids are 7 and 4. They're generally quite self-sufficient at those ages, and there won't be much need for him to be picking them up, doing everything for them.\n- There are other people involved, so the likelihood is, if you don't go, you'll miss out.\n- Marriage is a partnership. Sometimes, the roller coasters aren't in sync. \n\nI think he needs to suck it up. Be a husband and understand that with young kids, you don't get opportunities like this very often.\n\nEdit. Corrected my misconception that it was back surgery.", ">He has a surgery coming up, which is the day after I get back - not while I'm away. \n\nThis is why you're NTA!

As long as you would offer the same to your husband, go.  \n\nSelfish is NOT taking the trip. As you need to be a good parent. And being a good parent means having some balance. I would LOVE it if my spouse went on a trip. Id get to do some extra fun things with the kids and they would come home with some new experiences.   \n\nPlus, the kids are old enough now. A 7 and 5 year old for a week is a fun age group to have!  \n\nThe only caveat is if his surgery means physically he is messed up right now.
