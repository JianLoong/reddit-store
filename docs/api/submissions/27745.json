You have no obligation of paying for everyone's dinner but if this is going to be your attitude just say \"I'm buying a pizza and I'm willing to share it with you\", calling it \"your treat\" implies you're actually treating them... not letting them have whatever you won't have. You suck for that mentality and that attitude. \n\nYour roommate sucks too, though.
