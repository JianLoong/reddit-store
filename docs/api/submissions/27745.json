I was the first one to grab my slices, 2 of them, and grabbed the biggest slices since it looked like they sliced it a bit weird. Now, I (25F), can eat the 2 slices just fine and with the cheese bread we got with it, it's a nice sized meal for me. \n\nMy roommates B (26F) and H (28M) came to the kitchen shortly after to grab their peices and to thank me for buying dinner. H saw the 2 slices I had before he opened the box and said \"Wow, did you get the XL pizza?\" and when he opened the box he got a disappointed look and his shoulders drooped. When I asked what's wrong, he started saying in a depressed tone \"these peices are all smaller, I'm the biggest person here so I should have gotten the biggest peices honestly...\"\n\nI said \"No, I bought the pizza so I get to pick my slices first, and I wanted these ones.\" To which he replied that I was throwing the fact that I bought it in everyone's faces and that was a shitty thing to do. He then said \"since you got more pizza I should get more cheese bread to make it even\".

This man is nearly 30 complaining about who got more like a kid squabbling with their sibling..", "INFO\n\nDO you and your roommates take turns buying pizza or did you just do this to be nice?", "NTA. This is why the phrase \"don't look a gift horse in the mouth\" exists. We could change it to \"don't complain about your gifted pizza to the person who gifted it to you.\"  I don't get the  A H comments here. You offered to buy pizza. Cool. If roommates don't like it, they can eat something else.  \n\n\n*\"I'm the biggest person here so I should have gotten the biggest pieces honestly...\"* is just ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nYou paid for pizza, and you took first 2 slices. I assume that there were 6 slices left, and even if they were smaller, they everyone would still have enough.", "NTA\n\nYou should offered to give him double his money back if he wasn\u2019t satisfied!", "Did he bite your hand as you were feeding him, too? If he doesn't like it, he can buy his own pizza. NTA", "NTA you didn\u2019t throw anything in their face lmao, he asked a question and just got an answer he didn\u2019t like.", "NTA\u2014- he can eat zero slices if it bothers him that mich", "NTA. \"Sorry, I paid for the pizza, you are free to order your own pizza, you ungrateful A..\" Also, he is being sexist, he is male so he deserves the larger piece. Haha.", "NTA - The audacity to complain like you\u2019re their parent! I would be thanking you and offering to make you a drink so you could sit and enjoy your slices!", "NTA and you now have a story for r/ChoosingBeggars", "Nta.\n\nNext time don't offer them any.\n\nPeople complaining about free food pisses me off!", "How about a thank you for buying pizza-it was very good? \n\nNext time, buy a small pizza for yourself. NTA", "NTA- I would be wary this dude is always going to be entitled. Good for you for stating firm pizza boundaries. What a brat complaining about how much free food he was getting.", "NTA your roommate had a massive entitlement issue. If he wants the big slices he can buy his own pizza. Who cares how big of a guy he is.", "NTA he sounds like an entitled AH.\n\nIf he doesn't like it, he can buy his own food. How ungrateful!", "NTA I feel that if you were hungry and wanted those slices that's fine. It did not seem to me that you were throwing anything in anyone's face.", "When someone buys me food, I politely accept what is given to me as a gesture of gratitude and civility.  To squabble like a child about who has more and who got the first piece is so embarrassing and petulant.  Not even a thank you but complaints.  How about he buys himself his own damned food and you all avoid this argument in the future?  You being the buyer of said food, *should get first dibs as a matter of principle.*  NTA", "NTA", "NTA- you treated, they don't have to get any if they don't want.", "If you just invited them on a whim, NTA, beggars can't be choosers.\nIf you do this on a rotation and was your turn, you would kind if be TA in my book.\n\nEdit: I saw your reply above, nope, NTA, they are just a lil' bit entitled, you're the only one who invited them for anything!", "Ok, I'm going to go with NTA, but to understand just how much of an AH H is depends on how many slices there were in the pizza.\n\nI mean, if there was 6 slices total and the two large slices ammounted to like half the pizza then I'd think they'd have a point. You'd not really be buying pizza for everyone.\n\nBut if those two slices were less than a third of the pizza then I don't know what the heck he was going on about? Who cares about the size of the slices? Just grab 3 or 4 if they are small.\n\nalso demanding more of some other part of the meal just launches him into pure AH", "Yta. You paid, sure, but you offered. If there are two gigantic slices, fairness would dictate not taking both of them. If someone gets a significantly smaller portion, fairness dictates they get more of the cheese bread.\n\nHis attitude that he should always get more because he's bigger is kinda  bullshit, but has at least some basis in reality, but offering to spot dinner comes with the responsibility that everybody be fed to reasonably the same degree.", "YTA. Sure, you paid for the pizza, but offering to treat your roommates to dinner comes with some unspoken etiquette. Hogging the largest slices just because you're footing the bill makes the gesture feel less genuine and more like a power move. You tainted the whole meal with a me-first attitude. Sharing means considering others, not just throwing your money around to justify taking more than your fair share.", "ESH. You bought them leftovers, not pizza. That\u2019s hardly buying them dinner. Complaining about free food sucks too. I suggest you all buy your own dinner in the future.", "Both are TA\n\nIf you chose to purchase a pizza for everyone, you\u2019re choosing to share it. Yes it was cut weirdly, but you could\u2019ve chosen one bigger piece and one smaller piece. \n\nOn the other hand the guy could\u2019ve been more grateful he had food brought for him and said thankyou. It isn\u2019t really a big deal.", "YTA softly \n\nYou decided to buy it for everyone. If that was me I would\u2019ve just taken two random slices. Perhaps a bigger one and a smaller one. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t have purchased pizza for everyone if you didn\u2019t want to share it equally\u2026\n\nBut on the other hand the way he went about it was quite rude. He seemed a bit ungrateful and whiny about it. It didn\u2019t have to be made into a big thing. I would\u2019ve just took the pizza slices and said Thankyou, I don\u2019t even think I would\u2019ve looked enough to notice.", "ESH.\n\nH is an ah for complaining about free food.\n\nYou suck for throwing a total power move to try to show off.\n\nB suck just a bit for just staying in the sidelines, but at the same time, she doesn't suck due to just accepting the gift, and not complaining about it, while wanting to just stay out of the argument (I would've done the exact same thing)", "ESH. You all seem to be ignoring the fact that the size of the slices doesn't change the size of the pizza... having two bigger slices or three smaller ones makes no difference as to the amount of pizza you'll eat. \n\nThat said, saying a meal is \"your treat\" but then purposely grabbing more of it before anyone else (you really didn't, again, as slices size make no difference, but alas) and upon questioned saying \"I paid for it therefore I'm entitled to more or better parts of this meal\" is rather rude. You have no obligation of paying for everyone's dinner but if this is going to be your attitude just say \"I'm buying a pizza and I'm willing to share it with you\", calling it \"your treat\" implies you're actually treating them... not letting them have whatever you won't have. You suck for that mentality and that attitude. \n\nYour roommate sucks too, though. Because \"I'm bigger so I should get more food\" when it's a meal meant to be shared is also a shitty attitude to have. \n\nOverall you all need to grow up before you share your meals. And also learn how pizza size vs slice size works.", "YTA. \n\nDon\u2019t buy food to share and then hog it to yourself whilst simultaneously rubbing it in their faces.", "YTA\n\nthey were guests to your meal.", "ESH.  You all need to buy your own pizzas at this rate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
