You have no obligation of paying for everyone's dinner but if this is going to be your attitude just say \"I'm buying a pizza and I'm willing to share it with you\", calling it \"your treat\" implies you're actually treating them... not letting them have whatever you won't have. You suck for that mentality and that attitude. \n\nYour roommate sucks too, though.

It was incredibly rude of him to even mention that you took the bigger slices, considering that you bought the pizza.", "I feel like it's polite to grab the biggest slice and the third biggest slice, but there's three important things.\n\nMost importantly, your friend being butthurt over free food is the asshole move here. When I was in his position (I was always the largest among my friends) and someone bought me food, I was nothing but grateful. \n\nI would also eat something small before going somewhere in case there wasn't enough food to go around, but that's just some internalised trauma from when I was a kid and an aunt said I was selfish for getting seconds at a family dinner. Still, if you're the type to get hungry it's a smart thing to do\n\nSecond point, sounds like there wasn't enough food to go around. When you're hosting it's best to have leftovers afterwards in my opinion. I always do when I host. That being said, other people should definitely chip in for food costs, or do a potluck and have everyone bring something.\n\nFinally, and kind of a lame point to end on, but that pizza place shouldn't have cut the pizza so poorly. I worked at a pizza shop for like 6 years, it isn't hard to cut them fast and correctly\n\nEdit: somehow I missed the part about you being roommates, and thought they were house guests.

If you are hungry ...take a big slice (or two - which you did) or take 3 big slices and eat it.

But it's good to have a conflicting argument sometimes ....instead of keeping quiet so Cheers to you both for that!

If anything, he was a SIZE-IST.", "What's extra weird about that is that as the parent of adults, *I PAY FOR DINNER*. That's just how I've always done it and seen it done, with few exceptions. Especially if I want something nice and I know my kids can't afford it. My kids will invite me over for dinner and cook a nice meal, but if it's a restaurant I assume I'm buying, and encourage them to get a little something for leftovers since, well, they're starting out and I'm 52.

My BF brought his kids over for movie night last week and paid for dinner for all 7 of us, and all my kids were asked to do was pick it up on their way over. \n\nIt's so weird for MIL's BF to buy a gas station sausage roll, announce that he doesn't like McDonald's, offer nothing to anyone else, and then act pissy because he didn't get the McDonald's he rejected.", "I mean I have to agree, if you tell people you\u2019re buying dinner, it should be enough to feed them. \n\nBut I\u2019m mostly confused about what kind of pizza only has 6 slices", "Agreed, the only honourable thing to do is to make sure everyone has an equal share regardless of their physical size - so cut some of the large slice into smaller pieces. Don't be an ass OP with your gifting.", "Eight slices plus cheesy bread. Three people. OP bought ALL OF IT and took 2 large slices instead of 3 smaller slices.

In an 8 slice pizza, that means the two large slices make up about 40% of the pizza. In a 6 slice pizza, the two large slices make up 50% of the pizza. In a 12 slice pizza, two large slices would only be 28% of the pizza.\n\nFully agree with everything else you said though.", "If I fly or if I buy, I get the bigger fry.

Haha. \n\nMaybe you don\u2019t eat much pizza, but they swipe the cutter right across, so probably one cut that went across the entire pizza was uneven.

I could say the society is sexist since I have to pay alot more for food then women since there are not alot women in my size and if they are I still need way more energy since my size comes from muscle. Bigger people dont deserve more food but they *need* it. That's a big difference. If you would eat like me you would be heavily oversized. I dont complain since you nor I can change anything about it. But to think bigger people dont need more food is so wrong.\n\nGuy in the post is an asshole anyway. Free food is free food.

But those guys are really fucking it up for anyone who do know how to behave.\n\nThe problem is that most women encounter those guys way to often, or those guys approach women way to often.
