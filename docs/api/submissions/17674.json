But I also agree with your point that the kids are stable so it's not fair to uproot their lives like this. However, they are still young enough (under 8 if my math is correct) to make this change without it impacting their lives significantly. The older kids get, the more difficult it becomes.\n\nSo why YTA? Because you are both parents to these children and should make joint decisions.

Not only are you an asshole for not letting your husband have a say in their education, but you are an asshole for all your comments on here. Why post on Reddit for opinions, then argue with everyone when they don't agree with you? Were you hoping for validation, hoping we would all jump on the bandwagon and say your husband shouldn't have a say in the matter? Cos thats what it sounds like, big time. Nearly every commenter on here said that you should take your husband opinion into account, not just dismiss him outright. Which is what you are doing, whether you want to admit it or not. And thats totally shitty of you to do. He is their parent too, his opinion matters. He thinks its too expensive and you live in a better neighborhood with better schools, so its worth looking into. Tour the schools, talk to neighbors that have kids in the schools, look up their graduation stats. See if it might be a good idea to put them in a public school. They are not all bad. Some of them are better than private schools. At least consider it before dismissing him outright. You are a PARTNERSHIP, not a dictatorship.

Because as a teacher, there are a lot of things that go into making a school good. Test scores are just one small thing. Teachers in private education do not need a teaching certificate.

Most people don\u2019t realize the opportunities private schools allows most kids and quite frankly the education is 10 times better. I\u2019m extremely grateful to my parents for their sacrifice for putting me in a private school as I went from a b/c student with teachers who didn\u2019t give a shit to an A/A* student, I got accepted into several top universities later onwards as well. \nTeachers in private schools care! They are more involved with students; I went to 6 different public schools and none of my teachers were ever as involved as my teachers in private schools. They would give us as many resources possible, sit down with us if we didn\u2019t understand something and they would push us for the best results. \nFurthermore the attitude in public schools is wildly different in private schools, it\u2019s a very relaxed environment and I did often witness many kids be disrespectful to one another and to those in charge, but that shit doesn\u2019t fly in private schools. No one messed about, it was fun but there was also a huge emphasis on education and not just the typical maths and English, they also allowed students in subjects like art and history to prosper as well.\n\nI don\u2019t know your children\u2019s ages but a compromise could be public school till say 13 and then private school for the most important years. This is what my parents did and it really worked out for me.", "YTA. They aren\u2019t your kids they are both your kids equally. You have an equal right to make decisions.

I actually agree if they are established in this private school it would be a good idea to continue that path. But your husband has just as much say on that issue as you are both the parents.

And you did say you and your husband agreed on this matter beforehand.\n\nBut I still think you need to at least check out this new school. Maybe it's actually a good establishment, and you'd be able to save money and start a fund for your kid's future college tuition.\n\nAt the very least, you should sit down and listen to what your husband has to say with an open mind. Maybe try to meet him halfway and find a compromise. You both are equally allowed to make decisions about your children. Not just you, OP.", "YTA for the reasons other commenters have outlined here. Marriage and parenting is a partnership, not a dictatorship. But I also want to add that private school ain't all its cracked up to be. You moved to an area with a very highly rated public school. That school could easily be just as good or even better than the one you're sending them to now. Save money on their education now and spend it later. If you're in the US, save it to send them to college so they can graduate debt free. Trust me they'll end up appreciating that a lot more than having you spend all of it on primary school, and a good college matters a whole heck of a lot more than a good elementary/high school.", "It's both of our finances, so in what way is that not both of us making a financial sacrifice.

If you are making the unilateral decision without giving a shit about his opinion then you should solely cover the tuition and any of your bills. You are very quick to jump down everyone's throat when no one here has directly said you don't have a job.  Chill out.", "Why do OPs get so defensive. You don't mention anything about working or who pays in your post. All  you said was HE was concerned about financials so if people assume it's he who is paying you can't get upset", "I didn't say you didn't contribute financially to the household as well. I said you're treating your husband like a cash cow you milk. As in trying to disregard his input.", "That isn't what u/Heloise_Morris said. You are acting like YOU are the only one who gets decide the education of your children. Thus resulting in you treating YOUR husband's financial contribution as a CASH COW instead of the joint asset it is. The point is, if YOU are not personally earning enough of your OWN money to pay for their education without using the JOINT money, than YOU don't get SOLE decision of where they go to school. I get it, OP, you thought you'd come here and people would side with you. That didn't work out so now you are being deliberately obtuse in an attempt to justify your invalidation of your husband. Whew, it must be exhausting being so dramatic all the time.", "The statement is straight forward enough, you don't want a partner, you want a pet that can talk and without having an opinion.", "YTA for more reasons now. The very idea you can't fathom why people would look at your relationship and say your husband is a pet is a massive red flag for anyone with adult level thinking.\n\nIn essence your husband is a pet because he lives in your house but has no say on policy, especially in regards to his pups or kids in this circumstance, but we're going to call them pups because of the situation you created.\n\nSticking to an agreed upon plan made three years ago without taking into consideration the current situation is narrow minded and a foolish decision. \n\nThe very fact your husband has little to no say in this matter is something you should very much be ashamed of. Parents raise puppies best when they work together, not when the dictator wife makes all the decisions. \n\nI would add on a personal level, I was sent to what was considered the best private school in my area and I found myself less prepared for life than my friends who went to a public school. All my private school did was prep me for college and all college did was take my money and hand me a piece of paper I don't even use. For the record I'm a reactor operator in R&D and it was my work history and skills that got my the job, not my \"prestigious\" high school. Skills I might add, I had to learn on my own.\n\nBe better and remind yourself parenting is a two person job to do right and currently you are in the way of the two person job. Stop trying to die un unnecessary hills and actually work with your husband instead of against him.", "Based on what you wrote, you and your husband made the decision together on the private school. Now your circumstances have changed and you are in a better area with a better public education rating, maybe even a way better one, and you are dismissive of your husband's input. Education of children is one of those parenting decisions that requires two yesses. Particularly if you are talking about expensive private school tuition. YTA, because you vetoed your husband. Have not listened to why he wants the change. Have treated him as if he doesn't get a say in how HIS children are raised. And that, OP, is why you were accused of treating your husband like your pet and not your partner.", "Are you going to go into debt? What about the prospect of college for your kids?

The only reason people in my district sent their kids to private schools was pretty much for religious regions and in general I felt like public school opens yourself up to more diversity in thought, class and race. Obviously that's not always the case and where I live now public schools are pretty shit.\n\nIf you have personal experience in the school and feel like it's not a good fit then NTA might be more appropriate.", "If you read the whole thing, you'd see how he has just recently started to involve himself with their education.

Otherwise you seem awfully defensive and quick to name call...\n\n I work my tail off to send my kids to private school. Mostly because when my child was little, I researched all local schools. I took tours if possible.  I talked to local parents. Our local public school principal talked the entire tour about the football team. When I mentioned that we were not interested in football, he continued to talk only to my husband. We spoke to teachers on that tour. Both commented that my son would be great in a few years for the football team, one made the comment that it was a good thing we had a boy because he would be more useful than our daughters. The same teacher told a neighbor's daughter that she didnt need college because she was too pretty. \n\nWith a lot of ppl, it's not a status thing. I want my kids to play sports if they want to. But I firmly believe school should be about education and preparing them for the world. A lot of public schools seem to be obsessed with sports. I don't know why. I'm not rich, I had to work 2 jobs to afford it. I don't have the time or resources to have a lawyer to fight the school board, either. All of us just want what's best for our children. Most teachers are great and truly want to teach. But public school funding is a joke, and teacher burnout is real.", "I do have personal experience, I've been to all the public schools in our area growing up due to moving so much, and none of them cared about education unless you're a football player", "So if he is now involved, he absolutely has a legitimate opinion.

Listen to him and be willing to change your mind if circumstances demand it. Make your case to him without belittling him. TOGETHER, come to a decision about your children's future.", "That is a lie. You wrote that you BOTH made the decision to put the kids in the private school. You also wrote that your oldest has been there for 3 years.

You don't individually have the resources to put your kids in private school, therefore you don't *individually* get to make the decision to use *joint* funds. \n\nIt's comical how determined you are not to see the ridiculous hypocrisy in your \"our money that *I* alone decide how to spend\" attitude. \n\nYou've still completely avoided making any sort of case as to **why** You should get to override your husband's opinion on how to spend \"family money\" or have a say in your children's education. \n\nThere is a very good case to be made for quality of life vs sacrificing for the future.

My parents tried to make private school work for us and ended up having to take us out when I was a teenager which made the transition so much harder than if I had been younger. \n\nWe were also *much* happier in the public school. There were more options for extra curriculars, more than two personality types to encounter, more open minded and passionate teachers, more connections to the community.\n\nI would never have survived in college if I hadn't gotten the social skills I did in public high school. Private school was so insulated and social dynamics based on cults of personality rather than shared interests and values. I know more than one private school kid who had a breakdown because they couldn't handle being in an environment with 15,000 students after knowing everyone in the building's name their while life.\n\nThat isn't to say there weren't drawbacks too, but I personally was so much happier with my parents not being under so much financial pressure and were were actually able to go on a vacation which we never had the money to spare for when they were paying private school tuition.", "Again.
