Sorry for your loss.  Don't let your MIL take that pin home with her after the service.  If she does that, you will *never* see it again.  She wants it on the memento table because it will be easier for her to remove it and take it home with her.  If the pin is on your late wife MIL will have a harder time getting her hands on it.

I don\u2019t there is anything worst for a mother than losing a child. \nThe answer to your question is not easy for me because I honestly think that funerals and the \u2018after\u2019 are for the ones that survived, not the deceased. Would this pin be a comfort to MIL? Is there any other reason?\nIt\u2019s good that you want to respect you wife\u2019s wishes but it\u2019s not something along the lines of \u201cshe wanted to be cremated and they want a burial\u201d. It\u2019s a pin. What would your wife have done if she had had this discussion with her mother? If she had known her mother would survive her?\n\nFrom where I stand, fussing over a pin with someone who lost their child is not necessary. Can you not find a middle ground such as giving her 1 year before sending it back? It could be something to organize in her memory.\nI am not a religious person so it obviously influences my answer.", "NTA and my condolences on your loss. Your late wife left instructions she wanted followed. She trusted you to do this for her and you are honouring her wishes. They should be followed 100%.

It's the right thing to observe her last wishes.", "Of course you should follow your wife's wishes.  Your separation has nothing to do with it.  \n\nI'm glad to hear you've been doing better with your mental health issues and hope very much that you'll be able to stay on that path even in the face of your wife's tragic death.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Sorry for your loss. Your MIL may be deep in grief, and wanting to cling onto what she can of her daughter. It\u2019s understandable. But your wife made it very clear what her wishes were, so that\u2019s what you got to do. Hold onto for a bit longer if you think it will help, but it\u2019s got to go back.", "NTA. You know what your wife wanted, and honoring that wish is the right thing to do.", "NTA, grieving mother does not get to over ride dead daughters wishes or the person left to enforce them. Anyone who things anyways is TA", "NTA.\n\nThis is a tough one.  Let's get out of the way that losing a child is the emotionally worst thing that can ever happen to someone, and a club no one ever wants to join.  Yes - with all due respect worse than losing a spouse.  However, if that child was married, it means they made the deliberate decision that they don't want their parents to be their Next-of-Kin anymore.  You were her legal Husband and Next-of-Kin since the paperwork didn't go through.\n\nUnder the circumstances that just a formality kept you that Next-of-Kin and you were almost divorced I would normally say give her back to her previous Next-of-Kin, but you knew - didn't guess, but knew - that she specifically wanted the tradition of the pin followed.  I think you did the right thing.\n\nGive her Mom some grace, though.  No one should ever bury their baby, no matter what age.", "NAH\n\nSo sorry for your loss. Tell MIL you still love your wife, and that is why honouring her wish is so important to you. Cry together.", "But she\u2019s not an asshole for trying to override a grieving husband and her dead daughters last wish?

It's sticky but you want to follow your wife's wishes. At times we give slack to grieving kinfolk.", "YTA\n\nShe's dead and won't know the difference.", "NTA. She made her wishes clear. Her mother wasn\u2019t even supposed to be alive when her daughter passed. \n\nI\u2019m sure that is what\u2019s eating her up. We\u2019re not supposed to outlive our children. \n\nExplain to her you will not budge on the things she has specified but you will bow to her wishes elsewhere. \n\nThe pain she must be feeling is immense. I\u2019m sorry for all of you.", "NTA. You are merely trying to honour your wife's last wish. It shows your love and commitment towards her.

No zombies here.\n\nHate to break it to you, but people in committed relationships will often discuss what they want to do should they die.  I have had that conversation with my partner.

Everyone should have a plan, or at least someone who knows what they want to be done if they pass at any time.  My husband knows what I want, as well as my best friend.  I made those things clear a long time ago.  The best thing for the loved ones, is to know what to do in the those events.  It makes things a little less stressful in an emotionally destructive time.

It\u2019s hard to explain, but to us, the pins represent our membership within a greater organization and we cherish that legacy and protect it. Therefore, OP\u2019s wife made her wishes clear that she wanted to follow the rules of the organization for what happens to the pin upon her death. One option is sending it back, since it cannot be buried with her (OP responded she will be cremated).
