MIL want to display it in the box on a table with other mementos", "Yes, the rules are you can be buried with it (pinned over the heart) or send it back and you move up to the final degree for sisters who passed away.

I\u2019ll be dead so I won\u2019t care.", "It seems like MIL is trying desperately to maintain a sense of control in a situation for which she has none (the death of your wife/her daughter). Your wife was proud of her sorority, it was such a big part if her life that she wants to include it in her death. This was important to her. I respect you for respecting your wife\u2019s wishes. Maybe MIL needs to be reminded of this.", "NTA. Alum Sorority member here. You are correct on the pin being on the left side over her heart as it's the tradition. The pin should NOT be in a box unless your wife gave instructions. DO NOT let your MIL have the pin!

Sorry for your loss.  Don't let your MIL take that pin home with her after the service.  If she does that, you will *never* see it again.  She wants it on the memento table because it will be easier for her to remove it and take it home with her.  If the pin is on your late wife MIL will have a harder time getting her hands on it.  Tell the funeral home that MIL is to *not* be given *any* of your wife's jewelry, including the pin when the time comes for them to prep her for cremation.  Instruct them to contact you even if MIL says you okayed it.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nOdd question/thought: Does the sorority have like memorial pins? That way, your MIL can still have a pin in honor of her daughter, and your wife's last wishes can be honored.", "NAH. I don\u2019t there is anything worst for a mother than losing a child. \nThe answer to your question is not easy for me because I honestly think that funerals and the \u2018after\u2019 are for the ones that survived, not the deceased. Would this pin be a comfort to MIL? Is there any other reason?\nIt\u2019s good that you want to respect you wife\u2019s wishes but it\u2019s not something along the lines of \u201cshe wanted to be cremated and they want a burial\u201d. It\u2019s a pin. What would your wife have done if she had had this discussion with her mother? If she had known her mother would survive her?\n\nFrom where I stand, fussing over a pin with someone who lost their child is not necessary. Can you not find a middle ground such as giving her 1 year before sending it back? It could be something to organize in her memory.\nI am not a religious person so it obviously influences my answer.", "NTA and my condolences on your loss. Your late wife left instructions she wanted followed. She trusted you to do this for her and you are honouring her wishes. They should be followed 100%. Don\u2019t compromise.", "NTA - This was important to someone you deeply cared about and its important to you. It sounds like it could help with closure. It was never her mother's to begin with. It's the right thing to observe her last wishes.", "Of course you should follow your wife's wishes.  Your separation has nothing to do with it.  \n\nI'm glad to hear you've been doing better with your mental health issues and hope very much that you'll be able to stay on that path even in the face of your wife's tragic death.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Sorry for your loss. Your MIL may be deep in grief, and wanting to cling onto what she can of her daughter. It\u2019s understandable. But your wife made it very clear what her wishes were, so that\u2019s what you got to do. Hold onto for a bit longer if you think it will help, but it\u2019s got to go back.", "NTA. You know what your wife wanted, and honoring that wish is the right thing to do.", "NTA, grieving mother does not get to over ride dead daughters wishes or the person left to enforce them. Anyone who things anyways is TA", "NTA.\n\nThis is a tough one.  Let's get out of the way that losing a child is the emotionally worst thing that can ever happen to someone, and a club no one ever wants to join.  Yes - with all due respect worse than losing a spouse.  However, if that child was married, it means they made the deliberate decision that they don't want their parents to be their Next-of-Kin anymore.  You were her legal Husband and Next-of-Kin since the paperwork didn't go through.\n\nUnder the circumstances that just a formality kept you that Next-of-Kin and you were almost divorced I would normally say give her back to her previous Next-of-Kin, but you knew - didn't guess, but knew - that she specifically wanted the tradition of the pin followed.  I think you did the right thing.\n\nGive her Mom some grace, though.  No one should ever bury their baby, no matter what age.", "NAH\n\nSo sorry for your loss. Tell MIL you still love your wife, and that is why honouring her wish is so important to you. Cry together.", "But she\u2019s not an asshole for trying to override a grieving husband and her dead daughters last wish? Do what your wife wanted.", "She\u2019s the one trying to override a grieving widower, not the other way around \u2026 NTA", "YTA, your wife is dead. She doesn't care. Guess who is alive and still has feelings? Her mother. This is simple enough to allow.", "NTA.  You make that happen.  The mom can fuck off", "I'm so sorry about your loss. It's sticky but you want to follow your wife's wishes. At times we give slack to grieving kinfolk.", "YTA\n\nShe's dead and won't know the difference.", "NTA. She made her wishes clear. Her mother wasn\u2019t even supposed to be alive when her daughter passed. \n\nI\u2019m sure that is what\u2019s eating her up. We\u2019re not supposed to outlive our children. \n\nExplain to her you will not budge on the things she has specified but you will bow to her wishes elsewhere. \n\nThe pain she must be feeling is immense. I\u2019m sorry for all of you.", "NTA. You are merely trying to honour your wife's last wish. It shows your love and commitment towards her.

What do they say?", "Nta for honoring your wife's wishes.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nMy mother and father had been separated since 1991. Unfortunately, when he passed last year, she still had a say in how he was to be treated. (Completely against his wishes!) The mother has no legal say in what happens with your wife.

Sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nI don't know how rare or valuable these pins are, but if you could find a reproduction or something to give your Mother in Law, she might appreciate the gesture. Maybe contact the sorority directly and ask if they have something akin to that?

Mementos are how the living stay connected to the departed.\n\nI would give the pin to her with the understanding that one day, maybe In a year, she'll be ready to send it back to the sorority.

I'm assuming that there isn't a firm deadline to send the pin back. Wait a bit and then send it back.", "I\u2019m 23 with no known health issues. My mother and closest friends know what I want to have happen to my body and a few key belongings if I were to unexpectedly pass away, including the priority list for who I would want to take care of my cat.

Having it written down means people know what to do and they don\u2019t have to make hard decisions while they\u2019re grieving. It just makes the whole process easier for them and hopefully prevents conflict like what OP is dealing with.", "Very true, but doing a rough outline is very helpful for those you leave behind - even if it\u2019s something like \u201cI\u2019d prefer to be cremated and my ashes can be disposed of by the crematorium\u201d, or \u201cI\u2019d like my body left to medical science\u201d.

This is such a sad situation but I was scared that their wasn't going to be any reddit users who understood this situation! Alumnae Sorority Member Here as well... (not sure if we're all in the same one \ud83d\ude09) but my Sorority is very clear about what to do with your Sorority property when you pass. As well as any paraphernalia should be put in a Will to pass on to other family sorors, or just Sorority sisters that you are close to. And it sounds like that it what you have here. It should be honored. I'm sorry for your loss. And if she was in fact part of a D9 Sorority, I'm sorry for our loss as well.", "You saying that like I died, cuz I'm still here dude.  No zombies here.\n\nHate to break it to you, but people in committed relationships will often discuss what they want to do should they die.  I have had that conversation with my partner. They know what I want to happen.  But they also know that I give them absolute forgiveness in doing whatever they need to keep things going.  \n\nLike yeah I'd like this kiddo to have this ring but if you need to sell it to make rent, do it."]}
