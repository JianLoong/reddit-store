You're not yelling at enough people here, OP.\n\n\"Good fathers\" don't threaten to hold back their 20yo child from college because of a small tattoo, or humiliate and browbeat them in front of extended family (or ever!), or force them to closet themselves for their sexual identity. That's not a \"good father\" you have there OP, that's a household bully.\n\nYes, your mother tattled to your father, did so at a moment calculated for maximum damage, called you a liar for having a trivial secret, participated in the ridiculous idea that parents own their child's skin so your father \"ought to know\", and is pretending to be hurt because you've realized she's utterly untrustworthy. She's on Team Dad forever, and that's her clear choice.\n\nWalk your talk, OP: *never confide anything personal to your mother again*, so long as she lives under his roof. And you do everything in your power to get out from under that roof, okay?\n\nMeanwhile, if it's not safe for you to stand up to your father's bullying, then just avoid him as best you can, close your door politely like any other adult, and direct your energy towards your plan to finish your education, get out, and leave them both far, far behind.\n\nNTA for wising up, OP -- your mother is indeed NOT on your side", "NTA, from what you've said you confided in her with the precise instructions not to tell him, she did the exact opposite an Worse she did so in front of others knowing your father has a tendency to get upset over even the smallest of things, honestly I wish I could say don't cut off confiding in her, but I wouldn't advise confiding in her anything you would worry about her speaking about,but give her chances to prove she wants you to talk with her an confide the important things to her.", "Info: Did your mom agree to keep a secret for you *before* you told her about the tattoo? Or did you tell her about the tattoo first and then say that she should keep it secret from her spouse?", "NTA and don\u2019t let her guilt you\u2026you need to reinforce that you shared a confidence with her and that she has broken your trust and that you will not be confiding in her again. Don\u2019t yell, don\u2019t shout\u2026.tell her calmly how she has caused this, not you.", "NTA but you now know you can\u2019t trust her to keep anything from your dad, so proceed with your life with that knowledge", " NTA, get a million tattoos! But learn this lesson\u2026it is not a secret you control anymore after you\u2019ve told one person.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s your body and you are 20 years old, your parents don\u2019t control you. But I\u2019m sorry to tell you this, honey, but you are in for nothing but misery and depression if you live your life to please your father. It\u2019s your life, not his. I know you are terrified that if you come out you\u2019ll never see your family again if they don\u2019t accept you, but I promise in the long run you\u2019ll be happier, as you won\u2019t be living a lie every single day.\n\nAlso, financial care does not equate to being a good parent. My father financially was very good to me, but the day I turned 18 he wiped his hands of me and we haven\u2019t spoken since.", "NTA\n\nYou cannot trust her. It is time for some kind of \"grey-rock\". Keep your parents (both!) away from anything important in your life. From now on YOU know your mother cannot be trusted, but that doesn't mean you have to TELL her. You can pretend everything is back to normal, just slowly back off to a degree where you feel comfortable.\n\nAs you are financially dependent to your parents for now, I suggest \"apologising\" to your father. He can't take the tattoo away again, so you can pretend to \"feel sorry\". Just remain the \"sweet, obeying daughter\" through your college years, grey-rocking every important information in your life. Then, once you are financially independent, you can go LC or NC.", "NTA, but move out and live your best life. She doesn\u2019t not get to decide whether you go to college or not; you\u2019re an adult. \n\nYou learnt a hard lesson: your mother is an enabler who may not be as abusive as your father, but she will take his side knowing full well what his reaction will be. She agrees with him, she\u2019s just nicer to you. Mostly. (Telling him was not \u2018nice\u2019 at all. Accepting how he treats you is not nice.)", "This has shown you not to confide in your mom", "Learn a lesson from this. Don't tell your mom anything you don't want others to know. Situations like this is how you learn who you can't trust.\n\nESH\n\nYou probably already knew whether your mom had loose lips? I'm guessing. \n\nSome spouses tell each other almost everything. Consider this for all future dealings. People in households generally share info because of house spent talking about everything and nothing. Stuff comes up.\n\nYour mom timed her confession to cause the most damage to you. Another thing to consider. \n\nIf you want a secret that big to stay secret, keep it to yourself. Keep your own council. \n\nYelling at your mom wasn't great. You should have hit her with the calm and quiet, I'm disappointed in you. The impact of those words a far reaching and convey the hurt better than yelled angry words.", "Shouldn't have told your mother.

I remember having the door open when I was at my ex\u2019s house but even when you\u2019re alone???????? Fuck that is so toxic you\u2019re a young woman you deserve a private space everyone does", "I think the most fitting judgement that lines up with this sub's options is ESH\n\nYou should not have expected your mum to keep a secret from her husband. Especially if their relationship is as conservative as you describe.\n\nYour mum would have known that she was stirring trouble when she told your dad especially if she did it with other relatives around.\n\nNow you know that you need to keep secrets from **both** your parents. You can't trust your mum. It is sad but there you are. If you have resigned yourself to living a closeted life, heartbreaking as that will be, then you need to accept that you need to keep a lot of things from your family. \n\nOthers might tell you to live your truth, come out even if it means that you lose contact with your family.

I can't believe it was a huge surprise your mother refused to keep something from your Dad.  Conservatives tend to hang together.
