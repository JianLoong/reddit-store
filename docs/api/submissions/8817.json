For example, many people would not be ok with their spouse looking through their phone, even if they have nothing to hide. Likewise, It seems like for the wife, the handbag is a boundary for her.", "If he sneezed and she wasn't there with her purse, would he not have found another solution to the problem? Would he have just sat there snotty and begged her to drive over and give him a tissue?", "Is that what happened to you when you sneeze? I sneeze sometimes and there\u2019s usually no Kleenex in arm\u2019s reach when I do and it\u2019s fine. If you\u2019re a snotty sneezer you should carry your own Kleenex. A sneeze is not an emergency. My SO is an adult and I\u2019m sure he can figure out sneezing without my help, so yes, I\u2019m fine with it. \n\nIf they had previously discussed this and she said \u201csure, if you ever need anything from my purse feel free to grab it\u201d I\u2019m sure OP would have mentioned it.", "For me, it's not a privacy issue. My husband knows he is not to go in my bag, because he'll never find anything in there, and because I have a system to be able to find what I need in the giant tote. Do not fuck with my system. I'm the one who has to deal with not being able to find my wallet, my work badge, and other essentials after it's been rummaged through. I made it very clear that if he needs something from it, ask me to get it or just bring me the bag.", "You can be in a happy healthy relationship and still want some privacy.", "Married people also deserve privacy from each other. I trust my husband and he trusts me, which is why we both deserve our own space to have our own shit that the other doesn\u2019t need to access.", "No way they\u2019ve made it to marriage and he doesn\u2019t know to stay out.", "Mm I don\u2019t think it\u2019s always that serious. Some people just have an expectation of privacy in certain situations, and having that breached, even if it\u2019s totally innocent on all sides, feels unpleasant.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like she freaked out. OP just said she looked irritated. I don\u2019t think she needs therapy because she doesn\u2019t like anyone else rooting around in her purse.", "Nah dog, I just don't like feeling like I'm not entitled to my own personal space. I'm not a child in a punitive home, getting my shit searched regularly. I'm his partner, I'm entitled to my own belongings and privacy just as he is.", "I suggested he leave his wife and people thought I lost my mind. But you articulated the situation better than I did. There are some underlying issues if she gets upset for him briefly going into her bag for a specific item.", "I wouldn\u2019t reach into my partner\u2019s pants pockets even if he weren\u2019t wearing them. They\u2019re his pockets, his stuff in them.", "Lots of men carry handbags? Bullshit", "Going into someone\u2019s bag is a violation of personal space without consent.", "Not to this crowd. Once they don\u2019t like an OP, it\u2019s a wrap. Fuck logic.", "\"I don't have anything to hide\" is not at all the same thing as \"I don't have an intrinsic right to privacy,\" bruh.", "Don\u2019t conflate privacy with secrecy.", "She doesn\u2019t have anything to hide either otherwise she would not have left her purse. But that **does NOT** give you permission to violate her privacy. YTA.", "He\u2019s not going through her personal belongings. He is reaching for a tissue. What is she hiding?", "There\u2019s just some contexts in which you assume you\u2019ll have privacy. I had to get actually angry with my SO before he quit walking in on me in the bathroom. I\u2019m not doing anything crazy in there, I just want to be able to pick at an ingrown hair or make my belly button talk or something without someone walking in on me. I\u2019m the same with my phone - I\u2019m not saying anything bad, I just want to be able to have a text convo with my friend without an unexpected audience. \n\nI\u2019m not possessive over my purse, but I can understand the feeling. Everyone can have privacy. It\u2019s a separate word from secrecy for a reason.", "Not trying to hide anything. But my purse is private. Just like my journal is private. Just like being in the bathroom is private. There are some things that are just personal and private. \n\nIf you're not the same way, then that's fine, but there's nothing wrong with having things that are private. It doesn't automatically mean you have something to hide.", "Good question - I'm a married woman and yes my husband can, and does, go into my purse. Half the time to get something I asked him for.   \n\n\nTo answer your question, I can only think of a man's wallet as being an equivalent?", "I guess his pants pockets (not while he\u2019s wearing them.) Thanks to the cavernousness of mens\u2019 pants pockets, my partner can fit a lot of crap in there - receipts, small tools, keys, wallet, gum, the one loonie i need to do laundry, lighter (in our smoking days.) I\u2019ve never just reached on in there. They\u2019re his pockets, it would just never occur to me. I\u2019d just ask him and he\u2019d tell me to check, then I\u2019d feel fine. \n\nJust a few weeks ago actually I needed laundry change while he wasn\u2019t home, and I texted him to ask if he had any stashed anywhere. I didn\u2019t go in his pockets without asking. \n\nTo me it has the same feeling as walking into someone else\u2019s house without being explicitly welcomed. Have you ever expected company and when they arrived at the time they just walked in and it made you feel weird? Like the convention is to knock and be welcomed, not just walk in, even though you want them there and expected them. \nOr have you had someone give you a blanket \u201cjust pop in anytime!\u201d And you know they mean it but you can\u2019t bring yourself to do it so you always knock? \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s the closest thing I can compare it to. It\u2019s just a boundary some people have and it feels uncomfortable when someone crosses it.", "Haha right?! Like DIVORCE because his wife was annoyed he went in her bag?! These people are wiiiiiild!!", "What\u2019s crazy about it? there\u2019s a good chance that she is hiding stuff or she doesn\u2019t trust him. It\u2019s highly dysfunctional to get mad at your spouse for going into your bag to get a tissue.", "I genuinely don't understand it when my fellow dudes get like this. It's a bag, not the sacred ark of the girl covenant or contagious or something. I hold my wife's purse often when she goes to do something real quick and doesn't want or need to carry it with her. No big deal. \n\nThat said, I don't go snooping. It's hers, not mine.", "what makes you think he can get a tissue without digging through her bag??", "he didn't say anything about that much less give past history as evidence for his expectations\n\nand in his other comments he's saying he doesn't understand why anyone needs privacy if they don't have anything to hide\n\nyou generally don't manage to date someone, get engaged, and get married, without knowing their basic boundaries", "Obviously not! If she did take it with her to the bathroom he would have no option but to find another solution... But she didn't take her purse with her and he KNEW she has some.\nAre you implying he should have went to the bathroom as oppose to reaching over a seat?\n(I realize now you neant not with her altogether, So I'll clarify again, in that situation he would HAVE to go the bathroom for some, or even ask behind the counter)", "Honestly sometimes, so I was projecting. But should that be the only reason to go in your partner's bag? \"An emergency\" If she has boundaries with her bag (which she apparently has) she should have stated so with her husband \nSo that just tells me they haven't discussed it and this was a first time situation. (Or of course OP is hiding that fact bc he's in the wrong)\nI just can't get over the feeling that looking for something that you know your partner has... Isn't a huge deal and your first comment just made it sound like he made an obvious mistake with a random and not someone he made a lifelong commitment to.", "Maybe he forgot Kleenex. Nobody is perfect.", "Ah yes, you never mess with a good system! \n\nFor me, if my partner needs something from my purse, there\u2019s an 80% chance he\u2019s going to forget to put it back. If he doesn\u2019t tell me about it, I\u2019m not going to know my wallet/keys/chapstick is missing until the moment i need it.", "My husband won't go into my bag, or my phone,  even if I ask him to, he'll just bring it to me.  This was alwys how it was in my family; my father didn't go into my mother's bag,  my grandfather didn't go into my grandmother's. This was my family, although I knew others may or not be the same.  Funny thing is, my husband is Japanese, from Japan, and it was the same in his family! Lol. Conversely, I don't dig through my husband's wallet or phone.", "Eh, taking the purse away and acting irritated about your spouse getting something out of your bag just seems like an overboard reaction to me. Seems to indicate some trust issues that need to be addressed. But sure, if OP\u2019s relationship works fine other than this, ignoring it will probably be ok.", "But we\u2019re not talking about that situation. OP literally went to grab Kleenex. If he was snooping that\u2019s a totally different situation than what OP described.", "Leaving her over this seems a bit extreme, assuming that this is the only issue, but the secretiveness she exhibits definitely seems concerning.", "What if he had something you needed? Maybe he had a nail clipper in there or change for the meter or something.", "I take it you don\u2019t get out much.", "It was his wife and he was just getting a Kleenex. What is the point of having a relationship if you can\u2019t grab a Kleenex from your wife without getting a court order?", "you don't go through someone else's shit without their permission - handbag, computer bag, backpack, wallet, pockets, etc\n\nit's not a difficult concept to grasp\n\nit's a basic boundary and one people can lower as they wish", "I understand what you\u2019re saying but see it differently I guess. We have no \u201cmine\u201d or \u201cyours\u201d in my relationship. People coming over or popping in and stuff I get and agree with you 100%. BUT, I\u2019m not married to those people. I don\u2019t share finances, children, my bed, etc. with those people. I guess I\u2019ve gotten spoiled by my situation, like how my relationship works with my wife. Absolute trust in a partner is what I\u2019m getting at. She\u2019s seen me at my best and worst and vice versa so we have literally nothing to hide because we\u2019ve seen the whole spectrum in the other.", "It\u2019s just how purses are made. They aren\u2019t open bowls, they\u2019re bags. You have to reach in to find something and the thing you need is almost never at the top.", "Because there\u2019s a difference between:\n\nOpen bag, spot tissues, grab tissues\n\nAnd\n\nOpen bag, root around looking for secrets", "Yeah, I am. If he had prior permission to go through her bag then that's fine. But clearly he didn't, and she didn't like that. Next time he should go to the bathroom. When I don't have a tissue on me I go to the washroom over searching through my partner's coat pockets or backpack.", "Well, yeah. I do feel like it\u2019s an obvious mistake. Even people in partnerships deserve privacy, and a purse is an obvious place to start. I wouldn\u2019t go in my partner\u2019s pants pockets, his phone or his computer without asking, either. Just don\u2019t got though someone else\u2019s stuff without asking first - it\u2019s a super easy guideline to follow.", "And the appropriate reaction to that would be \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I had a really wet sneeze and I didn\u2019t have a Kleenex,\u201d not, \u201cgee I better get on Reddit and see if I can get a bunch of strangers to call my gf an asshole for not liking me rooting around her purse.\u201d", "That\u2019s the most mild reaction I can think of to being displeased about someone going through your stuff. It\u2019s probably not a trust issue, it\u2019s just a boundary issue, and people are allowed to have those. \u201cDon\u2019t go into my purse without asking\u201d is hardly unreasonable.", "I didn't say that OP *was* snooping, you said there's no reason why someone would mind their spouse going through their purse unless they have issues, I said that other people going through my stuff without asking first makes me feel like I'm a child being searched regardless of that person's intent. People don't  need to be hiding anything to want respect for their privacy.", "If my wife freaked out over something like this, I would think she doesn\u2019t trust me. That\u2019s the end of the relationship. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to pack my bags; but I would start to seriously examine the whole relationship.", "I would just ask him first.\n\nFunny you should say that, I actually did need laundry change recently. My partner wasn\u2019t home but I figured there was a good chance he had some spare change stashed in a pocket somewhere. I texted him to ask.", "Then I would ask. I don't rifle through my spouse's things without asking him.", "I live in a major metropolitan city, and go out regularly. You're full of shit.", "You don't need a court order - you just need to say \"hey, honey, can I have a kleenex?\" and she'll either pass you one or say \"they're in my bag, you can grab one\". If she's not there, because she's in the bathroom, then you get to wait for her. She won't be long.\n\nOr you could have brought tissues in your own pockets.", "It\u2019s not about hiding anything, though. It\u2019s about having a sense that some things are private. Not secret, just \u201cyours\u201d. Trust has a function there, too. I trust my partner to respect my privacy. \n\nI can conceive that some people have zero desire for privacy and boundaries (where their partner is concerned) but not everyone is like that, and it\u2019s not a matter or trust or secrecy or hiding things, it\u2019s just something you either or aren\u2019t comfortable with for reasons that are probably too complicated to even fathom.  \n\nLike how one couple is comfortable sharing a toothbrush and another isn\u2019t. Some will pee with the door open and others won\u2019t. It\u2019s just part of the diversity of normal human behaviour.", "yup. not to mention all the different compartments. even if it's in the main bag you're probably gonna have to dig through it, and tissues are often kept in side pouches or zip pockets", "you either 1. don't actually have a purse/bag in your daily life or 2. have the most organized and immovable purse known to man and I envy you. \n\ni am the sole person going in and out of my bag on a daily  basis and i can't find *bupkas* in there on the first try. *everything* requires digging around. that's just how the purse works.", "If she made it clear she didn't want him in her bag without permission, this wouldn't have happened. You and the other person I replied to agrees that you shouldn't go through your partner purse/coat without permission as a prerequisite. Whereas I along with the OP didn't see the problem bc there wasn't a clear boundary OR malicious intent. And now that he knows she dislikes that it shouldn't happen again.\n\nYou're example isn't the same. I'm trying to stress the fact he knew she had them, he wasn't rummaging blindly. Why go to the bathroom if your wife has some in her purse (your answer is privacy/permission/boundaries). He just wasn't patient enough to wait for her... Dude sneezed if he needed a Kleenex I'm guessing there's some snot and he couldn't wait.\n(Deleted my last question bc it's beside the point)", "Speaking of appropriate reactions; the proper reaction to her husband getting a Kleenex would\u2019ve been to do nothing. Not throw a fit and act like he\u2019s looking through her diary.", "I guess anything can be a boundary, but it doesn\u2019t make it reasonable. And declaring a purse or any other container or bag as off limits to a spouse is fairly unreasonable. It absolutely says there\u2019s trust issues.", "So the wife is being overdramatic for taking her bag back and being irritated he looked through it, but you are being totally rational and normal by suggesting the mere fact she was irritated he went through her bag means he should immediately divorce her. Cool, very normal.", "You sound angry. Maybe stop looking down at your phone as you make your way around the city.", "Why do you expect him to bring his own tissues when you can\u2019t be bothered to even read the OP? She was in the bathroom and he had to sneeze. So he couldn\u2019t ask her.\n\nIf I ever get married, I would want there to be a level of trust where my wife didn\u2019t freak out because I reached into to her handbag for a tissue.", "she was in the bathroom when he sneezed??", "My purse is one compartment, I carry three things in it (wallet, phone, keys - sometimes chapstick). I still sometimes have to remove of those items to find the third. There is zero chance that that Kleenex was just floating on top of her purse.", "My point is there is a difference between going in for a specific, common item, and going in to snoop for no reason", "She actually literally did do nothing it. She didn\u2019t throw a fit. You\u2019re just making things up to support your weirdly dramatic feelings about this.", "Why do you feel it's ok to search through her purse but not her diary? What makes you think a diary is automatically more deserving or privacy than a purse?", "It doesn\u2019t. I guess if you haven\u2019t felt it yourself you can\u2019t really get it, but it\u2019s not (or not necessarily) a trust issue. It\u2019s closer to a feeling of respect about your stuff than trust/mistrust, like I wouldn\u2019t mess with my partner\u2019s hobby supplies without asking, rifle through his pockets, or use his computer, or read his text messages on his phone. I know for sure that he\u2019d have no problem with me doing any of that, so it\u2019s not \u201coff limits,\u201d but I still have a sense of respect that that\u2019s \u201chis,\u201d and wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable doing it.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really mean anything, like there\u2019s no thought behind it. It\u2019s just, I guess, the way we are.", "OP\u2019s didn\u2019t freak out, she just looked irritated. OP grabbing a Kleenex wasn\u2019t a big deal and neither was her reaction.", "so the intention makes the difference?\n\nit's fine to root around in someone's purse if you're just looking for tissues and stop as soon as you find the issues\n\nbut if you don't actually need anything from the purse then going through it is bad??\n\nbruh, you're violating someone's privacy and boundaries either way, the why doesn't matter", "I would call rushing to grab the bag before he could get a Kleenex, having an irritated look and then telling him it\u2019s private\u2026 A freakout. \n\nAnd it\u2019s sus as hell."]}
