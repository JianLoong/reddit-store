Full on yelling through the end of the sneeze. It always startles me which makes me agitated or irritated. Part of my irritation is not understanding how it\u2019s even possible to sneeze so loud. \n\nThe thing is, he can totally control how loud he sneezes. If we\u2019re in public, say in a store or restaurant, he definitely muffles the sound or holds back on the yelling so all you hear is the actual sneeze. He never holds back while at home and does not care that he startles us.\n\nI feel like it definitely is possible to control your sneezes so they\u2019re not ridiculously loud but still effective.\n\nEDIT TO ADD:\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not saying loud sneezers need to stop sneezing or hold their sneezes, that\u2019s painful and unnecessary. It\u2019s the yelling/screaming part that is the main issue and absolutely can be controlled. As another comment mentioned, a sneeze does not require your vocal cords at all.", "INFO- I'm a pretty loud sneezer myself but if I cover my sneeze with my inner elbow it dampens the noise significantly. Does she cover her mouth and nose properly?", "I'm a loud sneezer. I sneeze into my arm to muffle the sound. I always cover my nose and mouth when sneezing,  that helps.

Vocal cords do not need to be engaged to sneeze.", "Sneeze louder to assert dominance.", "Scream-sneezing is 100% a choice someone makes consciously. My hubby does it, but not when it would be stupendously inappropriate so I know it's within his control, which makes it more annoying when it happens.

If I hold it or try to control it  the pressure of the sneeze will hurt everything in my body.", "Serial sneezer here. By that, I mean I sneeze 5 times or more in direct succession.

She told you she\u2019s tired of people shaming her for something she can\u2019t control.

I know exactly what you're talking about. I've known people that scream while sneezing. Screaming is not a part of sneezing. Yes, it's not good to stifle your sneezes.

I don't get the screaming tho (if you meant that literally), for me personally, my sneezes are just ridiculously strong & I know I make some noise when they come out, I'm not yelling tho\n\nI do agree tho, that the loud sneezer should at least try to put something in front of their mouth/face in shared spaces", "As a loud, uncontrollable sneezer myself: you can totally muffle your sneezes, and you definitely don't need to scream.

Sneezing is involuntary and if that\u2019s how she goes, it is what it is.", "NTA, it's controllable. My sneezes are very silent, like a mouse sneezed, but sometimes when they catch me off-guard and I'm feeling silly, I almost yell when I sneeze.   So it's totally controllable.

In public or polite company, I try to do a quieter (albeit higher-pitched) sneeze that is significantly less disruptive. \n\nIt is really not that difficult. *Occasionally* a sneeze will come out of absolutely nowhere, take me by surprise, and come out vocally however it wants to. But that's pretty rare for me at least. And though it sometimes can be much louder and more forceful than expected, it's *never* just naturally come out as anything even remotely close to a *scream*. \n\nAlso, to do a lunatic, destructive scream sneeze, you have to pretty deliberately open your mouth as wide as you can and push the sneeze out as forcefully as humanly possible while also vocalizing at the top of your lungs for literally the entire process.

I'm not crazy loud but there's definitely noise, it's involuntary and part of the sneeze.", "The original commenter isn't kidding. It really hurts when you try to keep a sneeze quiet especially if you've got a powerful sneeze.

You're just not putting the full, unadulterated force of your vocal chords behind it by explosively forcing it out rather than just letting it happen. \n\nIt's like the difference between letting a natural fart just slip out unhindered and *actively pushing* that fart out as forcefully as humanly possible. The first way can still of course end up being loud. But the second way all but *guarantees* excessive noise.

And God forbid if you did it in front of all of the other kids and couldn\u2019t blame it on anyone else \u2014 because they would tease you about it for the next year at least. I can totally understand why being traumatized by farting in public at age 7 would still be something a woman was scared of today.", "im in my 30s and was \"taught\" by my stepmother and father how i should be and act to be a real lady. i was more of a tomboy when i was a teenager and i have literally been told that i was not worthy of love for things like not wearing dresses or such. i have been told many times that it absolutely didnt matter how things like high heels were badly hurting me and causing me health issues as long as i was looking sexy. i am old enough to know how it has been and still is to be a girl. its not that old, and its far from being gone. \n\nbut its not exactly more feminine and delicate to loudly yell when you sneeze; as a delicate female, you are supposed to sneeze sounds like a little mouse.", "My mom used to tell the story of being a kid in parochial school (maybe 5th grade?) and much to her horror she suddenly burped, sneezed, and farted, all at the same time. The nun/teacher wasn\u2019t pleased.", "still taught.\n\nrecent reddit--boyfriend harangued poster for HUMILIATING him by farting at a party(and not apologizing to THEM and separately to HIM).  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1831j1b/aita\\_for\\_not\\_apologising\\_to\\_my\\_bf\\_for\\_farting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1831j1b/aita_for_not_apologising_to_my_bf_for_farting/)\n\nrecent(years not days) various articles/reports of men divorcing women over their farting(1st time in 9 yrs one title says).\n\nAnd a relative married a man who stated that his FIRST WIFE never farted their entire marriage(jeez wonder why she cheated and divorced him?????)", "Yep! My mother would lose her mind if I did it in front of someone. Even at home. It was absolutely unacceptable for a girl and there's no way she'd ever change her mind. Even now that I'm middle aged, she would still be embarrassed and ashamed if I did it. Even if it was just the two of us. (Unless I was EXTREMELY apologetic and ashamed of myself)", "100% NOT A MYTH. I personally blew out an ear drum while in the Air Force bucause my commanding officer gave me an order to not sneeze so loudly. Thankfully the doctors have been able to restore most of my hearing on that ear.", "LOL no it's not. We had a guy who had to be taken to the effing hospital cause he held his sneeze. One should not ever hold them. And no, they're not controlable if they are intense. If you just have weak juice sneezes like a baby, sure you can control them, but everyone dont have their sneezes that weak like you do.", "I usually try to leave the room if I have to sneeze loudly but it does not always work.", "I remember a friend of mine getting in a fight. He had a black eye and suppressed a sneeze (closed his nose with his fingers) and the skin around his eye blew up like a balloon and remained that way until he fully healed.", "I was being totally genuine when I asked that LOL thank you!!", "We just went through a pandemic where it was recommended to sneeze into your elbows though?"]}
