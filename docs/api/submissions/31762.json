If we\u2019re in public, say in a store or restaurant, he definitely muffles the sound or holds back on the yelling so all you hear is the actual sneeze.

In public or polite company, I try to do a quieter (albeit higher-pitched) sneeze that is significantly less disruptive. \n\nIt is really not that difficult. *Occasionally* a sneeze will come out of absolutely nowhere, take me by surprise, and come out vocally however it wants to. But that's pretty rare for me at least. And though it sometimes can be much louder and more forceful than expected, it's *never* just naturally come out as anything even remotely close to a *scream*. \n\nAlso, to do a lunatic, destructive scream sneeze, you have to pretty deliberately open your mouth as wide as you can and push the sneeze out as forcefully as humanly possible while also vocalizing at the top of your lungs for literally the entire process.

I'm not crazy loud but there's definitely noise, it's involuntary and part of the sneeze.", "The original commenter isn't kidding. It really hurts when you try to keep a sneeze quiet especially if you've got a powerful sneeze.

You're just not putting the full, unadulterated force of your vocal chords behind it. \n\nIt's like the difference between letting a natural fart just slip out unhindered and *actively pushing* that fart out as forcefully as humanly possible. The first way can still of course end up being loud. But the second way all but *guarantees* excessive noise.
