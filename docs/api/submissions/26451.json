My father agreed to it. My mother, my stepfather and me then moved about 3 hours by car away from the city my father lived in. My dad had other partners and kids but I would still visit my father about every other weekend and on half of the holidays and he would always come to pick me up and then drop me of.\n\n\r  \nThe last partner of my father didn\u00b4t particularly like me (I think she was jealous of me because of the fun time we had with my father) but everything was civil. Only problem was that I have a kind of bad cat allergy that causes me skin problems and she insisted on the cat being inside, which I tolerated but asked them if it would be possible not to let the cat in my room. They had no problem with that but almost every time I visited, I knew the cat was in my room because I always had the skin problems there and sometimes, I even saw it run from there and once it was on my pillow. \n\n\r  \nIn the time I was 14 my father (well financially off) was buying a summer house that was not too far away from his house. After coming home with bad skin problems in my face (I wouldn\u00b4t go to school because of it) I wrote him an email asking if we could spend our time at the summer house because I really couldn\u00b4t handle the skin problems anymore and if it would not be possible, I wouldn\u2019t be visiting him. He answered that in the case we won\u00b4t see each other for some time. I got angry and since then I hadn\u00b4t seen my father and for a while I went VLC with him and NC after few years.\n\n\r  \nHere comes the part where I might be TA. In the years my father sometimes send me emails but usually he would be berating me about something I did wrong (supposedly didn\u00b4t greet someone on the street, spelling a word wrong in an answer I send him or not getting an vaccine against allergies?,..). After these emails there were other where he was trying to be nice and asking me to answer etc. (even trying to bribe me with money \u2013 that I could be traveling with him if I talked to him). Which in my opinion was too little and too late and I was a completely different person with my life without him in it. He never once apologized and some people that know both of us think that it should be me who apologizes. But I think that 1) I was a little kid and he was the adult at the time, 2) I do not need him in my life and if he wanted to be a part of it he should have done something and 3) I have an father (step dad) who cared for me for most of my life and always was there for me \u2013 not just the fun parts. Most people in my life either think that I\u00b4m in the right or do not comment on the situation but some say I\u00b4m TA for not trying to make things good with my father and not apologizing. In my mind though I cannot even imagine going back to having good relationship with my father.

But you were 14. And at that age it\u2019s your dad\u2019s responsibility to parent you on that. \n\nNot just that, but the reason you set that ultimatum was because his partner and he would not respect a very reasonable boundary. To not have the cat in your room and on your bed, because of allergies.\n\nThe fact that he helped create you, does not entitle him to contact. Especially if he doesn\u2019t want the full job of being your dad. You can choose the people in your life, based on what you feel is good for you.\n\nIf you want contact, that\u2019s up to you. I think from your story that he does. Family doesn\u2019t equal blood. And you know who it is you consider family.\n\nBut do consider that in the future you might want some sort of connection with your bio father. If so, you might want to mend your relationship. Even if he\u2019s never really going to feel like your dad.\n\nAnd when that\u2019s the case, it really doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s the asshole. Then it matters you tell him how the past made you feel. And ask him how things made him feel. And talk it over and see if there\u2019s some common ground you can work with. Because that\u2019s what matters, not who is ultimately to blame for the situation\u2026 \n\nThere\u2019s a difference between apologizing for your part in a situation you created together, or being the one who needs to apologize.\n\nI don\u2019t know if that made sense to you.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA. Dad prioritized cat and GF over you. No reason to apologize.", "NTA. Nice guy your Dad\ud83d\ude33", "NTA, first of all, what kind of a father would allow someone to take their kid hours away from them? Right away he is an asshole. Second, he is putting his wife\u2019s comfort OVER your health condition! What kind of a dad does that? A bad one. \n\nThird, if you want to have a relationship with him, then you need to establish boundaries, talk to him without any interruptions on how u feel about him and why you went no contact. Also, he needs to apologize.", "Apologize for what? For not wanting to be covered in a skin rash because your Father's Wife deliberately let the cat in your room, on your bed, etc?  No, your Father needs to apologize, profusely! You are NTA and those that are saying you are? VLC to NC works well for them too!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Stay NC with bio dad and let SD be the father figure he already is.", "NTA. He literally chose his girlfriend's cat over his daughter.", "NTA- You don't have to make up for your dad's shortcomings.", "NTA, and some people are parents by biology only. If your life is happier without him in it, no reason to resume contact. He chose his new family over you, so I don't know why he's complaining now that you've done the same thing.", "No, you're not an asshole for wanting no contact. He sounds self centered and manipulative still if not outright abusive. It's best to just move on without him.", "NTA.\n\nThe takeaway from your story is that your stepmother obviously let the cat into your room. Deliberately, right?\n\nAnd your father did nothing to prevent that.\n\nHe deserves NC. But you might want to at least consider telling him why. Not for his sake, but for yours. If you tell off the person who wronged you, chances are you will feel that you have resolved the matter.", "NTA. You were a child and he was the adult who put zero effort in when you were no longer convenient.", "NTA and there is no vaccine for cat allergies.  They should have at least kept the cat out of your room, or gotten rid of the damn thing altogether.", "Yta.", "NTA. He wasn't willing to put in a modicum of effort, he never apologized for the things he did, why should you bear the burden of \"making things right\"?", "NTA the ultimatum is the very responsible thing to do not to land in a hospital with an allergy or worse. \n\nDad was an ah who didn't bother setting his so straight at the cost of op s health. Medical negligence is little said.\n\n He has the consequences for it.", "I genuinely don't understand this mentality that ultimatums are \"irresponsible\" or one of the most horrible things you can do to someone. \n\nThis \"ultimatum\" that OP gave their father is actually just a boundary with a consequence. \"Dad, here is what I need to be comfortable. You have the choice of whether you want to accommodate that. If not, here's the consequences that will happen.\" This is *healthy* and *mature*. This is OP recognizing they were being mistreated and deciding to stand up for themselves over it.\n\nSure, boundaries (or what Reddit calls ultimatums) can be placed in bad faith or for abusive reasons, but even in that case, it just reveals an incompatibility that means the relationship isn't what it should be.", "r/foundthedad", "I get your point, and I agree with you. But I do think there are different types of ultimatums.\n\nFor me it\u2019s the difference between forcing a solution to a problem, or forcing your specific solution to a problem.\n\nBoundaries are responsible. Consequences to crossing boundaries are responsible.\n\nIt\u2019s connecting a consequence to the way you want to solve an issue, is the bit that\u2019s bugging me here.\n\nGoing: I feel like you don\u2019t respect my boundaries when it comes to the cat being in my room, causing me skin issues because of my allergies. If you want me to visit, you need to take this concern seriously. My solution would be to spend my visits at your holiday house, but if that doesn\u2019t work for you, I would like you to think about solution that would work for both of us. -> nothing wrong with an ultimatum like that.\n\nI will only visit if we spend our time together at your holiday home -> is only accepting a single solution to a problem, while there might be other solutions that would work.\n\nBut then again, I wasn\u2019t there. I only have my interpretation of a single side of an argument.\n\nThe point of my message was not if the ultimatum was or wasn\u2019t ok, but that OP has a choice if they want their bio father in their life. And if they do, then it\u2019s not really important what exactly happened and who exactly was wrong, but to find a common ground within the argument."]}
