My father agreed to it. My mother, my stepfather and me then moved about 3 hours by car away from the city my father lived in. My dad had other partners and kids but I would still visit my father about every other weekend and on half of the holidays and he would always come to pick me up and then drop me of.\n\n\r  \nThe last partner of my father didn\u00b4t particularly like me (I think she was jealous of me because of the fun time we had with my father) but everything was civil. Only problem was that I have a kind of bad cat allergy that causes me skin problems and she insisted on the cat being inside, which I tolerated but asked them if it would be possible not to let the cat in my room. They had no problem with that but almost every time I visited, I knew the cat was in my room because I always had the skin problems there and sometimes, I even saw it run from there and once it was on my pillow. \n\n\r  \nIn the time I was 14 my father (well financially off) was buying a summer house that was not too far away from his house. After coming home with bad skin problems in my face (I wouldn\u00b4t go to school because of it) I wrote him an email asking if we could spend our time at the summer house because I really couldn\u00b4t handle the skin problems anymore and if it would not be possible, I wouldn\u2019t be visiting him. He answered that in the case we won\u00b4t see each other for some time. I got angry and since then I hadn\u00b4t seen my father and for a while I went VLC with him and NC after few years.\n\n\r  \nHere comes the part where I might be TA. In the years my father sometimes send me emails but usually he would be berating me about something I did wrong (supposedly didn\u00b4t greet someone on the street, spelling a word wrong in an answer I send him or not getting an vaccine against allergies?,..). After these emails there were other where he was trying to be nice and asking me to answer etc. (even trying to bribe me with money \u2013 that I could be traveling with him if I talked to him). Which in my opinion was too little and too late and I was a completely different person with my life without him in it. He never once apologized and some people that know both of us think that it should be me who apologizes. But I think that 1) I was a little kid and he was the adult at the time, 2) I do not need him in my life and if he wanted to be a part of it he should have done something and 3) I have an father (step dad) who cared for me for most of my life and always was there for me \u2013 not just the fun parts. Most people in my life either think that I\u00b4m in the right or do not comment on the situation but some say I\u00b4m TA for not trying to make things good with my father and not apologizing. In my mind though I cannot even imagine going back to having good relationship with my father.

But you were 14. And at that age it\u2019s your dad\u2019s responsibility to parent you on that. \n\nNot just that, but the reason you set that ultimatum was because his partner and he would not respect a very reasonable boundary. To not have the cat in your room and on your bed, because of allergies.\n\nThe fact that he helped create you, does not entitle him to contact. Especially if he doesn\u2019t want the full job of being your dad. You can choose the people in your life, based on what you feel is good for you.\n\nIf you want contact, that\u2019s up to you. I think from your story that he does. Family doesn\u2019t equal blood. And you know who it is you consider family.\n\nBut do consider that in the future you might want some sort of connection with your bio father. If so, you might want to mend your relationship. Even if he\u2019s never really going to feel like your dad.\n\nAnd when that\u2019s the case, it really doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s the asshole. Then it matters you tell him how the past made you feel. And ask him how things made him feel. And talk it over and see if there\u2019s some common ground you can work with. Because that\u2019s what matters, not who is ultimately to blame for the situation\u2026 \n\nThere\u2019s a difference between apologizing for your part in a situation you created together, or being the one who needs to apologize.\n\nI don\u2019t know if that made sense to you.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA. Dad prioritized cat and GF over you. No reason to apologize.", "NTA. Nice guy your Dad\ud83d\ude33", "NTA, first of all, what kind of a father would allow someone to take their kid hours away from them? Right away he is an asshole. Second, he is putting his wife\u2019s comfort OVER your health condition! What kind of a dad does that? A bad one. \n\nThird, if you want to have a relationship with him, then you need to establish boundaries, talk to him without any interruptions on how u feel about him and why you went no contact. Also, he needs to apologize.", "Apologize for what? For not wanting to be covered in a skin rash because your Father's Wife deliberately let the cat in your room, on your bed, etc?  No, your Father needs to apologize, profusely! You are NTA and those that are saying you are? VLC to NC works well for them too!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
