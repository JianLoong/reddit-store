I know people who celebrate \u201cbirthday months\u201d in their 30\u2019s and it\u2019s the most obnoxious thing. Grow up. It\u2019s a grief ritual for his sister.

Are you saying he never celebrates your birthday, or he does but he also does the cake and happy birthday thing for his sister? If the former, then yes, a conversation about fitting in things to do on your birthday is probably a good idea. If the latter then I don't see what the problem is unless you want the entire day to revolve around you, which isn't going to happen even if he doesn't make the cake.

Yes, you are physically here, meaning he can celebrate your birthday with you any time. She is not. Her birthday is special to him. She was  special to him. Making a cake for her is special to him.

Is it inconvenient that you have the same birthday, sure. But, it is not as inconvenient as her being dead and her family not being able to celebrate her birthday WITH her.

Reason: you don't value what you have. you are in a relationship. You know this is important to him. Likely, he made a promise to himself or something similar.

It's his sister who passed away, and has been there ever since he was a little kid / when he was born, way longer than you two are together - and by the looks of it - probably will be together.\n\n It's his way of remembering her. Honestly, it is disrespectful that you'd ask him that and see him remembering his sister as something that's unfair to you.

I see this reaction often from people who've been lucky to never experience a loss on such a scale. \"Why can't you move on\", \"It's been so many years\", so on. It is never going to be enough years. His sister died when he was, what, 29-30, so I'll assume she was young as well. She was deeply loved and she was taken from him, from his entire family, and that injustice can never be remedied. You have to understand, this is not something you move on from. You just learn to live with the pain and manage. And he's going to be making that cake on his sister's birthday probably for as many years as he is able to. Understand it and accept it, for his sake. Please. Because if you tell him he has to move on, you'll only hurt him.\n\nYou're an adult. Adults celebrate their birthdays on other dates all the time due to various mundane life circumstances, the most common one being work.

That\u2019s where you might be the AH. You\u2019re not the AH for feeling how you feel. I don\u2019t think this is jealousy or that you want to compete with his sister; you just want to feel as important on your actual birthday to your bf.

You need to talk to him about finding a solution, this isn't going to go away. You shouldn't ask him to stop making his sister a cake but he shouldn't be ignoring your birthday in favor of hers. Sucks for him but he needs to find a way to celebrate both of you on your birthdays. If that means he makes two cakes, than he should do that.

I lost my dad on Thanksgiving but I\u2019m not the thief of joy every year at someone\u2019s turkey holiday. I\u2019m there to make new memories before other important people in my life die.

He sounds like a really great guy, and you\u2019re making a big deal about the fact that he makes an extra cake.", "What do you do to celebrate your day? \n\nHere\u2019s the deal. You are still here & can celebrate whatever day you want. If your birthday is a big deal to you then be with people who only want to recognize it\u2019s your day. Dave already had a tradition of celebrating this day by honoring his sister before he met you. If it\u2019s possible for you to share the day first half honor sister, second half honor you then maybe that could work. But you can\u2019t force him to change his tradition to fit your needs better because this day was about his sister first & now it\u2019s about him honoring her life. It also just happens to be your birthday. You\u2019re not the only person with that day. You gotta share. I think compromise is the way to go here or just spend the day with your family & let Dave do his thing.\n\neta \u2014 did both his sister & his BIL die suddenly?", "Ffs, OP, he doesn't full on mourn Victorian style for his sister on the day. It's a small, sweet ritual to remember someone who meant a lot to him, someone he'll love for his whole life even though they passed on.

I mean singing doesn\u2019t take long and cutting couple of slices and all that wouldn\u2019t take up that much time either. \n\nWhat about rest of that day? Do you guys celebrate your birthday then?", "I don't understand what your problem is.\n\nYou get *your* cake and he makes a cake for his sister, too, that he shares with *you* and then with others as well.\n\nWhat exactly isn't fair about this? That he sings Happy Birthday for his sister? Which takes, like, 20 seconds, if at all?\n\nYTA", "*Yours is the main one*\n\nSo you're mad he sings a song, basically? What is wrong with you?", "YTA, and a monumental a-hole at that.  FFS what is wrong with you?  You can\u2019t spare 15 minutes if your precious birthday so he can remember his sister and carry on his tradition he had LONG BEFORE MEETING YOU?!?  Im just gonna let you know that you\u2019re not a good person, in case you were under the delusion that you were.", "Sorry could you please elaborate on whats upsetting you then? I was under the impression he didn't want to celebrate your birthday because it was his sister's?", "Does he make your cake? Basically is he honoring your birthday as well as his sister's birthday? I think YTA is you push him to stop doing this when it sounds like a small part of the day. Not necessarily an AH just for asking.", "YTA.  How selfish you have to be to begrudge the man you supposedly love a few minutes to honor his late sister.  Love isn't a pie with finite slices.  What he does to remember his sister does not take away from what he feels for you.\n\nBut keep it up.  I'm sure he'll come to his senses soon and find someone more worthy.", "Eewwww this response is so icky!!! I hope your soon to be ex runs far and fast!

If he\u2019s baking you an elaborate cake, too, then I don\u2019t understand the problem.", "Sound like this is what would happen if the sister was still alive. Would you expect him to just ignore his sister\u2019s bd if she was around?", "Omfg the horror. Stop being selfish.", "Would your throw this much of a hissy fit if his sister was still alive, or would you understand that people can share birthdays? What I\u2019m trying to figure out is if you\u2019re an all round jealous control freak, or if you\u2019re just jealous of a DEAD sibling. Not sure which one is worse but either way YTA", "So you\u2019re mad that he sings a 30 second song on \u201cyour special day\u201d? Think about that. Think about how incredibly selfish you\u2019re being.", "YTA & very cruel.", "So\u2026 what\u2019s your problem exactly?

Unless it's someone that's close to me personally. Like my granddaughter was born on my birthday, so her birthday has and will always come first. If my husband's deceased sister's birthday fell on my birthday, I would expect my birthday to come first. She could be celebrated the day before or after my birthday. My father died on my sons birthday. I celebrate my sons birthday and grieve for my father on another day. The living should come before the deceased when days of honoring someone clash, imo. So, NTA.", "So why are you mad?", "And this is 15-minute is unbearable to you because...?", "You are definitely not too old to celebrate your birthday! However you are absolutely too old to be whining about a teeny amount of time to remember a dead woman.

They also sit down and eat some of his deceased sister's cake. Then he boxes it up and gives it away. So, it's not just singing happy birthday to his deceased sister and then on with celebrating her birthday. How depressing to start your own birthday year after year, ugh.
