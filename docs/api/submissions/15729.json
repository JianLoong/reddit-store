He said no, he's going to make the cake and do the routine he does every year.\n\nI said I get that, but this is my birthday and I'm actually here right now, and how many more years he's going to continue doing this.

I know people who celebrate \u201cbirthday months\u201d in their 30\u2019s and it\u2019s the most obnoxious thing. Grow up. It\u2019s a grief ritual for his sister.

Are you saying he never celebrates your birthday, or he does but he also does the cake and happy birthday thing for his sister? If the former, then yes, a conversation about fitting in things to do on your birthday is probably a good idea. If the latter then I don't see what the problem is unless you want the entire day to revolve around you, which isn't going to happen even if he doesn't make the cake.

Yes, you are physically here, meaning he can celebrate your birthday with you any time. She is not. Her birthday is special to him. She was  special to him. Making a cake for her is special to him.

Is it inconvenient that you have the same birthday, sure. But, it is not as inconvenient as her being dead and her family not being able to celebrate her birthday WITH her.

Reason: you don't value what you have. you are in a relationship. You know this is important to him. Likely, he made a promise to himself or something similar.

Honestly, it is disrespectful that you'd ask him that and see him remembering his sister as something that's unfair to you.

It is never going to be enough years. His sister died when he was, what, 29-30, so I'll assume she was young as well. She was deeply loved and she was taken from him, from his entire family, and that injustice can never be remedied. You have to understand, this is not something you move on from. You just learn to live with the pain and manage. And he's going to be making that cake on his sister's birthday probably for as many years as he is able to. Understand it and accept it, for his sake. Please. Because if you tell him he has to move on, you'll only hurt him.\n\nYou're an adult. Adults celebrate their birthdays on other dates all the time due to various mundane life circumstances, the most common one being work.

That\u2019s where you might be the AH. You\u2019re not the AH for feeling how you feel. I don\u2019t think this is jealousy or that you want to compete with his sister; you just want to feel as important on your actual birthday to your bf.

You need to talk to him about finding a solution, this isn't going to go away. You shouldn't ask him to stop making his sister a cake but he shouldn't be ignoring your birthday in favor of hers. Sucks for him but he needs to find a way to celebrate both of you on your birthdays. If that means he makes two cakes, than he should do that.

I lost my dad on Thanksgiving but I\u2019m not the thief of joy every year at someone\u2019s turkey holiday. I\u2019m there to make new memories before other important people in my life die.

That feels good now because I have 5 years to look back on and see how much time he took for me. \n\nBut before several years of proof of love and dedication, what bothered me was when he was super stable and overflowing financially, he lacked in taking me on regular dates in a new city he had me move to for him and that hurt me. \n\nSo when a major date finally came around, I felt anxious to squeeze the most out of it thinking \"well, this is it for the year until another holiday or christmas,\" so I addressed it within the first year. \n\nWe started out with a day out in the city once a week, and then we realized it was tiring. So we changed it to if we don't go out for up to a month to a few months consecutively, it is because he saved for something special. A trip or fancy fancy restaurant. \n\nSo we broke down what is important and what isn't. \nThis journey was a whole mess of feelings.  I addressed myself and found that >>\n\nI couldn't legally work that year, covid happened, I moved for him. \n\nAll of that made me feel >>\n\nLike I expected him to show me something to prove I wasn't just a girlfriend he gained and just kept around.\n\nAnd the core reason is >>\n\nThe bother was a combination of me feeling cooped in a new country and him not trying hard and often enough. That was exacerbated with a lot of family bs,  and it included snide remarks from his family members taking digs at me or him. \n\n\nSo honestly, I'd take a 15 min cake song on my bday to those digs any day. \n\nI get the annoyance, but it isn't from the 15 min song and dedication to a dead sibling.

The way you describe it is that nothing is different except he makes a cake and acknowledges his sisters bday ON HER BDAY which happens to also be yours. And he makes you a cake and celebrates you. It\u2019s incredibly cruel and entitled to expect him to just make up a random bday for his sister bc it\u2019s \u201cinconvenient\u201d for you to have one extra cake and song.

It sounds like you're more mad that he still loves, thinks, and cares for his deceased sister as I'd have a hard time imagining you putting up this kind of fit if she were still alive.", "I was thinking that too, my guess would be that OP has yet to lose someone profoundly important to them and therefore really can\u2019t grasp that a lot of us need to do all kinds of things to keep lost ones present somehow in order to stay sane.", "No he doesn't.  He makes both cakes the day before.  They do the sisters.  And then the wife.\n\nWho can eat 2 slices of cake that isn't under 15?", "The idea that a day where you are trying to celebrate or have a party for yourself or your accomplishments for the past year will always have the sorrow of his sisters death woven into it sounds heartbreaking.", "I agree with both of you here. There\u2019s something deeper going on on both sides. My guess is OP is wondering where she fits into fianc\u00e9\u2019s life if his sister\u2019s memory looms this large.

This is why \u2014even though Reddit likes to diss these responses \u2014 my response to situations is often that they should break up or get divorced.

I love birthdays. But I also understand that my birthday is just another day for many other people. I have met people that act like their birthday is the most important day of the year and they make that everyone's problem. Those people are obnoxious.

Thankfully we're able to celebrate each other's birthdays in whatever way the other person wants and it's not a problem.", "Birthdays are so over rated. Other countries don't even celebrate it.

I am also a \"it's important to mark the important days of those who are no longer with us\" person.

Every birthday is terrible.", "Amateurs.  I don\u2019t need an excuse to be insufferable.", "I get excited about my birthday because between physical and mental health issues, I legit didn't think I'd make it this far. I think the closest I've come to \"making\" folks celebrate with me was bringing a cake to the office and shooting out an email letting folks know it was available at X time and to come get some if they wanted. Whenever I found out that I was birthday twins with a friend of mine, I made sure that everyone knew that it was their birthday too and not just mine! There's enough joy and love to be shared, so I'm not sure why anyone would want to be stingy with it either.", "A woman I know (31) refused to do a favor for a friend, because it was her *BIRTHDAY MONTH.* \n\nDon't get me wrong.

Many girls just want to be a superstar for the day. And that's OK up to a point, but the term Bridezilla exists for a reason. Some ppl use these events to fuel their ego and its nothing other than narcissism.", "To me, birthdays are a day where people should be going the extra mile to show the birthday person they are grateful to have them in their lives. We do soooo little to celebrate people unless they are getting married or having babies. Yeah I expect a little extra effort from people on my birthday, it's a day I'd like people to maybe come and celebrate when if it was just a happy hour or anything else, they wouldn't. And yes, it kind of bothers me when people flake out on birthdays. I will always remember who came through on my birthday and who flaked. \n\nI also love celebrating birthdays together, I have a friend who has a birthday very close to mine, I like it when we can throw a celebration together. I expect my partner to write me a nice card or take a moment and tell me why I am special to him, and of course take me out to do something nice. I think a big part of it is a love language thing too. Celebrate yourself, celebrate those important to you. \n\nIt's not a free pass to be a dick, and your birthday does not supersede other birthdays or important events on that day. For a long time my partner had a friend with the same birthday as me.

I've had people show up at a party with a birthday within a few days of mine. I had no problem \"sharing\" even my birthday party with them. BFD. At 36 years old she should be more mature on this.

Obviously since he does this his sister meant a lot to him. \n\nAlso it doesn\u2019t have to be super grim they can remember the happy things.

None of this was planned beyond \"I'm bringing donuts!\" etc. We all had fun and everyone felt seen and appreciated.  I thought it was cool out of 16 people we had three with the same birthday and one with a birthday the next day and we celebrated that.
