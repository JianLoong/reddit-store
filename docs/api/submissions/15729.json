I asked Dave if we could do his sister's celebration on a different day. He said no, he's going to make the cake and do the routine he does every year.\n\nI said I get that, but this is my birthday and I'm actually here right now, and how many more years he's going to continue doing this. He got mad at me and replied that I'm being disrespectful.

I know people who celebrate \u201cbirthday months\u201d in their 30\u2019s and it\u2019s the most obnoxious thing. Grow up. It\u2019s a grief ritual for his sister.

Are you saying he never celebrates your birthday, or he does but he also does the cake and happy birthday thing for his sister? If the former, then yes, a conversation about fitting in things to do on your birthday is probably a good idea. If the latter then I don't see what the problem is unless you want the entire day to revolve around you, which isn't going to happen even if he doesn't make the cake.

Yes, you are physically here, meaning he can celebrate your birthday with you any time. She is not. Her birthday is special to him. She was  special to him. Making a cake for her is special to him.

Is it inconvenient that you have the same birthday, sure. But, it is not as inconvenient as her being dead and her family not being able to celebrate her birthday WITH her.

Reason: you don't value what you have. you are in a relationship. You know this is important to him. Likely, he made a promise to himself or something similar.

Honestly, it is disrespectful that you'd ask him that and see him remembering his sister as something that's unfair to you.

It is never going to be enough years. His sister died when he was, what, 29-30, so I'll assume she was young as well. She was deeply loved and she was taken from him, from his entire family, and that injustice can never be remedied. You have to understand, this is not something you move on from. You just learn to live with the pain and manage. And he's going to be making that cake on his sister's birthday probably for as many years as he is able to. Understand it and accept it, for his sake. Please. Because if you tell him he has to move on, you'll only hurt him.\n\nYou're an adult. Adults celebrate their birthdays on other dates all the time due to various mundane life circumstances, the most common one being work.

That\u2019s where you might be the AH. You\u2019re not the AH for feeling how you feel. I don\u2019t think this is jealousy or that you want to compete with his sister; you just want to feel as important on your actual birthday to your bf.

You need to talk to him about finding a solution, this isn't going to go away. You shouldn't ask him to stop making his sister a cake but he shouldn't be ignoring your birthday in favor of hers. Sucks for him but he needs to find a way to celebrate both of you on your birthdays. If that means he makes two cakes, than he should do that.

It\u2019s rather depressing this is how he celebrates your shared birthday. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be too pleased about that either. I lost my dad on Thanksgiving but I\u2019m not the thief of joy every year at someone\u2019s turkey holiday. I\u2019m there to make new memories before other important people in my life die.

It was a big deal for me since I never thought I would still be here (mental health struggles). \n\nEven though I didn\u2019t make it a huge fuss, my friends surprised me with a small party before we played DnD that night. It was perfectly subdued and fun. \n\nOP I guess was never taught to share, which explains why she doesn\u2019t want to even let her fianc\u00e9 acknowledge his sister for 5-10 damn minutes. I wonder if she\u2019s one of those, \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday month!\u201d?", "I don\u2019t think a lot of people would disagree with that but to be so wrapped up in your birthday you won\u2019t let your S/O spend 15 minutes remembering their dead sister is absolutely taking a birthday too far", "Right 365 days and billions of people\u2026 so everyone shares their birthday w hundreds of millions of still living people, plus even more recently deceased. \n\nWanting to enjoy your birthday, sure great!\n\nBehaving as if it\u2019s only your day\u2026 quite self-centered", "It\u2019s not about enjoying your birthday. It\u2019s a response to people that as adults act entitled and spoiled about their birthday. Like little kids would. The difference is a little kid doesn\u2019t get to decide what to do with their birthday. They\u2019re stuck doing whatever the grownups decide. \n\nAs an adult, if you want a party, you can organize one. If you want an experience, you can book it and invite who you want. Just two examples. But the point is, as an adult you can determine how you enjoy your day. \n\nBut you can\u2019t expect others to plan it for you (unless you ask/have an understanding) and you are supposed to understand that other adults have lives too and cannot center their life around yours. \n\nAs an adult, you are expected to manage your expectations and not get upset if everything is not about you. It\u2019s a development stage of childhood that you understand a child grappling with. But it is hard to feel sympathy for an adult who never managed to make it past that development stage.", "My birthday is right between two holidays where gifts are given if I don\u2019t have my birth-week I get forgotten lmao", "No dude, that's you. Unimportant, except to a few people.", "SooooOOoooOOooOooOOO, here's my birthday registry, feel free to pick more than one thing off of it....", "At her big age! I\u2019m in a state of shock at this BS", "I missed them. What\u2019d they say?", "I like Dave", "Then she should date someone who doesn\u2019t have anything else to think about on her birthday. She needs to make it clear in the first month of dating someone that her birthday needs to just be about her. No sadness or distractions allowed. The whole day needs to be dedicated to her and only her. Because grief from a tragedy has no place on HER day because it might spoil her mood.", "If you're more concerned about your birthday and the mood around it than supporting your fiance that's grieving the loss of a family member, YTA.", "That's so different, smh. He's not dictating how your birthday starts out every single year, year in and year out.", "Why don't you celebrate a dead stranger every morning, on every birthday, for the rest of your life then? Since it's not depressing to you.", "This is beautiful. I'm sorry for your losses.", "Big age! Ha, I like that. I\u2019m going to use it, definitely better than \u201cold\u201d", "They aren't deleted, just downvoted to oblivion. Click on OP's username at the top and it'll take you to their profile page with their comments.", "Dave is just out here making amazing cake & being kind. I like Dave too. We need more people like Dave in the world.", "He doesn't force her to grieve with him so no, he just does an extra cake for his dead sister and sings happy birthday, it must last smth like 10 minutes once a year?", "Maybe OP should ask him to tell happy stories about his sister. It doesn't have to be a downer. I love remembering the good times with my lost loved ones! It's bittersweet, but I wouldn't call it depressing.", "I love remembering MY loved ones, as well. I wouldn't make my husband   deal with my loss on his birthday every year though.", "If sister hadn\u2019t died, OP would just be sharing with her live SIL. \n\nMore than one person can have the same birthday.", "Then OP would actually know the sister, and she wouldn't be waking up to celebrate a dead person first, she doesn't even know, every year of her life. My granddaughter was born on my birthday.  When I'm gone, I won't need a birthday cake, every morning of her life from then on. That's ridiculous."]}
