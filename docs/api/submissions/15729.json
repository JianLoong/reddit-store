He said no, he's going to make the cake and do the routine he does every year.\n\nI said I get that, but this is my birthday and I'm actually here right now, and how many more years he's going to continue doing this.

I know people who celebrate \u201cbirthday months\u201d in their 30\u2019s and it\u2019s the most obnoxious thing. Grow up. It\u2019s a grief ritual for his sister.

If the former, then yes, a conversation about fitting in things to do on your birthday is probably a good idea. If the latter then I don't see what the problem is unless you want the entire day to revolve around you, which isn't going to happen even if he doesn't make the cake.

Yes, you are physically here, meaning he can celebrate your birthday with you any time. She is not. Her birthday is special to him. She was  special to him. Making a cake for her is special to him.

Is it inconvenient that you have the same birthday, sure. But, it is not as inconvenient as her being dead and her family not being able to celebrate her birthday WITH her.

Reason: you don't value what you have. you are in a relationship. You know this is important to him. Likely, he made a promise to himself or something similar.

Honestly, it is disrespectful that you'd ask him that and see him remembering his sister as something that's unfair to you.

It is never going to be enough years. His sister died when he was, what, 29-30, so I'll assume she was young as well. She was deeply loved and she was taken from him, from his entire family, and that injustice can never be remedied. You have to understand, this is not something you move on from. You just learn to live with the pain and manage. And he's going to be making that cake on his sister's birthday probably for as many years as he is able to. Understand it and accept it, for his sake.

Adults celebrate their birthdays on other dates all the time due to various mundane life circumstances, the most common one being work.

That\u2019s where you might be the AH. You\u2019re not the AH for feeling how you feel.

You need to talk to him about finding a solution, this isn't going to go away. You shouldn't ask him to stop making his sister a cake but he shouldn't be ignoring your birthday in favor of hers. Sucks for him but he needs to find a way to celebrate both of you on your birthdays. If that means he makes two cakes, than he should do that.

I lost my dad on Thanksgiving but I\u2019m not the thief of joy every year at someone\u2019s turkey holiday. I\u2019m there to make new memories before other important people in my life die.

That feels good now because I have 5 years to look back on and see how much time he took for me. \n\nBut before several years of proof of love and dedication, what bothered me was when he was super stable and overflowing financially, he lacked in taking me on regular dates in a new city he had me move to for him and that hurt me. \n\nSo when a major date finally came around, I felt anxious to squeeze the most out of it thinking \"well, this is it for the year until another holiday or christmas,\" so I addressed it within the first year. \n\nWe started out with a day out in the city once a week, and then we realized it was tiring. So we changed it to if we don't go out for up to a month to a few months consecutively, it is because he saved for something special. A trip or fancy fancy restaurant. \n\nSo we broke down what is important and what isn't. \nThis journey was a whole mess of feelings.  I addressed myself and found that >>\n\nI couldn't legally work that year, covid happened, I moved for him. \n\nAll of that made me feel >>\n\nLike I expected him to show me something to prove I wasn't just a girlfriend he gained and just kept around.\n\nAnd the core reason is >>\n\nThe bother was a combination of me feeling cooped in a new country and him not trying hard and often enough. That was exacerbated with a lot of family bs,  and it included snide remarks from his family members taking digs at me or him. \n\n\nSo honestly, I'd take a 15 min cake song on my bday to those digs any day. \n\nI get the annoyance, but it isn't from the 15 min song and dedication to a dead sibling.

You make it sound like he does a seance and summons his sister or something. All he's doing is celebrating her life, and the day she was born. He was going to do that regardless of if his wife had the same birthday, if she was born on any other day she wouldn't have a problem with but just cause it's her birthday she's mad, well it's also this guys sisters birthday, someone he grew up with, someone who left him too soon, and instead of mourning her death, he honors the life that she had, with the best cake his hands can make and a song. We have no idea where this guy is mentally when dedicating a couple hours out of a day to celebrate someone important to him. And his wife then proceeded to tell him that it's her day and that she's still alive so he should celebrate her instead. Both arguments are valid, I understand why the wife would feel a little neglected, I do think that it's self-centered tho, and I understand why the husband does this yearly for him and his sister. But I disagree with what you said specifically, not everything has to go her way, sometimes people need to feel uncomfortable with a decision that is made, the husband can't be the only one to compromise. And just cause you think there are better ways to do things, doesn't mean it's the better way for everyone.", "First off I just want to say I am so sorry for your loss. My heart goes out to you truly. As someone who has also lost my spouse I can say that it feels like half of me went with him. Your entire life changes in that moment. I\u2019m so sorry you have to experience that. That being said, I am honestly surprised to see you express your thoughts about how another person should be grieving. Everyone grieves differently and it\u2019s ok to grieve or remember your loved one as long as you need to and how you choose to, as long as it isn\u2019t unhealthy. This is obviously not unhealthy. I don\u2019t think anyone completely knows how it feels for anyone else to lose someone they love because we all handle grief in our own way. It affects us all differently. In my opinion the fianc\u00e9 should be allowed to grieve/honor his sister on sister\u2019s birthday. If it is important to him it should be important to OP as well. Being a supportive partner is equally as important. She is an adult not a child who can not understand sharing a birthday. We are adults who should understand the world doesn\u2019t stop and revolve around us just because it\u2019s our birthday. If it were a coworker and she had to share her birthday with another person at work would it make sense or sound rational to ask the people at work to disregard the other coworker and not get that coworker a cake or sing happy birthday to them bc this is her day\u2026despite it being their birthday too? It sounds pretty rude and self absorbed, right? \nFianc\u00e9 celebrates and honors OP\u2019s birthday all day. I see nothing wrong with letting him take a few moments to honor his sister as well. The fianc\u00e9 makes two elaborate cakes, one for sister and one for OP the day before. He sings Happy Birthday and enjoys a piece of cake in sister\u2019s memory. The rest of the day is completely devoted to OP. He was doing this long before OP came in to the picture and it is not news to her.

Go to a concert or hike or picnic or movie or amusement park or museum. Drive her somewhere beautiful or something. Tell her that she's amazing and you just wanted to celebrate her for a day without there having to be an occasion, because you both are in love and alive with eachother in this world for a finite amount of time, and deserve to share happy golden moments.

It's the gracious thing to do and a beautiful way to connect with Dave and strengthen the love between you two - it's how great communities are formed! \n\nYTA in this moment but you don't have to be the a-hole forever.

It is clearly a special tradition to him that he\u2019s established and it has probably helped him deal with his grief in a healthy way as well. It was a special tradition before you even came into the picture.
