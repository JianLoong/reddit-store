He and his ex decided to send 9m to a private prep school when he was 3 years old, and their agreement was he would continue to attend until kindergarten at which point he would go to a free public school. After they split up, they agreed to keep him at the private school until the end of primary school, and share the cost (with 50% being paid by my husband's father, and the other 50% split between my husband and his ex). By the time 9m started kindergarten, me and my husband were together, pregnant, and sharing finances. Our contribution to the school fees came out of our family account and by this time my FIL had stopped contributing so we were covering 50%.\n\nFast forward a few years and we now have two other children. We had wanted to send 3m to the same prep school (it is an international school and we want all the children to speak French as the family is French). We realised we would be unable to afford to send them both there, so decided against it. \n\nMy husband's ex has now decided she would like to keep 9m at the school for the remainder of his school years, which equates to another 9 years of private tuition fees.

My hope is that my husband and I can contribute to all 3 children equally.\n\nEDIT:\nTo clarify, the ex has said she will pay for stepsons tuition on her own if need be. Things aren't exactly amicable between she and my husband and it was said in such a way that insinuated we would be abandoning her and forcing her to pay on her own.\nI would NEVER stop this from happening, nor would I ever force my SS to change schools but at the end of the day, she changed the terms of the agreement. If she wants to proceed this way then so be it - I only expressed concern around how that narrative might play out and whether it might breed resentment between SS toward his father.

I think that the the dad should be funding all 3 kids evenly and fairly. \n\nMaybe the stepsons mom can try fill the gap to keep her kid in private school. Since she seems the most keen on keeping him in that school.\n\nHowever, even with those option OP is still concerned about the \"resentment\" that would cause.  sounds to me like they still won't be able to afford it if the ex paid the full amount."]}
