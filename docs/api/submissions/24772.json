He has a son (9m) from a previous relationship, and together we have two children (3m and 0m). He and his ex decided to send 9m to a private prep school when he was 3 years old, and their agreement was he would continue to attend until kindergarten at which point he would go to a free public school. After they split up, they agreed to keep him at the private school until the end of primary school, and share the cost (with 50% being paid by my husband's father, and the other 50% split between my husband and his ex). By the time 9m started kindergarten, me and my husband were together, pregnant, and sharing finances. Our contribution to the school fees came out of our family account and by this time my FIL had stopped contributing so we were covering 50%.\n\nFast forward a few years and we now have two other children. We had wanted to send 3m to the same prep school (it is an international school and we want all the children to speak French as the family is French). We realised we would be unable to afford to send them both there, so decided against it. \n\nMy husband's ex has now decided she would like to keep 9m at the school for the remainder of his school years, which equates to another 9 years of private tuition fees. I feel it is unfair to my other children (my biological ones) that they will not be afforded the same educational opportunity as their older brother, as we can't afford to send all 3 there. AITA for saying I no longer wish to contribute to 9m's school fees once he finishes primary school, and instead use that money to put into a savings account to put towards the other two children's education? My hope is that my husband and I can contribute to all 3 children equally.\n\nEDIT:\nTo clarify, the ex has said she will pay for stepsons tuition on her own if need be. Things aren't exactly amicable between she and my husband and it was said in such a way that insinuated we would be abandoning her and forcing her to pay on her own.\nI would NEVER stop this from happening, nor would I ever force my SS to change schools but at the end of the day, she changed the terms of the agreement. If she wants to proceed this way then so be it - I only expressed concern around how that narrative might play out and whether it might breed resentment between SS toward his father. The intent of this post was to clarify, AITA if I personally, as the stepmother, stop contributing my portion of the fees (e.g. 25%).", "created_utc": 1692183079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15smhqv/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_stepsons/", "score": 145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would be really careful with how you approach it though, changing schools is hard for kids and it could lead towards some resentment towards the younger two.", "NTA your husband has held to to the deal.

Good luck... oh and if the ex wants their kid in the school, help by giving her 100% of the cost \ud83e\udd23", "NAH (at least at this point).\n\nI think it's absolutely appropriate for you and your husband to contribute the same to each of your three children, and if you cannot afford to send all three to the private school then the answer is very clear - you send none of them.\n\nThat said, if the ex is willing to pay the tuition for the 9 year old on her own (or with outside help), you would be out of line to remove the 9 year old from the private school even though the other two will not have the same opportunity. \n\nYou have equal say in your household finances - make sure the discussion with your husband is clear and fair. I think you're on the right track.", "ESH both parents should be negotiating a parenting agreement that includes schooling. Ex cannot unilaterally decide schooling.

You married a man who already has obligations so you are TA for expecting him to drop those obligations.", "NTA. You all had an agreement, one that has been extended multiple times. You are not reneging on something already agreed upon, rather saying that you can\u2019t continue contributing past the original terms. Added on to that, at least one party int eh agreement (the FIL) is no longer contributing. In a shared parenting relationship, both parties are able to have a say. In this case, the stepson\u2019s continuation at this school is not financially feasible and is having an impact on the other children in the family.

If the mom is willing to pay the tuition herself without any input from either on you there is no issue.", "NTA, it's a fair assessment and the original agreement was for kindergarten. To ensure fairness and respect continuity, I'd carry on for primary school only. Ensure the children all converse in French and English both in and out of schooling, keep the environment as immersive as possible. Those early years, their brains are sponges and they learn stuff so quickly! \n\nApproach Hubby, make sure he understands your point of view and that he backs the decision 100% before he raises it with the ex.\n\nAll the best.", "Work out what you are wanting to put towards education in total for all three children. Then put a third or it towards the school. That way you're still contributing but with all kids receiving a fair amount from you. You have longer to save up for the other kids so it's fair overall.", "NAH. Your stepson is just one of three and it is reasonable to consider their equal treatment and what is and what is not affordable for your family. Of course, navigating the actual conversation about that is always a tricky part, but I don't think you're an asshole for this assessment of the situation", "NAH - This is a negotiation and you both have valid views.  However you would be unfair if you as a couple did not contribute towards his eldest childs education equally to the other children so unless you follow through on that and put money aside starting now I think you would be in the wrong.  Equally you'd be wrong if you found the money for your kids later to attend this school but didn't contribute to the oldest child's fees.   If you are going to argue for equal treatment then it should really be equal.", "NTA", "INFO\n\nWhy are you paying for his tuition?  He\u2019s not biologically yours!", "NTA - unless thr mother can come up with 100% of the fees. You have already had to find 6 or 7 YEARS worth of fees more than was originally agreed.

Instead of sharing finances, consider having a his, hers, and joint account for family bills. Stepson's tuition should be considered husband's responsibility, paid from husband's account. You have to do what's best for your kids as well.", "i think this is when separate finances is good, husband should not be off the hook for providing and education but OP also shouldn\u2019t have to pay for it", "My husband told her he didn't wish to keep paying the fees into highschool, and he was met with a \"I don't need you, I'll keep paying them\". So she has the means to pay on her own, however this scenario would feel a bit ick to me. I worry about her potentially spinning the narrative of being a downtrodden single mother who's ex won't pay school fees, even though that's not really the case.", "Would that include accounting of the money already spent? It sounds like they are many thousands into that investment.", "If she is willing and able to pay the fees, then there is nothing to discuss. You can't expect the boy's mother to not contribute as much as she wants to her sons education, just because having her pay more will make the father look bad.", "She can spin the narrative all she wants. If the truth is that his ex prefers private school for their son and can afford  it on her own, and that your husband treats that son equally to how he treats the children he has with you, there's no shame in it.", "How is that not the case? She is a single mother whose ex won\u2019t pay for their sons school fees anymore.", "it\u2019s the truth, y\u2019all have all these kids and can\u2019t provide so it\u2019s expected to be at the expense of your step son", "Yes you're exactly right, and if I were in her position I'd do the same if I could!", "It's technically true, but she would be lying by omission.  She unilaterally decided to spend her money on school fees despite having a free public option available.\n\nThat said, the ex hasn't said or done anything of that sort (at least as far as we know), so this is just a hypothetical and we can't consider the ex an AH for something she hasn't done.", "Well she isn't a single mother really, we share custody and all expenses down the middle. And it isn't that he 'won't' pay them, but that she changed the terms of the agreement and as such he 'can't' continue to pay them in a manner that is fair for all involved.", "Take the money! 1 out of 3 of your kids will get a good education leaving you with plenty of money to save for the other 2. If pride is your only reason for turning down the money and denying 1 kid a good education\u2026 that is piss poor.", "I honestly think it\u2019s a little projection.", "You mean fair for your biological children? Lady you are not fooling me. YTA", "Yes, exactly. Hence why I posted. It doesn't seem fair for the bulk of the financial contribution go to only one child's education. I am paying for this too, and there are 3 children to consider. It does not mean i love him any less. If he were my biological son and I couldn't afford to send the other two, my line of thinking would remain exactly the same.", "Well thankfully his mother has his future well in hand so everyone wins. You have more money for your children and he stays at his school.", "Yup you are the asshole. You want to take money from your step kid for the benefit of your bio kid. Thats what this comes down to. You dont like that your bio kids dont get the same thing. YTA.", "YTA\n\nBased on your comments, Ex has said she will pay 100% of the schools fees. She isnt asking you and your husband to cover 50% going forward. Your problem is that you & your husband can't afford to do the same for your children together, that isn't his exs problem or concern.\n\nLife isn't always fair and equal, especially within blended families where one parent is able to provide more for their child. That's just how it is. It would be grossly unfair to uproot a 9yr old from his school because its not fair, especially when your kids haven't started their education yet and won't do for a few more years.", "NTA. Ex has moved the goalposts twice now.", "The agreement was that he would stay there till primary school.

Pull out your money from the joint account to your own personal account.

Stepsons mom says she\u2019s going to pay 100% of fee and keep him in private. OP doesn\u2019t think _that_ is fair because she can\u2019t afford to send her kids?? YTA OP, if you try and stop your stepson from going when you wouldn\u2019t be paying any $$!!", "Because at the time I started I wasn't exercising foresight, and either way I still see him as my family and thought it would be a good thing to do.", "Except she has but op doesn't think that's fair on her family", "I'm actually not saying no at all - if she wants to pay 100% then of course she can, despite my feelings about it. I've made clear I would do the same in her position. I just worry about any potential resentment it might breed from my stepson towards his father.", "If she wants to spin that narrative, she will regardless of your husband is contributing or not. \nDon't make decisions on what she might do. Your NTA, your approach is fair and equitable for multiple children and your husband has stood with the original agreement.", "So then what's the issue? She offered to pay, why is this is Aita post and not a \"thank you so much\"?", "That\u2019s on your husband then. Not your problem.", "Yes, is the issue that your husband can\u2019t afford to pay half of the tuition for the two kids at once? Because while you\u2019re married, payment for your stepsons audition is technically his obligation not yours. Is separating out this expense problematic?", "You're the asshole. She's offering to pay. So basically you're denying your son a great opportunity that doesn't cost you anything, because your other sons won't get that same opportunity.\n\nFuck that. Don't hold one kid back to make it 'fair' for all three."]}
