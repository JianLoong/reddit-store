She is lovely, but kind of lives out of reality. For context: we don't live together and she lives with some wealthy relatives, never leaves home because she works as an independent and has a shit ton of clients. Obviously makes more than me, and it would look like everything she wants, she just gets it. Want a project?, she somehow gets it, more money?, gets a new client. It can be annoying because it feels like she tells me all about it like if she's rubbing it on my face.\n\nI have a job with low wages, and in the beginning she agreed that a gift was not mandatory for our anniversary or a birthday, she still plans something for my birthday. I have never asked her to do it, and she likes to take me to these expensive places I could never afford on my own, I can't do that back. We usually meet on Saturdays, she likes taking me out to eat something and chat, but lately I have had too much work and it has been around one month since I last saw her. Her birthday was three Saturdays ago, and I wished her a happy birthday but I don't have her time or her money, and she didn't seem bothered.\n\nThere is this client of hers though, who she has told me has already asked her out, and she has rejected (I know she's not interested in him, that doesn't worry me) but still sent her flowers and her favorite food on her birthday. I thought nothing of it, like, good luck man, she's not into flowers. Anyway, today I told her I would be working again and I will see her next week, and she exploded on me, full scale crying, telling me all about how I wasn't there for her birthday and didn't even take her out when even her client sent her something, I told her I thought that wasn't important?, I don't even like my birthday, and don't like celebrating, she screamed at me that it was not about me paying, she would have paid for us to go out on her birthday but I put my work over her, I told her that she needs to get her shit together and not everyone has a perfect life like she does, and I bust my ass working, so she should grow up and stop overreacting over a stupid birthday because she is not 5 anymore.\n\nLong story short she has blocked me on all social media, I was thinking of calling her at home and try to reason with her but first I want to make sure I am not the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1691284891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jcky2/aita_for_asking_my_gf_to_stop_overreacting_over/", "score": 159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like, on a scale of 0-10, you're putting in a 1. You don't just text your GF on a milestone birthday and that's it. You can buy cards at Dollar Tree for 2/$1 and stamps are under a buck. For less than $1.50, you could have at least mailed a card. \n\nWhat also troubles me is the way you talk about her. Is she supposed to dim her lights so she doesn't outshine you?? Grow up and be proud of her. \n\nExcept it's too late. She's moved on. You're not seeing her again.", "[deleted]", "YTA hahaha \u201cshe\u2019s not into flowers\u201d my man. Are you an amateur at dating? You fumbled the ball BIG TIME and a man who\u2019s willing to give her the time of day picked it up.", "YTA, even an in home movie date with her favourite snacks is better than nothing. It\u2019s the thought that counts not the money that\u2019s spent.", "You don't say a single favourable thing about her in this entire post. You made her birthday all about what you want and how you feel. You sound jealous and resentful of her success. You lashed out at her for wanting to spend time with you.\n\nAnd now you're asking reddit if you should ignore the very clear signals that she doesn't want to talk to you, not so you can apologise, but *checks notes* to convince her that she's wrong.\n\n\nYTA leave her alone so she can find someone who actually likes her.", "YTA- you might as well not even be dating her. Have seen her in a month and sent a TEXT for her birthday? \n\nYou could have easily sent her a card & her favorite candy/snacks. Would have been less than $10, hell you could\u2019ve made it less than $5! \n\nYou are putting zero effort into this relationship. I\u2019m honestly surprised she\u2019s stuck around that long", "YTA. Your girlfriend wants you to SEE her value. From what you\u2019ve written in this post, you seem to see her as a spoiled rich woman. She wanted you to make a big deal over her birthday or at least notice it in some way. It didn\u2019t have to be an expensive gift. I bet a poem or love letter would have made her happy. You have to eat anyway. Couldn\u2019t you fix food for a picnic? Make hotdogs and macaroni and cheese and serve it by candlelight? Go for a walk in the park? The list is endless. I dated men who didn\u2019t have a lot of money, and they all found ways to celebrate my birthday meaningfully. The gifts that cost the least are often the most special.\n\nWhy haven\u2019t you seen her in three weeks? Have you been working all that time? You didn\u2019t just miss her birthday, you didn\u2019t carve out time in three weeks to see her. It seems to me that you are taking the fact that you struggle financially out on her.", "YTA work can be stressful but you\u2019re not working 24 hours like you couldn\u2019t even call her? It\u2019s illegal to not have days off so you don\u2019t even have a day you could spend with her for her birthday? Even without money you can still make an effort and it sounds like you make no effort for her at all.

She deserves someone who at a minimum wants to spend time with her.", "YTA\n\nYou added in all this information about how she\u2019s rich and gets anything she wants, but that\u2019s all irrelevant. You both could be billionaires. You both could be struggling to make ends meet.\n\nWhat\u2019s happened here is that you aren\u2019t putting in effort. You don\u2019t have to do something extravagant to show someone you care about them. In fact, this guy didn\u2019t and I bet that gift meant a lot to her because he didn\u2019t have to and he still did. You are not looking great in comparison, even if she\u2019s not planning on leaving you for him or leaving you at all. \n\nYou should call her and tell her you fucked up. You should then try to make it up to her and tell her that you think you\u2019ve gotten complacent and want to start making changes.", "Of COURSE YTA. You seem pretty resentful of your girlfriend, are you sure you actually want to be with her? It's not hard to ask \"hey, gf, what would you like to do for your birthday?\" several weeks (or more) ahead of the day. Just because *you* don't care about your birthday doesn't mean *she* doesn't care about hers (especially if this was her 30th bday).

It's understandable that you have work commitments n couldn't celebrate on that exact day. however, birthdays are emotionally significant to people, n she absolutely has a right to have felt hurt. telling her to \"get her shit together\" n that she should \"grow up\" after neglecting her..is crazy ngl. she takes YOU out n does things for you because she loves you. you don\u2019t even have to do the most..you didn\u2019t even do something small with her to show that you cared??  just a TEXT??

Acknowledging a partners need is a basic tenet of a healthy relationship.", "Oof, YTA. Just read that back and tell me you don't see why. Hope you learned something for the next one, because she's gone.", "YTA\nTime and effort.  All your priorities seem to be work based  you need to find a balance.   \n\nyou sent her a happy birthday text come on ringing her would of meant so much more\n\nYour clearly not that into the relationship let her find someone that going to let her shine and get the treatment she deserves", "YTA. Six years, you see her 1x/week at the most and you made zero effort to do anything for her bday. Zero. Not even a card. Or an ice cream. You are the one who needs to grow up and realize that you treat people as if you care if you want to 'date' them.", "YTA. Sounds like you don\u2019t even like this girl at all to be honest. She seems like a keeper. \n\nHopefully someone else will take care of her now. Lol", "While I want to give you sympathy because I\u2019ve been in this situation I can\u2019t.\n\nFirst off to say she doesn\u2019t like flowers is complete bs she is probably just letting you down easy because she knows you don\u2019t have the means to send them. While she may seem fine with you not sending flowers she did refer to her \u201cclient\u201d (who I\u2019m certain she has feelings for) who sent her stuff on her birthday. The fact alone that she got gifts from someone other than you would bother tf out of me. And to be fair it\u2019s out of place for a client to do this but if he knows her birthday so well as much as her favorite food that\u2019s a red flag in its self. I\u2019m sure there has been some off the counter things you haven\u2019t noticed maybe due to work or intellect. Either way I\u2019m sure she was being unfair with this said client.\n\nSecond you put work before the one you supposedly would want to spend forever with. This might just be me but my father has really never been around as he is tending to his successful business and leaving me my sister and mom alone most nights. Work and relationships do not work well and the second you put work before family (or in this case your gf) they start falling out of love and begin to grow a hatred towards you. This is exactly what happened. You\u2019re telling me out of allllllll the days allowed there wasn\u2019t one day you could visit her even if it was for 30 minutes to explain that she means everything to you and that you will make it up to her one day.\n\nThird you are making excuses for her being better off than you. That and love have no significance to each other. If you truly love someone then anything else would come after them and it was clear to her and frankly the rest of us that working for a whole month and not finding a single day to spend time with her was more important. (I highly doubt you worked every single day for a whole month based on your lack to stick to love for 6 years) \n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong OP but this was a mistake on your end and you are the asshole. Love is not one sided you got too comfortable with her being lenient to your lack of showing love and this is why you are blocked on everything.", "Lol YTA you are not the main character in this world. Lol jerk", "YTA. It's not about the money (although clearly you're very hung up on that) it's the fact that you don't seem at all interested in putting effort into your relationship.

The only effort you put in to this \u201crelationship\u201d is putting her down, but you sure don\u2019t mind taking her money.  It sounds like she\u2019s better off with that client.

You're not married, not engaged, not living together, haven't even seen her in a month? You're not \"together,\" and from what you've told us, that's totally on you, not her.\n\nIf she were the one writing, I'd suggest she move on, but it looks like she's figured that out all on her own.

This is common, but unfortunately it\u2019s a lesson in women that you\u2019ve learned seemingly and unknowingly too late \ud83d\ude05 \u2026.

You can ask, \u201care you okay, babe?\u201d And her reply would be, \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d but with a stern and near dead expression.  99% of the time, they need time to think and assess and when they don\u2019t want to talk, they will give quick and short answers to questions.  Try to empathize with your female partner, even if she doesn\u2019t appear to be too upset or disappointed with you in the moment, don\u2019t assume it\u2019s not a big deal to her.

Repairing the damage done should\u2019ve been your next move.  Empathize, apologize, and make a sweet or nice gesture in the form of a gift or whatnot, depending on your income or skills, of course.

You've had weeks to act like you give a damn. It's not the working that's the problem, it's the lack of empathy and the superior attitude of only five year Olds care about birthdays that makes you the arsehole. You could have taken ten minutes  out of your day to write her something meaningful in a card and she probably would have been happy.", "YTA\n\nYou know that you can do nice things for people that don't require a lot of money? But what they do require is effort. And that appears to be something that  you're not willing to do for her.\n\nYou think you should reason with her? Reason what? She's justified. If she ever talks to you again, all you should do is apologize. Don't even ask her to take you back...you don't deserve her. Just say you've realized that you've been a complete jerk who took her for granted and you want to say how sorry you are for that. Do not ask her to forgive you. That would be just another thing you want her to do for you.\n\nShe's already done too much.", "YTA and I didn't even need to read past the first paragraph about her success.\nYou are a typical jealous male partner who CANNOT FATHOM a woman being successful (and more so) than you. So she SOMEHOW gets new projects, clients, money? Or - hear me out - does she maybe, you know, work for it? Maybe she's good at her job?\n\nYou are a super lazy partner who puts next to no effort in your relationship and jealous as well. And fyi no person (no matter the gender) in the entire world has ever taken well when told to \"stop overreacting\" Because thats a complete dismissal of someone's feelings.", "Has it sunk in yet that you no longer have a girlfriend?", "YTA. I understand your need to work for your income, but putting one day aside for her seems like the lowest effort thing you could have done, and you didn't even do that. What kind of relationship will you continue to have if you can't see her, it's been around a month (and now another week) that you've not seen her. That's not a relationship at all and I'm with her. I'd dump my boyfriend if he couldn't put some time aside for me.", "By the sounds of it, she would\u2019ve enjoyed it if you would have at least attempted to surprise her and send a card or do something meaningful. She\u2019s saying it doesn\u2019t have to be about money because it doesn\u2019t! Just do something nice, she pays for you all the time. Be a gentlemen on her birthday even though she\u2019s not expecting it. That\u2019s the best kind of birthday gift. something small saying \u201chey, I know I\u2019m working but I love and appreciate you. Happy Birthday. Even when someone says they don\u2019t care about birthday, deep down they kind of do.", "YATA, it would've been fine if you couldn't afford a gift but had spent time with her. Often time's the most important gift in a relationship. A couple of hours with her after your shift would've probably made her day. You might've been her only source of motivation and the reason for her to continue living and this surely would've broken her heart", "YTA, and she would do best if she kept you as an ex.", "You get out what you put in. YTA for being a low effort, high rent BF.", "YTA even if you were jobless and unemployed you should be spending time with your partner on their birthday. and if you really couldnt, you shouldnt be all high and mighty about it.", "YTA! Wow\u2026 I feel like you resent your gf for doing so well. Everyone has different expectations and wants out of a relationship. That said if you don\u2019t communicate than how will you know.", "Congrats you're single \ud83e\udd73", "God this makes my blood boil. Why would you date someone for SIX YEARS when you don\u2019t even like them and think the relationship is worth absolutely nothing. Disgusting", "YTA. There are many things that are cheap / not expensive at all that you can do for a birthday: a video, a letter, paper flowers. You have no excuse.", "YTA. You're telling me that in a month you couldn't arrange a single day at some point around her birthday to go out with her? Not a single day off? Not a single evening? Or morning? You wished her happy birthday. Great. I do that for my estranged family members. So I mean, kudos for min effort \n\nFYI my 16 yr olds boyfriend sent her a token gift through Amazon and asked her to open it on FaceTime for her bday. It was just a cheap ass plushie, that she freaking adores. You couldn't even do that? We're well off, she got hundreds of $$ in gifts, and her fave is that damn $10 plushie. A teenage boy got it, how can you, a grown man not.  \n\nWe make time and effort for what's important to us, and she clearly wasn't, and heard you loud and clear.\nShe was right to block you.", "You have a gf, but \"it's been A MONTH since I last saw her\". You are hilarious.", "YTA. I mean yeah it's ok if you couldn't make it to one important night because of work stuff, but you haven't even seen her for 3 weeks? Do you work 24 hours a day?", "YTA - it shouldn\u2019t be \u201ctry to reason with her\u201d it should be \u201cI\u2019m horrified I hurt her and I\u2019d like to listen to her to see what\u2019s up and what I can do about it\u201d", "YTA", "Don't bother calling her. You are clearly the AH here and she's finally seen the light.\n\nYour whole post sounds bitter and resentful of her life.", "This does not seem like a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship to me. You see each other rarely, & don\u2019t seem to communicate much. You now haven\u2019t seen her in a month & don\u2019t seem bothered by that. \n\nYou\u2019re obsessed with her privilege and \u201cperfect life\u201d, etc., but she certainly seems to be extremely low-maintenance. She doesn\u2019t expect much from you at all. But you have put absolutely no effort into this relationship, & she\u2019s not wrong for being upset. Acknowledging her birthday with a text and nothing else is pathetic. Pleading poverty is no excuse. There are lots of things you could\u2019ve done, including actually speaking to her or FaceTime or sending a card or watching a movie at home, bringing her favorite candy or a small gift or sticking a candle in a cupcake. Anything to acknowledge that it was her birthday, and more importantly that you care about her. It didn\u2019t even have to be exactly on her birthday & it didn\u2019t have to cost more than just a few dollars (or anything at all), but you couldn\u2019t be bothered. This is about so much more than just her birthday.\n\nIf she \u201chas a shit ton of clients\u201d, then she\u2019s clearly successful and a hard worker, not reclining on a golden sofa all day and ordering servants around.  But you\u2019d rather wallow in self-pity than actually acknowledge that and give her some credit. You should be proud of her, and you should have considered yourself fortunate that she kept her expectations so low.  I absolutely don\u2019t blame her for being done with you now. Most women would not have put up with your apathy for so long.\n\nYTA.\n\nEta: She has her shit together. You\u2019re the one who does not.", "YTA.. and a big one at that!", "So you take your GF for granted, constantly disparage her for daring to make more money than you, and make absolutely zero effort on things that are clearly important to her, and you\u2019re surprised she\u2019s cutting you loose?\n\nYTA and clueless to boot.", "YTA\nAre you sure you even want a relationship with this person, going almost a month without seeing your SA/girlfriend would be pretty tough for a lot of people, especially if she is getting flirted with by a client who as it seems from here is offering a lot more than her bf!\nIt's not about flowers it's about effort and your clearly not putting enough in. If it's someone's birthday and you care about them you go see them if you don't then you don't really care at all.", "YTA. You did nothing for her birthday. Nothing at all.\n\nBlocking you means she's your ex. Time to move on.", "YTA\n\nBut damn her friends and relatives are probably so damn excited to be rid of you", "YTA, she deserves better. Not finding one hour during whole month to see your girlfriend is unbelievable. You did not need to take her out to a restaurant and give an expensive gift for her birthday, you could have cooked at home and showed her some care and love. She realized you don\u2019t care about her and did the right thing by blocking you.", "YTA. Haven\u2019t seen her in a month? Couldn\u2019t even call her or plan a free date for her 30th? She needs to find someone better.", "YTA\u2014 I hope she find someone who understands her love language.", "YTA\u2014Leave her alone and let her move on, you\u2019re unequally yoked and have an inferiority complex.", "Her birthday was a month ago and you haven\u2019t even seen her? My god. YTA. \n\nShe will definitely find someone who deserves her more.", "You sound extremely jealous and resentful. Not being able to spend her birthday with her because of work is okay. What's not okay is how you shrug it off as something lame because YOU'RE not interested in celebrating birthdays. You can't see why this is important to her.  And the excuse for your nonchalance is that she's more successful than you? Grow up. YTA", "Yes, YTA. You were so envious of her that you treated her like shit. You didn't even bother with common courtesy, not to talk about showing a behavior you would expect to show towards a loved one.\n\nYou probably need a girl who is totally broke without anything good in her life, just to feel adequate yourself. Which makes you a loser on top of beeing TA.", "I would also be very upset if I were her. I understand things outside of people's control come up all the time in this Capitalist hell scape. Even on Birthdays. But I do expect my partner to go out of his way to put in effort at times like this and I'd do the same. Wether that's driving over after work at midnight just to give me a gas station cup cake. Or writing me a poem and making paper flowers. Anything really. But you didn't prioritize her for weeks. That's a lot in a committed relationship even surrounding normal occasions. \nIt's sounds like you may be penalizing her for her success. If she's not the one comparing or expecting more of you then it doesn't sound like she's trying to rub things in your face. Unfortunately it sounds like the two of you may not be on equal ground in your life at the moment. Hopefully you find a happy conclusion even if it's not together.", "Yta. Bruh it's not even about her birthday. You haven't seen her in a month. She's upset someone is trying to pursue and is taking interest in her and she's turning them down because she's committed to someone who's not even interested in seeing her.\n\nYou've been together 6 years and you're only seeing each other on Saturday? Normal couples don't do that let alone neglecting to see each other for a whole month because they're \"busy\". You do not work 24/7 you could have at least make time to see her for a couple of hours in the evening. Also you knew her birthday was coming and you haven't spent time with her, plan some PTO.\n\nAnd don't make this about money. Cook dinner at home, watch a movie, go to the park like it's not hard. I can't believe you said she was overreacting like a 5 year old when you haven't seen her in a MONTH", "YTA\n\nI had a similar thought once I got married. We don\u2019t need to celebrate my birthday, and so she should not care about hers either. Until you realize- it\u2019s not about the birthday at all. Caring about the things she cares about is relationship 101. Honestly, probably an overreaction on her part  about the actual birthday thing from outside looking in, but once again- not about the birthday. She just wants to know you care.\n\nOur anniversary is today and I spent literally $20 on two bags of her favorite candy. She loves it. It\u2019s the little things homie", "YTA - god, she deserves better.\n\nShe didn't explode over 1 birthday, she exploded over the 6 years of little things thag piled up and up until the last straw that broke the camels back.\n\nI can't see anywhere that you care for her in the slightest. A card, a teddy/flower, it doesn't cost much, heck just write her a love letter. But you immediately find excuses for yourself, tall her down and honestly it's sad that a random client seems to know her better than her adult partner of *six years*. \n\n>and try to reason with her\n\nYou hopefully mean \"genuinely apologize and change\", if not - probably for the best to leave her alone, wouldn't surprise me if she already moved on. She had enough time to see you don't care or have even one nice thing to say about her.", "YTA. Give her the best birthday present and leave her the fuck alone.", "I hope she doesn\u2019t answer your phone call lol", "You've been together 6 YEARS but only see each other once a week at most and haven't seen her in a month? Dude, you're at best friends with benefits and it sounds like she's getting NO benefits. YTA, you couldn't even put in the bare minimum of effort and acknowledge her birthday. I get that you don't have much money for a gift but damn it dude, a card and her favourite snacks would've worked if you couldn't visit. Just because birthdays aren't important to you doesn't mean they're not important to her. My ex HATED his birthday, he didn't like the feeling of aging, I love my birthdays, I like feeling a little special. Even though he hated birthdays my ex always tried to make me feel a little special for mine and get me a nice present. Nothing super pricey, just something sweet and thoughtful", "You don't even seem to like her, OP, so it's probably best to call it quits.", "YTA.\n\nAnd also r/amitheex", "YTA- Congratulations, hope you improve on your next relationship.", "YTA\n\nAnd don\u2019t blame it on your shit financial situation. \n\nShe lost it on you after you canceled yet another date with her. You basically ghosted her on her 30 birthday. She wasn\u2019t complaining, even tho she had every right to. The fact you don\u2019t like your birthday doesn\u2019t mean we are all on the same note with you. Then you didn\u2019t find time to see her for another several weeks. She lost it on you after several weeks. She was patient with you for several week of your asshole behavior. \n\nAnd after that, you had the audacity to tell her, to get her shit together?\n\nHer wanting love and affection on her birthday (or some time around it) isn\u2019t her being a rich brad. It\u2019s her being a human. You on the other hand are shitty boyfriend and you refuse to take responsibility for it because you are poor?", "So you haven't seen her in a month. \nShe has an important job, but makes time for you. \nYour job is SO low paying that you can't even afford a little present or card, but still you can't make time for her ON her birthday, on the week after, or the week after that or the week after that. \nWhy exactly are you upset that she blocked you? \nIt's not like you like her or have any desire to spend time with her? \nYTA", "YTA.\n\nYou might not be compatible; look I get that Birthday are not public holidays and you \"have\" to work whatever.\n\nBut here the thing, I'm not rich nor do I have rich parents, but I have never once worked on my birthday.\n\nWhether it's rostering off or calling in sick I don't work on my birthday, life outside of work always comes first.\n\nWhat ultimately changed this from N A H into YTA in my books is you outbust at the end.\n\n>, I told her I thought that wasn't important?\n\nWhat's important is effort, someone she not interested in made an effort, you also need to make an effort.\n\n>I don't even like my birthday, and don't like celebrating\n\nHer birthday isn't about you; you can do noting and not care about your birthday all you like but, in a relationship, you treat your SO's birthday how they want.\n\nthis mean you might not be compatible, she wants to celebrate birthdays, YTA for refusing to celebrate hers at all.\n\n>Long story short she has blocked me on all social media, I was thinking of calling her at home and try to reason with her but first I want to make sure I am not the asshole here?\n\nHonestly for the best, she can do better with someone that is more compatible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story short, you are the one that needs to grow up.", "YTA. She may be privileged but even so you sound bitter and jealous. Being together that long, it\u2019s complete shit of you to skip out on her birthday and expect a text would be enough. Good thing blocked you, hopefully she goes back and takes up the nice client on the date since even as just an acquaintance he\u2019s more thoughtful than you.", "Worse, he tried to portray her as a pampered princess, who gets everything she wants without any efforts. Meanwhile she is a hardworking and successfull specialist, who is so good at her job that she doesn't has to fight for clients, they fight for her...\n\nYTA, of course", "Right? I was thinking all along, does he even like his gf?", "Well he does say one favorable thing about her. She has the money to go all out for him \ud83d\ude44", "And they only see each other once a week? For *six years*?!?", "Right?! But it's the fact that OP just cant get over how much she makes and how he feels like she's rubbing her success in his face. He's got serious problems.", "I light the metaphor about dimming her lights.\n\nMy wife is smarter and has her life better put together than me. I love it, she makes me try to be on her level.\n\nOnly weak men wanting to appear strong seek out a weak partner.", "So true, I find it so hard to believe OP couldn't take one or 2 days off ahead of time to spend time with her on her birthday, but I almost think he probably didn't even realize it was her birthday until he saw a notification on Facebook or something ridiculous so he couldn't plan ahead so instead shoots her a quick text and then tell her he will see her in a month \ud83d\ude44", "YTA. I hope she ends up with the guy who sent her flowers and her favorite food", "Okay, this!! I legit think the gifts are really just a bonus for her. Its obvious she wants time and love, and to feel like shes important.\n\nAnd her 30th??? Oy vey. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "For real. My boyfriend brought me surprise flowers on his walk home from the gym today \u2026 just because he thought of me and loves me", "Yup. Zero effort was put in here. \n\nYou can buy a candle from the dollar store and make cheese omelettes for dinner. A homemade meal by candlelight is a lovely way to celebrate a birthday, and that costs almost nothing.", "Right! She talks about her work and he sees it as \u2018rubbing it in\u2019 his face. Sounds like he\u2019s also resentful that she seems to enjoy her work, not just that she makes more money.", "I read this thinking a 15 year old wrote it. I still don\u2019t believe it\u2019s real.", "She has money she spends on him which *checks notes* really annoys him?", "Yup I noticed that too, OP is a gold digger", "Lol this! I saw that too!! Once a week for six years!!

Well he don\u2019t even have one now. Hope she stays smart and stays far away from him.", "YTA - So a gf you\u2019ve been with for six years only justifies a happy birthday text on her 30th birthday during a month of not seeing her? She\u2019s rightly judging you based on your actions. Your actions are those of someone who doesn\u2019t care for her or her happiness. \n\nWhy do you even want to get back together with her?", "Did you not even bother to send her a card or phone her? \n\n\nWtf is wrong with you", "So, you didn't actually do anything for her birthday, a text is nothing, it earns you no points at all.", "This! He doesn't like his own birthday so expects her to just not want to celebrate her own and then insults her calling her a 5 year old and to get over it because she wants to celebrate a milestone birthday of turning 30? But of course during his birthday that he \"doesn't like\" he accepts all the gifts and dinners she pays for but he cant even do something simple like buy the poor girl a damn card, or hell just draw a card himself or just do anything at all for her besides a shitty text? I hope this girl moves on and gives her client a chance because he sounds way better than her boyfriend of 6 years"]}
