She is lovely, but kind of lives out of reality. For context: we don't live together and she lives with some wealthy relatives, never leaves home because she works as an independent and has a shit ton of clients. Obviously makes more than me, and it would look like everything she wants, she just gets it. Want a project?, she somehow gets it, more money?, gets a new client. It can be annoying because it feels like she tells me all about it like if she's rubbing it on my face.\n\nI have a job with low wages, and in the beginning she agreed that a gift was not mandatory for our anniversary or a birthday, she still plans something for my birthday. I have never asked her to do it, and she likes to take me to these expensive places I could never afford on my own, I can't do that back. We usually meet on Saturdays, she likes taking me out to eat something and chat, but lately I have had too much work and it has been around one month since I last saw her. Her birthday was three Saturdays ago, and I wished her a happy birthday but I don't have her time or her money, and she didn't seem bothered.\n\nThere is this client of hers though, who she has told me has already asked her out, and she has rejected (I know she's not interested in him, that doesn't worry me) but still sent her flowers and her favorite food on her birthday. I thought nothing of it, like, good luck man, she's not into flowers. Anyway, today I told her I would be working again and I will see her next week, and she exploded on me, full scale crying, telling me all about how I wasn't there for her birthday and didn't even take her out when even her client sent her something, I told her I thought that wasn't important?, I don't even like my birthday, and don't like celebrating, she screamed at me that it was not about me paying, she would have paid for us to go out on her birthday but I put my work over her, I told her that she needs to get her shit together and not everyone has a perfect life like she does, and I bust my ass working, so she should grow up and stop overreacting over a stupid birthday because she is not 5 anymore.\n\nLong story short she has blocked me on all social media, I was thinking of calling her at home and try to reason with her but first I want to make sure I am not the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1691284891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jcky2/aita_for_asking_my_gf_to_stop_overreacting_over/", "score": 293, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like, on a scale of 0-10, you're putting in a 1. You don't just text your GF on a milestone birthday and that's it. You can buy cards at Dollar Tree for 2/$1 and stamps are under a buck. For less than $1.50, you could have at least mailed a card. \n\nWhat also troubles me is the way you talk about her. Is she supposed to dim her lights so she doesn't outshine you?? Grow up and be proud of her. \n\nExcept it's too late. She's moved on. You're not seeing her again.", "[deleted]", "YTA hahaha \u201cshe\u2019s not into flowers\u201d my man. Are you an amateur at dating? You fumbled the ball BIG TIME and a man who\u2019s willing to give her the time of day picked it up.", "YTA, even an in home movie date with her favourite snacks is better than nothing. It\u2019s the thought that counts not the money that\u2019s spent.", "You don't say a single favourable thing about her in this entire post. You made her birthday all about what you want and how you feel. You sound jealous and resentful of her success. You lashed out at her for wanting to spend time with you.\n\nAnd now you're asking reddit if you should ignore the very clear signals that she doesn't want to talk to you, not so you can apologise, but *checks notes* to convince her that she's wrong.\n\n\nYTA leave her alone so she can find someone who actually likes her.", "YTA- you might as well not even be dating her. Have seen her in a month and sent a TEXT for her birthday? \n\nYou could have easily sent her a card & her favorite candy/snacks. Would have been less than $10, hell you could\u2019ve made it less than $5! \n\nYou are putting zero effort into this relationship. I\u2019m honestly surprised she\u2019s stuck around that long", "YTA. Your girlfriend wants you to SEE her value. From what you\u2019ve written in this post, you seem to see her as a spoiled rich woman. She wanted you to make a big deal over her birthday or at least notice it in some way. It didn\u2019t have to be an expensive gift. I bet a poem or love letter would have made her happy. You have to eat anyway. Couldn\u2019t you fix food for a picnic? Make hotdogs and macaroni and cheese and serve it by candlelight? Go for a walk in the park? The list is endless. I dated men who didn\u2019t have a lot of money, and they all found ways to celebrate my birthday meaningfully. The gifts that cost the least are often the most special.\n\nWhy haven\u2019t you seen her in three weeks? Have you been working all that time? You didn\u2019t just miss her birthday, you didn\u2019t carve out time in three weeks to see her. It seems to me that you are taking the fact that you struggle financially out on her.", "YTA work can be stressful but you\u2019re not working 24 hours like you couldn\u2019t even call her? It\u2019s illegal to not have days off so you don\u2019t even have a day you could spend with her for her birthday? Even without money you can still make an effort and it sounds like you make no effort for her at all.

She deserves someone who at a minimum wants to spend time with her.", "YTA\n\nYou added in all this information about how she\u2019s rich and gets anything she wants, but that\u2019s all irrelevant. You both could be billionaires. You both could be struggling to make ends meet.\n\nWhat\u2019s happened here is that you aren\u2019t putting in effort. You don\u2019t have to do something extravagant to show someone you care about them. In fact, this guy didn\u2019t and I bet that gift meant a lot to her because he didn\u2019t have to and he still did. You are not looking great in comparison, even if she\u2019s not planning on leaving you for him or leaving you at all. \n\nYou should call her and tell her you fucked up. You should then try to make it up to her and tell her that you think you\u2019ve gotten complacent and want to start making changes.", "Of COURSE YTA. You seem pretty resentful of your girlfriend, are you sure you actually want to be with her? It's not hard to ask \"hey, gf, what would you like to do for your birthday?\" several weeks (or more) ahead of the day. Just because *you* don't care about your birthday doesn't mean *she* doesn't care about hers (especially if this was her 30th bday).

It's understandable that you have work commitments n couldn't celebrate on that exact day. however, birthdays are emotionally significant to people, n she absolutely has a right to have felt hurt. telling her to \"get her shit together\" n that she should \"grow up\" after neglecting her..is crazy ngl. she takes YOU out n does things for you because she loves you. you don\u2019t even have to do the most..you didn\u2019t even do something small with her to show that you cared??  just a TEXT??

Acknowledging a partners need is a basic tenet of a healthy relationship.", "Oof, YTA. Just read that back and tell me you don't see why. Hope you learned something for the next one, because she's gone.", "YTA\nTime and effort.  All your priorities seem to be work based  you need to find a balance.   \n\nyou sent her a happy birthday text come on ringing her would of meant so much more\n\nYour clearly not that into the relationship let her find someone that going to let her shine and get the treatment she deserves", "YTA. Six years, you see her 1x/week at the most and you made zero effort to do anything for her bday. Zero. Not even a card. Or an ice cream. You are the one who needs to grow up and realize that you treat people as if you care if you want to 'date' them.", "YTA. Sounds like you don\u2019t even like this girl at all to be honest. She seems like a keeper. \n\nHopefully someone else will take care of her now. Lol", "While I want to give you sympathy because I\u2019ve been in this situation I can\u2019t.\n\nFirst off to say she doesn\u2019t like flowers is complete bs she is probably just letting you down easy because she knows you don\u2019t have the means to send them. While she may seem fine with you not sending flowers she did refer to her \u201cclient\u201d (who I\u2019m certain she has feelings for) who sent her stuff on her birthday. The fact alone that she got gifts from someone other than you would bother tf out of me. And to be fair it\u2019s out of place for a client to do this but if he knows her birthday so well as much as her favorite food that\u2019s a red flag in its self. I\u2019m sure there has been some off the counter things you haven\u2019t noticed maybe due to work or intellect. Either way I\u2019m sure she was being unfair with this said client.\n\nSecond you put work before the one you supposedly would want to spend forever with. This might just be me but my father has really never been around as he is tending to his successful business and leaving me my sister and mom alone most nights. Work and relationships do not work well and the second you put work before family (or in this case your gf) they start falling out of love and begin to grow a hatred towards you. This is exactly what happened. You\u2019re telling me out of allllllll the days allowed there wasn\u2019t one day you could visit her even if it was for 30 minutes to explain that she means everything to you and that you will make it up to her one day.\n\nThird you are making excuses for her being better off than you. That and love have no significance to each other. If you truly love someone then anything else would come after them and it was clear to her and frankly the rest of us that working for a whole month and not finding a single day to spend time with her was more important. (I highly doubt you worked every single day for a whole month based on your lack to stick to love for 6 years) \n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong OP but this was a mistake on your end and you are the asshole. Love is not one sided you got too comfortable with her being lenient to your lack of showing love and this is why you are blocked on everything.", "Lol YTA you are not the main character in this world. Lol jerk", "YTA. It's not about the money (although clearly you're very hung up on that) it's the fact that you don't seem at all interested in putting effort into your relationship.

The only effort you put in to this \u201crelationship\u201d is putting her down, but you sure don\u2019t mind taking her money.  It sounds like she\u2019s better off with that client.

You're not married, not engaged, not living together, haven't even seen her in a month? You're not \"together,\" and from what you've told us, that's totally on you, not her.\n\nIf she were the one writing, I'd suggest she move on, but it looks like she's figured that out all on her own.

You're actually the one who needs to grow the f* ck up more. \n\nHonestly, most men really fail women when it comes to celebrating milestone/yearly important events and congratulations you are now a member of those incompetent men.\n\nI'm glad your ex ( and yes ) she's your ex now that she doesn't need to belittle herself in order to grow your poor little manly ego.

This is common, but unfortunately it\u2019s a lesson in women that you\u2019ve learned seemingly and unknowingly too late \ud83d\ude05 \u2026.

You can ask, \u201care you okay, babe?\u201d And her reply would be, \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d but with a stern and near dead expression.  99% of the time, they need time to think and assess and when they don\u2019t want to talk, they will give quick and short answers to questions.  Try to empathize with your female partner, even if she doesn\u2019t appear to be too upset or disappointed with you in the moment, don\u2019t assume it\u2019s not a big deal to her.

Repairing the damage done should\u2019ve been your next move.  Empathize, apologize, and make a sweet or nice gesture in the form of a gift or whatnot, depending on your income or skills, of course.

You think because you disdain birthday celebrations that your approach should apply to all birthdays; that it is the rational/ logical/ appropriate/ \"adult\" approach, and that her approach is the irrational/ emotional/ inapproriate/ \"childish\" approach. \n\nYou are wrong.\n\nI have known many people who feel \"set\" holidays are just corporate money grabs that have no value in celebrating. They say things like, \"If you really love someone, you show them every day, instead of just buying them a gift on some corporate holiday.\"\n\nThe thing I have noticed is that they don't. They don't show it every day. They don't buy or make little cards with poems in them. They don't send flowers. They don't take time to call and say hello on break. They don't check in on their friends just because. They don't do all the little things without needing reminders. \n\nThose milestone days -- birthdays, holidays, anniversaries -- they serve as a moment to pause and really look at the people who we value in our lives. To say, \"Look at you! You've been on this earth for this many years, and that's a thing I'd like to celebrate. Man, aren't I lucky to know you!\" Or to say, \"Wow! It's our anniversary again already? I cannot believe we've been together this many years. It feels like just a breath. I am so lucky to have this time with you.\"\n\nThese holidays have the meaning one assigns to them, but to me, they've always been about celebrating the beauty of people and my relationships with them. Choosing not to even acknowledge the birthday of someone I love feels like sending a signal that I no longer value them or care about their well-being or happiness. It's not about the material stuff; it's about valuing the individual.\n\nI get that you do not value these holidays. I've known **tons** of people like you, who completely disdain these types of things -- and when it's your birthday, it's completely valid of you to request for your friends and SO to ignore your day (this is a **very** hard request for someone like me to honor, because, as I said, I genuinely see these days as taking a moment out to recognize the fact that I am friends with someone amazing -- but I also believe in honoring my friend's wishes, and if their stated wish is to be completely ignored on their birthday, I'll unhappily ignore them), but it is not okay for you to make the transitive assumption that because **you** think it's stupid, it is okay for **you** to project **your** values on everyone you date and are friends with.

Man, she's just asking to spend time with her bf for a birthday, she isn't asking for a diamond ring or a brand new car... \n\nAnyways, perhaps she has seen the light and moved on, which is all I wish for her. As for you, you have some work to do with your insecurities before they ruin another relationship. Or perhaps date a poorer girl, this way your fragile masculinity won't be threatened again lol", "YTA, you ignored her birthday like a chump.\n\nSomeone else is going to win her heart by showing her kindness and love, and then there's you, angry she is expecting a card.", "Damn you are a loser. Plain and simple", "This is so fucking sad.. YTA", "all I will say \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "YTA- Its not just the flowers you turd. Its the thought and care put into it. I wouldnt be shocked if they dated. Would be better for her.", "NTA. What is she going to do move you in and pay for you to live so you can work whatever schedule she demands.", "This entire post comes across as you being insecure, money-focused, envious of your girlfriend's success, shallow, bitter and uncaring. You don't bother to acknowledge her THIRTIETH birthday in any way except a text message (when there a multitude of free or low cost ways to make sometime feel special). You didn't even see her for a fucking month. I feel so bad for this poor woman. All she wanted from you was your affection and attention and you couldn't even provide that - presumably because you believe you need to earn more money to be able to give her any care (because caring about someone and giving them your love, time and attention is soooo expensive! /s). \n\nShe's already left you. You deserve that. If you try to contact her to explain to her why she is \"wrong\", you'll only underscore to her why she is in fact right to walk away - something that, trust me, she already knows. \n\nYTA btw. In case that wasn't clear.", "You're absolutely the asshole.", "YTA hopefully she will stay ex forever as you do not deserve her. You\u2019re terrible boyfriend, no effort whatsoever. What do you bring to that relationship? She may as well be single.", "YTA, it doesn't seem like you are interested in making this relationship nor willing to do any effort.\n\nI don't care about celebrating birthdays nor do i know how to bake, yet for my wife's birthday, i looked up a recipe and baked gluten free cake and prepared some presents and sang for her.\n\nNone of it i care about for myself, but i did it cause i know she loves these things and in any social or romantic relationship sometimes you do things purely for the sake of others cause you love and care about them and to see them happy makes it worth the effort \n\nThere are a lot of things meant for children that we still enjoy as adults, should we all stop enjoying them cause we are not 5 anymore?!!", "YTA. Please do not try to get in touch with her, she deserves sooo much better than you. I hope she finds someone who is not afraid of and bitter about her success, who tries to make time for her, cares about and appreciates her.", "YTA. Being jealous of your girlfriend is why you are trying to disregard a day that is specifically important for her.", "YTA\nAnd you spelled ex girlfriend wrong.", "YTA. Relationships require effort. While you are making this all about money she just wants your time. And you can\u2019t even seem to give her that.", "Being in a relationship means keep three points of view happy: yours, hers, and the one you share. It seems to me that she\u2019s been patient and understanding about you having work obligations, but you haven\u2019t been very understanding of her attachment to celebrating a birthday, which means (in the shared POV) you could\u2019ve made time to celebrate with her on \u2018any other day\u2019 since her actual birthday - but you didn\u2019t. And the flowers aren\u2019t the thing, it\u2019s the thinking about someone sufficiently to make a \u2018thinking about you\u2019 gesture. \n\nI get the money thing is annoying, but what you have to realise is everyone who works for a living envies someone who works smarter (same effort or less) for more reward. This only works out favourably, if you step up; don\u2019t be expecting someone to step down for you, without a good deal more effort on gestures of affection. Your post reads like a begrudging teenager, not a thirty year old adult.", "Have you ever put any effort into this relationship? Because it sounds like you haven't. \n\nYTA", "You haven\u2019t even made time to see her in a month. YTA", "YTA big time. No woman is not into flowers. Second you should be proud of your girlfriend and support her in any way possibile. If I were you I'd ditch my job to take care of her like switch classic gender roles. Minimum wage job is not even worth it in terms of learning or getting experience.", "YTA\n\nYou're lazy, and resentful.\n\nDo you even like her? You're so dismissive.\n\nI can guarantee you she doesn't magically wish for a new client and they suddenly appear in front of her. She's obviously been working hard, as well as networking. She's clearly got a good reputation in her field, and you're just handwaving it like its no biggie.\n\nAnd a birthday *text*! Are you 16? You couldn't spare 20 minutes to pick up the phone? \n\nAre you married to Saturday's? Why can't you see her on a Sunday? I can't believe you let it go for an entire month.", "YTA. How the hell she stayed with you all for 6 year sis beyond me. You sound very selfish., Resentful, and honestly like you were just using her for nice things every so often. Flowers can be $5 you cheap fuck.", " NTA do you really see a future with that spoiled child?", "YTA. You resent her and it\u2019s really sad. I hope she finds someone who isn\u2019t sad and bitter", "How has this relationship continued for SIX YEARS, and what is OP bringing to it, exactly?", "Yta, and that's not your gf anymore, bud", "100% the AH....  \nYou sound very jealous of her lifestyle which is a red flag anyway, but to do absolutely nothing for your gf, even on her birthday, and excuse it for 'work' is such as AH move.  \nYou could have sent her something, no matter how small; it is not all about money, but it seems to you that money is everything. I honestly hope she never comes back to you, she deserves love and someone who wants to give her attention.", "YTA", "Right? A card and a cake he made from a mix would\u2019ve been under ten bucks.", "this last part of this comment was so corny lmao.", "Wait a second, are you the GF? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "This reads like two teenagers in an awkward, first-time LDR, not two adults in their 30s.", "I mean...maybe she genuinely isn't into flowers. \n\nBut that said, you're still right because getting flowers given to her at least is a visible sign that someone thought of her. And that's nice even if someone misjudged your taste.\n\nUnlike OP. Who could have made all sorts of thoughtful but low-cost/free gestures, but apparently decided that if he couldn't afford big gestures, he wouldn't bother with anything.", "I\u2019m sorry is that how work works? lol", "SHE\u2019S not worth HIS time? \ud83d\ude02", "She doesn\u2019t have a perfect life. She has this asshole for a boyfriend..", "100% THIS", "My wife is genuinely not into flowers. So I get her her favorite socks. Or her favorite whiskey or beer. Or snack. As an \u201cI\u2019m thinking about you\u201d to \u201ccongrats on your promotion\u201d gift. Something to show I care about her. It\u2019s not the flowers; it\u2019s the intention behind the gift. ETA I have given her flowers occasionally and she has still appreciated the thought behind them (and the whiskey next to them even more).", "And this is the key thing here: he simply couldn't be bothered. Because envy, inferiority, etc all made him go virtually NC with his own girlfriend, even on her milestone birthday. This man needs to grow tf up and realise that there are many, many more things than money that matter in this world.", "Or like an hour at night to go out to dinner. Especially since she said she'd pay...", "Even if you couldn't take her out on that day because of work. HOW does it not cross your mind to just plan something on a different day? She said she'd have no issue paying as long as you spent time together, and there are plenty of dates that cost next to nothing, like a picnic or a nice walk in a park. You sound like you don't care at all about spending time with her, it's not about money or your job.", "Damn bro, yeh you completely fucked up, throughout the whole relationship and she is far better off without you. Fuck is wrong with you?", "My man she is your ex and good riddance of you. I hope she has a happier life with someone who deserves her", "Amazing. The fact that you didn\u2019t forget actually makes your behaviour even even worse - yet here you are telling everyone about it. \n\nYTA. \n\nYou\u2019re also (probably) the ex now too.", "Right, I think literally anything would've been better than one happy birthday text message... dude just doesn't care which is really sad for that poor girl", "I think it might have been a wake up call for *her*. \n\nI should have been a wake up call for him, too, but he's been too comfortable taking her for granted and feeling bitter that her hard work has paid off for her.\n\nIt's not in him to try hard."]}
