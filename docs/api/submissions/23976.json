She is lovely, but kind of lives out of reality. For context: we don't live together and she lives with some wealthy relatives, never leaves home because she works as an independent and has a shit ton of clients. Obviously makes more than me, and it would look like everything she wants, she just gets it. Want a project?, she somehow gets it, more money?, gets a new client. It can be annoying because it feels like she tells me all about it like if she's rubbing it on my face.\n\nI have a job with low wages, and in the beginning she agreed that a gift was not mandatory for our anniversary or a birthday, she still plans something for my birthday. I have never asked her to do it, and she likes to take me to these expensive places I could never afford on my own, I can't do that back. We usually meet on Saturdays, she likes taking me out to eat something and chat, but lately I have had too much work and it has been around one month since I last saw her. Her birthday was three Saturdays ago, and I wished her a happy birthday but I don't have her time or her money, and she didn't seem bothered.\n\nThere is this client of hers though, who she has told me has already asked her out, and she has rejected (I know she's not interested in him, that doesn't worry me) but still sent her flowers and her favorite food on her birthday. I thought nothing of it, like, good luck man, she's not into flowers. Anyway, today I told her I would be working again and I will see her next week, and she exploded on me, full scale crying, telling me all about how I wasn't there for her birthday and didn't even take her out when even her client sent her something, I told her I thought that wasn't important?, I don't even like my birthday, and don't like celebrating, she screamed at me that it was not about me paying, she would have paid for us to go out on her birthday but I put my work over her, I told her that she needs to get her shit together and not everyone has a perfect life like she does, and I bust my ass working, so she should grow up and stop overreacting over a stupid birthday because she is not 5 anymore.\n\nLong story short she has blocked me on all social media, I was thinking of calling her at home and try to reason with her but first I want to make sure I am not the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1691284891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jcky2/aita_for_asking_my_gf_to_stop_overreacting_over/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For less than $1.50, you could have at least mailed a card. \n\nWhat also troubles me is the way you talk about her. Is she supposed to dim her lights so she doesn't outshine you?? Grow up and be proud of her. \n\nExcept it's too late. She's moved on. You're not seeing her again.", "YTA It's not about the money. You put zero effort into this relationship. You're blocked because she realizes she deserves better and you are dismissed.", "YTA hahaha \u201cshe\u2019s not into flowers\u201d my man. Are you an amateur at dating? You fumbled the ball BIG TIME and a man who\u2019s willing to give her the time of day picked it up.", "YTA, even an in home movie date with her favourite snacks is better than nothing. It\u2019s the thought that counts not the money that\u2019s spent.", "You don't say a single favourable thing about her in this entire post. You made her birthday all about what you want and how you feel. You sound jealous and resentful of her success. You lashed out at her for wanting to spend time with you.\n\nAnd now you're asking reddit if you should ignore the very clear signals that she doesn't want to talk to you, not so you can apologise, but *checks notes* to convince her that she's wrong.\n\n\nYTA leave her alone so she can find someone who actually likes her.", "YTA- you might as well not even be dating her. Have seen her in a month and sent a TEXT for her birthday? \n\nYou could have easily sent her a card & her favorite candy/snacks.

I\u2019m honestly surprised she\u2019s stuck around that long", "YTA. Your girlfriend wants you to SEE her value. From what you\u2019ve written in this post, you seem to see her as a spoiled rich woman. She wanted you to make a big deal over her birthday or at least notice it in some way. It didn\u2019t have to be an expensive gift. I bet a poem or love letter would have made her happy. You have to eat anyway. Couldn\u2019t you fix food for a picnic? Make hotdogs and macaroni and cheese and serve it by candlelight? Go for a walk in the park? The list is endless. I dated men who didn\u2019t have a lot of money, and they all found ways to celebrate my birthday meaningfully. The gifts that cost the least are often the most special.\n\nWhy haven\u2019t you seen her in three weeks? Have you been working all that time? You didn\u2019t just miss her birthday, you didn\u2019t carve out time in three weeks to see her. It seems to me that you are taking the fact that you struggle financially out on her.", "YTA work can be stressful but you\u2019re not working 24 hours like you couldn\u2019t even call her? It\u2019s illegal to not have days off so you don\u2019t even have a day you could spend with her for her birthday? Even without money you can still make an effort and it sounds like you make no effort for her at all.

You both could be billionaires. You both could be struggling to make ends meet.\n\nWhat\u2019s happened here is that you aren\u2019t putting in effort. You don\u2019t have to do something extravagant to show someone you care about them. In fact, this guy didn\u2019t and I bet that gift meant a lot to her because he didn\u2019t have to and he still did. You are not looking great in comparison, even if she\u2019s not planning on leaving you for him or leaving you at all. \n\nYou should call her and tell her you fucked up. You should then try to make it up to her and tell her that you think you\u2019ve gotten complacent and want to start making changes.", "Of COURSE YTA. You seem pretty resentful of your girlfriend, are you sure you actually want to be with her? It's not hard to ask \"hey, gf, what would you like to do for your birthday?\" several weeks (or more) ahead of the day. Just because *you* don't care about your birthday doesn't mean *she* doesn't care about hers (especially if this was her 30th bday).

It's understandable that you have work commitments n couldn't celebrate on that exact day. however, birthdays are emotionally significant to people, n she absolutely has a right to have felt hurt. telling her to \"get her shit together\" n that she should \"grow up\" after neglecting her..is crazy ngl. she takes YOU out n does things for you because she loves you. you don\u2019t even have to do the most..you didn\u2019t even do something small with her to show that you cared??  just a TEXT??

Acknowledging a partners need is a basic tenet of a healthy relationship.", "Oof, YTA. Just read that back and tell me you don't see why. Hope you learned something for the next one, because she's gone.", "YTA\nTime and effort.  All your priorities seem to be work based  you need to find a balance.   \n\nyou sent her a happy birthday text come on ringing her would of meant so much more\n\nYour clearly not that into the relationship let her find someone that going to let her shine and get the treatment she deserves", "YTA. Six years, you see her 1x/week at the most and you made zero effort to do anything for her bday. Zero. Not even a card. Or an ice cream. You are the one who needs to grow up and realize that you treat people as if you care if you want to 'date' them.", "YTA. Sounds like you don\u2019t even like this girl at all to be honest. She seems like a keeper. \n\nHopefully someone else will take care of her now. Lol", "While I want to give you sympathy because I\u2019ve been in this situation I can\u2019t.\n\nFirst off to say she doesn\u2019t like flowers is complete bs she is probably just letting you down easy because she knows you don\u2019t have the means to send them. While she may seem fine with you not sending flowers she did refer to her \u201cclient\u201d (who I\u2019m certain she has feelings for) who sent her stuff on her birthday. The fact alone that she got gifts from someone other than you would bother tf out of me. And to be fair it\u2019s out of place for a client to do this but if he knows her birthday so well as much as her favorite food that\u2019s a red flag in its self. I\u2019m sure there has been some off the counter things you haven\u2019t noticed maybe due to work or intellect. Either way I\u2019m sure she was being unfair with this said client.\n\nSecond you put work before the one you supposedly would want to spend forever with. This might just be me but my father has really never been around as he is tending to his successful business and leaving me my sister and mom alone most nights. Work and relationships do not work well and the second you put work before family (or in this case your gf) they start falling out of love and begin to grow a hatred towards you. This is exactly what happened. You\u2019re telling me out of allllllll the days allowed there wasn\u2019t one day you could visit her even if it was for 30 minutes to explain that she means everything to you and that you will make it up to her one day.\n\nThird you are making excuses for her being better off than you. That and love have no significance to each other. If you truly love someone then anything else would come after them and it was clear to her and frankly the rest of us that working for a whole month and not finding a single day to spend time with her was more important. (I highly doubt you worked every single day for a whole month based on your lack to stick to love for 6 years) \n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong OP but this was a mistake on your end and you are the asshole. Love is not one sided you got too comfortable with her being lenient to your lack of showing love and this is why you are blocked on everything.", "Lol YTA you are not the main character in this world. Lol jerk", "YTA. It's not about the money (although clearly you're very hung up on that) it's the fact that you don't seem at all interested in putting effort into your relationship.

Yes, yta, you whole post is so full of envy for your gf's life I wouldn't be surprised if you were pea green.

I hope this is a learning experience for you.", "YTA. And out of touch with reality.\n\n\"She's lovely but...\" You're jealous of her wealth.\n\nWe've been together for six years, but... You're not married, not engaged, not living together, haven't even seen her in a month? You're not \"together,\" and from what you've told us, that's totally on you, not her.\n\nIf she were the one writing, I'd suggest she move on, but it looks like she's figured that out all on her own. Clever woman!", "YTA.\n\nOne this post reeks of your insecurity. Between the two of you. You're actually the one who needs to grow the f* ck up more. \n\nHonestly, most men really fail women when it comes to celebrating milestone/yearly important events and congratulations you are now a member of those incompetent men.\n\nI'm glad your ex ( and yes ) she's your ex now that she doesn't need to belittle herself in order to grow your poor little manly ego.

Get your head out of you ass and work on yourself while she continues to live her life, happily.", "Oof. Hope you didn\u2019t throw your back out with all that effort you put in. /s\n\nBut, hey. At least you clearly demonstrated how much you cared (which is not at all). I think it\u2019s safe to say she got the picture. I know you can\u2019t edit the title, but you may want to edit the post to say \u201cex girlfriend\u201d or just \u201cex\u201d would suffice. Because, yeah. She\u2019s gone, man. \n\nAt least now she can date someone who isn\u2019t envious of her wealth to the point of bitterness. I\u2019m sure the next guy (maybe her client?) will actually make an effort to see her more than once a month. \n\nI do love a happy ending. \n\nOh, and YTA.", "That\u2019s it? You sent her a text? Oh wow, how thoughtful. /s\n\nYou\u2019re not putting any effort into this relationship at all. You\u2019ve been together 6 years, you should know how much birthdays and celebrations mean to her. You didn\u2019t take her out because *you* don\u2019t like celebrating \u2014 her birthday isn\u2019t about you! It\u2019s become clear to her and everyone reading you\u2019ve simply stopped caring about this relationship.", "You\u2019re right. You didn\u2019t forget. You just didn\u2019t care enough to make an effort. And no,the text is bare minimum and weak."]}
