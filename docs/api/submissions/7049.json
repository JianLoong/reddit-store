If mom is only 30 then she had her at 14/15? That\u2019s too young to have the life skills needed as a parent. I expect there may be some long buried issues there that mom is dealing with and yelling and trying to shame her as a bad parent isn\u2019t helpful. I doubt she\u2019s open to therapy but she really needs it to have an outlet to discuss her feelings and maybe learn how to better communicate with her daughter.", "All this because of yelling?

What a toxic af family", "ESH\n\nThis situation is just really sad.  She had her child at 13?

I really really hate to do this OP because I'd probably react the same as you did but ESH. 1st off.. your sister is a HUGE AH.. there's no arguing that fact. Her crap attitude and treatment of her daughter ruined that day and pissed off the rest of your family. She has no one to blame but herself there! \n\nHowever, your parents are right. Your sis can choose the way she wants to raise her daughter. It'll most likely destroy any future relationship they'll have the way she's going but it's her right as the parent. Also, if your niece wants to go back to her mom please don't try and argue with her about it. She's has enough to deal with already with her mom. Be her place of comfort and safety when she needs it.

No. She's just living with me now and she's fine!", "That's the thing: she doesn't want to go back to her mom. But if she doesn't, her mom may call the cops on me for kidnapping.", "Talk to an attorney where you live. Different jurisdictions have different rules.  At 16 especially this may be legal.

Would your mom be willing to talk your sis into giving your niece permission to stay with you on a temporary basis? Maybe she could just see her mom on the weekends until things cool down?", "True. Thank you for opening my eyes. I really need to figure this one out. I'll probably let my niece go back home but if her mom does something again then I'll get the cops involved.", "My nieces dad passed away long ago.

She had at child at 14. She was a child herself. Has she ever had therapy? What kind of support has she had from your family? This is a really complex issue and she isn't a pantomime/Disney villain.", "You need to bring her back and if you really want her to live with you she will need to go to court to be emancipated but it\u2019s a long process and she would need evidence of mistreatment or abuse.", "Well, I mean your niece is still a minor and can\u2019t actually make those sorts of decisions without the approval of their parent/guardian (your sister), and I think you can get a jail sentence for that.", "for the love of god please contact social services and her school about this. At the very least social services need to be informed so your ahead of the curve with this if her mom decides to go to the police. \n\nThat is what you need to do and she needs to agree to cooperating with if she wants to keep living with you. \n\nAlso check the rights 16 year olds have where you live. (Social services still need to be informed regardless but you would be able to minimise detail)", "idk, this honestly sounds like a police matter at this point, if you believe your niece is in danger. you seem like you have good intentions, so i was probably not right to call you a kidnapper, but legally that's sort of how it looks. i don't want to make any recommendations, just be careful.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily the wrong thing to do, but it may be illegal. You need to speak with a family lawyer in your jurisdiction immediately.", "I'm really not sure of all the legalities especially with your niece being 16 (old enough to decide where she wants to stay). You may also want to consult with a family law attorney as well just to get all the info you can. CPS could end up getting called in on this to investigate as well especially if the police is involved.", "Yes yes yes, get out in front of this. Talk to all the authorities, get neice to speak for herself as well.

I bet the screaming and yelling ruined the party all by themselves.", "Nta I have even read your comments.\n\nPlease call the police and your children's social services, depending on country and from what I hear about America state or county as all laws are different.\n\nRegardless keep any record of threats made against your neice and yourself.
