She\u2019s TA", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s messed up how your sister treats her daughter. It also sounds like the daughter doesn\u2019t understand that her mom isn\u2019t supposed to treat her this way so she may benefit from therapy", "NTA for defending niece, but you can\u2019t simply keep her away from her mother. If mom is only 30 then she had her at 14/15? That\u2019s too young to have the life skills needed as a parent. I expect there may be some long buried issues there that mom is dealing with and yelling and trying to shame her as a bad parent isn\u2019t helpful. I doubt she\u2019s open to therapy but she really needs it to have an outlet to discuss her feelings and maybe learn how to better communicate with her daughter.", "All this because of yelling? ESH.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like a narcissist, she just didn't like getting called out in front of people but its okay for her to yell at your neice in front of them?

What a toxic af family", "ESH\n\nThis situation is just really sad.  She had her child at 13?  That must be really difficult.\n\nShe does sound like a bad mum but you can't just take her child, what you have done is very illegal. If you believe the child is being abused or neglected you need to go through the official channels.", "Oh man... I really really hate to do this OP because I'd probably react the same as you did but ESH. 1st off.. your sister is a HUGE AH.. there's no arguing that fact. Her crap attitude and treatment of her daughter ruined that day and pissed off the rest of your family. She has no one to blame but herself there! \n\nHowever, your parents are right. Your sis can choose the way she wants to raise her daughter. It'll most likely destroy any future relationship they'll have the way she's going but it's her right as the parent. Also, if your niece wants to go back to her mom please don't try and argue with her about it. She's has enough to deal with already with her mom. Be her place of comfort and safety when she needs it.

Send your niece home so you're legally in the right - morally you're good, but not legally.  Then talk to a lawyer about options where you live - can your niece be emancipated, what happens if you call CPS, etc.  Only talk to your sister after that.", "This is so heartbreaking to read! It seems like you have a whole journey ahead of you trying to do what\u2019s right for your niece, and I wish you all the best! I\u2019m so glad your niece has you and your brother in her life, because she knows, and you know, that what your sister is doing is not normal and not acceptable.", "Custodial interference?", "Maybe I should return her. Thing is, she doesn't want to go back home. She consented to staying with me for now. But I know her mom can easily turn things around. I'm scared of letting her go.", "Like 3 days ago. She's doing okay, but really doesn't want to go back to her mother yet, which is messed up because my sister hasn't consented to her living with me. It'll take a lot time to figure this whole thing out but I need to do it for my niece's sake.", "It's complicated at 16 in a lot of places.  In some places 16yos can legally move out on their own.", "Legally perhaps OP can't, but I'd argue morally she has a pretty solid case. Yeah I'd agree that having a child at 14 probably fucked up the sister. Therapy would probably help. But there is a child being actively harmed right now, and the child who can still be helped takes priority over the former child who unfortunately wasn't helped.", "What? No. She's just living with me now and she's fine!", "That's the thing: she doesn't want to go back to her mom. But if she doesn't, her mom may call the cops on me for kidnapping.", "Talk to an attorney where you live. Different jurisdictions have different rules.  At 16 especially this may be legal. Don't take internet randos' advice.  They don't even know where you live.", "Unfortunately in this case, it\u2019s still kidnapping unless the mother consents to it. If you\u2019re that scared of what may happen, then you need to go further and call the police now, before your sister does, and explain it to them. \n\nI know you mean well and you\u2019re only looking out for your niece, but this can turn south for you very quickly.", "Do you have a long term plan for your neice? Are you willing to involve CPS? Or get her emancipated? Where is your niece's dad?\n\nYou need to have an honest conversation with your neice about how often her mom screams at her and if there are any other forms of abuse.", "She would have been 14 when she had the child.", "She may be family but she is still a minor who\u2019s parents didn\u2019t consent to them being taken.

That is kidnapping. Expect the cops to show up at your door.", "i mean legally yeah you kidnapped her. she isnt an adult and can\u2019t make those choices so yes technically you kidnapped her", "As others have said, you have basically kidnapped a minor. Doesn't matter that she is family and that she went with you of her own free will, you have taken a minor from her home without her parents consent.\n\nPut her in the car and take her back before the police show up at your door", "On man.. yea OP she can't just stay with you like that as much as she would most likely benefit from it. Would your mom be willing to talk your sis into giving your niece permission to stay with you on a temporary basis? Maybe she could just see her mom on the weekends until things cool down?", "True. Thank you for opening my eyes. I really need to figure this one out. I'll probably let my niece go back home but if her mom does something again then I'll get the cops involved.", "My nieces dad passed away long ago. And regarding my niece, she told her that this happens almost everyday, especially when her mom gets drunk. I'm considering making her lose her parental rights due to her addiction.", "Yeah, makes sense now...", "My niece first suggested she lives with me because she's scared of what her mom could do after they got back home. I agreed. Genuinely asking, was that the wrong thing to do? Because her mom, aside of that, threateningly said through text that \"if she catches her [my niece]...\". I just got scared for her.", "I'll talk to her about it when she's done with her work. Then again she doesn't see anything wrong with how my sister treats my niece so I have no idea where this could go. I appreciate the advice though. Maybe I should get the police involved.", "At the very least, you and your family need to make it clear to your sister you will call CPS or the police without hesitation if (when) she does that again.\n\nIf you really are afraid for your niece, I wouldn\u2019t kick the can down the road and call them now. I\u2019m sure you know it will happen again so you\u2019d only be subjecting your niece to one more verbal lashing.\n\nBest of luck to you", "It's time to legally pursue guardianship. I hope you are able to keep your neice safe.", "Call CPS and see about an emergency custody order if you plan to keep your niece. If she's in danger at home they will intervene and they'll look favourably on you taking her in over going into foster care as they like to keep families together where possible.\n\n\nAlso, it sounds as if your sister has been horrid to lits of people but if you can do try to have some compassion for her. She had at child at 14. She was a child herself. Has she ever had therapy? What kind of support has she had from your family? This is a really complex issue and she isn't a pantomime/Disney villain.", "You need to bring her back and if you really want her to live with you she will need to go to court to be emancipated but it\u2019s a long process and she would need evidence of mistreatment or abuse.", "Well, I mean your niece is still a minor and can\u2019t actually make those sorts of decisions without the approval of their parent/guardian (your sister), and I think you can get a jail sentence for that.", "for the love of god please contact social services and her school about this. At the very least social services need to be informed so your ahead of the curve with this if her mom decides to go to the police. \n\nThat is what you need to do and she needs ti agree ti cooperating with if she wants to keep living with you. \n\nAlso check the rights 16 year olds have where you live. (Social services still need to be informed regardless but you would be able to minimise detail)", "idk, this honestly sounds like a police matter at this point, if you believe your niece is in danger. you seem like you have good intentions, so i was probably not right to call you a kidnapper, but legally that's sort of how it looks. i don't want to make any recommendations, just be careful.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily the wrong thing to do, but it may be illegal. You need to speak with a family lawyer in your jurisdiction immediately.", "I'm really not sure of all the legalities especially with your niece being 16 (old enough to decide where she wants to stay). You may also want to consult with a family law attorney as well just to get all the info you can. CPS could end up getting called in on this to investigate as well especially if the police is involved.", "Yes yes yes, get out in front of this. Talk to all the authorities, get neice to speak for herself as well. A minor saying they are afraid to go home has a lot of weight in a situation like this.\n\nBut if OP is called out for kidnapping before coming forward, everything could go sliding down the hill.", "Yeah, it makes sense legally. I should return her.", "NTA and please check with an actual lawyer before sending her back to your sister. There is a lot of misinformation in this thread about kidnapping. If you can\u2019t afford a lawyer, then post this on one of the legal advice subreddits.", "You can't just take someone else's child. That is literally kidnapping and you could got to prison.", "NTA, it\u2019s what she needed to hear", "NTA: your sister was verbally abusing your niece in front of everyone, during a party, which is the most embarrassing situation a teen could be in. She called her and her friends dumb and then got upset when you defended her, she needs to seek help.", "NTA\n\nYour sister humiliated herself by screaming and making an unhinged scene towards your niece in front of everyone\n\nYour niece also needs to not be making passive aggressive \"jokes\" that only exacerbate the issue.\n\nShe's 16, so old enough to decide if she wants to stay elsewhere. You may need to get CPS and law enforcement involved though, she's still a minor under her mother's custody.\n\nYou could be charged with kidnapping if you forcibly keep her from them. Document EVERYTHING", "Try to go for guardianship. Ex parte first for temporary then standard guardianship for full time", "Nta, she shouldn't be yelling at her daughter at all and doing it at her own birthday party is her ruining her own party. I cant understand how anyone would be on her side when she started screaming at her daughter in a gathering.", "NTA if called police will ask niece and in most states niece will be allowed to stay with uncle won\u2019t force niece to go back unless she wants", "I\u2019m calling bs on this whole post because your sister would have been 14 when she got pregnant.", "NTA. I bet the screaming and yelling ruined the party all by themselves.", "Nta I have even read your comments.\n\nPlease call the police and your children's social services, depending on country and from what I hear about America state or county as all laws are different.\n\nRegardless keep any record of threats made against your neice and yourself. They could be used for a restraining order or protection order (country's again). \n\nYou sound like an awesome uncle who just wants to care. So make sure you are able to provide her with a safe environment and help her start organising any money she has into a fund, so she is able to move out especially since your sister has sobriety issues.\n\nBut you have to be there to help her, so getting done for kidnapping won't help. \n\nGo through the police cps and maybe even have a lawyer if you know one go over the legalities where you live.", "NTA \n\nSpeak to an attorney. The state where I live, despite 16 being a minor, a child *can't* legally be forced to return to their parents. If you can legally keep niece with you, that would be safer for her.\n\nYour sister humiliated herself.", "NTA but this is the second post on the front page in which people are risking serious prison time. You really need to make sure you won\u2019t be charged with kidnapping.", "NTA  \nHowever, you sadly cannot keep your niece with you and will have to return her to her (albeit horrible) mom.

OP\u2019s sister clearly needs therapy, not to be shamed for having a hard time.", "OP said that her niece wanted to live with her because she was terrified of what her mom could have done when they got home.

Effectively you can use them to forbid contact with a person, Ie mom can't have contact with niece.

At that point my mom gave up trying to do something about it. I always tried my best to be empathetic towards my sister since she didn't have an easy life at all but I couldn't stand her letting it all out on my niece.
