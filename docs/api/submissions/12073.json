For real. Let the court sort it out", "I don't really wanna take my family to court because they will end up with criminal convictions no??my brother I don't really care, but my mother is elderly", "Yeah it was through probate, and I have all the letters from the solicitors who were dealing with probate, he didn't leave a will unfortunately, but me my brother are hid heirs", "I swear this sounds like a Lifetime made for tv movie.", "Honestly I wish it wasn't true", "100% one of the worst ones I've made in my life, and I've made a few silly ones \ud83e\udd26", "Civil court is about money only.  Criminal court is separate as far as I know.  That said IANAL", "No, civil court is about money only. You can ask a lawyer to confirm, but you can take someone to civil court without a criminal conviction going on their record.", "They're not going to send an old lady to prison for this.  They will cut a deal and make her pay you back.  Your brother had nothing to do with this unless he threatened your mother into spending the money, in which case he will be prosecuted.  It was in her account, it was her choice.", "This story doesn't add up. You don't know the difference between civil and criminal court while going through the system. *Your* money would not have been transferred to another party without your consent, so I question if it actually was yours to begin with.\n\n\n\nThe sentence does make sense assuming you were charged with manslaughter while using a weapon.\n\n\nWhether you are TA or not is a broader question. You can certainly write your family off, and it sounds like you have a lot of misgivings towards both your brother and mother. My advise is to move on, as you claim you are doing, since they don't seem to have your well-being at heart.\n\n\nGood luck. Stay away from drugs, drug users, and drug dealers if you have a PO.", "They obviously don\u2019t give AF about you dude, sue them in civil court", "They didn't care about you when they spent your money. Return the favour.", "You are NTA. You sue them in civil court, 20k may be in the limits of small claims in your state. If it\u2019s higher you have to decide whether suing for the small claims max or moving to a higher court for the full 20k would be the better move for you. 20k could help set your life back up, don\u2019t let them steal that better future from you! It sounds like you\u2019ve already given years of your life from them and then they robbed you.", "Yes, bring all the paper and any text or emails or social media related to it! Bring them every and see if you have a case.", "Understandable, I personally would be more upset over 4 years gone than 20k gone. Definitely should cut them off and do your best to thrive in life. Good luck out there.", "Correct. Though $20k is way outside the boundaries of small claims court. Usually they're capped at a few grand, $3-5k. The burden of proof in civil cases is much lower than criminal cases.", "She was giving it to him to spend to pay for his drug use, and itnis my belief that he bullied her into it, though I'm not 100% on that as I wasn't there", "My money was transferred into my mother's account as I was in prison and do not have a bank account, I was not charged with manslaughter as the man did not die(luckily) I am in England and was charged with grievous bodily harm with intent.

She's already made it clear she's always going to pick your brother.  She stood by him when he sent you to prison.  She gave him your money.  Sue her and get back what you can.  It's not easy to rebuild a life after serving time; you're going to need that moeny.", "I don't know UK law, but in the US they can't just transfer funds arbitrarily; it would have sat and waited until you were released. It  would also be a parole officer instead of a probation officer here (parole is for sentenced, probation implies no guilty verdict on an obvious felony count).\n\n\nGood luck. Keep yourself away from anyone who will get you in trouble. Cut everyone off and move forward alone if needed.", "Hurt your mother? People facing the consequences of their actions in a civil court is not hurting them.\n\nCruel to be kind, tough love, etc. Sometimes people need to learn a lesson, the lesson she must learn is to stop enabling your brother because it only hurts her and him as well.", "Talk to a solicitor. It's the same basic thing -- American courts were largely based on English courts and common law.
