And if he had been, I'm sure he would have fought it -legally- tooth and nail.  How do I know?  The will he wrote later speaks for him.\n\nIt is a legal loophole.   The 2nd wife is clearly entitled to claim part of the house.  Not legally, but morally.  And if the father had been smarter, the 2nd  wife  would also have a legal claim, per the wishes of the father.", "not true based on OP comment.  they owned it jointly, but the mother had set the children up as beneficiary.  it was absolutely his, it just seemed as though he didn't realize the will wouldn't override the beneficiary deed/didn't know about it.", "not true based on OP comment.  they owned it jointly, but the mother had set the children up as beneficiary.  it was absolutely his, it just seemed as though he didn't realize the will wouldn't override the beneficiary deed/didn't know about it.", "not true based on OP comment.  they owned it jointly, but the mother had set the children up as beneficiary.  it was absolutely his, it just seemed as though he didn't realize the will wouldn't override the beneficiary deed/didn't know about it.", "trying to get a competitive price is not a \"greedy ass who doesn't deserve anything\".  it was 10%... \n\nalso, the house was absolutely his.  there's a lot of confidently incorrect people here who haven't read OPs comment.  they joint owned it.", "He's not alive and as events have shown, what he might have agreed or disagreed is irrelevant.  She tried to pressure them to give her more than the property was worth", "actually no OP\u2019s mother trumps the dad\u2019s will and stepmom\u2019s wishes. mom wanted the family home to go to her kids years before stepmom was ever in the picture", "OP says the beneficiary deed was signed and filed by BOTH mom and dad while mom was still alive. It trumps the will.", "Not according to law. If that was the case the deed would not trump the will.", "Op stated in the comment that the dad signed it so he knew about it.", "Yes is is when you got everything else! And if the father co owned it then his will would have still been into play. It sounds like mom owned the house and put the deed in the kids name.\n\n\nEven still they owe her nothing.

You don't get released from a promise because you secretly didn't think it was fair.", "That assumes the home was (at one time) owned entirely by the mom, and that the dad's name was not on the deed.  That's not a valid assumption, given what has been posted so far.", "which part was not according to the law?", "or forgot or didn't understand.  it happens.  he certainly owned it though", "OP literally says the joint owned it.  you don't understand how a beneficiary deed works. \n\n>She got more then enough for the 5 years they where together.\n\nlol so much hate for someone you don't know.  get a grip", "yeah let\u2019s not believe the multiple lawyers that say the original deed triumphs the will I\u2019m sure you graduated top of your class at Harvard Law \ud83d\udc4d", "He did but he wasn\u2019t sole owner", "From a legal point of view, you are correct.  In the eyes of the law, OP would not be an AH.  But that's not what this group is about.  If YTA, then YTA...even if the law states you did nothing wrong.", "It's *\"trumps\"*, not *triumphs*. LoL"]}
