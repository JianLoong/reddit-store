My suspicion is that he was worried we would turn her out on the street, despite the fact we assured him nothing like that would happen. As it is, we've been helpful in assisting her with getting set up with the rest of her inheritance (material items, contents of his bank accounts, life insurance payout, pension, etc), which sets her up to live comfortably the rest of her life.\n\nHis widow decided early on that she no longer wishes to live in our father's house and wants us to buy out her share. She is standing firm at roughly 1.1 times the number she would mostly likely get if we sold the house and split the profit.
