Your father wasn't a lawyer versed on the finer points of law.  AFTER the deed, your father wrote a will in which he wanted some of the equity in the home to go to his new wife.

Seems like it was never hers to begin with and was always meant for you.

Use the deed to legally change the ownership to yourself and your siblings.  \n\nAs you state, your father's widow has enough money for the remainder of her life.  There's no necessity for you to voluntarily give her some of your money as well.", "According to your post, your step-mother does not own a share of the house.  It was deeded to you and your siblings by your mother (who I assume was the legal owner) before the step-mother even came into the picture.  If you pay her anything, it would be essentially a gift from the three of you and take away from YOUR inheritance.   If your step-mother is splitting everything that she received from the will with all of you, then I would say to pay her a share of the house.  If she is keeping everything that she received from the will according to the law, I recommend that you do the same.  If you have not already informed her about the deed, do not do so until she has moved out and one of you has taken possession.  In the US a surviving spouse often has the legal right to stay in the marital home until they die.  The law could be similar in your jurisdiction as well.  In either case, you do not want an angry step-mother still in possession of the house when she finds out she gets nothing for it.\n\nNTA", "[deleted]", "I have personal reaction to this...so idk if it's clouding my judgment, but nonetheless, NTA.", "NTA, she was never supposed to have the house and it apparently wasn\u2019t even his to give.

Your father didn't have the right to will it to her, and had she not tried to pressure you for more than her (false) share, you wouldn't have found out about the deed in time to contest the will before payout. She brought this on herself.

Even that would be invalid though given that the property was not his to give away.\n\nHer decision to play hardball was her mistake, not yours.   Her disappointment is not something you should feel obligated to assuage.", "NTA and your dad lived there for 5 years when it was left to you and siblings. Of course you would want your father to have a home but that has run its course. Your stepmother doesn't have a say. Your attorney has advised you.

The house was apparently his mother's sole property.  Even though dad may have *assumed* that he had rights of survivorship the actual deed makes it clear that was not the case.    The widow has no standing whatsoever in the ownership.", "No he wasn't the house  belonged only to the mother the house was never his to give", "Your confusion is because you don't understand property law.
