That's the teacher's problem. See, you have no obligation to financially support your sibling unless you feel like doing so. What ended up happening here for your little bro is he just received a very important life lesson: sometimes we have to do things we find unpleasant in order to earn money to treat ourselves. \n\nI do have a possible compromise? Perhaps your brother can earn the $10 from you in exchange for doing a chore for you? Babysitting rates are WAY higher than $10, so honestly there he'd have probably been a sucker to accept that rate--unless he was gonna end up making MORE?
