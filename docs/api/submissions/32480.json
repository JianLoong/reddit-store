I mean just googling my own city's school lunch program, you're paying $3.00 a meal anyway, so it's literally a $2 upgrade.", "NTA your brother could have very easily done a couple chores to earn the $10 but actively chose not to for silly reasons.

I'm not asking for a prize or anything, just explaining my perspective as an older sibling. It's literally my job as the oldest to be a good example to my siblings, and the fact that the brother refused to do simple chores to earn money, shows that he believes he's entitled to get money from OP for free. That's not a good mindset to get into as you get older. Ten years old is plenty old enough to know the value of money and the value of work. I'm barely an adult so it's not like I haven't been a kid in so long that I'm out of touch, but I was raised to be responsible. Also how does my attitude say that I don't like my siblings?
