They can go take a hike.", "You are never obligated to spend time with people that make you feel bad or hurt you. \n\nNTA but you need to develop the skill of communicating how you feel before it reaches a point where you lash out because its important for others to respect your boundaries but that cannot do that if they don't know what they are. \n\nIt would be a good idea to right out an explanation for your dad on why you don't want your cousins to attend your match and how they have made you feel (ideally with examples of what they have done that made you feel that way). \n\nYou didn't include your age here but you sound young and I think it's too much to expect you to explain things to your aunt at this point and it's fair to ask your dad to tell her that/why it's best they don't attend your match. \n\nIf at this point you have told your dad how you feel about your cousins and that you don't want to be around them then you will have established that boundary with your dad and it becomes his responsibility to respect it. \n\nIf he doesn't (like if he tells you to get over it or doesn't respect your wishes) then that would make him the asshole and I'm sorry he hasn't developed that skill yet and if you need advice for trying to navigate that feel free to DM me. \n\nHopefully though he'll respect your needs and you can continue to grow in your communication skills. \n\nGood luck kid!!", "In this situation, I would say you are NTA for not wanting to acknowledge your cousins as your cousins after they have mistreated you for years. Your feelings are valid, and it's understandable that their sudden interest in acknowledging the family connection after your success might not feel genuine.\n\nHowever, if you decide to give them a chance to make amends and demonstrate their sincerity, it might lead to a better understanding and possibly a healthier relationship moving forward.
