He never went to school to learn how to play. He was taught by his grandfather who was taught by his father and so on.  \n\nHe was my uncle on my mom's side and he was my hero. He was a tiny little man who could play a guitar like a god and women would fall in love with him because of his voice. He only had eyes for my aunt though. She is my mom's baby sister. \n\nWhen I was six I asked him if he could teach me to play. He said it was hard work and that he wasn't a good teacher but yes he would teach me. \n\nI spent years learning from him. And then he died when I was 15. I continued to study the guitar and attended university on a musical scholarship. \n\nMy cousins are now in their teens and have never really shown any interest in learning how to play. My aunt started asking me to give them lessons. So I did. For six months. They showed no interest, no dedication, and no aptitude. \n\nAfter six months I just couldn't do it any more. I felt drained whenever I spent time teaching them. They had no drive. No spark. I was getting depressed from seeing my teacher's children have none of his ability. \n\nI talked to my aunt about it. She admitted that she was forcing them to get guitar lessons. I told her that her children may have talents that lay in other areas. They are both gifted athletes and do well in school. She said that she understood and didn't make them come for lessons any more.  \n\nMy mom says my aunt misses hearing music playing in her house. And that the kids learning wasn't really the point. I play my uncles guitar and she wanted to hear it. And that I took it away. And that I need to be more mindful of what others have done for me. \n\nI feel like an asshole for not understanding. \n\nI have hundreds, maybe  thousands, of hours of recordings of my uncle playing and I put them all on a hard drive for her. Not just audio but video of all his lessons. And performances at parties and family gatherings. \n\nI showed my aunt how to watch them and put them on her phone. \n\nBut I still feel bad giving up on my cousins.", "created_utc": 1690753052, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dxae9/aita_for_not_giving_my_cousins_guitar_lessons/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The recordings are good for her but if you have the time go over to her house and play his guitar for her.", "NTA. You tried, but you can't force your cousin's to be interested in guitars.", "NTA she admitted she forced them into learning. I get she's still grieving but that wasn't the right way to go about it. She could have spoken to you without involving her children, and then you could have made the hard drive for her sooner of all the footage etc. \n\nYou have nothing to feel guilty for. Your cousins don't have an interest in music and that isn't you giving up on them, it's them just not having those skills and that should be okay. They are his children and that should be enough for your Aunt to still have a part of him through just having them. \n\nYour Mom a little ITA for making the comment she did to you like it's all on you to have known how your Aunt was feeling, when she never really took the time to let you know. People seem to forget we're not all psychics/mind readers and they need to communicate better.", "NTA. You did a nice thing for your aunt. Maybe go over every once in a while and play his guitar for her.", "NTA. If she really missed hearing music, she\u2019d pick up the guitar for herself. If her children aren\u2019t interested, it\u2019s wasting both their time and your own. Offer her guitar lessons. There\u2019s no point in forcing the children to learn guitar if they do not like it.", "NTA. You didn't give up on them because it's not like they even wanted to do it. Your alternative was a great idea, and will give them all things to remember and talk about.", "NTA. You didn't take anything away, you're carrying on with your Uncle's legacy. Your Aunt doesn't seem to recognize this.\n\nIts a sad situation for your Aunt , but her kids, who she was forcing to learn to play, had no interest in playing guitar and you were wasting your time.\n\nIt was very kind of you to put your Uncles music on a hard drive for her. Hopefully it will give her some comfort.", "That's just like, your mom's opinion bro. And even if she's accurate about that you and aunt already talked it out and she sounded gracious when the lessons were stopped.\n\nNTA", "NTA, if they didn't want to learn you can't change that", "NTA.  I was forced into piano lessons as a kid along with my brother.  My brother was pretty much a prodigy and began getting gigs and stuff at like 11 years old.  I hated it and it became a real relationship killer between my brother and I.  If the kids don\u2019t want to play, they don\u2019t want to play.", "NTA. These stories aren't supposed to make you cry", "NTA I do think it would be very kind of you to make some time and go over to just play for your aunt, obviously she\u2019s having troubles missing him and it would be a lovely gesture.", "NTA. your aunt is literally using you and causing both you and her children discomfort because she misses her husband. Which I completely understand and I'm sorry to all of you for your loss, he sounded like a great guy. But there's ways of dealing with your grief and this isn't it. She's being T A and so is your mother.", "I was totally prepared to call you the AH when I read the title; but no, NTA at all. My job is to teach a sport/skill that parents sometimes push on their kids. It\u2019s absolutely soul sucking to watch someone fumble around at AND DISLIKE something you are passionate about. \n\nIt sounds like these kids would rather be doing absolutely anything else with their time. Everyone needed to be let off the hook here.", "NTA and arranging recordings for her was above and beyond.", "NTA. It would be AH behaviour to force them to do it. Let them maybe decide later if they want another go, and then be there for them if they want.\n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You cannot force these things.", "NTA. You tried your best and they simply weren\u2019t interested.", "NTA.  In the beginning, there was music.  In the end, there will be music.  In between, there is a lot of practice.\n\nYour aunt wants this for herself - she misses her husband.  Understandable, but you can't force people to do something that requires dedication and a desire to do it.  These kids will never feel that if they haven't already.....teaching people who don't really care will just drain you.  Your uncle passed his knowledge onto you - eventually you may well pass it on again, but only when the right person comes along.....", "NTA your mother is for making you feel bad. You cannot push a cart sideways. They didn\u2019t want to learn and that\u2019s okay. It is not bad at all. You did a great thing for you aunt and let it be. Move along.", "NTA. Jesus. Your mom and aunt want you to pretend to be your uncle's ghost. You are super mindful. You gave them six months of your precious time. You did not give up on your cousins.

Especially because your music started with his lessons and is a last extension of him. Cheers and be well, making those recordings available to her was also amazingly kind OP :)"]}
