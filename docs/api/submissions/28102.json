Also if anything, continuing with your job so the customers don't get angry and come inside complaining probably made things easier for your coworker. So you did help them in an indirect way.", "NTA\n\nA manager was trying to talk to them.  More people surrounding a person during a panic attack isn't better. Manager is also the one authorized to send them home or similar.", "So you covered more of what she should have been helping with?  If so you were helping.  NTA.   If you got mad at her you would be, but it sounds like you just made sure what needed to be done was done.", "NTA you aren't a medical professional. You aren't the company therapist. You did your job, which is what you were there to do.", "NTA It\u2019s not your job. Let your boss handle it.", "NTA - you had other responsibilities to take care of. Your manager tried to step in and deal with it, but was unsuccessful. Had you stepped in to help your co-worker, then things really would have fallen apart and you would likely have been blamed for neglecting your duties.", "NTA that\u2019s the mangers job.", "NTA\nThere was someone already aware of what was happening, and there was work to do.", "NTA - Your co-worker's mental issues aren't your problem. If anything, you need to stay in \"that zone\" and keep working harder to make up for their lack so that customers aren't as inconvenienced. Plus, paying attention to the panic attack will have the possibility of making her even more disturbed and cause more anxiety, so yeah, don't do it. If I were your manager though, I would seriously consider replacing her. There are many other people out there that can do her job without breaking down like that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She was being helped by a manager and you focused on keeping work going.", "I would have done the same.", "NTA, I would actually appreciate someone help handle my workload if I was dealing with a panic attack or other health episode.

You did your job. Granted, you may have been able to help your coworker too, but that\u2019s not your responsibility. Plus, everyone deals with panic/anxiety attacks differently. What works for one person might do nothing for another. \n\nYour heart was in the right place. Maybe you could give your manager and coworker tips for next time. See if that helps I. The future.

My job (shift lead at a fast food place) had such toxic upper management it affected my mental and physical health to the point of a mandatory doctor visit that yielded nothing, and it got so bad I had to quit. I would cry between orders or have someone else take drive while I did back of house stuff, I didn\u2019t get upset when people did their jobs, wasn\u2019t waiting for people to comfort me. I didn\u2019t need to be coddled, I needed to be distracted and given room and space to settle down the internal turmoil. Coddling her might\u2019ve caused her panic attack to get worse for all you know, you did her a favour by quietly covering for her instead of making a big deal.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur manager was taking care of her, no reason for you to engage. Two people can not do more tha one, and you did motre to take over some of her job, that's already generous.", "Thanks, I was being very efficient getting all the drinks made ahead of time so my coworker didn't need to help and she could just hand them out quick.", "Seriously.  You were doing her job for her, what else did she want!", "also another thought-  ignoring it may have made her feel less embarassed.", "I hadn't thought about too many people crowding around making it worse.  I honestly didn't know she still worked there.  Hadn't seen her in weeks or on the schedule.  I was stationed right beside her already so it was very obvious.  I was making 100% of the drinks and taking the lobby orders too.  Not a complete rush that night.  Somehow she got positive survey reviews from customers probably from desperately begging for them.", "Yea, she probably isn't cut out for that type of fast paced environment."]}
