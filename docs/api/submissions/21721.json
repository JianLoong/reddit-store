Its you body and your choice.", "NTA. These are two grown adults who decided to have a baby.

I have adult asthma because my father smoked my entire life and in the 80s and 90s no one knew about the dangers of 2nd hand smoke. \n\nBut 3rd hand smoke is real too. You wouldn't know because smokers get \"nose blind\" I never smelled smoke on my clothes as a kid but I found out that I indeed reeked of smoke despite taking normal showers and washing my clothes regularly. I didn't even notice that at my parents home until I had move out and had gone there after having not lived there. It reeked and immediately hurt my breathing and burned my eyes. \n\nThis is why they expect you to stop smoking. The smoke/nicotine sticks to your clothing. So, if you're watching the baby, and you go into the garage to smoke, then come back, it's all over your clothes. So when you hold or play with the baby, they are breathing it in.\n\nI know you don't believe it. Smokers never believe their habit hurts anyone but themselves, but you're wrong.

Especially having the nerve to go spinning some sob story to everyone to get them mad at you.\n\nTo add on to this ignore everyone saying YTA for just not quitting smoking. As a former smoker myself who quit a few years back they are out of their minds suggesting someone quit cold who has been a daily smoker for that many years. Withdrawal can and does kill people. OP isn't an AH for smoking either. It's her body. It has no bearing on YOUR life. And it is outside the scope of the question asked. I'm fairly certain everyone nowadays is well aware of what smoking can do to your body. You don't have to like smoking or think it's okay but that doesn't make her an AH for doing it.

People who do not smoke who are exposed to secondhand smoke, even for a short time, can suffer harmful health effects.\n\nIn adults who do not smoke, secondhand smoke exposure can cause coronary heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, and other diseases. It can also result in premature death.\n\nSecondhand smoke can cause adverse reproductive health effects in women, including low birth weight.\n\nIn children, secondhand smoke exposure can cause respiratory infections, ear infections, and asthma attacks. In babies, secondhand smoke can cause sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nSince 1964, about 2,500,000 people who did not smoke died from health problems caused by secondhand smoke exposure.\n\nThe effects of secondhand smoke exposure on the body are immediate. Secondhand smoke exposure can produce harmful inflammatory and respiratory effects within 60 minutes of exposure which can last for at least three hours after exposure.\u201d\n\ne: Just before someone else brings it up bc yeah it\u2019s a pet peeve of mine too believe me: under new understanding of SIDS (SUDI in the Australian article), second/third-hand smoke wouldn\u2019t be considered part of that statistic but as far as I\u2019ve seen it hasn\u2019t been retroactively applied and I honestly don\u2019t know if the new standards are being applied to current statistics. The death would be due to the smoke + not SIDS but MEs often like to mitigate parental guilt by classifying it as sudden instead of accidental so I can\u2019t speak for the accuracy of that.

Babies and children are more at risk from these chemicals because they have smaller airways than grown-ups, and their airways are still developing. Also, babies and children have less mature immune systems than grown-ups.\n\nBabies and young children also spend a lot of time on or near the floor and often put their hands and toys into their mouths. This means they can swallow or breathe in harmful chemicals from third-hand smoke or vapour on the floor and other surfaces.\n\nSecond-hand and third-hand smoke\nThere\u2019s clear evidence that children exposed to second-hand smoke are at an increased risk of early death and disease from various causes.\n\nSecond-hand smoke can harm a baby\u2019s breathing, heart rate and growth, which can put the baby at a higher risk of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI). If parents smoke during pregnancy and after their baby is born, their baby\u2019s SUDI risk increases.\n\nIf children are exposed to second-hand smoke, they can have swelling and irritation in their airways.

Even though it involves another being, ultimately its their body and life as well", "You can't really think someone has to give their wanted baby away because they couldn't access abortion", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Europe anyone?!", "Hmmmm, that sounds made up.", "And yet, children still go to bed hungry, live in homeless shelters or cars, and have non-potable water, often contaminated with lead or forever chemicals (PFCs)", "The whole system is broken. I don't think parents should get preferential treatment; *no one* should be without safe housing, or food, or water. Yes even addicts and criminals and ya know, assholes, they still have human rights", "You are right in the ideal world. \n\nUnfortunately there are a number of things that should be given up for a safer and healthier life , alcohol comes to mind , and aren't.", "Damn Right!", ">\u201cIt\u2019s too strict to require people to buckle kids into car seats and wear seat belts every time you drive.\u201d Literally what you sound like.  \n>  \n>From the CDC:  \n>  \n>\u201cThere is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. People who do not smoke who are exposed to secondhand smoke, even for a short time, can suffer harmful health effects.\n\nAgain, someone arguing that second-hand smoke is harmful.  I AGREE.  But now that that's settled, it is a red herring.  Baby isn't in danger of being subjected to second hand smoke.\n\nAnd it was hilarious to read your comment about seat belts and child seats.  I'm old as dirt.  The first time I wore a seat belt of any kind I was about 10 years old.  Some of the cars I rode in as a child weren't even equipped with seat belts.  Later, lap belts were common.  But even then most people didn't use them, and shoulder straps (3-point)  belts came out much later.  Even THEN most people didn't use them.  Child seats were available,  but only in one size (infant) and it was more common for kids that old to sit in a parent's lap...or an older sibling's lap.  My butt never sat in a child's seat of any kind.\n\nI'm not saying seat belts are a bad  idea.  Clearly, they save lives.  But I do think  it's too strict to have laws that enforce (with CIVIL AND CRIMINAL penalties) laws that should be common sense.  For example, when I would ride my motorcycle I was always in full gear.  Full face helmet, riding boots, riding gloves, chaps, armored jacket....\n\nAnd I lived in a state where not even the helmet was mandatory, per the local or state laws.  And that's the way it should be.\n\nTo demonstrate the harm of these nanny laws....\n\nBy 2000, I was in the habit of always wearing a seat belt.  By then, it was common for cars to have 3-point restraints, and it was common for most areas to mandate their use by law.  So it became a habit for me.  I ALWAYS wore one.  Then one day I was hauling my trash to the trash collection site, way out in the country (literally surrounded by dairy farms).  We lived in an area with no trash collection, so we literally threw our garbage  in the trunk (or the back of the pickup) and hauled it away ourself.  IN the middle of fricking NOWHERE, with me being literally the only car on the road for miles....\n\nI see a statie trying to hide under a tree, probably looking for speeders.  I think nothing of it, as I am not speeding.  To my surprise, he pulls out behind me with the disco lights on.  Crap.\n\nSo I pull over (duh).  State police walks to the side of my car and asks me if I know why he pulled me over.  I answered honestly  that I had NO IDEA why he pulled me over.  Then he tells me that I'm not wearing my seat belt. \n\nAnd I realized...OH SHIT!!!  This was literally the only time in several years that I somehow forgot to put it on.  Which was why I assumed the guy had no reason to pull me over.  Because I always wore my seat belt and stayed pretty close to posted speed limits and wouldn't violate any other driving laws....\n\nI got a $200 ticket for that.  I won't say I didn't deserve the ticket.  I was guilty of (at that time) operating a vehicle without wearing my seat belt.\n\nHOWEVER, in the bigger scheme of things, what did it help to fine me $200?  It made  my wallet a little lighter but it literally had NO effect on traffic safety.  None. Zero zip zilch nada.\n\nIf the statie had just reminded me to put my seat belt on, it would have had the exact same effect on traffic safety.\n\nAnd for that reason, I do not agree with nanny laws.  \n\nIf I hadn't been pulled over, I would have realized my mistake as soon  as I arrived at the garbage collection site.  Because my first instinct after parking the car would have been to REMOVE my seat belt.  And then I would have been confused, wondering how I forgot, when I always wear it by habit?", "I agreed with your comment. Maybe it was phrased poorly in my point but i was saying does painting the walls purple lead to an increased chance of the baby dying of SIDS. Basically your same comment but pointing out that cigarettes can cause cancer and increase aids risk vs painting the walls purple.", "Certainly.\n\nI am pro choice, whatever that choice is.\n\nBut you have to admit that sometimes keeping the child is the wrong choice.", "Of course not!\n\nI was talking about \"oops\" babies that the parents can't afford to raise, or maybe don't feel ready for, or just don't want.\n\nBabies that they would have aborted if that were an option for them.\n\nETA: Also, if the baby was wanted, why would it matter that abortion wasn't an option? That makes no sense.", "Eh, the \"compromise\" when heartless conservatives are gutting welfare systems is to still offer some help to families and/or children. Some states make it basically impossible for adults to get Medicaid but sign up all the poor children. However I would argue that the group that gets the most \"handouts\" (beside the billionaires who don't really pay taxes) is actually seniors, between social security and Medicare on top of other programs", "How is it made up when I made too much money to get on any assistance but not enough to feed myself. While if I had a kid I could get food stamps and wic. There are plenty resources provided by the government to help parents who are struggling.", "I agree it\u2019s fucked people suffer, but I personally don\u2019t see how we could ever get to what you\u2019re proposing.", "That is the laziest argument possible and completely irrelevant in a sub where the whole point is passing moral judgement.", "In the uk they would have been able to apply for emergency housing they would never leave a pregnant woman homeless do they have any provision to assist ppl facing hardship", "This is a wall of text that wasn\u2019t worth finishing after you admitted that my goofy call-out was true. Enjoy the rest of your night, we\u2019re both too stubborn to finish this.", "Yes.  There is housing assistance, low cost housing projects (income based eligibility)  You can apply for various programs to pay for groceries, fuel/heat, electricity, MEDICAL insurance.  Anything you need.  The problem is, all those programs are run by government agencies with typical government efficiency.  So if someone other than the government doesn't step in to help the family, they could be homeless and hungry for years  waiting for help."]}
