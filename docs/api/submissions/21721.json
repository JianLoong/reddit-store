Its you body and your choice.", "NTA. These are two grown adults who decided to have a baby. It's not your fault that they apparently did so irresponsibly without the means to care for that child.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, you absolutely should try and quit smoking for your own good and your family's, but you're NTA for refusing to change your lifestyle just so your adult kids can raise a baby in your home.", "I'll say YTA only because 2nd hand smoke is absolutely harmful to humans, especially babies. I have adult asthma because my father smoked my entire life and in the 80s and 90s no one knew about the dangers of 2nd hand smoke. \n\nBut 3rd hand smoke is real too. You wouldn't know because smokers get \"nose blind\" I never smelled smoke on my clothes as a kid but I found out that I indeed reeked of smoke despite taking normal showers and washing my clothes regularly. I didn't even notice that at my parents home until I had move out and had gone there after having not lived there. It reeked and immediately hurt my breathing and burned my eyes. \n\nThis is why they expect you to stop smoking. The smoke/nicotine sticks to your clothing. So, if you're watching the baby, and you go into the garage to smoke, then come back, it's all over your clothes. So when you hold or play with the baby, they are breathing it in.\n\nI know you don't believe it. Smokers never believe their habit hurts anyone but themselves, but you're wrong.

Especially having the nerve to go spinning some sob story to everyone to get them mad at you.\n\nTo add on to this ignore everyone saying YTA for just not quitting smoking. As a former smoker myself who quit a few years back they are out of their minds suggesting someone quit cold who has been a daily smoker for that many years. Withdrawal can and does kill people. OP isn't an AH for smoking either. It's her body. It has no bearing on YOUR life. And it is outside the scope of the question asked. I'm fairly certain everyone nowadays is well aware of what smoking can do to your body. You don't have to like smoking or think it's okay but that doesn't make her an AH for doing it. And it certainly doesn't make her an AH in response to this specific question that was asked. Smoking is bad. We all get it. We know it. We are adults who can make our own informed decisions. Stick to answering the question given the context given.\n\nThis is why you don't come to reddit for advice.\n\nIf you ever want to quit taper yourself off until you can safely stop without issue and getting seriously ill.

Not that there's no risk, but...\n\nIf agencies are disqualifying applicants just for smoking, then it seems the agencies are being a bit too strict on their qualification standards.  And I agree with that, as being too strict would be better than not strict enough.\n\nBut it still wouldn't be enough to prove that someone is a bad nanny just because they smoke.  It would only prove that some employers might round file their application.", "And in another reply she says the garage area they will be using to smoke is a detached garage. So yeah NTA", "Right.", "They aren\u2019t bad at all and that is their choice. They are bad for being mad at OP for her choice", "I get it but first times mums are anxious and risk adverse. I thought like you, i took my newborn to see a friend and she mentioned her child wasn\u2019t feeling well I went anyway and bam I was in hospital for two weeks with him, viral meningitis. I assumed it would be fine because from my experience already having two children it was never a problem. I know what I did was stupid and it\u2019s not really the equivalent viruses vs smoke but i do understand why a new mum would not wanna make the compromise. She\u2019s probably read about SIDS and is sick to her stomach just thinking about it. I was I used to wake up to check if they were breathing several times a night.", "\u201cIt\u2019s too strict to require people to buckle kids into car seats and wear seat belts *every* time you drive.\u201d Literally what you sound like. \n\nFrom the CDC: \n\n\u201cThere is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. People who do not smoke who are exposed to secondhand smoke, even for a short time, can suffer harmful health effects.\n\nIn adults who do not smoke, secondhand smoke exposure can cause coronary heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, and other diseases. It can also result in premature death.\n\nSecondhand smoke can cause adverse reproductive health effects in women, including low birth weight.\n\nIn children, secondhand smoke exposure can cause respiratory infections, ear infections, and asthma attacks. In babies, secondhand smoke can cause sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nSince 1964, about 2,500,000 people who did not smoke died from health problems caused by secondhand smoke exposure.\n\nThe effects of secondhand smoke exposure on the body are immediate. Secondhand smoke exposure can produce harmful inflammatory and respiratory effects within 60 minutes of exposure which can last for at least three hours after exposure.\u201d", "Additional [source](https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/health-daily-care/health-concerns/second-hand-smoke), Australian this time:\n\n\u201cSecond-hand and third-hand smoke and vapour are dangerous, especially for babies and children.\n\nThis is because second-hand and third-hand smoke and vapour can contain harmful chemicals. Babies and children are more at risk from these chemicals because they have smaller airways than grown-ups, and their airways are still developing. Also, babies and children have less mature immune systems than grown-ups.\n\nBabies and young children also spend a lot of time on or near the floor and often put their hands and toys into their mouths. This means they can swallow or breathe in harmful chemicals from third-hand smoke or vapour on the floor and other surfaces.\n\nSecond-hand and third-hand smoke\nThere\u2019s clear evidence that children exposed to second-hand smoke are at an increased risk of early death and disease from various causes.\n\nSecond-hand smoke can harm a baby\u2019s breathing, heart rate and growth, which can put the baby at a higher risk of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI). If parents smoke during pregnancy and after their baby is born, their baby\u2019s SUDI risk increases.\n\nIf children are exposed to second-hand smoke, they can have swelling and irritation in their airways. They\u2019re more likely than other children to develop a range of lung and other health problems.\u201d", "I mean I would be mad if my parent chose smoking over seeing their grandkid but I also don't see in the post where they said they were mad.", ">I get it but first times mums are anxious and risk adverse.\n\nNot enough to risk ending up homeless, apparently.", "The language is obnoxious but it had more links to additional studies than the other articles I found from a two-second Google of \u201cbabies and second-hand smoke.\u201d I have also had to sit through an hour\u2019s worth of drug safety- including cigarettes!- lessons every year when I get re-CPR certified and it\u2019s *always* mentioned. Don\u2019t smoke and touch a baby.", "The last line of the post reeks of entitlement. Accusing them of setting you up to fail when you are having a kid that you don\u2019t have the means to care for is somehow their fault. \n\nAlso, \u201cMom I\u2019m so mad at you for not changing your life to allow us to live rent free and babysit our kid for free.
