It was not an amicable breakup.\n\nFor background, we were together for almost 4 years, engaged for 6 months. I postponed are wedding for several reasons. I was going back to school for my MBA while still working full-time and I felt like I was getting no help at home. I had discussed with ex about him taking over the majority of the chores since I was going to be doing school full-time on top of working. He also worked full-time. He agreed to doing more things at home. That never happened. So over the course of a year, my mental health deteriorated and all my ex would say was \"Idk how to help you\" even though I was asking him to clean dishes or make food for us. \n\nSo, before the downfall, we clearly planned on getting married and spending our lives together. We bought an SUV together. We live in a wintery climate and both had little commuter cars. We wanted a 4-wheel drive vehicle for the winters. His car was newer and mine was 20 years old with almost 200k miles on it. So when it started puttering out, we figured we'd get an SUV and it would be my main vehicle (I did WFH) and in the winter we'd share and play it by ear for who needs it.\n\nBreakup happens. Both names are still on the vehicle. I can't change the title without his notorized signature. I inform him of that. A month passes. Nothing happens. I pay $12 to request a change of title and drop the paperwork off at his job. Nothing happens again. I made the car payments and insurance, even when we were together. Because it was my vehicle. I can't do anything with this vehicle, like refinance, sell, or anything without his signature. \n\nI wanted to refinance because his credit dropped the year after we broke up and the bank was going to raise my interest rate over it. It was 5.5% and they were going to raise it to 6.9% because of HIS credit. I was going to have my mom resign with me and lower my rate to 4.5%! Nothing could be done unless he signed. \n\nIt'd been 10 months at this point. I went to his job with more paperwork I paid for. He didn't work there anymore. I tried contacting his mom. She said \"He's moved on from you.\" And I was like \"Great. I can't move on without him signing this paper.\" 3 weeks passed and nothing. \n\nSo I got a cheap lawyer, who turned out to be amazing, and ended up suing him for $20k (half the cost of the vehicle) and another $50k for time and emotional damage. I won and I still have my SUV in just MY name now.\n\nI feel proud of myself, but friends and family have said I was being vindictive. I originally just sued to compel him to sign the paperwork, but I was onboard with getting money from it so I went for it.

A judgement is useless unless you can collect.", "NTA for the first 20k\n\n 50k for time and emotional damage is way too excessive in my opinion and I can absolutely understand people saying you ruined his life, because you did. He lost 70k\n \nI do believe the extra 50k was done to try and punish him and not because of time and emotional damage. You are entitled to do it and suing for 20k is fine by me. But I would not be surprised if you lose friends over it and I would hope that people would choose him over you if they had to because as they nicely pointed out to you. You ruined his life.\n\nYou yourself even mentioned that all you wanted was his money and so 'emotional damage and time' where just an excuse to try it. You are borderline E-S-H for me because you were petty about it. \n\nI have to ask you though, why do you feel proud about ruining his life because you 'were on board about getting money'? It sounds to me you never intended for the 50k but decided you wanted it and wanted to punish him", "Thank You! I get a goofy smile every time I see my title with just MY name on it \ud83d\ude02", "Thank You! I know I didn't have to pursue that money, but I felt like I was owed it. I never would have bought an expensive vehicle like that if I was living on my own.

I wanted to move on too, but couldn't because of this. The breaking point for me was when he acted like it was a shock that he still had a vehicle in his name! It shows up on your credit and he knew he didn't sign it over. In hindsight he did gaslight a lot with the \"That never happened\" or \"You didn't say that\". That's probably why I kept all my payment records to show I 100% paid for it. \ud83d\ude2c", "Omg, the \"He's moved on from you.\" Like ma'am, nobody is interested taking over parenting duties Mr king baby, that is fully a you problem.", "I love that!

The second time I asked for him and they said he didn't work there anymore. I also text him and his family multiple times and got responses of some sort from them so they were aware.

Don't you think my life was made more difficult when my car payments increased because of HIS actions and responsibility? I had to pay MORE money than necessary on a car payment for over a year until this was fully settled. I had to pay for gas to drive over 2 hours away to his place of work, to the county it was originally registered in, and to the courthouse of the county it was originally restored in on 9 separate occasions. Not to mention the document, court, and lawyer fees I had to pay out of pocket just to get this settled. \n\nAnd if people choose him then they're not people I want in my life anyway.

If your ex was struggling, all he had to do was call you back. Maybe he'll learn to be more responsible from. Or, he'll blame other people for his misery. Doesn't matter know though! Not your problem.", "Oh well then, he fucked around and found it. Totally not your fault. He was willing to ruin your life but refusing to sign it. Let go of that guilt, you have nothing to feel bad about.", "I felt bad during the whole ordeal because I was burdening my parents over this. It took a lot of healing to reach the \"F him\" point because I was trying to be considerate, but he was making my life harder so why should I care about his?
