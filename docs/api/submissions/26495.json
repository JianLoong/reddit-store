He is a regular at my work, I see him shopping about and I often see him when I ride the bus. When he comes into my work, a pot shop (Legal), and he is often grumpy and has a short temper. \n\nHe normally walks in, walks past every customer in line and barks orders to me, gives no advice into what he wants and demands I open all of his packaging as his one arm doesn't work. I would be more inclined to do this if he wasn't a complete ass, everytime.\n\nWhen I see him on the bus, he sits in the first seat and blocks the isle as much as possible then yells at passengers that need by. I've seen him in many yelling arguments on the bus, it's a common accurance. \n\nTonight, he came into my work and the usual he was aggressive and demanding. When I finished up for the night I ran to the bus and sure enough he was sitting there with the whole isle blocked, I said excuse me please and he barked at me to squeeze thru the bars, impossible with my backpack on. I asked him to move it a little so I could squeeze by, then mentioned this is walked folds, he yelled back \"I can't fold it I HAVE ONE ARM\" I thought to myself okay, fair, but it still folds. \n\nWe were approaching my stop, and he asked the bus driver to stop before the lights, as opposed to after the lights were the stop is. The driver went through the lights and stopped at the proper stop, he got up and cussed at the driver and got out the front as I got out the rear. \n\nI yelled over to him \"You know people would be nicer to you if you weren't such a grumpy ass all the time! I see you yelling at people all the time, It doesn't take two arms to be kind, and a little bit of kindness would go a long way for you!\"\n \nI just felt like I needed to be the one to tell him, am I the asshole?\n\n\nEDIT 1\n\nA bit of clarification, I've personally had a rough life, and although I am physically able, I can 100% understand his perspective. I've spent time wheelchair bound, and I've had several traumatic events in my life where I get that you do not know what people are going through. I don't expect the world to owe me anything, and I absolutely go out of my way for people in need. I'm the first person to offer my seat or hold the door. This doesn't make me an angel, by no means. \n\nI personally feel that if you have the means to help, you should. I don't expect anything from this Man, infact it is I who owe him, because that's how I'd like to be treated if I were in his shoes. \n\nHowever, I've seen him yell at Mothers, Elderly, Young, everytime I bite my tongue, until tonight I couldn't hold it in. \n\nI know my words won't change how he is, but I couldn't watch him cuss out the driver without saying something. I know I probably should have kept my mouth shut again, as it doesn't help any, but after a long night, I couldn't this time", "created_utc": 1694230664, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16dv7z1/aita_i_yelled_at_a_handicapped_man_on_the_bus_and/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not sure how that affects his mobility unless he's walking on his hands, and you didn't say that he was. \nPersonally, I find it annoying when people who are handicap want even more concessions made for them. I get it, having mobility issues can make it difficult to get around at times, I know I've had MS for over 20 years now.

You could have just said \"I understand you have difficulties many of us don't have, but you can be kinder.\" Instead you specifically called out his missing arm. (And before you say \"oh, but he had just mentioned it with regards to the walker!\" Yeah. He mentioned his disability *when it was relevant*, because it was an impacting factor that prevented him from folding the walker, which you just expected him to do, you yourself never having had such impairments or having tried to fold a walker on a bus with one arm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get that this guy is rude, and if you really wanted him to be nicer, you could have talked to him like a person. But you just wanted to feel superior, which is why you're here posting about it and saying stuff like \"but it still folds!\" Come on. \n\nThis man lives with difficulties you can't imagine. The world is incredibly hostile to disabled people, and you just piled onto that.", "yes, but at least you know in not getting what you want how he himself feels wherever he goes, angry. which is what he wanted. and yet you didn't do what you yelled he needed to do. apologize next time on the bus. ask him if you may take him to lunch sometime the week following. you might find it all becomes more interesting if nothing else. and he might be less of an asshole when he comes into your store. it is always amazing to me what breaking bread with someone can achieve. anyway, thanks for sharing, from one asshole to another. ;o)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe he might change after. Please send update.", "Sounds like he may be in pain or have some other chronic issues. When people feel worthless or have constant physical issues, it's nearly impossible to be pleasant. \n\nOTOH, he could just be an AH.\n\nYou can say \"if you like, I can help you with that\". But don't be surprised if he doesn't react well. It's not really you.\n\nUnless you scream at him frequently, you're allowed to be frustrated.

I wasn't one of the counsellors, but I did often have free time and would join groups doing whatever.  Most of the guests we had were great. \n\nBut... one thing I learned from the experience is that disabled people can be AHs too.  People who have decided that being disabled grants them an exemption from having to behave like a decent human being.  Like the guy you yelled at. \n\nThere is one thing though... why is it so difficult for you to take off your backpack on the bus?  Doing so results in you taking up a lot less space, makes it easier for you to get through the (sometimes tight) aisles, and easier for others to get past you.  You might have had a lot less difficulty getting past this guy if you had just... taken off your backpack.  Refusing to do so makes you a bit of an AH.  \n\n\nHowever, that said, in this story you are NTA.  Just an AH.", "Thank you, I appreciate your take on this", "That's exactly my feelings! I'd love to help this man more, but he doesn't give much reason or chance to. My co-workers are female and are legitimately scared of serving him due to his hostility.", "To me, his only disability was his inability to be kind. \n\nMy favorite customer at our work is wheelchair bound. She is the nicest lady in the 6 I'd do anything to help her. I really wish he saw how much his attitude was affecting his daily life.", "Having difficulties doesn't mean you need to take it out on the world. People go through bad things in their life everyday, this is why I get so bothered when he yells at everyone indiscriminately.

I'm hourly... I can't afford that many lunches, I just said I'm taking the bus home and now I gotta buy everyone food? \n\nOh, I know!

My judgement was ESH. I'm just saying there's a reason he's so angry and your treatment toward him added to it, instead of being net neutral or mitigating it. \n\n>buying him a sandwich wouldn't have helped any\n\nI also didn't say that. I was advocating for compassion and understanding, which your original post and this comment both indicate that you are lacking in this situation. You think your annoyance at him supersedes his enormous difficulties, and I'm not here to tell you what to think, I'm here to tell you why I think you're both assholes in this situation.

Granted, I could get to know him, then he wouldn't be a stranger, but again there are far more deserving people who really need help and I'd much rather give any energy I have to give to those who earn it. \n\nOriginally, I was very nice to him when he would come in, but his short sharp responses make it hard to hold any sort of conversation.\n\nOver time, seeing him yell at others on the bus, also people who are in need, it really made it hard for me.\nI definitely overreacted today, and that's why I do feel bad and can agree with your ESH, it's hard to feel like me the average person could have been expected to do more. \n\nNot trying to change your mind, and I really appreciate the effort you put into your response, hope you get some good karma your way u/noodles3698", "You mean to respond to the person I responded to?
