Your husband either  does not trust you or is controlling", "YWNBTA. On work trips it is expected that the activities are often connected with work - networking, having dinners with partners and other things like that. If you have to give presentations or attend work meetings it involves a lot of time working in your hotel in the evening, something that a person traveling with you will definitely not be happy about. \n\nMaybe talk with your husband why he feels he NEEDS to come to every single one? Can your family budget allow this - not only for the childcare, but that he books a ticket to travel everywhere with you?", "Absolutely NTA\n\nThat would also mean some problems for your job. You would either not be rested enough or not networking enough\n\nBoth H and I travel semi-frequently for work. Always international. We only have the 1 kid. Whoever travels, travels 'alone'. There was one time when my work trip that was supposed to be 15 days long got extended to 2 months, in Orlando. Once we got that information, H and kid did come to stay a week with me. But that was extremely specific. They would go to the parks daily while I went to work, and we would meet after dinner. Really, they just enjoyed the paid-for accomodations, since we barely met.", "NTA - }they are work trips, so you will have to work. Just tell him he can be in some trips, but not in every trip", "Normal for business trips to locations the couple is interested in is that the spouse who job requires the trip goes on the work part of the trip themselves, then the other spouse flies in later to extend the trip in that location with the couple picking up the hotel cost for the extra days.\n\nNot normal for business trips is someone bringing their spouse for the entirety of a work trip. There may be a need to go out to dinner with clients or associates from other work locations you don\u2019t often see, and a spouse shouldn\u2019t be part of any of that. In addition, the company may have an issue with liability because now the spouse is \u201cconnected\u201d to the work trip and their actions might put the company at risk.", "NTA. From your comments below, it sounds like your husband is sexist and selfish. He doesn\u2019t bring you on all of his trips, so why should he get to come on yours??", "You won't have time for him.  You will be working, preparing for work the following day, working while eating, networking or sleeping.  \n\nI wouldn't want him there.  And if he did tag along, he it wouldn't be long before he was complaining that you weren't spending any time with him - duh it's a work trip, not a social.\n\nAlternatively he's jealous or trying to sabotage your job.", "1. Do you get to tag along on his trips?\n2. If he can't come or can't get time off, is he expecting you to not go?", "NTA. He should look forward to having some time with the kids.", "Ummm... NTA and this is really an odd and unprofessional   insistence on his part.", "NTA.  A work trip is not a vacation.  You will have things to do not only all day but in the evening.  You will be spending time in the evening preparing for the next day.\n\nWork trips are well more work than a typical work week.\n\nTell him that you need to plan a vacation soon, just for you, but that a work trip is not a vacation.", "NTA. Tell him \u201cI will be going on my work trips alone, just as you do.\u201d", "YWNBTA. These are work trips, not \"for fun\" trips and it sounds like your husband is either A: Extremely jealous and controlling and worried you'll do something with a client when he's not there or B: Ignorant of the fact that he is creating more stress for you by expecting you to take time for him on a work trip when you could/should be networking with clients and consultants. \n\nEither way, it's not OK. Once in a while is fine, but expecting to come along on every 2-3 day trip is really out there and excessive.", "NTA. It\u2019s work, not a vacation. Quite frankly this is coming across as possessive and controlling, like he\u2019s afraid of what you\u2019ll do if he\u2019s not there to \u201cwatch\u201d you.", "NTA. A work trip is not a vacation, and it would be unfair to you to have to be working while your husband is relaxing. You also can't be expected to ditch work functions to hang out with him. Many conferences have expectations that the attendees are attending sessions or networking events basically all day.", "NTA - in fact normally it is not permitted.\nWhen I travelled for work it was expected we would network outside of business meetings", "NTA, these are work trips, not little jaunts or vacays he can tag along to. Once in a while maybe but no, not all the time. He'd be wanting to do other things and probably rag on you about having to work.", "NTA\n\nThat is an unreasonable expectation. Should you go on a trip that allows for extra time that is one thing but as a rule, that makes no sense. Even in terms of just being a parent - not really reasonable that both parents leave each time either.", "NTA.  If he travels with you, who would be watching the kids? Or are they going too??  \nA work trip, paid for by the company isn't a vacation.", "NTA. It's not appropriate for him to come with you on work trips. Plus, these are not vacations - you will be working.", "NTA Your husband tagging along will negatively impact your ability to connect with your coworkers outside of work. Work trips almost always include dinners / social outings. He\u2019ll also most likely bug you while you\u2019re at work because he\u2019s bored at the hotel. He needs to let you have your time away while working.", "The answer is \"no\". Full stop. It is a work trip. \nNTA", "YWNBTA. You say you both travel for work. How would he feel if you insisted on going on every one or HIS work trips??", "YWNBTA. Good rule of thumb is that unless your boss says \"feel free to include SO\" on the trip, that answer is a big fat no. You're going on that trip to work, not to have fun with your husband on company time.", "NTA. I think your husband is being unreasonable. Why does he want to come with? To me it sounds controlling. When I was working, I traveled for work frequently. My husband wouldn't have dreamed of tagging along. I mean, it is not what people do.", "NTA, it's work and it's unprofessional to let your husband to tag along. Your work deserves respect, not to be viewed as a holiday opportunity and I really hope he doesn't want to come because he wants to keep an eye on you.", "NTA. You\u2019re there to work and socialize/network for your career, not babysit your insecure husband.", "NTA - youre working. This is giving me controlling vibes, and this flag is looking quite red.", "NTA, your company is paying for you to travel so that you can work. Adding this pressure on you is selfish and inappropriate.", "NTA. I used to travel a lot for business and no-one ever brought their partner. It would be hella weird. Plus, business trips often mean working extra long hours, so no-one wants a needy spouse there.", "NTA. You are traveling for work and have no responsibility to \"make time\" for him.", "NTA it sounds like he\u2019s lowkey trying to sabotage your job", "NTA. I would explain to him, that since it is a new job you need to see how much time you will have available to spend with him and it might not be worth it for him to come along.", "NTA\n\nComing once in a while should be okay.\n\nWarning:  The Reddit brigade will be calling your husband controlling for daring to want to come with you.", "Thats a complicated question, because you no wanting him along might raise the wrong flags.\nI dont know your exact relationship so its hard to say.", "Perhaps he is just longing for a short get a way without the kids, time for just the two of you away from home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He didn't last long either. You can either tell your husband no or tell him that from now on you'll be accompanying him on all his trips if that's how things will be.
