There may be a need to go out to dinner with clients or associates from other work locations you don\u2019t often see, and a spouse shouldn\u2019t be part of any of that. In addition, the company may have an issue with liability because now the spouse is \u201cconnected\u201d to the work trip and their actions might put the company at risk.", "NTA.

Don\u2019t let it become expected and the norm. \n\nCongratulations on surviving maternity and good luck with returning to work.", "Disney World and Hershey Park were literally the only places we ever joined my dad on a business trip and those events were extremely rare. He traveled every week for work and I can probably count on one hand how many times we went with him. I can't imagine anyone expecting to go every time! Definitely concerning.", "Tagging along with your SO on a trip is not unusual and is very reasonable. You get to capitalize on free roam & board and transportation, and go on a mini trip. \n\nYou just need to understand that your partner is on the clock and not responsible for your entertainment. Your time with them will be limited, and you should have no expectation of spending time with them. Stay out of their way and allow them to accomplish the purpose of the trip. \n\nWanting to come along isn't inherently jealous or sabotaging. This OP's husband isn't approaching this in the right way, so I think think OP WNBTA. But let's not pretend that wanting to tag along on a work trip is weird.", "Makes me wonder what he's doing on his business trips if he's so concerned about following along for every one of OP's.", "Yes he is actually on a week long work trip right now with training the whole entirety of the trip, but he still insists that I could have tagged along. Not sure where his mindset is and he just refuses to give me any other reason why it is this way.", "He says he would like me to come with him occasionally, but we haven't actually gone through with it yet. I have spoken with him about the trips and that it may not work this time around, lets plan for a different trip. His response was that he is still going regardless of what I am saying. That he has the right to go as well.", "He would like to take advantage of the free hotel room and explore a new city that he hasn't seen before. There's also the added bonus of some quality time (if I have any).", "She said she was OK with a trip here and there.  The thing is, he insists on going with her to every work trip she'll be doing. Every one of them. That is a very weird demande and he refuses to elaborate.", "Why wouldn't he be the one to stay and mind the kids? Makes zero sense", "Do you want to be fired or be look down by your bosses? Its so unprofessional to bring your partner to business trips unless after the trip you stay and he can tag along", "Why is he not home watching his children?", "I'd say if he wanted to go on the rare trip to somewhere special that would make sense. My mom, sister, and I tagged along on my dad's trips to big trade shows when they were centered around amusement parks but 99% of the time they weren't anywhere particularly special and we didn't go. Throughout my entire childhood I can probably count on one hand how many times we went and again, only for things like Disney World, not a business meeting in Detroit or St. Louis. \n\nOP's husband expecting to go EVERY time is where it starts looking suspicious. Does OP go with him every time he has a business trip? I highly doubt it. Inaisting on joining her every time looks more like being controlling than a loving partner wanting to spend time together.", "Saying he wants to come on every trip and that OP needs to spend time with him is why ppl r saying it\u2019s motivated by something else.\nWhat you\u2019re saying is reasonable, but husband isn\u2019t saying that.", "It's grossly unprofessional, inappropriate and in my industry would be looked down upon. It's completely unheard of here and would actually sabotage your career progression.  Not to mention, it's down right appears pathetic to bring a mooching spouse when you're meant to be doing your role. \n\nAlso, it's not free. The company is paying for the hotel, flights, rental car.", "It's that he wants to go on ALL the trips that makes it weird.", "It's not reasonable if your partner says no.  She might need to concentrate on work when she gets back to the room and it's pretty obvious he's needy and clingy as hell.  How is she supposed to get her work done if he's constantly bugging her?  It's completely reasonable if you are invited but if someone says \"no that's not going to work for me\". that's it.", "Yeah, my husband and I have both tagged along on work trips with one another. The only time I feel bad about it is when my husband goes to somewhere we have family and I tag along. But we also don\u2019t do it every single time. That\u2019s what makes this weird and the fact that her husband expects her to have time for him on these trips is inappropriate. I actually wonder if it\u2019s something to do with getting away from the baby and having some couple time. \n\nNTA OP, but find out why your husband is pushing this, it sounds like he might be having some anxiety over dad duty.", "There has been no infidelity on either part within our entire relationship, and I do trust him fully. Not sure why he wouldn't trust me at this point when I haven't done anything for him to worry.", "You know what I'm going to say, don't you? \n\nHis request is NOT normal. Even before you do anything on the advice of your fellow Redditor, ask your HR/do discovery what their take/policy is on this is. He could be getting you in hot water with your job. \n\nThat's not cool. Worse, if you allow this and work finds out after the fact that you violated company policy. You will get fired or possibly need to reimburse the firm for ALL of the trip expenses due to misuse.\n\nLastly,\n\nRun this past someone who doesn't know you or your husband. I would 100% say that they'll also tell you this is NOT NORMAL. \n\nRedditors are telling you this. Complete strangers. \n\nAnd not normal behavior is a red flag. Yes... we have no clue what your society is like, but dang his request is just an eyebrow lift and a half. \n\nYou're married. Not joined at the hip.", "He can do that on his own, but he has to pay for the flight and hotel , cause your employer paid for yours and he doesn\u2019t have rights hijack your business trip and hotel room .\n\nI\u2019m not going to lye I don\u2019t like this \u2018 I get to control your work trip \u2018 attitude.", "That\u2019s very controlling and strange. He has a right to go and he\u2019s going on your work trip whether you like it or not? This cannot be the first time he\u2019s done something like this?", "If he says \"gee I've always wanted to go to City X\", you say you'll see if you can use the weekend when the business part is over, maybe wrangle a day off/vacation day and hon it'll be fun to explore City X together,  i could use a break after that conference. And clarify that your co. is NOT covering those expenses. \nOtherwise for all the reasons your wise Redditors have expressed about jeopardizing your job, the answer is NO.", "You\u2019re relationship is not \u201cgreat\u201d far from it.", "I wondered about that, too. The husband has no business wanting/needing to go on all these trips.", "Yeah, I agree. Going every time is weird and OP's husband is approaching this in an unusual manner.\n\nIt does depend on the cities though - if she's going to Paris, Tokyo, Athens, etc. I'm going every time. If it's places that aren't desirable, I'm not going.", "If someone's career can be adversely affected because their spouse stayed in their hotel room for a few nights, it's a poor industry. Having a spouse along with you for a few nights has no indication on one's competency or capacity. \n\nThere's no additional cost to the employer in this situation. Obviously the spouse would be paying for their own flights. I question if you even read what was written before you replied.", "I can't really help you understand then, maybe you should just ask him why he doesnt trust you.", "It's absolutely unheard of here, you would be given a talking to on arrival back in the office and would probably not be going to represent the company going forward. It's just so inappropriate, your spouse's career is not a holiday for you.\n\nIt is delusional of you to assume this is the norm in a corporate industry.", "It is not unreasonable for an employer paying for your trip to expect you to be focusing on the job when you are on your trip.", "Who cares what he believes - tell you are not going to put up with his misogyny!", "Just curious, why are you okay with him and his attitudes?", "Well unfortunately I think you've found the source of the problem. He's trying to control you by invading your work trips, possibly to sabotage your career."]}
