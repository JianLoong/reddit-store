Sounds like a gift grab.", "NTA\n\nReading the title, I thought you meant your friend was getting remarried.  The same fiance?  Yeah, you don't get two engagement parties.  Plus you literally hosted their first party.  And they only gave you a short notice.", "NTA.  You already hosted the first one. Enjoy your weekend of not driving two hours round trip for a second party", "NTA and why would anyone have a second celebration for the same event? Did your friend dump the first one, and get engaged to someone else???", "NTA. First engagement party wasn't even necessary. Bro is looking for every opportunity to get people to give him things.", "NTA. Sounds like they just want more gifts or something. You\u2019ve not only attended their first party you hosted it. You\u2019re not obligated to drive 2 hour round trip, seems last minute too, to attend their second party. Stay home and enjoy a quiet weekend!!", "You're very clearly the AH for hosting such a piss poor gathering in the first place that forced then to have another get together to make up for it.\n\nSeriously... NTA.\n\nBonus: since you're now uninvited from the wedding, you won't have to buy them a gift either.", "NTA for not attending but YTA for how you responded. I think it would have been better for everyone if you kept your judgements to yourself and just told them that you couldn't make it. \n\nI agree that a second engagement party is ridiculous, and while you didn't say it in your post (and I don't want to assume this is the case), I could understand if their having a second party hurt your feelings. If I'd already gone to the trouble of hosting an engagement party for my friends and they decided to have another, that would certainly leave me feeling hurt! If this is the case, however, I think it would have been best to bring it up beforehand and explain your feelings.\n\nIf your feelings weren't hurt, feel free to disregard that part\u2014but there are nonetheless better ways to communicate that you won't be able to make it that will do less damage to your friendship and probably leave you all feeling better in the long run.", "You can say no for any reason", "NTA\u2026 but perhaps your response to their question could\u2019ve been approached differently? It\u2019s hard to tell without all the context from this post, but you seem very annoyed, which I\u2019m sure you are. If that annoyance came through in your response to their request, I could see why they\u2019d be disappointed. You\u2019re their friend and clearly an important one if you hosted the first one, they probably just want to spend time with you and were hoping you wanted to spend time with them. I think it\u2019s totally fair to say you\u2019re exhausted from work and need some alone time, but it sounds like some of that may have been lost in translation.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can understand having a second engagement party if their families live really far apart, but since it's only an hour away that seems unlikely.\n\nPlus, they invited you less than a week out? Rude. Andd unrealistic for them to expect you to drop everything for it. Especially after hosting the first.\n\nThat being said, you could have been a bit more diplomatic in your rejection. But it does seem like they caught you off guard, so I'm not judging you too harshly.", "NTA\n\nSounds like they just want presents. There\u2019s no need for a second engagement party. Honestly, I bet there wasn\u2019t a need for a first one either.", "NTA", "NTA. Tell them you'll go to the next one.", "YTA.  You're not the asshole for not wanting to go. You're not even the AH for thinking it's a dumb idea.  YTA for \\**being an unking AH about it*\\*   You very easily could have said \"Sorry, I'm not going to be able to make it, I hope you have a wonderful time.\" and just left it at that. Instead you got verbally judgmental about them having a second party. So what if you think it's a dumb idea, or a gift grab, or a waste of time- t*here was no real reason to say that out loud.*   \n\n\nMaybe they have people they wanted to celebrate with who were out of town, or couldn't make it to the party you threw. Maybe it's a spontaneous thing someone else is throwing. It doesn't matter, you didn't need to be rude. You \\*literally\\* could have kept your \"Yay, move on\" snark to yourself.", "NTA. First thing I thought too. All of the other things that a party did outside of getting gifts was already accomplished. Announced, congratulated and celebrated. What is round 2 going to do differently? Is it different people?", "Same chick. She\u2019s nice sometimes but lately just absolutely exhausting to be around. Always making digs at me for staying single after 10 years of relationships in my twenties. Digs at me for enjoying my single life with my dog and doing whatever the fuck I want. Acts like because I\u2019m single with free time I can comply with every single request of theirs. She wears the pants and I hate watching my friend turn into someone different than the guy I know. Anyways zero motivation to go.", "Thanks for the reply. Definitely not hurt, the first one was a lot of fun and the people who showed up had a great time. It was quite the rager!\n\nAs for the second part, I\u2019ll reply with what I said to another commenter who brought up the same issue:\n\nI should have added - I have to act in such a manner to them otherwise they will not stop hounding me until I snap. They call me together, on speakerphone, and both hound me over and over and over until I either say yes or basically say stop fucking asking me. Drives me nuts. They do this often. \n\nMy theory is she is so used to never being told \u201cno\u201d by my friend that she thinks she can get what she wants with everyone else. So when she encounters someone who won\u2019t bend or comply, she goes bananas.", "I should have added - I have to act in such a manner to them otherwise they will not stop hounding me until I snap.

It's nobody's business to comment on. \n\nAlso enjoy your weekend. You're not obligated to attend any party, let alone 2 for the same engagement. Sounds like they are looking for gifts and money, and attention. The world doesn't revolve around their engagement or wedding. \n\nAsk them how many weddings you are going to be expected to attend for them, too.\n\nNTA", "I'm glad the first one was fun!\n\nAs for them continuing to hound you when you say no\u2014have you told them that this behavior bothers you? You could say something as simple as, \"My answer is still no, and I need you to respect that. I understand that you want me to be there, and that means a lot to me, but I cannot attend.\" \n\nIf they continue to bother you about it, you can say something along the lines of, \"I already told you no. When you don't respect my answer and keep trying to change my mind it makes me feel like you don't respect me.\" \n\nIf you've already been straightforward with them about this issue, however, it may be worth either 1) saying no once and then refusing to pick up the phone if they call again after that or 2) re-evaluating the relationship.", "That's crazy!!", "LOL!!!
