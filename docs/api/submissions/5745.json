NTA. You are not your partner's extended family's shared babysitter! Your partner is TA for not sticking up for you, and his family is totally taking advantage of you! You are NTA!!!", "NTA and it\u2019s okay to find a more respectful partner/relationship", "NTA His whole family are treating you poorly. Don't let him play the victim on this or try make you feel guilty. They're meant to be your holidays too. He shouldn't invite you if you're not welcome to celebrate. You're not a doormat. I think it's a great idea to simply refuse to go. They can hire a babysitter instead. Your boyfriend can still take your own kids if he wants to. You're just opting out of unpaid work over the holidays.", "NTA. In future I'd say something like, \"I looked after the kids yesterday, so whose turn is it today?\" And send him off with the kids if he can't tell you who.", "NTA. Not your kids. Not your problem. That is why people pay babysitter\u2019s, when they want someone to watch THEIR children. It is abusive to you.", "NTA. What rude people. You know your partner is the one that lets this happen. Not going is a good solution.", "NTA, it's not your responsibility to look after other people's children while they get shitty. I mean atleast not as like some unspoken every single time type of thing. Why can't the kids go outside with their parents, because people are smoking weed? Sounds irresponsible to me. If you have kids you need to be responsible for them. Period. I mean, maybe some better communication about what's happening as the days unfold would be helpful, but ya man that sounds annoying as fuck. My nephew is six and he's realllllyyyy hard to handle, even in short bursts. I feel bad because I love the kid and I know he just wants to play, but playing at this point is just him jumping all over me and being insane, it's just too much. And that's just one kid ha. NTA, if people can't have a couple drinks maybe smoke a little even and still keep an eye on their children then they shouldn't be partaking in the festivities. Furthermore, I recognize these parents probably struggle with parenting, as raising kids is exhausting, but if they want a break to unwind then they can find a babysitter they give some money too then get as shitty as they want without it being a problem. Pawning them off on you every chance they get though is pretty low down.", "NTA. \n\nYour partner is being incredibly immature. Although given that he's 24 and you're 30, that unfortunately makes sense. His brain is literally just finishing maturing, and you are significantly ahead of him in emotional and mental development. \n\nYou need to sit down and have a very overdue discussion on respect and treating your partner like a PARTNER instead of hired help. I would honestly try to get him to a couple's therapist for that decision, because it's already clear that he is going to be defensive about the need to grow up and stop treating Christmas like his best chance to be a carefree kid again. He has already minimized the impact this has on you, and shown total disregard for your feelings when you get used and left out. You are going to need the mediator to avoid the conversation devolving into accusations and anger so that you can actually address how disrespected and used you feel. \n\nUntil that happens, don't go back, and don't let any of your kids go. Without you there, it is obvious there will be no responsible sober oversight for the kids.", "Nta\n\nYou are being taken advantage of.  He knows it and doesn't care as he just wants to have fun.\n\nStop going multiple days.", "Honey, you partnered with a child and you are expecting adult behavior.\n\nYou know his family dumps on you. Stop letting them. Do not go back for family events as they clearly don't see you as family. If you do, you're an idiot. Believe people when they show you their truth.\n\nYTA  because you left your kids in a situation where you know the adults are ignoring them. Go rescue your kids and never leave them in that situation again. Then seriously consider if whatever your partner is bringing to this relationship is worth you being treated as free labor for his entire family. He obviously cares more about them than you and whatever thrill he gets from their happiness at your distress.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't tolerate that from him; especially not when my kids were involved.", "NTA- you\u2019re asking for the bare minimum and getting (-) negative results. Run!", "NTA and don\u2019t let him gaslight you by making you feel bad about \u201cnot wanting him to spend time with him family\u201d because you don\u2019t want to babysit a litter of kids. He knows that\u2019s not what you mean and not what is actually happening. He knows it\u2019s wrongly being dumped on you, and he\u2019s trying to gaslight you and make it seem like you\u2019re being irrational for not wanting to be a free bang nanny. Y W B T A if you don\u2019t tell him he needs to either shape up or f*** off", "NTA, you have an extra kid though and it's your partner. You are definitely being used as a babysitter and I would be concerned that he doesn't seem to want to spend time with you as long as he gets to have his fun. Time to let him be a parent. If they try to stick the kids on you again just leave and say it's some other adult's turn", "YTA for leaving your kids in a situation where the adults are drinking, smoking, and ignoring the kids.\n\nGirl you\u2019re 30 why are you with a 24 year old boy? Is he the father to your children? All they do is drink and smoke? The fact he doesn\u2019t understand you not wanting to be the designated babysitter is troubling.\n\nThere is a 6 year age gap and even wider maturity gap.", "Yikes. You\u2019re really being an A Hole to yourself, aren\u2019t you?  Why do you let yourself be treated like shit? I bet bf does this at home too, not just with his family", "NTA.  You're not his partner, you're his asset.  You can do better.  He'll gaslight you if you complain so just leave him a note on your way out.  Or not... He won't believe it anyway.", "NTA\n\nYour husband and his whole family are. They not only don't ask you if you mind babysitting, they don't even tell you that you ARE babysitting until you realize they're gone. It's borderline child abandonment. They're walking all over you, and your husband is participating. I mean, if he wants you to do child duty so he can spend a couple of days with his brother whom he hardly ever sees, that's one thing. But sticking you with all the kids? No. \n\nI would refuse to go ever again, and tell them all why. But don't stay home, because those assholes will come to your house and leave their kids with you. So don't be there.\n\nIf you ever want to visit them again, text everyone ahead of time, on an app that shows when a message has been read, that you will not babysit their children, and that if they leave the children with you, you will call the police for child abandonment. And then follow through. Take a separate car so you don't have to depend on your husband for transportation.", "NTA- Dump this guy and he can be the designated babysitter. I drink and smoke but I always check on my kids, now that they are older I don't have to but I still do. I wonder what would happen if you decided to go outside or on outings even though you don't smoke or drink. Would you be pressured into staying with the kids anyway?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You really need to discuss with the other parents that you cannot be the sitter and that you would love to spend time with the adults too.
