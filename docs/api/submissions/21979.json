They shouldn\u2019t have rented it out for a private group and then expected you to share the space.", "The facility is the AH. They've got no business selling \"all access day\" passes to people and also selling exclusive usage of part of their facilities. Given that you haven't mentioned this, I'm assuming that it's not an area that is clearly marked as not included in an all access day pass at the point of purchase (online or at the entrance).\n\nYou are NTA. The business put both you and the woman in crappy positions.", "NTA.  The company was double dipping.  They can't charge for people to reserve a space and charge for other people to use that space at the same time.  The woman and her child did have every right to be there.  They paid for their access to the course.  THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO PAY FOR A PRODUCT THE COMPANY KNEW IT COULD NOT DELIVER.  NEITHER SHOULD YOUR WORK BE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THEY WON'T DELIVER.  Management should have made it clear to them that all access day pass did not actually mean all access day pass that day, or made it clear to your company that they were just getting all access day passes, but not exclusive use.  If your company bought exclusive use, then they are also paying for the business to position the employees to enable and enforce that.\n\nBoth your work and that women deserve compensation for their sneakiness or bad business practices.", "I usually wait to answer when I feel my take is wrong but fuck it.  \n\n\nNTA.  When you pay to reserve a space, it should be reserved.  I would\u2019ve told the employee to bring the mom and her kids back to finish the course, as long as they refund your reservation fee.", "NTA. It\u2019s always the entitled and their enablers that cause situations like this. Granted, she may not have known that certain sections were reserved when she bought the tickets, but that\u2019s a discussion she should\u2019ve had with the manager. Also, what\u2019s the point of reserving if anyone feeling entitled can just evade the space?", "NTA. Your company paid for it and she didn't, so why would she be allowed to stay?\n\n>The reason I am asking if I (or we) are the asshole is that later, the employee who helped escort the person out said \u201cyou know, she was right. Would it really have hurt to let them stay and finish the course. Your company already paid for it. Were they really bothering you?\u201d\n\nThat was out of line and imo you should have reported them. Who the heck do they think they are lmao.", "NTA.   She could have  gone to management  and asked for her money back  as she didn't have all day access.", "NTA.\n\nIf she paid for an all access pass the staff effed up, probably the one who tried to make you feel guilty. And you should have reported them.\n\nIt was your company\u2019s space to use, not hers. She was an entitled ass.", "NTA. You paid for it to be private. If you wanted to let the family continue to play there, you could choose to do that, but you had no obligation to do so. \n\nI would report that employee's comment to the manager and facility owner.", "You *could* have let mother and children stay. And be underfoot. At a work event.\n\nYay, entitled woman and kids. Underfoot. At a work event.\n\nHere is an idea. You kick her and her kids out and they get to go play somewhere else and woman gets to go complain to somebody else-far away from you- that her \u201call access day pass\u201d clearly wasn\u2019t all access, and maybe she could get a small refund. Or she could be explained to what limits there were to \u201call access\u201d.\n\nBut that was not your problem. NTA", "NTA. \n\nThe fact is, you reserved it.  And the problem isn't if you just let them in, but what about the next group.  You need to be consistent.  \n\nIf the staff member thought they were right, he should have discussed it with his manager. \n\nAt best, this is one of those situations where it could've been resolved better.  Mom could have said \"I didn't know it was reserved.  Would you mind if we played a couple of holes\"", "NTA. There was even a sign up.", "Nta", "NTA- those events were reserved and paid for by the company. Places like this usually have certain things that are extra to the all access passes. One near me allows you to have all the video games and soft play you want but you only get 1 or 2 big things and you have to scan your card to get those, once that's done you can purchase more if you want but if not you just play the games or do the soft play. She probably used her extra and saw the balls and just took it as since no one would know who would it hurt. (at our place they let everyone know when they have places blocked out when they purchase that those are off limits so they probably told her).", "NTA, the business fucked up by selling day passes they couldn't fulfill, and the employee fucked up by giving his unsolicited opinion to paying customers who were in the right.", "NTA.  Your company paid for exclusive use of that course, they didn't pay for that woman and her kids.  Report that employee to their manager because the employee knew the course was reserved and not open to anyone else, including those with the \"all-access pass\".  The employee shouldn't have shamed you.\n\nThe all-access pass granted the woman access to the mini-golf course *before noon or after 3pm.*  She didn't pay for use of the golf course during the time your company reserved, and she knew the course was closed.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
