We were both business students and involved in the business school clubs/organizations so we\u2019d be tapped by the administration for open houses and other events. I\u2019m a white guy, she\u2019s a black woman. On more than one occasion the school admin approached us when we were together and said something like \u201cdreaming tree, can you please lead the open house student panel on internships? {Black girl} can you please lead the panel on financial aid and diversity?\u201d And she\u2019d have to say \u201cmy parents are both dermatologists and I grew up in {fantastically wealthy NYC suburb town in our state}\u201d. At least the admin would clumsily apologize, but she told me this kind of thing happened constantly, her being assumed to have a certain background in a patronizing way. It\u2019s total bullshit.", "I used to be a campus tour guide and students weren't expected to provide financial aid info, they made a representative from that office available to answer questions.", "That girl is a champion for DEI? It\u2019s like asking Will Smith to run an anger management seminar.", "I\u2019m confused because I never heard people assuming black people were recent immigrants before. I live along the Bible Belt with some pretty bad racism, black people are one of the only minority groups that don\u2019t get told to \u201cgo home\u201d, plenty of bad words said but \u201cyou\u2019re not from here\u201d is not one of them. Where the hell would this notion that she\u2019s black so she must be an immigrant come from? How much major history does she have to ignore to not realize black people have been all over the world for hundreds of years?", "\u201cAny reasonable individual\u201d would think I\u2019m FGLI\"_\n\nYup. This individual said in her mind black should automatically be assumed to be poor or disadvantaged in her mind. Report her. She is incapable of performing her duries due to prejudice and ignorance.", ">It's *your* fault that you're not poor. Don't you know that black people are inherently disadvantaged? You should have told me your financial status, a thing I probably didn't ask anyone.\n\n-DEI girl, probably\n\nEdit: apparently if I don't leave a space, balckpeople don't exist but blackpool does.", "\"Who put her in charge\" who know's? But people like OP worrying about being TA if they call her out will explain how she stays there.", "> and your father's background.\n\nBecause everyone knows that being a veteran is a ticket to nowhere?

She assumed something about OP because they\u2019re black. It\u2019s pretty textbook racism.", "The last thing the program needs is stupid folks making racist assumptions in leadership roles.    Report her and do not allow anyone to make excuses for her and the fact that she has any decision making power when it comes to dealing with incoming students.", "So she racially profiled you and then placed the blame on you, because she didn\u2019t get all the facts before making matches\u2026you definitely need to report her.", "Big yikes \ud83d\ude33 \n\nAbsolutely report her. It is beyond unacceptable that someone with her bias is in a position that makes decisions that are supposed to support diversity and inclusion.", "Seriously I could have lead that tour as someone who paid my own way through college & was on every form of aid I could find! I am also from the suburbs and white. I was a first generation college student. NTA and please report her.", "Nope. She\u2019s racist. You told her your defining characteristic (athlete) and she refused to believe it because you are black. Did any other students have to tell her they were \u201cnot FLGI\u2019?\n\nAlso, by her methods some white kids could have been poorly matched since she has such strong beliefs that black skin tones mean FGLI.", "This is horseshoe theory.  She used DEI radically and came out racist, i.e \"You're black, of course you're poor\"\n\nReport this, it's blatant racism.", "I refer to it as \"DIE\" because these programs need to be dead and buried. Sure they sound nice; however, in practice they always turn into what you experienced. People racially profiling you", "Sweet Christ. \n\nI don\u2019t have the words. She\u2019s like the caricature stereotype of the white savior limousine liberal who\u2019ll put a BLM sticker on their car while check-locking their doors of driving by black people walking on the sidewalk.\n\nAnd of course thsts the person when called on their stereotyping tries to gaslight you by claiming *youre* the asshole when *she* made assumptions based on your race. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", ">\u201cDiversity, Equity, Inclusion\u201d push to match \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d college students with \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d high schoolers.\n\nSoooooo, why didn't she **ask** if there were any self-identifying \"disadvantaged\" students who would be comfortable with sharing their experiences with similar high schoolers?\n\nRather, she preferred to make assumptions that are extremely problematic AND racist.\n\nReport her.", "So she told you that she made a racist assumption about you and then was shocked that you called her racist? NTA\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous though that they have a student doing these tour assignments if you aren\u2019t all going to be trained on all the things students are likely to ask about.
