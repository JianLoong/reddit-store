Plain and simple, SHE IS RACIST. There is no other explanation. You have done nothing wrong.", "NTA. Go ahead and report her. The mere fact that she didn't even question her own decision and blames it on you and your appearance is enough. Now, she may not be a dyed-in-the-wool racist or a bad person, she could just have lead a very sheltered life. But in that case she really, really needs an awakening. She needs to be made aware that her outlook on the world may be wrong in a great number of ways.", "NTA. I was on the fence until you got to the part where she said that she made the assumption based on your race. She didn't even have the grace to backtrack when you said you weren't in fact FGLI.

I mean fine ppl judge others all the time no matter if you are thin or thick or small or tall ,it's fucked up because you can't never escape it, ppl will always judge  but the cherry on top was when she said it was your fault because every reasonable individual would think you are FGLI..  I don't know how we stop ppl to judge others but it has to stop . It's her fault to fall into stigma believes its like say women can't repair cars or women are not strong because that what they know to believe when in reality there are tons of women who are stronger than men kicking their butts off in the gym . We need to stop seeing ppl through sterotypes", "NTA. She sounds like the guy that told a black Columbia University professor that he looks like a cocaine dealer in live news.  She is disgusting and racist. There is nothing wrong with being low income and first generation, but there are a lot of things wrong to judge that a person is low income and first generation just by the colour of their skin.

I feel like you buried the lead, lol. \n\nNTA", "NTA and when you have clearly stated that you want to be matched with the student athletes, she could have at least checked before matching you to something else. It appears that in her head all black people have to be somehow poor which is stereotyping and I can understand would make a lot of people upset. People with such biased opinions should never be in charge of anything and you should most definitely report her articulating why it was wrong to assume and the response she had when you asked her.", "She\u2019s racist, report her asap. You are NTA", "Lol. Report her racist ass.

I timidly knocked on his door and he glanced up from his desk for a nanosecond before going back to his work.  First question he asked me was, \"Are you an athlete?\"  \n\nI was speechless.  I'm the clumsiest person I know.  There's nothing \"athletic\" about me...except for my resemblance to a certain racial stereotype.  It was the first time on college campus that I had felt some kind of way about being black.\n\nSome people will think that kind of thing is not worth talking about.  It's not an actual lynching.  No one's throwing out dehumanizing slurs.  But it's still aggressive.  Microaggressive, but aggressive nonetheless.  It is a reminder that people don't see you in three dimensions, but rather a stereotype.    \n\nThe professor, as much of a jerk he was, ended up being one of my favorites.  He was full of microaggressive comments--ones worse than the athlete remark!--but he was an excellent instructor who very quickly recognized my talents and nurtured them.  I say this not to excuse his racist bullshit at all, but to encourage you to keep powering through.  I was able to take advantage of the kindness he showed for me and got hooked up to my current career path.  Try to do the same, sis.
