She\u2019s been living Brussels for the past 4 years and is now moving back to London as she was offered a better position.\n\nShe can move into her new flat in mid February so she asked if she could stay with me and of course, I agreed, I missed her. If course, I refused to accept any rent (she offered).\n\nIt\u2019s been great but one thing I\u2019ve noticed is that my daughter has a habit of ordering online. A lot. She runs out of toothpaste? She won\u2019t bother going to the shop, she\u2019ll just order it online with her other essentials like shampoo. Needs clothes or stuff for her new house? She\u2019ll order it. She even bought her father\u2019s birthday gift and wrapping paper online.  She even has groceries delivered because she insisted she pays for them because she lives rent free. She barely goes to shops and because of people like her our high streets are dying. \n\nIt\u2019s unhealthy and every time for a week now, whenever a package came, I returned it which forced her to shop locally a few times.\n\nBut now, because quite a few packages never arrived, she realised what\u2019s been happening and confronted me and she\u2019s fuming. She accused me of treating her like a child and saying I had no right to return her stuff.\n\nI told her that something had to be done and I tried explaining my point but she told me she\u2019s done, package her stuff and went stay at a hotel, wasting money. I asked her to move back, promised to not do it again b it she\u2019s stubborn and won\u2019t listen. She told me she\u2019ll stay at a hotel until she can move into her flat.\n\nI only wanted to help her but she\u2019s being so unreasonable. My husband stays neutral and I don\u2019t know. Was I the asshole here? Was I wrong for returning those packages.", "created_utc": 1674319561, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hvhbk/aita_for_returning_all_of_my_daughters_packages/", "score": 1284, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No wonder she spent the past few years in an entirely different country from you.", "YTA:  \"I only wanted to help her,\" is a false statement. You wanted her to do things your way and decided to force her to do so because you feel your way is the best way and the only way. It is a control thing with you. She was right to leave. In your mind, you will never be wrong and this is evidenced by calling her unreasonable for her reaction to your treachery.", "YTA you did not want to help her, you wanted to control her. You're getting what you deserve.", "YTA.\n\nThere are a lot of local shops that sell through websites (and are often identified as such), so she may still be supporting \u201cmom & pop\u201d type places. \n\nI order a lot of stuff online - I\u2019m particular about brands I use & the local store is inconsistent in whether they carry what I\u2019m looking for. I also find it incredibly convenient. I\u2019m guessing your daughter does as well & you should not be controlling or manipulating her. If you were concerned about local stores, you could have said to her \u201cI\u2019m concerned about how much online shopping you do. I think it\u2019s important to support local businesses here in our community, would you consider shopping locally, at least while you are staying here?\u201d", "YTA. Something you didn't think about; a lot of people have their medication delivered by mail now.", "YTA. Your daughter is an adult and you\u2019re making decisions about where she can make purchases? I\u2019m not surprised she moved out. Run your own life and leave her alone.", "YTA- Dude, what is your problem? You just wasted her money. So what if she likes to shop online that sounds like its not your business especially since shes in her thirties. Not to mention, what you also did is illegal", "YTA. \nWhat problem is there if she orders online?\nMaybe she just doesn't like going outside?\nNothing wrong with being an introvert. As a mother just love her and let her do her own thing if it isn't hurting anyone.", "What in the world? Yes you\u2019re absolutely TA. It\u2019s 2023. People order stuff online. She\u2019s a working professional and likes the convenience. And it\u2019s not like she\u2019s a freeloader, she offered to pay you rent. You just don\u2019t approve of her lifestyle which is very common and modern. Besides that, it\u2019s not even a big thing. She\u2019s ordering packages, big whoop. I\u2019m blown away that your first resort was to be vindictive and conniving sending away your daughter\u2019s possessions because YOU think she should be going to the store. What the hell?", "YTA\n\n>I told her that something had to be done and I tried explaining my point\n\nWhat exactly is your point? You prefer going to the shops. She prefers ordering online. So, what do you gain by trying to force her to do things your way?", "YTA. We're in 2023, ordering online is a really common way to get stuff delivered to your door instead of going to the store and finding it to not be in stock. Why would you get in your daughter's business, she is obviously old enough to make her own decisions. You had no right to return her packages to make her go to the store.", "YTA without a shadow of a doubt. She is an adult doing this with her own money. I\u2019m sure she does not agree with all the ways in which you live your own life.\n\nLet her be free to make the choices she wants. Have a conversation about it if it bothers you and then move on and shut up.", "YTA.   What does it matter where she purchases her living supplies?   She bought it with her own money.   That was an asshole move, and you were really wrong for that.  It was controlling and manipulative.  Her getting her supplies from online was not disrupting your household any whatsoever.  You just felt that you knew better and were forcing your opinions on your daughter.  She is right to run as far from you as possible.", "YTA -  her money, her packages, her choice.", "YTA I feel like this is an incredibly weird hill to die on. There are more pressing issues in the world than the popularity of online shopping? What?", "YTA. This is her preference. Probably something she could still afford to do even if she was paying rent. And YOU chose not to take rent. So that's on you. You over stepped and treated her like a teen. It's your chose not to order online. You don't get to force your choices on her.", "YTA. Your daughter is an adult. Those packages were not your property, they were hers. If you have a problem with so many packages coming to your house that's something you can discuss with your ADULT daughter. But it doesn't seem like that's the case. You want to force her to do something outside of her comfort zone that you even admitted yourself is dangerous. I hope she can get into her own flat sooner rather than later so she doesn't have to deal with your crap any more.", "YTA. Why did you feel the need to interfere? It's her business where she buys stuff from and now you've gone and pushed her away for something so silly. I understand how you feel about local shops but you can't just go taking things into your own hands behind someone's back, it's dishonest and weird.", "YTA.  You overstepped.  She is an adult and can make her own shopping decisions.", "Yes, YTA. Good lord.", "YTA for treating her like a child and without telling her in advance that you want the constant deliveries to your home to stop. Did you think she wouldn't figure it out? How did you foresee her reacting to wasting her time shopping without getting what she counted on receiving? Is she being charged for return shipping? No doubt you'll get along better living apart. Who wants to live with a sneaky know-it-all?", "How exactly were you helping her? You don\u2019t get to decide how your daughter chooses to shop. How disrespectful of you", "YTA - leave her be", "YTA. It\u2019s her money and she\u2019s not a child.", "YTA. Just because she's doing things differently than you would doesn't mean she's doing it wrong. Sort yourself out", "YTA. It\u2019s not your stuff. It\u2019s one thing if you had a light conversation about wanting to support local businesses, but she can spend her money how she wants and once she has bought the stuff it is her property and you can\u2019t just get rid of it. \n\nYou thought you were helping her? What logic led you to think that returning stuff she had just ordered was helpful?", "You don't ship stuff back things that aren't yours. She's not a little kid that needs babying. If she chooses to live like this that is her choice. She isn't hurting anyone with it. YTA.", "Yta\n\nIt's how she prefers to shop and her money to spend as she wants\n\nI buy stuff like that online too, because I often can't get what I want locally or it would be more expensive.", "YTA. The items belonged to her.  She is paying for the packages and it does matter whether you agree or not.  She is capable of making her own decisions and has decided to move to a hotel to continue to exercise that right.   Good for her!", "YTA: \"I only wanted to help her\". No, you only wanted to help those business. You wanted to help them so much you decided to risk her banking and credit accounts and throw away her ability to trust you over toothpaste.", "YTA. The world has changed and you are not going to save the retail stores by returning her purchases.", "YTA - Even if you think you had good intentions you treated your daughter like a child and passively aggressively returning her packages. She is an adult, if you felt some sort of way about her order packages delivered to you house, which you agreed to her staying, you should have spoke with her about it. \n\nHow she is suppose to feel comfortable with you doing this behind her back? What if she ordered something she really needed and could only get online? Why does it matter where and how she spends her money? \n\nYou keep treating her like a child, and do things for her \"own good\" but in this way you are creating a rift into your relationship. The only way you can fix this now is by treating her like an adult and talking it through. You can't just decide to know what is best for her without even considering her feelings/thoughts.\n\nI hope you learn from this lesson and find a way to mend your relationship with your daughter. Good luck.", "Omg.  YTA.  I order a lot online and if my mom did this I\u2019d move out too.", "YTA. Completely and totally. Your daughter is 31 years old. Do you cut her food for her too?", "YTA. You sound like my parents, and NC has been an absolute blessing for me.", "Yta. This is fiction right? \nJudgement stands either way.", "YTA why do you feel the need to control your adult daughter? I don\u2019t blame her I wouldn\u2019t want to stay either.", "YTA. When I read the title I thought this would be about a teenager using your credit card and I\u2019d have been on your side. But your daughter is 31. You are way out of line.", "You refused the delivery of someone else\u2019s packages. And you didn\u2019t do it because they were sent to the wrong address, or because they were ordered by mistake.

Good lord.\n\nIf you don't like online shopping, that's your business, but you do not have a right to interfere with other people's property.\n\nDo you have any idea how much you've inconvenienced your daughter by returning those things? Getting refunds is a pain in the ass. Re-ordering items that you returned is a pain in the ass. You weren't helping her, you inconveniencing her and wasting her time.\n\nYour daughter is 100% right, you are treating her like a child and you don't have a right to return her purchases. YTA", "Let me see if I follow this. Your daughter is using her own money to buy necessities and because she isn't shopping local you took it upon yourself to not only mess with her packages, which is illegal here in the states, but also return them without her permission. Yeah I would've moved into a hotel as well. It's very clear you don't respect your daughter. You sound like an old dinosaur blaming the kids these days for the failing shops. Get over yourself and hopefully you can save what relationship you still have with your daughter\n\nEdit: guess what YTA", "YTA. She's an adult and her actions are not yours to control. Yes, the highstreets are dying but tampering with or stealing (depending on how you want to look at it) your daughter's mail is not the answer.", "YTA. Covid is still around so lot of us are limiting our time in public/stores and even if it wasn't your daughter is allowed to prefer the convenience of online shopping.", "Ha, of course YTA. How are you in any way helping her by consistently making her life more difficult? What do you think you\u2019re saving her from, the 21st century?", "YTA. Your daughter is an adult. How she shops has nothing to do with you. Get over yourself", "YTA\n\nWhat exactly is unhealthy about it?\n\nYou grew up and have done things differently from your parents, that's just how it works, the world and how things are done is ever changing.\n\nAlso, she is correct, you did treat her like a child, crossing a boundarie you had no right to cross.", "YTA; people like to shop in different ways; you are such an asshole and are now complaining about her reaction\u2026ugh", "Yeah, OP, YTA a total and complete AH who thought treating her adult daughter like a literal child and taking it upon yourself to decide how your daughter should live her life. You owe her an apology, a huge, sincere apology for being the literal mom from you know where in this instance. You over-reached hardddddddd over this. But hey if you wanted her to get out before she moved away- you did that!", "Seriously, you tried to take away her ability to live as an independent human being.  You treated your 31yr old like a 13yr old, and you're surprised she moved out?  Of course she moved out to where she can make her own decisions.  You're the reason she's \"wasting money.\"  She'd rather spend HER money to be able to live as an adult, rather than put up with your interference and infantilizing.  \n\nYes, you were the AH, and yes you were wrong.", "YTA - If you\u2019re so worried about the economics you should\u2019ve offered to get the items for her instead of trying to manipulate her.", "YTA: She\u2019s acting like a perfectly normal 31 year old, during a pandemic no less. If you felt really strongly about this issue (which is bizarre to me) you could\u2019ve just talked to her like a grownup instead of sneaking around behind her back and making her life harder.", "YTA. You should seriously reevaluate your priorities. Leave your adult child to make her own decisions about where to buy the necessities life requires and leave your judgments and opinions inside your head where they belong. Cut the umbilical cord. It's not your responsibility and you have no right or authority. All of that ended when they became an adult no matter how much it annoys you that you have to relinquish the control you seem to love so much", "YTA\n\n\nwhat or where she spends her money is none of your damn business.\n\nhow dare you be so passive aggressive that you'd return her packages behind her back. coward.", "You do understand unless she's ordering from 3rd party sellers she's probably ordering directly from the store which still helps the brick and mortar stores it just makes it convenient for busy people to get what they need.\n\n\nYTA", "YTA - how is inconveniencing her helping her? Why do you think you have any right to do anything with her deliveries other than let her know where they are?", "YTA. Seek help, you're acting like a nut job", "Try to reverse this.

I would have moved out, too.", "YTA Imagine ruining your relationship with your child because of how they buy toothpaste", "YTA.  Ordering stuff like this is the way of the world now and pretty normal in my area.  Daughter is not single handedly closing down stores.\n\nRegardless it's not OP's place to interfere with daughter's mail and send her stuff back.  Talk about a money waster.", "YTA\n\nThis is messed up.  It's a good example of why some people choose to distance themselves from their parents.  You need to understand that your daughter has grown up and so you need to treat her much like you would any other grown up.  That means there are personal boundaries that shouldn't be crossed.  Treating her belongings as if they are yours is a breach of one of those boundaries.", "YTA. You could have TALKED to your daughter when you saw she was ordering everything online and say you\u2019re concerned about local shops. Instead you went behind her back and returned everything.

You're being judgemental and picky about something that is none of your business.\n\nYTA", "When I first read this I think I got the daughters age backwards in my head and assumed she was 13. I thought there was a slight chance this may not be an asshole thing because she may be a teenager spending parents money. But then I saw her actual age. 31?! Holy cannoli lady you are absolutely TA. What business do you have touching the packages?? How are you even able to return things? Most of the time I've returned anything I've needed to provide proof of purchase or some sort of scannable code. How are you even managing this?\n\nEdit: adding in to ask if your daughter has health issues. She might be shopping online to save herself from contracting a cold or flu and you're essentially telling her that her health doesn't matter. Maybe talk to her and see if there's a reason she feels the need to solely order online.", "YTA.\n\nWith the supply chain and under-staffing, the grocery store doesn't always have the brands I like in stock.

If course, I refused to accept any rent (she offered).\n\nIt\u2019s been great but one thing I\u2019ve noticed is that my daughter has a habit of ordering online. A lot. She runs out of toothpaste? She won\u2019t bother going to the shop, she\u2019ll just order it online with her other essentials like shampoo. Needs clothes or stuff for her new house? She\u2019ll order it. She even bought her father\u2019s birthday gift and wrapping paper online.  She even has groceries delivered because she insisted she pays for them because she lives rent free. She barely goes to shops and because of people like her our high streets are dying. \n\nIt\u2019s unhealthy and every time for a week now, whenever a package came, I returned it which forced her to shop locally a few times.\n\nBut now, because quite a few packages never arrived, she realised what\u2019s been happening and confronted me and she\u2019s fuming. She accused me of treating her like a child and saying I had no right to return her stuff.\n\nI told her that something had to be done and I tried explaining my point but she told me she\u2019s done, package her stuff and went stay at a hotel, wasting money. I asked her to move back, promised to not do it again b it she\u2019s stubborn and won\u2019t listen. She told me she\u2019ll stay at a hotel until she can move into her flat.\n\nI only wanted to help her but she\u2019s being so unreasonable. My husband stays neutral and I don\u2019t know.
