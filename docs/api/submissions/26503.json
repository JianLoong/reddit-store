He takes them fun places and can pay for a birthday party wherever they want. He'll also buy them nice clothes and shoes.

Does she expect him to buy her other kids their first phones? Or not buy as nice of a car for his two kids because you can\u2019t afford it for the others? What about college? Does she expect the other two to settle for not as good of college so the others don\u2019t feel bad or does she expect Toby to pay their tuition too?! What about sports? Are his kids not allowed to join clubs and sports because your sister can\u2019t afford it for the others? What about vacations? Is he not allowed to take his kids to cool places because she can\u2019t afford to? Life isn\u2019t fair sometimes and your sisters other kids will have to learn that sooner or later. Either way it\u2019s NOT Toby\u2019s responsibility to provide those things for kids that aren\u2019t his. Teaching his kids to be humble and not to brag or be jerks about things.. yes that should be expected.\n\nAs for parties and things like that.. I can see her point there, but end of the day that choice should be the kids, especially if they aren\u2019t getting along and the other kids presence would ruin the party for them. If they truly don\u2019t want to invite them they shouldn\u2019t have to. Forcing them to include the others will just drive a further wedge and create resentment. If they DO want the other kids there and Toby isn\u2019t letting them just to be petty then I agree with her on that one point.\n\nWhere is her new husband in all this?

Life isn't always fair on blended families. \n\nTrust me...I got the \"their dad pays child support so they get extras, your mom didn't so you dont\" speech, when one parent of each of the kids is in the new \"blended\" family.\n\n It's not nice to be told that, but the mom has no right at all to demand that the ex make gifts etc to her kids born since they split. Her only option is to bring up in a petition in court that he is \"too generous\" the next time they're scheduled to go to bat over visitation, support etc, and then she can discuss it with the courts and see what they say. ...and probably be told pound sand I bet, since he's providing for his kids.

Your sister's desire to have her ex pay for her other children is absolutely out of line and if it's not his children it's not his responsibility. However, her concern that there will be tension in the household because some of her kids have more than the others is absolutely valid. \n\nAs an example, my partner's mother had all 4 of her children with different men. 2 of her half siblings (a brother and sister) are still adolescent and therefore live with her mother. Her brother's dad is an absolute deadbeat who can't even afford child support whereas her sister's dad actually has a job and stuck around to help out. Every week he takes the sister out and they go get food or sometimes he buys her presents and for her birthday her grandparents on her dad's side gives her a lot of birthday money whereas the brother can only get what his mother can afford for him as he has nobody else. This disparity has absolutely fostered resentment and negative behaviour in the brother and I think everyone needs to understand that ultimately children are involved and they're absolutely going to fall prey to these feelings of jealousy. \n\nMy personal opinion is that you should speak to your sister and try to tell her you understand her frustrations but that the language that she has employed is unacceptable and counterintuitive to what her aims are. It could entirely possible that she is just trying to extort more money from her ex but her genuinity is a judgement that you have to make for yourself.
