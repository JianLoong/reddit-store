My sister and Toby share custody of their kids. \n\nToby is better off financially than my sister. He pays child support for the kids and he covers all medical expenses per their court order. But Toby can still afford to treat them and buy them stuff they want. According to my sister they have \"fancy lunchboxes\" whatever that means, they have gaming consoles and laptops at their dads house. He takes them fun places and can pay for a birthday party wherever they want. He'll also buy them nice clothes and shoes. I never saw the problem with this but my sister said it caused some tension in their house because the girls are jealous of what her kids have and are jealous of the fact they have much better birthday parties than them.\n\nMy sister actually told Toby he needs to start ensuring that her other kids have the same things. She said he's making sure their kids together will never bond with their stepsister, step cousin and half brother by making it clear they have more. She told him he also needs to invite those kids to the parties he throws for their kids. Toby told her no and said it was her job to worry about her other kids but he's not doing a single thing for the rest of her kids.\n\nMy sister has been pretty ragey since he refused and she complains about it a lot. Eventually she told me all about it when it was just the two of us and she mentioned how she wants Toby to basically pay money for the girls and her new son and that she wants him to buy them gifts and let the kids she shares with him bring the stuff he buys them to her house so everyone can get a use out of them. She said it's selfish for him to not care about the other kids. She claims he has a responsibility. I said she was sounding very entitled with that attitude and she needs to understand she's responsible for more than two kids but Toby?

Does she expect him to buy her other kids their first phones? Or not buy as nice of a car for his two kids because you can\u2019t afford it for the others? What about college? Does she expect the other two to settle for not as good of college so the others don\u2019t feel bad or does she expect Toby to pay their tuition too?! What about sports? Are his kids not allowed to join clubs and sports because your sister can\u2019t afford it for the others? What about vacations? Is he not allowed to take his kids to cool places because she can\u2019t afford to? Life isn\u2019t fair sometimes and your sisters other kids will have to learn that sooner or later. Either way it\u2019s NOT Toby\u2019s responsibility to provide those things for kids that aren\u2019t his. Teaching his kids to be humble and not to brag or be jerks about things.. yes that should be expected.\n\nAs for parties and things like that.. I can see her point there, but end of the day that choice should be the kids, especially if they aren\u2019t getting along and the other kids presence would ruin the party for them. If they truly don\u2019t want to invite them they shouldn\u2019t have to. Forcing them to include the others will just drive a further wedge and create resentment. If they DO want the other kids there and Toby isn\u2019t letting them just to be petty then I agree with her on that one point.\n\nWhere is her new husband in all this?

However, her concern that there will be tension in the household because some of her kids have more than the others is absolutely valid. \n\nAs an example, my partner's mother had all 4 of her children with different men. 2 of her half siblings (a brother and sister) are still adolescent and therefore live with her mother. Her brother's dad is an absolute deadbeat who can't even afford child support whereas her sister's dad actually has a job and stuck around to help out. Every week he takes the sister out and they go get food or sometimes he buys her presents and for her birthday her grandparents on her dad's side gives her a lot of birthday money whereas the brother can only get what his mother can afford for him as he has nobody else. This disparity has absolutely fostered resentment and negative behaviour in the brother and I think everyone needs to understand that ultimately children are involved and they're absolutely going to fall prey to these feelings of jealousy. \n\nMy personal opinion is that you should speak to your sister and try to tell her you understand her frustrations but that the language that she has employed is unacceptable and counterintuitive to what her aims are. It could entirely possible that she is just trying to extort more money from her ex but her genuinity is a judgement that you have to make for yourself.
