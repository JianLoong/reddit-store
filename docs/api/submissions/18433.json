Culturally speaking there are differences in species and ingredients that cultures may use.

Suppliers also may not provide a wide variety of spices and food options. \n\nHowever, race honestly doesn't even affect that as you can be of any race and still be part of a certain culture regionally speaking.

Why can\u2019t you take something of your own to eat or to contribute to the BBQ?   Why can\u2019t you just say to the family, l\u2019m sorry, but I have tried your foods and the spices are just not to my taste?  Can you make a portion without them?

I feel bad for your husband and kids.", "Okay I\u2019m going to go with YTA but not for not liking spicy food.\n\nFirst of all, you are not racist for not liking spices. Some people don\u2019t like, or can\u2019t tolerate spicy food. That isn\u2019t a Black thing it isn\u2019t a white thing, it\u2019s a \u201cDo you like spicy food?\u201d thing. Now you may have been raised in a family that never had spicy food, so that makes you more sensitive. But perpetuating the stereotype that \u201cwhite\u201d food is by default non-spicy doesn\u2019t do anyone any good. \n\nYou have every right to not like spicy food and never eat it if you want. That\u2019s fine. But let\u2019s look closely at how you are choosing to talk about that preference.\n\nYou felt the need to start off this story to a bunch of internet strangers with.  \u201chis family has Black DNA, not to the point where we have mixed kids\u2026\u201d\n\nWhy did you need to tell us that? Are you afraid of having mixed-race kids? You essentially said, my boyfriend\u2019s skin is pale enough that our relationship is okay. \n\nThere was no reason at all you couldn\u2019t start out this story with. \u201cMy boyfriend\u2019s family has Black roots and they like to cook really spicy food, and I really don\u2019t like spicy food.\u201d\n\nInstead you had to clarify to all of us, he\u2019s Black but he doesn\u2019t LOOK Black, so my relationship is acceptable and my kids don\u2019t count as mixed-race. But if his skin happened to be darker that would be a different story\u2026 Maybe you should unpack that a little because I have a feeling this sort of thing is sneaking in places in your attitude and it\u2019s not a good look.\n\nNext problem is, \u201cI always left when the food was served.\u201d You have set up a pattern of socially abandoning his family during a party, over and over again. At the first BBQ you could have spoken with the host, or his Mom, and explained that you don\u2019t want to be rude, but spicy food really doesn\u2019t agree with you and is there anything a little tamer you could try? Or you could offer to bring a salad and dessert and lean on that for the day. I am willing to bet a couple of comfort food sides would have started showing up at these BBQs to help you feel welcome, because that\u2019s what good hosts do when they know there\u2019s a problem.\n\nBut you have gone five to six years of walking out of the family\u2019s bonding activity without ever talking to them or giving them the chance to make you more comfortable. You abandoned them over and over again. \n\nAre they assholes for calling you \u201cracist\u201d? Maybe the message they have been receiving for years is \u201cThis person doesn\u2019t like spending time with us.\u201d\n\nOr they could have just been teasing you. I don\u2019t know the tone here, but if you handled that poke in the ribs with some humor and grace, you could have turned that into a bonding moment too. Instead you got hurt and angry and walked out again.\n\nIt sounds like your boyfriend\u2019s mother is trying to be accommodating and kind. Accept that gracious gift and find a compromise that allows you to stay together with people the whole time.\n\nReally take a deep look in your heart about how you feel about blackness and your children\u2019s roots. You are making an effort to learn to cook special things for them and that is very kind, but you can also make this food special to this side of the family and explain to your kids that it is a part of who they are and best when shared with the people who love them. Then ask your boyfriend why he can\u2019t cook these things. He\u2019s the one that grew up watching in the kitchen, not you. You are new at this.\n\nIf the family ever teases you about not wanting to eat spicy food, you can say, \u201cAlas, my people come from a place where the clouds are thick, and the snow is deep. Plant life is rare on these wasted lands. We only eat tree-bark and sadness\u2026\u201d\n\nChances are everyone will laugh and when you say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry spicer things just do bad things to me,\u201d later, that will be accepted too.\n\nWhen white people hear the word Racist lobbed at them they tend to think \u201cHe just called me an evil person.\u201d\n\nYou are not evil or bad. But you have been separating yourself and your heart from this family, even if it\u2019s in little ways that don\u2019t feel like a big deal to you, and that hurts over time. That\u2019s YTA.\n\nBut you can fix it. Good luck.", "How \u201clight\u201d must you be to use less spices. The darker the berry doesn\u2019t apply to spices.", "My husband is as white as they come.

So I started making things hotter and adding sourcream to cool mine. Now I can tolerate much more and quite often don't notice if something is spicy even though my sister is telling me it is. That said I don't like food so spicy that you can't actually taste anything. It has to have flavour as well as heat", "Yeah definitely retirement age at least. Probably more common in rural areas too.", "I did look up genetics and spice tolerancy, and found that there is no specific gene that determines spice tolerancy.\nPeople with fewer TRPV1 receptors *might* start out with a higher spice tolerancy simply because those receptors bind to capsaicin, and so they may have a natural affinity towards spicy foods because they can handle them better, but that doesn't mean that others can't build up a tolerance and handle them just as well. \n\nI never said that people should \"have to build up a tolerance if they're not interested\" just that using their \"whiteness\" as an excuse as to why they can't handle spicy food isn't necessarily apt. \n\nEta words", "Yes, exactly.   Well said!"]}
