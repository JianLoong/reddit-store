Also, I find it unlikely that every dish was spicy.", "Black DNA has not a damn thing to do with the spiciness of the food they cook\n\n>I felt that would have been more disrespectful than leaving for 10-15 minutes then coming back \n\nYou were wrong. You went off and got food only for yourself instead of bringing back or making something to share with the group. You are disrespectful to your boyfriend and his family.  Your boyfriend must be so embarrassed.  You don't lift a finger to make yourself part of the family aside from showing up.\n\nYTA\n\nEDIT:\n\n> I would just like to say: 1) this was my first time going to the BBQ as my boyfriend tells me what food is served so I had never gone before. \n\nThat's certainly not the impression i got from reading your original post. \n\nDo you really believe there aren't people with dark skin who enjoy bland food?", "This did not help you one bit.

You said you have been going for 5 years, since your daughter was born.\n2. Black DNA?  What are you even talking about?! So your boyfriend is at least 1/2 black.  Who cares.

Well, you were wrong and based on the nephew/cousin- whoever calling you racist is because you always leave and I\u2019m sure there is more to it in that regard.\n5.  The grandparents are being nice!  \n \n6.  You sound incredibly stupid.", "If you don't like spicy food just tell them you don't like spicy food and see if they will have food to accommodate you. But your assumption that Black people automatically have a stronger palate for spicy food is odd as hell. I know plenty of Black people who don't care for spicy food at all. And also not all spices are actually spicy. I don't imagine they are casually serving food with ghost pepper and whatnot.", "Ok.. sure.\n\nAnyway point in hand, the food issue.

And on top of that, I live in Australia and we ALWAYS were taught to bring something to a BBQ, so it's was either a nice pasta salad or some other salad or some extra meat, I just find it so strange that you can't bring food, or there was absolutely nothing that wasn't spicy for you to eat!", "Ummm seems you are making shit up as you go along. You say that you've left the bbqs before so this can't be your \"first\" time going. But even if it is, in FIVE years you've never gone to a function?

So with that OP has never actually tried the food and just assumed based on 1 dish or based on their race the food would be spicy or she thinks her BFs family is dirty and just doesn\u2019t want to eat their food so makes up outrageous excuses. 5 years and you haven\u2019t found out by now?
