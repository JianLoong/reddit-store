Culturally speaking there are differences in species and ingredients that cultures may use.

Suppliers also may not provide a wide variety of spices and food options. \n\nHowever, race honestly doesn't even affect that as you can be of any race and still be part of a certain culture regionally speaking.

Just the SMELL of his spicy food makes my eyes water. Meanwhile, I can barely eat mild salsa some days!", "Right!? If it's not like having a battle in my mouth, it's not worth eating. If eating it makes me feel like a dragon breathing fire, we're on the right track.", "Wow!  It sounds like your food should be outlawed by the Geneva Conventions as chemical warfare.   :-D\n\nI get laughed at by my children because I complain about spicy food making my scalp sweat.  I also was once teased about calling Tim Horton's Chicken Noodle Soup \"spicy\".  :-D", "Same. The Ghanese shop guy always checks with me if i am sure in want to buy the spicy dish because its very spicy. An innocent form of prejudice i guess", "Hello, fellow beacon of Gondor :)\n May the spices be with you", "My skin is the color of wonderbread and I eat maximum heat Thai and Indian food. I often spend the next day on the can. Super weird to associate those things.", "It sounds like the family just cook good food. I'm also 100% white and I cannot stand bland food, I use all assortments of herbs and spices while I know other households that use maybe a bit of salt and Mayo. Race has nothing to do with it. I've never heard anyone say \"they have a tiny bit of black DNA so their food is spicy\" like what", "In grad school, we used to have curry nights where the point was to try to make it as hot as humanly possible. We all had tears in our eyes and were sweating like crazy, but it was fun and good. And we were all white Europeans, European Americans, and Asian American.", "Can attest. I\u2019m half black half asian and I can\u2019t eat really spicy food. It\u2019s not about the race", "My kid is literally known as \u201cthe pale kid with the hair\u201d and he drinks hot sauce straight from the bottle.  Race has nothing to do with how spicy someone likes their food.", "I'm Mexican and my see-through white husband can out spicy me and most of my family.", "How many asshole colors are there?", "Its not right unless you burn a hole in the couch", "I am not sure where the \"whites don't like hot or spicy\" thing came from but its seems like white folks were the ones who created these insane hot sauces like \"satans anus blasting lava from hell\" or \"death is to good for what will happen to your ass\" hot sauces.\n\nLike they taste like lava from a volcano and they leave feeling like lava from a volcano, and the folks who create it....are sterotyped as people who don't like hot and spicy.\n\nMakes no sense to me.", "She means colour cuz she is a racist", "I mean, she probably thinks plain yellow mustard is spicy. Or that raisins belong in potato salad.", "I so hope this happens.", ">OP couldn't hide her race comments in 6 paragraphs.\n\nWhich doesn't mean she's the source of those comments. If you spend a decent chunk of time around people saying \"I'm X, so my food's (too) spicy (for white people)\", the idea that \"X people eat spicy food, because they are X\" would not seem wrong to you. And I've seen plenty of those on this sub. Of course, OP could be hiding a whole lot of stuff that happened, but I see no reason to assume she is.", "You might well be right but if they're judging her and are happy to let someone sit there and call her names it seems like there are other things in play here and she doesn't feel welcome or included.", "Wow, OP did you just lie despite what you already posted?", ">, I've never been to a BBQ where every single food item has been insanely spicy, even if the people like spice, there is always some options.\n\nRight? Spices \u2260 spicy. I find it ridiculously hard to believe that OP can't have ANY spices.", "Agreed. In my family, if you show up at the BBQ empty-handed, you will get the side eye and be branded a mooch.", "I think they may have offered to make accommodations,  but she is pouting because they are not catering to her in the way she wants. \n\nIf they did not care about what she could handle, they would not have bothered warning her that their food tends to be spicy. And spicy is a vague term. \"Too spicy\" means different things to different people. \n\nTo some people, any amount of heat is too spicy. For others, using anything more exotic than salt and pepper is too spicy. To some people, using a variety of spices in one dish is too spicy.  And still others will not touch their food without a bottle of pepper sauce at the table. \n\nIf she has never eaten with them, they have no idea of what she considers spicy, and it would be difficult to accommodate her needs. It is not as clear-cut as it would be if she had food allergies, kept Kosher,  or was a vegetarian or vegan. There are well established, objective guidelines for these issues that they can plan for. One cannot plan for something as subjective as spice level. Warning her was the kindest option. It gave her the opportunity to plan. She chose not to do so.", "maybe she didnt wanna be around there for other reasons", "Iirc your spice levels are a gene thing, so people who can't handle it can't actually help it. Vice versa.\n\nNothing to do it OP being white though, lmao.", "I have a friend that we used to make fun of for this. They told me that salsa was too spicy for them. It was a running joke that they were so white they couldn\u2019t handle flavour. \n\nTurns out they\u2019re allergic to capsaicin", "I joke that salt is too spicy sometimes \ud83e\udd23", "He cares for you lol", "The spice must flow.", "I eat spicy stuff and end up in the bathroom for the next 4 hours \ud83d\ude31", "> don't see any reason to eat something when all I can taste is pain\n\nAin't that the truth! I love spicy food, but if all there is to it is \"heat\" and no flavour, I'm out. :D", "It's just a tolerance matter I think. Places like central America where chilies grow abundantly, they eat them from when they can start eating solid foods and so they get used to food being spicy. Traditional meals found in cultures predominantly made up of white people don't often contain spice just because they're less abundant in the areas where they live. But white people are just as capable biologically of handling spicy. So I think in these cultures, they do it cause they wanna show off how much spice they can handle, whereas in cultures that have had Chilies for millenia it's not as big of a deal who can handle spice cause they all have since they were babies.\n\nPersonally, I grew up not eating much spicy foods and as such my tolerance level is about a jalapeno with no real desire of improving it", "And there's no actual FLAVOR to most of those sauces, I honestly think it's a \"prove your manliness \" thing with those.  My ex used to brag about his tolerance for \"spicy food\" and it was literally flavorless \"hot sauces\" that he would *prove* his tolerance by taking a spoonful.  Like that is really kinda sad to me honestly.", "I don't, for the sake of her child.", "Sure, but it could also mean she is. If you're gonna assume others put the idea in her head and they're the ones making race comments, why is it bad to point out that it's possible OP is the source of these comments? And the fact she emphasizes that her kids aren't mixed just gives me bad vibes.", "Yeah I was sort of being sarcastic in my comment at the start, lol, trying to draw her out in being honest with us. Because IMO there is no way that every single things at that BBQ is spicy. And the fact she hasn't been to one family BBQ in 5 years? So strange.", "Why jump to conclusions like that? People who have been exposed to \"black\" stereotypes, just like black people have been exposed to \"white\" stereotypes might have false beliefs about the other race. It doesn't make OP a racist. Stop being such snowflakes.", "That's not actually true you can build your tolerance over time", "Genes might have some impact, but it's definitely more about what you're used to. A lot of old white British people have zero spice tolerance l, because they were raised without spicy food. Most young white British people love a good curry.\n\nThe idea that white people genetically can't handle spice is nonsense.", "I think maybe you're thinking of cilantro?\nPeople who have an aversion to cilantro is because of a gene thing.\n\nYou can definitely build a tolerance to spicy foods... Being white is not an excuse \ud83d\ude02\n\nEta words", "My brother's girlfriend sincerely thought black pepper was almost too much to handle. She's been improving, though.", "Fun fact: Chipotle peppers are just ripe jalape\u00f1os that are dried by smoking and thus give a much better flavor in recipes!"]}
