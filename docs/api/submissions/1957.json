What are the fun activities?", "Poems, dancing and singing already sound like a nightmare to me, let alone 2 days with a group of people i dont know yet. What sounds like fun to one person, can be another persons panick attack.", "Does your husband have any type of social anxiety or is he an extreme introvert which would make this much at once hard on him?", "I get you want him to meet everyone, but I'd be uncomfortable AF doing a dance to welcome the couple and make up short poems about each other, in front of people I'd never met before. That's not 'fun'  for some people, its terrifying and anxiety filled. \n\nHe could at least try the games night. \n\nAnd he also hasn't said he doesn't want to try and get along with them either. \n\nESH\n\nInfo: is there cultural difference between you both?", "YTA\n\nYour husband is an introvert. You are telling him he has to dance in public and improvise poetry in front of people he doesn't know, who may very well be actively judging him the entire time. You are not listening to his needs, you are insisting that these events are fun. They're fun for you, but clearly not for him. Your \"compromise\" was for him to attend two of the most stressful days or not come at all. In a comment you mentioned he said you should be grateful he's planning to come at all- that is true. You're bringing him to an enormous multi-day event where he will be surrounded by strangers trampling his boundaries, wearing out his energy reserves, forced to interact with your family and make a good impression for your benefit. He's asked if he can go with you to meet everyone and not have to participate in the games and events. THAT is the true compromise, because he's willing to put himself through emotional turmoil to meet your family, and your response thus far has been to call him a killjoy and tell him if he doesn't fully participate exactly the way the extroverts do, then he shouldn't bother going at all. \n\nThis isn't even YOUR wedding. Why do you unilaterally get to decide someone else's wedding guest list? The person whose wedding this is should be the one telling your husband which events they're expected to attend as an invitee. Hopefully *that* person will at least have some compassion for your husband.", "Info: what are weddings like in his culture?", "NTA. Honestly, for my partner I would totally stay 5 days, do every activity (or at least try my best doing them) and try to get along with everyone, even if I might need a week (or two... or even more, social exhaustion is real) rest afterwards since I'm an introvert. Your husband is an AH for not even wanting to be there 2 days and participate.", "NTA. \n\nYou and your family have made accommodations for him, and he doesn't want to compromise at all. So now you've presented the options fairly - come and participate a little in some key things (with the option to go elsewhere to decompress as needed), or just don't come. That's fair. Nobody wants a grouch at a party. \n\nIt's so strange though that this is his first chance to meet most of your family, and he doesn't want to interact with them at all? That's incredibly rude, to all of them and to you. Why go at all if he doesn't seem interested in being involved in the slightest? Does he know how much this means to you, and to your family?", "Soft YTA. I kind of understand your logic that if he doesn't participate, then what's the point of him going.\n\nHowever, I completely see his side as well. Lots of people would love to be at a wedding, or other event, but not everyone is comfortable participating in the activities. And your ultimatum said he wholeheartedly tries to get along with your family or don't come. That's very unfair.", "I have to say ESH. He should try to get on with your family but you cant expect him to do a dance or poem if he is uncomfortable with that. Why can't he try to do things with them he is comfortable with?  \nThere is no way in hell I would participate in a dance our a poem when I would meet my SO family. I am to introverted for that.", "INFO - Is your extended family's approval so much more important that your husband's discomfort?\nYou are a clear extrovert from all your responses but your husband seems to be an introvert.\n\nYour family will not miss your husband's participation in forced group acitivities.\nYou are clearly trying to manipulate your husband into participating by telling him not to show up otherwise. Indian Guilt Trip 101.\n\nAs an Indian Introvert, I can say that Indian weddings (especially in North) can seem very fun to extroverts but to introverts/socially anxious people, they can be panic inducing.", "NTA but maybe let him be there for the ceremony  / banquet and not here for the fun things? It\u2019s his loss anyways. Just let him get bored and enjoy with your family!", "To be honest, not all attending males are likely to participate in these events itself. I think the fact that he is around to support you is great. It would be wrong to force anyone, introverted or not, to do something that they are not comfortable with. Will you uninvite other guests who don\u2019t do the bidding ? It may be unfair to uninvite your husband and have you thought about the repercussions on your relationship ?", "Yta", "If your husband has social anxiety/is introverted I completely understand where he's coming from.  The dance and poem would be a hard pass for me, but I'd happily play cards/games.\n\nHow about having a discussion with him about what activities he is/isn't comfortable with and go from there?", "NTA although I'll be honest, both the dance and couple games sound like a nightmare to me, cause I'm an introvert and very bad at following any sort of a dance routine. I'd discuss that with my partner and find out what I can participate in or how to make it less panic inducing. Your husband sounds like a killjoy, is he always like that?", "NTA. I can see where he might not be comfortable with some of the activities but this is one of those situations where you suck it up and make the best of it. It usually ends up being the best time you\u2019ll have.", "NTA.   If he is not going to participate in the wedding functions, what's the point of going?   Maybe you should try getting him to disinvite himself (perhaps citing disrespect for your parents) but it that fails disinvite him yourself (possible for disrespecting your parents).", "NTA. You've given him the choice. It would be painful for him and awkward for everyone if he was there looking glum and not participating. Your solution is solid: go and participate or don't go.", "Nta. Why does he want to come at all if he doesn\u2019t want to participate for even 2 days?", "NTA\n\nBut honestly having to dance and recite poems in front of people I don\u2019t know is a perfect picture of hell for me.\nIsn\u2019t there anything less demanding he can do? Idk dinner? Attend a ceremony?", "That wedding sounds fun. And exhausting,  lol. I'd go. Heck, I'd drag my wife. I'd dance her little butt off, then tuck her in a chair with the aunties, bring her food then go visiting with everyone. We'd have a crap ton of stories to tell once we were back home for the next year. Knowing my wife, she'd have a crapton of new recipes to try, a couple of new crochet stitches under her belt and care packages coming randomly with spices and yarn.\nYour husband is, like, being rude. Go without him. Have fun.", "NTA: sounds like he is disrespecting your culture.", "NTA", "NTA but maybe you two are just not compatible.

Or is he rather shy or maybe even has some sort of anxiety?\n\nTo me, all of that sounds a lot of fun, but I can imagine that some might not like to be that outgoing (eg like dancing or improvising a poem in front of an audience). You have to be an outgoing personality to feel comfortable with that.", "NTA, OP I was married to a guy like this who just could not participate in normal social bonding. It did not work out because he simply could not get over himself to be able to enjoy the fun (or necessary) parts of interpersonal relationships. \n\nI went to social engagements alone for TEN STRAIGHT YEARS before divorcing him. My new husband is also an \u201cintrovert\u201d with social anxiety and definitely does not seek out situations like this but has told me over and over again he wants to be by my side for life - for all of it. I couldn\u2019t possibly love him more, and (like you) I go out of my way to compromise and ensure I\u2019m not asking for anything other than the bare minimum.", "NTA.

This is honestly a YTA bc she's just upset bc she's extroverted and thinks he's being a wet blanket", "Added it to the post but it's just small stuff like a small group dance, game night and some games for couples where you have to come up with a poem based on a prompt.", "He's an introvert. So I definitely feel like my ultimatum could make me the asshole here but on the other hand it's two days and the only wedding we're going to attend  ( I only have one sibling). So feels kindof shitty to not have him fully into it", "Oh I'm sorry I just misread your question. He's Indian too so pretty much the same. His sister also had a big wedding so it's not that different", "It's an Indian wedding so they are really fun with lots of food,dancing, and then ceremonies in between.", "You're a kind partner. I would do this too - I would actually be excited to meet people", "I can see that.", "Im not introverted, but I would be absolutely miserable if you had me doing that shit. Id still do it, but your family would hate me for being visibly unhappy and not participating in things I found unenjoyable \u201cwholeheartedly.\u201d The whole smile while I make you do things you hate for days is what makes you also an AH and brings this into the ESH category.", "This is the only thing that makes me feel like I might be an asshole. I feel like it is could be Kindof extra and a lot to ask", "It\u2019s definitely a cultural thing, it would be very rude and odd to not be able to do this. \n\nI\u2019m introverted but I think what you are describing is social anxiety if you literally canNOT do it.", "It's less about family approval and more about actually being around when the family is together. I really want him to get to know them and not participating takes him away from the group.\n\nBut he's definitely an introvert so I can see how this might be too much for him", "What an odd lens to see this through - why would only men not participate? I\u2019ve been to these types of events and the men are *flamboyantly* enjoying themselves right alongside the women. It\u2019s a huge family thing that is considered normal and not difficult to deal with.", "Ya he's been a kill-joy for a while now but that could be other things like stress that's making it worse.\n\nI like this idea of finding something that he can participate in that aren't so on the spot but I have no ideas for what those could be", "Ya i think I'm going to try this. My family is not going to be happy but atleast I know now that what I'm asking for is not too much", "This is my biggest worry,especially since I'm very close to my family and everyone is so excited to meet him", "He says he's making effort to make it and I should be thankful that he's coming at all", "He's Indian too.", "So him being disengaged for your culture says a lot about him.\n\nI\u2019m Indian and my husband is American. He is the most introverted man you will ever meet. HE however recognizes the formalities of my culture and the engagement aspects of the immediate family. It is hard for him BUT he tries to engage in the activities and the family, because it\u2019s my culture and it\u2019s about me.", "Have you asked him if he would even like to come? \n\nSounds like he's not even half interested.\n\nIf the above statement is true, work him into saying no himself, rather than uninviting him; then just make up an excuse like 'work is on top of him', 'big promotion on its way and can't take a day off' etc etc.\n\nIn all honesty though, hate to say it, but he sounds like a complete dick.", "It would definitely be worse if your family knew your husband was in the country and just choosing not to come to the wedding events.  That would be extremely disrespectful to your family (and you).\n\nNTA", "A dance and a poem. Like panick attacks waiting to happen for introverts.", "Oh no. My husband is an introvert with pretty serious social anxiety and that sounds like it would be *misery* for him.\n\nIf I were in your situation, I would bring my husband along but let him dictate which events he goes to and doesn\u2019t go to because I don\u2019t want him to be miserable but I want him to be welcome to the events he feels comfortable going to and I would be happy to have him there with me. I care more about my husband not being miserable than I care about what my extended family would think about him not being there.", "Yeah YTA. one person's fun is another's stress, and forcing it on your clearly introverted partner shows a severe lack of empathy from you", "The ultimatum really is kinda bad though. I'm indian too and I would definitely feel uncomfortable participating in a dance, reading out poems and singing etc. I would like to be there and have fun/support the couple in my own way. If he wants to be there, enjoy the wedding in his way by encouraging people on their fun activities, then he should be able to do that. Your way of \"if you don't do all those activities, then don't come\" is really shitty. \n\nIs forcing him to do those activities because you want to support your brother is much more important than making sure your husband is comfortable? \n\nYou're clearly the extrovert so this might just be fun to you but it's not for him. If he wants to be there, he should be but forcing him to do the activities or else not be there is a bad move.\n\nAlso I don't think it's your place to uninvite him from your brother's wedding. It should come from your brother. If they all want him to be there, then he should be there.", "OP, I second what kaizersigma is saying here too. Can you compromise and have him there with you without participating in all the extras? It\u2019s the extras that sound like he doesn\u2019t want to do. Would he be open to just being there and taking it all in??", "As an introvert yta,  let him participate  in what he is somewhat  comfortable  and explain  your family.", "Giving him an ultimatum is kinda shitty regardless. You're asking someone who's an introvert to jump in with every single person but you being a stranger and to deal with that energy for 2 full days. He knows NOBODY. That has to be incredibly overwhelming and slightly selfish on your part. And if your family doesn't understand, then so be it. YTA", "Oh he knows the deal then. NTA", "I'm not gonna make a ruling yet but I will say with my social anxiety I prefer to not need to hard commit to all the scheduled activities some like and then if I'm overwhelmed I'm not letting anyone down last minute.", "We just did this a month ago. We\u2019re not Indian but in our own western way we had 3 days nonstop of restaurants, family walks, wedding+ long party, bars, caf\u00e9s, drinks, more food. My husband had only met my siblings and parents. He made the effort for this 3 days and then it was over! It goes by so fast. So many cousins and activities and we survived. I hope your husband comes with you and you enjoy the family and your traditions together.", "Yeah if my partner invited me to an event where I had to come up with a poem off the top of my head it would be a hard pass from me. The rest seems fine but if he\u2019s not going to join in then probably best he stays home", "Can u guys come to a middle ground? Maybe do a breakfast just with the cousins or a late night drive?\nBasically set up in a less anxiety inducing environment just with the people most important to you.", "Is he depressed? Something stressfull going on at work?\n\nAt any case, he should be coming to you with a conversation, if he needs to figure out a less stressfull way to participate, you can't really decide for him what that would be. Good luck", "Been in a similar situation and it's so hard because you don't want your partner to be uncomfortable but it's understandably important to you that your partner and family have a good relationship.\n\nYou're not in the wrong for looking for solutions to this. It's a shame your partner is not willing or able to power through for you here.", "You should really consider whether this is the man you want to spend the rest of your life with; he speaks of himself '\\[you\\] should be thankful' like he's some gem that's fallen from the nether.\n\nActual truth is that he can hardly muster up the energy to show his face for two days.\n\nSounds like a low energy asshole.", "That\u2019s a really AHlish thing to say. Like you have to be grateful he\u2019s deigned himself to go to your brothers wedding. I wouldn\u2019t want to take my partner to any event or celebration if he\u2019s just gonna sit there with a glum look on his face. You\u2019ve even tried to give him options so he\u2019s not overwhelmed. You couldn\u2019t be more accommodating.\n\nAll the activities and that sound really fun, and it\u2019s not like they require a lot of effort.", "Sheesh, thankful? For his generous decision to dismiss and insult your whole family?", "It just seems like there is no point in him coming if he\u2019s not joining in the festivities.. is he like this about everything", "Well then it sounds like you should do all of you a favor and rescind his invitation.", "He's also Indian but very introverted", "People keep saying \u201cintroverts\u201d but that\u2019s not what an introvert is. \n\nBeing unable to participate in these (very normal) traditions is more along the lines of severe anxiety or absolute lack of social skills.", "Not reading but creating  on the spot ,I would  be a wreck", "Thanks for the perspective I can see how it's a lot but I do feel that 2 days of full immersion is a fair compromise. But I can see how these are just uncomfortable for him", "It seems they can't since OP stated that he said she should be grateful he is coming. He is not partner of the year", "She came up w/ a middle ground to accommodate him already. He doesn't have to attend all 5 days, he gets to miss a lot of stuff, but this is specifically the family bonding stuff where it is expected show.", "I've been thinking about this a lot lately \ud83d\ude2d", "Not for someone  with anxiety.  Think of something  outside  your comfort  zone completely  and the think if he would  tell you  you have to do it 2 days entirely.", "Think harder. Take the time with your family as a respite and make a decision for the long term."]}
