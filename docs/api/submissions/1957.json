He is unwilling to participate in any of the fun activities we have planned for the 2 days that he's going to be at the wedding and I told him that if he doesn't want to wholeheartedly participate and atleast try to get along with my family - then I was uninviting him from the wedding. AITA?\n\nINFO: the activities are: participating in a small group dance to welcome the newly married couple, a game night (card games), and a few games like couples getting a prompt and having to come up with a short poem about eachother\n\nUPDATE : thank you everyone for weighing in. I definitely see and understand both points of view. I was definitely in my head because it's the only wedding with my family that he will attend but I guess I didn't think that it would be SO HORRIBLE for him to attend and participate in all of these. I'm going to talk with him and see if we can find a middle ground - but if he's not going to be interested in anything then he will remain uninvited. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.

You are not listening to his needs, you are insisting that these events are fun. They're fun for you, but clearly not for him. Your \"compromise\" was for him to attend two of the most stressful days or not come at all. In a comment you mentioned he said you should be grateful he's planning to come at all- that is true. You're bringing him to an enormous multi-day event where he will be surrounded by strangers trampling his boundaries, wearing out his energy reserves, forced to interact with your family and make a good impression for your benefit. He's asked if he can go with you to meet everyone and not have to participate in the games and events. THAT is the true compromise, because he's willing to put himself through emotional turmoil to meet your family, and your response thus far has been to call him a killjoy and tell him if he doesn't fully participate exactly the way the extroverts do, then he shouldn't bother going at all. \n\nThis isn't even YOUR wedding.

I have no lack of social skills, but would get slightly anxious over this, be drained for days and get no joy out of it. We should just accept not everyone is the same and respect this.", "Might be easier to do a few activities scattered over the week rather than 2 full days of immersion - I was at a 3-day (abridged and in the US bc COVID) Indian wedding last year and I needed at least one break every day to go back to my room and nap and not be around people or I would have started crying just from sensory overload.", "It\u2019s normal for millions of people. \n\nI have also been tired after being part of an Indian wedding ceremony but the memories last lifetimes and is one of those things you need to show up for.", "Tired is not the same as mentally drained. And it is not a memory of a lifetime for a lot of introverts or people with anxiety issues etc.. Not in a positve way anyway. We shouldnt force ppl.", "Creating poetry on the spot is definitely not normal. If you haven't practiced doing that then OP is just asking her husband to embarrass himself.", "Yes, then OP can look forward to a lifetime of trying to enjoy the rituals of family entirely by herself, while her husband sits home safe in his nothingness.", "Literally everyone else there is doing it. \n\nOPs husband is just socially anxious and unwilling to try.", "Yes they seem to be incompatible in this area. It is up to them to either accept this or find a middle ground (like be there, but in the background, not involved in the social poem and singing parts). It is why i looked for a man who is introverted like me. \n\nA lot of ppl dont feel being at home as nothingness btw.", "Are you sure about that? As others have pointed out its pretty unlikely that these events have 100% participation rates amongst all attending adults. It seems very reasonable to me for him to come, try the things he comfortable with and bow out for the stuff he's not. I really can't imagine a 5 day long event where literally every single adult is with each other doing the same things for all of it.", "I feel like if this wasn\u2019t OPs brother it wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal but if the husband isn\u2019t even willing to try at all I don\u2019t see the point. \n\nSitting at home out of fear of your fellow humans is definitely a life choice.", "No but most adults participate as necessary, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s not a stressful thing, it\u2019s a happy togetherness thing.", "Yeah definitely YTA.   I love my wife and there is no way I would spend the better part of every day for 5 days doing such busy interactive activities with a huge extended family.   If he's not into it, then you're asking him to be miserable.   But then suggesting on punishing him by not having him come to any of it?   Won't that be worse on your end?    Frankly I'm guessing it's party because you are worried that you'll receive small judgements from your family if he's not at every single second of every activity.   And that's shitty.\n\nBut I saw your edit and admire you for taking in the judgements and adapting!", "Damn it\u2019s like your husband isn\u2019t allowed to be an introvert. let him go and let him opt out of the extroverted activities if they make him uncomfortable. It\u2019s not the end of the world because your husband doesn\u2019t feel okay doing dances and reading poems in front of a bunch of ppl he\u2019s never met before", "Soft YTA\n\nSometimes being forced to commit to things you are not sure you will be comfortable with makes it so much worse. \n\nHe might feel great and want to, but putting demands when you KNOW it is going to be a lot overall is unfair. Esp when it is the first time. Subequent occasions, you would be more fair in uninviting if he just really doesn't need to be there... but it's really unfair IMO to impose expectations on him in a totally unknown TO HIM situation. \n\nAnd let's be honest : TWO FULL DAYS with family, including your own, but esp when NOT your own also when you'll be under the microscope a bit...  is a LOT.", "NAH, but tbh, this activities sound horrible, but thats just my opinion (and i guess your husbands, lol).", "After reading the comments, I'm gonna go with soft YTA.\n\nIt seems to me that it's not much of a cultural differences issue, but more of a personality differences issue.\n\nAllow me to share a bit of my perspective who's also an introvert, and on top of that, not a family person. My SO is the exact opposite of that, and with a family that is totally different than mine as well.\n\nHowever, he understand my struggles, my inability, and my challenges. When it comes to the habits of his side of family, he explains to me what they're like and manage MY expectations. MINE, not his. And then he goes to his family, explaining and giving them an understanding on what type of person I am, and how I might struggle to communicate and bond with them, let alone immediately jump in to any activity I might not be comfortable with. Never in our 10 years together, he expected me to simply call his mother to connect, because I don't even do that with mine.\n\nOn the other hand, as best as I could, I always try to jump in at any chance to build that relationship. Sometimes even crossing my comfort zone, but never because I was pressured to. More because I know, even when I failed, I have an SO who will not judge me but support me.\n\nYou on the other hand, not only pressured your husband but judge him as well because you can't understand his struggle. Try communicate with him, know & understand his boundaries, and find your middle ground together.", "YTA. Why did you marry him if you hate him so much? You called him a killjoy? Seriously if he shows up, let him be himself. Your ultimatum are ridiculous.  Stop downplaying his anxiety. YTA.", "Why ar you up inviting him anyway? Invites are offered or not by the couple, right?", "Oh, not just dance and improvise poetry.  He has to wholeheartedly participate, so OP gets to decide if her husband is enthusiastic enough for her.", "this isnt about you", "That's not a compromise. It's like if I told you you have to go to a nude beach with me for a day, and if you said no, I \"compromised\" that it's OK to only go for an afternoon.", "Most of these \u2018fun\u2019 activities would make me want to puke. They are NOT fun if you don\u2019t like being in the centre of attention. I\u2019d hate being forced to do this and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good compromise at all. \n\nIt\u2019s cruel to tell someone they have to do something that they are deeply uncomfortable doing or being totally uninvited. A compromise would be to go, socialise and be involved in the activities they are comfortable doing at the time. No pressure to make up a poem on the spot or dance etc", "A group dance and a poem is not small stuff. I am an extrovert and those would be a firm no to me.", "Honestly that part sounds painful and I'm not an introvert.", "Lol im an extrovert but can find myself artistically challenged when it comes to singing, dancing, drawing, & now I'll add spontaneous poem making. I might give a go but only under the influence of a few good drinks otherwise I'd be embarrassed. I mean it's 2 full days can't he socialize and observe and not be put on the spot during those activities?", "Ah, so he should just \"get over himself and enjoy\"?\n\nDo you also tell depressed people to stop being sad?", "I'm willing to show up.\n\nIf you want to force me to make a song and dance in front of people I have never seen before, then duck you and I don't want to be your friend.", "You are obviously an extrovert.  And you are judging your partner for not being 'excited to meet people'.  That makes you an AH.", "And do you have anything constructive to contribute? \ud83d\ude42", "is there anything you like about him", "Lol im an extrovert but can find myself artistically challenged when it comes to singing, dancing, drawing, & now I'll add spontaneous poem making. I might give a go but only under the influence of a few good drinks otherwise I'd be embarrassed. I mean it's 2 full days can't he socialize and observe and not be put on the spot?", "Being introverted isn\u2019t being a dick, but you sure are.", "I mean... that's a long way from their actual point, which is that he should probably get treatment for his social anxiety so that he can participate in normal events.", "Nobody is forcing you to show up. That\u2019s a choice you make for yourself. But you likewise can\u2019t force people to stay friends if you don\u2019t show up for them.", "She picked the two worst days lol there is no way I would write poetry on the spot and read it in front of my girls family.", "Those are not \"normal\" traditions for everyone.", "Here you go again.  Wholeheartedly participate, Full immersion.  You absolutely will not let your husband participate on a level that he is comfortable with.  For you, it is 100% MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY.  He *HAS* to do with at a level YOU are comfortable with or you don't want him there.  I hope he chooses to skip out of all of it.  It all sounds exhausting and you in particular.", "Can\u2019t she pick the days that don\u2019t include dancing and poetry ?", "Tell you what, instead of chopping off both your legs,  I'll only chop of your right arm.\n\n...how dare you not accept my compromise?", "That wasn\u2019t a middle ground . That was you\u2019re going to participate in all the events that make you majorly uncomfortable or not come at all. That\u2019s not being accommodating or working things out. And she wonders why he responded the way he did . She is TA in a major way", "Forced artistic performance in front of strangers is a normal event?", "I'm willing to show up.\n\nIf you want to force me to make a song and dance in front of people I have never seen before, then duck you and I don't want to be your friend.", "Idk about the traditions, that's my fault. It depends on the person, I guess others could have fun writing poetry and reading it. Could be a way to bond with them, if you do it well.", "> Tell you what, instead of chopping off both your legs, I'll only chop of your right arm.\n\nIf attending a wedding and losing a limb are equally painful, then uninviting him to the entire wedding is the only correct solution.", "She made accomdations for him and have him options. She only asked him to participate at the minimum level required or to stay home. It is rude if he shows up and doesn't participate in the traditional family events.\n\nShowing respect for his wife's culture in this manner is not a herculean task. Yeah, he could embarrass himself a little, but everyone there is embarrassing themselves a little. You think he is the only one who can't come up with a poem on the spot? Being an introvert is not an excuse. If he has anxiety and panic attacks then he just shouldn't go b/c no part of the event will be OK for him.\n\nSo he has his options. Participate in the minimum required or don't go. OP is not an AH for these being the options.", "That is accomdating. 3 days v. 5 of these events.\n\nIt will be insulting to he family and cause issues if he hides away. Him just showing for the wedding is not a workable compromise. \n\nHe doesn't have to go so he shouldn't go. He will be ruining the trip for OP and is going to put a cloud over the wedding.", "Absolutely, yes. Poetry, singing, painting, even the occasional sculpture are mandatory family events here. I know some people don't have such a cultural background, and that's fine, but it's two very minor events and he's also Indian so it shouldn't come as a shock that she's asking him to participate.", "Ok so it\u2019s normal for millions but it\u2019s also not normal for millions I don\u2019t really get your point because all that is relevant to this is that it is not normal to OP\u2019s husband", "How about, and I know tips might sound crazy, but hear me out here, *he gets to attend the wedding but not participate in the fun extremity chopping games?*", "That's not a middle ground.\n\nIf I told you you should meet my friends for a sauna day, but they are going to a nude sauna. However since I know you don't want to be naked in front of strangers, you can come for 2 hours only.\nThat's not an accommodation.\n\nAccommodation would be let's maybe not go to a naked sauna [meet the family at not the wedding] or at least let you wear a swimsuit [go to the wedding but not be forced to participate in mandatory \"fun\" activities].\n\nAlso I'm Finnish in this example so don't go \"being naked in a sauna is not a part of culture\"", "So then he doesn\u2019t go and his wife is embarrassed in front of her family.", "From my perspective, she IS offering the swimsuit, but her husband can't stand any level of nudity (including others) for any length of time. In that instance, If it were me I would understand it is part of your culture and that I'm not mature enough to handle nudity, so I wouldn't go and understand why you are going. That is the most mature option for the husband to take. \n\nAnd FYI, my inability to deal w/ nudity at all for any length of time should also be factored in to how I'm viewed by your friends/family. If they think I'm uptight and have hang-ups about something pretty normal and natural, they would be right.\n\nOP wants to and should be attending all of the wedding. There is absolutely no reason why she shouldn't and it would be rude to her family to participate in all of the events. It would be rude for husband him to just show for the ceremony and would hurt his relationship with her family. If the husband can't do the bare minimum of events, he shouldn't go and ruin the event for OP and put stress on her and her family."]}
