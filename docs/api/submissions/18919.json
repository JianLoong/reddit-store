One of my friends brought her boyfriend, Mike. I usually don\u2019t mind, the more the merrier, but I\u2019m not a fan of his. He\u2019s kind of a dick and blames it on his autism. But idk, I\u2019m not really educated on all that.\n\nAnyways, my sister was playing in their play room but my brother was bored and wanted attention. He\u2019s really into having abs and muscles and being strong rn and he does gymnastics and all that so he was doing cartwheels and stuff till he got a little dizzy. He sat on my lap and started showing me his arms and asked if his muscles got bigger. He\u2019s 8, so he still has little arms but I said \u201comg they\u2019re totally getting bigger\u201d \n\nMike randomly interrupted to go \u201cnah man you got noodle arms\u201d \n\nMy brother didn\u2019t really catch what he said so he just brushed him off but I was upset. Discreetly told him to stfu. But Mike was all like \u201cwhat? I\u2019m just telling the truth, he has to do a lot more than that to get some real muscles, noodle ass kid.\u201d \n\nI reminded him that my brother is 8 but he said that his age is irrelevant here. \n\nMy brother then decided to show us another gymnastics move, I think it\u2019s a round off? But he did it and we all clapped for him. Except of course Mike. He went \u201cthat was anti climatic.\u201d He continued with, \u201cno offense but this is the most unimpressive kid ever. Get outta here with ur skinny ass\u201d \n\nI was honestly so pissed off at this point that I sarcastically said \u201cI\u2019d like to see your fat ass try to do what he did.\u201d\n\nHe immediately got upset and his girlfriend gasped like I said something outrageous. Where was her horror when her bf was insulting my kid brother? But Mike got all up in my face about being a bitch before leaving. His girlfriend told me that I went too far esp since I know he has autism and that she can\u2019t believe I fat shamed him when he isn\u2019t even that fat. \u201cBesides, he isn\u2019t wrong AND ur brother\u2019s annoying.\u201d My other friend that was there told me that she thinks he was rude but I did too much.", "created_utc": 1685857573, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1402qkp/aita_for_fatshaming_my_friends_autistic_boyfriend/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
