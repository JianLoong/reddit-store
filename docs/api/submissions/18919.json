People like that rarely are worth keeping around. You obviously don't have to kick them out of your life immediately, but you definitely need to sit down with your friend and tell them it's unacceptable for them to bully a child like that and until they learn how to be respectful to him, neither of them is welcome at your place anymore. After that, the trash will probably take itself out.\n\nYour brother is only 8, stuff like that can really knock him down and could eventually cause long term insecurity issues. I'd definitely talk to your parents as well, just so they're aware of the situation and can support your brother if he's still upset. You handled this well.

I think it would be worth doing a little research to learn more about autism to find out a more appropriate response. It could look something like pulling him aside and saying \u201chey man, I know you\u2019re just trying to be honest with my bro, but you\u2019re shooting down his confidence and it\u2019s unnecessary.
