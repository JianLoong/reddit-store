You obviously don't have to kick them out of your life immediately, but you definitely need to sit down with your friend and tell them it's unacceptable for them to bully a child like that and until they learn how to be respectful to him, neither of them is welcome at your place anymore.

The OP 's only responsibility at that time was in protecting her brother and getting them out of her house. What actions should she have taken that you would consider \"a little bit of leniency?\"", "Being autistic doesn't mean you get to disrespect boundaries and insult an 8 year old for jokes.", "Actually, no. If I\u2019m remembering correctly, OP stated that Mike has a history of acting like an AH and then using his autism as an excuse or a shield to hide behind so he can continue his bad behavior with no consequences. Sadly too many others who are neurodivergent also tend to do this. But having a neurodivergency does not mean a person doesn\u2019t know the difference between right or wrong. In some situations they may miss out on social cues, yes, and accidentally say something that could come off as bullying or harassment when that was not their intention just because they can be incredibly blunt with their statements, but that wasn\u2019t what happened here. Mike knew he was insulting this 8 year old. His word choices prove that. Mike didn\u2019t care. He knew what stop meant and what no meant and he still kept insulting the kid. He doesn\u2019t get a pass or leniency for that.\n\nI\u2019m someone who is neurodivergent and who has quite a few friends who are as well, between autism and other ND disorders, so I know what I\u2019m talking about.", "Naw he can get bent.", "This is completely irrelevant in reference to an impressionable child. Setting a good example is important. You don't have to pretend nothing happened, but you can confront someone without being a bad example for a child.", "What part of my comment makes you think I disagree with this premise?", "Nah, bro, strong and flexible people are better at gymnastics. Some of them are thin, some of them are solid chunks of muscle. And all of them are amazing!", "\ud83d\udeab", "If you ever end up in a physical confrontation with him, just keep in mind that fatties tend to have bad knees so oblique/leg kicks are your friend.", "He can dish it, but he can't take it.\nHe was bodyshaming an 8 year old kid.", "I'm autistic. You are so right. This is just being a dick", "THIS", "Yes, this exactly. \n\nIt's possible he didn't realize he was being insulting (autism does often come with difficulties reading tone and autistic people often copy the behavior of others to mask and seem 'normal' without truly grasping the nuance of thos sort of thing). \n\nHowever, even if that was the case, he should've changed his tone after he was told he was being insulting. The fact that he was told clearly and didn't listen and/or care, is what makes him the asshole and OP NTA.", "OP calling Mike \"Fat\" as an insult isn't nice (Neither is using fat as an insult to anyone) but it's not nearly as bad as what Mike was saying. Two wrongs don't make a right either.   \n\n\nYou make a good point that OP's brother shouldn't find it acceptable to use the word fat as an insult. \n\nHopefully OPs brother will understand that.   \n\n\nAlthough I don't agree that OP calling Mike fat was implying that skinny people must be better. Or I suppose I didn't see it that way.  \n\n\nI'm on the skinnier side and I can't do a cartwheel or round offs to save my life Heh. I'm not flexible enough.", "Solid chunks of muscle aren't fat! Fat wobbles.", "OP please don't get in a physical confrontation with this guy.  If he doesn't have the filter to keep from picking on an 8 yo, then I doubt he has the governor to keep from hurting someone smaller.", "I am a fatty. Can confirm knees are the weak spot", "Maybe in their 40s and 50s, lol, not a young person unless they're crazy obese", "Knees are a weak spot on anyone. But yes, knees, ankles, wrists.", "I feel like you're not around children very much.", "Yes just because his limitations may be his laziness and weight not all fat people are incapable of doing fancy exercises. I literally just watch a guy about four times my size rock a stage flipping and doing all kinds of gymnastics my skinny ass would never imagine myself trying let alone being as graceful as he was... then there's the other guy who was doing the trend where you do the leg spiral count stret h thing... I would have made it about half way, old boy made it all the way down the spiral. And then Lizzo running across that stage and doing choreography.... I could never and I know alot of skinny people who could never as well... \n\nDoesn't make it okay to shame anyone based on their size but don't feel like it automatically points to the opposite shape/size being better.... but also I'm lazy when it comes to exercising... I just have a super high metabolism.", "No, a bad filter would be saying \"that's basic gymnastics though\", or \"but your skinny\", not this. That's just being a dick. Signed, your local neighborhood autisticman", "I don\u2019t have children myself but I\u2019m regularly with my niece and nephew as well as some cousins etc. \n\nWhat makes you think that I\u2019m not?", "Because with kids it\u2019s okay to exaggerate things that they\u2019re excited about.. the boy obviously wants to get stronger, OP telling him \u201cnah you small\u201d would most likely discourage him from continuing working out or he\u2019d resent her for putting him down. It\u2019s actually the same for adults but we can understand when someone is being helpful vs critical. Kids can\u2019t.", "I would say that exactly the opposite is true. If he is told that he\u2019s already as strong as he wants to be then he won\u2019t continue to work out and won\u2019t ever actually get there. Also he might simply look in the mirror and realise OP was lying to him. Then he\u2019ll feel crushed.", "But she didn\u2019t tell him that he\u2019s as strong as he wants to be, she told him that he\u2019s getting bigger which is technically true and is a confirmation to him that he\u2019s on the right path.\n\nRegarding the mirror, kids that grow in a supportive environment don\u2019t see things for what they are, they see what they think they are and he sees himself as a strong boy with strong muscles which can really motivate him in the long run. If he grows up thinking this, when he\u2019s old enough, he\u2019d be focused on his goal rather than his current situation. This is what support does to a person. If OP would\u2019ve put him down or was technical with him like you say she should, he would also not see things for what they are, he\u2019d see himself as small and weak and beat himself up for it and have no belief in himself. I say it from experience :) words have a lot of weight for little kids."]}
