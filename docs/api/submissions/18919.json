One of my friends brought her boyfriend, Mike. I usually don\u2019t mind, the more the merrier, but I\u2019m not a fan of his. He\u2019s kind of a dick and blames it on his autism. But idk, I\u2019m not really educated on all that.\n\nAnyways, my sister was playing in their play room but my brother was bored and wanted attention. He\u2019s really into having abs and muscles and being strong rn and he does gymnastics and all that so he was doing cartwheels and stuff till he got a little dizzy. He sat on my lap and started showing me his arms and asked if his muscles got bigger. He\u2019s 8, so he still has little arms but I said \u201comg they\u2019re totally getting bigger\u201d \n\nMike randomly interrupted to go \u201cnah man you got noodle arms\u201d \n\nMy brother didn\u2019t really catch what he said so he just brushed him off but I was upset. Discreetly told him to stfu. But Mike was all like \u201cwhat? I\u2019m just telling the truth, he has to do a lot more than that to get some real muscles, noodle ass kid.\u201d \n\nI reminded him that my brother is 8 but he said that his age is irrelevant here. \n\nMy brother then decided to show us another gymnastics move, I think it\u2019s a round off? But he did it and we all clapped for him. Except of course Mike. He went \u201cthat was anti climatic.\u201d He continued with, \u201cno offense but this is the most unimpressive kid ever. Get outta here with ur skinny ass\u201d \n\nI was honestly so pissed off at this point that I sarcastically said \u201cI\u2019d like to see your fat ass try to do what he did.\u201d\n\nHe immediately got upset and his girlfriend gasped like I said something outrageous. Where was her horror when her bf was insulting my kid brother? But Mike got all up in my face about being a bitch before leaving. His girlfriend told me that I went too far esp since I know he has autism and that she can\u2019t believe I fat shamed him when he isn\u2019t even that fat. \u201cBesides, he isn\u2019t wrong AND ur brother\u2019s annoying.\u201d My other friend that was there told me that she thinks he was rude but I did too much.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI may be uneducated but I\u2019m not stupid. If you\u2019re going to dm me anti-autistic people crap I\u2019m not going to reply because I do not agree with your horrible remarks. My issue is not an excuse for people to be discriminatory towards those with autism. \n\nLike many people are saying in the comments, Mike is not a representation of those with autism.

People like that rarely are worth keeping around. You obviously don't have to kick them out of your life immediately, but you definitely need to sit down with your friend and tell them it's unacceptable for them to bully a child like that and until they learn how to be respectful to him, neither of them is welcome at your place anymore. After that, the trash will probably take itself out.\n\nYour brother is only 8, stuff like that can really knock him down and could eventually cause long term insecurity issues. I'd definitely talk to your parents as well, just so they're aware of the situation and can support your brother if he's still upset. You handled this well.

It could look something like pulling him aside and saying \u201chey man, I know you\u2019re just trying to be honest with my bro, but you\u2019re shooting down his confidence and it\u2019s unnecessary.

It's all very black-and-white to him. So, when you confronted him about it, it's very possible that all he saw was a teenage girl \"coming at him\" all angry for no reason. This automatically put him on the defensive, hence why he saw no reason to clap at your brother's \"anticlimactic\" round off. Still, retorting back at him with MORE insults is just stooping to his level. \n\nIn the future, I'd recommend not having your friend over if she's going to bring Mike with her.", ">I\u2019m not a fan of his.

I mostly experience this as having really small buckets I categorize things in (compared to neurotypical people). So while I can find patterns between things in the same bucket (often easily), it is a lot harder to connect things in different buckets together. I find getting outside perspective often helps to make the connections between separate buckets, so by talking with friends or a therapist for example.\n\nThis can lead to people going \"Why have you still not learned that?\" \"I've told you a million times\", while I seriously do not understand how the situation was connected to anything previous.

But it grinds my gears so fucking hard when people baby autistic folks (most often it's autistic men, too) and dismiss a lack of consideration as a lack of ability.\n\nNot inherently understanding social norms does not stop you from learning how to manage that lack of understanding. I say this as an autistic person who has put effort into learning to manage my disability so I don't make everyone's lives (mine included) harder than they need to be.\n\nBlack and white thinking doesn't stop you from learning there's a time and place to blurt out the truth. Literal thinking doesn't stop you from realizing that there's more to this situation than you understand, and thinking that maybe you ought to ask someone about what's going on before you stick your foot in it. It certainly doesn't stop you from shutting up after someone explicitly tells you to *stop talking.*\n\nAutism (the kind Mike seems to have) does not stop people from taking accountability for their mistakes. It does not excuse them from learning to be considerate of others. And it does not prevent them from putting effort into being kind over being correct.", "Nah, some ppl need their own medicine to leaen6what they do is wrong, how others feel. And. If you tell a child that their efforts are not paying off yet, they might lose interesr in it all together. Itd better sometimes to give them whit elies to encourage them.", "I was thinking the same. I\u2019m autistic and would never say anything like that. My cousin is also autistic and he would never say anything like that. \n\nI know one autistic person who would say something like that, but he would never say it to a child, he would say it to people his own age, and the people who know him know that stuff like that from him is a way of showing endearment.", "Exactly. I could understand if Mike had been confused by everyone\u2019s high praise of the kid and said, \u201cI hardly see any muscles on his arms.\u201d \n\nBut once everyone else continues to praise the kid, you just figure there\u2019s something going on that\u2019s just beyond you and you either go with it or sit silently and wait for a conversation topic you feel comfortable contributing to or start a new conversation.", "Ah yes because we all love a fb professional \ud83d\ude43\n\nHow he was acting is not typical of autism. It is typical of someone who has hidden behind their diagnosis, as the other person said, and expects to get away with everything. And your comment is *exactly* why that happens.\n\nBeing on the spectrum doesnt mean you cant take accountability for being rude.", "That\u2019s an abuser move\u2014to isolate.", "Lol bless you", "Right.  My youngest son is on the spectrum, and he would never denigrate anyone. To their face or behind their back. It makes me mad when people use autism to try to excuse bad behavior.", "Just don't call him a big man. He doesn't like that", "The adult was being fat shamed. The kid was being skinny shamed. It is a sorry excuse to make the little brother feel bad, but I 'm also not wrong.", "That's why you are not an asshole. We all upset people some times, intent is important but so is how you react to it being pointed out.", "Ok? But thin people are still going to tend to be better at gymnastics compared to fat people, why did super fit Simone biles Olympic athlete level muscular looking gymnasts come into the picture lmao", "I am autistic. You are talking down to someone with *first hand experience* of the spectrum just because you think your fb groups teach you better.", "That\u2019s how you know the \u201ccan\u2019t control it\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know it was wrong\u201d arguments are bullshit. Because otherwise why haven\u2019t they attacked their boss? Or the guy who bumped in to them at the bar? Or literally anyone else that they encounter who inconvenienced or upset them in their day to day life?", "Lol no I'm saying how I have seen not just MY SONs, present but how other parents have seen theirs present.  No 2 Autistic people are the same.  Example:  my older son presents different to my younger son.   He can be very blunt, he doesn't get it can come across rude.  I have to wait until he is receptive and then word it correctly for him to understand.", "Exactly!They can control it very well until they 'don't have to'.\n'Street angel,house devil' is an old saying.", "Nope", "Understanding social cues can be a big part of being autistic (I struggle a lot with it) but not everyone struggles the same way. I\u2019m going to try to explain this the best I can but I apologize if it doesn\u2019t come out right. \n\nSome people with autism as I\u2019m sure you know are infantilized their whole lives. They can be completely capable of taking care of themselves but since they are autistic they are seen as children. When that happens it the autistic person isn\u2019t learning how to actually behave because when they say \u201cyou\u2019re an unimpressive kid\u201d they\u2019re brushed off as not understanding. The way to get them to is to call them out and explain. \n\nYou\u2019ll hear a lot that someone can\u2019t be autistic because they\u2019re smart, or kind, or whatever. It\u2019s just the way it presents though. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to be teaching autistic kids from the start that they don\u2019t think they can just get away with how they act.", "Thank you, that is really useful!\n\nI think that the more we learn how the other group functions the better we will be able to co-exist peacefully and in understanding.", "NTA - fat shaming is totally legitimate", "This. So many people do not realize that you can body shame skinny people too. The double standard here is gross and that friend is not her friend. NTA", "Thank you for explaining a common autistic experience of trying to fit in. It is accurate. \n\nIt\u2019s possible Mike is self-diagnosed but I\u2019m guessing he didn\u2019t do years worth of self-assessment tests, research, and introspection to come to that conclusion. I think, as you suggested, he just found it a convenient label to use to say whatever he wants without consequence.", "Yeah, autistic people aren\u2019t inherently assholes, but autism will make any assholery pop in 4K.", "Giving someone a taste of their own medicine means you have to act just as bad as them. Why would you do that to yourself? \n\nSooner or later the child needs to learn that it takes time for efforts to pay off. Why not start now?", "Yep! Ik you arnt talking to me. But I fuck up my words frequently due to my autism and lack of social cues. When I\u2019m made aware I apologize.", "\ud83d\ude18", "Exactly. Neurodivergence makes us far less likely to just blurt out whatever rude shit comes to mind, instead we'd be quietly sitting there trying to figure out if everyone is jokng or just being hyperbolic or what, LOL.", "Being fat shamed wasn\u2019t used as an excuse for skinny shaming. The skinny shaming happened first."]}
