His pay barely covered his rent so my income supplemented his expenses and lifestyle. He was working to get his CDL and I wanted to help him accomplish that. We worked on ourselves and set boundaries. Our relationship was going in a very good direction.\n\nMy dad (76) will now be all alone if I move out. I talk to my husband about moving here. Get a better job, help fix up the house, we will save money, and continue to work on our marriage. He agrees it is a good plan.\n\nCouple weeks before moving in he tells me he wants to start his own business cleaning cars. It is out of the blue and caused a fight, thats not what we agreed on. I come around   and agree to help. He gets here and doesn't want to clean cars anymore but also doesnt look for jobs. Says he is still getting paychecks from his previous job, that he worked his ass off, and he wants to treat it like a little vacation. I don't think this is smart, it usually takes a couple weeks to find and start a new job so why not send resumes? He basically says I am being unsupportive. This doesn't feel right, but I want to show my trust and support. 2-3 weeks go by, his checks stop coming in. Still not looking for a job.\n\nHe begins spending most days playing video games. I work from home and am  aware of what is going on. I drop hints and ask for help, but thats not working. Then, I start getting angry. Tell him he needs to get serious about applying for jobs. He pushes back and I FLIP out. Over a month since he arrived and he finally sends maybe 3 resumes.\n\nNot long after, he wants to be a streamer or youtuber for this video game. Asks to spend $1500 for equipment. Says I should financially support him so he can commit to streaming and one day I won't have to work. I am still angry, tell him to get a job or leave. He refuses and tries to reason with me. I eventually calm down, think about it, come around yet again.\n\nWeeks go by, he isn't streaming. Doesn't even have notes or plans laid out. So many things feel wrong and we are fighting alot. I feel deceived. He is blaming his lack of motivation on me for being mean, unsupportive, not trusting him, starting fights, ect. Our relationship is back down the toilet.\n\nI have been the sole provider for 5 months. Our bank accounts weren't great to begin with and now the situation is bad. I was telling him what was being spent and the balances for awhile, but kind of gave up. If he cared he would ask or look himself.\n\nAITA for not supporting my husband's dreams and telling him to get a job or leave?", "created_utc": 1697137374, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176enpl/aita_for_not_supporting_my_husbands_dreams_and/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sorry, OP but it seems this marriage has run it's course.  I would say get out now while the gettin' is good.  Wait any longer and it's going to take that much more time to get out of the hole he is digging for all of you.", "NTA. You are right to feel duped. Also, stop caving to harebrained ideas!

He's purposely bringing up different ridiculous plans because he doesn't want to work/doesn't know what he wants to do with his life, and the more ridiculous and out of the blue the plan sounds, the higher the chances that you'll react negatively and he gets to use that reaction to manipulate you further. \n\nPersonally I think your marriage is over. He doesn't respect you and he doesn't care the impact his actions have on your shared finances and your emotional wellbeing. That's a dealbreaker for me. \n\nBut at the very least you need to try therapy separately and possibly as a couple. And separate again in the meantime.

You wouldn't work for a company for 5 months without a paycheck, so why would you support your husband without a paycheck from him.

You need to re-evaluate how much it's costing you and decide what's your breaking point and when you're going to focus on taking care of your needs and quit making it all about him, because he's doing nothing but draining you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She him the door.", "It wasn't unusual for him to talk about multiple different careers when he was in his 20s. Sometimes it made me anxious, but I understood that he was trying to figure things out. For awhile he wanted to start his own landscaping business and had a couple clients outside of his day job, but stopped doing it. I don't remember why. Then talked about being a firefighter, didnt pursue that. Then he wanted to be a mechanic and chased it. Got a great job and was a mechanic for 4 years, tons of opportunities, he (mostly) loved it. Except having to go high up in bucket trucks because he is afraid of heights. Then Covid hit and that changed everything. He wanted to change careers again and be an equipment operator, which I have whole heartedly supported. Hence why I supplemented him getting his CDL. Even spent $2K to rent an excavator for a bit so that he could use it on our land to get more seat time. Also to further stoke his fire and passion. Video games seem to be ruining everything! He was right there! So close to getting what he has been working for since 2021. I don't understand \u2639\ufe0f and I'm angry about it", "Nothing wrong with video games (I certainly play a whole lot of them), but his idea of becoming a Let's Play influencer is unrealistic at best.  For starters, the amount of followers and donations needed to the pay of minimum wage job is a lot. I can't stress that enough.  You need a sizable fan base.  You even gave him 1.5k to get \"equipment\" for streaming.  Which sounds a lot like an excuse to get a mid range gaming computer to make your games look a little prettier.\n\nWhile I understand you want to support your husband, at some point he needs to figure out what he wants to do with his life (he's about to hit 40).  You've bankrolled him many times.  Hell, I wish someone would pay 2 grand to rent me an excavator.  Oh, the fun I would have with that.  If he paid his own things, I guarantee he wouldn't be swapping between so many different ideas all the time.  He would start to form a more concrete plan since he would know the blood and sweat that was required for the money he's spending. But as it stands now, he's like a 7th grader trying a bunch of different electives to figure out what he/she enjoys.  Which is fine for a 7th grader, but not for someone who hasn't been in middle school for 30 years.", "I think the streaming thing is just an excuse to get away with things. I have a friend that work full-time, stream to a small community on the side, and have committed relationships with their significant others. They are probably some of the hardest working people I know."]}
