She\u2019s still not convinced and insists it\u2019s gross. As for washing it when she\u2019s not there that\u2019s not really an option because when she\u2019s not in class she\u2019s almost always in the room and a lot of our classes line up time wise. Even if I used a shower cap she\u2019d still know I\u2019m not washing my hair.

So that why I said that once a week is fine.", "Like I said I still shower even if I\u2019m not washing my hair. It doesn\u2019t stink as my hair always smells the same way if no scented shampoo (no clue why, might be something in my genes) and it\u2019s not a bad smell.", "NTA.\n\nSo a hairdresser told me once that sometimes those flakes are also from using too much shampoo & not rinsing all of it out. Then they see those flakes & buy anti-dandruff shampoo which is harsher & it makes it worse!\n\n It was supposed to be roughly a 1euro coin amount on the top of the head & massage in. Then rinse it all out, this moves oils & dead skin etc off the scalp into the hair. Then you repeat (it'll be foamier this time) & this washes all the stuff out of your hair. \nAlso yes, use cooler water.\n\nDepends also on your water hardness, soft water will need far less shampoo & lots more rinsing compared to hard water. \n\nHow often you wash your hair can also depend on your hair type! Mines very straight & oily, so I can go 3 days without washing it, I can push it to 4 if I braid it but it does usually look oily by then. \nThat might be the hot water use, but it's Ireland, it's damp, cold & rainy & I'm not giving up hot water even for hair health!! XD", ">I did go in depth about why I need to do this with her.

If washing your hair less frequently is a recommended approach to address your dry scalp issue, and you've explained this to your roommate, it may be a matter of her needing to better understand the situation.  \nWhile you've been considerate of her concerns, you also need to prioritize your own comfort and health. You could consider discussing the issue with a residential advisor or housing staff who can mediate the situation and provide guidance on how to handle this roommate conflict. They may be able to help you find a resolution that respects both your needs and your roommate's feelings.  \nRemember that compromise and understanding are key in resolving such conflicts, but your health and well-being should also be a top priority.", "Like I said, unless it smells, then it's fine.\n\nHave my NTA", "NTA, your roommate is ridiculous. Many, many people, especially those with curly or coily hair cannot wash their hair more often than once or twice a week because it gets too dry and that type of hair needs the natural oils to be healthy. \n\nBecause it seems like she is refusing to believe you when you say that it is recommended, I'd go petty if it was me, just to prove my point... go online and find reputable sources where it specifically recommends less washing/no washing, print them and put them up all over your room. Or just keep asking her when she became a professional hair stylist and how she somehow knows soooooo much better than literally every ethnic hair stylist ever. She's an idiot and I'd drive it home until she gets the point. LOL but I have curly hair and this greatly annoys me and I'd go petty the whole way so maybe this isn't great advice.", "NTA - Just a tip - my fiance has the same thing. Clean hair, not oily. He uses Nizoral and it really helps.", "Nta - you can tell your roommate that you didn't ask for her opinion. Stop being too nice, she's being a jerk to you.\n\nGive a shot to massaging your scalp with coconut oil 2/3 hours before hair wash. I was skeptical but gosh no more itching!", "NTA. You mention that your hair is jet black-- black hair sometimes has much lower porosity than hair of other colors, largely depending on genetics. Porosity refers to how well your hair *absorbs* things-- which includes both products, and contaminants like sweat. Hair with lower porosity should be washed less frequently than hair with higher porosity, because it gets less dirty to begin with and also using products on it too frequently can cause the product to build up on the outside instead of getting absorbed. So even outside the issue with your scalp, it might be more suited to your hair type to wash less frequently anyways.\n\nYou can do a few different tests to determine the porosity of your hair, or just observe how it seems to react to products. But I suspect that if your hairdresser is telling you to wash less frequently, she probably has observed that your hair has low enough porosity for that to be an option for you. \n\nIf you do have low-porosity hair, you might benefit from hair care tutorials by Black women (who often have low-porosity hair) and/or hair care routines intended for people with curly hair (which is also often low-porosity). Even if your hair isn't textured in the same way, the porosity level might be the same and so you could still use some of the same techniques. I don't know much about Black hair care (I'm very fair and have fairly porous hair myself), but I do know that they have techniques for things like moisturizing the scalp with oils and protecting the hair from getting dirty while exercising, which might help you manage how frequently you need to wash your hair. \n\nYour roommate is probably speaking based on her own experience. I'd wager that she has more porous hair and her own hair thus needs washing more frequently than yours or it becomes noticeably greasy, so she can't imagine your hair NOT being greasy with less frequent washing. But I wouldn't call this a N A H because people with different hair types shouldn't use their own experiences as a basis for critiquing others, especially because there's often a racial component to the issue.", "NTA \n\nAs a fellow jet black/white flake member, this shit is mad annoying. I also wash once a week/ every other week. My hair is THICC. Like it\u2019s hot all the time so if I start to wash daily my shit is dry and annoying. Use coconut oil to lightly oil the scalp. Make sure you get regular cuts too! It helped a lot for mine.", "NTA Your hair is your choice, but do look into what shampoo you are using. Might be a good and expensive brand, but sometimes those things are scum and actually have trash ingredients! I would look at Mane and Tail shampoo, don't let the name fool you, it's for people!

Anti-dandruff on dry scalp actually makes it worse because anti-dandruff is meant to make your hair less oily as dandruff is caused by excessive oil, and if you put that on dry scalp it\u2019s taking away even more of the oil that you need to keep your scalp moist. Thank you though.", "Yeah if it isn\u2019t a smell-centered hygiene issue, I would INSIST she explain why she has a problem with it and how exactly it affects her. If her response is basically \u201cew gross,\u201d she needs to MYOB while you sort your treatment out. Good luck OP!!", "It\u2019s really non of your roommate\u2019s business, but would just wetting it in the shower work for you - just to shut her up?  I get it if the water is enough to make it dry, so it might not work, but it was a thought I had.", "That whole pores thing is a myth, your body doesn't have the capability to open them up like that.", "I've got a hand- held sprayer in my shower now. Maybe it's time to try again!", "You asked what the roommate was doing - I was just offering a potential explanation because that's why I wash mine everyday! :)", "> That might be the hot water use, but it's Ireland, it's damp, cold & rainy & I'm not giving up hot water even for hair health!! XD\n\nI managed this by having the room warm instead. Turn on the radiator before getting in and shut doors and windows. Easier to have a non-lobster shower when you're getting out to a warm roam and toasty towel. \n\nI warm myself up a little too. Something small like a cup of tea or sweeping the floor before showering. Gets your temp up enough that you can turn the shower down a notch. Over a few months I went from needing a 10 to a 4/5 feeling comfortable.\n\nHelped my hair a lot but also my skin. Had no idea how dry my skin was (it always felt smooth) until I stopped blasting it with hot water. Another benefit is when you have an achy day and *really* need the hot water on your muscles, you can turn it up! Doesn't work as well if it's always on high to start with.\n\nRemember to open the window/turn the fan on when you're done though! Our cold, damp islands just love mould.", "Could it be serrisis? Completely wrong spelling but hopefully you can work it out from what I typed...try nizoral.", "I have the same issue and I only wash my hair once a week. I can go up to 2 weeeks in the winter and the hard water doesn't help either. I rub oil into my scalp the night before I wash my hair to help with the dryness and the peeling skin, especially in winter. \n\nI also wear a hair cover when sleeping and doing anything that might get my hair dirty. Your roommate is just ignorant.", "Just saying, I also don\u2019t have \u201cdandruff\u201d but I do have dry flaky scalp as well. Dandruff shampoo still does wonders. Cant use any other shampoo. If you haven\u2019t tried it might as well see.", "I used to have those same flakes, I ended up switching to sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner and it cleared right up! Not sure if that applies to your situation but if you use products with sulfates it's worth a shot.", "I had the same issue despite already only washing hair once a week\u2014head & shoulders dry scalp care shampoo fixed it for me, so it may be worth a shot if you don\u2019t already use a special shampoo", "While true that pores don't \"open\" from hot water, the heat does help remove excess oil, dirt, and grime trapped in your pores. I always assume that's what people mean when they talk about it \"opening up\" their pores.", "Our heating only works if we make a fire (On the back boiler & immersion system!), so funny enough the rainy cold days of winter it's more usual to have a warm bathroom in the evening. \n\nNow I do have hot water but not lobster hot (I remember my brother literally coming out pink, we worried he was scalding himself!), I did find out I had dry skin (assumed it was oily) & I have a lovely soft face oil for after showers that keeps my skin moisturised. Yeah about the damp, there's often a yell of did ye open the window/leave the door open after the shower! XD", "Ah psoriasis - my uncle has that and autoimmune disorders run in my family. It doesn\u2019t look red or patchy like in pictures on Google but it\u2019s a possibility.", "I\u2019ve tried it, doesn\u2019t really work for me", "I\u2019ve tried head and shoulders. That\u2019s more designed for actual dandruff and makes dry scalp worse.", "I'd buy that thinking if they didn't also say that they end it with cold water to close the pores.", "I think they're referring to seborrheic dermatitis. It definitely matches your description. Would highly recommend Nizoral and r/SebDerm", "Not head & shoulders dandruff shampoo. Head & shoulders \u201cdry scalp care\u201d shampoo. Different products", "Oh man looking at that on Google that\u2019s a perfect match especially with some skin itchiness and redness I have. Thank you so much.", "Mine are a lot smaller than in some of the pictures though but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just variance and Google showing the most dramatic examples. Sorry I keep replying lol.", "Concur on Nizoral.  I also tend towards scalp issues that aren't dandruff and it really works.\n\nThey also just came out with some kind of scalp exfoliating treatment.", "Ah. I assumed psoriasis because psoriasis actually can cause really bad itchy hair flakes and turn the skin red. This is interesting though, thanks.", "I'm glad someone more educated is able to explain what my brain fails to lol. Thank you.", "No no you're good! I'm glad you might have some answers! There's quite a few products out there for us like Nizoral, Selsun Blue, and MCT oil. I'm virtually symptom free now. Join usssssss r/SebDerm", "It doesn't really matter why or what it's called.  You're still showering, and this is what makes you more comfortable.  Your hair is, in fact, clean enough that your roommate didn't even notice it wasn't being washed daily until she saw you get out of the shower multiple times.\n\nThis would be a different issue if her concerns came after sitting next to or behind you.  This would be a different issue if get concerns came after finding bugs in your room.  That's not what happened.  She saw you do something different than what she does and decided to try to make you feel badly about it.", "Oh that's really cool. Have you tried MCT oil? I'm jealous of all the people that get amazing results. I have an allergy to the entire palm family \ud83d\udc80", "I would have thought that too, but I don't think Nizoral works for psoriasis. It specifically kills the yeast responsible for seb derm. (It looks like Nizoral also makes a psoriasis shampoo but it's got a special label and it's not their main product?) I'm crossing my fingers you have seb derm because it's WAY more easily treatable than psoriasis. I think you should get regular Nizoral off Amazon and see what happens. It shouldn't help *unless* you have seb derm, so that can narrow it down. Make sure you let it sit on your scalp for 10 minutes before rinsing it out.", "I wouldn't say educated - more like personally experienced via desperation. Also, tbh with you, I can't spell seborrheic dermatitis without autocorrect or copy/pasting from somewhere. I don't know why they have to name them all like this \ud83d\udc80 It's ridiculous.", "So OP\u2019s hair issues sound a lot like what I\u2019m also dealing with. Where can I buy these products?", "Oh I think we all agree that OP is NTA. I only think the type of scalp problem matters because different products can make a world of difference when it comes to comfort and self-confidence. Having an itchy scalp *SUCKS*.", "Topically? No, my hair is too fine for that. It's naturally dry, too, so it's a balancing act to find products that are moisturizing but not heavy!", "I\u2019ll definitely try it, thank you!", "I buy my fiance the pink bottle of nizoral and he says he has the psoriasis (why do they make it so hard to spell)"]}
