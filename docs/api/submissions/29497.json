She\u2019s still not convinced and insists it\u2019s gross. As for washing it when she\u2019s not there that\u2019s not really an option because when she\u2019s not in class she\u2019s almost always in the room and a lot of our classes line up time wise. Even if I used a shower cap she\u2019d still know I\u2019m not washing my hair.

So that why I said that once a week is fine.", "Like I said I still shower even if I\u2019m not washing my hair. It doesn\u2019t stink as my hair always smells the same way if no scented shampoo (no clue why, might be something in my genes) and it\u2019s not a bad smell.", "NTA.\n\nSo a hairdresser told me once that sometimes those flakes are also from using too much shampoo & not rinsing all of it out. Then they see those flakes & buy anti-dandruff shampoo which is harsher & it makes it worse!\n\n It was supposed to be roughly a 1euro coin amount on the top of the head & massage in. Then rinse it all out, this moves oils & dead skin etc off the scalp into the hair. Then you repeat (it'll be foamier this time) & this washes all the stuff out of your hair. \nAlso yes, use cooler water.\n\nDepends also on your water hardness, soft water will need far less shampoo & lots more rinsing compared to hard water. \n\nHow often you wash your hair can also depend on your hair type! Mines very straight & oily, so I can go 3 days without washing it, I can push it to 4 if I braid it but it does usually look oily by then. \nThat might be the hot water use, but it's Ireland, it's damp, cold & rainy & I'm not giving up hot water even for hair health!! XD", ">I did go in depth about why I need to do this with her.

If washing your hair less frequently is a recommended approach to address your dry scalp issue, and you've explained this to your roommate, it may be a matter of her needing to better understand the situation.  \nWhile you've been considerate of her concerns, you also need to prioritize your own comfort and health. You could consider discussing the issue with a residential advisor or housing staff who can mediate the situation and provide guidance on how to handle this roommate conflict. They may be able to help you find a resolution that respects both your needs and your roommate's feelings.  \nRemember that compromise and understanding are key in resolving such conflicts, but your health and well-being should also be a top priority.", "Like I said, unless it smells, then it's fine.\n\nHave my NTA", "NTA, your roommate is ridiculous. Many, many people, especially those with curly or coily hair cannot wash their hair more often than once or twice a week because it gets too dry and that type of hair needs the natural oils to be healthy. \n\nBecause it seems like she is refusing to believe you when you say that it is recommended, I'd go petty if it was me, just to prove my point... go online and find reputable sources where it specifically recommends less washing/no washing, print them and put them up all over your room. Or just keep asking her when she became a professional hair stylist and how she somehow knows soooooo much better than literally every ethnic hair stylist ever. She's an idiot and I'd drive it home until she gets the point. LOL but I have curly hair and this greatly annoys me and I'd go petty the whole way so maybe this isn't great advice.", "NTA - Just a tip - my fiance has the same thing. Clean hair, not oily. He uses Nizoral and it really helps.", "Nta - you can tell your roommate that you didn't ask for her opinion. Stop being too nice, she's being a jerk to you.\n\nGive a shot to massaging your scalp with coconut oil 2/3 hours before hair wash. I was skeptical but gosh no more itching!", "NTA. You mention that your hair is jet black-- black hair sometimes has much lower porosity than hair of other colors, largely depending on genetics. Porosity refers to how well your hair *absorbs* things-- which includes both products, and contaminants like sweat. Hair with lower porosity should be washed less frequently than hair with higher porosity, because it gets less dirty to begin with and also using products on it too frequently can cause the product to build up on the outside instead of getting absorbed. So even outside the issue with your scalp, it might be more suited to your hair type to wash less frequently anyways.\n\nYou can do a few different tests to determine the porosity of your hair, or just observe how it seems to react to products. But I suspect that if your hairdresser is telling you to wash less frequently, she probably has observed that your hair has low enough porosity for that to be an option for you. \n\nIf you do have low-porosity hair, you might benefit from hair care tutorials by Black women (who often have low-porosity hair) and/or hair care routines intended for people with curly hair (which is also often low-porosity). Even if your hair isn't textured in the same way, the porosity level might be the same and so you could still use some of the same techniques. I don't know much about Black hair care (I'm very fair and have fairly porous hair myself), but I do know that they have techniques for things like moisturizing the scalp with oils and protecting the hair from getting dirty while exercising, which might help you manage how frequently you need to wash your hair. \n\nYour roommate is probably speaking based on her own experience. I'd wager that she has more porous hair and her own hair thus needs washing more frequently than yours or it becomes noticeably greasy, so she can't imagine your hair NOT being greasy with less frequent washing. But I wouldn't call this a N A H because people with different hair types shouldn't use their own experiences as a basis for critiquing others, especially because there's often a racial component to the issue.", "NTA \n\nAs a fellow jet black/white flake member, this shit is mad annoying. I also wash once a week/ every other week. My hair is THICC. Like it\u2019s hot all the time so if I start to wash daily my shit is dry and annoying. Use coconut oil to lightly oil the scalp. Make sure you get regular cuts too! It helped a lot for mine.", "NTA Your hair is your choice, but do look into what shampoo you are using. Might be a good and expensive brand, but sometimes those things are scum and actually have trash ingredients! I would look at Mane and Tail shampoo, don't let the name fool you, it's for people!

I had something similar (and have very dark brown hair so like you, super noticeable) where I would get these almost scab-like flakes all over my scalp and of course it looks like dandruff. I was on a medicated shampoo from a dermatologist for about a year to first get it under control and after that I have able to self-contain it for the last \\~15 years with using T-gel shampoo (available at most major retailers, by Neutrogena). It contains coal tar and it helps treat dandruff, psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis (the latter two of which are itchy scalp conditions). If you haven't seen a dermatologist yet I'd highly recommend they take a look and in the meantime try out T-gel (or another coal tar based shampoo) to see if it makes a difference.

Also your roomate sounds borderline racist. MANY people of colour (and even those who arent, and just have curly hair) dont need to wash their hair as often because the sebum takes that much longer to travel down the hair, vs when its pin straight. I have wavy hair and that plus the dry scalp means i wash my hair every 2 weeks. And i promise you, within that first week my hair and scalp would be dry as straw (thankfully i oil it a little, not enough to make it greasy but enough so i dont feel like i have the end of a witches broom of my head).

Sounds a lot like psoriasis", "I'm in exactly the same boat with dark hair and a very dry scalp (psoriasis runs in the family) and here's some really key info that should help.\n\n1) drinking water is really important. Like 2l a day minimum. Also make sure it's water and not just liquids. You'd be amazed how much this helps.\n\n2) there's a fungal issue that most people have on scalps, which exacerbates dry scalp real bad. Id get an anti-fungal shampoo to use once a week like Nizoral, and whilst it won't clear it, it should lessen the amount.\n\n3) I know your hairdresser said wash less, but it's important you clarify between washing and rinsing. You'll definitely need to rinse more than once a week, otherwise oils and dirt will build up and cause damage, but not necessarily wash more than once. You also shouldn't go cold turkey, but rather build up to washing once every other day, every three days and so on over a few weeks.\n\n4) baby shampoo is great for when you need to wash (gym etc).

It was healthy and not prone to split ends, so I figured whatever.\n\nWhen I started looking into whether I'd just been caring for it the wrong way even when I was still bothering, some of the most common advice I saw was that it should not be washed as frequently as I had been.  I used to wash it every day to every other day.  I got a shower cap, started consistently using conditioner, stopped dry brushing it, and washed it 2x a week.  These days I usually wash it 1x a week.  It's never looked better, and now it actually takes a *lot* longer than it used to to start looking/feeling a little greasy.\n\nI've found I do prefer that weekly shampoo.
