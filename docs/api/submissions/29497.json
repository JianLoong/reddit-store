I have an extremely dry scalp that always gets those maddening tiny white flakes that people often mistake for dandruff (dandruff chunks are bigger and yellow and come from oily hair). I recently asked a hairstylist for advice and she suggested less hot showers on top of washing my hair less. I looked it up and found that many people wash their hair once or twice a week. Because of how itchy my hair is, I\u2019ve decided once a week. \n\nNow here\u2019s the issue of my roommate: she started noticing that every time I come out of my regular showers that my hair is dry. She asked if I\u2019m not washing my hair and l said yes. She gave me a disgusting look and said \u201cthat\u2019s gross.\u201d I explained the dry scalp thing but she did not seem convinced that washing your hair once a week was hygienic. I continued on anyway. Every time I would consistently come out of the shower with dry hair she would go on about how disgusting it is that I don\u2019t wash my hair. Reminder: I do wash my hair, just not often. \n\nTo me it\u2019s very important I start getting these flakes under control because my hair is naturally jet black so it\u2019s very obvious when they\u2019re there. My roommate however insists it\u2019s more important I wash my hair minimum every other day. She keeps insisting I\u2019m being absolutely gross and making her uncomfortable almost every day now.

Tell her to ask her stylist if there's anything wrong with washing your hair once a week. I also only wash my hair once a week,  I have very fine hair, and more frequent washing really dries it out.

I did this and I gave myself basically adult cradle cap even though I was brushing my hair out every day.

I wash mine once a week and it was the best decision I ever made.", "In this situation, it's important to consider both your need for hair care and your roommate's perspective on hygiene. You're not necessarily the \"asshole\" for trying a hair care routine that has been recommended by a professional to address your dry scalp issue.  \nHowever, it's also important to communicate with your roommate and find a balance. While washing your hair once a week may be necessary for your specific condition, there are ways to manage the situation without making your roommate uncomfortable. You could use a shower cap or shower at times when your roommate is not present to address her concerns.  \nThe key here is open communication and mutual respect. Discussing the issue with your roommate, explaining the reasons behind your hair care routine, and finding ways to accommodate both your needs and her comfort can help resolve the situation amicably. Remember, it's about striking a balance that respects both your needs and your roommate's feelings.", "NTA- not meant to wash you're hair too often as it takes away the natural oils. Ignore or tell your roommate to F off.\nI only wash my hair once or twice a week because if I do it too often it gets greasy on top and super dry at the ends and most of the girls I know are the same. She's actually a minority in my opinion.", "NTA. That's none of her business.\n\n>I explained the dry scalp thing\n\nYou don't have to tell her. She's your roommate, not your mom or your girlfriend. Tell her to leave you alone. If she wants to wash her hair every time she's taking a shower, that's on her. If you want to wash your hair once a week, that's on you.

I don\u2019t think your roommate realises that it\u2019s different for everyone, and for a lot of people washing it once or twice a week is the best for them, and for others, daily works for them. She\u2019s being ignorant and stupid. Ignore it.", "NTA. I have curly hair. It HATES being washed more than once a week. Your hair your business", "Well..depends, doesn't it? If I get sweaty at the gym, I'm washing that hair!", "Unless it ends up stinking.\n\nBut that also goes with having showers and general hygiene. \n\nI don't care if someone only wants to have a sink shower once a month, but the moment you smell bad and it's having an effect on me, then get away or have a real shower", "I\u2019ve done that a couple times. I dry that while I\u2019m in the bathroom so that could be throwing her off too.", "Thank you, I was already only washing it every other day and would sometimes end up skipping so I think I\u2019m okay but I\u2019ll definitely be careful.", "I did go in depth about why I need to do this with her. I explained how washing it regularly is stripping away the oils I need (another commenter suggested I shouldn\u2019t have to explain this) and that washing it less is what\u2019s working. She\u2019s still not convinced and insists it\u2019s gross. As for washing it when she\u2019s not there that\u2019s not really an option because when she\u2019s not in class she\u2019s almost always in the room and a lot of our classes line up time wise. Even if I used a shower cap she\u2019d still know I\u2019m not washing my hair. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of seeing my hair, I think it\u2019s the idea that she knows I\u2019m not washing it is the issue.", "Sure. But OP didn't mention gym or anything. So that why I said that once a week is fine.", "Like I said I still shower even if I\u2019m not washing my hair. It doesn\u2019t stink as my hair always smells the same way if no scented shampoo (no clue why, might be something in my genes) and it\u2019s not a bad smell.", "NTA.\n\nSo a hairdresser told me once that sometimes those flakes are also from using too much shampoo & not rinsing all of it out. Then they see those flakes & buy anti-dandruff shampoo which is harsher & it makes it worse!\n\n It was supposed to be roughly a 1euro coin amount on the top of the head & massage in. Then rinse it all out, this moves oils & dead skin etc off the scalp into the hair. Then you repeat (it'll be foamier this time) & this washes all the stuff out of your hair. \nAlso yes, use cooler water.\n\nDepends also on your water hardness, soft water will need far less shampoo & lots more rinsing compared to hard water. \n\nHow often you wash your hair can also depend on your hair type! Mines very straight & oily, so I can go 3 days without washing it, I can push it to 4 if I braid it but it does usually look oily by then. \nThat might be the hot water use, but it's Ireland, it's damp, cold & rainy & I'm not giving up hot water even for hair health!! XD", ">I did go in depth about why I need to do this with her.

If washing your hair less frequently is a recommended approach to address your dry scalp issue, and you've explained this to your roommate, it may be a matter of her needing to better understand the situation.  \nWhile you've been considerate of her concerns, you also need to prioritize your own comfort and health. You could consider discussing the issue with a residential advisor or housing staff who can mediate the situation and provide guidance on how to handle this roommate conflict. They may be able to help you find a resolution that respects both your needs and your roommate's feelings.  \nRemember that compromise and understanding are key in resolving such conflicts, but your health and well-being should also be a top priority.", "Like I said, unless it smells, then it's fine.\n\nHave my NTA"]}
