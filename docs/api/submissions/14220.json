My favourite food in the entire world is steak. I love it. I booked in a reservation at this new Wagyu KBBQ place for my dinner. The place is new and the beef is top notch quality, so it\u2019s hard to get a reservation unless you book early.\n\nOne of my best friends (22F) is Hindu and doesn\u2019t eat beef or pork. This KBBQ place literally only serves beef and pork - the only things on the menu that she would be able to eat are the sides like rice, corn, kimchi, etc.\n\nI didn\u2019t invite her to the dinner and instead we went out for Indian food the day before my birthday. When she found out she wasn\u2019t invited the day after my birthday she got upset. I sent her a long paragraph to say that I was sorry and that the only reason she wasn\u2019t invited was because she wouldn\u2019t be able to eat anything, hence why I went out with her privately the day before.\n\nShe told me that I should\u2019ve just picked another restaurant. I think it\u2019s a bit entitled of her to want me to change my plans for her? I\u2019ve wanted to go to this new KBBQ place for months!\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680881881, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ep8yg/aita_for_not_inviting_my_hindu_friend_to_my/", "score": 1010, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your birthday, your wish.\n\nYou did spend the previous day with them.\n\nI think the only thing you could have done here is that you could have informed her the reason beforehand instead of her finding out.\n\nThough I don't think she would still be fine with it. She's the AH here.", "NTA\n\nMaybe it would have been better to tell her about your birthday plans when you were making the reservation, or invited her and let her choose if she wants to go or not.\n\nHowever, her saying you should have just picked another restaurant IS a bit entitled and I think makes her the AH here. \n\nI think maybe you didn't tell her earlier because you knew she would react badly and try to make you change your plans for her.", "NTA - You didn't have any bad intentions, but you should probably have given her the choice. The fact that she wanted you to have changed the venue for her when she found out tells me she would have probably caused problems if you told her before the party. You still went out of your way to celebrate with her too.", "ESH. You should have invited her and let her decide for herself if she wants to attend.\n>\nShe\u2019s wrong in saying that you should have selected a different restaurant. She can\u2019t expect to be catered to, especially on your birthday.", "ESH. Let her decide if she wants to go. I\u2019m vegan and have opted to go to dinner plans to places I couldn\u2019t eat so that I could hang out with my friends, I just eat beforehand. \n\nYou suck for not considering the possibility that she may want to come and just would have eaten beforehand. \n\nShe sucks for saying you should have changed locations and she would have sucked had you asked and she insisted you change the reservation to a restaurant she can eat at.", "NTA- You wanted to go to a specific place that you were looking forward to eating at. You shouldn\u2019t change your birthday plans for someone else. You also made the time to celebrate with her. \n\nIt would have been nice if you told her the plan so she could make the choice to come and eat sides, but even that doesn\u2019t make you an AH.", "Going against the grain and saying ESH\n\nYour reasons are sound and make perfect sense except that your purposefully chose to exclude someone you consider a friend instead of extending an invitation and letting her decide if she'd go or decline. You also apparently didn't make it clear that the dinner you had together was in place of her invitation to dinner with everyone else. You could have easily said \"hey ABC! I chose the waygu place for my birthday dinner and since I know you don't eat beef, would you like to get dinner with me on X day instead?\"\n\nShe's an asshole for suggesting you find a different restaurant for your birthday. That dinner choice is yours, not someone else's. I also think she's an ass for not being able to figure out that the separate dinner was your way of celebrating with her. \n\nI think you and your friends need better communication", "You didn't need to pick a different restaurant, but you should have asked her ahead of time if she wanted to join you.\n\nNAH/ESH something like that.", "Esh. You\u2019re TA for not being upfront. You thought she wouldn\u2019t find out about the party? She\u2019s TA for demanding you pick a different restaurant.", "There is a way to tackle this which would have preserved you and villainized her.\n\nShe took it personally that she wasnt invited and the optics of that are that you deliberately excluded her.  You made the decision for her.\n\nYou should have asked privately her anyway to come but make note of the menu of the restaurant.  This way it is her decision whether or not to attend.  If she refused, you removed the ammo that she was excluded.\n\nYou should be able to eat what you want to on your bday.   And she declined the restaurant invitation graciously, perhaps you 2 could have gone out together and eaten somewhere else that suited her.  You both screwed up here so ESH", "ESH\n\nYou should have still invited her and let her decide if she wanted to go or not. Its not up to her where you have your birthday dinner, but it's an asshole move to not invite someone. You were kind enough to take her out beforehand, but you should have communicated about this when making the reservation. She may have just been fine with sides", "ESH. You should've let her decide rather than treat her like a kid and decide for her. She has no right to demand that you change the restaurant.", "I was gonna say N A H at first bc you could\u2019ve still invited her just as a courtesy. BUT you were sweet to think of her and went somewhere she could eat the day before and she was entitled to say \u201cyou should\u2019ve picked somewhere else\u201d. It\u2019s your birthday and you were looking forward to this place. NTA because since she made the comment of going somewhere else, I\u2019m sure she would\u2019ve made you feel bad for your choice had you given her the courtesy invite.", "You can choose any restaurant you want for your birthday, but  you should her told her and given her the chance to opt out or come and eat side dishes. NTA", "YTA. You should have invited her and then let her decide whether or not to come.\n\nI\u2019m having a hard time believing that there would literally be nothing for her to eat.  They can prepare the veggies and leave out the meat. Still up to the friend to decide, not OP to decide for her.", "NTA leaning toward a light E S H\n\nThe only thing I think you could have done better though is explain to your friend ahead of time about your birthday dinner and how your lunch with her the day before was so you could celebrate with her and respect her cultural beliefs.  Something like \"Hey BFF.  For my birthday I am planning to go to a KBBQ and bring people.  I looked at the menu ahead of time and there aren't any real alternatives to accommodate your personal beliefs though.  I still want to celebrate my birthday with you because I love you, so I was thinking we could get lunch at a place you enjoy the day before just us.  Does that sound good?\"  This would have solved everything by being open about your plans.", "YTA. You handled it so badly. You could've asked her if she wanted to go while telling her the menu too. Of she chose to go it would've been on her. You are allowed to choose where you wanna celebrate your bday but if she's one of your best friend, it's pretty weird not to invite her.", "YTA. Although it was nice of you to meet up beforehand, the fact that your friend didn't know she wasn't invited till the last minute is shitty. You could've told her that you wanted steak/pork for your b'day and given her the choice of joining in or dropping out. You don't get to decide for her, or anyone else. Birthdays or any celebration for that matter is not about the food, it's about the company. If you want her company you invite her.", "YTA. It's not just about the food. Also, YTA for making assumptions like that. But she's also TA for saying you should have chose a different restaurant, so, I guess this is really an ESH situation.", "ESH.\n\nYour friend is upset that she was excluded from a social setting moreso than the fact that she wasn\u2019t able to eat anything. But she shouldn\u2019t expect you to change restaurants for her. It\u2019s your birthday.", "ESH you could invite her and she say no but let her decide and she has no saying on the place you pick for your Bday.\n\nYou should invite for courtesy and if she decide to go and just eat side dishes would've been up to her. I have a lot of food allergies so cannot really eat out and feels bad went I don't get invited due to it. I have gone places and just have a drink still we have a great time (I eat before hand, not like I starve). \n\nAnd she is also in the wrong because is your Bday you decide what you want, she is not the center of the world to have a friend change her celebration place just so she can assist.", "You're not the asshole for not inviting her, but you really should have explained beforehand. This way she's discovered, after the fact, that she was the only person not invited? That's gonna make you feel shitty regardless of any justification.\n\nDid she know that the meal out the day before was because she wasn't invited to your birthday, or did you keep your reasoning to yourself?", "ESH", "ESH. You should have invited her and told her what type of restaurant it was and let her decide to not come. She\u2019s def the AH for expecting you to change your bday plans for her.", "ESH. You could have let her know where you wanted to go and then she would have had a choice as to whether she attended and had a cocktail and a side salad or skipped it. \n\nBut it was also really out of line for her to say you should have chosen a different restaurant. IMO the onus is on the person with particular dietary preferences/needs to figure out social situations. My dear friend is vegan and she always calls ahead to restaurants to see what she can eat there\u2014a lot of places will be super accommodating if you give them a heads up!\u2014or else she eats beforehand and just comes to socialize. \n\nNext time, if you want her there, just give her ample notice and let her decide how to handle the situation. If you want to go out of your way you could call the restaurant on her behalf.", "ESH. A birthday celebration isn't only about the food, but much more so about the social setting and the company. So decicing for her and not inviting her isn't great. You could have easily told her that you really wanted to celebrate that that place and that of course she was invited, but you knew that it wasn't ideal for her diet so if she wanted to you could go out to eat together the day before. That way she had the option of joining for the social aspect, and would be able to make the decision on her own. If my best friend invited lots of people to a party on her birthday, but decided not to invite me or even tell me, even if her reason made sense (I don't love big parties), it would 100% have made me feel left out.\n\nHer reaction of saying you could have just picked another restaurant is the reason for ESH instead of YTA. It might just be a gut reaction out of anger or disappointment, but either way, it is entitled.", "ESH.\n\nIt was going to be Y T A because you could have told her your plans, which she could have thanked you for and politely declined.\n\nHowever, \n\n>\nShe told me that I should\u2019ve just picked another restaurant.\n\nThis totally swayed it for me! She is more of an AH, but you slightly suck too. No offense intended there. I hope you enjoyed your steak and had a lovely birthday.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here and say YTA. Or, at the very least, I understand why she\u2019d be hurt.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to eat to celebrate. You don\u2019t have to drink if you go to a party at a bar. The venue is just the venue. I don\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t cross your mind to just text her, \u201cHey, I know you can\u2019t eat the food, but I\u2019d love to have you there if you are comfortable going.\u201d", "Soft ESH.\nI don't think it was handled well by anyone. You should have been more up front with her and explained your plans and the menu as you explained here, that would have gone down better, I'm sure.\nOn the flip side, she shouldn't be trying to dictate where you should be going for your birthday, what you did was a nice gesture", "NTA but you definitely could have handled it better. You should have told her your plans for your birthday, either waited for her to decline or offered the alternative that you did give her, by going somewhere she would enjoy the day before. I actually think that's very thoughtful of you. But doing it the way you did probably felt like a snub and was hurtful to her.", "ESH, you for just not inviting without talking to her and her for saying you should have just chosen a different restaurant. The better option would have been to to say 'Friend, I'm planning to go to this restaurant I don't think you'll be able to eat at at for my birthday, but I still want to spend an evening with you, can we go to different place the night before to celebrate?' then she'd have the opportunity to look at the menu say yeah can't eat there how's this? And be involved in the decision rather than you just excluding her and making separate kind of secret plans. This isn't a huge infraction but I can see why she feels bad.", "ESH\n\nIt is entitled of her to demand you change the restaurant, it's your birthday and your choice.\n\nHowever I think you went about it in the worst way, instead of letting your friend decide if she wants to come or not you didn't invite her, which obviously hurt her feelings. A simple \"Hey we are going to X restaurant, since you can't eat much there you can totally skip it and hang the day before\", she could have skip the dinner or went knowing what the circumstances were. Instead she felt excluded.", "ESH  Why didn't you simply TELL her that you were going to the steak restaurant for your birthday and that while you want to invite her, you understand there are aren't many choices for her there and if she'd rather decline the invitation you're totally ok with that and your feelings won't be hurt--then suggest going to the Indian restaurant just the two of you on a different day.  \n\n\nShe, for her part, had no business insisting that you choose another place to celebrate your birthday--that was completely inappropriate on her part--however because of the way you handled things she found out she was excluded and was hurt by that exclusion.  \n\nApologize for how you handled it-- but be clear that it was a special dinner for your birthday and you wanted to go to the steak house and mistakenly thought the way you handled it would be easier on her feelings--own that it wasn't and both agree to do better next time.", "NTA\n\nYour birthday, your rules. If she couldn't eat anything then why would she want to pay to attend a party in that she can't participate in?", "ESH. You shouldn't make unilateral decisions on what you think is best for people, she might have been just fine eating a few sides so she can celebrate with you and be included. You should have extended an invite with a heads up to check the menu.\n\nHer suggesting that you change the location of your own birthday dinner is ridiculous. I'm all for inclusion, and if this was a friends gathering I would vote differently, but it's your birthday dinner. Eat where you want.", "ESH. \nYou should have extended the invite and let your friend decide if she was happy just eating slides. \n\nYour friend is also an A H for expecting you to change your plans to suit her needs.", "NTA.  You don\u2019t have to arrange your birthday dinner around other people\u2019s eating and she shouldn\u2019t expect you to.  But a heads up to her would have been nice- then she could\u2019ve made the choice if she wanted to just eat sides to still be with the group.", "ESH. \n\nShould've spoken with her beforehand, or just invited her while making it clear there probably wouldn't be much she could eat on the menu and allowing her to still join or decline. (Hence Y T A) \n\nBut she has no right to tell you to change what you want for dinner on your birthday just so she can be included. (Hence she is also an AH)", "NTA, bro you guys went and got food the day before", "ESH i have vegetarian friends, I have sober friends, When I have a whole group celebration/outing I invite everyone and am simply very clear what the night will entail so people can self select out. It\u2019s fucking wild she thinks you should have picked another place. So while you were a bit rude I guess she proved you did the right thing", "ESH. You for just not inviting her when it should have been her choice to attend & her for even suggesting you should have picked another spot to celebrate your birthday.", "YTA", "ESH\n\nYou took it upon yourself to decide for her whether or not she would want to go and have the limited food options. Why couldn\u2019t she have been given the option to go if she wanted to be there with everyone else, even if she wasn\u2019t able to eat the featured items?\n\nAnd why put her and other friends in the position where they would find out after the fact that you had kept this dinner secret from her?  That must have been awkward when she found out, and awkward for the person she found out from. \n\nShe\u2019s being an asshole also for suggesting that on your birthday, you should have had to choose a different place to go in order to accommodate her. She should have been allowed the choice to go or not, but she shouldn\u2019t be expecting that you change your plans around just to make it so she can have a better time.\n\n(ESH but you are the bigger asshole of the two.)", "NTA noone is entitled to be invited to YOUR birthday dinner. You don't need any explanation for it", "Esh\n\nYou wanted to eat where *you*wanted to eat on your birthday. You should have still invited her though and let her either decline the invite, or find something she wanted of the menu. \n\nShe had no right to tell you to pick a place *she* wanted to go on your birthday.", "NTA\n\n\nThough next time give her the option to choose. I can see being unhappy about being left out of the friend group.", "ESH \n\nYou should have invited her if she was a friend, regardless of whether you thought she wanted to eat there or not (she could always order a drink and just spend time with her friends). \n\nShe is the AH for expecting you to change your bday venue because of her dietary needs.", "I'd say you are the AH, but for a different reason. It would've been nice if you'd discussed this a couple of weeks before your birthday with your hindu friend, and explained to her that the meal you were having with her one on one was because the other restaurant would not have anything for her. But of course, she might still miss the company and sense of camaraderie that she would've experienced with the group.", "I also went to KBBQ AYCE for my birthday! I hope your bulgogi and/or galbi was as delicious as mine was! Having said that, light ESH just because you kinda chose for her (which is logical btw and I get why you did it) but it hurts to feel excluded. It would have been better to have told her beforehand where you were going", "ESH. YTA because you took the decision away from her. Part of the birthday celebration is celebrating you, not the food you eat. So I can see how she would feel slighted at not being invited because she could interpret it as not being as close with you as she thought. For example, a friend didn\u2019t invite me to his bachelor party because he thought it was out of my price range. But he took the agency away from to make that decision. Next time, invite her and let her make the decision.\n\nShe\u2019s TA because she expected you to change you birthday plans for her. Her entitled behavior was not cool at all.", "YTA. This is one of those things where you ask them beforehand as a gesture and let them turn it down. You assuming she didn\u2019t wanna go is rude. She is an adult, she can look at a menu beforehand and decide for herself. \n\n\u201cHey friend! I\u2019m planning to go to KBBQ for my birthday, here\u2019s info on the time and place, let me know if you\u2019re interested.\u201d", "ESH You should have invited her and let her decide for herself, as opposed to deciding for her. Maybe she would have been okay with eating aides because it was celebrating with you. She is also an AH for saying you should have picked a different restaurant, though maybe she said that because she was angry that you'd taken the choice away from her.", "ESH! I think you\u2019re TA because you should have invited her but let her know \u201cI know you don\u2019t eat meat and this spot is mainly dishes with meat so there might not be many options for you. I would love to have you there but totally understand if you won\u2019t be able to come because of the food options\u201d She\u2019s TA for telling you that you could have picked a different restaurant but maybe her reaction would have been different if you would have done what I suggested at the top. Yes, you went out with her the day before but if she\u2019s a really good friend of yours I can see how it would hurt her if she wasn\u2019t invited to your actual birthday dinner she most likely felt excluded. To me it\u2019s always the thought that counts. Do your part by doing the invite and let the other decide if they join or not. Or are you the type of person who would get offended if she would have declined the invitation?", "I'm torn but YTA.\n\nYou went out privately with her but you didn't tell her about your main bday dinner. That's painful and you could and imo should have given her a choice.\n\nI have celiac and lactose intolerance and its near impossible for me to go out to eat yet I'd still rather be able to spend time with my dear friends and only eat rice than not even be included with everyone else. I feel for your friend here.", "ESH while the comment about choosing a different restaurant was unwarranted, you should have let your friend decide whether they were fine ordering sides or wanted to decline the invitation. It obviously stings not being invited to people's birthday dinners, especially since you weren't upfront about it.", "I would\u2019ve said y t a if she hadn\u2019t insisted that you should\u2019ve picked another restaurant. I would have said invite her anyway out of courtesy, but if you had, based on her reaction, she probably would\u2019ve complained that she couldn\u2019t eat anything. NTA, she can\u2019t expect everyone around her to (literally) cater to her specialized diet.", "NTA it\u2019s my birthday, and I eat what to. You would eat what you want if it happened to you. Song to their music off it\u2019s my party and I\u2019ll cry if I want to.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m a vegetarian (lifelong) and I\u2019d hate to be invited to a steakhouse for dinner and feel obligated cos it\u2019s my friend\u2019s birthday. Your comprise would have been so appreciated! Not needing to research a menu to see if I can eat any of the sides and to have such a considerate friend would be AMAZING! \n\nI can see how her feeling got hurt but it\u2019s your birthday, you still wanted to do something with her and she needs to understand it\u2019s not all about her", "ESH\n\nYou- You could've asked her if she had wanted to come and let her decide for herself if she wanted to eat the side dishes or chose to not come.\n\nHer- It's completely your choice where you want to go for your birthday. You shouldn't have to change where you want to go for your birthday because of someone else.\n\nYou certainly don't need her permission to go anywhere for your birthday and she was wrong to suggest you should have considered going elsewhere as it's your decision but it would've been better to have asked her if she wanted to go rather than making the assumption that she wouldn't.", "ESH. She's not entitled to tell you to pick a different restaurant,  but it's the thought of an invitation that counts. You should have invited her and then offered to do something on a different day if she didn't feel comfortable going to the restaurant.", "Tbh, I think she just said the \u201cyou should\u2019ve picked another restaurant\u201d out of anger, not genuine entitlement. I think you are slightly the AH for not inviting her and giving her a choice, but again yeah even if it was said out of anger, shouldn\u2019t have said that you should\u2019ve changed the restaurant on your birthday.", "Very slight YTA. Take this as an opportunity to learn from it. I agree with a lot of the others that said you should have spoken to your friend about the whole thing up front. Your friend is rightly hurt to feel excluded from a big event because they were. She also is a slight AH for her reaction of saying you should have picked something different. \n\nNext time, all of this could have been solved with a conversation up front. If you are afraid of how someone might react to a simple and honest conversation, then they may not be the right fit for you as a friend (or partner, significant other, spouse, etc. apply too).\n\nI think this world could use a whole lot more honest conversations early to save misunderstandings and strife later. But I am as guilty as the next person sometimes and could still work to get better.", "I\u2019m going with YTA. If she\u2019s your best friend, the least you could have done is explain you wanted to try out this new KBBQ spot and there\u2019s nothing that would really suit her diet. You can still extend an invite but explain that you know there\u2019s not much she could eat there. If she really is your best friend, you should have explained the situation to her instead of lying about your party, I bet she feels really shitty about that. She shouldn\u2019t have said to change your plans, but you shouldn\u2019t have lied to her. Communication goes a long way.", "NTA", "Why? She should be able to enjoy her day however she wants.", "YTA for not being upfront and honest with her; you absolutely should get to pick the restaurant you celebrate your birthday at. But not being honest with her and letting her decide makes the AH in this situation.", "Esh, I do think you should've extended the offer and it would've been on her to decline or come and eat the side dishes, but she was an ah for saying you should've picked another place. In my opinion you are a very soft Ah compared to her, you even had dinner with her the day before, but I think you should've brought it up to her then. \n\n\"Remember that new kbbq place I've been dying to try for months? well, I was thinking of having dinner there tomorrow for my birthday, they mostly serve meat but there's also some side dishes you can eat like rice, corn and kimchi. You are a very important friend to me and I would love it if you could come, and I know the menu is not ideal but I can take you out to eat some other time to make it up to you!\" something like this, I suppose.\n\nIs she comfortable with people eating pork/beef around her? 'Cause if this was just a one time thing, you guys can just grab dinner and clear the air. Tell her how much you cherish her as a friend, but that you also want to be able to eat meat and try different things. She could've been upset not because there was meat involved, but because she wasn't invited to your birthday dinner. If she is uncomfortable, then I don't really know how to help you here...", "NTA. You get to eat where you want on your birthday, that\u2019s the rule. Maybe try another talk with her, see if she really won\u2019t understand that. \n\nGenerally said, though, it\u2019s always better to be upfront and just tell people, rather than wait for them to find out.", "ESH\nshe is intitled indeed but why can't you literally just ask people their opinion beforehand if they're as important to you as it looks like.\nshe is a friend that you clearly love and have space to talk, why not just ask, you could have texted her something like: hey, i want to do something for MY birthday in a place that is exactly *proceeds to explain like you did* is that okay to you to come and eat only the sides? We can have something we both really enjoy together later or after. What do you think?\"", "ESH\n\nI don't eat beef either. But I would still expect a friend to invite me and give me a choice whether to decline or not. If it were me, I would have gone, ate fries and then got something on the way home. No biggie that I couldn't eat but at least I could have socialised.\n\nShe sucks a bit for expecting you to have changed your restaurant option. But maybe she was hurt when she said it? Tbh though, I wouldn't pick a restaurant like that when inviting people out. I have a vegan friend and always pick vegan-friendly places when she's part of the group and then pick meatier places for my other friend groups. So I don't really get why you couldn't have picked somewhere more accommodating and went to the KBBQ place another time. But I don't think that makes you an AH.

My favourite food in the entire world is steak. I love it. I booked in a reservation at this new Wagyu KBBQ place for my dinner. The place is new and the beef is top notch quality, so it\u2019s hard to get a reservation unless you book early.\n\nOne of my best friends (22F) is Hindu and doesn\u2019t eat beef or pork. This KBBQ place literally only serves beef and pork - the only things on the menu that she would be able to eat are the sides like rice, corn, kimchi, etc.\n\nI didn\u2019t invite her to the dinner and instead we went out for Indian food the day before my birthday. When she found out she wasn\u2019t invited the day after my birthday she got upset. I sent her a long paragraph to say that I was sorry and that the only reason she wasn\u2019t invited was because she wouldn\u2019t be able to eat anything, hence why I went out with her privately the day before.\n\nShe told me that I should\u2019ve just picked another restaurant. I think it\u2019s a bit entitled of her to want me to change my plans for her? I\u2019ve wanted to go to this new KBBQ place for months!\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But it\u2019s NTA because of her entitlement.  I have been in many positions where the restaurant was already decided (for whatever reason, the decision was rightfully out of my hand) and I have always been able to find something to eat; it may not be as satisfying as my fellow diners, but it\u2019s one meal and it will not kill me to leave my tastebuds dissatisfied for one night, especially if it were a celebration.

Could be the friend is the type that is offended seeing beef on a plate, kind of like vegans don't want to see meat on the table. \n\nAnd yeah, good friends try not to offend each other when they know they have differing views.", "How does that conversation go though?\n\n\"I know that cows are sacred to you and therefore eating beef is forbidden by your religion, but would you like to come to this restaurant where literally everyone is going to be eating part cooked cow?\"\n\nSeems a pretty shitty and insulting thing to do.", "She didn't actually make any choices for anyone though? She just didn't invite a specific person to this dinner.", "Bot account. Please downvote and report!", ">She could have invited her friend but let her know about the menu.\n\nYes to this.\n\n>She could have gone to the steak place the day before and gone somewhere else for her birthday.\n\nNo to this. She doesn't have to change plans for one person's dietary restrictions on her *birthday.*", "She wanted the steak on her birthday, so why should she forgoe that because of her friend? Taking her friend on a different day was the right thing to do. But yes, she could have told her about it first.", "OP should have been up front, the friend should have been less entitled and not demanded OP pick a different restaurant, everyone can learn from this and move on.", "And besides, if you're hosting a party at a BBQ joint, if you ask them if they can prepare something special for a vegetarian, my experience (as a veg myself) is that they'll happily come up with SOMETHING. \n\nOP, YTA. It's not your business to make decisions for others based upon your perception of their morals. You easily could have invited her, let HER decide if she could/could not attend. If my best friend didn't invite me on the grounds that he thought I wouldn't want to go (let ME decide that, please?), I would be miffed, and I'm speaking from personal experience.", "Why can't the OP get to do what they want for their birthday? Instead of changing their whole birthday plans, they should've just extended the offer to go to the BBQ place with a warning that they might not be able to eat much there.", "But it\u2019s OPs birthday? So confused by this response. OP gets to eat whatever they want on their bday", "Ya wtf am I reading from all these people?! Obviously OP is the AH! Not bc they didn\u2019t pick a diff restaurant, though that definitely does give an indication of OPs priorities. But bc they didn\u2019t even talk to their friend about it??\n\nOP, did you not consider flipping the nights so you can still have your steak and go somewhere with the group that accommodates everyone you care about? Or, at the very least, why didn\u2019t you talk to her about it?! The BARE MINIMUM would have been to just tell her you\u2019ve been dying to try this restaurant and really want to go for your bday but you know it won\u2019t be accommodating of her dietary restrictions, and offer her some options! Extend the invite and let her decide if she would prefer to eat before hand and participate in the celebrations knowing that her options there are limited, or if she\u2019d rather opt out and do something with you separately. This would have at least showed that you care about her and wanted her there to celebrate with you and are considerate of her cultural differences. Instead you made an assumption about what she would want and excluded her based on her cultural differences. Something that people of colour have to deal with constantly, so this wouldn\u2019t have been an isolated incident for her. Think about it, you literally just assumed that your Hindu friend would rather just get Indian food with you anyways than be included in the group and you\u2019re shocked they\u2019re upset about it? Come on people.\n\nSo ya, YTA. Not bc of your choice of restaurant but bc of the abysmal handling of the situation. And bc of that I give her a pass for asking why you didn\u2019t pick somewhere else. She\u2019s obviously hurt that she\u2019s dealing with this exclusion yet again from her friend. I doubt that if you had just talked to her about it before hand and figured out a solution together that this would have been an issue. If you want to keep your friend, apologize for your ignorant mistake, learn from it and grow.", "Yeah I can't eat fish or shellfish, but I'll hang at the sushi joint with my sister or friends. I'll just eat before or after. Sometimes I suffer the consequences of likely cross contamination and have the sesame balls because delicious. But it's about hanging out.", "It's the fact the friend found out about it the day after her birthday dinner. They're apparently best friends but she didn't at any point tell her she had plans to celebrate her actual birthday with other people? No \"so how are you going to spend your birthday tomorrow?\" During their private dinner? Was it kept a secret this whole time considering OP booked far in advance? If that happened to me my first thought would have been that I was lied to and felt I wasn't invited for other reasons and the beef/pork was just an excuse.\n\nI get OP doesn't owe her anything but I mean surely she thought her friend would have caught wind one way or another so she could have given her a heads up to prevent the shock/misunderstanding.", "I give the friend a pass for her comment.  It was after she found out she wasn't invited in the first place.  It's coming from a place of hurt; probably not from a sense of entitlement.  But I do agree that it's not cool to expect birthday girl to change her restaurant.", "But when the friend was informed they said \u201cyou should have chosen a different restaurant that I could attend\u201d she wasn\u2019t told for a reason because she\u2019s mildly entitled. I regularly leave my vegan husband and friends out of things they don\u2019t complain.", "Exactly. Especially because she likely could have eaten plenty. Any good korean bbq place (and it sounds like this one was) would have loads of delicious banchan options that could actually be properly filling on their own. OP isn't technically TA, but definitely could have handled it better, and the friend may have wanted to come. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE korean bbq, but even if I was vegetarian I would still go and enjoy the sides and be there for my friend's birthday.", "It sounds like she woulda.", "This!", "Same I get sad when i have to bow out because of dietary restrictions but if i really wanted to spend the day with a friend I'd just eat beforehand and have fries and a drink.", "Indeed. I felt that way too until OP mentioned she said, \"Why couldn't you just go somewhere else?\"\n\nWhich tells me OP was trying to avoid drama.", "And she did. The day before at a personally catered dinner that\u2019s perfect for her dietary restrictions. OP went above and beyond", "If it is a buffet style or pay at entree, are all those sides worth the potential $30-60 price tag?\n\nI would have invited her and just let her choose to attend or not but based on her response to tell OP to \"find a new place\" that tells me it would have caused more drama before the event.", "If that was the reasoning yes but after the fact she said they could have gone somewhere else.  I think OP should have invited her but stayed firm on the location because it was their birthday, so their choice.", "If she'd said that in other context I'd agree. But I think it was specifically in response to OP saying \"I didn't invite you because of the restaurant.\" In that context I think it's more reasonable to be like \"So you should have picked a different restaurant.\"", "I get the getting OP expected this reaction to some degree. Plus, the fact that she did a separate celebration with her friend puts her slightly in NTA for me.", "My point being that based on how the friend reacted, it doesn\u2019t matter that she didn\u2019t invite her. Her friend didn\u2019t say, you should\u2019ve invited me I would\u2019ve loved to come anyways. Her friend said, you should\u2019ve chosen a different restaurant. That\u2019s entitlement", "Even so she wanted to be a part of the birthday party I guess and would have been happy nibbling on veg and dairy. She probably does that a lot. And asking your friend to pick another place doesn't speak of entitlement but of inclusivity. But, ultimately it's OP' s choice. It's HER party.", "Yeah, it seems like if OP had invited her, the friend would have just laid on the guilt trip about choosing a different place before the event instead of after it. \n\nOP is allowed to eat what she wants just like her Hindu friend is allowed to not eat what she wants. For most friend outings, it\u2019s nice to pick a place where everyone can get something they enjoy, but you\u2019re allowed to be a little selfish on your birthday and go somewhere that serves your favorite meal, even if not everyone can or would want to go there.", "I completely agree. As a person who hasn't had an animal product in over 15 years, I would've still liked to be invited. I still like celebrating with people even if they choose a place I can't order an entree at. I don't mind eating before a party. \n\nThe friend saying to pick somewhere else was wrong, but OP should've told her she wanted KBBQ for their birthday celebration and let her decide if she was comfortable with that or not. I would be really hurt to be excluded and kept in the dark on the situation.", "MTE. I don\u2019t like sushi. My friends in college knew this. They would still invite me when they went out for sushi because it was a nice way of including me. I\u2019d always politely turn them down but thank them for inviting me.\n\nI think it *is* entitled of the friend to say OP could\u2019ve chosen another restaurant when it\u2019s OP\u2019s birthday and she should get to eat what she wants, but it would\u2019ve been polite to invite the friend and explain that you understand that it might not be to her liking.", "Also if you call a restaurant with notice they can normally do a veggie dish for someone even ifnits not normally on the menu, or advise what that person can have.", "That probably would have been the best way to go about it. But I feel like it wouldnt have changed anything, based on the friend's reaction to immediately ask why cant OP choose a place friend can go to as well. I feel like they would have said much the same even if OP had approached them with the exact words here. So the outcome wouldnt be friend choosing between going and order side dishes vs meeting privately. It wouldve been friend trying to convince OP to go somewhere else entirely.", "Right, all OP had to do was be honest with their friend, that's why YTA. Just be honest, not so hard.", "Yep, this is the right answer. The choice remains that person's and it remains clear you value them and want them around, but you also aren't letting their needs and wants dictate your life. \n\nBeing up front about things really does prevent a ton of drama.", "I agree 100%, I was thinking the same thing the whole time. It is always nice to get an invite still and then they can choose. I don't think OP I'd an AH, but I do think the whole situation could have been handled better. Definitely not fair for the friend to suggest he moved his dinner somewhere else.", "YTA only because you should have given the invite and let the friend decide. They could go and just eat sides and enjoy a drink and the company, making sure they ate before heading to the event. \n\nI agree that you shouldn\u2019t change your venue choice. The only thought on that front would be to add an inclusive venue that you like for after dinner for drinks or coffee/desert.", "This is exactly right! If OP had been up front about everything she would have done right by her friend. Instead she made the choice for her.", "This is the way!", "I hate when people make the decision for me that I wouldn't want to go instead of just asking and letting me decline. Is the end result the same? Yes. But my feelings around it are different.", "These comments are throwing me off. If the friend wasnt Hindu and OP simply didnt want to invite them would they still be an AH??? My friends do things with each other without me. It's called having a life. Theyre not AHs for doing things with each other that don't involve me. Yeah OP could've invited their friend out based on principle, but they decided not to and instead had a more intimate time with somebody they cared about beforehand. I'd say N A H except for the friend acting entitled about OP's restaurant choice which brings me to NTA.", "\"Hey I want to go to this place for my birthday, but I'm conscious of your dietary requirements, I've checked the menu and it doesn't seem like it was be a good spot for you, so if you want we can do something else, just the two of us another day.\"\n\nReally fuckin simple and way less insulting than making decisions for someone else and not even talking to them.", "I'm a Hindu .. if someone asks me politely that \"we r having a party at X restaurant. You r invited\" that's it end of Convo.. their job had to invite me ..my job is to accept or decline that invitation.. if they had chosen a road side stall it would NOT be insulting to me", "It's more insulting to make the decision for them then allow them to make that decision.", "If it were someone she just didn\u2019t want at her birthday, that argument makes sense.  That\u2019s not the case here.", "How?", "Yes, they can do what they like, but they might still lose friends for it.\n\nIf your choice is pork over friend, grand, enjoy the pork.\n\nIt's not that s/he's \"not allowed\", it's just it comes with social consequences. As choices always have.", "Yeah, \u201cIt\u2019s really important to me to have you celebrate my birthday with me but fair warning, I chose a restaurant that literally serves no food you can eat\u201d doesn\u2019t roll off the non-asshole tongue quite as well. Not saying he can\u2019t do whatever he wants, he can. Just makes him an AH.", "Ye exactly. Op is even less the ah in my eyes cus it's a high scale restaurant and u don't always get the chance to go to one.", "I haven\u2019t tried sesame balls, but that sounds good. Can you have the sweet potato or avocado rolls? (That\u2019s my go-to at a sushi place)", "And I don\u2019t drink but have a coke at happy hour when I want to be with my friends.", "That statement could have been purely out of anger from not bring invited. Still wrong, though.", "This is correct, but you can't exactly use what happened afterward as a \"gotcha\" for why OP shouldn't have been open about it from the beginning. The friend definitely is an AH for saying they should have picked a different restaurant, but not for being upset to not be invited at all. OP should have just been honest. Maybe the friend would have been equally upset, maybe not, but any situation in which you are purposely excluding a friend from an outing they would normally be invited to is going to cause bad feelings if you don't communicate ahead of time.", "Me too. I recently bowed out of a dinner party because it was paired food/booze courses and every single course was focused on meat and I quit drinking alcohol two years ago. I didn\u2019t want to go and sit at the table and pick at my food for five courses and drink water, so I just declined. Not a super fun choice to make, but also not for me to ask the hosts to cater to my habits.", "Or that the friend who just found out they were excluded after the fact was hurt and upset.", "yeah it def depends on the kbbq place. a lot of them charge per person and have all-you-can-eat for the dishes. i wouldn\u2019t wanna spend that much just to eat rice and kimchi", "Good to know who knew friends are", "You aren\u2019t disagreeing with me, and aren\u2019t wrong", "According to OP she sent a long message explaining everything afterwards, not just \"I didn't invite you because of the restaurant\".  It is not fine to suggest someone change how to celebrate their own anything to accommodate one person's voluntary dietary restrictions.", "What part of \"you should've picked a different restaurant\" makes you think she would've happily gone to the BBQ place?", "No she wanted OP to change the restaurant. She did not just want to go regardless. Stop changing the circumstances to suit your narrative. Op should have ideally invited her, but she went out of her way to still celebrate with her alone to show how much she cares about her and the friend still felt entitled enough to request a change of venue to the big do. OP is NTA here", "> I don't mind eating before a party\n\nExactly, OP should have mentioned beforehand that his birthday dinner would be at a KBBQ. His friend could have eaten before dinner but still met the group at the restaurant for the celebration. She might have even joined them at the tail end of the meal to join for dessert (assuming the restaurant would allow the group to squeeze in an extra chair). OP meant well but not telling her *ex ante* means that his friend felt excluded *ex post*.", "I have a friend who also doesn\u2019t eat sushi. In our experience, finding a restaurant that has good sushi and decent rice plates isn\u2019t hard.", "Especially if you're a large party with a reservation in advance (so they know you'll be spending a decent amount of money there if they can accommodate you)", "Except the friend was also being AH for saying she should have gone somewhere else for her own birthday celebration so that makes it ESH.", "Yup. Its reddit though. If there's a scrap of offence to be taken you can be certain people will run with it.", "OP did do that. She went with her to a restaurant with just the two of them the day before", "\"But you know full well that cows are sacred to me. Why would you invite me to be surrounded by people desecrating them?\"", "Good for you. I have a couple of Hindu friends who would find it insulting, given I know that they couldn't eat there.", "Oh, they might lose the friend, for sure. But that doesn't make them the AH.", "If they lose a friend because they wanted to eat pork for their birthday it wasn\u2019t a great friend to begin with.", "I see the concept of social consequences remains unpopular.", "Nah, as someone who has similar dietary restrictions to her friend (I'm Jewish, and don't eat non-Kosher meat), I get it if someone wants to go somewhere I can't eat. It's *their* birthday, they should get to go where they want.", "He spent the day with her. A whole day dedicated to celebrating with just her. That trumps everything. She was still part of the birthday celebrations. Out of the multiple other guests, a person is suppose to change their special day plans to accommodate that one\u261d\ufe0f person? It isn\u2019t her birthday and he did make it up to her. She is acting entitled.", "Bro the guy literally just wants to eat what he wants for his birthday. Do you have to be accommodating to everyone when your birthday is supposed to be about what YOU want? NTA", "I'm vegetarian and I get it. I would never expect a friend who really wanted to try out a restaurant to change venues just for me.", "I as a Hindu was thinking yta for OP, but after reading the post I am like, I want a friend like that. I wouldn't want my friend to not eat what he wants to and has been wanting to eat for months ON HIS BIRTHDAY. And OP actually spent the previous day with her at an Indian restaurant where his friend could eat anything off the menu as opposed to just a few sides in another restaurant. I see that as genuine friendship, care and respect. Wanting to celebrate his birthday at a place he wants to does not make him an AH.\n\nThe only thing I would change is that when he went with his friend he should have told her his plans and if she was still interested she could have joined them.\n\nAnd if this jeopardizes their friendship then that friend is an AH. She can only be upset on the fact that he did not tell her the plans, being upset and saying he could have chosen another restaurant is entitlement and an AH thinking.", "I would have invited her and just let her choose to attend or not but based on her response to tell OP", "And hid the fact that they were going out with everyone else. Didn't give their friend a choice, just made it for them.\n\nAnd then the friend found out after the fact.\n\nSo no they didn't actually do what I suggested which was *give their friend the option*", "Literally no one behaves like that. The person in question didn't act like that. You're just making shit up.", "Exactly. The friend has personal beliefs that clash with the activities. That's on the friend and it unfortunately is the price of having those beliefs. I dont like strip clubs and my gf wouldn't like me going, if my friends were to go to one I wouldn't. I wouldn't expect them to accommodate me. \n\nOP made the effort to celebrate with his hindu friend and by the way it sounds laid on the earlier celebration purely for her benefit. To me that's celebrating with her in a way that accommodates her belief. \n\nI have Muslim colleagues who don't drink who still come to the pub with us and drink coke, and I have others who don't come at all so we plan events that don't include alcohol in addition to what we normally do. It's part of having a belief system that limits what you can do socially/consume, you accept that you might not get to fully participate in events that involve those things.", "If they lose a friend cause their friend wants to dictate where they can eat when its not their birthday then they weren't a great friend to begin with :p", "And friend proved OP right by saying \"you should've picked a different restaurant\" and not \"I still would have liked to be included\"", "Literally no one? Ahhhhh, you're one of those...", "Ah yes because we all act perfectly reasonably when we feel hurt by our friends *actively excluding us without telling us*\n\nSomeone reacting in hurt after the fact isn't proof of anything."]}
