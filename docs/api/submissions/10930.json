If someone reaches out to ask for something she says I can do it and then texts \"call me, it's not an emergency, but important.\" Most of the time I just give in and do it, but constantly remind her how much I detest being \"voluntold\" to do something. If the person needs something that I can help provide, they can reach out to me themselves.\n\nToday, I had two missed calls and a text \"call me, not an emergency, but very important.\" So, I called her back. She told me that the youth pastor was needing another easel for the service that the youth was putting on and she said that I had one that I could bring. She asked if I would be okay with that. I said 'no.'\n\nThis immediately ticked my mom off. 'It wouldn't hurt you to bring it.'\n\n'I am not dragging it all over the place.'\n\n'It would be a big help to me.'\n\n'It would be a big help to someone else that you could have told to text or call me about it. You don't have the right to volunteer my time and my things to other people.'\n\n'What about all of the things we do for you?' For this she was starting to list off a bill she is helping me pay, and the fact we went to dinner for my birthday, or lunches that we occasionally get. I helped remodel her house, I fix her computer all the time, I clean her house, I do yard work for her because my dad is unable to, I house sit when they are on vacation (which is a lot), that is just listing a few things that I do for them.\n\n'You don't get to try and guilt trip me. The answer is no.'\n\nThis youth pastor has access to multiple different routes to get an easel. She does production work with one of the schools as well as the community theater. All that would have a spare easel (used for show postings and such) that she could borrow for the day.\n\nI don't want my things damaged or loaned out to people to wait weeks or months to get back. If the youth pastor had texted me or called me, I might have been inclined to oblige and figure out how to get my easel (which is not a small or collapsible) to and from the church. However my mom simply said that I would be happy to take it without asking me beforehand. My sister said that I don't have to readily lend my things if I don't want to.\n\nAm I the asshole for putting my footdown?", "created_utc": 1677379349, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11c3a0n/aita_for_telling_my_mom_no_for_a_church_thing/", "score": 186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Quite frankly they appear to be taking advantage of you.  You need to set limits on what and when you are available.", "NTA.

Your mother is using you to make herself look good, you don't have to comply.", "NTA my mom used to do this it got so bad i stopped going to church.

No matter if you might have agreed to it if you were asked. Giving in sometimes ensures that the cycle of being voluntold will never stop. Also, stop calling her back when you get those texts. Just text her that if she volunteered you or your stuff again, the answer is no. She's making you call her so she has more time to convince you (I _am_ guessing you would not just hang up on her). But there is no need for that when your answer is always no.\n\nBe proactive. Decide how you want to be asked for favors from now on. I imagine you don't want everyone having you phone number so you need to train your mother to text you first to ask for the favor. Let her know your preferred method and stick to the no answer unless she uses it.\n\nAnd if these phone calls are the primary times when you and your mom talk, be sure to call her on your own and make plans too spend time with her. You're not trying to cut off contact with her, just the voluntolding.", "NTA. I\u2019m a firm believer of you teach other people how they should treat you. Pay close attention to how they react when you set boundaries. Your mom clearly cares more about what other people think of her or how things will benefit her. Good on ya for finally putting your foot down.", "NTA. Your mom is also putting other folks like the youth pastor in a tough spot. It\u2019s always uncomfortable when someone volunteers another person to do a task, in the youth pastor\u2019s case it would be impolite to ask your mom if she\u2019s sure you\u2019ll bring the easel, and they have no direct contact with the person doing the favor.", "Plus this will help \"train\" other people to not expect OP's mom to speak for OP."]}
