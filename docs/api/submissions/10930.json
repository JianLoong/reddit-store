If someone reaches out to ask for something she says I can do it and then texts \"call me, it's not an emergency, but important.\" Most of the time I just give in and do it, but constantly remind her how much I detest being \"voluntold\" to do something. If the person needs something that I can help provide, they can reach out to me themselves.\n\nToday, I had two missed calls and a text \"call me, not an emergency, but very important.\" So, I called her back. She told me that the youth pastor was needing another easel for the service that the youth was putting on and she said that I had one that I could bring. She asked if I would be okay with that. I said 'no.'\n\nThis immediately ticked my mom off. 'It wouldn't hurt you to bring it.'\n\n'I am not dragging it all over the place.'\n\n'It would be a big help to me.'\n\n'It would be a big help to someone else that you could have told to text or call me about it. You don't have the right to volunteer my time and my things to other people.'\n\n'What about all of the things we do for you?' For this she was starting to list off a bill she is helping me pay, and the fact we went to dinner for my birthday, or lunches that we occasionally get. I helped remodel her house, I fix her computer all the time, I clean her house, I do yard work for her because my dad is unable to, I house sit when they are on vacation (which is a lot), that is just listing a few things that I do for them.\n\n'You don't get to try and guilt trip me. The answer is no.'\n\nThis youth pastor has access to multiple different routes to get an easel. She does production work with one of the schools as well as the community theater. All that would have a spare easel (used for show postings and such) that she could borrow for the day.\n\nI don't want my things damaged or loaned out to people to wait weeks or months to get back. If the youth pastor had texted me or called me, I might have been inclined to oblige and figure out how to get my easel (which is not a small or collapsible) to and from the church. However my mom simply said that I would be happy to take it without asking me beforehand. My sister said that I don't have to readily lend my things if I don't want to.\n\nAm I the asshole for putting my footdown?\n\nUPDATE: First of all I want to say thank you for all of the suggestions and kind words of encouragement. Got through church today and not one mention of the easel. They had gotten what they needed.\n\nThe youth pastor does have my phone number, but even she goes through my mom to ask if any member of my family is available to something, even when I'm literally standing right there.

I did it a few times to 'keep the peace' but it was severely pissing me off that my time was being volunteered for things I didn't know how to do or simply didn't want to do.

My life, my time and my things are mine, not for her to use at her discretion with the snap of her fingers. There was a lot of tension for awhile because I refused to help with anything until they stopped voluntolding me. Eventually, it worked.

What I mean by that is that your mom thinks she is entitled to have control over your life and your things.

It is why certain parents think they are entitled to access to their adult children or grandchildren.  It is why certain parents think they have a right to inject their opinions about how you are raising your children, and they even believe that they are entitled to have that opinion, validated, and followed.  It is also why certain people believe they are entitled to sexual partners.  \n\nIf you convince the world that you are entitled to access to other people, then you do not have to comply with the standard rules of economics that dictate all human interaction, which require that you offer something of value in exchange for the value you seek.\n\nFor example, an employer must pay a living wage if they want to hire employees.  Similarly, if you want to be attractive to the opposite sex, you need to work to make yourself attractive to the opposite tact, rather than simply bitching about not being able to find somebody.
