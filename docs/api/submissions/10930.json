If the person needs something that I can help provide, they can reach out to me themselves.\n\nToday, I had two missed calls and a text \"call me, not an emergency, but very important.\" So, I called her back. She told me that the youth pastor was needing another easel for the service that the youth was putting on and she said that I had one that I could bring. She asked if I would be okay with that. I said 'no.'\n\nThis immediately ticked my mom off.

If the youth pastor had texted me or called me, I might have been inclined to oblige and figure out how to get my easel (which is not a small or collapsible) to and from the church.

I did it a few times to 'keep the peace' but it was severely pissing me off that my time was being volunteered for things I didn't know how to do or simply didn't want to do. The only reason it stopped was because we had a chat about it and I told her that I would no longer do the things she volunteered me for.

In fact, it might be a good idea to stop allowing her and your dad to buy anything for you at all. She will have nothing to barter with", "NTA\n\nAnd I would like to suggest that you look up stuff about narcissistic parents and see if anything resonates.

I hate these kinds of people. Birthday dinner, lunches, things of that sort are gifts - Same with helping to pay bills unless different terms are previously specified. My grandma and mom would try and do this, and when I told her no (I was much younger at 16), I told her the same thing. My life, my time and my things are mine, not for her to use at her discretion with the snap of her fingers. There was a lot of tension for awhile because I refused to help with anything until they stopped voluntolding me. Eventually, it worked. Now, if they need help with something, they ask and if I say no, we either work something that works for the both of us, or they find another option.

She saw me as an extension of her and not as a separate person.", "NTA.  You should tell your mom you won't respond to future requests from her.", "NTA. And the term \"voluntold\" is absolute gold!", "NTA and I\u2019m totally stealing \u201cvoluntold\u201d", "NTA. Boundaries are basic. It's time to start enforcing yours.", "Not at all. You said no. I would never volunteer my brown kids for anything. You all have your own lives.", "Nta and you're nicer than me.  Nobody volunteers me for something like that.  Or anything for that matter.  My life, my choices.\nYou are the same way.  Put ur foot down and stick to it", "Pushing back is definitely the right way to go here, because the consequences for the mother is then that she is the one who people will see as the liar, or unreliable, or not delivering on \"her\" promises. And her only defence then is having to explain to these people that she hadn't actually asked OP first and is making promises without consulting OP. Either way, it becomes her reputation on the line.", "Agree 100%. Just to add that OP should remind Mom that family life isn't transactional. \"I had lunch with you, therefore you owe me your time to volunteer you for...\" isn't the way things work. If she thinks they do, it may be time to cut those off to deprive her of ammunition.", "NTA I agree with what you said but the only thing I'd do differently is tell her to tell others... I'll see what I can do... then ask you.  This way random people aren't bothering him and it saves him the hassle of saying no or being guilted by others.\n\nAlso.  LOVE the term \"Voluntold\". I'm going to add that to my vocabulary.", "Nah, have dealt with that, the consequence is that she will make you the villain. You'll either have to rectify the story every single time or move far away.\n\nI would still do it because in the long run, people need to see that she's a problem, for her to learn that she's a problem.\n\nIt's really a shitty situation", "I think you need to reread. OP *wants* people to directly ask her if they want her help. OP doesn\u2019t want mom acting as a middleman all the time.  I suspect she also doesn\u2019t want her mom constantly pressuring her to do favors for others, which would continue with your suggestion.", "NTA. Your mom likes the feeling of being the \"hero\" when people need help. But she needs to stop volunteering other people. She can help if it's that important.", "nope she is for asking.", "NTA. My mother does this all the time to my father and me -- she is happy to volunteer our time or expertise if it makes her feel like a helpful person, but it's exhausting for us.", "Your mom is one of those \"does none of the work, but wants all the credit\" type of people.\n\nYou should begin every conversation, phone call, and text message with \"No, I won't do whatever it is\" until she learns to respect your time, your effort, and your basic worth as a person.\n\nNTA.", "\"No....I don't have to explain why.  The answer is no.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou have no obligation to help out anybody, especially not help that you were volunteered for without your knowledge or consent. \n\nOn a side note this brought to mind a post I once read here about the OP's mother taking food from *their* house to donate to charity.", "The only way you will put a stop to your mother's behaviour is by saying no.\n\nMum, in future when you offer out my property and services I will say no.\n\nThen say no.\n\nIf your mother then brings up what you did for your birthday tell her you refuse to make your relationship with her transactional. No is a complete sentence.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\nNo. Your mom is being inconsiderate. My guess is she is trying to Ingratiate herself with everyone at your expense. Does she also volunteer your sister's time and things? Or does she just pick on you? Good luck. The longer you tell her no the sooner she will stop.", "NTA\n\nYou need to answering these kind of calls with \"No\" and if she starts complaining, reply with \"No is a complete sentence\" and hang up.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThat's an example of not helping her out, but making her look good/helpful.\n\nTotally different and yeah, zero obligation imo.", "It was a long time coming. Probably too long, but we only worry about things we can change here.\n\nGood for you. NTA.", "NTA but it's high time you learn to set and enforce some boundaries, aka 'say no to mommy'. You're 32, not 12.", "No your not but it's time you put up boundaries with your parents on volunteering your time for someone else's projects", "NTA and the fact that she put having dinner on your bday on the list of favors she did for you is really sad. Maybe stop doing so much for her, so she has a chance to notice and properly acknowledge your value.", "NTA", "NTA Your mom seems not to value what you do for her at all. If she pulls that crap again (what she does for you) I'd ask if she wants a bill sent to her for what you do.", "NTA.", "Not the AH. It's long past time you put your foot down. It may take time for your mother to accept your boundaries but stay firm.", "NTA. Your mom is TA.", "NTA- if you don't put your foot down, she'll never stop doing this.", "nta", "OP's Mom is the \"GO-TO\" Gal to get anything done.  Just call on OP's Mom!  She's amazing!  Always willing to help, donate, etc.  What a GREAT PERSON SHE IS!!!!!  Start the parade NOW.", "NTA Get the contact the pastor.  Find out what is needed and then say yes or no and why.  Also, inform them if they need something or help call you directly not your mom.  Tell mom the next time she does this, she can do it herself.", "Time to set boundaries. Draw them out, be consistent, and stick to them. You're going to get a LOT of push because of it, be prepared.\n\nNTA", "The whole repeat scenarios sounds infuriating! Poor op NTA", "Ah, yes, the \u201cbroken record\u201d technique. I\u2019ve used it myself multiple times. It works.", "Did you miss all the things OP does to help out her mom?", "Mom will talk about it bad daughter and how she does so much for the daughter and all she is asking is for this one thing\u2026.  It won\u2019t blow back on her.", "She's not entitled to your time or your things or your energy.", "Exactly. Especially since OP is posting here, seemingly checking whether putting her foot down this way was okay. It\u2019s unfortunate that someone recognizing a toxic dynamic and trying to change it is being discouraged for not doing it earlier.", "Likely OP will NOT be asked to do these things.  Mom is jumping up and volunteering her every time.  No one needs to ask Mom, she will just volunteer her daughter when there is a need.  I've met several of these types of people.   AAF!"]}
