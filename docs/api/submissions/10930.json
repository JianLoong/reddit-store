If the person needs something that I can help provide, they can reach out to me themselves.\n\nToday, I had two missed calls and a text \"call me, not an emergency, but very important.\" So, I called her back. She told me that the youth pastor was needing another easel for the service that the youth was putting on and she said that I had one that I could bring. She asked if I would be okay with that. I said 'no.'\n\nThis immediately ticked my mom off.

The answer is no.'\n\nThis youth pastor has access to multiple different routes to get an easel. She does production work with one of the schools as well as the community theater. All that would have a spare easel (used for show postings and such) that she could borrow for the day.\n\nI don't want my things damaged or loaned out to people to wait weeks or months to get back. If the youth pastor had texted me or called me, I might have been inclined to oblige and figure out how to get my easel (which is not a small or collapsible) to and from the church. However my mom simply said that I would be happy to take it without asking me beforehand.

No matter if you might have agreed to it if you were asked. Giving in sometimes ensures that the cycle of being voluntold will never stop. Also, stop calling her back when you get those texts.

If they needed a hand with something, she used to say \"NAME will do that for you\". The fuck I will. I did it a few times to 'keep the peace' but it was severely pissing me off that my time was being volunteered for things I didn't know how to do or simply didn't want to do. The only reason it stopped was because we had a chat about it and I told her that I would no longer do the things she volunteered me for. If she did so in future, she would have to explain why I wasn't going to do it.\n\nYou are NTA but you need to put your foot down with your mum, stop being a walkover and don't let her guilt trip you about 'buying you a meal' once in a while. In fact, it might be a good idea to stop allowing her and your dad to buy anything for you at all. She will have nothing to barter with", "NTA\n\nAnd I would like to suggest that you look up stuff about narcissistic parents and see if anything resonates.  She sees you and your belongings as an extension of herself and is overreacting when you say no.\n\nSomeone with reasonable boundaries would respect you and your autonomy and *ask* you nicely *before* confirming anything to the pastor.

I hate these kinds of people. Birthday dinner, lunches, things of that sort are gifts - Same with helping to pay bills unless different terms are previously specified. My grandma and mom would try and do this, and when I told her no (I was much younger at 16), I told her the same thing. My life, my time and my things are mine, not for her to use at her discretion with the snap of her fingers. There was a lot of tension for awhile because I refused to help with anything until they stopped voluntolding me. Eventually, it worked. Now, if they need help with something, they ask and if I say no, we either work something that works for the both of us, or they find another option.
