Figure it out!\" You're not sounding supportive. But you keep having thos attitude and she'll probably get a divorce to still get hers.

She also isn't going to have a very high paying job because her law degree (according to a comment he made, as well as comments from other lawyers) isn't going to be transferable. So she's basically starting at the bottom. What they could do is break down finances, see what she's spending money on, and try to find an equitable split of bills.

If he dies, then her share of his pension is less. Two pensions are better even if one is limited by the fact she has been out of workforce.\n\nI do think he is an AH for ultimatium rather than say maybe booking a visit with a financial advisor to show benefits and risks long term. And ironically, in many countries, a divorce could mean she is entitled to 1/2 his pension regardless. \n\nSo I understand his concerns - seeing longterm poverty ahead is a worry and income does drop on retirement usually - but think his approach isn't the best.", "If she was not there, the kid wouldn\u2019t be there either, and if she didn\u2019t stay home, she would have gotten a full time job and be contributing to expenses.", "You\u2019re right in saying he approached it incorrectly, but he\u2019s been asking her to contribute for 4 years apparently, and to no avail.
