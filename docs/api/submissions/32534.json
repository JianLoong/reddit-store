I know my wife has trouble with social interaction and they got off on a horrible start. My wife, I am going to call her Lily, was in foster care and never had a parental figure and she went hard into trying to become my mom\u2019s kid. I think it would have happened if my wife let the relationship grow naturally but she didn\u2019t take any of my warnings and bulldozed what my mom wanted.\n\nA few examples, she kept calling her \u201cmum\u201d even after she told her multiple times to call her by her name. Lily would make her uncomfortable, especially when she would ask my mom very personal question or go way too deep. I have talked to her so many times but she doesn\u2019t stop. The family has taken their concerns with me also and have straight up told her to stop.\n\nThe big turning point was when my mom and her daughters ( my sisters) went to visit deceased family member. It\u2019s a tradition between the three of them. Well Lily heard about it and went. It went very poorly and my sisters dislike Lily now also.\n\nWe are invited to events and are still in the family but the women of the family keep their distance. There is a girls trip around Christmas and she wasn\u2019t invited. This made my wife very upset and was ranting.\n\nI had enough when Lily said she was her kid. I snapped and told her my mother will never be her mom and you need to stop. She ended up crying and now I feel guilty. I just don\u2019t know how to get it through her head that she needs to stop.\n\nI\u2019ve talked with her so many times and she is already in therapy.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m getting a lot of comment, I will try to read them all and answer as much as a can. I probably won\u2019t see a questions if their isn\u2019t info in the first line\n\nAlso I have a lot of comment so if you do have a question it may have been answered already please check comments before asking.", "created_utc": 1701967101, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18czkop/aita_for_pointing_out_to_my_wife_that_my_mother/", "score": 3265, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel so sad for your wife but also for your family. I can imagine your wife thinking for a long while that once she gets married she\u2019d finally have parents. It was her last chance to get some, in her mind I\u2019m sure. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not always how life works and I don\u2019t think you were the A-H for saying what you said, it\u2019s good that you did. She can finally come to the realisation that they\u2019re never going to accept her as their own. Hopefully she\u2019ll stop trying so hard. My heart goes out to her though, maybe she should see a therapist, to help her process her childhood grief.\n\nETA : NTA", "Sure does sound like the therapy isn't at at all working, tbh.  \n\n\nI'm sure you could have been gentler to her in telling her what you did, but I'm still going NTA. It sounds like she has been warned and told SO many times, at what point does she take responsibility for her actions?", "NTA, your family are enforcing boundaries - Lily can't or won't behave appropriately towards them, so your family members are minimising her opportunities to behave inappropriately. I do feel for Lily because it must hurt a lot to have never had that kind of relationship, to see it up close and still not be able to have it, but that doesn't mean she gets to trample people's boundaries. It sounds like you've all tried to be patient about it - what you said will have hurt, but only because she hasn't accepted what's already been said to her several times by several people. If she'd been able/willing to respect what she was told before, what you said wouldn't have needed saying", "Hasn't this been posted before?", "I have 7 kids now 4 I gave birth to 2 that have married in the family and one that will be marrying into the family. I protect all of them the same. I plan girl trips for ALL the girls. My husband plans things for all the boys. We all sit around the table and play games we all talk. When people see my family picture at work and they ask if those are all my kids I say yes. So what you are describing I have no concept of. \n\nHave the women of your family tried to do things and get to know your wife?  Have they tried to get to know her one on one?", "Nta, your family set boundaries and she trampled over them.", "NTA - your wife needs some serious counseling sadly.", "Info: why is your mum so against her being close to her in the first place?", "NTA - Your family put up boundaries. You told her repeatedly about the boundaries. Your family repeatedly told her their boundaries and that she's overstepping. It sucks that she was raised in the foster system and that she has no family of her own. But as you said she tried to create a bond too quickly and forcefully, and because of that the opposite of what she wanted has happened.", "NTA - I have a lot of sympathy for kids who grow up in the system, as I did. That being said as adults it is OUR responsibility to heal from our trauma so other people don\u2019t have to heal from us. Your wife\u2019s issues with boundaries and inability to respect someone else\u2019s requests is extremely problematic and indicative that she doesn\u2019t just want a mother. \n\nShe wants an emotional crutch. \n\nMight I suggest another approach? I think a talk between your mom, yourself, and your wife where your mother lays out her boundaries, explains why she has them, and then why your wife\u2019s behavior has enforced those boundaries is necessary. It seems like your wife is getting this information in pieces, and while that should be enough, I think everyone needs to meet this head on. Clearly what y\u2019all are doing isn\u2019t enough, your wife needs to be told \u201cno\u201d very clearly and up front, and be told the consequences if she continues to press the issue. \n\nI would suggest possibly looking into another therapist, in addition to the one she currently sees, who specializes in abandonment issues, childhood PTSD, and obsessive relationships. If your wife continues on this path, I see negative effects on your relationship with your family. Giving your wife clearly feedback and clear objectives will help with this.", "Your wife needs therapy asap! Her behaviour is not normal and needs to be adressed and resolved. This is not good for herself, for you both as a couple, for your mom and for the extended family. If she dont look for help I believe this will tear your relationship.\n\nNTA.\n\nEdit: didnt see that she is already in therapy. I dont know for how long, but doesnt seem to be working. She seems to have such big unresolved problems. Maybe it will take some time... \n\nI get her past is hard, but her behaviour is creepy and kinda of stalkerish.", "I feel like slight NTA (Lily is slightly TA).\n\nI'm really curious how this was all handled when you two were dating and before she officially became a family member. If she is so desperate for a loving family (which hey, I understand that!), then I feel like she should've realized earlier on that maybe marrying into your family wasn't the right fit? (Ofc the priority should be fit with a partner, but sometimes you're marrying into a family, too).", "I\u2019m so sorry for you both. As someone who has had their own parental attachment issues therapy can take a long time. These are deep wounds that can take years to heal enough to even recognize they are there. It took me maybe 8 years of therapy to recognize that I was being delusional because there was so much shame and self hatred that clouded my vision. I was scared to look at the root and didn\u2019t even realize I was doing that because lord knows I wanted to overcome it. All that said, you are NTA. You aren\u2019t responsible for her trauma or how she reacts to it.", "I have read some of your comments on posts and there isn't really anything you can do if she isn't willing to do a joint session with you. I feel she is lying to her therapist, telling a one sided story or leaving it out all together. It might be time for you to put up the boundaries with her and your family. Maybe stop going to things for awhile, I know that isn't going to be what you want or probably your family but she isn't respecting their boundaries so she shouldn't go around them until she learns to do so.", "NTA You could've been nicer but, your wife should NOT be crossing boundaries such as this. Sorry man but she is NOT a keeper.", "NTA, it\u2019s sad what Lily has been through, but that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t have to respect boundaries. On the other hand, I do hope you have talked to your mom and sisters and asked them to be a bit kinder, more understanding, and patient with her. Hopefully therapy will help and things will smooth out over time.\nSidenote and not to be taken as a part of this particular situation since Lily had a different experience growing up, I\u2019ve always found it strange when families call their in-laws Mom and Dad. I had a bf whose mom wanted me to call her mom. I know she wanted to be kind, my mom had passed away, but for me, I have one mom, whether she is here on earth or not, and also, I\u2019m sleeping with your son, so I don\u2019t want to call HIS mom my mom, too. I could tell it hurt her feelings when I continued to call her by her name, but it just seems strange to me.", "NTA\n\nSounds like she was given plenty of polite opportunities to accept your mother's boundaries and repeatedly stomped all over them. Everyone has a limit before they snap and it sounds like you tolerated this for a long time before finally having enough", "NTA\nYour wife is desperate for that parental connection but she's really overstepping here. It may have developed over time but forcing this type of connection is not right at all. I had tje opposite problem,  my MIL  wanted me to act as and treat me as her daughter.  I was suffocated by her and took extreme measures to avoid being in her presence, I wouldn't answer the phone,  visit,  I completely withdrew for her. Your mother is feeling the exact same way I did and it's desperately unfair of your wife to impose herself on your mother like this.", "NTA\n\nLily needs a new therapist cuz the current one is not helping. She will be left with no one in her life if she continues interacting with people this way. You need to sit her down and have a very direct conversation about her actions and how it\u2019s affecting your family dynamics.", "This is a repost \u2026", "YTA for your hurtful words and for not making an effort to bridge the gap between your wife and your family.\n\nYour wife needs to accept their rejection of her but IMO, I think accepting that her married family doesn't want her will lead to her wanting to go find a family that actually welcomes her due to her trauma and your lack of participation in having the family accept her.", "So I work with kids who are TPR as a court advocate. I don't think your family are assholes, but I don't think this reflects good character on them either.\n\n\nIf you don't know what it's like to grow up and never feel wanted or loved, that's something to be grateful for. The love and security you've experienced in life should arm you with grace and compassion for those who have not been so fortunate.\n\n\nYes, even if they are weird, invasive, and overeager.\n\n\nYes, even if they don't understand boundaries.\n\n\nBecause how would they have learned these things? How could she possibly know **how** to \"just let it happen naturally?\"\n\n\nIt is a great cruelty of our society that we bring these children up with no familial love or support, and then scorn them when they do not understand and adhere to social norms. \n\n\nAre you obligated to make room in your family for these types of newcomers? Of course not. But if how you handle this type of situation is not a true reflection of your character, I don't know what is.", "NTA. And I don't understand why some comments are talking about your wife like she's a child. She's 26. Trying to brute force a relationship between her and her MIL is not a good idea.", "NTA. Lily should have reigned in her enthusiasm when she met your mother and family. She was way too eager, and definitely selfish by pushing her wants ahead of your family\u2019s boundaries. It\u2019s sad she grew up without a family, but part of belonging to a healthy family is mutual respect for boundaries and she hasn\u2019t learnt that yet.", "NTA and my heart definitely goes out to everyone. I wanted to ask if they (your mom and sisters) include your wife in activities periodically (outside of holiday events)? I understand Lily wanting family and see you mentioned her overzealous efforts have backfired, but I am hoping your mom and sisters have attempted to spend time with her. She does not need to be included in everything but it can go a long way to not feel like an outsider looking in.", "NTA, she has no respect for other peoples boundaries", "Childhood trauma doesn't give you a pass on ignoring other's boundaries.\n\nI agree this is not a complete black and white situation, but your wife needs to respect your family boundaries.\n\nIs she aware that her actions are making things worse or is she oblivious to them ? \n\nAnd I'm sorry but, when you give warnings after warnings and the other person still doesn't listen to, it's kind of normal to snap. Could you have dealt with the situation better, yes, but I still don't think your reaction makes you an AH.\n\nFinally, the therapy doesn't seem to be working. She seems to have a lot of trauma to go through.", "NTA but your family doesn\u2019t sound very loving and I hope your wife can find someone\u2019s family to accept and love her in the way she needs", "Did you ever talk to your Mom about how badly Lily wants to be a part of the family? I mean, instead of agreeing that Lily pushed too hard and needed to back off. Could you maybe ask your Mom to show her a little grace? Being called \u201cmum\u201d by your daughter in law isn\u2019t the most egregious overstepping of bounds, now is it?  Your wife IS your family. Help her integrate, rather than siding with your mom and siblings.", "ESH\n\nFrom your story, Lily is handling social interactions poorly because of her past. For the sake of this sub, she's an AH because she's been told to stop certain simple behaviors and she isn't.\n\nBut also from your story, you and your family seem awfully rigid and unforgiving. Lily called your mum \"mum\" instead of her name, which she preferred? Oh, the horror! I mean, ok, she should have stopped, but this is hardly turning up drunk to her 60th birthday and vomiting on the cake. \n\nNowhere in your post do I see any attempt or even any thought that maybe you all cut Lily some slack because she's a member of your family now and trying hard (but imperfectly) to be one. Nowhere in your post did i see any reference to how you prepared your family to meet Lily, if her norms are so different. You and your family seem to need to perhaps approach all this with some kindness and understanding and tolerance - even if Lily hadn't had her childhood, she'd have different behavioral norms that your family might not be used to. You all seem to expect that Lily should be the one doing all the compromising.", "NTA. Though I will I've heard of people calling in laws mom or dad. But this sounds like it goes beyond that. Since you've talked to her and she's in therapy, I don't know what to suggest.", "NTA but you could have handled better. I am interested to know if you explained Lilies upbringing to your family? Of course she is exuberant who wouldn\u2019t be, she wants a family so she rushed in. I think you need to have a sit down conversation with your whole family and explain her reasons for her behavior. They need to be more tolerant and Lily needs to back off as well and give them space.", "NAH - Lilly is clearly really hurting here, so I don't think I can call her TA.  She wants a family so badly.  Hopefully after your talk, she will understand that she can't force herself into this family.  Growing up in foster care, I'm sure she learned that you have to put in effort to get the love and attention that you need.  I'm not sure she learned where those boundaries are, or when it's too much effort.  She's learning some lessons now that she didn't get a chance to learn when she was younger.  I can sense the broken desperation of an unloved child.  It's hard.  She needs to back off, but she also needs to be shown some grace.  \n\nYour family are not TA for not treating her like a daughter/sister.  People get to decide how much they'd like to welcome a new in-law.  It's clear they're trying to be polite, but are also super uncomfortable with the way your wife is behaving. \n\nYou're not TA.  You're trying to keep the peace and keep everyone happy.  \n\nHopefully your wife will continue with therapy.  It sounds like she has a lot of new stuff to process.", "I'm gonna say borderline NTA, but you came really close to AH behavior. Now, maybe I have this wrong, but it reads like you keep telling her to stop, but you didn't actually have any discussions with her about it. You don't seem to have made any effort to understand why your wife keeps trying to force a relationship with your mom other than understanding she grew up without a mom.   \n\n\nAgain, I don't think you're the AH even though you snapped at her, but I think you need to have a therapy session WITH your wife where you discuss how this is affecting you as a couple. I'd be willing to bet that your wife is not actually telling her therapist about all the times she has tried to force the issue.", "NAH, but \n\n> There is a girls trip around Christmas and she wasn\u2019t invited.\n\nThat is kind of asshole-ish. I will never understand people who exclude others because they want too much to be liked.\n\nEdit: the top comment right now agrees with me. People downvoting me are very confused about what they feel.", "My mother died less than a year after my marriage. I lived in a different country and barely spoke the language. Upon returning, my MIL touched my cheek and said, \"Don't worry darling, I'm your mama now.\" \n\nKnowing your wife's background, your family seem cold and cruel. Not every family's dynamics are the same and it's a shame that this wasn't talked about before the wedding. NAH but unfortunately I'm afraid your wife will have to make some decisions if this is the family she wants to deal with for the rest of her life.", "I feel so sad for your wife. She probably feels that she is not worthy of being loved. The one hope she holds on growing up that one day she would have a family who welcome her, love her and accept her has been completely smashed. The only one that she has is you, and although I understand your point of view, she must feel so lonely and in pain right now. I fear that her mental health might decline as she hits another mile stone in this grief process.\n\nOne of the thing I noticed though is that you don't mention your family even trying to make her feel welcome. The language you are using towards your mother is nearly saintly, but the one you use towards your wife has no positives connotations. I wonder if you have even considered that your family could have been more understanding and welcoming towards your wife. To me they seem cold, but that is probably the way my brain works. Going to the relative home was probably to show support and kindness to your family, and it back fire on her. \n\nYes your wife sounds desperate to be finally accepted and loved, and that can be much to handle. I understand that this could be irritating for your family. However the way they are at the moment, making it clear to her that she will never be accepted as part of the family, is not great. \n\nI also wonder if your wife might be on the autistic spectrum or maybe having ADHD. Just a thought, which could  explain the intensity (love bombing) that can occur.\n\nI think that things could have been handled much better by all concerned. I don't think the situation is easy. \n\nI think everyone is hurt, and hopefully the therapist can help everyone move forward. NAH", "your mom and sisters sound like complete nightmares.  Your poor, poor wife is over here just desperately wanting a mom and some sisters (omg i almost cried just typing that) and her own husband wont even support her.", "Do you even like your wife?

(Yeah, really crazy, right?)\n\nHow about talking with your mom.  Yeah, Lily sounds a bit needy.  But your mom could have done a lot worse.  Lots of moms have DILs who compete with them (or who they compete with).  DILs who exclude the more than they want to be excluded.  DILs who they feel pull their sons away.  If you all keep pushing Lily to get back into  her corner you may find she opts out entirely.  How will your next wife get along with your mother?\n\nLily craves a family.  She apparently had the wild notion she was marrying into one.  Meanwhile, your mom and sisters sound like they're pretty cold things.  It doesn't sound like you're much help.", "NTA.

You\u2019re her husband. Be her husband. You can\u2019t sit here and assume that you know what\u2019s happening. There\u2019s a reason she\u2019s trying so hard. Don\u2019t be a son, be a husband and help your wife. You sound like the AH because it sounds like you\u2019re taking your family\u2019s side and not a Lilly\u2019s. Your mother and siblings need to learn compassion. Sounds like they lack it as well.", "ESH.  It seems like everyone is just doing whatever they want, and nobody is bothering to compromise and discuss this like adults. \n\nLilly sucks for pushing too hard, especially when she was told to stop.  But, you suck also because it sounds like you KNEW Lilly going on the trip to visit the deceased relative was a bad idea, and yet you did nothing to stop it.  Or tell Lilly she shouldn't go, *and HELP her read the room - bulldozing your way into a delicate family tradition could have been 100% avoided.*   \n\nI would suggest that you meet with her therapist on your own, and explain the situation from you and your family's perspective.  Maybe her therapist can talk her through it and how to appropriately react.", "I feel like I've read this exact same AITA before", "Have you tried talking to your mother to ask why she feels this way about your wife?", "ESH.

Yes, harsh and blunt but the solution IMO.", "YTA. My mom didn\u2019t have any daughters. She was so excited when I introduced my then GF. My mom likes my wife more than me. Your mom is the AH too.

They are important to me because they are important to my son.  Two of them went through divorce.  I made sure they knew our home was a safe place during their times of uncertainty.  Your family\u2019s treatment of your wife is atrocious.   If she is the one you are choosing to spend the rest of your life with, they should want to be invested in her.  When my son chooses a wife, I hope she wants to be part of our family, not just his wife.", "ESH but Lily the least. I don\u2019t care if I get downvoted but Lily needs to leave you and your family and find one that gives a fuck about her.

How soon after meeting did you get married? How come your family didn\u2019t get a chance to bond with her? Did you put any effort into facilitating a space where the relationship can grow?

Your wife has bought in and wants to be viewed as part of the family. I understand that goes against what your mom wants, but it doesn't sound like Lily has done much other than try to get to know your mom personally, and wants to participate in family rituals. I think your family is lucky to have someone like Lily, who from your writing, is just making an effort to become a part of the family. I think you and your family need to take a second and think about what you want out of your wife. Do you want her to simply be your spouse and have your family treat her like an outsider, or do you want her to feel welcomed and involved in the family. Also calling her mother-in-law \"mum\" definitely shouldn't be considered weird or bad if she's on good terms with her. Unless Lily did something truly awful to get on the bad side of your mom, I feel the reason for their bad relationship is because you and your family have a cold outlook on family.", "Dayyyyum, so poor Lily who grew up in foster care never had a family of her own, probably feeling like a rejected outcast.  Now she has a family (or should because hello?  You're her family) and she's still being treated like a rejected outcast.  YTA.

She is trying her hardest to be accepted by your family, but truly she should say fuck them and fuck you. I understand that your family has boundaries, but she is looking for guidance in this life that is provided by a mother-in-law and sister-in-laws. For you to allow your mother and sisters to exclude her is disrespectful and mean as fuck. When you marry the man, you marry the family and your family is terrible. they never liked her from the beginning. It was never about her, forcing the relationship, it was about her background.

I know my wife has trouble with social interaction and they got off on a horrible start. My wife, I am going to call her Lily, was in foster care and never had a parental figure and she went hard into trying to become my mom\u2019s kid. I think it would have happened if my wife let the relationship grow naturally but she didn\u2019t take any of my warnings and bulldozed what my mom wanted.\n\nA few examples, she kept calling her \u201cmum\u201d even after she told her multiple times to call her by her name. Lily would make her uncomfortable, especially when she would ask my mom very personal question or go way too deep. I have talked to her so many times but she doesn\u2019t stop. The family has taken their concerns with me also and have straight up told her to stop.\n\nThe big turning point was when my mom and her daughters ( my sisters) went to visit deceased family member. It\u2019s a tradition between the three of them. Well Lily heard about it and went. It went very poorly and my sisters dislike Lily now also.\n\nWe are invited to events and are still in the family but the women of the family keep their distance. There is a girls trip around Christmas and she wasn\u2019t invited. This made my wife very upset and was ranting.\n\nI had enough when Lily said she was her kid. I snapped and told her my mother will never be her mom and you need to stop. She ended up crying and now I feel guilty. I just don\u2019t know how to get it through her head that she needs to stop.\n\nI\u2019ve talked with her so many times and she is already in therapy.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She needed to be told, but it sounds like a sad situation for everyone involved. If your mum and sisters can empathise somewhat with your wife, it may be helpful if they could tell her and set boundaries.

She\u2019s definitely overstepping but like idk it sounds like they could be kinder. She never had a family dude and legally like y\u2019all are family now.

It sounds like you don't care if your family dislikes your wife, and just think she should deal with it. You're lucky she even sees your family as something to try and put effort in.

Expecting you to make your family treat her how she wants even after she continues to treat them how she wishes. At some point, empathy gives way to seeing this is more than trauma, and she doesn't want to change but expects others to do the changes.

You can easily see evidence (but what you see is just a drop in the bucket) of what she went through just by looking at how she navigates her world. \n\nYour family is obviously very close. How would all of you feel if you were suddenly ripped away from each other and forced to live with strangers that were cruel, neglectful and abusive and probably signed up for this arrangement for a paycheck and not to actually care for you all? You all need to think honestly about that one for a very long time.\n\nYour wife\u2019s lack of social skills and her neediness and desperation to be loved by your family clearly shows that whomever was responsible for her well-being denied her any emotional support, approval, validation, affection\u2026etc. \n\nHow do you learn social cues and patterns of conversation and common boundaries when you were neglected and rejected and abandoned and ignored and abused your entire childhood? \n\nEmpathy is when you put your cruel judgements of people to the side for a second and give them some slack for god sakes. \n\nAll of you need to put your shortsighted, self absorbed, heartless opinions and criticisms of her away for good and find your kindness and love and compassion for another human being in desperate need of that. \n\nYou and your family are privileged. That means you have something in your lives that allows you to move through this world with never having to deal with problems that other people that don\u2019t have what you do have to struggle with everyday.\n\nYour privilege is love and family. \n\nSomeone that has never had that struggles through life and thinking about how mean your family is to her and how you allow it and now you have fully joined their side. \n\nNo wonder she is crying. I don\u2019t know you people but I have tears starting to burn my eyes.\n\nWith all that love floating around in your family, isn\u2019t there enough to let her have a little taste of it? It\u2019s like she is still in foster care waiting for a family to think she is lovable and worthwhile and has value in this world. When will she be good enough to get that?\n\nAs far as I am concerned, you and your family should be ashamed with yourselves, especially you. \n\nHere you have a wife that knows nothing in this life except rejection and emotional pain, and when your family acts cruel towards her like she isn\u2019t good enough to be kind to, to be understanding of, or to remind themselves to be thankful for the life they have had that came to them not by hard work but by happenstance, you betray her anc side with your family. \n\nShe meets you and marries you and is excited to finally have the family she has been dreaming of her whole life and instead she gets the Ebenezer Scrooge family, penny pinching their their love and kindness instead of money which makes you guys so much worse than a horrible, fictional Dickens character.\n\nIn fact, you guys are like Fagin, Miss Havisham, and that horrible man from David Copperfield rolled into one and if you aren\u2019t very familiar with Dickens, just know that it\u2019s very bad.\n\nHonestly, if you all get so bent over her lack of social skills then use your heads instead of your snap judgments. \n\nWe learn those things from our parents. \n\nShe has let your mom know in a million different ways how desperate she is for a mother. If your mom could get over herself and fill that role and treat your wife like one of her own, teaching your wife the things she never learned like gently teaching her social cues and boundaries (and bunch of other wonderful qualities that your mom isn\u2019t showing she has) would make all the difference in the world.\n\nI\u2019m going to be honest. \n\nI would be a little worried if I were you of your wife starting to self harm or to become suicidal at some point in her life. \n\nThis is where you use empathy again.\n\nIs a life without ever being loved (you aren\u2019t showing her that either) worth living? \n\nBeing dismissive of what she has been through in her life and ignoring your own privilege of not dealing with what she struggles with everyday is the most f***ed up s*** I have heard in a long time. \n\nYou and your family should get some rest because you are going to be visited by 3 ghost one night very soon (yep still stuck on Dickens. URIAH! That\u2019s the bad guy from DC).\n\nTurn the boat around and do the right thing. \n\nYou give your family a book report version of what I have said here and you give it like one of those dramatic preachers putting the fear of the fire and the brimstone into their congregation every Sunday. They need to find their heart, because that where we keep the empathy, compassion, and kindness they have been denying your wife for no god damn good reason.\n\nYou have a lot of apologizing to do yourself. \n\nAnd tell your mom congratulations. It\u2019s a girl and inform her that she has the opportunity to completely change another human beings life for the better. \n\nPeople that receive the gift of love from someone that isn\u2019t obligated to according to our society appreciate it and they take it and put it out into world. A lot of they do that by showing their children the love that others have shown them.\n\nIf your family can\u2019t come to Jesus, see the light, and get their s*** together by Christmas Eve, then you end those relationships because you need to be shielding your wife from how they treat her. \n\nMaybe not zero contact but no more holidays together or birthdays. \n\nYou limit contact and never bring them up in conversation with your wife. She has been through 50 lifetimes worth of pain, so for the rest of your life it\u2019s your job to do everything you can to shield her from anymore.\n\nShe may not get the mother she dreamed of, but she will have a husband that saw all her damage that others have done to her but it was her worth and her value that he finally started seeing and that is love and that kind of love is real and can make up for a lifetime of never knowing what it felt like.\n\nShe deserves that and she needs that. Be the one that came along and changed everything by learning how to truly love your wife. \n\nBe grateful for her everyday, because while abuse and trauma damages us, we take pieces of that and turn them into strength and special abilities you normally people don\u2019t have. Go watch her. You will see what I\u2019m talking about.

Does she show any of the same behavior in other situations, or is this specific to your family? \n\nAlso, in regards to the therapist - I would consider whether her unwillingness to do joint sessions with you might be because she's misrepresenting the situation to her therapist. Because she's making zero progress here and is in fact constantly working against her own interests, and if therapy isn't helping you do have to wonder why.

Even after that she kept pressing and pressing, and his mother is supposed to what? Lay down and take it because \u201coooh daughter in law\u201d? It\u2019s simply weird how you express you wouldn\u2019t marry into a family that healthily expresses they\u2019re uncomfortable with a person.", "Yeah I have sympathy for her troubled childhood, but she sounds like a huge weirdo.", "One of the personal questions was literally asking her MIL for bedroom tips", "You know maybe she doesn\u2019t want to be called mom, let her call you another name as a term endearment. She was asking questions about sex, maybe she needed some advice. Heck my daughter talks to me about sex, and she asks me questions all the time. Yes I might be uncomfortable if my DIL asks me. But. But I would hope she would be comfortable enough to want to come to me and we could get past our discomfort.", "OP, you need to add this to your post, along with other examples.\n\nThis is so off the wall that I can see why they avoid her.\n\nETA: Talk about burying the lede", "It seems to me that some folks are getting stuck on \"moms have to mom\" and others are looking at it more like any other relationship between adults. \n\nIt doesn't sound like your mom wants to have no contact or no relationship at all. Rather, due to her personality and way of being, she has certain expectations and preferences for that relationship. Your wife has different expectations for that same relationship. This happens all the time, but if you take \"mom\" out of it, we'd generally defer to the person with less/more limited expectations. You can be friends with someone without having to date them, just because they really want to date you and never really had a girlfriend before. \n\nI don't have kids but I know that we teach kids they don't have to kiss grandma or let auntie hug them if they don't want to, because that's their right. Flip this around to an awkward and line-crossing mother-in-law forcing a relationship with the wife and see how it feels. \"I went out with my mom and sister and my MIL just showed up at the restaurant!\" \"I keep asking her to call me Michelle, but my MIL insists on calling me Shelly!\" \"I really liked my MIL until she started coming over all the time and telling me what to do, because she says she's my mom now. My own mom doesn't even call me that often!\"\n\nLove and relationships come in many different ways, but they all should include respect. I don't call my MIL \"mom\" even though we're very close. Our relationship is different than my relationship with my mother and similarly I understand and respect when my MIL and SIL do things on their own when MIL is in town. I call my good friend's mom, \"mom\" and there are some things I'd talk to her that I wouldn't talk to my mom about, but she is far from a warm \"mommy\" mom (like my own is). My mom and I can spend hours talking and she's the best person to turn to for advice. MIL doesn't prefer that, and gets stressed about difficult situations. I'm not going to force her to change because my mom expectations may be different. NTA. Your mom is human.", "She overstepped. The in laws should be sympathetic but that doesn\u2019t mean Lily can do a coup of the family.", "It's possible his mother and sisters are colder and less welcoming than usual (I'm getting *not one of us* vibes). My family isn't as exclusive - even my friends call my mother 'mumma' so in a different context, his wife probably wouldn't come across strangely at all. She's trying to make herself part of the family...in another family, she wouldn't have to try - people would make space for her gladly.\n\nHe calls his mother's attitude towards his wife as 'polite' - I'm polite to my postman, I'd like to think I'm much more than that towards family members.\n\nYou've got two extremes at play but that doesn't automatically make your wife the weirdo and your family the pinnacle of normalcy. It takes more than therapy to address certain wounds and gaps...a warm, welcoming family that isn't hell bent on exclusivity would have done wonders. Sure, they don't *have* to and I guess that's what we're going with.", "Man, I don't have a mother and I feel like everyone is trying be my mom and I don't want one. I should give out these people's contact info", "Look, this is all anecdotal but I don't know a single person who refers to their in laws as mom and dad. Based on the post I'm making the assumption OP is in the UK or Australia - I don't think this is as common as some people are making it out to be. If you pair it with the other very bizarre oversteps (asking MIL for sex advice...???) it comes across a lot creepier. This isn't about \"more accepting families\" this is about her trying to force them to be a surrogate for her biological family. It's sad and she needs better help IMO so she can work thru her grief more effectively.", "omg dont accept OPs faux-psycho analysis. he thinks calling her mom is some kinda messed up thing. get real. \n\nshes the daughter in law. his wife. she IS part of the family.", "Right..probably like ripping the wound open. It concerns me that OP doesn\u2019t \u201cunderstand the fixation\u201d though..what don\u2019t you get? The same way ppl cry their whole lives for a spouse, for babies, for deceased partners, for money, for a cure, etc is the way she\u2019s been crying her whole life for a mom. It\u2019s not rocket science. She has issues!", "That is definitely a faux pas, but it\u2019s not something that MIL can\u2019t get over.", "Yo do you wanna adopt a 20+ yr old guy T_T", "Yeah, and if she gets help finding what she needs emotionally she may be able to see her errors and work to build rapport with her inlaws. \n\nI have a feeling this family is pretty enmeshed with each other, and she is probably now the scapegoat.  Her neediness and their enmeshment is a bad combo. \n\nI married into a large family and the newest sister-in-law always got creamed by the mom and the sisters.  It was a fun family if you were not the newest outsider.  Holy enmeshment, batman.", "I see your point, but many MIL would be delighted to be called \"mom\" by their DIL and have that DIL volunteer to participate in family traditions.  In my family whenever someone gets a significant other (even dating, not waiting until they marry in), they are immediately included in all the traditions as though they were always a kid in the family.  Obviously in this story she is pushing boundaries and that on its own is not good, but it is also true that her hopes for familial connections and the in-laws' hopes for familial connections are not compatible at all, and IMHO that is the cause of most of the pain here.", "Just because you don't have the capacity for compassion doesn't mean there aren't others who do.", "It\u2019s always interesting to me how strained relationships with parents manifest. My ex wanted his family to be seen as my family when we were only dating for a year, and me with my terrible relationship with my family basically said \u201cfamily means nothing to me and your family is definitely not mine, I don\u2019t care about them at all.\u201d Obviously the relationship didn\u2019t last as our priorities were so different. But just interesting that one side of the spectrum can be \u201cI NEED A FAMILY BECAUSE I NEVER HAD MY OWN\u201d and another be \u201cI\u2019ve never known family, therefore I have no desire to have one.\u201d", "I agree with you on this. I'm stunned at people blaming his mother and her family for this.", "I sent a longer private message, hope that is ok. \n\nSearch terms: \"complicated bereavement\", \"chronic grief\", \"how to work through the processes of grief\" (or \"tasks of grief\"). That should hopefully bring up enough to start with.", "As someone with depression, yes. It's part of being an adult. I have to deal with it so it doesn't affect my loved ones around me. That doesn't mean I have to deal with it myself. A family who loves and supports you will be there the days you slip. If you're not actually doing the work in getting your issue under control your loved ones will notice you're not and will pull away because they can't forever be carrying your burdens. They also have their own shit to deal with and having to deal with yours constantly on top of it is not going endear you to them. They will get burnt out and eventually either burn up dealing with you or drop the rope and not deal with you for their own sakes.", "Thank you!!!! I tried searching but no luck, and I had so many other things to do", "Please sir, may I have some more sex tips?", "Someone who was a foster kid is worried about someone in their life getting close to their therapist, that makes a lot of sense. My parents (bio) used therapy abuse me further, so I can understand why she may be wary. You don't know what she's been through. (she does need to work through this more, though.)\n\nAlso, trying to quickly get close to someone who is a mom figure makes a lot of sense for a person who was in foster care and might have been a way to try to create stability. It sounds like Lily has a lot of abandonment trauma. Foster kids also often don't have the luxury of boundaries or privacy, unfortunately. \n\nNot excusing Lily here, but these actions actually make plenty of sense. I wonder if she might need a therapist who specializes in supporting now adult foster kids? She sounds like she never felt like she had a family or really belonged to a family-like unit until she married OP and she doesn't understand how one works. \n\nPoor Lily sounds like she's desperate for love and belonging. I hope she and OP can work through this to figure things out better. I feel so bad for her.", "I would not do this without the wife's permission. My Mom used to get way to involved with my psychiatrists and therapists when I was almost an adult, and I hated it. It feels like a violation.", "This. Also I\u2019d love to know what went down on the trip with the mom and sisters where it went \u201cvery poorly\u201d, I\u2019d think since she is family she would be invited anyway? So why does she have to invite herself? Calling your MIL \u201cmum\u201d isn\u2019t unheard of even in 2023. And sure it may have slipped up again but I\u2019m guessing bc she was expecting to call her that for a while pre marriage? (I don\u2019t call my MIL mom but it\u2019s definitely still a thing).\n\nIdk I\u2019m not seeing enough evidence to judge the wife on where she explicitly crossed a boundary. Also how long has this been going on? And not being invited to the girls trip is really sad like what the heck did \u201cLily\u201d do?! Bc what im reading isn\u2019t insufferable imo.

He would tell me what I had to do for him to keep him clam.  (I was 12 years younger than him and had sane and loving parents and did not know the was not how therapy worked.)

They are not like you and I. Their minds don't work or think like we do. Educate your family. Educate yourself. I was raised typical middle class suburbs. Was clueless to the issues that those in foster care face. And the mental struggles they have is astounding. The mental illness they are brought up in and faced with is brutal, and very real. I is extremely difficult to forgive the things that are said and done, but by educating yourself, you better understand why they are. Compassion comes much easier.", "Wasn\u2019t this a huge red flag for you - her asking your mom for bedroom tips (on you ) on her first meeting ? This is way beyond her wanting a mom in your mother. You have much bigger problems with her social awareness. Also your mom has 2 daughters that she is presumably close to already.
