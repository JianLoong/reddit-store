I know my wife has trouble with social interaction and they got off on a horrible start. My wife, I am going to call her Lily, was in foster care and never had a parental figure and she went hard into trying to become my mom\u2019s kid. I think it would have happened if my wife let the relationship grow naturally but she didn\u2019t take any of my warnings and bulldozed what my mom wanted.\n\nA few examples, she kept calling her \u201cmum\u201d even after she told her multiple times to call her by her name. Lily would make her uncomfortable, especially when she would ask my mom very personal question or go way too deep. I have talked to her so many times but she doesn\u2019t stop. The family has taken their concerns with me also and have straight up told her to stop.\n\nThe big turning point was when my mom and her daughters ( my sisters) went to visit deceased family member. It\u2019s a tradition between the three of them. Well Lily heard about it and went. It went very poorly and my sisters dislike Lily now also.\n\nWe are invited to events and are still in the family but the women of the family keep their distance. There is a girls trip around Christmas and she wasn\u2019t invited. This made my wife very upset and was ranting.\n\nI had enough when Lily said she was her kid. I snapped and told her my mother will never be her mom and you need to stop. She ended up crying and now I feel guilty. I just don\u2019t know how to get it through her head that she needs to stop.\n\nI\u2019ve talked with her so many times and she is already in therapy.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m getting a lot of comment, I will try to read them all and answer as much as a can. I probably won\u2019t see a questions if their isn\u2019t info in the first line\n\nAlso I have a lot of comment so if you do have a question it may have been answered already please check comments before asking.", "created_utc": 1701967101, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18czkop/aita_for_pointing_out_to_my_wife_that_my_mother/", "score": 337, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel so sad for your wife but also for your family. I can imagine your wife thinking for a long while that once she gets married she\u2019d finally have parents. It was her last chance to get some, in her mind I\u2019m sure. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not always how life works and I don\u2019t think you were the A-H for saying what you said, it\u2019s good that you did. She can finally come to the realisation that they\u2019re never going to accept her as their own. Hopefully she\u2019ll stop trying so hard. My heart goes out to her though, maybe she should see a therapist, to help her process her childhood grief.\n\nETA : NTA", "Sure does sound like the therapy isn't at at all working, tbh.  \n\n\nI'm sure you could have been gentler to her in telling her what you did, but I'm still going NTA. It sounds like she has been warned and told SO many times, at what point does she take responsibility for her actions?", "NTA, your family are enforcing boundaries - Lily can't or won't behave appropriately towards them, so your family members are minimising her opportunities to behave inappropriately. I do feel for Lily because it must hurt a lot to have never had that kind of relationship, to see it up close and still not be able to have it, but that doesn't mean she gets to trample people's boundaries. It sounds like you've all tried to be patient about it - what you said will have hurt, but only because she hasn't accepted what's already been said to her several times by several people. If she'd been able/willing to respect what she was told before, what you said wouldn't have needed saying", "Hasn't this been posted before?", "I have 7 kids now 4 I gave birth to 2 that have married in the family and one that will be marrying into the family. I protect all of them the same. I plan girl trips for ALL the girls. My husband plans things for all the boys. We all sit around the table and play games we all talk. When people see my family picture at work and they ask if those are all my kids I say yes. So what you are describing I have no concept of. \n\nHave the women of your family tried to do things and get to know your wife?  Have they tried to get to know her one on one?", "Nta, your family set boundaries and she trampled over them.", "NTA - your wife needs some serious counseling sadly.", "Info: why is your mum so against her being close to her in the first place?", "NTA - Your family put up boundaries. You told her repeatedly about the boundaries. Your family repeatedly told her their boundaries and that she's overstepping. It sucks that she was raised in the foster system and that she has no family of her own. But as you said she tried to create a bond too quickly and forcefully, and because of that the opposite of what she wanted has happened.", "NTA - I have a lot of sympathy for kids who grow up in the system, as I did. That being said as adults it is OUR responsibility to heal from our trauma so other people don\u2019t have to heal from us. Your wife\u2019s issues with boundaries and inability to respect someone else\u2019s requests is extremely problematic and indicative that she doesn\u2019t just want a mother. \n\nShe wants an emotional crutch. \n\nMight I suggest another approach? I think a talk between your mom, yourself, and your wife where your mother lays out her boundaries, explains why she has them, and then why your wife\u2019s behavior has enforced those boundaries is necessary. It seems like your wife is getting this information in pieces, and while that should be enough, I think everyone needs to meet this head on. Clearly what y\u2019all are doing isn\u2019t enough, your wife needs to be told \u201cno\u201d very clearly and up front, and be told the consequences if she continues to press the issue. \n\nI would suggest possibly looking into another therapist, in addition to the one she currently sees, who specializes in abandonment issues, childhood PTSD, and obsessive relationships. If your wife continues on this path, I see negative effects on your relationship with your family. Giving your wife clearly feedback and clear objectives will help with this.", "Your wife needs therapy asap! Her behaviour is not normal and needs to be adressed and resolved. This is not good for herself, for you both as a couple, for your mom and for the extended family. If she dont look for help I believe this will tear your relationship.\n\nNTA.\n\nEdit: didnt see that she is already in therapy. I dont know for how long, but doesnt seem to be working. She seems to have such big unresolved problems. Maybe it will take some time... \n\nI get her past is hard, but her behaviour is creepy and kinda of stalkerish.", "I feel like slight NTA (Lily is slightly TA).\n\nI'm really curious how this was all handled when you two were dating and before she officially became a family member. If she is so desperate for a loving family (which hey, I understand that!), then I feel like she should've realized earlier on that maybe marrying into your family wasn't the right fit? (Ofc the priority should be fit with a partner, but sometimes you're marrying into a family, too).", "I\u2019m so sorry for you both. As someone who has had their own parental attachment issues therapy can take a long time. These are deep wounds that can take years to heal enough to even recognize they are there. It took me maybe 8 years of therapy to recognize that I was being delusional because there was so much shame and self hatred that clouded my vision. I was scared to look at the root and didn\u2019t even realize I was doing that because lord knows I wanted to overcome it. All that said, you are NTA. You aren\u2019t responsible for her trauma or how she reacts to it.", "I have read some of your comments on posts and there isn't really anything you can do if she isn't willing to do a joint session with you. I feel she is lying to her therapist, telling a one sided story or leaving it out all together. It might be time for you to put up the boundaries with her and your family. Maybe stop going to things for awhile, I know that isn't going to be what you want or probably your family but she isn't respecting their boundaries so she shouldn't go around them until she learns to do so.", "NTA You could've been nicer but, your wife should NOT be crossing boundaries such as this. Sorry man but she is NOT a keeper.", "NTA, it\u2019s sad what Lily has been through, but that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t have to respect boundaries. On the other hand, I do hope you have talked to your mom and sisters and asked them to be a bit kinder, more understanding, and patient with her. Hopefully therapy will help and things will smooth out over time.\nSidenote and not to be taken as a part of this particular situation since Lily had a different experience growing up, I\u2019ve always found it strange when families call their in-laws Mom and Dad. I had a bf whose mom wanted me to call her mom. I know she wanted to be kind, my mom had passed away, but for me, I have one mom, whether she is here on earth or not, and also, I\u2019m sleeping with your son, so I don\u2019t want to call HIS mom my mom, too. I could tell it hurt her feelings when I continued to call her by her name, but it just seems strange to me.", "NTA\n\nSounds like she was given plenty of polite opportunities to accept your mother's boundaries and repeatedly stomped all over them. Everyone has a limit before they snap and it sounds like you tolerated this for a long time before finally having enough", "NTA\nYour wife is desperate for that parental connection but she's really overstepping here. It may have developed over time but forcing this type of connection is not right at all. I had tje opposite problem,  my MIL  wanted me to act as and treat me as her daughter.  I was suffocated by her and took extreme measures to avoid being in her presence, I wouldn't answer the phone,  visit,  I completely withdrew for her. Your mother is feeling the exact same way I did and it's desperately unfair of your wife to impose herself on your mother like this.", "NTA\n\nLily needs a new therapist cuz the current one is not helping. She will be left with no one in her life if she continues interacting with people this way. You need to sit her down and have a very direct conversation about her actions and how it\u2019s affecting your family dynamics.", "This is a repost \u2026", "YTA for your hurtful words and for not making an effort to bridge the gap between your wife and your family.\n\nYour wife needs to accept their rejection of her but IMO, I think accepting that her married family doesn't want her will lead to her wanting to go find a family that actually welcomes her due to her trauma and your lack of participation in having the family accept her.", "So I work with kids who are TPR as a court advocate. I don't think your family are assholes, but I don't think this reflects good character on them either.\n\n\nIf you don't know what it's like to grow up and never feel wanted or loved, that's something to be grateful for. The love and security you've experienced in life should arm you with grace and compassion for those who have not been so fortunate.\n\n\nYes, even if they are weird, invasive, and overeager.\n\n\nYes, even if they don't understand boundaries.\n\n\nBecause how would they have learned these things? How could she possibly know **how** to \"just let it happen naturally?\"\n\n\nIt is a great cruelty of our society that we bring these children up with no familial love or support, and then scorn them when they do not understand and adhere to social norms. \n\n\nAre you obligated to make room in your family for these types of newcomers? Of course not. But if how you handle this type of situation is not a true reflection of your character, I don't know what is.", "NTA. And I don't understand why some comments are talking about your wife like she's a child. She's 26. Trying to brute force a relationship between her and her MIL is not a good idea.", "NTA. Lily should have reigned in her enthusiasm when she met your mother and family. She was way too eager, and definitely selfish by pushing her wants ahead of your family\u2019s boundaries. It\u2019s sad she grew up without a family, but part of belonging to a healthy family is mutual respect for boundaries and she hasn\u2019t learnt that yet.", "NTA and my heart definitely goes out to everyone. I wanted to ask if they (your mom and sisters) include your wife in activities periodically (outside of holiday events)? I understand Lily wanting family and see you mentioned her overzealous efforts have backfired, but I am hoping your mom and sisters have attempted to spend time with her. She does not need to be included in everything but it can go a long way to not feel like an outsider looking in.", "NTA, she has no respect for other peoples boundaries", "Childhood trauma doesn't give you a pass on ignoring other's boundaries.\n\nI agree this is not a complete black and white situation, but your wife needs to respect your family boundaries.\n\nIs she aware that her actions are making things worse or is she oblivious to them ? \n\nAnd I'm sorry but, when you give warnings after warnings and the other person still doesn't listen to, it's kind of normal to snap. Could you have dealt with the situation better, yes, but I still don't think your reaction makes you an AH.\n\nFinally, the therapy doesn't seem to be working. She seems to have a lot of trauma to go through.", "NTA but your family doesn\u2019t sound very loving and I hope your wife can find someone\u2019s family to accept and love her in the way she needs", "Did you ever talk to your Mom about how badly Lily wants to be a part of the family? I mean, instead of agreeing that Lily pushed too hard and needed to back off. Could you maybe ask your Mom to show her a little grace? Being called \u201cmum\u201d by your daughter in law isn\u2019t the most egregious overstepping of bounds, now is it?  Your wife IS your family. Help her integrate, rather than siding with your mom and siblings.", "ESH\n\nFrom your story, Lily is handling social interactions poorly because of her past. For the sake of this sub, she's an AH because she's been told to stop certain simple behaviors and she isn't.\n\nBut also from your story, you and your family seem awfully rigid and unforgiving. Lily called your mum \"mum\" instead of her name, which she preferred? Oh, the horror! I mean, ok, she should have stopped, but this is hardly turning up drunk to her 60th birthday and vomiting on the cake. \n\nNowhere in your post do I see any attempt or even any thought that maybe you all cut Lily some slack because she's a member of your family now and trying hard (but imperfectly) to be one. Nowhere in your post did i see any reference to how you prepared your family to meet Lily, if her norms are so different. You and your family seem to need to perhaps approach all this with some kindness and understanding and tolerance - even if Lily hadn't had her childhood, she'd have different behavioral norms that your family might not be used to. You all seem to expect that Lily should be the one doing all the compromising.", "NTA. Though I will I've heard of people calling in laws mom or dad. But this sounds like it goes beyond that. Since you've talked to her and she's in therapy, I don't know what to suggest.", "NTA but you could have handled better. I am interested to know if you explained Lilies upbringing to your family? Of course she is exuberant who wouldn\u2019t be, she wants a family so she rushed in. I think you need to have a sit down conversation with your whole family and explain her reasons for her behavior. They need to be more tolerant and Lily needs to back off as well and give them space.", "NAH - Lilly is clearly really hurting here, so I don't think I can call her TA.  She wants a family so badly.  Hopefully after your talk, she will understand that she can't force herself into this family.  Growing up in foster care, I'm sure she learned that you have to put in effort to get the love and attention that you need.  I'm not sure she learned where those boundaries are, or when it's too much effort.  She's learning some lessons now that she didn't get a chance to learn when she was younger.  I can sense the broken desperation of an unloved child.  It's hard.  She needs to back off, but she also needs to be shown some grace.  \n\nYour family are not TA for not treating her like a daughter/sister.  People get to decide how much they'd like to welcome a new in-law.  It's clear they're trying to be polite, but are also super uncomfortable with the way your wife is behaving. \n\nYou're not TA.  You're trying to keep the peace and keep everyone happy.  \n\nHopefully your wife will continue with therapy.  It sounds like she has a lot of new stuff to process.", "I'm gonna say borderline NTA, but you came really close to AH behavior. Now, maybe I have this wrong, but it reads like you keep telling her to stop, but you didn't actually have any discussions with her about it. You don't seem to have made any effort to understand why your wife keeps trying to force a relationship with your mom other than understanding she grew up without a mom.   \n\n\nAgain, I don't think you're the AH even though you snapped at her, but I think you need to have a therapy session WITH your wife where you discuss how this is affecting you as a couple. I'd be willing to bet that your wife is not actually telling her therapist about all the times she has tried to force the issue.", "NAH, but \n\n> There is a girls trip around Christmas and she wasn\u2019t invited.\n\nThat is kind of asshole-ish. I will never understand people who exclude others because they want too much to be liked.", "My mother died less than a year after my marriage. I lived in a different country and barely spoke the language. Upon returning, my MIL touched my cheek and said, \"Don't worry darling, I'm your mama now.\" \n\nKnowing your wife's background, your family seem cold and cruel. Not every family's dynamics are the same and it's a shame that this wasn't talked about before the wedding. NAH but unfortunately I'm afraid your wife will have to make some decisions if this is the family she wants to deal with for the rest of her life.", "I feel so sad for your wife. She probably feels that she is not worthy of being loved. The one hope she holds on growing up that one day she would have a family who welcome her, love her and accept her has been completely smashed. The only one that she has is you, and although I understand your point of view, she must feel so lonely and in pain right now. I fear that her mental health might decline as she hits another mile stone in this grief process.\n\nOne of the thing I noticed though is that you don't mention your family even trying to make her feel welcome. The language you are using towards your mother is nearly saintly, but the one you use towards your wife has no positives connotations. I wonder if you have even considered that your family could have been more understanding and welcoming towards your wife. To me they seem cold, but that is probably the way my brain works. Going to the relative home was probably to show support and kindness to your family, and it back fire on her. \n\nYes your wife sounds desperate to be finally accepted and loved, and that can be much to handle. I understand that this could be irritating for your family. However the way they are at the moment, making it clear to her that she will never be accepted as part of the family, is not great. \n\nI also wonder if your wife might be on the autistic spectrum or maybe having ADHD. Just a thought, which could  explain the intensity (love bombing) that can occur.\n\nI think that things could have been handled much better by all concerned. I don't think the situation is easy. \n\nI think everyone is hurt, and hopefully the therapist can help everyone move forward. NAH", "you mom and sisters sound like complete nightmares.  Your poor, poor wife is over here just desperately wanting a mom and some sisters (omg i almost cried just typing that) and her own husband wont even support her.", "Do you even like your wife?

(Yeah, really crazy, right?)\n\nHow about talking with your mom.  Yeah, Lily sounds a bit needy.  But your mom could have done a lot worse.  Lots of moms have DILs who compete with them (or who they compete with).  DILs who exclude the more than they want to be excluded.  DILs who they feel pull their sons away.  If you all keep pushing Lily to get back into  her corner you may find she opts out entirely.  How will your next wife get along with your mother?\n\nLily craves a family.  She apparently had the wild notion she was marrying into one.  Meanwhile, your mom and sisters sound like they're pretty cold things.  It doesn't sound like you're much help.", "NTA.  Your wife needs to grow up and act like an adult.", "Therapy!!!!!", "NTA, but why can\u2019t she call your mother \u201cmum?\u201d No accusations, it\u2019s just a fairly common practice in my neck of the woods.", "You should ask your wife if you can attend her therapy with her so you\u2019re not going behind her back, but also assisting her therapist understand what boundaries are being broken. You\u2019re her husband. Be her husband. You can\u2019t sit here and assume that you know what\u2019s happening. There\u2019s a reason she\u2019s trying so hard. Don\u2019t be a son, be a husband and help your wife. You sound like the AH because it sounds like you\u2019re taking your family\u2019s side and not a Lilly\u2019s. Your mother and siblings need to learn compassion. Sounds like they lack it as well.", "ESH.  It seems like everyone is just doing whatever they want, and nobody is bothering to compromise and discuss this like adults. \n\nLilly sucks for pushing too hard, especially when she was told to stop.  But, you suck also because it sounds like you KNEW Lilly going on the trip to visit the deceased relative was a bad idea, and yet you did nothing to stop it.  Or tell Lilly she shouldn't go, *and HELP her read the room - bulldozing your way into a delicate family tradition could have been 100% avoided.*   \n\nI would suggest that you meet with her therapist on your own, and explain the situation from you and your family's perspective.  Maybe her therapist can talk her through it and how to appropriately react.", "I feel like I've read this exact same AITA before", "Have you tried talking to your mother to ask why she feels this way about your wife?", "ESH. Sounds like your two should just call it quits. You can find someone who doesn't care about your own family and she can find someone who's family will welcome her. Yes, harsh and blunt but the solution IMO.", "YTA. My mom didn\u2019t have any daughters. She was so excited when I introduced my then GF. My mom likes my wife more than me. Your mom is the AH too. Your wife is part of your and your mom\u2019s family. She wants to treat her as an outsider. Your mom reminds me of another post where she wanted wife to be a server at their Christmas dinner.

They are important to me because they are important to my son.  Two of them went through divorce.  I made sure they knew our home was a safe place during their times of uncertainty.  Your family\u2019s treatment of your wife is atrocious.   If she is the one you are choosing to spend the rest of your life with, they should want to be invested in her.  When my son chooses a wife, I hope she wants to be part of our family, not just his wife.", "ESH but Lily the least. I don\u2019t care if I get downvoted but Lily needs to leave you and your family and find one that gives a fuck about her. Your family seem cold and I wouldn\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life surrounded by them. She grew up differently to you and you don\u2019t seem to have adequately prepared her for your family. How soon after meeting did you get married? How come your family didn\u2019t get a chance to bond with her? Did you put any effort into facilitating a space where the relationship can grow?

Your wife has bought in and wants to be viewed as part of the family. I understand that goes against what your mom wants, but it doesn't sound like Lily has done much other than try to get to know your mom personally, and wants to participate in family rituals. I think your family is lucky to have someone like Lily, who from your writing, is just making an effort to become a part of the family. I think you and your family need to take a second and think about what you want out of your wife. Do you want her to simply be your spouse and have your family treat her like an outsider, or do you want her to feel welcomed and involved in the family. Also calling her mother-in-law \"mum\" definitely shouldn't be considered weird or bad if she's on good terms with her. Unless Lily did something truly awful to get on the bad side of your mom, I feel the reason for their bad relationship is because you and your family have a cold outlook on family.", "Dayyyyum, so poor Lily who grew up in foster care never had a family of her own, probably feeling like a rejected outcast.  Now she has a family (or should because hello?  You're her family) and she's still being treated like a rejected outcast.  YTA.

She\u2019s never had custodial parent love and you should\u2019ve explained that to your parents as well as your siblings. It is your fault that your family hates her. She is trying her hardest to be accepted by your family, but truly she should say fuck them and fuck you. I understand that your family has boundaries, but she is looking for guidance in this life that is provided by a mother-in-law and sister-in-laws. For you to allow your mother and sisters to exclude her is disrespectful and mean as fuck. When you marry the man, you marry the family and your family is terrible. they never liked her from the beginning. It was never about her, forcing the relationship, it was about her background.

I know my wife has trouble with social interaction and they got off on a horrible start. My wife, I am going to call her Lily, was in foster care and never had a parental figure and she went hard into trying to become my mom\u2019s kid. I think it would have happened if my wife let the relationship grow naturally but she didn\u2019t take any of my warnings and bulldozed what my mom wanted.\n\nA few examples, she kept calling her \u201cmum\u201d even after she told her multiple times to call her by her name. Lily would make her uncomfortable, especially when she would ask my mom very personal question or go way too deep. I have talked to her so many times but she doesn\u2019t stop. The family has taken their concerns with me also and have straight up told her to stop.\n\nThe big turning point was when my mom and her daughters ( my sisters) went to visit deceased family member. It\u2019s a tradition between the three of them. Well Lily heard about it and went. It went very poorly and my sisters dislike Lily now also.\n\nWe are invited to events and are still in the family but the women of the family keep their distance. There is a girls trip around Christmas and she wasn\u2019t invited. This made my wife very upset and was ranting.\n\nI had enough when Lily said she was her kid. I snapped and told her my mother will never be her mom and you need to stop. She ended up crying and now I feel guilty. I just don\u2019t know how to get it through her head that she needs to stop.\n\nI\u2019ve talked with her so many times and she is already in therapy.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She needed to be told, but it sounds like a sad situation for everyone involved.

She\u2019s definitely overstepping but like idk it sounds like they could be kinder. She never had a family dude and legally like y\u2019all are family now.

Your emotional reaction to your mom but lack of emotional defense to Lily indicates to me that your mummy issues are going to destroy your connections.", "Random podunk country boy here.\n\nHonestly, Your family sounds pretty dumb. Your wife justs to feel part of something and feel like part of a family. I get it, too much too fast. However, if your family now takes the stance of not letting her in ever or not being a bit gentler I could see her leaving and I would support that. Just the way you talk about her sounds like you don't even like her...poor girl. Doesn't even seem like you're on her side.\n\nShe's not just anyone, she's your wife. That should mean something, and your family should understand she's not going anywhere anytime soon and try to get along with her and you should be helping to smooth that out. Like, what the fuck are you doing? You knew it wouldn't be a good idea for her to try and go, and you didn't try to tell her it was a bad idea. It sounds like you don't care if your family dislikes your wife, and just think she should deal with it. You're lucky she even sees your family as something to try and put effort in. If it were me I'd say fuck your family and leave you.\n\nMy advice. Either help your wife learn to navigate your family dynamics like a good spouse or let her go find people with bigger hearts.", "So you think that the children of narcs should make the effort with their parents?", "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d make that assumption. Especially since she is specifically doing things that make her in-laws uncomfortable. \n\nIf my mother-in-law was gluten-intolerant or vegetarian, and I consistently made her steak or bread pudding to show her how much I care about her, it would be absurd of me to complain that she doesn\u2019t appreciate my effort to get closer to her.\n\nWhen trying to form a close relationship with someone, it\u2019s not just about how you express love, you also have to take into consideration how they want to be loved. That\u2019s like the whole premise of love languages.", "This comment really strikes home with some of the people I see in my day to day at work. We have people that will say their therapist is telling them the things they want to hear, and I just have to wonder how honest they are being with that therapist in general. \n\nHow much of the truth are you telling, and how much of a story are you painting to get them to tell you what you want to hear? It seems to be common for people to convince themselves of these wild situations, and the therapist only has one side of a story to go on. So based on information provided, they will agree with what you are saying - but only because they don't have all of/the correct information to base a judgement on.", "This was my thought exactly as a therapist.", "It can be hard to find one that understands you, it\u2019s not necessarily to be enabled", "Many youth in foster care, here in US anyways, get therapy forced on them. Usually by people who are new to the field of therapy. They often have negative experiences with privacy being invaded between their foster homes or parents and cps workers for the state. All of these experiences add to many former foster youth not trusting therapists or having a difficult time going to therapy.", "Jesus I got fed up with you, you called someone selfish for a common boundary.\n\nMy mummy issues, seriously.\n\nYou post basically was fuck boundaries, I don\u2019t understand why Redditors don\u2019t understand what boundaries are.", "Well stated!!!", "Therapy is the \"I don't care\" response. No one actually thinks about it. How much it costs. How much times it takes and what days you might have to take off work. And most importantly who you feel comfortable with consistently to share yourself at most intimate and vulnerable.", "Whoa, this heated up quick!  You might want to ask yourself why you get so very emotional protecting your mom, but talk like you don\u2019t even like your wife. I wonder why she\u2019s feeling insecure in that family\u2026.", "We understand boundaries very deeply actually.  The thing is that you don't understand this is not about boundaries, it goes much deeper.  The boundary violation is a symptom of the root of the issue. You are looking at the surface, not the underlying cause, and accusing everyone else of standing in the shallows.  The issue is your family does not want to accept your wife and it makes you feel a certain way because you don't want to accept that reality.", "You're obviously obsessed with your mother, and it's not apparent you even like your wife...sounds like mommy issues.", "Therapy is my \u2018I care a lot but these problems are bigger than you can resolve without professional help\u2019 response. I have been in therapy for years and it is the only reason I\u2019m still alive.", "I\u2019d imagine he\u2019s getting frustrated because it\u2019s not just the calling her \u201cmum\u201d. She does other things like demand personal information, but \u201cmum\u201d has probably become the consistent flash point representative of this issue.\n\nLike, idk why Lily doesn\u2019t fathom that doing things that make people uncomfortable is not going to make them like you. That\u2019s not even specific to family. That\u2019s pretty much humans. But it seems like she expects to be given a pass because \u201cshe\u2019s family\u201d which suggests she has a deeply warped understanding of what healthy family dynamics actually are.", "Have you ever had someone get extremely clingy with you very quickly? I have, and even if I had initially liked them, the sense that someone is putting so much on you you haven't asked for or consented to can make an otherwise positive experience feel forced and emotionally violating. \n\nEg imagine you're in a mood where you're open to going swimming but haven't actually gotten to the lake yet. The next thing you know you find yourself neck deep in said lake. In a different scenario you may have been looking forward to going swimming, but being flung into the lake without warning and consent seriously strips out the fun and replaces it with a natural tendency to resist\n\nWhen someone shows me that they're repeating violating my boundaries no matter how clear I am about said boundary, I don't want to spend time with them. I'm not sure why \"your family doesn't want to accept your wife\" could be disconnected from \"your wife really made your family uncomfortable multiple times after repeat requests to stop\""]}
