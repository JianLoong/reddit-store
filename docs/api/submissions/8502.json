You have done nothing wrong. You went to support your husband, as a spouse should want to, point blank.

He can't have you, so he wants to make your life miserable, just like he's made his wife miserable. He doesn't respect her, she's probably used to affairs. Bob needs to grow up, get personal and marriage counseling, and let go. I just hope he doesn't make things worse for your husband. I used to work in HR and while at the core of it, HR is truly there to protect the business- I would recommend your husband keep notes on what goes on.

That his manager has been making inappropriate sexual comments about you. And that he is bringing it to the attention of the company to give them a chance to rectify before you report it to the authorities (police, union, industrial relations tribunal). He needs to include that he is being told that you cannot attend events where spouses are included because the manager is unable to control himself to the point where the manager's wife is angry at him.\n\nUse the words \"hostile work environment\".
