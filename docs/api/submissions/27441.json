If that's correct then NTA. He was playing around and shouldn't have been in a shopping cart in the first place. Once he got himself in that mess he should have realized that the consequences of his actions meant he would have to risk getting his shoes wet. He made the decision to sacrifice his job over his shoes.", "NTA\n\nYour employee was sitting in a shopping cart in a puddle.\n\n1. He must have been horsing around to get in that position to start with. He had no reason to be in the cart in the first place.\n2. Part of his job is working outside. Being prissy about not wanting to get his trainers wet doesn't fly. If you don't want to get your shoes wet, don't wear them to work.", "NTA. It sounds like this kid just doesn't want to work, and now he doesn't have to. Everyone wins.", "NTA these Y T A judgements are laughable. Guy screwed around instead of working, somehow got himself trapped in a puddle and then refused to do his job. If you hadn't fired him then, I'm sure it would have happened shortly thereafter over some other nonsense.", "NTA. Hes being absurd. He wore new trainers to work in the rain.", "NTA\n\nCommon sense isn't. \n\nIf you get stuck in a situation like that, take your shoes & socks off, roll your pant legs up and walk your happy butt through the puddle.  \n\nDry your feet and legs and put your shoes and socks back on and roll your pant legs back down again.\n\nThis kid was just too dumb to keep the job.", "NTA. Kids probably never been told *no* once in his life and needs to learn eventually that not everyone is like his mommy and daddy and is going to baby him. He was gifting around, got himself in the situation, and refused to do the big boy thing and get back to work. Thank you for doing society a favor.\n\nSomeone might say you could have thrown him a rope, and then pulled the cart to a dry place. Nope. You do that, the cart flips over, he tells mommy what you did to her baby and you and your employer are getting sued.", "NTA I wouldn't have even given him a choice. I would have have sacked him on the spot. You were kind enough to give him an out.", "NTA\n\nwtf was an adult doing in a shopping cart in the first place?", "He chose dry shoes over his job.\n\nThat being said I wouldn't want to work all day on wet shoes either, he should have been smart enough to avoid the puddle (or if your parking lot is always awful buy some goloshes).", "\"Hey, could you pass me that two-by-four so I can climb out of this puddle?\"\n\n\"No way. Get wet or get fired.\"\n\nI mean, this story doesn't make you sound great.", "That was singularly the most British thing I have ever read. I'm disappointed you weren't able to fit the word \"whilst\" in there, but still, that was very British. And ESH. Him for putting himself in a shopping cart and rolling into a lake, you for immediately firing him because you were in a bad mood. There's no mention of whether him being a terrible employee was a habit, if it was and this was just a last straw sort of thing, I would probably change my vote.", "ESH.   \nYou sacked a kid\u2026 who is stupid and clearly has some impulse issues\u2026 but by your own admission is young. You don\u2019t say there were other issues with this kid, so if this sacking is out of the blue with no pre warning or prior behaviour issues\u2026 then you kinda suck because this is the sort of impulse shit young adults screw up on - mentoring them through it is better. If the puddle is deep enough that it\u2019s going to soak through his shoes and leave him in soggy socks for the next few hours that\u2019s not good for his skin health on his feet - and probably going to leave marks on your shop floor.  Is it possible he can only afford a new pair of shoes occasionally? \n\nHe sucks\u2026 for obvious reasons.", "Yta and a terrible boss", "YTA you would rather fire someone than help them avoid getting wet.  hope the extra time and money spent searching for and training someone new was worth it.", "Was the puddle so deep your socks would have got wet? Would you have walked into it? If yes then, YTA. No one wants to walk around with wet feet all day. It's bad for you.", "YTA. Don't talk shit twice. Did that just go out?
