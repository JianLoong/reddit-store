And you shouldn\u2019t have felt the need to compensate him financially if he had taken over the housework while you were too unwell to do it. People have different financial agreements in marriages, but people also pick up the slack for their S/O\u2019s in situations like pregnancy when it becomes hard to put in 50/50. I understand him feeling uncomfortable with someone else cleaning up his mess- but if he wouldn\u2019t do it, and you\u2019ve expressed not feeling able to, the only answer is someone else coming in to help. Good job for getting the help you needed, and I hope your husband comes around and realizes how unfair it is to expect you to continue living in a dirty space due to his own discomfort and unfulfilled promises.", "NTA - At first I was thinking that this can be smoothed over with some honest communication with each other, and thought there was enough reason for you to apologize, but after the way he reacted I'm actually worried for you.  More than a little.  I'm seeing red flags here.  Men who worry about their privacy like that and blow up over it enough to storm out for hours usually turn out to be very controlling, narcissistic, and dangerous. \n\nBe safe..", "NTA. You told him that if he didn\u2019t clean it, you\u2019d call someone to do it so he really can\u2019t be upset that you followed through.", "NTA your husband has issues and sounds like a lazy inconsiderate slob. You're pregnant, he shouldn't be losing his shit at you even if he felt so adamant against having a \"stranger\" into your home. Its a little weird he would even accept money from a pregnant wife for doing his fare share of chores while you carry human life inside you.", "Nta your husband is an ass", "NTA and if he were so worried about his \"privacy\" he could have made the time to do the cleaning he offered. And don't you dare pay him to do your share of cleaning unless he pays you to do his share of gestating his baby.", "NTA. I'm also pregnant right now, congrats btw, and have been dealing with a similar thing. Basically been too tired to clean. I still work FT as well so really have nothing in the tank when I get home and mostly use the weekend to recoup. I'm hoping as I enter second trimester it will get better. Anyway, we have 3 kids already so the house takes about an hour to become a mess again. My husband has picked up so much of my slack, which I am so grateful for. I would love to be able to hire someone to help clean, but we can't afford that right now. \n\nLong story short, NTA and it sounds like your husband might have some issues around cleaning. \n\nKC Davis on strugglecare has some good resources for people who struggle with cleaning or basic self care. Might not be helpful, might be, so figured I'd mention.", "NTA.  He should not be treating you so poorly.  Is he always like this or is it just this one issue?", "NTA. He hadn\u2019t done the cleaning so you had it taken care of. If the smell was making you sick, it needed to be taken care of sooner than later", "NTA.\n\nThe good news is, he's young... time to nip that controlling bunch of crap in the bud.\n\nI'm a little concerned about why he's so concerned about \"privacy.\"  Is there something in the house there shouldn't be?  Not even necessarily something bad, just something he doesn't think he wants someone seeing?  (innocent \"herbs,\" naughty toys...like that?).\n\nIf so, you all need to talk it over and find some places that are \"no-go zones\" that he can put stuff he doesn't want looked at.\n\nThere is absolutely no shame in getting help.  He needs to cowboy up and get over it.  \n\n\nEDIT: Ah I totally missed the part about him being embarrassed about the state of the house.  Okay then, the time to have gotten help is before it got to that point.  That said, he needs to get over feeling guilty.  Again, there's absolutely nothing wrong with not being able to \"do it all.\"  \n\nThat's a yuppie thing that needs to die, HARD.", "NTA at all. He said he would do it, he didn\u2019t, so you got it done. I am so, so sorry for you that he sounds like he\u2019s going to be a terrible father. If he doesn\u2019t want people knowing he\u2019s lazy, messy, and dirty then he needs to not be lazy, messy, and dirty", "NTA. You can't be expected to live in filth, especially when pregnant. I also think it's ridiculous you would have to pay him to pick up the slack you can't do currently because you're busy growing HIS child.", "NTA and you were seriously considering to pay for the cleaning? You're creating and carrying a whole life in your womb, half his DNA, changing your body forever, and then you have to PAY??\n\nDude.", "NTA mostly but some people are weird about having other people clean their stuff. Seems your husband is one. \n\nYou did what needed to be done because your husband didn\u2019t but going forward you should be more clear. If this isn\u2019t done by such and such a time I\u2019m brining in a cleaner. \n\nThat said, marriage doesn\u2019t work 50/50 so why you offered to pay your husband to clean is beyond me.\n\nSometimes you do more, sometime he\u2019ll do more. It will ebb and flow. A marriage that insists that everything be 50/50 won\u2019t survive especially after a child enters the picture.\n\nThat said, growing a human is hard. It sucks your energy, your vitamins, your oxygen. You do not need to apologize for being exhausted. It\u2019s normal and your husband needs to picking up the slack without complaint or brining in a cleaner himself. \n\nWhen the baby is born it\u2019s pretty likely you\u2019ll still be exhausted, but like most mothers you\u2019ll just adapt to functioning on less sleep, food, energy ect and will be handling more of the load (including child load) than he will.\n\nDiscuss this with your husband, so you both aware that at times one of you will be doing more heavy lifting than the other.", "NTA - you\u2019re pregnant & he\u2019s not prepared to take on a little extra cleaning, but won\u2019t agree to someone else doing it! What happens when the baby arrives?", "\u201cFair\u201d is such an odd concept here. Feeding the cat and doing the laundry is MUCH easier than planning, shopping, making dinner and cleaning up afterwards. \n\nIt seems to me like his half should include cleaning the house. \n\nOr, swap chores for awhile and let him do everything concerning food and you can do the cleaning and laundry.", "NTA - some moderate red flags there.", "Nta", "THIS YOUR DAILY REMINDER TO NOT GET MARRIED IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COMBINE FINANCES.

This is not how relationships should work.", "NTA your husband is", "Red flags!\nYou're pregnant and understandably exhausted. And this is clearly a tough pregnancy if you're losing weight.\nFrankly, your husband sounds abusive and abusers are known to escalate during pregnancy.\nHe might be the perfevt guy but I hope you'll educate yourself on what emotional abuse looks like.", "It is ver bad for you to loose weight while pregnant.  You need to eat regular healthy meals.  If he is stopping you from doing it go stay somewhere you can get the proper care.", "NTA and you offered to pay him and he accepted. That\u2019s unbelievable!  Does he have any idea what it\u2019s going to be like when you have a baby?", "OP, it's outrageous that you would expect to pay your husband for keeping the house minimally clean. You are growing HIS CHILD inside your body, and you are doing it for the benefit of both of you. Suggest to him that it would only be fair for you to pay him for housework if he pays you a typical surrogacy fee.\n\nI'm not saying you should milk it to get out of doing things you absolutely can do, but I am saying YOU are the one experiencing fatigue and other symptoms and risking your life and health for this joint endeavor. He needs to contribute other ways by either cleaning without complaint or paying for housecleaning himself.", "NTA. I would suggest asking him how he sees the division of labor going once the baby is actually born. If this extra cleaning was already too much for him he needs to figure out how he's going to deal with it. He needs to understand after your birth a baby your body needs rest for the sake of you and baby! So he'll have to help and it can't be on a lackadaisical schedule. A newborn can't be waiting a week for dirty bottles and dusty floors to finally be addressed. NTA, be sure he comes with to your next appointment so he can hear directly from your doctor what stress does to a pregnant woman and the inherent dangers it has for baby. I hope he quits being a jerk to you and takes his fatherhood role more seriously going forward.", "It is weird that you want and try to be fair, share the chores, etc., but what you got is a dysfunctional marriage.

He needs to clean, period. You should have given him a heads up that if the house wasn't clean by Sunday, you were having someone come by on Monday, period. He also needs to get some more therapy, but that's not going to work overnight.", "NTA, but I really think you need to find out what he's hiding, before you give birth, so you can still escape if you need to.", "NTA NTA NTA!  If he\u2019s too embarrassed for a housekeeper to see how dirty your place is - then he can clean it.  I\u2019ve had a housekeeper since we bought our house. I started because I had an hour commute.  I kept it because I earn as much as my husband and I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s my job do the cleaning. I\u2019ve made financial sacrifices to pay for the housekeeper - like cutting out cable TV, because having a cleaner is a priority. I\u2019ve offered to hire a lawn service but he likes to cut the grass. There\u2019s no shame in getting help.  My position is that its my job to make sure the house gets clean. That doesn\u2019t mean you or I am obligated to actually do the cleaning.", "ESH\n\nYour husband needs to work on his hairpin temper - BUT he *was* very clear with you that he didn't want an outsider coming in to clean the home and you said \"Fuck what you want\" and did it anyway.    Living in a dirty house sucks, but from the sounds of it, he isn't the only one who lives there which means that you are also contributing to the dirtiness/smelliness of said house.   He works outside of the home, and yet you expect him to come home from a full day of work and immediately turn into Cinderella.", "She's growing HIS CHILD - that is work and she's doing it for the benefit of both of them. This does not even count as slack or people needing help sometimes like others are saying. Not to pick on you but I feel this isn't getting nearly enough attention.", "Commenting again to add- people need help sometimes, life gets overwhelming. I know my mom struggled a lot when she was pregnant with me/first had me and the house was atrocious. It got to the point where she put up a sheet between the living room and kitchen because the living room was the only space she could keep sanitary and there were loads of fruit flies elsewhere. You are not lazy, messy, or dirty- and that\u2019s hardly ever the case. Pregnancy is hard, babies are hard. Be kind to yourself and let your husband know that it\u2019s very normal in these situations to need loads of outside help. \u201cIt takes a village\u201d applies even before the child is born.", "NTA. \ud83d\udea9\nThis too caught my eye but my mind went to illicit activity that he's hiding-- so he didn't want strangers in the house.", "I honestly don't understand this. OP's husband has a pregnant wife who isn't eating due to the condition of their home. As a *husband who supposedly loves his wife*, that should be reason enough to clean. It takes maybe a couple hours to make someone he loves happy. Why wouldn't he do it?\n\n\nBut no, he doesn't. So OP asks if a friend can help clean. Because she's losing weight and the house stinks. And instead of swallowing his pride and saying yes to help the wife *he supposedly loves*, he doubles down and ignores everything.\n\n\nI'm teased all the time for being a neat freak, although I don't think I am. But I don't function well with mess or clutter and was taught to clean from my Italian grandma who should own stock in bleach cleaning products. If my husband was like this, I'd straight up rethink the marriage. Cleaning isn't hard. It doesn't take a ton of time when done properly and consistently. The fact he can't do a couple simple things to make his wife happy then goes above and beyond by being mad when she hires the work out is concerning.\n\nNTA, OP. But you might want to iron out what it's going to be like after the baby comes. Because if he's this pissed over someone cleaning now after he dropped the ball for months, he's going to be in for a rude awakening when the baby comes home.", "He was waiting for her to do it. He was never going to. Probably figured she would get tired of nagging him and do it herself. He was happy to see it clean until she said she paid someone.", "I want to know what he's worried the cleaning lady would find.", "That really does not matter. Absolute exhaustion can hit you like a hammer as early as 6 weeks. Along with vomiting, omg. OP says she has lost 5 pounds so not being able to eat due to nausea or smell aversion is draining her energy as well. Plus, she is working full time. Early pregnancy with my daughter, for like the first 5 months I ended up taking 9.5 weeks off total (due to vomiting but I was never diagnosed with HG) So yeah... also with my son now I have had SPD since 4 months pregnant and walking is absolute agony. I have not been able to clean much since then. Not at all for the past 3 months. I literally cannot walk 2 feet without agonizing pain and having to sit and have not been able to for months.", "I presume early because that's when the worst exhaustion kicks in.  It does tend to pass.", "I'm 4 and a half months pregnant, the 5 pounds it's just what I've lost in the last 3 weeks, in the first 2 months I lost other 9 pounds, I might have HG and I take suplements but I still feel very exhausted and I'm only able to hold down some fruits like bananas and watermelon wich is not much", "He AGREED to clean the house. And not even for free! When it is his own house and his gf that he got pregnant! Then he did nothing! And he obviously knew it was disgusting because he was mad because the woman saw how dirty and disgusting it was.", "As someone with a blue collar job it sucks to come home and do chores but like its been 3 weeks he has had days off to do it for sure. He had his chances and didnt do it. Time to get it done", "Oh no! She is absolutely NTA. The husband should br cleaning and caring for his pregnant wife while she's ill. Instead he's blowing up, ignoring her needs, and is controlling her ability to get help. He shouldn't get need to be paid either.", "No I fully agree with you, I just meant in the sense that she can\u2019t currently keep up with her own designated housework as they typically split it evenly- picking up the slack may not have been the best way to describe it.", "I don\u2019t think you meant to reply to me.", "This!", "His secret sex toys?", "Maybe they wanted to know how many months to know how serious it was to lose 5 pounds during that time of pregnancy, not to excuse his behavior. At least thats what I took it as", "Just adding onto your comment. Not saying you specifically. Agreeing with you. Sorry that wasn't clear.", "Oh, got ya!
