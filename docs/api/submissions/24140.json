My husband is on board with this idea, believing it would contribute positively to the boy's personal growth.\n\nI expressed to my husband that I have reservations about having him live with us, based on observations during the weekends he spends at our place:\n\nFirstly, he appears to have a strained relationship with my younger son. He rarely includes him in activities unless I specifically prompt him to do so. When I ask him to assist the younger boy, such as accompanying him to the bathroom, he does so with obvious reluctance.\n\nSecondly, he displays an excessive competitive streak towards my older son. He consistently aims to outperform him and even taunts him when he succeeds. I find this overly competitive atmosphere uncomfortable. I desire my children to grow up in a nurturing and supportive environment.\n\nThe third and most significant concern is his academic and behavioral performance. My boyfriend has informed me that his son has been struggling academically and has faced minor behavioral challenges. I am concerned about his potential negative influence on my children, particularly my older son.\n\nMy husband dismisses these concerns as typical for his age, believing that with our guidance, he could improve. I sought advice from my mother, and she disagrees with me, asserting that providing a united family environment could greatly benefit my stepson. Both of them label my reasons as unreasonable.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Many people didn't quite catch the bathroom example I provided. Let's say we're at a park, I can't let my 5-year-old go to the bathroom alone. So, I might have my stepson accompany him for safety reasons. It's the kind of thing an older child should do for a younger one.\n\nUpdate: I know that I am not the best person, but I never mistreated or ignored my future stepson. I care for him, and I would never think of hurting him. I realize now that I was being overly protective of my own children and not considering things from my future stepson's perspective.  I was afraid that my future stepson might bully my kids (for example, excluding the younger one from activities he enjoys, like building with Legos, or teasing the older one when he wins), but now I can see that if he wants to live with us, it's because he cares about his future siblings.  \nMoreover, as a responsible adult, I understand that I have an obligation to help him with behavior and school grades.  \nI talked to my boyfriend, and I accept that he can come live with us. Now, we'll need to move to a new house so that each child can have their own room, and we'll have to work on getting custody.", "created_utc": 1691459354, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15l42nk/aita_for_not_allowing_my_stepson_12m_to_live_with/", "score": 8978, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And lastly, a lot of kids that age go through some academic and minor behavioral struggles. Your own kids will as well. \n\nI will say that if you continue this your partner should refuse to marry you and should end the relationship.

Would it be a deal breaker? Would you consider it? Remember it's what you're asking from him.\n\nYou sound like you're digging up reasons and even what you're scraping up isnt alarming behavior. Most 12 year old boys aren't interested in playing with 5 year olds, even biological brothers. But him living there would give them all the opportunity to grow as siblings. And of course he isn't excited to be asked to chaperone a child to the bathroom- is your 10 year old?\n\nOverall it seems very selfish and like you want your idea of the perfect family, which doesn't include stepson.

You are marrying this man, this son comes as a package deal. \n\n1. He is a teenager, not a nanny. It's normal he doesn't want to wipe your kid's butt.\n2.

Maybe if your stepson moves in, he just might grow closer to your younger son over time. Regardless, you can't force it. As for being competitive with your oldest, some kids are competitive by nature. Depending on the circumstances, the best thing to do is to try to discourage it. As for the behavior and grades, being in a steady home environment could very well help with that. With grades, you and your husband need to be willing to have contact with his teachers if he's struggling to find out what can be done to help.", "YTA. This is an opportunity to talk to him about how he treats your bio children. He's a kid who probably always has to be the best at everything to feel loved, and you can help him grow. \n\nMost kids aren't ecstatic to supervise a 5yo in the restroom.

Nothing you\u2019ve said is anything past kids learning how to play nicely with others.", "YTA. He sounds like a normal teenager.

He has no frame of reference and very little in common. Also, it's YOUR job to take your 5 year old to the bathroom...it's awkward to take a younger kid you barely know to the restroom.

When I ask him to assist the younger boy, such as accompanying him to the bathroom, he does so with obvious reluctance.  \n\n\n  \nSecondly, he displays an excessive competitive streak towards my older son. He consistently aims to outperform him and even taunts him when he succeeds. I find this overly competitive atmosphere uncomfortable. I desire my children to grow up in a nurturing and supportive environment.  \n\n\n  \nThe third and most significant concern is his academic and behavioral performance. My boyfriend has informed me that his son has been struggling academically and has faced minor behavioral challenges. I am concerned about his potential negative influence on my children, particularly my older son.  \n\n\n  \nMy husband dismisses these concerns as typical for his age, believing that with our guidance, he could improve.

He consistently aims to outperform him and even taunts him when he succeeds.\n\nThis is what siblings (especially if they are close in age) do!

He is at the age where school is starting to get more difficult, he will have more homework, more tests, new/more subjects, so obviously he may struggle more. Living in a home with more support with parents who prioritize education will help him grow and develop better study habits.   This is where it could be more likely that your son will be able to be a good influence on your step-son rather than the other way around because you will be there with them on a daily basis to support and encourage good study habits.     \n\nAs far as the \"minor behavioral challenges\" go, that is also very normal for a 12 year old.  He is going through puberty.  He's got crazy hormones running rampant through his body right now, changing his body, brain, emotions, everything!  This is a pivotal time in his life, and he needs and deserves a stable loving family and home to teach, guide, and model good healthy relationships,  life skills, and habits. \n\nPlease reconsider your stance on this.    \nYour step-son is just as important and deserving as your bio-sons.

How about at your house \u2014 or is he too busy with the 5 year old to study?\n\nParenting is not easy, and there\u2019s always, always, always more work to do.
