Maybe if your stepson moves in, he just might grow closer to your younger son over time. Regardless, you can't force it. As for being competitive with your oldest, some kids are competitive by nature. Depending on the circumstances, the best thing to do is to try to discourage it.

Have you not seen any of the hundreds of videos of child abductions caught on tape? I'm assuming at 5 years old you mean that you don't want him wandering off to be kidnapped? So you put another child in charge? Kidnappers have been known to snatch the child right out of the arms of the mother's but a 12 year old should be responsible? If you let two kids wander off at a water park and anything happens that would be you're fault. They don't even know each other that well but you don't tell your bio son to take his little brother? The younger child was probably uncomfortable too but he had no choice. You're upset that a child who is almost a teen doesn't want to always play with a child who is almost still a toddler? He can't use the bathroom alone but you expect the other kids to constantly keep him entertained? Sounds like you want to pawn the toddler off on the kids and keep having problems with that. I feel bad for the stepson for hoping to have a good family and he got an evil stepmother. Did you ever think that a good family life may impact him positively? No you didn't.

When I ask him to assist the younger boy, such as accompanying him to the bathroom, he does so with obvious reluctance.  \n\n\n  \nSecondly, he displays an excessive competitive streak towards my older son. He consistently aims to outperform him and even taunts him when he succeeds. I find this overly competitive atmosphere uncomfortable. I desire my children to grow up in a nurturing and supportive environment.  \n\n\n  \nThe third and most significant concern is his academic and behavioral performance. My boyfriend has informed me that his son has been struggling academically and has faced minor behavioral challenges. I am concerned about his potential negative influence on my children, particularly my older son.  \n\n\n  \nMy husband dismisses these concerns as typical for his age, believing that with our guidance, he could improve.

I know that I can't control outside, but in my house I should control.", "He\u2019s asking for the stability and love of a family environment- which I think is pretty incredible. I would guess that this kid is actually pretty empathetic and introspective.", "Yes OP should take her own son or have his 10yr old brother take him.  He has mastered toileting by now and could help his younger brother.\n\nFunny how she doesnt want stepson around unless he is performing a service for her.", "Yeah same, I have boys and I\u2019ve always taken them in with me and nobody has ever batted an eye.  It\u2019s weird to act helpless about this.", "And you couldn\u2019t take him why?", "So a 12 year old is reluctant to hang out with a 5 year old and you see this as an issue?\n\nIt\u2019s normal \n\nAlso you take your own kid to the loo! \n\nIt\u2019s your kid\n\nEdit - so ONE EXAMPLE of the 12 year old being \u201creluctant\u201d is now HE HAS A PROPENSITY TO NOT WANT TO BE WITH HIS BROTHER!

It will also be his father\u2019s house.", "School is very important to me in general. I work in education and guess what age I work with? The behaviors are TYPICAL. It is normal for them to not have themselves together every minute of the school day and to struggle academically. 99% of the time it works itself out by the end of middle school. The only kids who continue to have behavioral problems are those who are displaying major behaviors. The rest get in some minor scrapes and then they learn how to control their thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Academically they figure out the new workload and how to handle their new learning. \n\nYou are making a mountain out of several molehills.", "So you set expectations for him when he comes to live with you full time.

Maybe they're the bad influences and your just to blind to see it.", "It isn't just your house", "'typical' doesn't mean the behaviour is good or even acceptable - typical means that a 12 year old acting out a little after huge personal life changes is completely normal and, while it of course has to be corrected, nothing to be concerned about\n\nyou're acting like this kid's a potential school shooter because he's having a few age and situation appropriate issues at school", "And yet he *doesn\u2019t even refuse*, regardless of how \u201cobviously reluctant\u201d he may look.", "You sound controlling enough as it is, you need to ease back.

If you don\u2019t like that child/don\u2019t want him around your children, you should not be marrying him. Would you marry someone who didn\u2019t want your boys around? The boy deserves to be able to live with his father if he wants to just like yours live with you. What if your fianc\u00e9 told you he only wanted your boys to be allowed to \u2018visit\u2019 on weekends? You\u2019d walk right?
