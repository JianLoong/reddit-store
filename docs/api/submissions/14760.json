My mom was over the moon happy about it. My brothers and I looked at each other when she said it but said nothing right away. My sister said I was quiet about it and she didn't think \"the boys\" aka our brothers, would get it but she thought her only sister would. I told her I did get it but she should probably know that grandma hated her name Josephine and she wanted people to call her Rosie. My sister was shocked and asked why she never knew and I told her it was because grandma was sick by the time she was old enough to really remember her. My sister said everyone else called her Josephine. I told her most people did and she hated it.\n\nGrandma was Josephine Rose. Grandma hated her first name and the nicknames people called her (Jojo, Jo, Josie). She went by Rosie with friends and my grandpa called her Rosie. But her parents and her only sister told her she was silly for hating her name and called her Josephine her whole life. My mom and her siblings ended up ignoring what grandma and grandpa told them about grandma hating her name and would always say they were \"Josephine's kids\" and not Rosie's. Grandma was really bothered by it so my brothers and I would call her Granny Rosie when we were around her, so someone in her life would call her what she preferred. She was so happy and when she died, my mom and her siblings insisted she would be called Josephine in the obituary and never mentioned Rosie in it at all. My sister was too young to really remember the whole discussion and she wasn't even born when we started calling grandma Granny Rosie.\n\nAfter I told my sister she wanted to think some. She asked our brothers and I a few days later if grandma would have liked the honor name thing. My oldest brother said she wouldn't have seen her using the name Josephine as  an honor for her and likely would have said she just liked the name. She was like okay, went to speak to our parents.\n\nAll hell broke loose and my parents were asking how we could lie and disrespect grandma like that. My sister then said we just didn't like the name and it was terrible for me to lie about her disliking Josephine and going by Rosie when she could never name her daughter Rosie. My brother kept letters our grandparents wrote to each other. Each and every letter grandma was Rosie. She also wrote Rosie on IDs she had when she volunteered. \n\nMy sister conceded that it was true but said I still shouldn't have told her and only did it to discourage her from using the name.

I'm surprised by your parents.", "NTA. You're expressing the truth you and your brothers grew up with, and the letters back you up. Some serious side-eye for your mom on not respecting what grandma wanted to be called, though.", "Your sister is so lame. If she liked the name so much, she didnt need to use honoring your grandma as a reason.\n\nAlso, Rosie is such a cute name!", "I have to say NTA. It wasn't done maliciously; you were telling her the truth. You even have the proof of it. But people are going to remember others through their own memories. I doubt she'll change her mind.", "NTA, 1000%. Your grandmother chose her name. It was different from her given name, but no less her name. It was entirely disrespectful for your mother to refuse to respect her mother\u2019s wishes. It was fair for you to say something.", "NTA. You didn't say anything until asked and then told the truth. It sounds like really honouring your grandmother would be to follow her wishes on what her name was to her", "NTA\n\nIt's not really honouring someone's memory and presence if it goes against what that person themselves preferred. Your sister having such an emotional reaction to this new information is on her, and what she does from here is also on her.\n\nThere is no way you are a bad person for offering relevant information about a situation concerning the memory of a loved family member.", "NTA\nYou're trying to be helpful.\nI hope the compromise can be reached for her to be called Rosie which probably won't happen as your mom seems very anti it.", "NTA: Yes you did it to discourage her from using a name to \"honour\" the grandmother who hated the name. Which therefore wouldn't \"honour\" her.   \n\n\nNow if she loves the name and still wants to use it that's her business. She's entitled to do so, just don't claim it's \"honouring\" your grandmother.  \n\n\nThe only asshole here is your Mum.", "NTA\n\nBut I'm so angry for your grandma because she didn't deserve that disrespect from her family. Calling someone the name they are okay with being called is such a basic level of respect. \n\nYou and your brothers were awesome and really honored your Grandma Rosie.", "NTA. Your family dynamic sounds exhausting. And now you know your sister prefers you lie to her, but I bet she won\u2019t tell you which things to lie about, so for the rest of your life you will have this voice in the back of your head every time you interact with your sister, asking \u201cshould I tell the truth?\u201d I recommend naming that voice Josephine, to honor your grandmother.", "Reading this hurts my head. Look it was just fine to be honest about your grandma not liking her name. All you need to say to your sister \u201c definitely call you baby Josephine or whatever you want! I\u2019ll be happy for you!\u201d But the name wasn\u2019t will not be honoring her\u201d. Everyone can be mad if they choose and be done with it. Being mad at this is ridiculous. NTA", "NAH. \n\nSo fun personal fact: my Gramma A was just like yours'. She had a name her mother loved but she hated, so she went by the overtly feminine version of it instead. And then when I was little, everyone told me to call her \"Mimi Mel\" (after her middle name). Turn out she fuckin' HATED being called Mimi Mel, and FINALLY told me when I was, like, nine. It took me a few months, but after that she was the name SHE chose- Gramma A. \n\nIf your sister names her daughter Josephine, she's going to be honoring your great grandparents, not your grandma Rosie. And that's fine! It's perfectly okay of your sister loves a name that your great grandma loved; a bond between multiple generations that never got to meet. But your sister deserves to know WHO she's honoring when she names her baby. \n\nMaybe sit down with your sister and make sure she knows there's nothing wrong with her name choice, just that she's honoring a different ancestor then she intended.", "You're NTA. It's not as if you were trying to discourage your sister from using the name because you don't like it. If it's just about honoring Grandma, she should think again about Rose or some variation of it. If she really likes the name Josephine, she should use it, but it wouldn't be doing much to honor Grandma.\n\n>My sister conceded that it was true but said I still shouldn't have told her and only did it to discourage her from using the name. \n\nShe should be glad it didn't come out after the baby was born.", "NTA - after seeing the letters and so on it\u2019s unbelievable your sister would make that kind of accusation. You tried to help her honour your grandma by correcting a misconception of your sister\u2019s that really is only the result of her youth. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong.", "NTA the baby should be named Rose if she wants to honor the grandmother. If she doesn't, she can name it whatever she pleases. Bigger issue: the grandparents seem to have lost their minds.", "NTA at all! It\u2019s pretty typical for older generations to go by their middle names. We found out after the deaths of both my grandmothers that their names, were in fact, their middle names and what we thought were their middle, were their first. Honestly, if she wants to honor her memory she should go with what your grandmother preferred", "Honestly, I find it incredibly bizarre that your family is so insistent on calling your grandma Josephine. Like...why? Do they hate her or something?\n\nNTA but I don't think your sister's in the wrong for wanting to use the name Josephine, if that's how she remembers grandma. Because let's face it, naming a kid after a relative who's passed is more for the parents than for the relative.\n\nBut you're definitely not the asshole for letting her know about the name. Your family's reaction was way over the top and they're being completely disrespectful for insisting on using a name your grandma hated.", "NTA. Duh.\n\n\nAlso, Rosie is a beautiful name. My great-grandma, who I was really close to, was called Rosalia, so maybe I'm biased, but still.", "I am so confused ... why is everyone mad??\n\nShe can still name her daughter Josephine.

Wtf is that behaviour.", "But that\u2019s the thing it\u2019s all just on paper. If sister likes the name she can name her daughter Josephine & the family can call her whatever they want.

She no longer has a strong opinion on the name josephine. When we honor the dead we are actually honoring the living, those who loved that person.

Your parents are behaving oddly, to say the least. It's so sad to me that this woman made it to the end of her life and her children refused to acknowledge her preference for her own name.

Rose is a perfectly acceptable name. It doesn't have to officially be \"Rosie.\" It can still be Josephine. Just because her grandmother did not like the name doesn't mean her child will. It just doesn't follow as much as the deceased grandmother probably would have liked if she was strictly doing it to honor her with her grandmother's approval if she was still able to get it.", "NTA. My grandmother also hated her first name and used her middle name or the nickname that went with it.

We named my daughter after my husband's grandmother (who is still living). She lives in a different state that us and before our daughter was born I had never met her and heard her on the phone only once. \n\nGrandma has a unique name and was named after her father. Think \"Tommie\" named after a Thomas (not the actual names), most people assume it is a nick name and not a full name. We kept the name a surprise. Turns out grandma strongly disliked her name and always went by a nickname that started with the same letter. We had no clue. \n\nWe drove LO to meet Grandma and grandma asked if we were sure we wanted that to be her name. We told her we did and that it fit her well. Our daughter was 7 months by this time. She warmed up to it. The family loved that she was named after grandma.", "Or they  name the baby Rosie. Problem solved. Baby is named after grandma.", "NTA i don't get how these people ignored her wished for decades?", "NTA by far! My grandma was the same way.

Is pregnant sister the golden child?", "NTA your parents are weird.\n\nBut you should also help your sister to realize that naming her daughter Josephine and honoring your grandmother are not mutually exclusive. The only person who has to like the name Josephine in the long run is your future niece. If your sister accepts what happened to your grandmother and allows her own daughter to like or dislike the name Josephine on her own terms, your grandmother would be wonderfully honored.", "NTA. You are in a very lose/lose situation here. Had you not told your sister and she found out your grandmother hated her name years down the road you would have been a fault for not telling her earlier.

She said no! I bet that grandma would have said no too.", "NTA.", "NTA\nYou told her the truth about your grandmother's preferences.  She can do what she wants with it after that. Naming kids after people is kind of iffy anyway IMO as you don't know that the child will love the name of someone who died long before they were born. It is a bit different if they can get to know the person a bit.\n\nMy grandmother also hated her legal first name (Hazel) and went by her middle name. I did not know until I got a bit older because everyone used her preferred name. Her legal first name was included in her obituary and on her gravestone. My mom just told me that grandma hated her first name and she did not know why. I think Hazel is a fine name but if I were going to name my child after her to honor her then it would be the name she actually used and liked. My spouse was strongly against naming our child after anyone so we did not use any family names.", "I hated my birth name and changed it when I was a teenager. My friends have always called me by my preferred name, and it's the only name I've been known by in adulthood. My family, however, have never been happy with my decision and never respected it. It's actually part of an avalanche of reasons that I chose to become estranged from them over.\n\nIf one of my children wanted to call their child my birth name, I'd respect their right to call a kid whatever they wanted, but it wouldn't be an honour, I wouldn't feel complimented, and it would be a constant reminder of something and some people I hate.

Good work standing up for who she was and not who others insist on imagining she was.", "NTA at all. If your sister is really trying to honor her grandmother, she should name the kid Rose. It\u2019s baffling that your family could be so disrespectful to your grandmother and then continue to be so posthumously in the name of love.", "NTA - My god the amount of \"naming\" posts that are on this subreddit is *insane*. My sister was named after a great-grandmother that we never knew, and that horrific name was GLADYS. I'll never understand why, since my parents never intended on calling her that. My sister has hated this name her entire life and goes by her middle name. All to be named after someone that's a ghost we never knew. This is such an old-fashioned tradition that is just really outdated and unnecessary, and frankly sometimes a little bit odd. As someone who has countless \"Williams\" in our family since we're really boring...who is this practice for? Why is this tradition worth so much to so many that they're willing to fracture an entire family over these nonsensical arguments?", ">when she could never name her daughter Rosie.\n\nWhy not?", "NAH. Josephine is the name your sister likes. It also is legally her grandmas name and the name your sister associates with her grandma. Grandma is not around to feel one way or the other about it. You weren\u2019t in the wrong for telling her, i think it\u2019s pretty relevant information to have. Beyond that, I\u2019m not sure why everyone\u2019s make such a fuss out of this\u2026", "NTA at all\u2026 it\u2019s wild you\u2019re even wondering if YTA, you\u2019ve just shared the truth about your grandmas view on her name. I can\u2019t believe everyone would disrespect your grandmas choice like this. \n\nYour sister is being strange, if she\u2019s that determined to use it then she should. But why should you pretend your grandma liked it and would like it", "Your sister can honor grandma with a similar name. And she will always know her special namesake. Our cousin named their daughter Josette, Josie for short.", "That\u2019s a good way of putting it.", "This is the way", "All my grandparents kids were the same. All of them said grandma was Josephine and never used Rosie. Don't know why they were dicks like that but alas, it happened.", "I wish my grandma's kids had used the name she preferred like she wanted in the obituary and on her headstone. But they only used Josephine.", "My grandmother was born Alice Margaret and died just Margaret. She \\*hated\\* Alice, refused to use it anywhere for anything, and managed to shed it so completely it was never mentioned on her death certificate. We grew up hearing stories about her being spanked in school for refusing to 'answer to her own name'. She would probably come back and haunt someone if they tried to use Alice in her memory.", "But if grandma is gone and doesn\u2019t have to listen to it, it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to hear the name, like it and use it as a family name. \n\nI\u2019m guessing Evangeline was an old lady name 30-50 years ago and Angie was much more hip. \n\nWhereas to me, a 46yo, I associate Angie as an aging name similar to Karen (Karen 20 years ago not the association Karen has become) and much prefer Evangeline. \n\nEve isn\u2019t common enough to be associated with a specific generation. Although I think Ava will be in 30-40 years.", "I didn't actually know how my sister would respond. It was 50/50 but I knew what mom would say if I told my sister in front of her so I said nothing then and waited but yeah, she asked and I told the truth. Wasn't trying to make her change her mind on the name. Just to enlighten her about the truth.", "Grandma wouldn't see it as an honor. She told us that she told all her kids that if they had a child and named them Josephine she would not consider it an honor. She told my brothers and I the same. So grandma would not have been honored or touched by it. That might be okay to my sister but grandma hated her name even as an old woman. She wanted to die as Rosie, to have it in her obituary and on her headstone. That shows she hated the name.", "I knew I'd find at least one of you down here....", "They gave her the facts so she could make a fully informed decision.", "Honestly I think Josie would be a good compromise here", ">If sister likes the name she can name her daughter Josephine & the family can call her whatever they want. \n\nYou literally just described the grandmother's entire life and still glossed over the fact that they only called her by her HATED legal name. \n\nThe grandmother never wanted to be Josephine let's just say they indeed go with this name for their daughter and she happens to love it. Except only now you have some family members insisting in calling you Rosie because it grandma's actual preffered name. \n\nIt's the same deal being told to suck it up and ignored on what her name is because LEGALLY it's no Josephine.", "Remind your mother that what goes around comes around. And if you want to be really spiteful, commission a new headstone for grandma and see how long it takes them to notice.", "How vile can you be? I hope they all get their names misspelled on their tombstones, too.", "You can get her headstone changed. My dad did after his brother was deadnames hope someone changes the headstone for her.", "Why not put Josephine \"Rosie\" LastName????  That's literally how you're supposed to write nicknames in formal settings!", "Your parents and whoever else went against your grandma's wishes are the true AH's here.", "Probably because 60 years ago Rosie to grandma sounded hip and cool (like Rosie the riveter) but to your mom and aunts and uncles it sounded old and not hip.  \n\nAnd maybe hearing dad call her Rosie made them associate Rosie with a private pet name. I mean they probably just called her mom so maybe had no idea how much she hated the name.  Lots of people go by nicknames doesn\u2019t mean using their full name in future generations is only acceptable if they loved their name.", "Grandma hated the name for herself. However, new baby is an entirely new person. \n\nIf you flip the coin here.... Sister is being told she shouldn\u2019t name her daughter a name she likes because OP has negative memories of that name. So she\u2019s basically being ignored like grandma was.", "I think it's more that they listened to their grandparents and aunt who refused to acknowledge grandma by the name she wanted and insisted to everyone she was Josephine. Grandpa and friends were the only ones until my brothers and I to use Rosie. I feel so bad for grandma when I think about it. She even wanted Rosie in her obituary and on the gravestone and her wishes were not honored.", "I never said she shouldn't. I just told her the story. In truth I think she should use the name if she loves it but accept grandma would not view this as an honor. This is something she told her kids and my brother's and I.", "That is not what she told her sister she told her sister not to name her that if she was trying to honor the grandmother because the grandmother didn\u2019t like her own name. That\u2019s totally different than telling her. She doesn\u2019t like the name she\u2019s picked.", "I don't think this is the case really. It's not like she is naming the kid just for the sake of it and liking the name, she wants it to be a whole honor thing. She even specifically asks what grandma would think and the brothers answer that she'd just be like \"good name bruv\" at best and have no emotional pride or honor in a baby being called it. \n\nIt sounds fine to call the baby that name if you want. I don't see them dismissing the name itself. Just can't act like its a good honoring someone name when it undermines how they wanted to be referred their entire life and got ignored by others. \n\nLike I'm trans and it's a sensitive issue for me. It would be a dishonor to have my deadname used to \"honor\" me. If that's what an ill informed young family member assumes is something I'd find positive as other family members lied to them about their lack of respect, id find more honor in my chosen name and the actual situation around it being stuck up for than anyone being named after me. \n\nShe's just upset she doesn't get to honor someone the way she imagined, when she wasn't really that close as missed the chance to know her when well. It isn't about the name not being liked for being a name, it's the sister wanting to attach a whole meaning to it and can't handle the reality of her families disrespect to grandma.", "100% as soon as you can do it without them noticing or being able to change it get the headstone redone", "If I were your sister, I would want to know. I think you did the right thing. I bet if she just said it was a pretty name and it reminded her of your grandmother, you wouldn\u2019t have stepped in. Sounds to me like you interceded because of the \u201chonor\u201d part, which is inaccurate. \n\nHow much younger is your sister than you? I don\u2019t like her behavior but it\u2019s possible she\u2019s feeling insecure/left out by learning this stuff so late. There are a lot of family things my older sister grew up knowing that dawned on my little sister years later, and it was hard for her (9 year age difference). My little sister I think on some level feels like she wasn\u2019t part of the family in the same way.\n\nAnywho, NTA, and FWIW I don\u2019t like the name Josephine.", "You did the right thing. Josephine is a solid name on its own, but how would your sister have felt if she found out about the names after her kid was born?", "I truly do understand where you\u2019re coming from & I say this with all due respect... that\u2019s your opinion. You had that experience with your grandmother, your sister did not. She likes the name & presumably loved her grandmother by the name she knew her by. Telling her this story now serves no purpose .... Other than to reach your own goal.\n\nYou will not appreciate your sister naming her daughter Josephine. Your grandmother will not be bothered by a child being named after her.", "That's fair. \n\nIf g'ma felt the name was used against her will, you can see that her sprit would hypothetically be peeved to have it live on \"in her honor.\" \n\nIf sister just loves the name Josephine, she can. But if the goal is to honor grandma, I don't see what stands in the way of naming the baby Ros(i)e.\n\nNTA", "Hmm ignoring the person who actually knew and loved was loved by his grandmother Rosie and instead you complete stranger just know that his grandmother would not be bothered\u2026..", "Yeah this take is....not it. Username definitely checks out.\n\nCall people what they want to be called! Do you dead name people too? You sound like some who says \"but [birth name] is so pretty I'm gonna call you that\" or \"but I've known you as [birth name] your whole life!\"\n\nCalling someone a preferred name is not hard and it's not a big ask. Telling someone the preferred name of a loved one is not selfish, Op did it out of respect for their grandma.", "Grandma has passed. Her name can no longer bother her.", "People can have different memories of the same people. What is the point of telling sister now? She knew & loved her grandmother by her legal name... apparently no one corrected her that Grandma didn\u2019t like it until now. Why is it important she know now? She certainly can\u2019t apologize to Grandma for that.... I have to guess that Grandma didn\u2019t love sister any less.\n\nTelling people how the may or may not honor another person is really not okay. If sister still believes she is honoring her grandmother as she knew her.... that\u2019s okay. OP is uncomfortable with the name because they know that part of Grandma\u2019s story & they don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a honor. Sister was never privy to that information until now. Now she knows. She still can use the name.", ">Grandma has passed. Her name can no longer bother her.\n\nAnd likewise a name cannot please her either. Sister wanted to honor grandma, and has now been given better information on how to best honor her. Why are you acting like that's a bad thing?"]}
