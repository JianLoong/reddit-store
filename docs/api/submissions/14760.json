My mom was over the moon happy about it. My brothers and I looked at each other when she said it but said nothing right away. My sister said I was quiet about it and she didn't think \"the boys\" aka our brothers, would get it but she thought her only sister would. I told her I did get it but she should probably know that grandma hated her name Josephine and she wanted people to call her Rosie. My sister was shocked and asked why she never knew and I told her it was because grandma was sick by the time she was old enough to really remember her. My sister said everyone else called her Josephine. I told her most people did and she hated it.\n\nGrandma was Josephine Rose. Grandma hated her first name and the nicknames people called her (Jojo, Jo, Josie). She went by Rosie with friends and my grandpa called her Rosie. But her parents and her only sister told her she was silly for hating her name and called her Josephine her whole life. My mom and her siblings ended up ignoring what grandma and grandpa told them about grandma hating her name and would always say they were \"Josephine's kids\" and not Rosie's. Grandma was really bothered by it so my brothers and I would call her Granny Rosie when we were around her, so someone in her life would call her what she preferred. She was so happy and when she died, my mom and her siblings insisted she would be called Josephine in the obituary and never mentioned Rosie in it at all. My sister was too young to really remember the whole discussion and she wasn't even born when we started calling grandma Granny Rosie.\n\nAfter I told my sister she wanted to think some. She asked our brothers and I a few days later if grandma would have liked the honor name thing. My oldest brother said she wouldn't have seen her using the name Josephine as  an honor for her and likely would have said she just liked the name. She was like okay, went to speak to our parents.\n\nAll hell broke loose and my parents were asking how we could lie and disrespect grandma like that. My sister then said we just didn't like the name and it was terrible for me to lie about her disliking Josephine and going by Rosie when she could never name her daughter Rosie. My brother kept letters our grandparents wrote to each other. Each and every letter grandma was Rosie. She also wrote Rosie on IDs she had when she volunteered. \n\nMy sister conceded that it was true but said I still shouldn't have told her and only did it to discourage her from using the name.

I'm surprised by your parents.", "NTA. You're expressing the truth you and your brothers grew up with, and the letters back you up. Some serious side-eye for your mom on not respecting what grandma wanted to be called, though.", "Your sister is so lame. If she liked the name so much, she didnt need to use honoring your grandma as a reason.\n\nAlso, Rosie is such a cute name!", "I have to say NTA. It wasn't done maliciously; you were telling her the truth. You even have the proof of it. But people are going to remember others through their own memories. I doubt she'll change her mind.", "NTA, 1000%. Your grandmother chose her name. It was different from her given name, but no less her name. It was entirely disrespectful for your mother to refuse to respect her mother\u2019s wishes. It was fair for you to say something.", "NTA. You didn't say anything until asked and then told the truth. It sounds like really honouring your grandmother would be to follow her wishes on what her name was to her", "NTA\n\nIt's not really honouring someone's memory and presence if it goes against what that person themselves preferred. Your sister having such an emotional reaction to this new information is on her, and what she does from here is also on her.\n\nThere is no way you are a bad person for offering relevant information about a situation concerning the memory of a loved family member.", "NTA\nYou're trying to be helpful.\nI hope the compromise can be reached for her to be called Rosie which probably won't happen as your mom seems very anti it.", "NTA: Yes you did it to discourage her from using a name to \"honour\" the grandmother who hated the name. Which therefore wouldn't \"honour\" her.   \n\n\nNow if she loves the name and still wants to use it that's her business. She's entitled to do so, just don't claim it's \"honouring\" your grandmother.  \n\n\nThe only asshole here is your Mum.", "NTA\n\nBut I'm so angry for your grandma because she didn't deserve that disrespect from her family. Calling someone the name they are okay with being called is such a basic level of respect. \n\nYou and your brothers were awesome and really honored your Grandma Rosie.", "NTA. Your family dynamic sounds exhausting. And now you know your sister prefers you lie to her, but I bet she won\u2019t tell you which things to lie about, so for the rest of your life you will have this voice in the back of your head every time you interact with your sister, asking \u201cshould I tell the truth?\u201d I recommend naming that voice Josephine, to honor your grandmother.", "Reading this hurts my head. Look it was just fine to be honest about your grandma not liking her name. All you need to say to your sister \u201c definitely call you baby Josephine or whatever you want! I\u2019ll be happy for you!\u201d But the name wasn\u2019t will not be honoring her\u201d. Everyone can be mad if they choose and be done with it. Being mad at this is ridiculous. NTA", "NAH. \n\nSo fun personal fact: my Gramma A was just like yours'. She had a name her mother loved but she hated, so she went by the overtly feminine version of it instead. And then when I was little, everyone told me to call her \"Mimi Mel\" (after her middle name). Turn out she fuckin' HATED being called Mimi Mel, and FINALLY told me when I was, like, nine. It took me a few months, but after that she was the name SHE chose- Gramma A. \n\nIf your sister names her daughter Josephine, she's going to be honoring your great grandparents, not your grandma Rosie. And that's fine! It's perfectly okay of your sister loves a name that your great grandma loved; a bond between multiple generations that never got to meet. But your sister deserves to know WHO she's honoring when she names her baby. \n\nMaybe sit down with your sister and make sure she knows there's nothing wrong with her name choice, just that she's honoring a different ancestor then she intended.", "You're NTA. It's not as if you were trying to discourage your sister from using the name because you don't like it. If it's just about honoring Grandma, she should think again about Rose or some variation of it. If she really likes the name Josephine, she should use it, but it wouldn't be doing much to honor Grandma.\n\n>My sister conceded that it was true but said I still shouldn't have told her and only did it to discourage her from using the name. \n\nShe should be glad it didn't come out after the baby was born.", "NTA - after seeing the letters and so on it\u2019s unbelievable your sister would make that kind of accusation. You tried to help her honour your grandma by correcting a misconception of your sister\u2019s that really is only the result of her youth. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong.", "NTA the baby should be named Rose if she wants to honor the grandmother. If she doesn't, she can name it whatever she pleases. Bigger issue: the grandparents seem to have lost their minds.", "NTA at all! It\u2019s pretty typical for older generations to go by their middle names. We found out after the deaths of both my grandmothers that their names, were in fact, their middle names and what we thought were their middle, were their first. Honestly, if she wants to honor her memory she should go with what your grandmother preferred", "Honestly, I find it incredibly bizarre that your family is so insistent on calling your grandma Josephine. Like...why? Do they hate her or something?\n\nNTA but I don't think your sister's in the wrong for wanting to use the name Josephine, if that's how she remembers grandma. Because let's face it, naming a kid after a relative who's passed is more for the parents than for the relative.\n\nBut you're definitely not the asshole for letting her know about the name. Your family's reaction was way over the top and they're being completely disrespectful for insisting on using a name your grandma hated.", "NTA. Duh.\n\n\nAlso, Rosie is a beautiful name. My great-grandma, who I was really close to, was called Rosalia, so maybe I'm biased, but still.", "I am so confused ... why is everyone mad??\n\nShe can still name her daughter Josephine.

Wtf is that behaviour.", "But that\u2019s the thing it\u2019s all just on paper. If sister likes the name she can name her daughter Josephine & the family can call her whatever they want.

She no longer has a strong opinion on the name josephine. When we honor the dead we are actually honoring the living, those who loved that person.

Your parents are behaving oddly, to say the least. It's so sad to me that this woman made it to the end of her life and her children refused to acknowledge her preference for her own name.

Rose is a perfectly acceptable name. It doesn't have to officially be \"Rosie.\" It can still be Josephine. Just because her grandmother did not like the name doesn't mean her child will. It just doesn't follow as much as the deceased grandmother probably would have liked if she was strictly doing it to honor her with her grandmother's approval if she was still able to get it.", "NTA. My grandmother also hated her first name and used her middle name or the nickname that went with it.

We named my daughter after my husband's grandmother (who is still living). She lives in a different state that us and before our daughter was born I had never met her and heard her on the phone only once. \n\nGrandma has a unique name and was named after her father. Think \"Tommie\" named after a Thomas (not the actual names), most people assume it is a nick name and not a full name. We kept the name a surprise. Turns out grandma strongly disliked her name and always went by a nickname that started with the same letter. We had no clue. \n\nWe drove LO to meet Grandma and grandma asked if we were sure we wanted that to be her name. We told her we did and that it fit her well. Our daughter was 7 months by this time. She warmed up to it. The family loved that she was named after grandma.", "Or they  name the baby Rosie. Problem solved. Baby is named after grandma.", "NTA i don't get how these people ignored her wished for decades?", "NTA by far! My grandma was the same way.

Is pregnant sister the golden child?", "NTA your parents are weird.\n\nBut you should also help your sister to realize that naming her daughter Josephine and honoring your grandmother are not mutually exclusive.

If your sister accepts what happened to your grandmother and allows her own daughter to like or dislike the name Josephine on her own terms, your grandmother would be wonderfully honored.", "NTA. You are in a very lose/lose situation here. Had you not told your sister and she found out your grandmother hated her name years down the road you would have been a fault for not telling her earlier.

She said no! I bet that grandma would have said no too.", "NTA.", "NTA\nYou told her the truth about your grandmother's preferences.  She can do what she wants with it after that. Naming kids after people is kind of iffy anyway IMO as you don't know that the child will love the name of someone who died long before they were born. It is a bit different if they can get to know the person a bit.\n\nMy grandmother also hated her legal first name (Hazel) and went by her middle name. I did not know until I got a bit older because everyone used her preferred name. Her legal first name was included in her obituary and on her gravestone. My mom just told me that grandma hated her first name and she did not know why. I think Hazel is a fine name but if I were going to name my child after her to honor her then it would be the name she actually used and liked. My spouse was strongly against naming our child after anyone so we did not use any family names.", "I hated my birth name and changed it when I was a teenager. My friends have always called me by my preferred name, and it's the only name I've been known by in adulthood. My family, however, have never been happy with my decision and never respected it. It's actually part of an avalanche of reasons that I chose to become estranged from them over.\n\nIf one of my children wanted to call their child my birth name, I'd respect their right to call a kid whatever they wanted, but it wouldn't be an honour, I wouldn't feel complimented, and it would be a constant reminder of something and some people I hate.

Good work standing up for who she was and not who others insist on imagining she was.", "NTA at all. If your sister is really trying to honor her grandmother, she should name the kid Rose. It\u2019s baffling that your family could be so disrespectful to your grandmother and then continue to be so posthumously in the name of love.", "NTA - My god the amount of \"naming\" posts that are on this subreddit is *insane*. My sister was named after a great-grandmother that we never knew, and that horrific name was GLADYS. I'll never understand why, since my parents never intended on calling her that. My sister has hated this name her entire life and goes by her middle name. All to be named after someone that's a ghost we never knew.

At the end of the day she can name her baby whatever she wants, but it\u2019s a weird bill to die on.", "Yeah no that\u2019s my bad. I didn\u2019t remember that part and was thinking \u201cOkay, J for the Josephine and osie for the Rosie.\u201d", "But it is still an honor. A woman named Josephine existed, she may not have liked the name but it was still her name.  Sister has some memories of her and also really likes the name. It\u2019s no different than looking through your family tree and liking a name of someone. That little bit of connection is what finalizes your name making decision.", "I'm so confused by why, why the fuck are people so insistent on calling her Josephine. It would ruin my opinions of everyone that does it.", "NTA, 1000%. Your grandmother chose her name. It was different from her given name, but no less her name. It was entirely disrespectful for your mother to refuse to respect her mother\u2019s wishes. It was fair for you to say something.", "Oh look. A stolen comment replying to a stolen comment. Bot-ception. Downvote and report.", "You mean honor the great grandparents who picked the name and the parents who ignored the poor woman's last wish to have Rosie in her obituary? If she wants to honor these people then okay, but saying she's honoring grandma is not accurate.", "They\u2019re saying she\u2019s so young she actually doesn\u2019t have any memories of grandma though. She knows the stories her parents have told her and her sister said- when she was specifically questioned- grandma actually preferred her middle name so it\u2019s not quite the honor you think it is.", "Cuz sister wants to name the kid Josephine in HONOR of grandma who hated that name.  It's not to remember grandma.  That would be a different story.\n\nYou don't honor someone by a name they hated."]}
