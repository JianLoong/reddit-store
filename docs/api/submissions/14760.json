My mom was over the moon happy about it. My brothers and I looked at each other when she said it but said nothing right away. My sister said I was quiet about it and she didn't think \"the boys\" aka our brothers, would get it but she thought her only sister would. I told her I did get it but she should probably know that grandma hated her name Josephine and she wanted people to call her Rosie. My sister was shocked and asked why she never knew and I told her it was because grandma was sick by the time she was old enough to really remember her. My sister said everyone else called her Josephine. I told her most people did and she hated it.\n\nGrandma was Josephine Rose. Grandma hated her first name and the nicknames people called her (Jojo, Jo, Josie). She went by Rosie with friends and my grandpa called her Rosie. But her parents and her only sister told her she was silly for hating her name and called her Josephine her whole life. My mom and her siblings ended up ignoring what grandma and grandpa told them about grandma hating her name and would always say they were \"Josephine's kids\" and not Rosie's. Grandma was really bothered by it so my brothers and I would call her Granny Rosie when we were around her, so someone in her life would call her what she preferred. She was so happy and when she died, my mom and her siblings insisted she would be called Josephine in the obituary and never mentioned Rosie in it at all. My sister was too young to really remember the whole discussion and she wasn't even born when we started calling grandma Granny Rosie.\n\nAfter I told my sister she wanted to think some. She asked our brothers and I a few days later if grandma would have liked the honor name thing. My oldest brother said she wouldn't have seen her using the name Josephine as  an honor for her and likely would have said she just liked the name. She was like okay, went to speak to our parents.\n\nAll hell broke loose and my parents were asking how we could lie and disrespect grandma like that. My sister then said we just didn't like the name and it was terrible for me to lie about her disliking Josephine and going by Rosie when she could never name her daughter Rosie. My brother kept letters our grandparents wrote to each other. Each and every letter grandma was Rosie. She also wrote Rosie on IDs she had when she volunteered. \n\nMy sister conceded that it was true but said I still shouldn't have told her and only did it to discourage her from using the name.

I mean they\u2019re not really honoring her name if it\u2019s not her name. Yeah, on paper it is, and people called her that against her wishes, but those that actually cared about her called her the name she wanted, Rosie. I wish in this case they would name their daughter Rose or Rosie, both are great names and would do what they want in honoring your grandmother.", "Sooo they disrespected grandma the entire time she was alive, and now they want to continue that tradition, but also get cred for \u201chonoring\u201d said grandma. \n\nSis should just admit she likes the name Josephine and it\u2019s not really about grandma at all. \n\nNTA.", "She wanted to honor your grandmother.\n\nYou grandmother preferred Rosie.\n\nTo use Josephine would be DIShonoring the grandmother.\n\nDoes your sis really want to honor your grandmother or was it just an 'excuse' to name the baby Josephine?\n\nNTA for stepping up for your beloved Granny Rosie", "NTA...honesty is always best. I'm surprised by your parents.", "NTA. You're expressing the truth you and your brothers grew up with, and the letters back you up. Some serious side-eye for your mom on not respecting what grandma wanted to be called, though.", "Your sister is so lame. If she liked the name so much, she didnt need to use honoring your grandma as a reason.\n\nAlso, Rosie is such a cute name!", "I have to say NTA. It wasn't done maliciously; you were telling her the truth. You even have the proof of it. But people are going to remember others through their own memories. I doubt she'll change her mind.", "NTA, 1000%. Your grandmother chose her name. It was different from her given name, but no less her name. It was entirely disrespectful for your mother to refuse to respect her mother\u2019s wishes. It was fair for you to say something.", "NTA. You didn't say anything until asked and then told the truth. It sounds like really honouring your grandmother would be to follow her wishes on what her name was to her", "NTA\n\nIt's not really honouring someone's memory and presence if it goes against what that person themselves preferred. Your sister having such an emotional reaction to this new information is on her, and what she does from here is also on her.\n\nThere is no way you are a bad person for offering relevant information about a situation concerning the memory of a loved family member.", "NTA\nYou're trying to be helpful.\nI hope the compromise can be reached for her to be called Rosie which probably won't happen as your mom seems very anti it.", "NTA: Yes you did it to discourage her from using a name to \"honour\" the grandmother who hated the name. Which therefore wouldn't \"honour\" her.   \n\n\nNow if she loves the name and still wants to use it that's her business. She's entitled to do so, just don't claim it's \"honouring\" your grandmother.  \n\n\nThe only asshole here is your Mum.", "NTA\n\nBut I'm so angry for your grandma because she didn't deserve that disrespect from her family. Calling someone the name they are okay with being called is such a basic level of respect. \n\nYou and your brothers were awesome and really honored your Grandma Rosie.", "NTA. Your family dynamic sounds exhausting. And now you know your sister prefers you lie to her, but I bet she won\u2019t tell you which things to lie about, so for the rest of your life you will have this voice in the back of your head every time you interact with your sister, asking \u201cshould I tell the truth?\u201d I recommend naming that voice Josephine, to honor your grandmother.", "Reading this hurts my head. Look it was just fine to be honest about your grandma not liking her name. All you need to say to your sister \u201c definitely call you baby Josephine or whatever you want! I\u2019ll be happy for you!\u201d But the name wasn\u2019t will not be honoring her\u201d. Everyone can be mad if they choose and be done with it. Being mad at this is ridiculous. NTA", "NAH. \n\nSo fun personal fact: my Gramma A was just like yours'. She had a name her mother loved but she hated, so she went by the overtly feminine version of it instead. And then when I was little, everyone told me to call her \"Mimi Mel\" (after her middle name). Turn out she fuckin' HATED being called Mimi Mel, and FINALLY told me when I was, like, nine. It took me a few months, but after that she was the name SHE chose- Gramma A. \n\nIf your sister names her daughter Josephine, she's going to be honoring your great grandparents, not your grandma Rosie. And that's fine! It's perfectly okay of your sister loves a name that your great grandma loved; a bond between multiple generations that never got to meet. But your sister deserves to know WHO she's honoring when she names her baby. \n\nMaybe sit down with your sister and make sure she knows there's nothing wrong with her name choice, just that she's honoring a different ancestor then she intended.", "You're NTA. It's not as if you were trying to discourage your sister from using the name because you don't like it. If it's just about honoring Grandma, she should think again about Rose or some variation of it. If she really likes the name Josephine, she should use it, but it wouldn't be doing much to honor Grandma.\n\n>My sister conceded that it was true but said I still shouldn't have told her and only did it to discourage her from using the name. \n\nShe should be glad it didn't come out after the baby was born.", "NTA - after seeing the letters and so on it\u2019s unbelievable your sister would make that kind of accusation. You tried to help her honour your grandma by correcting a misconception of your sister\u2019s that really is only the result of her youth. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong.", "NTA the baby should be named Rose if she wants to honor the grandmother. If she doesn't, she can name it whatever she pleases. Bigger issue: the grandparents seem to have lost their minds.", "NTA at all! It\u2019s pretty typical for older generations to go by their middle names. We found out after the deaths of both my grandmothers that their names, were in fact, their middle names and what we thought were their middle, were their first. Honestly, if she wants to honor her memory she should go with what your grandmother preferred", "Honestly, I find it incredibly bizarre that your family is so insistent on calling your grandma Josephine. Like...why? Do they hate her or something?\n\nNTA but I don't think your sister's in the wrong for wanting to use the name Josephine, if that's how she remembers grandma. Because let's face it, naming a kid after a relative who's passed is more for the parents than for the relative.\n\nBut you're definitely not the asshole for letting her know about the name. Your family's reaction was way over the top and they're being completely disrespectful for insisting on using a name your grandma hated.", "NTA. Duh.\n\n\nAlso, Rosie is a beautiful name. My great-grandma, who I was really close to, was called Rosalia, so maybe I'm biased, but still.", "I am so confused ... why is everyone mad??\n\nShe can still name her daughter Josephine. It won\u2019t dishonor your grandmother. \n\nNames honor the person, not their name. \n\nNTA", ">My sister conceded that it was true but said I still shouldn't have told her and only did it to discourage her from using the name.\n\nShe's right, you did tell her to discourage from using the name Josephine, cuz your grandma wouldn't have liked it... duh...\n\nIf she likes the name, then she can keep it, but won't be honouring anybody ..\n\nNTA.", "YTA it\u2019s not that big of a deal. You should of let your sister honor her grandma in the way she remembered her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your parents sounds like assholes though. Firstly for not respecting what she wanted and secondly and very importantly for calling you a liar and lying themselves to make you look in the wrong. Wtf is that behaviour.", "But that\u2019s the thing it\u2019s all just on paper. If sister likes the name she can name her daughter Josephine & the family can call her whatever they want. It\u2019s not a dishonor to grandma. Sister & new baby shouldn\u2019t be punished because other people disrespected grandma. \n\nMy daughter is named after her great-grandmother. Grandma was known to everyone by Annie. My daughter is know by Lily. Both of their legal name - Elizabeth Anne. My grandmother thought Elizabeth was too stuffy for herself but she adored my daughter was thrilled they shared a name.", "Yes and even went against her wishes for her obituary. She wanted to be called Rosie in it. Also requested it for her headstone. Josephine is on everything because her kids didn't want to honor what she wanted.", "I think it's a little of both. She wanted to honor our grandma but loves the name Josephine and doesn't like that it's not a true honor for her, and the fact grandma wouldn't have liked it. She could just use Josephine because she loves it and not as an honor to grandma.", "Mom and her siblings followed the lead of their grandparents and aunt. Dad followed mom's lead. But I always listen to what others want to be called and don't tell someone else what their name is.", "Not just mom. All my grandma's kids and kids in-law use the legal name over the name she wanted to be called. They all listened to and followed their grandparents and aunt.", "Agreed re side eye.\n\nMy Gammas legal name was Lillian, but she didn't like it and went by Joyce (middle name). I couldn't imagine anyone calling her Lillian.", "I love Rosie too. Considered it for my own daughter but we want with honoring people in more unique ways for our kids, that made their names just a little different.", "She was too little to remember and it's not an honor to name someone after someone you loved that hated her birth name.", "But the family can\u2019t call her whatever they want because that would be extremely rude (unless the parents said otherwise). It doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re doing what you did with the same first and middle. The thing is, they are disrespecting the grandmother by calling the daughter a name the grandmother did not like! Now that sister knows that as the case, proven true by the letters, I can\u2019t see how she thinks it\u2019s honoring her. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s a name she hated and didn\u2019t want to be called.", "Using the name she hated in her obit and on the headstone is truly vile. Tell your mother and her siblings that you all plan to carry on their tradition and write something equally vile in their obits!", "I'm so confused by why, why the fuck are people so insistent on calling her Josephine. It would ruin my opinions of everyone that does it.", "Just do what my grandma did and tell her all the kids will call her Josephine Gross-ephile.\n\nEvery time my mom said I like this name! Her Mum would think of whatever annoying mean kid name twist they might get called on the playground. I was told she ruined about 10 names this way.\n\nSeriously though NTA, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem to refer to your Grandmother as Rosie. That\u2019s how you know her, and your mom can call her Josephine because that\u2019s how she decided to know her. They\u2019re the ones who can\u2019t even remember what name she liked.", "That's awful of them. I'm sorry your grandma had to deal with that, but I'm glad she had you and your brothers supporting her at least."]}
