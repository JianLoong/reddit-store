She is an overweight person, which never bothered me whatsoever and I\u2019m myself also not a thin person, but I\u2019m just a little above average for my hight and age. \nFor the last couple of months my roommate, who was always chill about her weight and appearance became literally OBSESSED with some crazy internet diets, to the point when she could go for 3 days on 3 apples and lemon water. I tried talking to her about going to an actual doctor who could prescribe her a HEALTHY diet that would actually help her to lose weight and not ruin her body and she always agreed to me but never went to a doctor. Okay. I\u2019m not her mother to tell her what to do, so I dropped the topic. But for the last couple of weeks being home was a nightmare. She became aggressive and started blaming me on the fact that she always fails to follow her diets because I \u201ccook delicious meals that smell so good that she can\u2019t help but feel hungry just from the smell\u201d. And I do cook delicious meals for myself. Because I like to cook and I like to eat. And I am NOT on a diet. Okay. I tried to eat more often in cafes and restaurants not to bother her with all the smells from my cooking, but as a student I don\u2019t have so much money to eat in restaurants every day, so eventually I still cooked for myself at home. I also tried cooking and eating when she\u2019s not around, but it\u2019s hard to do, because we are usually both home at the same time. \nLast night was the last straw. I made myself a traditional dish of my country that I felt very proud about, because it was the first time when I managed to cook it the way my mother always did and it made me a little homesick when I ate it. When my roommate stormed into the apartment she was already furious. She threw a tantrum about her smelling my food all the way across the hall and that I\u2019m personally the reason why she can\u2019t lose weight. She then took a pot, that was still half full and dumped it into sink. I was furious and for the first time since this all began I screamed at her and particularly said that it is not my fault that she\u2019s overweight and that she don\u2019t have enough strength to lose weight if she wants to do so this much. She was very offended by that and doesn\u2019t speak to me ever since. I don\u2019t know what to think and what to do. We were good friends until it all happened and now I feel like I said some messed up thing and made her even more insecure than she\u2019s already is\u2026 AITA?\n\n(I also want to point out that I\u2019m an international student, and I\u2019m still adapting to properly speaking in English, so please bear with me if I made some mistakes)", "created_utc": 1680894977, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ew0z6/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_that_her_weight_is/", "score": 312, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is great to have the support of family and friends, but the person wanting to lose weight needs to be all in, or they will fail.\n\nSide note - There are plenty of ways to cook delicious but also healthy meals at home. Home cooking is much better for health in the long run as you know all the ingredients going in, and you are generally eating whole foods rather than packaged food high in fats and sugar.", "NTA. Her lack of willpower is her problem, not yours. As for throwing your food - that's horrible. You've been more than accommodating to her stupidity. Is there any way you can switch roomates? She sounds awful.", "NTA and she better reimburse you for that food she threw in the sink!", "NTA. Y\u2019all are both adults. This is not a case of a parent only offering bad nutrition/the wrong diet. This is a case of no one shoveling food down her throat, but her. Her weight, her own fault. It\u2019s not fat shaming. It\u2019s not sabotage. She needs accountability and willpower.\n\nYou\u2019re not responsible for her, her diet, her health, nor her temper tantrums. She was wrong to have a she hulk rage fit and destroy your food. If she doesn\u2019t want to talk to you, so be it. She is a rude person.", "As a far person, NTA. You live there too and can cook whatever you want. It is up to her to control what she ears or doesn\u2019t eat.", "NTA she\u2019s probably swinging from starvation to binge eating, which is why she can\u2019t lose weight. It\u2019s also going to continue to control her emotions, which will lead to more similar outbursts. (I\u2019m speaking from past experience as someone who has a history of Binge-eating disorder). It may be beneficial for you to consider other accommodations when you can. Unless she gets help, there\u2019s a long road ahead.", "NTA - I\u2019d of yelled too, it\u2019s out of order for her to throw away your food and whilst perhaps a little harsh, what you said wasn\u2019t untrue. Her weight is not your problem and it\u2019s a simple as that. \n\nthese stupid faddy diets are the worst thing she can be doing. Surviving off apples is going to make her irritable as fuck and she may lose a bit of weight initially but then her body will go into starvation mode then she\u2019ll be upset she isn\u2019t really losing weight as well as irritable through lack of proper sustenance, then when she eats normally she\u2019ll pile more on than she\u2019s lost and be even more pissed off. The best way I ever found of losing weight was not to deny myself anything, moderation and decent healthy food. I eat super healthy meals Monday to Friday but if I fancy a bit of chocolate or something then I have it cus otherwise I just crave it and end up eating a shit load of it when I finally give in instead of just having a couple of pieces when I fancy, Saturday I treat myself to a takeaway and Sunday I eat something neither super healthy or super unhealthy. I found that way I don\u2019t fall off the wagon because it\u2019s just become my eating habit. I lost over 5 stone like that without ever feeling like I was dieting. Sounds like you have been more than accommodating and supportive already and you shouldn\u2019t have to change what you\u2019re doing when you don\u2019t have a problem. If you want to be nice and she stops being a stroppy idiot at some point and talks to you again perhaps you could help her find a better approach which helps her and stops her turning into a hangry monster. Equally you\u2019re not her mum, it\u2019s not your responsibility and she\u2019s a grown ass adult but it might make your shared living arrangements a bit more pleasant if she\u2019s eating healthier and not effectively starving herself. For sure though never feel guilty for cooking and eating what you want to eat in your own home. If she wants to lose weight she has to take responsibility for it herself and stop blaming others. If my coworkers bring cake in the office I say no (or occasionally yes), I certainly don\u2019t throw it in the bin. She\u2019s going to encounter food that\u2019s not diet friendly everywhere. She needs to learn how to deal with it", "NTA\nAs someone who once had a diet goal set and also lived with her family that would what they were used to:  bread, Coke, desserts,  there would always smell because grandma cooks nice dishes everyday... It was up to me to keep me accountable since the temptation was always there. If I decided to eat, it was my fault/choice. \n\nYou need to be focus, driven and compromised on your diet. It's only one's responsability.", "NTA, and she's being a huge jerk. None of this is your responsibility to fix, but since she is your friend and it seems like you both would like to maintain that friendship and see her happy and healthy please tell her she's so hangry she's being a nightmare to herself and everyone around her, and do what you can to get her to make that doctor's appt or an appointment with a dietitian.", "NTA Your roommate had that coming. Her weight issues are not your issues. You're allowed to cook whenever and whatever you want. If your roommate doesn't have that much control over her eating then that's on her. The next time she throws something away tell her to either look for her own place or for a new roommate because you're moving out.", "your english was stellar. \n\nyour diet is none of her business and you have a right to cook your own food for your own nourishment in your own home. she's welcome to be upset about the temptation, but she's not welcome to project it onto you. she should get a journal and see a therapist about the disordered eating she's engaging in. nta.", "Hopping onto the top comment to say, OP your English is excellent.

She should lock her in the bedroom if you\u2019re cooking and eating. It was so rude of her to throw the dish you made. Who\u2019s fault was it that she is overweight? Her genes or her overeating? Not your problem. This is why I didn\u2019t like having a roommate before and just had my own condo unit because I do not want to have problems with someone or other people like living in a dorm. Most people bring probs and drama.\n\nDo not apologize if she doesn\u2019t apologize first.", "She's \"hangry.\"  Dangle a Snickers bar in front of her.

She should also seek therapy and professional help with her diet because she's clearly too dumb to do her own research.", "Nta and she owes you money for your food that she threw away. She should be ashamed of herself throwing a tantrum and stealing from you like that because she is too weak willed to meet her goals.", "NTA \u2014 your roommate is projecting on you instead of taking accountability for the fact that her diets are not sustainable. Time for a new roomie maybe?", "You're friend is the AH.  As you said in your question.  Her weight is not your problem.", "NTA Tell her that if she throws anymore of your food away she will be not have to worry about losing wt.", "NTA. I'd be paying for your groceries so I could eat some. She needs some portion control or something.", "NTA.  Isn't the point of cooking to make food you'd actually want to eat?  Does she expect you to deliberately cook horrible-smelling food to make her not want to eat?  Her blaming you for her problem is just a refusal to accept responsibility for her problem.", "NTA get out of that apartment arrangement", "Did you sit on her and shove a fork in her mouth? - No, then it is not your fault. It is hers. You are NTA.", "She is in the middle of disordered eating and that takes a toll on the how your brain works.

NTA..", "So she\u2019s offended that you said she too weak to stay on a diet, which is truth. But you\u2019re not allowed to be offended that she stole your food, that you cooked, in Your apartment? What a self centered, egotistical, close minded, hypocritical hangry little B!", "NTA: if someone did that to my food, there would be fists coming out. Lissen, as a big lad myself, I can tell you one thing: your friend was never fine with her weight and she was bottling it up, and not it caught up to her. If smelling good food is enough to break your will, then you will never be thin: that is a fucking fact, as simple as 2+2=4. You might be international student, but let me teach you something: always stand your ground and don't let anyone belittle yourself. And stay safe too.", "I would like to thank you for writing this comment. Today I learned ahaha\n\nETA: NTA!", "Wait..she dumped out your food? You need a new roommate.  NTA.", "NTA.
