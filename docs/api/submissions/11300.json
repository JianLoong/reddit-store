I would be worried about anyone brining a child into such a squalid environment, let alone a newborn. Is there a reason your friend is living this way?

If she wants to have and keep a child then that child deserves some basics like a clean home and not be brought into absolute filth. She\u2019s choosing to live in squalor and neglect.

Not to mention the dog isn\u2019t fed properly. \nYou think that won\u2019t extend to the kid?\n\nYou are underestimating the impact a dirty house has on a child. I grew up constantly getting illnesses and infections because of those conditions. It\u2019s not just gross, it\u2019s unsafe and neglectful. Neglect is as bad as abuse. \n\n\u201cThis happens in third world countries\u201d isn\u2019t making the point you think it\u2019s making.

If she wants to live in squalor let her. Report her to animal control & social services. If she can starve and neglect a dog she'll do it to a child. Right now you're enabling her. She needs parenting classes before the child comes and obviously some sort of therapy, especially if she's been abused like you said."]}
