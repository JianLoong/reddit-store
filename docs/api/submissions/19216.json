You have literally witnessed this person stealing and have had valuable things go missing after her visit. Your roommate is delusional.", "Um, NTA. You are just being logical.", "NTA. This is a reasonable precaution even if your roommate is offended by it. Your past experience with her sister has told you to keep your stuff locked up.\n\nTrust is a given until it's broken, then it has to be earned back - if that's possible.\n\nETA: I wonder if the real reason she's mad is because they planned to skim off your stash, lol.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s completely reasonable to lock your bedroom door, especially when guests are over. As far as your roommate getting upset- if the shoe fits, wear it. She\u2019s probably in denial about her sister being a thief.", "NTA.. Based off history regarding your roommate's sister, you are clearly justified. The fact your roommate is upset because you locked your door, when your roommate is very well aware of her sister's stealing at stores and your things went missing only when the sister came to visit, is concerning.\n\nWhen I was young, I had a girlfriend and her best friend would come over to my parent's home to hang out. My gf and I would disappear into my room and her friend would watch tv in the living room. Each of those four occasions things went missing (my parent's change jar, a walkman, albums, my wallet, etc.). I told my gf I didn't trust her friend and didn't want her coming over with her anymore. A few weeks later while at my gf's home I saw the empty change jar sitting on the top shelf of her open closet. Not a half hour later I saw my empty wallet in the drawer of her nightstand when she opened the drawer to fetch something. It dawned on me her friend was stealing the things and they were splitting what they had swiped.", "NTA are you sure your room-mate doesn't also nick your stuff.", "NTA. Seriously. You have an admitted thief staying with you. I would suggest a padlock.", "NTA. That better be one strong lock. You need a camera, as well.", ">after she visited last time, my vape, a pack of my edibles, and my money jar were missing. I told my roommate about it and she said I probably just misplaced them.\n\nDid they turn up? No? Tell your roommate they owe you for all of that. NTA.", "tell her she can\u2019t have her sister over. involve your housing management. she is a thief and a liability", "NTA and I find it suspicious your roomie is so mad \u2026 they (roomie and sister) probably wanted to steal your edibles and such again.", "NTA. It's your room and your possessions. Since she has a history of stealing, it's not unreasonable to lock your bedroom door.", "NTA and since she doesn't have a reason to enter your room it shouldn't matter to them that you locked the door", "NTA - actions speak louder than words and your roommate's sister's ACTIONS scream \"lock your door!\"", "NTA the sister is a thief and you're protecting your stuff", "NTA, I would have done the same. If you really wanted to keep the peace, I guess you could have done it more subtly, but for my part, I\u2019d want my roommate to be VERY aware that I was having tot and protective measures against her guest.", "NTA. Carry your stuff with you or give it to someone you trust to hold. If not WHEN something goes missing call the police immediately. Any issue you might have with the cops isn\u2019t as important as letting them get away with stealing from you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
