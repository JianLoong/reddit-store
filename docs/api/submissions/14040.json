I have extremely curly hair that has lots of winglets and always gets knotted. I have been really struggling to keep my hair neat as overnight it always becomes matted. One of my friends recommended I get a silk bonnet so I tried it and it worked like a charm. Every morning I woke up with nice hair and it really did stop it from tangling. Recently my black friend slept the night at my house and I put on my bonnet to sleep and she immediately started saying that I was 'blackfishing' and ' taking resources from black minoritys'\nI really need opinions on this as she has told a lot of my friends that I am black-fishing without telling them the actual reason.\nAm I stealing resources from black individuals? I really find it helpful but \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Most ppl don\u2019t care to understand a Black person\u2019s perspective on these matters, bc they simply are entitled and don\u2019t want to be told \u201cno\u201d. \n\nThat being said, NTA. Stripping others of \u201cresources\u201d is a bit overboard, as bonnets are not a necessity for hair care for all Black people. It\u2019s possible that she was taken aback, and thought that you were trying to either \u201crelate\u201d to or mock her culture by wearing a bonnet. With all that is going on, it\u2019s understandable that she would be sensitive to seeing that. However, she totally overreacted-esp with her FRIEND. She should have approached the situation differently if she felt some sort of way about it. It\u2019s your home and your hair, please take care of it as you see fit! Don\u2019t risk tangles for a friend who chose not to seek understanding and show grace.", "NTA and your friend has obviously not done any research about hair. Silk/satin has been long recommended for hair, and for all hair types. It\u2019s not blackfishing nor is it strictly used for and by black individuals. It helps with protecting curls, helps prevent matting, prevents bald spots and wear on the scalp and hairline, and even breakage of fine/damaged hair, there is not a shortage on bonnets, and unless you stole this from a black person that is the only way you would be \u201cstealing resources\u201d", "Unless you broke into a black person's house and stole their bonnet, I don't see how you are taking resources from anyone.

You're not pretending to be black nor are you appropriating. You're simply wearing a bonnet in your own home to sleep in.
