This is weird and I would secondguess my relationship if I were you. He's breaking trust and also raise doubt if he's more invested in making his parents more than comfortable than your shared future and plans. I'm so confused why he said he would put more money into your shared funds if he had no intentions of doing that.

As you potentially add children to this equation, it is possible that your finances will be strained even more. Strained finances because of the money he provides to his parents/family could cause resentment because your income would be required to do more for your household than his would. You'd always feel like your household is struggling while theirs is thriving. Eventually, you would grow tired of this dynamic and potentially end the marriage. \n\nI understand that this thing is deeply embedded culturally for your husband, so you need to decide if this is your hill to die on with regard to this marriage. Is it at all a redeemable situation with him and what is his mindset? If your husband never changes, can you see yourself getting the short end of the stick continually? \n\nThe bigger issue at hand is not so much the money he sends, as you knew about that and had no issue with it previously. The bigger issue is that he places more emphasis on doing for his family and keeping them happy than he does about keeping his word to you and lying by omission. Personally, this situation would be a deal breaker for me.", "NTA he is giving family money to his parents who'd don't need it, instead of saving towards your future as a couple. He is an AH for lying about cutting back the money he sends to them.", "I have no sympathy for you.  You are actually a bad daughter ons law who is getting in the way of a system of cultural and respect.  It\u2019s time to accept your lot in life. Stay as it is or go. Staying and bitching while having children will ruin everybody. YTA.", "NTA but OP in most countries having a helper work at multiple residences is illegal. Even if it\u2019s legal where you are it\u2019s amoral to hire someone for one job, caring for a household of two, and then demand more from them. The helper is a live in employee and is therefore vulnerable, and your SIL is taking advantage of her. This to me seems like a bigger problem. \n\nThat your husband feels overburdened by his family is also something you need to sort before having a child. Because there are obligations for grandchildren as well and if your husband already doesn\u2019t have boundaries you are going to be bearing the brunt of saying no all the time.\n\nGood luck but seriously you need to step in for this helper.", "And OP's as well. The IL's indulgences will always come before both OP and her kids.\n\nI'm sure you implied that - but sometimes it needs to be explicitly spelled out. So many people will allow themselves to be treated poorly, but when they picture it happening to those they love, it finally clicks.", "I think this is an important thing to mention, too: what percentage of the husband's pay goes to the ILs and how much to their shared fund?
