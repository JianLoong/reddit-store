As you potentially add children to this equation, it is possible that your finances will be strained even more. Strained finances because of the money he provides to his parents/family could cause resentment because your income would be required to do more for your household than his would. You'd always feel like your household is struggling while theirs is thriving. Eventually, you would grow tired of this dynamic and potentially end the marriage. \n\nI understand that this thing is deeply embedded culturally for your husband, so you need to decide if this is your hill to die on with regard to this marriage. Is it at all a redeemable situation with him and what is his mindset? If your husband never changes, can you see yourself getting the short end of the stick continually? \n\nThe bigger issue at hand is not so much the money he sends, as you knew about that and had no issue with it previously. The bigger issue is that he places more emphasis on doing for his family and keeping them happy than he does about keeping his word to you and lying by omission. Personally, this situation would be a deal breaker for me.", "NTA he is giving family money to his parents who'd don't need it, instead of saving towards your future as a couple.

Even if it\u2019s legal where you are it\u2019s amoral to hire someone for one job, caring for a household of two, and then demand more from them. The helper is a live in employee and is therefore vulnerable, and your SIL is taking advantage of her. This to me seems like a bigger problem. \n\nThat your husband feels overburdened by his family is also something you need to sort before having a child. Because there are obligations for grandchildren as well and if your husband already doesn\u2019t have boundaries you are going to be bearing the brunt of saying no all the time.\n\nGood luck but seriously you need to step in for this helper.", "And OP's as well. The IL's indulgences will always come before both OP and her kids.\n\nI'm sure you implied that - but sometimes it needs to be explicitly spelled out. So many people will allow themselves to be treated poorly, but when they picture it happening to those they love, it finally clicks.", "I think this is an important thing to mention, too: what percentage of the husband's pay goes to the ILs and how much to their shared fund?

Why can\u2019t him or his wife do household work to minimize that expense? I would consider withholding funds for the simple fact I wouldn\u2019t want to be enabling them (and you by extension) being taken advantage of. \n\nAs for your husband not doing what you asked him to do? Well point blank that makes him an AH if he hasn\u2019t held up his end of an agreement. He said he\u2019d do X, now he\u2019s becoming defensive for you calling him out on NOT doing X.

I mean she is abusing the helper by bringing in her own laundry and eating free meals...", "Info: is this in the US or are we talking about another country/a different culture here? I don\u2019t want to give a judgement that might be culturally insensitive since I know taking care of parents is an ingrained duty in some cultures.", "NTA\n\nBut you have some very difficult decisions to make. \n\nYour husband is prioritising his parents and his siblings over you and his future children.  I doubt this will change and only you can make the decision on whether you are happy with living like this.\n\nHe's been groomed for this.  His parents have controlled him his entire life.  And he takes his anger out on you (calling you controlling) when that behaviour is called out because he hasn't got the balls to actually stand up to his parents and put his immediate family first.

They don't want to change the other kids behaviours and allow them to get do what they do... all on the dime of your husband (and consequent disadvantage to you).\n\nUnless something very drastic happens this is very unlikely to change.

Because if he isn\u2019t willing to do this I\u2019m pretty sure he isn\u2019t helping you financially with a child. What happens if something happens to his job?
