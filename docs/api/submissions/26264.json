As you potentially add children to this equation, it is possible that your finances will be strained even more. Strained finances because of the money he provides to his parents/family could cause resentment because your income would be required to do more for your household than his would. You'd always feel like your household is struggling while theirs is thriving. Eventually, you would grow tired of this dynamic and potentially end the marriage. \n\nI understand that this thing is deeply embedded culturally for your husband, so you need to decide if this is your hill to die on with regard to this marriage. Is it at all a redeemable situation with him and what is his mindset? If your husband never changes, can you see yourself getting the short end of the stick continually? \n\nThe bigger issue at hand is not so much the money he sends, as you knew about that and had no issue with it previously. The bigger issue is that he places more emphasis on doing for his family and keeping them happy than he does about keeping his word to you and lying by omission. Personally, this situation would be a deal breaker for me.", "NTA he is giving family money to his parents who'd don't need it, instead of saving towards your future as a couple.

Even if it\u2019s legal where you are it\u2019s amoral to hire someone for one job, caring for a household of two, and then demand more from them. The helper is a live in employee and is therefore vulnerable, and your SIL is taking advantage of her. This to me seems like a bigger problem. \n\nThat your husband feels overburdened by his family is also something you need to sort before having a child. Because there are obligations for grandchildren as well and if your husband already doesn\u2019t have boundaries you are going to be bearing the brunt of saying no all the time.\n\nGood luck but seriously you need to step in for this helper.", "And OP's as well. The IL's indulgences will always come before both OP and her kids.\n\nI'm sure you implied that - but sometimes it needs to be explicitly spelled out. So many people will allow themselves to be treated poorly, but when they picture it happening to those they love, it finally clicks.", "I think this is an important thing to mention, too: what percentage of the husband's pay goes to the ILs and how much to their shared fund?

Why can\u2019t him or his wife do household work to minimize that expense? I would consider withholding funds for the simple fact I wouldn\u2019t want to be enabling them (and you by extension) being taken advantage of. \n\nAs for your husband not doing what you asked him to do? Well point blank that makes him an AH if he hasn\u2019t held up his end of an agreement. He said he\u2019d do X, now he\u2019s becoming defensive for you calling him out on NOT doing X.

I mean she is abusing the helper by bringing in her own laundry and eating free meals...", "Info: is this in the US or are we talking about another country/a different culture here? I don\u2019t want to give a judgement that might be culturally insensitive since I know taking care of parents is an ingrained duty in some cultures.", "NTA\n\nBut you have some very difficult decisions to make. \n\nYour husband is prioritising his parents and his siblings over you and his future children.  I doubt this will change and only you can make the decision on whether you are happy with living like this.\n\nHe's been groomed for this.  His parents have controlled him his entire life.

They don't want to change the other kids behaviours and allow them to get do what they do... all on the dime of your husband (and consequent disadvantage to you).\n\nUnless something very drastic happens this is very unlikely to change.

Because if he isn\u2019t willing to do this I\u2019m pretty sure he isn\u2019t helping you financially with a child. What happens if something happens to his job?

I would not wish for my husband to take up the largest share of caring (which looks to be the case) all while knowing that he is likely not going to get anything at the end of the day (came up once in a conversation with younger brother and parents - most likely everything to go to the younger sister and the other brother living at home)", "If I am employed by person A and their kids give them money to help pay my salary that does not make their kid my boss. Unless they want to pay me to clean their home too I am an employee of person A hired to help in their home only.", "Found the in-law account.", "Wow. So not wanting to finance the whole family is disrespectful? I can understand if the parents need financial assistance for necessities but to finance trips and support able-bodied family members is outrageous. OP's \"lot in life\" is to be her husband's team mate.", "Some cultures are just friggin' wrong. Simple as that.", "This isn't a parents issue, it's a partner lying and not following through on agreements. It's a slippery slope.", "This right here. OP, are you willing to see him treat your own child this way when they are older? And if they refuse to or can\u2019t fund your future, what then? He will be verbally abusive to them and you will go without?", "10% to his parents and 8% to the shared fund. \nNow looking to contribute 12% to the shared fund", "he stole from the household. they are married.", "yeah, that thread was interesting too because it mentions that although they were married, they were not living together. her other posts and comments point to a lot of issues with both her husband and a loooot of strife with her in laws. they were separated less than a year ago, but now looking at having kids, when they already aren't anywhere near the same page on finances. seems like a lot of ups and downs in this marriage tbh", "But it's not their right how they want to spend it if they're asking you for more because they're spending it irresponsibly! If they want to travel the world they can easily do that but they are instead spending your money on other perfectly able-bodied people that could be working for their own money. That's the problem. You're not just supporting them you're supporting everybody who is making life decisions based on your money", "So his parents want grandchildren from you but they aren't willing to let you save money for the procedures that will help make that a reality. And he's okay with that? Can you two go to a couples' counselor to help you two figure out where you are right now and where you both want to go? He's under pressure but so are you. Your eggs aren't viable forever and that needs to be figured into whatever he's thinking.", "You're Singaporean, aren't you?\nIf so, the Singaporean reddits or even FB groups might be more helpful since everyone here can't get over your husband's arrangements with his parents.", "Well I\u2019m really sorry that they\u2019re being so incredibly selfish and aren\u2019t showing an ounce of understanding for the position you\u2019re in. He will have to stand up to them at some point, and recognise their crying for the manipulative and unreasonable behaviour that it is, because wife -and hopefully child- need to come before parents. Its complex because of his guilt and them making him feel guilty.", "Some places where having household helpers are common, particularly if there are standard minimum contracts, expressly ban this because what happens is that the helper does the equivalent of multiple jobs but is only paid for one.", "No payment makes anyone my boss.  \nBut trust me when I say my parents are cool with me working their staff if they run out of things to do.", "Son has a plan the whole time.  Seems like she didn\u2019t understand. Shrug", "It is a husband issue. I never said it wasn't. \n\nWhy did he lie to OP and not follow through? B/c he would rather please his parents than keep his word to OP. He would rather give them money they don't need than to save for his future children. \n\nSo yeah, the husband is the problem, but the husband's inability to not give his parents a large chunk of money regularly is the source of his problem.", "It sounds as though your husband is not fully onboard with what you appear to feel are mutual plans, and the two of you really need to talk. It shouldn't fall to the two of you to help support his siblings and their families as well as his parents, but it seems to be. That said, you refer to 'us' in your post and he does seem to feel differently. Those differences in opinion need to be addressed ASAP, well before you have children. Good luck!", "OP are you sure this man wants to have a baby with you? Sounds like he's trying to shut down your concerns because \"his family\" (you're not part of it) is more important than you and your relationship.\n\nDo you really want to have a baby with a man who puts you not even second after his parents but doesn't even prioritize you as a partner over HIS whole family.\n\nNTA but you will be to yourself (and any future child you have with him) if you stay there and have children with him.", "Sounds like they keep separate finances so not so much stealing as going back on what he said he\u2019d contribute to the shared fund.\n\nOP should not have a child with this person until he follows through in what he thinks his priorities are.", "No , he didn't emptied they joined bank account. He can choose how to spent his money that comes from his job. \nShe is also allowed to do the same. If she wants to manage his financial decisions is a big red flag about her .", "Is this helper challenged in any way?", "That\u2019s called exploitation.", "He didn't stole, he contribute less . Also that he agreed to contribute more is not the same as he can afford to contribute the extra amount", "OK. I call it giving someone a job.", "I didn\u2019t say he stole. That was exactly my point.", "Call it what it is: exploitation."]}
