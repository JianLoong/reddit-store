He and I are long distance while he goes to grad school and I finish my degree in our home city. We've been together for 4 years and his sister was in my class so her and I have known each other a long time. We get along well but she's a really rigid person and sometimes it's hard to get her to see things differently. \n\nWe moved in together 8 months ago. I had a 6 month old kitten at the time that the building management approved. Their pet policy says no pets over 10lbs, he was 7lb then and they knew he was still a kitten.\n\nWell he grew up to be a long tall boy, he's 15lbs now. I came home the other day to see Gemma on the scale with him and saying he's over the limit so we need to tell our building.\n\nThis is crazy to me, why in the world would we invite an issue into our lives? What difference does it make? I see people walking around with English bulldogs and I know those dogs are way over 10lbs so *why* make a problem where one doesn't exist? \n\nShe's been stressing that we're gonna get \"caught\" and get in trouble if I don't go confess to the office and while I don't even think they'll care, I'm not gonna go invite a problem into our lives. She got really upset with me and said she'd go herself. I got a little mad and told her she needs to get her anxiety under control because this should be a non issue with her. I said if she kept pushing it, i would break the lease and force us both to move out so she dropped it but she's complained to my boyfriend and their family... my boyfriend knows she can be difficult and I should just appease her by lying and saying I told them when I didn't.

Bring a scale to your house one day? I agree with you don\u2019t invite a problem into your life.", "NTA.  Your roommate's anxiety sounds irrational, and may even suggest a clinical situation, if there's other supporting evidence.  \n\nThe choice for her seems clearcut.  Assuming she's not trying to get rid of the cat for other reasons (say, she doesn't like living with him), then she should just mind her business.  It's possible building management will find out about your extra large cat (XLC), and will opt to force you to leave, get rid of him or (most likely) charge you a $10 monthly XLC fee.  At that point she's free to leave with you, press you to lose the cat, or make you pay the whole XLC fee.  Until then, her anxiety doesn't seem rational.\n\nYour choice not to indulge / alleviate your anxious roommate's irrational anxiety is a rational and respectful one.", "NTA\n\nIt seems a bit wild that dogs over that weight are routine but your cat is not allowed? I'm with you on the - don't make an issue of it. \n\nSo long as you're prepared to deal with the situation should somehow the building management make it an issue.", "NTA\n\nI would spell out to your roommate all the possibilities of what could happen if Management finds out about the car.\n\n1.\tYou both could get evicted.\n2.\tYou could get a monthly fine.\n3.\tYou might have to leave with the cat, which would leave her paying the full rent until the end of the lease.\n\nIs she willing to face all of these possibilities\u2014being homeless? Paying the full rent?", "NTA\n\nI agree with you completely, why is she making an issue over nothing. They aren't going to come and weigh your cat", "NTA\nit looks like she\u2019s trying to create problems.\n\nI don\u2019t quite understand why you would choose to be roommates with your boyfriend sister. It seems to be a recipe for disaster.", "NTA.  She needs to butt out.  If you end up getting fined for it, that\u2019s your fine to pay not hers, so I don\u2019t understand why she is so persistent.", "15lb! He is a chonky fella.\n\nCAT TAX", "NTA. She's making problems where there aren't any.", "NAH - it sounds as if this is more about her anxiety than trying to cause you issues. You talk about her worry and rigidity, is she on the autistic spectrum? For some rules are more black and white. I agree that it doesn't need to be brought to management attention but perhaps you need a sit down conversation about how they approved him as a kitten with the expectation that it would grow, and since he was approved it's not an evolving situation.", "Ask if she'd like you to go ahead and move out asap then. I mean, if the pet policy is no pets over 10lbs and she wants the management to know your cat is over that limit, what else does she expect other than you needing to move out per the rules? NTA.", "NTA. The policy almost certainly means \"no large dogs\" in practice. It doesn't mean small cats are OK but large cats aren't. You're fine, don't borrow trouble.", "NTA. My first (and only) apartment had a weight limit of 35 lbs. My dog was 45 lbs once he was done growing. So long as the animal (and owner) are respectful members of society, no one is going to care.", "NTA\n\nAssuming you\u2019re on a year\u2019s lease and plan to renew it, one possible solution is to ask for the lease to be modified in four month\u2019s time. Depending upon your situation, you may be able to get your actual cat specified on your lease.\n\nIf there are dogs clearly over 10 lbs in your building, you are very unlikely to face any kind of consequences. But, if this is causing your roommate anxiety and she won\u2019t let it go, modifying the lease may be an option.", "INFO- is she naturally a worrier? Then NAH. Or is she trying to sabotage you somehow?", "NTA. But as someone with moderate/severe anxiety, I can see why she\u2019s worried - I used to catastrophise to a similar extent and it made me really ill. Perhaps you could try and be a little more patient than \u201cget your anxiety under control\u201d - it\u2019s rarely that straightforward and depending where you are, proper treatment might not be available or accessible to her. Perhaps though when the lease ends it would be best to try somewhere separate next!", "NAH. If she has anxiety, this will not leave her mind, take it from someone with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. However, if you don't tell the apartment owners, and you pretend that it never happened, you can claim ignorance, never having checked the new weight. I would suggest doing some research on why there's the weight rule, and see if the inciting incident for it applies to your cat. If not, speak to the apartment owners but mention you investigated and found there is no reason to be concerned.", "NAH : there is a policy and it\u2019s clear she is uncomfortable with breaking the rules and she will be on edge. She appears to be an anxious person. While it\u2019s your cat and your business, it becomes her business too as it concerns both your living situations. I think you should either confirm with management or lie, so you can keep the peace and she won\u2019t have that worry hanging over her anymore. I too am a anxious person and I can sometimes get caught up in little things like this: in your mind it\u2019s a useless policy and they won\u2019t care, in her mind this could take away her home or the cat, and it is possible that every time she sees the cat she could feel this anxiety.", "ESH. \nYes, you should just lie to her and say you told them.

If you are caught by the building inspectors, just tell them that your kitty is on a diet. Don't put him on a diet, btw. Or if you do, buy some very good earplugs.", "NTA...Who even sees your cat? Is the landlord/management going to send the scale police?", "NTA she\u2019s ridiculous. She either hates your cat or is just one of those annoying breeds of people", "Is she the weight police?", "NTA of course. It's a house cat, not a fucking lion lol. She needs to chill, maybe she doesn't like the cat and looking for an excuse to get rid of it.", "op=NTA\n\nIt's your known cat--if they really want to make an issue of a full grown cat then let them come way your cat themselves(Just gotta say under 10 lbs would not be normal for most adult cats).\n\nIf she was going to make it impossible for you to stay(by reporting your cat) then it is logical that you would want to break lease and find a place that takes your cat.\n\nIf you tell her that you TOLD them--then she might bring it up to them when you aren't prepared.  --so lying could have a huge bite in the arse.", "NTA-My cat was 30 pounds of Turkish Van, a tallboy, and no one would even think to weigh him except the vet. No one cares, she's lost a screw, because there is no problem unless she makes one.", "NTA. A 10 lb or a 15 lb cat are going to be the same amount of destructive in terms of clawing, odor, etc. So I doubt the office would even really give a shit. But I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to tell my landlord that I'm technically breaking a lease!\n\nI applaud your honesty, but if I were you, I'd tell her \"the landlord says it's fine\". I can't imagine a scenario where you get evicted because your cat is 5 lbs over the weight limit.\n\nOh, I nearly forgot: don't forget the cat tax. Let's see that chunkier.", "NTA. This is definitely a case of it\u2019s better to ask forgiveness than permission. Your roommate either has an anxiety problem that needs to be addressed or she doesn\u2019t like your cat. \n\nEspecially renting there are way worse problems for landlords to worry about than your cat being overweight. It isn\u2019t a big deal, as you said other animals in the building are over that weight and are still living there. If you are super worried you can always put your cat up when the landlord visits because in the US they have to give you 24hr notice before they enter your apartment.", "Aren\u2019t the weight rules basically only there because buildings/landlord don\u2019t want big dogs and the mess that comes with them if the owner is bad? Like my friends landlord was chill with a big ass snake breaking his weight rule but not a pit bull.", ">is she on the autistic spectrum?\n\nI don't know, she's not diagnosed. My boyfriend is though and he's speculated on it before so I think it's a possibility.", "she is, she tends to fixate on things. i know she loves my cat so I don't think she's trying to get rid of him", "Yeah I\u2019ve never seen a weight rule apply to anything other than a dog", "In that case I think you need to show some support for the way that her brain is likely wired differently to yours. I wouldn't say it's because she's autistic if she doesn't have a diagnosis, just spend a bit more time explaining your view. Perhaps agree that you will take full responsibility if an issue does arise in the future to help reassure her. Maybe also ask your boyfriend what he'd find helpful in that situation. I don't think anyone is an asshole here, you just have different thinking styles.", "Aah. She is probably really scared of any punishment then, maybe to appease her you could either lie or sit her down and explain why you won't be telling anyone", "It may comfort her to bring up that the rule was likely made as a liability for animals that would be outside and the damage that they could cause to another person while on the property and likely wasn\u2019t created with house cats in mind. It may not but it\u2019s worth trying", "NTA at all, you reported the cat to your building. They know kittens grow into cats.\n\nThe only way you would have to report this now is if your cat had transformed into a large dog.", "NTA", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is right. YOU are the Ah here.", "NTA\n\nYour roommate is an idiot lol", ">I said if she kept pushing it, i would break the lease and force us both to move out so she dropped it\n\nINFO:\n\nWait. What else was she going to accomplish? I was originally thinking it was a ploy to break the lease in the first place. After all you'd have to move out anyways if you couldn't have your cat there...", "NTA what does she think is going to happen? I really don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to evict you over a cat being five pounds over the weight limit, even if they wanted to it\u2019s really hard to actually evict people. She\u2019s making a massive problem out of nothing.", "It's common where I am to see rules saying 25 lb and under for dogs and cats.  I think they just lump the cats in.", "Yeah but I\u2019ve also never personally heard of someone\u2019s Maine coone being kicked out if it doesn\u2019t leave the residence. That was more what I meant. That usually so long as they don\u2019t go outside and aren\u2019t huge huge then it\u2019s usually not a problem. Not a 5 pound difference anyway", "NTA\n\nit\u2019s not like you had a baby lion cub and now you have a 300 pound lion on your hands??, \nOr less dramatic, a Great Dane pup that\u2019s not well over 80+ pounds.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a cat.\nThey allow cats.", "NTA. Your roommate needs to find better ways to occupy their time. Are they fuckin bored?", "I agree NTA but this is a truly terrible suggestion. The things you listed are clearly *exactly* what the roommate is worried about, and she thinks that if they\u2019re proactive about telling the landlord, the consequences will be less severe than if the landlord finds out on their own. Telling her these things will only make her anxiety worse and will cause her to ruminate on the issue more. Instead, OP should emphasize that the weight rule is mostly for big dogs, that the landlord isn\u2019t actively coming to check on pets\u2019 weight, and that the most likely scenario if they do find out is a small monthly fee\u2014those things can actually address her concerns and help her feel more comfortable, without just trying to scare her into silence."]}
