And are free to do so!! \n\nAlso - your physical abilities do not define you!  Do what you want/love to do!!  \n\nUnfortunately, your sister and bil got dealt a bad hand and they will have to figure out how to pay for the medical debt.  If other family members wish to donate or loan funds then that is on them.  But you are not obligate just because you saved some money to better yourself in the future.

Isn't that standard in benefit packages?", "If your sister is struggling with the medical bills due to income, hospitals will help. Also, she doesn't need a loan. She can make payments.

NTA, keep your money and never talk about it again to anyone.", "Nta, 12k is not a lot of money and that's all your savings. You need that money if not for school then you need it as an emergency fund.

It's awesome that you have a savings account, but it's YOUR savings account---not the family's safety net.\n\nYour sister should talk to the hospital and each person sending a bill. If you're in the US, she may qualify for financial assistance/reduced bills, which the hospital should have information on. Additionally, many providers have no-interest payment plans. She should call each provider and ask for the lowest possible monthly payment. We had one medical bill $10 a month on for like nine years. It was annoying, but we made it through. As long as you're making some effort to pay monthly, they generally won't send you to collections.", "Save that money.. Pssst You have to go to grad school to be a librarian.

Your sister is in a high paying field, and although teaching isn't exactly a path to riches it's typically an ok income with decent benefits.
