Because I am currently on my period, I had to wear a tampon during our time there and had extras in my bag. I used less of the extras than I thought I would so I had a lot left over. The tampons themselves are pretty cheap and packaged poorly one would say; the wrappers they are in are made of thin paper. When opening my bag in the car to take something out, I found all of the tampon wrappers were ripped due to the wet towels and swimsuit that I had stuffed in there. There was no place for me to throw them out as we were driving back so I just kept them there until I had the chance to throw them out once I got home. **Not once did I think of purposefully leaving any of the wrappers in the car.**\n\nCome this morning, I get a text from my friend saying that her boyfriend found one of my wrappers on the floor of his car despite my carefulness and that now I'm apparently not allowed to step foot in his car ever again because of it, his reasoning being that he just got the car professionally cleaned Saturday and before leaving to the water park made a point of telling us that trash, food and clothing would not be tolerated being left behind, and the trash in question being a tampon wrapper made it 1000 times worse cause it was \"completely unsanitary\".\n\nNow I've known this boyfriend for a few months now (as long as he and my friend have been dating) and thought we were pretty friendly with one another. I've been in his car like 4 different times before yesterday. Never messy, never fussy, not a single complaint from him. But now all of a sudden he wants to go to the extreme of banning me from riding in his car over, not a *bloody tampon*, not an *unused tampon*, but a *tampon wrapper*???? Like I get wanting to keep it clean but...yeah no, I still find that pretty childish. This is a 23-year-old man with a whole girlfriend we're talking about.\n\nI asked my friend if she would explain my side of the story to him, and that had I known the wrapper was there I would have picked it up immediately before leaving the car, but she refused because she doesn't want to start an argument with him so early in their relationship over something like this.  I know I'm going to be seeing him again sometime in the future, and we're going to have to confront the situation in some way or another since wherever we go, I'm going to be the only one taking the MTA. When I do see him, WIBTA if I told him how I felt about his decision regardless of how he feels, or is he justified in how he feels and I should just apologize without the confrontation?", "created_utc": 1689704823, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15367w5/wibta_if_i_told_my_best_friends_boyfriend_hes/", "score": 214, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
