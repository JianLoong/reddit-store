The tables were really close to others, I think she was trying to get reactions.", "Serious question, how do you do it? If I have a bad bowel day, no way that I can go to the bathroom for every fart. Half of them just come out without a warning and the other half is still like every 5 minutes.

IBS and IBD are heavily affected by what you eat, and everyone is different. I did a whole bunch of elimination diet trials (on my own by logging what I eat and how I feel after) to figure out what caused the most problems and eventually found that it was primarily meat affecting me. I went mostly vegetarian and try to stick with the Mediterranean diet and have had a lot less gut troubles. Could be good to take note of what foods don\u2019t cause you gas, and eat something in that realm instead of going without food completely?

Some vegetables too (raw and cooked). Milkproducts are hit or miss. I try to cut these foods out of my diet, but in all honesty, there isn't a lot left to make 3 healthy meals per day that also taste at least a bit. \nEvery once in a while, I eat a meal that is safe for me and it still happens. I know stress also has an impact, and if anyone knows how eliminate this, I am open for suggestions. \n\nAt this point I am already happy if it's \"just\" farts and not the debilitating cramps that even make me blackout sometimes.

Anxiety can be debilitating but it is treatable.", "Sure, if she knew in advance.", "Multiple specialists, specifically tested for Crohn's disease but I don't have it. \nAnd although stress does have an impact, there is no sign of anything anxiety related. \nThe only thing doctors could figure out was that it's caused by a combination of food, stress and probably also hormones. And this does seem to fit with my experience, but those are also things you can't eliminate or fix with medication.", "Ah, yes, the fun of IBS that's worsened by stress. Because then you start worrying you're going to have issues during X event. And then worrying that worrying will CAUSE to have issues during X event. And then worrying that worrying that worrying - you get the picture. I think it's good to avoid foods you know are likely to give you problems (I love ice cream but don't eat when I have important things the next day). But otherwise, as long as you're not being gross about (snickering every time you fart, lifting a butt cheek and farting AT someone, getting into a farting contest, etc), I wouldn't overly stress too much. It happens. It's a natural body function. If it's audible, excuse yourself."]}
