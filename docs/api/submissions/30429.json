Also new to posting, so bear with me. \n\nSo my (f21) mom (f42) wanted to take family pictures this year, the clothes theme being forest green + black. Her, my sister \u2018Jane\u2019 (f15), other sister \u2018Kelly\u2019 (f13), and Jane\u2019s friend (f15) went dress shopping. I was not present for dress shopping due to running errands. \nMy mom texts me a picture of a [dress](https://imgur.com/a/lr9KYEs) she wants me to wear while they\u2019re out shopping. I said it was cute, but I\u2019d rather try it on in person before committing to it. \nI come home, and I see Jane\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s dresses. Kelly\u2019s [dress](https://imgur.com/a/8DAPTQV) is a classy little black dress, not too OTT for family pictures. Jane\u2019s [dress](https://imgur.com/a/UU0kZNX) made my heart sink.\n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful dress, and Jane looks wonderful in it. I just felt really let down when I compared it to the dress my mom wanted me to wear. I also feel like Jane\u2019s dress is not appropriate for a family picture, but that\u2019s besides the point. \n\nMy mom offered to buy me the dress she picked out, and I feel really guilty because I don\u2019t want to sound ungrateful for refusing it.\nBut I would feel embarrassed to wear my dress next to Jane\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s, for family pictures that would be immortalized on social media, the fireplace mantle, etc. \n\nI may be the asshole for how I reacted because I told my mom I would rather not be in the pictures at all. \n\nShe asked why and I told her a vague excuse to avoid explaining my feelings. My mom is now upset with me, but she said \u201coh well, guess it\u2019s just us (her and my sisters) then\u201d when I told her I didn\u2019t want to be included. \n\nMy potential dress is not terrible on its own, and it\u2019s occasion appropriate. Just\u2026please look at all of them before judging. I feel like I\u2019m going crazy.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be in family pictures?", "created_utc": 1699253373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17owwa5/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_in_family_pictures/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019ve been you. \n\nThe way to NOT be TA is to do the hard thing and explain why - tell your mum you like the dress she picked for you but you\u2019ll feel out of place in the pictures with what your sisters are wearing. Ask if she would mind if you found a dress more in line with what they have, so the picture matches better and looks more cohesive. \n\nSay you\u2019re not trying to be difficult and you just want to look and feel good in the picture for all of you. \n\nIf you don\u2019t do that and stay out of it altogether you might regret it. And if your mum throws a tantrum because you want to match the vibe your sisters are giving off, well, just don\u2019t be in the picture because she\u2019s TA.", "To be honest your dress is my favourite here. But instead of going straight to refusing to be in the picture, tell your mum that you want a dress you'll feel great in and that dress is not doing it for you. Communicate, you know?", "NTA- I for one think the dresses for your sisters are WAY over the top and totally too something (maybe sexy? revealing?) for young girls. I would talk to your mom and ask if you could pick a dress that you like more. Nothing wrong with that at all.", "INFO: Why don\u2019t you just go shopping for a dress for the pictures?  Is there some reason you\u2019d be limited to that one dress your mom suggested?", "Can you gush over Jane\u2019s dress to mom? Like I know you really want this photo so I will try to rearrange my schedule to attend. My dress doesn\u2019t fit, but I am in L O V E with Jane\u2019s dress!!!

I actually prefer your dress of the three.", "NTA. I hate to say it, but that black dress is way too mature for a 15 yo and a formal gown for family pictures? Wtf? You need to be honest with your mother. Point out how the dresses aren't the same level of fancy and how odd it'll look in the pictures. If she won't compromise, bow out.", "The dress she picked doesn't fit with the other two at all. Tell her you want to go dress shopping with her or that you will go with your friends. Find a similar style that you feel confident in.", "ESH- you should just suck it up and be in the picture. But I\u2019m so confused on what the theme is here. The three dresses all look like they\u2019re for different occasions. Brunch, cocktail, and prom. Idk why you can\u2019t ask your mom to take you shopping to get a new dress. If she bought your sisters dresses, and it\u2019s for a family picture that she wants you to be in, then she should supply the outfit, and it\u2019s only fair it at least matches your sisters", "Info: why can't you pick your own dress?", "[deleted]", "Why is your mom dressing the teenagers like adults, but the adult like a teenager?", "OP, I've read through your comments and got a sense of the family dynamic, so I'll say NTA\n\nBut the dark green dress you've been asked to wear looks lovely. I know that Jane's dress is a brighter colour but the chiffon dress could look incredibly elegant with the right accessories. Maybe it's really not your style, but if it is something you might wear if it wasn't next to the other dresses, then maybe reconsider. Ignore the comparisons because objectively you will look chic and occasion-appropriate. \n\nYour family sounds really judgmental, but that's a failing on their part, not yours.", "I am a bit confused why younger girls would wear something that more suitable for more older persons. Like both dresses are beautiful but too sexy and revealing for young age (especially chosen for a family photo).  \nNTA - your feelings are totally valid, but try to communicate a bit better with your mother about your frustration. If you will tell her that you will feel better in something closer to the style of sisters' dresses, she might offer a help with returning said dress and buying something else while you are busy with college. Don't forget to mention that you're grateful for thinking of you and buying the first dress (to not hurt her feelings), but note that it is not quite what you wanted.", "YTA but it's ok, I know it's tough when you're in a photo and you don't feel you look your best. TBH the dress is super cute, and your mum is making it as easy as possible. I'd go along and just make her happy.", "Soft YTA , you should have been honest with your mother. Also they're dressing like that at 13 and 15 ?? I'm sorry my sister is going to be 13 and my mother would never allow her to wear something that tight that show her figure this way . Well , I guess children don't dress as children anymore", "NTA. The dress that has been picked out for you seems more appropriate for the 15 year olds and the one for Jane seems more appropriate for a 21 year old. Has she always done this?", "NTA. Take the advice in the top comment but I'll never understand why mothers do this to their children.", "Such weird dress choices... as people have said, the three don't go well together, and they're not all suitable for family pictures or the ages of your sisters... \n\nBut, looking at practical advice, you have got a few options.\n\nYou could discuss with your mother about the dress and aim for something different\n\nYou could get a second hand dress that's more suitable, since you say you have a low budget. I don't know where you are, but ebay and charity shops are ideal for dresses. You can even ask your mother for the budget for a dress and get something more formal for less than the cost of the chosen dress, I'm sure. \n\nYou could spruce up that dress. It's actually a beautiful dress (and definitely the one I'd pick for a family photo, if green was my colour). But if you added a sparkly / metallic belt and a statement necklace you could make it cocktail-style. Maybe a nice shiny hair comb as well. The other green dress will still look overly formal, and there's just nothing that can be done about that. \n\nUltimately it sucks that you invisible feel like the outsider and that you've been made to feel you are less deserving of nice things. But you have to start advocating for yourself and make sure you get the respect you deserve. \n\nBest of luck", "NTA \nYou would look ridiculous in that dress next to jane and Kelly. They have that cocktail party vibe while yours has a sunday brunch vibe. Tell your mom it would be better if they were all in the same category at least, otherwise the picture would look ridiculous and get a much better dress, please. \nTbh i was gonna say a soft yta before I saw the pictures. But no OP, you are NOT the ahole", "YTA you\u2019re overthinking & overreacting about a dress in a photo", "NTA\n\nBut this is heavily influenced by my personal opinion, which is finding family pictures stupid and just often an occasion to have a mental breakdown for some family members. Maybe someone should learn that not wanting to be in the pictures doesn't mean that you don't want to be in the family. You need to be a special kind of shallow to think that what brings a family together is a stupid picture.", "Kinda ESH ...those dresses don't match the occasion. Who buys a prom dress for a family picture? \n\nBut why can't you tell your mom that you get the feeling the dresses don't match each other? It seems you are making this more complicated than it has to be...", "NTA. I think there are some bigger issues at play here, around some very complex feelings about self esteem and worthiness.\n\nIf you want to be in the pictures but you don\u2019t feel you will \u2018match up\u2019 to your younger sisters, lead with that when you talk to your mom. If it important to her for you to be in the pictures then you can seat the photoshoot until you\u2019ve had time to go out dress shopping together and pick something that makes you feel wonderful, regardless of \u2018match\u2019 with your sisters. You are just as deserving of her splurging on you :)\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t let you pick something for you, then she is TA and go ahead and miss the photoshoot - but it really does seem like you would like to be included but are falling back on disengaging because you aren\u2019t being given the opportunity to be part of this on your terms.\n\nAnd to everyone talking about how \u2018adult \u2018 the sisters dresses are - 13/15 year olds are developing a sense of self and a sense of style. The judgement is a bit stuffy - it\u2019s not like they have suggested nipple tassels and a smile \ud83d\ude44", "Honestly, I looked at the images and your one is by far the classiest.", "YTA. Not wanting to be in your family photo just because you are worried that your dress is not as good as your sisters\u2019 is superficial at best. I understand you want to look and feel your best, and outfits are important to make the picture look presentable but what\u2019s most important is that it\u2019s a *family photo*. What\u2019s immortalized is the memory of your whole *family* being *together*, something we often taken for granted in the present At the end of the day, none of your dresses matter. No one is going to say \u201cEw, look at HER dress compared to Jane\u2019s. Gross\u201d And if they do, you don\u2019t want to associate with people like that. \n\nI understand why you would feel bad about telling your mom you don\u2019t like the dress either. But if you don\u2019t like it, communicating it is an option. Can you try to search for a dress on your own within budget and send it to her and say you have another option you may like?", "YTA, but not terribly so.", "YTA. Imagine the difference in feeling a little less attractive(if that\u2019s correct?) in a family picture, a feeling that will only decrease as you get older, versus looking at your family\u2019s picture and remembering why you\u2019re not in it. One of those you will care about in 20 years.\n\nEdit: not to be too harsh. You\u2019re young and it\u2019s okay to be self-conscious. Just don\u2019t let that feeling negatively impact you or your family.", "YTA. You need to communicate better you an adult. From her point of view you throwing a tantrum but with no particular reason.", "YTA, and also a 21 year old woman comparing yourself to 13 and 15 year old girls?", "YTA because you'd rather be jealous of a dress than participate in a family photo. Very petty. You're an adult and your siblings are not. You could have made time to find a dress if you cared enough about what you wear.", "YTA I'm afraid, others have given good advice already though.", "YTA. \nYou\u2019re literally the grown up there compared to your sister. \nThey went shopping, you didn\u2019t. They probably fell in love with \u201cprincess\u201d/prom-like dresses and your mom agreed to it. Your mom will not know your taste exactly, so she took something she thought you\u2019d like. \n\n\nYou could have just communicated it or gone with them and do your errands at a later time. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone would compare you with teenagers playing dress up, with if you\u2019re stuck that much on it, just tell your mom and get a new dress ?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You and Kelly\u2019s dress are actually a very similar level of dressiness, and personally I think Jane is going to stick out like a sore thumb wearing something so formal.

If that\u2019s too hard then go to shops yourself, try in outfits, take pictures of the ones you like and send your mom those pictures for her to also go to those stores on her own time. Give her like 3 or 5 options so she can still feel like she picked your dress even though it\u2019s a compromise because you\u2019re the one that gave her a list of dresses to ultimately choose from. \n\nThings don\u2019t need to be so black and white, there can be middle ground with other possibilities. Just because the option of the dress your mom gave you wasn\u2019t great, doesn\u2019t mean you need to say no to the entire experience. \n\nI\u2019m sure this is a defence coping skill you\u2019ve picked up from your mothers treatment over the years, but that doesn\u2019t mean you need to stay that way! Parents can cause trauma but once we know \u2018why\u2019 we react this way, we can attempt to parent ourselves and change our behaviours to a more healthy style. It\u2019s a lot of hard work but it will be so much easier and less stressful on you if you put in the hard work. Maybe look into some therapy or some self help books. You\u2019ll never be able to change your mom (or anyone) but you can change yourself to react, accept, or see things differently. Once you get there, your mom will lose a lot of power and influence over you and it\u2019ll be much easier to be around her when you need to be, talking with her should get much easier too once you\u2019re able to not let her hold all the cards. Best of luck, you\u2019ve got this!!", "You seem kind of defeated emotionally:( the fact that you would rather just not be in the family pic than say how you feel makes me feel for you. \n\nJust say the dress doesn\u2019t fit you and you need to return it and get a new one. Personally I would start a fight over this", "Lol who are you", "Okay, we\u2019ll then that is understandable. Just an idea, have you tried seeing if one of your college friends has a cute black or green dress you can borrow?", "I said it wouldn\u2019t fit my hips lol. I may have already started a fight by trying to remove myself from it. Thank you for your thoughtful responses.\n\nedit: for clarity", "Thank you for the suggestion. Unfortunately, I am a petite woman and none of my friends\u2019 clothes fit me.", "You deserve to feel beautiful and included in the family photos, not just there in the background with some random dress they picked out while your sisters get what they want. \n\nAnd see it actually doesn\u2019t fit so you can\u2019t wear it \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nMother daughter shopping trip is in order, maybe you guys can talk some of this stuff out\n\nI also might just be projecting my own older sister mommy issues on you also, so take everything i say with a grain of salt lol", "That sucks. I hope you find a solution you\u2019re happy with.", "I have a hint which is probably not very acceptable in the society but I used it once. Could you maybe order the dress online (or several to try them on), take a photo and then return it? Or to do the same thing in an actual shop. I did it once for the photo shoot. Maybe it's not the nicest thing to do, but if you don't ruin the dress, it might be okay. I don't know where you live and what are the conditions of buying and returning things, but it may work.\n\nETA: or more acceptable thing. Buy a dress and then resell it. I also tried it several times. With a good marketing you can even earn some extra\n\nI would also like to mention that if I saw a photo with teenagers in these definitely adult sexy dresses and a young 21 yo girl wearing this cute dress, I would be thinking that only the 21 yo knows what, where and how to dress up for the occasion. A 15 yo in this dress would bring me wtf feeling. I don't say you have to stick to this dress, absolutely not, but just don't think that they gonna be wow, their dresses are not very appropriate. And remember, it's not the dress that makes you beautiful, it's you yourself who is beautiful and no dress can change it.\n\nAnd just an advice, if you decide to go with this dress and photo, you can mention very loudly to everyone that it was your mum who chose this dress for you, she has a great taste, look how gorgeous etc... Maybe it's also worse mentioning that your sisters should have taken her advice too. Anytime somebody starts a comparison just go (loudly) how it was your mom who advised you to wear an outfit / to pose this way / to do a particular thing / etc. Make her the one responsible. She may get really pissed but there is a big chance that after a while she will get tired of it and just stops making you do stuff."]}
