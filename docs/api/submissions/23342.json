I work for very kind, supportive, and wealthy people. They are amazing! I\u2019ve never had better bosses. I am getting my degree right now, and I work at a bar they own. Todd has expressed his disagreement with my career choice, because he thinks bartending is full of \u201cdrama\u201d and doesn\u2019t like people flirting with me. I don\u2019t disagree, but it\u2019s really great money, especially since I work in a touristy area. I like bartending, but I\u2019m only doing it while I work on my bachelors. \n\nLast night during my shift, I was invited to go with my coworkers, managers, and the owners of the restaurant on an all expenses paid, VIP (they\u2019re 1/600 people in the world who have this pass apparently?) trip to Disney with a +1, and an unlimited fast pass. We\u2019d get into these secret restaurants, stay in special lodging, etc with this vip fast pass stuff. Sounds fuckin rad right? Im by no means a Disney super-fan, but I would be stupid to not take that offer, right? I texted my bf to ask him and he said he didn\u2019t want to go. I wasn\u2019t surprised, and here\u2019s why. \n\nAbout 3 months ago, there was an event being thrown at my work. I brought Todd down for a little bit. He met everyone, and it seemed great. Let\u2019s call one of the owners \u201cStan\u201d. Stan was absolutely trashed. I had never seen him like that, but whatever. He\u2019s a professional guy, usually never saw him drunk, at all. They shook hands and Stan started telling Todd how great I am, and that he better treat me well, because I am quite the catch! I don\u2019t remember how the conversation veered off like this, but Stan said something about that he loves boobs. If he didn\u2019t like boobs he would be \u201cgay\u201d or something. Nothing about me or my boobs. But still juvenile and kinda weird, but typical drunk guy banter. Todd got a horrible first impression, and has been pissed that \u201cthat\u2019s who I work for\u201d ever since. I never asked Todd to come to anything work related again, knowing what he thinks of them.\n\nI brought it up again today while we were with my mom, and Todd had a meltdown. He went off about how he would never want to spend a minute with \u201cthose losers\u201d (we really wouldn\u2019t be spending much time with them, I was told we would be on our own and probably just get dinner all together), that he would never take a \u201chandout\u201d from Stan, and that he would rather be driving his sports car, and that he\u2019s almost 25, \u201cway too old for that shit\u201d. I was just taken aback. I understand that Stan made a horrible first impression, but I felt like that reaction was not warranted. I said \u201csorry if it offended you that Stan and (wife\u2019s name) offered to take us on a free trip to Disney. I won\u2019t bring it up again!\u201d \n\nHe told me that he was \u201cso angry he could scream\u201d, grabbed all his stuff and left. Haven\u2019t heard from him at all since. Now I\u2019m upset that I will miss out on this opportunity, because if I were to go, he would be furious. I understand where he\u2019s coming from, but I feel like he\u2019s overreacting.

Stan getting drunk and engaging in inappropriate behaviour towards you should be setting off your spidey sense. This may not be a side of him you've ever seen apart from that one night, but it is a side of him that exists and can come out unexpectedly during work functions. Sometimes, elaborate gifts/trips like this can have hidden strings. It's not unreasonable to be alert for anything that seems off, or to be suspicious of Stan's motives (your post isn't clear, but I assume the owners are the ones who invited you and are planning the trip?).\n\nTodd is expressing himself in completely the wrong way, making things worse rather than better, but his concerns are not totally unfounded.

If he genuinely did not feel threatened or concerned about Stan's behaviour towards OP, and simply found Stan to be unpleasant company, then he could politely refuse the invitation, rather than getting angry at OP and insulting her for wanting to go.

Maybe your bar is low for adult men.", "No I'm not saying he's not an asshole. Im saying you're saying it's because he is insecure but also agrees that she should be wary of Stan.  So is it really insecure when it's valid.", "Yes, that's correct. Stan's behaviour can be concerning, and Todd can also be having an outsized response to it. In a situation where someone else might be creeping on his gf, a man who is SECURE might have a rational conversation with his gf and see how she's feeling about this behaviour and if she needs help telling this guy \"no.\" Someone who is secure might jump at the chance to come along, even just to keep an eye on Stan and ensure his gf is comfortable. A man who is INSECURE might throw a tantrum, act like a victim, and blame his gf. So, yes, Todd's behaviour is really insecure, even if the underlying concerns about Stan might be valid."]}
