I work for very kind, supportive, and wealthy people. They are amazing! I\u2019ve never had better bosses. I am getting my degree right now, and I work at a bar they own. Todd has expressed his disagreement with my career choice, because he thinks bartending is full of \u201cdrama\u201d and doesn\u2019t like people flirting with me. I don\u2019t disagree, but it\u2019s really great money, especially since I work in a touristy area. I like bartending, but I\u2019m only doing it while I work on my bachelors. \n\nLast night during my shift, I was invited to go with my coworkers, managers, and the owners of the restaurant on an all expenses paid, VIP (they\u2019re 1/600 people in the world who have this pass apparently?) trip to Disney with a +1, and an unlimited fast pass. We\u2019d get into these secret restaurants, stay in special lodging, etc with this vip fast pass stuff. Sounds fuckin rad right? Im by no means a Disney super-fan, but I would be stupid to not take that offer, right? I texted my bf to ask him and he said he didn\u2019t want to go. I wasn\u2019t surprised, and here\u2019s why. \n\nAbout 3 months ago, there was an event being thrown at my work. I brought Todd down for a little bit. He met everyone, and it seemed great. Let\u2019s call one of the owners \u201cStan\u201d. Stan was absolutely trashed. I had never seen him like that, but whatever. He\u2019s a professional guy, usually never saw him drunk, at all. They shook hands and Stan started telling Todd how great I am, and that he better treat me well, because I am quite the catch! I don\u2019t remember how the conversation veered off like this, but Stan said something about that he loves boobs. If he didn\u2019t like boobs he would be \u201cgay\u201d or something. Nothing about me or my boobs. But still juvenile and kinda weird, but typical drunk guy banter. Todd got a horrible first impression, and has been pissed that \u201cthat\u2019s who I work for\u201d ever since. I never asked Todd to come to anything work related again, knowing what he thinks of them.\n\nI brought it up again today while we were with my mom, and Todd had a meltdown. He went off about how he would never want to spend a minute with \u201cthose losers\u201d (we really wouldn\u2019t be spending much time with them, I was told we would be on our own and probably just get dinner all together), that he would never take a \u201chandout\u201d from Stan, and that he would rather be driving his sports car, and that he\u2019s almost 25, \u201cway too old for that shit\u201d. I was just taken aback. I understand that Stan made a horrible first impression, but I felt like that reaction was not warranted. I said \u201csorry if it offended you that Stan and (wife\u2019s name) offered to take us on a free trip to Disney. I won\u2019t bring it up again!\u201d \n\nHe told me that he was \u201cso angry he could scream\u201d, grabbed all his stuff and left. Haven\u2019t heard from him at all since. Now I\u2019m upset that I will miss out on this opportunity, because if I were to go, he would be furious. I understand where he\u2019s coming from, but I feel like he\u2019s overreacting.

Stan getting drunk and engaging in inappropriate behaviour towards you should be setting off your spidey sense. This may not be a side of him you've ever seen apart from that one night, but it is a side of him that exists and can come out unexpectedly during work functions. Sometimes, elaborate gifts/trips like this can have hidden strings. It's not unreasonable to be alert for anything that seems off, or to be suspicious of Stan's motives (your post isn't clear, but I assume the owners are the ones who invited you and are planning the trip?).\n\nTodd is expressing himself in completely the wrong way, making things worse rather than better, but his concerns are not totally unfounded.

If he genuinely did not feel threatened or concerned about Stan's behaviour towards OP, and simply found Stan to be unpleasant company, then he could politely refuse the invitation, rather than getting angry at OP and insulting her for wanting to go.

But OP comments that if she did go, she knows he\u2019d make her life miserable when she gets home. The intention there is clear: bf doesn\u2019t think she should go and he\u2019s going to throw a fit every time it\u2019s mentioned.", "Yeah because disney people are suckers", "I think it\u2019s funny. Boobs are awesome.", "Then we agree.\n\nHe is allowed to be angry after being pressured to do something he doesn't want to do.\n\nHer projection of how going to the trip will affect him should not be taken in consideration in her decision to go without him, she should decide for herself, and she clearly wants to go.\n\nFurthermore, the pressuring might have already convinced him that they are not compatible, as he already decided to remove himself from this situation.", "He said he'd be gay if he didn't like boobs. I don't get what is controversial or homophobic or sexist about that.", "I\u2019m not the word police so I won\u2019t be ticketing him for using \u201cgay\u201d. If that\u2019s your thing, that\u2019s swell, but it isn\u2019t mine.", "Being in a relationship doesn\u2019t make your problems mine. They\u2019re not married.", "Well that\u2019s cool.", "Pretty much. There's a belief that's still enduringly persistent that women (occasionally other genders) should accommodate the feelings of their partners, even if they don't think its reasonable. \n\nAnd that emotion is often used as a shorthand to signal displeasure without coming out and saying 'I forbid you'.\n\nSo I'm speaking to that tendency. He has his reasons, OP has hers, and she should not curtail her options because of his anger.", "No you're right, it's the legal documentation that makes you impacted by the feelings of the other person in a relationship. \n\nOP feels like it's enough of her problem to make a post on reddit looking for input."]}
