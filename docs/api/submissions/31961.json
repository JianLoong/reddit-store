Small town and only two dance studios. You need to own up to the fact that you have hurt her business and given her competitor a leg up. Your sister is NOT your mother and you didn't even give her a chance, or explain your concerns to her. The dance world is very small and can be toxic. As a former dancer, parents pull their students out for minimal things and studio hop all of the time. You better hope that the parents do not pull their children out and send them to a competitor or another studio out of town. Dance studios are also rumour mills. What a level of betrayal from you! Your sister didn't even do anything. Ballet classes at that age are 30-60 mins and they just run, skip, and hop to classical music. You made her look like she cannot be trusted with children, which is her business target! Who needs enemies when you have family members like this? \n\nShe had to call you up to clear the air when you messed up, find out from someone else about her sibling's foolishness, and explain her reasoning, and you shut her down by saying pure nonsense. You are more than a TA. I wish you explained your reasoning to her and told her for a trial we are thinking of sending her to a studio in the next town or even a community center class, and not going to her close competitor. You are lucky she has not looked at you differently and you better hope that she has a heart to support and be there for you if you ever need anything.", "YTA.\n\nYou absolutely should have called her and talked about it before the trial class. You know how the small-town gossip mill works and you should have thought about how your sister was going to feel when she heard about this.", "NTA, but I'd say give your sister a chance.  Your piano lessons with your mom were most likely private/1-on-1, beginner ballet classes for kids are in a group setting.\n\nUnless cost/distance/timing is an issue, I'd say give your sister's studio a shot.  Just because she starts classes at this school, doesn't mean she needs to stay there forever (if she chooses to continue). You can always keep an eye out and just be sure  that your daughter is always having fun.  This might create a beautiful bonding experience for the two of them.\n\nHowever, your sister using the \"my own family doesn't trust me card\" is indeed nonsense and not cool of her at all. \n\n(I took dance until I was 20 and loved it, taking classes with/from family would have been super cool.

I understand that your sister was hurt by having to find out through someone else and you should\u2019ve told her sooner, but in the end it doesn\u2019t even matter.

A piano is one-on-one. A ballet class is a large group of little kids having fun dancing together.

I totally understand why you wanted that separation. I personally feel it\u2019s always a good idea to keep those sorts of things separate for several reasons:\n1) if there is a problem, because she\u2019s your sister you may not feel comfortable bringing it up, and then the potential issue never gets solved, and your kid doesn\u2019t get as much out of it and you may start to feel some resentment. \n\n2) if there is a problem and you do bring it up it could cause unnecessarily conflict within your family. \n\nThe only place you went wrong is that you didn\u2019t tell your sister.

I live in a small village too and if I took into account how the rumour mill *might* take what I am doing and deciding, I wouldn't have another happy day in my life. \n\nAlso\u2026for pity's sake, it was a trial lesson.

Your daughter could end up enjoying ballet because her dear aunt is her teacher, and that can make her feel extra special compared to the other kids in the class, or even want to continue to make her aunt proud.\n\nYour daughter is 5. I think it\u2019s responsible on your part to allow her to explore different activities without any pressure to commit, so she can pursue what truly interests her.

In the end i think you made the right call by putting your child first.", "NTA\n\nBy sending her to a class separate from your sister, you gave your child the chance to make a decision on her own.

Plus, like you said, it was a trial. What if she decided she didn't want to, and then your sister gets pissy with you for not forcing her to stay?

I can see your point of view. I am a teacher and my mother was also a teacher. My mum taught me and although she treated me well it did cause some issues. If I was praised or chosen for something, there were always questions of favouritism. This occasionally meant I missed out on things I deserved and had earned so it didn\u2019t appear she was favouring me. \n\nMy sons now go to the school I teach at but I don\u2019t ever teach them because I don\u2019t want to create a conflict of interests. My most important role is as their mum and I don\u2019t ever want my job to interfere with that.\n\nExplain to your sister that her role as aunt could cause issues for her and your daughter if she teaches her as well. If your daughter is praised, other students may question if it\u2019s favouritism, if she has an issue with another child your sister could be put in a difficult situation to resolve it. If they do a performance your sister may have to make difficult choices assigning who does what. It\u2019s in your sister\u2019s best interests too to keep her roles of aunt and teacher separate as well.", "I would say NAH because it was just a trial class, and I think she is taking things a little personally. That being said, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect someone not to be upset at all for going to their competitor. You probably should have been prepared to deal with her reaction and explain your reasoning. \n\nI hope you planned to tell her eventually if your daughter decided to continue with dance. what I don\u2019t totally understand is your opposition to sending your daughter to her aunt\u2019s school if she was inspired to start dance by her aunt. Why not at least give it a chance?", "YTA", "NTA as it was a trial class and your daughter didn\u2019t continue. If you put her in a class in the competitors school for years, that would be different. Dance can be a big investment, so I totally get your reasoning. You don\u2019t want fork out a load of money on gear just for your daughter to say she was only going to make her Aunt happy and quit.", "YTA.  \nYou should have approached your sister, asked if your daughter could have a trial lesson, watched to see how it went and gone from there. If the issues you feared showed up you could then explain your concerns, and suggest looking at the other school as an option. All this might not even be necessary if your daughter decides it's not for her.  \n\n\nI'm not sure why you would feel the need to compare your sister to your mother. Even if she (undoubtedly) has similar characteristics the relationship between mother and daughter is very different to that of aunt and niece. I have nightmares over being tutored maths by my dad but I can go to my brother with no issues.  \n\n\nUnfortunately small towns love gossip and with only two schools it's inevitable questions would be asked. It should hopefully blow over but I think your sister is right, you could have at least flagged your daughter had an interest prior to the lesson. You are clearly close enough.", "YTA. The only time it's okay to go to a competitor is if you hate your sister or think she's a horrible coach.", "your sister runs a small business in a small town with one other competitor, & you didn\u2019t even *talk* to her before showing up at the competitor?  \nYTA. of course people talk about it, of course she found out, & of course she\u2019s upset.  \nyou can have whatever reasons you want, but don\u2019t be surprised when *dance moms* of all people are gossipy.", "YTA.

AITA here?\n\nIt's not. If your town is small enough for people to know that your daughter is taking classes at her rival's school instead of her school, people are going to make up a reason why and that's the one a lot of them will jump to.\n\nAlso... unless your sister is a primary caregiver for your child I don't think that you have reason to worry that the situation will at all be like your mother teaching you two piano, especially since she'll be teaching your daughter in a group setting.\n\nYTA. If you're not estranged from your sister then you *definitely* should have at least run this by her before signing your daughter up. If you really feel so strongly that your daughter should not be taught by her aunt then I think the best thing is to guide her into some other activity.

Or can you redirect your child into swimming, ice skating, gymnastics, drama, soccer...?", "Omg that's really cruel you did this. Your daughter would have loved to have this experience with her aunt.

You might have come to an agreement where you would still take your kid to the other class but that still needs to be a conversation with your sister", "YTA. You should\u2019ve called and set up a trial class with her. She is absolutely right that it affects her professional reputation that the 1st you do is to go to the competition. And it\u2019s an unfair supposition on your part to assume she wouldn\u2019t be professional. Arguably she had the same experience as you did with your mother, you could\u2019ve brought up that concern when you talked to her about the trial class.", "Sorry, YTA, mainly because of not being upfront with your sister before the fact. Given that it's a small town with only the two dance studios, the dance community in the town is almost certainly a pretty close-knit one, and you have inadvertantly compromised your sister's public image within that community, so she definitely did deserve at least an explanation before you went ahead rather than having to hear it from someone else. I understand your reasoning behind the choice, but you can't really be certain that she would be like your mother was when it comes to teaching family.", "Ask you child if she would like to take a trial ballet class with her aunt.

Your intentions were good! But as you said, there are only two ballet studios in town, and your sister was bound to hear about this and be hurt. The kinder (albeit more difficult) thing to do would have been to sit down with your sister, tell her what your mom\u2019s piano lessons were like for you, and relay your concerns. If you had that conversation with her, your sister might have either been aware enough of your concerns to avoid unconsciously treating your daughter differently than the other students.

Regardless of any experience with your mother or not, I ABSOLUTELY understand wanting to keep this separate from family relationship, but your sister absolutely deserved to be told, especially if it's a small town where gossip moves at lightning-speed.", "YTA you\u2019re punishing your sister for you mothers mistakes while simultaneously making her look bad in your small community.", "I totally get where you are coming from, but it would have been kinder to give your sister a heads up. \nLight YTA .\n\nLet your daughter do a trial class at your sisters school too and have her pick which one she likes best?", "NAH", "your concerns are valid when considering where to take her OP that\u2019s not the issue, the issue is you went to her competitor in a small town no less, without telling her. of course she\u2019s going to feel hurt that after all the time she\u2019s been trying to get you to put your daughter in her class, you just don\u2019t tell her anything and take her to a competitor! she\u2019s right people are judgemental and people will think that your sister isn\u2019t the go if she can\u2019t reach her own niece. \nagain it\u2019s not the issues that you have that are the problem, they can be talked out and resolved with your sister. it\u2019s the way you went about it. YTA sorry OP you need to try make this right with your sister", "YTA\n\nYou've created an imaginary scenario because of something that your mother did.\n\nYour Freudian slip is showing.", "NTA. She is your daughter and as a parent, you get to choose when and where she participates in any activity. Going to your sister's school does puts your daughter in a position where their relationship is different at dance as opposed to not dance time, which for some children can be difficult to navigate.\nAlso, if your daughter ended up continuing and was one of the better dancers your sister would always be at risk of the old favoutism allegations. \nPersonally for me, unless they would not be taught by the aunt, I would likely have chosen the same option. \n However yeah, look it might have been better to talk to her first to discuss.", "just to maybe help, i'd mention it might look almost equally as bad if the kid went to sisters trial class and immediately dropped anyways. kind of a lose/lose i guess, with the gossip. but yea id have talked to the sister", "And the way he\u2019s so dismissive of his sister\u2019s hurt feelings and perspective is an AH thing too. If he was worried about a repeat of his piano experience, he should have *talked to his sister.*", "Na, NTA. \n\nBetter not mix family and business.", "You knew the news would reach him.", "And it would have been hot gossip that OP didn't put his daughter in his sisters class", "This!\nYou are more than welcome to try out other classes and such, but YTA for not informing your sister beforehand.", "Fight fire with gasoline.", "It seems like there would be more pressure at his sisters class to keep doing ballet even if she hates it.", "the only reasonable comment, 100% agree with you", "There's been countless AITA posts about the bad outcomes when people mixed family and businesses, yeah. NTA", "Yes, the fact she confronted OP about this in the first place shows she's not able to handle disagreements between them about this topic. She's already showing that she's more concerned about her reputation than doing what's best for her niece.", "Why NTA?\n\nOpen communciation with sister about the issues would have covered the same scenario but without/barely any negative impact\n\nThere's 2 ways to go about this:\n\nIf the sister was informed beforehand and later questioned she can simply state: I like to keep family and business seperate, I want to be able to always be the fun aunt that shares a passion with her niece, not the strict aunt that teaches her niece. / My niece can always learn the best things from me, but having extra input to become better is never a bad thing, which is why she's going to another school to broaden her perspective.

So OP is definetly an AH for not talking first.", "The AH part wasn't about OP taking his daughter to another school, it's about not informing his sister about it.\n\nAt least by informing the sister about it, she can be more prepared when she heard about the news from elsewhere, and she can respond \"yea we want to keep our personal and professional lives separate so we agree that my niece should study ballet at another school\" instead of being blindsided from nowhere.", "Preach. Sure, it would have been nice of op to say beforehand \"hey I'm going to do *this*.\" But I honestly don't see the big deal of trying to avoid a situation where family is involved. \n\nI trained volleyball for years, first under a trainer, then partially my aunt then my mum. The experience is different because you as a relative are required to perform entirely differently and there's a constant pressure even in training sessions, to be the best you can be. \n\nSure, that's like, kind of the point, but it's also a socialising experience and that can easily get lost when you're supposed to professionally learn under a family member. \n\nPlus his reasoning of not letting the supposed interest get tainted by the presence of her aunt is solid.", "I agree with you 100%. My daughters participate in the sport that I did growing up and continue to do. I could teach them the basics, but I pay someone else to. Why? Because they listen to their coaches in a way that they don\u2019t listen to me.", "I\u2019m also thinking that if daughter turned out to be really good at dance and always ended up front and center for recitals that there would be lots of gossip/speculation that she only gets those spots because she\u2019s the teacher\u2019s niece. Dance moms can be brutal.", "Generational expectations can be intense. He wanted his daughter to experience what ballet was without any auntie influence.", "Seriously, such a fast convo. Even a text would be enough.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s interested in ballet. If I bring her for a trial lesson you\u2019re not gonna go crazy like mom used to, right? Lol\u201d", "An aunt is very different from a parent. YTA I\u2019m afraid.", "The way you handled it is what makes you AH here. Not wanting to do business with family members is a legit and normal response. True. But you dont give a heads up, and refusing to understand why it makes your sister upset is baffling. Seriously bro, what happened to common sense and communication?", ">without her experience being influenced by the comfort or discomfort of having the aunt she admires so much as a factor\n\nWhy?", "You want it to be without any family influence, yet you say her whole reason for wanting to dance is because of family influence.

Of course she's upset at that.", "NTA\nFamily will always cause issues. If your kid exells they will say its because she is the teachers niece. \"Oh she gets to be lead because is if family with one of the owners\" or \"she probably get extra lessons for free\" etc. \n\nParents suck when it come to sports. \n\nJust say \"I find its best for mmy daugther to be at an independant school, so they are neutral in their teaching of her\"", "Do you think that OP's mother would have admitted beforehand that she wouldn't be a good piano teacher for OP? \n\nThis really isn't something that you can just ask and expect an accurate answer.", "I confirm. My niece love to come at my place, because since I'm not the full time parent, I love playing with her (knowing I will sleep unbothered after I take her home). She has an activity box, a piano and a slide at my place, and I painted a wall with a special paint to make it a chalkboard, so she can draw on the walls. \n\nThat's being an aunt, it's funnier than with mom. Daughter could take ballet as a fun time with her auntie, even though she doesn't take it seriously, at least she does sport and enjoy it at the same time. At this age, sport is just a game, not a competition, not a job", "I actually think it's smart to take the kid somewhere else.\n\nI believe it's a young kid (5??) and they should be able to decide what they want to do for themselves. Kid heard ballet and wanted to try. If you let the kid go to the aunt, they might be scared to disappoint their aunt and continue dancing while not enjoying it. Taking her somewhere else gives the kid an opportunity to experience ballet without familial pressure to continue.", "Okay you're being obtuse. OP has stated multiple times they're more concerned about their child having a *negative* experience because of familial pressure, which is an extremely fair and valid point of view.\n\n\nThis thread feels like people are ignoring that extremely crucial part.", "That is exactly why its important for her to go to a different dance class. She needs to be able to experience dancing in a way that she can decide for herself whether she enjoys it or not, without family influence.", "So what if there is a difference? It's an issue that she thinks she needs to be involved in the how and why just because she knows something about ballet despite not being the child's parent or having any idea what's best for her. \n\nThe entire issue is that anyone sees this as being about ballet/the sister's reputation when it was actually about OP doing what's best for the child.\n\n\nI don't really care what the rumor mill has to say, that's got nothing to do with OP. If they want to gossip about the sister, they're gonna find something to gossip about regardless of OP's actions. I will tell you from experience, you can literally sit in your house alone all day trying to avoid them and they will still find something to say.", "My husband\u2019s ex does local theater. She gets their daughter a part for every play. This has been going on for years. His daughter is starting to notice. She even made a comment about how it\u2019s weird she doesn\u2019t have to audition like all the other kids and how some of her friends are upset about her always getting parts. \n\nWhat\u2019s even worse is her mom doesn\u2019t want her daughter \u201cupstaging\u201d her so daughter is only given crappy parts like a tree or puppy #3. Her mom only does plays where she herself is the lead and has said she doesn\u2019t want their daughter being in kid lead roles because she doesn\u2019t want competition in the family and theater is HER thing. Even in a play she wrote and directed, she gave her daughter the most insignificant role. So I guess it\u2019s only partial nepotism, lol\u2026", "Literally in the above comment OP clearly states the want to avoid a negative OR positive experience with family, but ok, I\u2019m ignoring things.", "I wouldn\u2019t say she needs to, but obviously there\u2019s no harm in it. Though I do think familial influence can\u2019t be completely avoided.", "Sounds like daughter is just set dressing.", ">avoid a negative OR positive\n\nDoesn't matter about the potential positives because OP has decided that any negatives outweigh any positives in regards to HIS child.\n\n\nNTA.

Seems more like she\u2019s letting her own past experiences affect her decisions in regards to her daughter, regardless of what\u2019s actually best.", "OP is a guy. You're trying to argue his intentions but didn't even read enough of his comments to know that. I've literally only read 2 of his comments and got that HE wanted to avoid negative AND positive influences from family. Which is ridiculous because the whole reason his daughter wanted to try ballet was because of his sister, so family influence.", "Which used to be called \"taking what you've experienced and applying it to raising your kids\". Weird, right?\n\n\nOP has done nothing wrong except hurt his sister's small town ego. He wanted his child to experience ballet free of familial pressure ad expectations and got that. That is NOT asshole behaviour no matter which way you try to swing it.", "Sorry. It was initially 2am when I woke up and read it. OP is indeed a dude. It's not even the comments, it's right there in the post. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe", "Except there\u2019s no indication there would be any familial pressure at all. OP just assumes there would be, even though the sister had the same negative experience OP did. Not saying it\u2019s AH behaviour, but it\u2019s more complex than just \u201cOP is just protecting their child\u201d.", "We don't know that, because we aren't around. We have no idea what the sister is like, and personally from her even entertaining the gossip and nonsense so strongly that she called OP... I think OP made the right decision. Regardless of the best intentions, whenever family is involved, there is often an expectation. \"It runs in the family\" type of nonsense. If a kid shows a talent for something that someone else in the family shares, it can put tremendous amounts of pressure on the child. Even more so if the child shows talent but *doesn't like the event*. \n\n\nWe have ALL seen this. You see it at every child's sporting event everywhere on this planet. \n\n\nSo I focused on what mattered to OP and what matters is his kid, not his sisters studio. So, NTA."]}
