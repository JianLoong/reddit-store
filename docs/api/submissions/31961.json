Small town and only two dance studios. You need to own up to the fact that you have hurt her business and given her competitor a leg up. Your sister is NOT your mother and you didn't even give her a chance, or explain your concerns to her. The dance world is very small and can be toxic. As a former dancer, parents pull their students out for minimal things and studio hop all of the time. You better hope that the parents do not pull their children out and send them to a competitor or another studio out of town. Dance studios are also rumour mills. What a level of betrayal from you! Your sister didn't even do anything. Ballet classes at that age are 30-60 mins and they just run, skip, and hop to classical music. You made her look like she cannot be trusted with children, which is her business target! Who needs enemies when you have family members like this? \n\nShe had to call you up to clear the air when you messed up, find out from someone else about her sibling's foolishness, and explain her reasoning, and you shut her down by saying pure nonsense. You are more than a TA. I wish you explained your reasoning to her and told her for a trial we are thinking of sending her to a studio in the next town or even a community center class, and not going to her close competitor. You are lucky she has not looked at you differently and you better hope that she has a heart to support and be there for you if you ever need anything.", "YTA.\n\nYou absolutely should have called her and talked about it before the trial class. You know how the small-town gossip mill works and you should have thought about how your sister was going to feel when she heard about this.", "NTA, but I'd say give your sister a chance.  Your piano lessons with your mom were most likely private/1-on-1, beginner ballet classes for kids are in a group setting.\n\nUnless cost/distance/timing is an issue, I'd say give your sister's studio a shot.  Just because she starts classes at this school, doesn't mean she needs to stay there forever (if she chooses to continue). You can always keep an eye out and just be sure  that your daughter is always having fun.  This might create a beautiful bonding experience for the two of them.\n\nHowever, your sister using the \"my own family doesn't trust me card\" is indeed nonsense and not cool of her at all. \n\n(I took dance until I was 20 and loved it, taking classes with/from family would have been super cool.

I understand that your sister was hurt by having to find out through someone else and you should\u2019ve told her sooner, but in the end it doesn\u2019t even matter.

A piano is one-on-one. A ballet class is a large group of little kids having fun dancing together.

I totally understand why you wanted that separation. I personally feel it\u2019s always a good idea to keep those sorts of things separate for several reasons:\n1) if there is a problem, because she\u2019s your sister you may not feel comfortable bringing it up, and then the potential issue never gets solved, and your kid doesn\u2019t get as much out of it and you may start to feel some resentment. \n\n2) if there is a problem and you do bring it up it could cause unnecessarily conflict within your family. \n\nThe only place you went wrong is that you didn\u2019t tell your sister.

I live in a small village too and if I took into account how the rumour mill *might* take what I am doing and deciding, I wouldn't have another happy day in my life. \n\nAlso\u2026for pity's sake, it was a trial lesson.

Your daughter could end up enjoying ballet because her dear aunt is her teacher, and that can make her feel extra special compared to the other kids in the class, or even want to continue to make her aunt proud.\n\nYour daughter is 5. I think it\u2019s responsible on your part to allow her to explore different activities without any pressure to commit, so she can pursue what truly interests her.

In the end i think you made the right call by putting your child first.", "NTA\n\nBy sending her to a class separate from your sister, you gave your child the chance to make a decision on her own.

Plus, like you said, it was a trial. What if she decided she didn't want to, and then your sister gets pissy with you for not forcing her to stay?

I can see your point of view. I am a teacher and my mother was also a teacher. My mum taught me and although she treated me well it did cause some issues. If I was praised or chosen for something, there were always questions of favouritism. This occasionally meant I missed out on things I deserved and had earned so it didn\u2019t appear she was favouring me. \n\nMy sons now go to the school I teach at but I don\u2019t ever teach them because I don\u2019t want to create a conflict of interests. My most important role is as their mum and I don\u2019t ever want my job to interfere with that.\n\nExplain to your sister that her role as aunt could cause issues for her and your daughter if she teaches her as well. If your daughter is praised, other students may question if it\u2019s favouritism, if she has an issue with another child your sister could be put in a difficult situation to resolve it. If they do a performance your sister may have to make difficult choices assigning who does what. It\u2019s in your sister\u2019s best interests too to keep her roles of aunt and teacher separate as well.", "I would say NAH because it was just a trial class, and I think she is taking things a little personally. That being said, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect someone not to be upset at all for going to their competitor. You probably should have been prepared to deal with her reaction and explain your reasoning. \n\nI hope you planned to tell her eventually if your daughter decided to continue with dance. what I don\u2019t totally understand is your opposition to sending your daughter to her aunt\u2019s school if she was inspired to start dance by her aunt. Why not at least give it a chance?", "YTA", "NTA as it was a trial class and your daughter didn\u2019t continue. If you put her in a class in the competitors school for years, that would be different. Dance can be a big investment, so I totally get your reasoning. You don\u2019t want fork out a load of money on gear just for your daughter to say she was only going to make her Aunt happy and quit.", "YTA.  \nYou should have approached your sister, asked if your daughter could have a trial lesson, watched to see how it went and gone from there. If the issues you feared showed up you could then explain your concerns, and suggest looking at the other school as an option. All this might not even be necessary if your daughter decides it's not for her.  \n\n\nI'm not sure why you would feel the need to compare your sister to your mother. Even if she (undoubtedly) has similar characteristics the relationship between mother and daughter is very different to that of aunt and niece. I have nightmares over being tutored maths by my dad but I can go to my brother with no issues.  \n\n\nUnfortunately small towns love gossip and with only two schools it's inevitable questions would be asked. It should hopefully blow over but I think your sister is right, you could have at least flagged your daughter had an interest prior to the lesson. You are clearly close enough.", "YTA. The only time it's okay to go to a competitor is if you hate your sister or think she's a horrible coach.", "your sister runs a small business in a small town with one other competitor, & you didn\u2019t even *talk* to her before showing up at the competitor?  \nYTA. of course people talk about it, of course she found out, & of course she\u2019s upset.  \nyou can have whatever reasons you want, but don\u2019t be surprised when *dance moms* of all people are gossipy.", "YTA.

AITA here?\n\nIt's not. If your town is small enough for people to know that your daughter is taking classes at her rival's school instead of her school, people are going to make up a reason why and that's the one a lot of them will jump to.\n\nAlso... unless your sister is a primary caregiver for your child I don't think that you have reason to worry that the situation will at all be like your mother teaching you two piano, especially since she'll be teaching your daughter in a group setting.\n\nYTA. If you're not estranged from your sister then you *definitely* should have at least run this by her before signing your daughter up. If you really feel so strongly that your daughter should not be taught by her aunt then I think the best thing is to guide her into some other activity.

Or can you redirect your child into swimming, ice skating, gymnastics, drama, soccer...?", "Omg that's really cruel you did this. Your daughter would have loved to have this experience with her aunt.

You might have come to an agreement where you would still take your kid to the other class but that still needs to be a conversation with your sister", "YTA. You should\u2019ve called and set up a trial class with her. She is absolutely right that it affects her professional reputation that the 1st you do is to go to the competition. And it\u2019s an unfair supposition on your part to assume she wouldn\u2019t be professional. Arguably she had the same experience as you did with your mother, you could\u2019ve brought up that concern when you talked to her about the trial class.", "Sorry, YTA, mainly because of not being upfront with your sister before the fact. Given that it's a small town with only the two dance studios, the dance community in the town is almost certainly a pretty close-knit one, and you have inadvertantly compromised your sister's public image within that community, so she definitely did deserve at least an explanation before you went ahead rather than having to hear it from someone else. I understand your reasoning behind the choice, but you can't really be certain that she would be like your mother was when it comes to teaching family.", "Ask you child if she would like to take a trial ballet class with her aunt.

Your intentions were good! But as you said, there are only two ballet studios in town, and your sister was bound to hear about this and be hurt. The kinder (albeit more difficult) thing to do would have been to sit down with your sister, tell her what your mom\u2019s piano lessons were like for you, and relay your concerns.

Especially seeing as how she\u2019s the one who has inspired your daughter \u2026 NAH.", "Why does their sister need to know what they\u2019re doing with their daughter? Do they also need to consult their sister every time their daughter goes to the bathroom? They aren\u2019t obligated to involve their sister just bc she teaches ballet.", "People may laugh but I was in the competitive dance scene for about 17 years. Not only is this believable but it's actually probable.", "I can't believe so many people are saying OP is TA. If the sister was hurt by not being kept in the loop, one can apologize for the hurt feelings, but I don't think it's something he *should have known* his sister would want to know about. It's a simple mistake that it didn't occur to him to get in front of things. But when all this other stuff gets tacked on implying that there's a social obligation to use family, I'm inclined to spit back that kind of BS is exactly why I don't want you involved with my daughter's hobbies. If the mere decision to try out an unrelated teacher one time gets this level of drama, imagine the consequences when the daughter isn't good at ballet or wants to quit or anything else that could be construed as reflecting on the family teacher.", "Eh, not really. Pretty easy to say that the kid just wasn't interested in dance after trying it out. It happens all the time. Very common for the idea of dancing to be exciting but the actual structure of learning to dance technically be not for someone.", "Plus an aunt is way different than a mother. Totally different relationship.", "If OP gives their sister a heads up, their sister is ready to answer any gossip with a, \"Yeah, we agreed that it was better not to mix the aunt and teacher roles.\"\n\nWithout giving their sister a heads up, there's risk that their sister is blindsided by gossip and doesn't have an answer ready, because she can't know that the reason isn't personal.", "It would also be hot gossip that she did though, that's what people are forgetting. Especially if the kid continues to do ballet. Any concert roles the kid gets isn't because of her own talent, but nepotism, if she gets to pointe before any other kid, it's because her aunt favoured her. My partner is a ballet teacher and the owner has two kids through the academy and the favouritism, intentional or not, is is still talked about by the mums even though neither kid is there anymore.", "The only way this is at all comparable is if pooping is a sport or leisure activity, there are only two toilets in town available for hire and the sister owns one of them, and the daughter is primarily interested in pooping *because* of the sister\u2019s positive poopy influence.", "I highly doubt in a place where there is only two schools that all(or even the majority) of kids are good. It is a bad look when your family doesn't want to come to your studio. Not to say OP couldn't make that choice, but it doesn't change the optics for the sister.", ">this level of drama\n\nI\u2019m curious what soap opera you\u2019ve concocted in your head based on the three sentences OP wrote describing her sisters reaction which include and are limited to:\n\n1. Being hurt.\n\n2. Asking to be called first so she didn\u2019t hear it from someone else.\n\n3. Pointing out that it could be interpreted poorly by others in a small town.\n\nOh my god so much drama!", "what, are they twelve years old? why does the sister need to be informed that they aren\u2019t going to do lessons with her? unless it was a pre planned thing and OP cancelled on sister last minute, why is this some sort of betrayal?", "while i agree and find the notion ridiculous, small towns, gossip circles are akin to the girl scout circle phonemom.", "There are literally only two options.\nHis only option to not mix business and family, according to you, is to just not let his daughter do what she desires.", "I've been teaching dance for somethingl like 20 years, and it's incredibly common. Much less common for someone to go to a different studio when their family owns one. It would definitely be seen in a more critical light that someone just not liking dance.", "> I do not feel like OP is the AH for not wanting to mix family and business. And I also don\u2019t think he\u2019s the AH for not giving a heads up either.\n\nI feel your first sentence may be correct, but I disagree with your second sentence. OP might be *technically* correct but they\u2019re still an AH for letting their sister find out from others. The \u2018other\u2019 teacher is absolutely going to dine out on how the sister is so bad her own family don\u2019t trust her to teach their kids.", "Most small towns have a nearby town or two, plus classes through a school program or private tutor would not hit the same as sneaking to his sister's main competition behind her back.", "I'm just gonna point out that the sister was very unprofessional about her reaction.  \n\nIf you don't like how a potential customer goes about their business, you 'shrug' and keep any opinion to yourself.  It's the CUSTOMER'S choice, regardless of whether they are family or not.", "Because open and honest communication with people you purport to care about matters.\n\nIf you care about someone, and you have information that affects them, you tell them directly instead of waiting for them to find out some other way. Unless you're an asshole, that is.", "But the OP did. They absolutely made this a family matter, even if you can\u2019t or won\u2019t understand why.", "No you're the one who doesn't understand. \n\nJust because a family member has a business, it doesn't mean every single transaction another family member makes in that field becomes a \"family\" matter.", "I understand perfectly well what you\u2019re saying, I just disagree with you. Let me know if you need further help with understanding that.", "Do you watch football ON YOUR OWN, or do you only watch football when Your dad is around? You are proving my point for me.", "I do it on my own now as a 32 year old, but when I was 5 I watched it with my dad, you know like a normal kid who wants to do things with people they look up to. I\u2019m not sure you know what \u201cprove\u201d means because this is an explicit counter to your point lmao. If my dad didn\u2019t watch football with me there\u2019s a chance I never would\u2019ve gotten into it, but I\u2019m glad I did. What you and OP are suggesting is depriving his daughter of this opportunity to learn to love something with someone she looks up to because without that someone, she might not otherwise pick it up on her own volition, which is such a bizarre take."]}
