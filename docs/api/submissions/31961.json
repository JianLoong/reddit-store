I know shit about the marriages of coaches in leagues and sports my kid isn't even in. I don't want to know any of this crap, but all parents do at practice drop off and pick up is gossip whether you want to hear it or not. \n\nIf you're in a town so small that your sister immediately heard your daughter was in the other's school's class, you can be quite certain that you live in a rumor mill that will affect your sister's business if your girl goes to the other school. \n\nNot to say that you should put her in one school or the other, that's up to you and her.

Small town and only two dance studios. You need to own up to the fact that you have hurt her business and given her competitor a leg up. Your sister is NOT your mother and you didn't even give her a chance, or explain your concerns to her. The dance world is very small and can be toxic. As a former dancer, parents pull their students out for minimal things and studio hop all of the time. You better hope that the parents do not pull their children out and send them to a competitor or another studio out of town. Dance studios are also rumour mills. What a level of betrayal from you! Your sister didn't even do anything. Ballet classes at that age are 30-60 mins and they just run, skip, and hop to classical music. You made her look like she cannot be trusted with children, which is her business target! Who needs enemies when you have family members like this? \n\nShe had to call you up to clear the air when you messed up, find out from someone else about her sibling's foolishness, and explain her reasoning, and you shut her down by saying pure nonsense. You are more than a TA. You are lucky she has not looked at you differently and you better hope that she has a heart to support and be there for you if you ever need anything.", "YTA.\n\nYou absolutely should have called her and talked about it before the trial class. You know how the small-town gossip mill works and you should have thought about how your sister was going to feel when she heard about this.", "NTA, but I'd say give your sister a chance.  Your piano lessons with your mom were most likely private/1-on-1, beginner ballet classes for kids are in a group setting.\n\nUnless cost/distance/timing is an issue, I'd say give your sister's studio a shot.  Just because she starts classes at this school, doesn't mean she needs to stay there forever (if she chooses to continue). You can always keep an eye out and just be sure  that your daughter is always having fun.  This might create a beautiful bonding experience for the two of them.\n\nHowever, your sister using the \"my own family doesn't trust me card\" is indeed nonsense and not cool of her at all. \n\n(I took dance until I was 20 and loved it, taking classes with/from family would have been super cool.  Just make sure she's always having fun.)\n\nEdit: missing words", "To be honest, people like you kill that feeling that I wish I had a sister. I\u2019m honestly glad I had 3 brothers because this is petty garbage from your mother that you\u2019re taking out on your sister.", "Ohhhhh YTA and ya fuxked up. Grovel, and loudly tell others about how and why you screwed up. Because if it hit the rumor mill you absolutely injured her business.", "NTA. Your reasoning makes a lot of sense and you\u2019ve explained in the comments that you would\u2019ve told your sister if your daughter had been interested in continuing. I understand that your sister was hurt by having to find out through someone else and you should\u2019ve told her sooner, but in the end it doesn\u2019t even matter. It was a trial class that ended in disinterest for your daughter, people likely would\u2019ve gossiped just as much as they are in this case if you stopped going to your sister after one class.", "NTA. No rule book says she must go to her sister's business first before she tries anyone else.  \n\nI'm guessing the YTA's are calling you out for not trusting your sister because of your mother.  People have too much time on their hands.  \ud83e\udd37", "YTA. Sister is right that she shouldn\u2019t have had to find out from other people and that you undermined her in others\u2019 eyes by taking your daughter to the competitor. Ultimately the choice is yours as to who you want to teach your daughter, but you should have left your sister know first.", "YTA. A ballet class is so different to piano lessons. A piano is one-on-one. A ballet class is a large group of little kids having fun dancing together. What you did was undermine your sister\u2019s business, all without giving her an opportunity to address any of your concerns. Your daughter probably would have felt extra special because her aunt was the teacher. While you may have not intended to create damage, you have and your sister\u2019s reputation will suffer because you didn\u2019t communicate with her.", "She's one of the owners, and all of the partners are also teachers, but they cover different age groups and dance styles. All ballet classes to children in my daughter's age group are taught by my sister.\n\nEdit: she does have an assistant with her that's a paid employee.", ">Did your sister anything that make you think she is like your mother?\n\nShe did not. I admit I could be making unfair assumptions based on my experience here. However, I also wanted my daughter to get a sense of what taking ballet would be like, without her experience being influenced by the comfort or discomfort of having the aunt she admires so much as a factor.\n\n>Why didnt you tell her about that?\n\nIf my daughter decided to go on with ballet, I would tell her then. And even consider taking her to her school after expressing my worries to my sister.\n\n>If this is a small town, of course everyone will think that even her own sister dont want she teaches her daughter.\n\nQuick correction, I'm actually her brother.", "As I said in another comment, it's not that I think my sister will act the same way our mother did, it's just that I wanted my daughter's experience to be all about how much she enjoyed ballet without the positive/negative influence of having a family member involved. I didn't consider how the image of her business could be impacted by this. I deeply regret that this could be an issue, but it wasn't my intention. What I regret the most though is not talking to her from the beginning to explain my reasons.", "I'm her brother.", "NTA\n\nWhere you choose to have your daughter go is your choice. Your daughter can always switch schools when she is older and in another age group.\n\nIf people ask, you can just tell a white lie and say it was a time or cost thing. Or you let your daughter pick and she wanted to go to the other school because her friend was there."]}
