She also mentioned that was down to her last pad when she changed after the spill. \n\nI recently splurged to buy $500 linen sheets, which are white.  Getting ready for bed, she was wearing the new pad, along with a pair of my boxer briefs. I asked her calmly and respectfully if she\u2019d also wear a pair of sweatpants to bed, to minimize the chances of my sheets being ruined if there was another leak.  She said that it would be fine, but I thought the recent stain on my couch suggested otherwise.  I asked again several times, explaining that I really didn\u2019t want my sheets to be ruined. I made sure to do so calmly and respectfully again. She still blew me off.\n\nAfter this, I\u2019m annoyed, and I go to change the linen sheets to old cheaper ones so I can avoid a potential stain on the expensive ones. She asks what I\u2019m doing, and I told her why I was and changing the sheets and that I was annoyed with her for not respecting my things. I didn\u2019t raise my voice/call names or anything like that, but it was clear I was annoyed. \n\nShe immediately got mad and told me she was going home (about 10 min away).

My spouse who has hemorrhoid leaks, wears sweatshorts and also tucks a towel over the sheets to lie on on those occasions so he doesn't mess up my super expensive tempurpedic sheets.  This is NOT about rejecting a normal body function, it is about disregarding your request to not mess up an expensive item when it is easy as changing the sheets.  It is very discourteous of her and she should have volunteered and helped change the sheets.  Especially when she had already bled on your couch.  There are also washable leakproof pads that can be put on chairs and beds if someone bleeds heavily enough.  It is not shameful at all that it happens, just shameful when she refuses to acknowledge and help do something about it.", "NTA. Changing the sheets is practical. Get dark sheets.

Unless she wants to replace the sheets she can adopt a more cautious pyjama routine.", "NTA. Periods are normal and can get messy - there are additional precautions we can take to minimize leaking all over everything. Accidents happen, but if one has already happened, she should make an effort to prevent another. Sheets wash, but blood can stain. I wouldn't want a blood stain on my $500 white sheets either. This same reason is also why when we are on our periods, we wear specific \"period\" panties or dark panties.", "NTA Was it impractical to go out? It sounds like the pads she had weren't the right size or thickness for her current flow. Also boxers don't hug the body well enough for a pad to work well.

My wife has some really heavy periods. She has bled all over almost everything.  Sometimes it so heavy that I will find a drop on the kitchen floor tiles. This doesn't make me tell her to change her routine but to talk about it to find a solution. Aside from putting her in skin tight rubber pants, it's unavoidable and sweat pants isn't going to prevent bleed through. During those days, we have a small pee pad that we used to use for our kids and now when hits those days, she tucks it under the sheet just in case. If she bleeds on the sheet, she takes it out and runs it under hot water until the stain is mostly gone and then treats it with pre-wash. Simple and easy to do. Never even with white sheets have we had a stain stick unless we missed checking it before throwing it into dryer.", "I see no problem asking her. I have my daughter sit in her blanket on the side when she is menstruating for the same reason, it\u2019s easier to wash the blanket if there\u2019s an accident. I do the same thing for myself because I have had these accidents before. She just might be embarrassed.\nNext time, maybe have her sit on an old towel or blanket just in case, but you\u2019re not in the wrong.", "NTA; as a woman I would have made a similar suggestion. Accidents happen.

She already bled through once which was delt with so it\u2019s entirely valid to bleed through again. I\u2019d just have put on sweats. As a coochie owner I\u2019ve bled through in my sleep countless times and peroxide is my friend lol.", "Definitely NTA. Anyone even alluding to you being an asshole is crazy. I am a woman & no it is not uncomfortable to wear pants to bed whilst you have your period lol. It is gross to bleed all over someone else\u2019s things & they would not even have to ask me in the first place to put on extra layers.", "If she went through a pad in under an hour, she should look into fibroids. Most women will have them before 50 and they can be quite serious.", "She has bled thru pad and did not clean couch? She has one pad left? So many ???. As a woman who always had heavy bleeding there is no excuse for not being prepared. It is not just the sheets, mattress... comforter.. OP himself, ...... It is also the bedroom flooring and bathroom flooring, rugs etc.  And menstrual blood is different than say a bloody nose. It saturates quicker and has a smell.   The negative comments about body fluids and sex... y'all be inexperienced....  My cycles produced more \"fluids\" than any sex act. I had blood clots the size of my fists at times. \nPutting on sweats does help contain the fluid more than panties or boxers.  If comfort was a question, why was she not prepared?", "NTA.\n\nYou had reachable standards, she didn't want to respect them.", "NTA. I have lady parts and yes accidents happen, but 1.she didn't even clean off the couch herself 2.SHE KNOWS ACCIDENTS HAPPEN. So why would she be ok to risk YOUR STUFF again? I understand why you would want to change the sheets to the cheaper kind. It's like walking on a mine field for men to try to address periods, but I completely think you're NTA here.", "NTA", "NTA but weird that she doesn't keep emergency fem items in her purse or in her car. Also, now that you know roughly when her period is due, swap to some dark sheets and make sure you have a waterproof mattress cover on. Accidents will eventually happen, but at least this way they won't be as bad.", "NTA. That's a totally fair request and honestly, if I were her, I would have brought up changing the sheets myself, just to be safe.", "NTA. As a woman, I wouldn\u2019t even use the good sheets for my own bed when I\u2019m on my period, let alone get offended at someone else\u2019s house. It\u2019s an absolute pain to get the stains out, and sometimes they don\u2019t come out at all. And I hope you have a mattress protector because sometimes the stain can leak through onto the mattress. Gf should\u2019ve known better to suggest laying down a towel or old shirt if she didn\u2019t want to wear pants.", "As a female - NTA, weird that you had to ask her in the first place.", "NTA- I deal with periods like this and am mortified when it leaks. When it\u2019s heavy- leggings under dresses, pajama bottoms with the biggest pad you\u2019ve ever seen in your life and a towel laid down for sleeping. \n\nIt\u2019s a no brainer. Why does she want to take the chance of ruining your sheets? Also I hope she cleaned up the couch.", "NTA she\u2019s overreacting and should\u2019ve just changed. You were already nice enough to change your sheets. She needs a reality check. It isn\u2019t an attack on her if you ask her to respect your things", "NAH. From your perspective, you are just looking out for a new and expensive purchase. From her perspective, she was being asked to do something unwanted because of something natural that she could not control. Maybe it was hot, maybe she has cramps and the sweatpants are uncomfortable. I think that preemptively changing the sheets next time she is staying and in her period is the best way to go. Accidents do happen.", "nah ur in the right", "NTA\n\nI have \"period sheets\" for myself. That was a good compromise from you and she shouldn't be pissed about it. You cleaning the sofa shows, that you are not grossed out by periods, but just didn't want to get your $500 sheets bloody.\n\nI would suggest to try talk this out with her. Maybe she just thought, you meant it in a bad way. I had a lot of pain, when on my period, when i were younger and i can understand her not wanting to wear clothes that may be uncomfortale to her. Just talk about it and try being understanding (i think you were great so far).\n\nTo avoid this in the future, you can get pads for your at your apartment, so she wont ran out of them. Wash bloody things with cold water and soap first and a second time normal. Blood stains will leave yellowish stains when washed too hot (Because of the protein in the blood coagulating, if i remember it correctly) And if she gets on board with your reasoning, you can GENTLY suggest getting waterproof linen, so your matress wouldn't get messy either. But don't call it pee pad! haha\n\nNAH", "NTA  If she was flowing that heavy she should have gone home the minute she realized she was on her last pad. She should have cleaned the couch. Doesn't sound like she respects your things thereby not respecting you.", "I would go with NTA. \n\n>I cleaned it off my sofa, no big deal, accidents happen. \n\nFrom your action, I presume you're an considerate man. \n\n>I asked her calmly and respectfully if she\u2019d also wear a pair of sweatpants to bed, to minimize the chances of my sheets being ruined if there was another leak.   \n>  \n>I made sure to do so calmly and respectfully again.\n\nYou politely & respectfully asked your gf if she can be able to fulfill your request. Put on a sweatpants was also not an impossible thing to do. \n\nAs a woman, I think it is common sense to avoid period spilling, especially on others' people stuffs. Although period is absolutely a normal thing for women, but that doesn't mean you can freely, lying down on people's bed, knowing there's a high risk of leaking (Based on the fact that \"She was having a particularly heavy day, so much so that a significant amount of blood spilled on my sofa\") , and not taking any preventive action when possible. \n\nHowever, I would say OP can be more considerate when explaining the situation & changing the sheet, rather than being passive aggressive as your GF might be more sensitive during her period, and she would be hurt by your reaction.", "NAH.\n\nIf she's going through a pad every HOUR that's a medical issue. Enough so that she probably didn't predict running out of pads (that's not a regular flow) and she was probably feeling lousy and not wanting things touching her tummy. If you were in the UK I would recommend a medical check in for flow that heavy (Currently getting help fir similar myself) but I suspect you're in the US so it's difficult.\n\nYou're not unreasonable for wanting to save your sheets. She's not unreasonable for not wanting to wear extra stuff if her stomach felt lousy. Old sheets would be a good call anyway when that heavy. Talk to her today when calmer about doctor checkins", "NTA \n\nYou don't want to ruin something expensive that you bought, but toothpaste works wonders in helping it not stain things or stain as badly. (Its what I use personally this to help get it out of my expensive undies when I get it unexpectedly.)\n\nIt also sounds like your partner got embarrassed about the blood and overreacted a bit. So only minor AH", "In those cases, I put an old bath towel under my butt,  and tuck a side under the matrass. I fully get you not wanting to ruin sheets (though if accident, soap and cold water on the spots then cold wash), but pants in bede are not comfy.\nNAH", "Assuming there isn\u2019t some hidden misogyny in your story, here\u2019s a crazy idea\u2026tampons. Who tf still wears pads? They\u2019re uncomfortable and MESSY. If she\u2019s concerned about toxic shock then tell her to try out a period cup - I suggest the *Flex Cup.* It holds the equivalent of 2 super tampons and doesn\u2019t leak. It\u2019s kind of gross to \u201cchange\u201d but whatever, so is bleeding all over everything for the better part of a week.\n\nAs for being an asshole, I don\u2019t think there are any assholes here - again assuming you\u2019ve reported the situation as it actually happened. I don\u2019t *love* the \u201ccan you wear pants\u201d comment, but in the situation, I get it. You don\u2019t want your stuff ruined and she is very likely self-conscious, because women are trained to believe periods are shameful rather than a normal bodily function, which is my guess as to her reaction to you saying something about it.\n\nThis should be an easy fix - hell, but her some organic tampons (there are reasons for the organic but just trust me) AND Flex Cup, then she can choose. (The cup is WAY cheaper in the long run FYI).

Biology is messy and even the possibility - after potentially making her self uncomfortable and self conscious - of something happening which would set you off would make me not want to be there.", "NAH I don\u2019t think you were wrong to ask and change from the expensive sheets to the cheaper ones.

I think using less expensive and darker colored sheets when she\u2019s on her period is a good step. Maybe she should also consider wearing period shorts like Thinx in addition to a pad if she is bleeding that much. Also, while I don\u2019t know if saying anything is right, it doesn\u2019t seem normal to bleed through a pad in only an hour unless she was using a really thin pad, if she\u2019s consistently having super heavy periods that might be something to bring up to her gyno", "Just to add a bit of perspective.

But if it\u2019s never happened before, and it\u2019s not normal for flow ya both AH to her. One reason it\u2019s hard as hell to know enough about how bad periods should be, is because people just shrug and go on.

So it might as well really could have been ok.", "YTA there's such a thing as a washing machine.  Blood will not ruin your sheets.

It helps keep everything in place so my pad doesn\u2019t shift  while I\u2019m sleeping and I like the feeling of it hugging my abdomen as the ones I have aren\u2019t uncomfortably tight.", "Pants have waistbands, which fit over waists that are bloated and full of gas and weird poops. At least, that\u2019s my periods.", "(Think about how most dying techniques need nigh temperatures to set the dye)", "Exactly. Cold water for blood stains. Hot water makes them permanent. After hot water, you can't remove them anymore.", "not boiling hot water just hot tap water. it for some reason pulls it out with a little soap while cold water just pushed it to the outside. I was guessing because the fibers loosened up with the warmer water. Not an expert but just know what I have done with the direction of my wife.", "I was just thinking the same, blood should be rinsed out with cold water.", "Full agreed and fair point on the cold rainy nights, not my thing but I can get it.", "I appreciate this input from your comment. You\u2019re the only response to my comment that has even remotely swayed my opinion.", "Yep it\u2019s happened to me many times. They just don\u2019t make products good enough for heavy night times.", "I of course will yield to your experience. My second point still stands tho", "It was unreasonable for him to ask because he still wouldn\u2019t have been comfortable with the idea of her in the bed on those sheets with her period.", "I sincerely doubt she\u2019s intentionally being disrespectful and don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fair way to frame this.\nThere\u2019s space between telling her what to wear and what she\u2019s comfortable wearing to sleep in, and having to feel pressured and scrutinized over this (I\u2019d leave to avoid this extra stress).\n I also don\u2019t personally believe pants particularly offer more protection that shorts because vaginas aren\u2019t by our knees.", "I\u2019ve found immediately soaking in OxyClean can help, it prevented my favorite expensive and light colored leggings from being ruined. But yeah, I think every women has experienced having a nice pair of underwear never being the same. I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to take that risk with crazy expensive sheets", "She immediately got mad and told me she was going home? I guess she did", "I worked at a hotel as a maid, seriously don\u2019t worry about it. We have tons of sheets! It all goes to an industrial laundry centre, and if it\u2019s stained beyond use it\u2019ll just be thrown away.\n\u2026.and no one remembers you, trust me, you don\u2019t need to feel embarrassed either.", "Oo. Thank you for this genuinely. I'll need to see if they do UK.", "I don't have particularly heavy but period pants for sleeping are the best! (pants = underwear, UK) \n\non that note the title of this reads very differently if you are British....", "Thinx puts forever chemicals in their panties, if you're concerned about that.", "She bled through a pad in an hour. From experience with heavy flow that's going to be like a band aid when someone cut your leg off. In the UK that's a heavy enough flow that the NHS strongly suggests seeking medical attention.", "I should edit to \"the ones I've bought in the UK aren't\". Apparently technology has moved on and I am genuinely delighted by this. There is a possibility I may one day own unstsined sheets.", "I mean, there can be reasons and excuses for acting like an asshole, but that doesn\u2019t make it not acting like an asshole. Can still have a good night\u2019s sleep on cheaper sheets. Myself, I\u2019d actually sleep better not stressing about leaking on expensive sheets all night.", "I never disagreed that she could make efforts to prevent leaks but leaks could still potentially happen even if she were to wear pants is my point. \n\nPersonally I would just opt for period specific sheets to be safer than sorry, however OP shouldn't have to switch his sheets if that's not a compromise he wants make. But when it's time for blood don't be surprised when there is blood.", "Maternity biker shorts 5/5 lol. Fit over my angry uterus bloat and keeps pad snugly in place.\n\nHonestly I'm planning on making myself a pair of perfect period pyjama pants with no front seam but a double layer of fabric like in men's boxers. Not to act as period panties per se, but as a backup + pad fits better with no front seam. I've also seen shorts with pockets for hot water bottle so you can lay on your side and the hot water will stay in place!", "My periods would have soaked through any sweatpants. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re the magic bullets he thinks they are", "Or you just somehow miss the pad entirely, no matter how big it is \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It\u2019s not about the area they cover, it\u2019s about the thickness of the material. Sweatpants are generally made of thicker material than boxer shorts.\n\nAnd yes, it\u2019s not fair to force her to wear something she is uncomfortable in, but he compromised by pulling out the less expensive sheets and she still had an issue.", "They're not???!!! Then I've been doing the sex all wrong!!!", "That\u2019s my point. If she could huff off back to her place she could have just gone back earlier to get more supplies, or to the store.", "Oh sorry I\u2019m not disagreeing with you as such, I was just lightly adding to the point.", "I don\u2019t think anything in this post actually implies he thinks of it as a magic bullet but was just looking for some solution to not ruin expensive sheets. If sweatpants don\u2019t work that\u2019s one thing but based on the post he didn\u2019t sit there insisting she wear sweatpants, he suggested it and she just said there would be no issue at all and got mad when he took another solution of changing the sheets", "Yeah it goes for a random walk before it decides where it\u2019s gonna land.", "After going on and on about her needing to change.\nHe could have changed the sheets after the accident earlier and not made such a fuss about it...", "Yeah I see, I was wondering if she didn\u2019t have any more hence her objection about it, as why wouldn\u2019t you want to avoid embarrassment and potentially leaking, why wouldn\u2019t you take the extra joggers and be okay with the old sheets?  \n\nThen again. Hormones on your time of the month, well they can be unexplainable lol", "Oh fair enough yeah! Honestly a pad in an hour (If he's sure on timings) might explain why no spare pads because that shouldn't be an expected bleed for anyone."]}
