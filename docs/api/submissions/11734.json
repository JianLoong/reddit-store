While everyone was happy for her at first, me and her parents noticed that my 14 year old nephew was really nervous around him. \n\nWe managed to get the reason out of him and it was absolutely terrible. Jim used to work where my nephew played hockey at and bullied him bad.\n\nMy nephew\u2019s name is something similar to Jack but Jim would call him Jackie 24/7 and treat him like a girl. He really had it out for him and he had other people join too. My nephew quit hockey because of him, and even developed a panic disorder. This all happened in a span of a year and it was a really tough time. \n\nSo when I found out that Jim was the cause of all this, I\u2019ll admit, I freaked out.\n\nHer parents talked to her about it and turns out she knew. She said that her brother\u2019s always been a little sensitive anyways. We were all shocked. She didn\u2019t budge though and said she plans on marrying Jim so we\u2019d better move on already. \n\nMy brother and his wife are devastated. They can\u2019t control who she dates but they no longer let him come over. My niece is still insisting that everyone\u2019s overreacting.\n\nMy brother and his wife were out. It was just me and my nephew when the doorbell rang. It was Jim and my niece. I told them to please leave but my niece said no. She said that I have even less authority over her than her parents do so id better move out of her way. \n\nI said no and told her to come back alone and I might consider letting her in. She said that her and Jim are a package deal. So I said then leave. She was all huffy and said that I\u2019m being unfair and she can\u2019t choose who she loves, Jim even tried to say that he\u2019s changed but I refused to hear it and eventually just shut the door in their faces. I heard my niece yelling though. Called me every name in the book and accused me of favouring her crybaby of a brother. She even suggested that her brother was manipulating all of us. \n\nWhile I definitely don\u2019t believe that last part, it\u2019s true that I have no authority over her and therefore have no right to say anything to her. I suppose I should\u2019ve just ignored her instead of arguing back and trying to \u201clecture\u201d her. Throughout all of this, she never lost her cool but she did when I shut the door on her. She said I had no right and that she lives here while I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole necessarily but I\u2018m not sure about my treatment towards my niece. Maybe instead of attacking her so much, I could\u2019ve listened. Plus if I managed to make her believe in me favouring her brother than I must be doing something wrong.

You shouldnt have had to deal with this at all, but crap happens.   You dealt with it very well.", "NTA you were left in charge of the minor child, whose parents have banned Jim from the home.\n\n\"Called me every name in the book and accused me of favouring her crybaby of a brother.\"  Wow.

You were temp guardian of the minor so you DID have authority to protect him. She hasn\u2019t lost her cool in front of anyone because she\u2019s living a lie and trying her hardest to prove it.  She lost it when you shut the door because the jig is up and she\u2019s not going to be able to manipulate everyone any longer.  She thought she was in control and now she\u2019s not. \n\nAlso - you SHOULD be favoring her brother at this point.

You've got nothing to feel bad about, and I'm sure your nephew and brother/SIL are grateful you put an end to it.\n\nEdit after re-reading: Yes, you are favoring your nephew because he is a CHILD.  She is an adult who is choosing to associate with her brother's bully, and is adding to the awful treatment he received at Jim's hands.

Sure, you don't live there, but her parents -who own the house- no longer let him (Jim) come over, she was disrespecting that. \n\nAnd your nephew was there as well, he would probably be distraught having to face his bully and at his own home. \n\nAlso, your niece sounds awful, why would she want to date him when he bullies someone much younger than him, and her own brother at that", "NTA. You're not stopping HER from coming in, you're protecting your NEPHEW from having a bully come into HIS house. At this point, your nephew has two bullies- Jim, and his sister.

Just the same if you were watching her and she was grounded to no phone and they advised you, you would uphold that as well.\n\nIf Jim truly has changed then what has he done to fix the situation? Has he come over to the house specifically to apologize for how he acted? I do believe people can change but they need to show that not say it. NGL I would act the same as you and your brother.

The priority here has to be the protection of the minor child. \n\nHer trying to push past you; to bring the predator into the house? Wow.
