While everyone was happy for her at first, me and her parents noticed that my 14 year old nephew was really nervous around him. \n\nWe managed to get the reason out of him and it was absolutely terrible. Jim used to work where my nephew played hockey at and bullied him bad.\n\nMy nephew\u2019s name is something similar to Jack but Jim would call him Jackie 24/7 and treat him like a girl. He really had it out for him and he had other people join too. My nephew quit hockey because of him, and even developed a panic disorder. This all happened in a span of a year and it was a really tough time. \n\nSo when I found out that Jim was the cause of all this, I\u2019ll admit, I freaked out.\n\nHer parents talked to her about it and turns out she knew. She said that her brother\u2019s always been a little sensitive anyways. We were all shocked. She didn\u2019t budge though and said she plans on marrying Jim so we\u2019d better move on already. \n\nMy brother and his wife are devastated. They can\u2019t control who she dates but they no longer let him come over. My niece is still insisting that everyone\u2019s overreacting.\n\nMy brother and his wife were out. It was just me and my nephew when the doorbell rang. It was Jim and my niece. I told them to please leave but my niece said no. She said that I have even less authority over her than her parents do so id better move out of her way. \n\nI said no and told her to come back alone and I might consider letting her in. She said that her and Jim are a package deal. So I said then leave. She was all huffy and said that I\u2019m being unfair and she can\u2019t choose who she loves, Jim even tried to say that he\u2019s changed but I refused to hear it and eventually just shut the door in their faces. I heard my niece yelling though. Called me every name in the book and accused me of favouring her crybaby of a brother. She even suggested that her brother was manipulating all of us. \n\nWhile I definitely don\u2019t believe that last part, it\u2019s true that I have no authority over her and therefore have no right to say anything to her. I suppose I should\u2019ve just ignored her instead of arguing back and trying to \u201clecture\u201d her. Throughout all of this, she never lost her cool but she did when I shut the door on her. She said I had no right and that she lives here while I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole necessarily but I\u2018m not sure about my treatment towards my niece. Maybe instead of attacking her so much, I could\u2019ve listened. Plus if I managed to make her believe in me favouring her brother than I must be doing something wrong.

You shouldnt have had to deal with this at all, but crap happens.

She lost it when you shut the door because the jig is up and she\u2019s not going to be able to manipulate everyone any longer.  She thought she was in control and now she\u2019s not. \n\nAlso - you SHOULD be favoring her brother at this point.

You've got nothing to feel bad about, and I'm sure your nephew and brother/SIL are grateful you put an end to it.\n\nEdit after re-reading: Yes, you are favoring your nephew because he is a CHILD.  She is an adult who is choosing to associate with her brother's bully, and is adding to the awful treatment he received at Jim's hands.

Sure, you don't live there, but her parents -who own the house- no longer let him (Jim) come over, she was disrespecting that. \n\nAnd your nephew was there as well, he would probably be distraught having to face his bully and at his own home. \n\nAlso, your niece sounds awful, why would she want to date him when he bullies someone much younger than him, and her own brother at that", "NTA. You're not stopping HER from coming in, you're protecting your NEPHEW from having a bully come into HIS house. At this point, your nephew has two bullies- Jim, and his sister.

Has he come over to the house specifically to apologize for how he acted? I do believe people can change but they need to show that not say it. NGL I would act the same as you and your brother.

The priority here has to be the protection of the minor child. \n\nHer trying to push past you; to bring the predator into the house? Wow.

He would understand why he wasn't welcome and stay away until invited.", "No it was shocking. I saw red and my brother and I almost did something we\u2019d likely regret. This was a 20 year old man that found it funny to bully my 13 (at the time) year old nephew for no reason. My nephew loved hockey and now everything about it makes him upset. And what? He thought that we wouldn\u2019t care because he\u2018s dating my niece? Like hell.", "Wonder if Jim had a certain interest in your nephew  and still does.", ">\t As long she\u2019s picking the bully over her own family, she shouldn\u2019t be allowed in their home.\n\nAs long, and long after. Certain choices are character defining\u2014and she made hers.", "Hm that seems pretty likely. It\u2019s not like she was ever present for the bullying and I guess she\u2019s just choosing to believe her boyfriend over her brother. He does seem to go overboard for her which was great at first but now it just seems a bit off.", "she's an adult and her brother is a child. gaslighting and abuse doesn't explain her behavior", "i was barely 18 when i started being abused by a 20 yo. generally abusers can't convince a 21 yo to abuse children like this. esp. when they're *both* 21.", "The niece is one of the bullies \ud83d\ude10", "She does. The owner of that house left op in charge so she can bar entry.", "You\u2019re agreeing with each other. That\u2019s what the statement that she is apparently just as much as a bully means. It\u2019s stating that she IS a bully.", "Oh, I agree that bullying is terrible at any age. Was hoping Jim was much younger and very immature when he did this but sadly not.\n\nGiven how much the nephew was traumatized, this had to be continuous, sadistic bullying which makes the niece's relationship with Jim horrifying!", "She's apparently been sleeping at the abusers place, when she's not at her parents. But, now she no longer has keys to the parents house, I imagine she'll be spending even more time sleeping with the abuser. So, she's literally made her bed and is in sleeping in it", "\u201cHe does seem to go overboard for her, which was great at first, but now just seems a bit off.\u201d\nYou\u2019re describing love-bombing. It\u2019s a manipulation/abuse tactic. Premature promises (talking about marriage/moving in together too fast) showering the person with gifts and compliments, etc. If you look it up, I\u2019m sure you will see it. It\u2019s exactly how your niece\u2019s boyfriend is acting. He sounds like bad news.", "Keep on supporting your nephew. I\u2019m disgusted that someone 7 years older bullied him. I hope no one from your side of the family goes to that shitshow of a wedding. NTA update us later on that please.", "IMO, *it may be* a reason for the behavior, but it *does not justify it*. Sis is still a major AH.", "Yes- and people turn into bullies because they didn't get enough therapy when they needed it. Well adjusted, emotionally balanced happy people do not bully others.", "I understand we are agreeing with each other, I was taking the qualifier off the statement.  As in there is no apparent about it, it is definite.", "Yeah.\n\nAnd how many people failed to begin with - that managers didn\u2019t step in, that owners didn\u2019t step in, the coaches - Jim should have been fired.\n\nShe acts like being \u201cin love\u201d doesn\u2019t mean being in a relationship and around someone (and trying to bring them in to the home of their victim) isn\u2019t a choice.", "Why are they gonna let one his biggest bullies be involved in learning his condition? So she can use it against him more? Be for real, if she was a good person, that would be different. But she not only agrees with what her bf did, but also acts similar/the same. She can go to her own, separate therapy and get her own help. But until then, she and her bf can stay away.", "**Sadistic bullies are very good about only showing their cruelty when others can't see it.** I'm not totally excusing managers, owners, and coaches but bullies like this target certain kids and abuse them in private. **They go out of their way to be positive and supportive to other kids, in large part so no one will believe that they are capable of behaving so horribly.** This is calculated cruel abuse and the nephew will never be safe around Jim.", "She lives in the house though. The parents either have to kick her out (and we can sit and judge here on reddit but in reality how many parents could stomach doing that) or they need to work with her so she can be more empathetic. If it were me I'd inform her a condition of having a place to live is being kind and here's some therapy to help with that. If lines were crossed then time to live somewhere else. But this isn't some random neighbor bully it's his _sister_ who _lives in the same house_. This whole family should be in therapy _together_ and individually.", "It also makes me concerned about the potential for intimate partner violence, tbh.", "They already started conditions. First was \"no *specific bf* allowed AT ALL\". Seeing as she was trying to take him in, knowing they were out of town, i'd say new conditions will be coming soon. More often than not, an abuser/bully isn't going to change their ways if they refuse to admit they need help. Therapy doesn't work when you don't want it to/tell yourself it won't. Part of the process of the sis getting ANYWHERE with any therapy is getting rid of the bf, which isn't going to happen as it sounds more like she's clinging on to him hardcore."]}
