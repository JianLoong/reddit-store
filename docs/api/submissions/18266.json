I have to admit, I haven't given a thought in that direction. I'm privileged enough to come from a family that doesn't believe in gender norms, so my mind didn't go in that direction. Also some of you suggested RM's father could have been abusive towards her mother or her. Considering all that, I decided to have a talk with her.\n\nThankfully, her father isn't an alcoholic or abusive, but it became very apparent to me that her parents, especially her mother, is extremely controlling. If anyone doesn't know, breaking out of a mother's control, especially as a daughter, is very difficult. When I sat her down and talked with her, she apologized for the profanities and behaving the way she did. As it happens, her mother all but warned her to not get close to me, because of which she stopped interacting with me completely.\n\nI told her I understand, and that I was there for her. I told her that I would have understood if she told me what happened. She replied by saying that she didn't really know what to do or what to say to me or to her mother. While I said we've resolved this and she really doesn't have to move out, she said she thinks that her moving out is actually a good idea, because she feels she'd piss her mother off more if she continues to share with me.\n\nMeanwhile since a couple of people suggested that I move to the Railway Quarters, I looked into that. I plan on shifting my mother and my grandparents here because it would be easier for my mother if she stays with me, since one of my younger siblings is already staying in their university's hostel and the other would be leaving for their university in August/September. I definitely cannot house my mother and grandparents in the current flat. One of my dad's old friends who still works with me kindly agreed to look into it and see if he can speed up the process due to his connections.\n\nI told my RM if the processing and paperwork goes through, I will move into the Quarters in September, and since their new semester starts in September, she can find a new roommate who is more \"acceptable\" to her parents and keep the place. I also told her that if she decides to stand up to her mother, I will be by her side and support her, no questions asked.\n\nPS: People from other countries, please don't start saying that me getting my dad's old job is fake or my culture is unfortunate because it expects me to take care of my family. Every country operates differently, and due to different societal situations, we have laws and policies that might seem strange to you. And every culture has different ways of doing things, and I think this is one of the very nice things about mine. I would have taken care of my parents and grandparents anyway, even if my father hadn't been in the accident and lived to see his retirement.", "created_utc": 1685157113, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13swhak/update_aita_for_calling_my_roommates_family_a/", "score": 904, "replies": ["I'm glad you spoke with her and was able to work it out. \n\nGood luck to you and your family.", "I commented on the original and am glad there has been some resolution.

You have my condolences. *HUG*", "Kudos to you. I saw your first post about the job being given to you on compassionate grounds and knew it was my country. You're doing good.

My grandfather worked in railways. His kids did not take up his job because they didn't think it was good enough, but they did regret it later. I am so proud to have known you through this post. You're a brilliant, mind-blowing person. You're a powerhouse for taking on a job we know is still in a million ways, male dominated. Hat's off friend. Take care!", "I'm so glad things are working fine for you.. \nJust for people from other countries, the Indian govt does provide jobs to dependent of the deceased in case of a death while still working under the die in harness scheme. It is highly functional and very useful for so many families and has been in place for decades.", "Proud of you for being a supportive friend to that young woman, and for doing the right thing for your family as well.  (This is from an American who was raised elsewhere.)", "I am happy you were able to reach a satisfying conclusion to your situation. Your decision of moving to the Railway Quarters with your mother and sister is a good one too- the area will probably have better facilities and security and you and your family will be able to enjoy each other's companionship (your mother won't find your shifts odd at all, since your father probably had the same schedule). \n\nGood luck OP, I am proud of you\u2764", "Well handled. I know a few people in the railway. One is an older lady who used to announce trains. She told me that when she first started only one of the all male train traffic controllers welcomed her.", "hell yeah! Nice job being an adult!! I'm sorry you had to have issues, but I'm glad you are ok.\n\nI'm happy you like doing things that you and your dad used to do together. A lot of people don't get to have that connection and nice memories of their parents.\n\nI hope you get nothing but happiness for the rest of your days!", "I love how this came out, both for you and the roommate.\n\nYou didn't owe this girl any grace after she attacked you that way, but you gave her some anyway bc you realized that she was reacting to family pressure. You are a queen for this, seriously. Hopefully this young lady is able to finish her studies, get out from under her mother's suffocation, and pay it forward some day.", "Some wars aren't worth winning.

We both paid rent to the house owner. It wasn't my flat to begin with. I only now applied for the Quarters and it is still in processing. I'm not having a roommate in my subsidized railway alloted flat because I'm not living in a subsidized railway alloted flat.", "I think the keyboard warrior above is probably bitter they don't have a cool job or tight knit family like yours!", "Ignore this person op, they are a misogynist.", "Probably better than you.", "Thanks for the update! I live in the US I would love to take on that kind of job from my parents. Nice work in having a conversation with your Rm. I too come from a mom who is controlling and narcissistic. Not as bad as disagreeing with past RMs I had, but enough that I\u2019ve alienated most of not all of my friends.", "My dad got sick at the end of his life and I moved in with him. My brother and I loved being with him and each other. I\u2019m HAPPY your culture encourages that kind of connection as an American. It happens here that love wins out more often than is expressed and children step up. It\u2019s unfortunate these children don\u2019t get the recognition here when this works. \n\nThis is the best balance I think either of you can achieve. I wish you both the best.", "OP, you are a good, good person.  \n\nYou choose to behave kindly, responsibly and unselfishly and communicate with others who are less fortunate in terms of family support than yourself.  That is really generous and thoughtful of you. \n\nI wish you all the best and all the happiness.", "OP, you are a wonderful and caring person.  It was so kind of you to invite the open and honest conversation you had with your roommate.  You offered her support, strength, and understanding when you were the one disrespected.  You are even trying to help her living situation.\nNo matter what your country's family culture is, your family is so so lucky to have such a loving, smart and competent daughter.  No one's life ends up following our imagined, ideal plan.  You have made your choices from your heart and embraced them.\nAlso, I admire your hobby!", "I said on OPs original post that she sounds like a stellar lady with her head on right and this post only re-enforces that statement. Damn good person.", "You are a good friend and I hope your roommate learns from you. Good luck with the new move!", "I absolutely agree. Considering I'm part of the same culture, and I'm definitely going to do my best to take care of my parents, I understand to some degree just how hard it is for her and the fact that she's doing amazing and she's so kind just warms my heart"]}
