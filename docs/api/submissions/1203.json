If even the TAs don't know what's going on, you've got a bad professor. It's not your responsibility to remedy.", "NAH. It's not your responsibility to teach them, its the University professor. However I think the main issue here is that the **majority** of the students don't understand the topic. Its more concerning that the professors assistants don't even understand the course content. You are all paying to be taught so a complaint should be given to investigate this.", "NTA. That's the job of your professors and the assistants. Your job is to leave an honest review after the course ends that explains everything that went wrong here.", "Its a bit bit shitty. However, I get your reasons and I respect them. As long you don't get mad if something similar happens to you and you are in the position of your classmate, then NAH.", "YTA. If you go in there and expect help you should help others. You shouldn\u2019t build yourself up by purposefully tearing others down. That\u2019s deplorable.", "I'm just confused at the type of university that rewards people for knowing less material, and is highly competitive yet lowers standards rather than holding people to them. It doesn't seem like a promising educational model.", "You\u2019re right, it\u2019s not your responsibility, it\u2019s the professor\u2019s.\n\nWhile I think that you\u2019re NTA I think you should consider the following:\n1. If your answers are right and the others find that out they might get mad at you and blame you for not saying something in the group chat, and maybe exclude you from future learning sessions etc.\n2. If you help them now, they might help you later.\n\nSo maybe you should re-evaluate the situation and find out what will benefit you in the long run, because if 300 people remember you as someone who is bright and helpful it might help you later on", "It's just a general groupchat of the class, people organising night outs, parties, help, study sessions etc. It's just a way for students to interact in regards to the degree. I sometimes participate, and its useful because sometimes people talk about stuff that can help me, but I have really bad social anxiety so I don't often talk there", "This. You\u2019re not the professor and maybe the professor needs to be speaking to their TA\u2019s to make sure they understand/ask why the TA\u2019s didn\u2019t approach the professor to admit they don\u2019t understand. NTA as it\u2019s not your job. The professor and TA\u2019s are there for a reason.", "At the end of the semester its possible to submit a feedback form, but since this is a core module that everyone has to take, it's unlikely that anything will change. Other than that, I know many of us are planning to submit a quite honest and scathing feedback form because everything is very confusing", "I see what you mean, but is not helping someone the same as purposefully tearing them down? It's not like I'm giving them the wrong answer on purpose, just refusing to help.", "I was under the impression that most universities and education systems in the world have grading curves, and I don't think it rewards for knowing less material, just adjusts boundaries to grades. So if everyone does really bad, and one person does decently, they would be getting a slightly better grade than if everyone did decently. Hope this makes sense, I'm sure you can find a better explanation if you google bell curve grading or grading curves as my main language isn't English.", "This is good advice, I have helped before, it's just that in this case where I'm not sure of my own grade I would rather maximise my chances of getting a better grade, if that makes sense. \n\nI doubt people would find out considering there's like 500 students in this class total and 300 in the chat, and no one has shared their grades before.", "Eugh, I always found those feedback forms completely useless. I had a course module in 3d animation...our professor **did not** know how to 3d animate??? (we had to ask our other professor to come in and show us). Despite filling in the form, nothing changed. Our head professor completely understood our frustration but our grades couldn't be changed in the end.", "Lying by omission is still lying. So yes. In a way you are purposefully hurting them to build yourself up. Even a comment like: I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what it was asking. I\u2019d check with the TA. You aren\u2019t giving them the answer but letting them know they need to check with someone for more help. That\u2019s not giving them the answer it\u2019s suggesting they seek clarification.", "I see!\nWell, as I said I think you\u2019re NTA and I understand your approach in this specific situation. \nI wish you all the best for this course and I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with a professor like that (I\u2019ve been there before)", "Haha yeah universities aren't very good at getting feedback. I had a class last year that was at 8-9pm! Which is fucking crazy, most students left feedback to change the time but nothing changed.", "But lying by omission implies I'm answering, I can't be lying in any way if i simply ignore the texts. I'm not omitting anything, it's texts sent to \\~300 people and I'm simply not answering. I don't really understand your view here. \n\nAlso, I'd like to add that I think I am right, but I can't be 100% sure until the work is graded, so I could theoretically be giving them the wrong information too.", "I know you think you\u2019re right. That doesn\u2019t make you right. It wouldn\u2019t have hurt anyone for you to suggest they clarify with someone else. But you want the better grade so you knowingly let them continue to think they are right. Let\u2019s put it in a different context. We know each other (in my example not in real life). I\u2019ve seen you around campus with your partner. I\u2019ve seen you holding hands and kissing. I know this is your partner. But I went out last night and saw said partner...making out with someone else. You talk about how the partner is amazing today and how you plan on marrying them and you guys are talking about a June wedding blah blah blah. I just smile and you and tell you how great you guys look together and how you are the perfect pair. I mean...I\u2019m just ignoring what I saw. Who cares if your partner is sleeping around...I\u2019m not really omitting anything because I\u2019m simply not answering and others saw it and could speak up. Plus I\u2019d like to add I\u2019m right bc I can\u2019t be 100% Sure you guys don\u2019t have an open relationship so I could theoretically be giving you the wrong information anyway. (I mean maybe your partner has a twin.)", ">clarify with someone else\n\nBut as I have stated, not even the TAs understand the assignment, there's no one that can confirm whether they are correct or not. \n\nAnd I don't think your example is anything like this scenario. In a situation where you are friends with them, you have an obligation to tell them the truth, in a scenario where a person asks for help on basically a public forum, that obligation isn't there. It's like saying you're TA because you saw a reddit post asking for help and didn't answer."]}
