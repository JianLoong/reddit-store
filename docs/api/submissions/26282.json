If she fed the baby right before she left being gone for just three hours thats cutting it pretty close. If the baby was screaming that long it was probably hungry or needed to be changed. What if that baby had rolled over and suffocated? All it takes is a few minutes of squirming around on pillows and blankets (unsafe for sleep) for something to obstruct a baby's airway.

Your sister didn't need help with bills so much as she needed a live in babysitter.

Really, the kids loved being out and about and I had no other choice. Yes, it took longer but was a time for them to look around and for me to talk to them and teach them about the world. I can\u2019t imagine being unable to take little ones on errands.", "Woah, woah, woah. The arrogance of your sister. She didn't have the decency to tell (she should have asked) you to watch her kid. You were working. You pay a lot of the rent. I'm assuming if you wanted to play house you would have had kids of your own. I can't believe you're even entertaining the possibility you were wrong. I would have fixed her little red wagon and demanded payment. How else will she learn. Your sister should be very glad I'm not her sister because we would have some mother fucking problems.", "NTA. I am a mom and I would NEVER leave my child with someone without having a full discussion about it. Especially a 5 month old!! She is the mom and it is not your job to watch the child. If you are willing to watch her then that is great. Just because someone lived in the house with me, I would never assume a non-parent was watching the child without asking. When leaving a baby with someone you always make sure they have the milk or formula they need, diapers and clean clothes. You tell them the last time the baby ate and when the baby will need to eat again. A few minutes is one thing but a few hours? You were working, what did she think would happen?\n\nIf she has errands to run then she should have either taken the baby with her or talked to you about it before leaving. She abandoned her child without even letting you know she was leaving. That is unacceptable and definitely not your fault.", "A bit off topic but I have three children and took all of them with me when I had errands to run. What is this new parenting obsession to leave children behind to run errands? I even took my children with me if I had hairdresser appointments. I just don\u2019t get it when I read AITA posts about mums sulking that no one will look after their kids so they can run errands. Just your kids with you.", "NTA and you need something in writing with her stating procedure, even an email or text. What would have happened if the kid got hurt? If a fire broke out? If the police were banging on the door? If something had happened you could have been charged with child endangerment even though you never agreed.", "NTA by any means. You were at work.

Your sister didn\u2019t ask you, and didn\u2019t check with you & just left. She\u2019s probably feeling guilty about leaving her baby essentially alone & is taking it out on you.

It\u2019s crazy having a baby so I know you can get mom brain and forget things. She forgot to follow the correct procedure for making sure her baby was cared for.

The difference was rest OP was a man, and extremely hard of hearing/ essentially deaf without his hearing aids. Which, he didn't usually wear at home, especially on the weekend.

I\u2019m kind of guessing she really wanted to think they didn\u2019t cancel \u201ceverything\u201d (like a screaming baby) and you\u2019d figure it out. She needs CPS up her ass if there\u2019s ever a second time and you need to impress that upon her, and if she ever pulls a stunt like that again, you will report her and also move.", "Noooo dude! This is so negligent! This is a conversation that absolutely requires eye contact and verbal confirmation. She knew you were wearing headphones, whyyyyy did she not make 100% sure you knew she was leaving.\nI can only imagine how terrible you feel, you have to know this is not your fault. NTA", "Put a sign on the door.\n\nOpen door n tap me to get attention. Cant hear have headphones on.", "I'm sorry, but what a terrible mother your sister is. That is terrible. How could you possibly be the AH for not doing something you had no idea about. \n\nPoor baby though. I feel so terrible for the baby.", "Who's fault would it have been if something happened to that baby?!", "NTA. I feel for both you and your sister. Being a single parent is hard and god knows how exhausted she is; when you don\u2019t get enough sleep your brain is kinda fried sometimes. So unless there\u2019s background history you didn\u2019t mention I\u2019d try to be gentle.", "I suggest getting a baby monitor. That way you can see the baby in the crib even if you can\u2019t hear them.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t trust your sister to remember about the headphones.\n\nDo it for yourself because I know you don\u2019t want the baby to be crying and be ignored.", "NTA. Sister didn\u2019t confirm that you were aware. It\u2019s her fault.", "NTA you were working and she ignored your request and boundaries regarding your WFH job. It\u2019s not your fault she doesn\u2019t understand you need to get verbal consent to leave a baby with someone!", "NTA. This is your sister's fault for not confirming with you that you could watch the kid.", "NTA-maybe put a sign in your door saying \u2018working-if you need something, tap my shoulder\u2019 With a picture of a person tapping a shoulder\n\nYou know\u2026 cause she needs clear directions and pictures to figure that out", "You have nothing to feel bad about I would NEVER leave my child with someone who didn\u2019t make eye contact with me and confirm and accept verbally they had their full attention on my infant. NTA", "NTA \n\nThis is 100% on your sister. I hope the baby is okay!", "NTA.  Make it clear that when you are working, you will not be able to provide childcare.   Put a big yellow sign on the door say \"Do Not Disturb, Woman at Work!\"  People seem to forget that working at home means that you have work to do.", "NTA, she should have atleast notified you that she was leaving you with her child. Not your fault if you had no idea what was going on.", "NTA. You\u2019re literally paying for her rent, and helping her so much, and she can\u2019t follow such a simple instruction? After you told her so many times? And she left her kid alone? She doesn\u2019t deserve her kid if she\u2019s so neglectful.", "NTA OP", "NTA\n\nThis was her screw up, she didn't wait to see if you actually heard her. She didn't wait to get a verbal confirmation from you to say yes I'll look after her.\n\nSo this is entirely on her not you", "NTA, this one is on her for failing to confirm. And esp. since you\u2019ve told her multiple times you can\u2019t hear her with the headphones on.", "I need those headphones for sleeping.  What brand are they??", "NTA. Don't let her pass the buck. She screwed up. If she can't remember that you're not *a psychic* so you need to hear her say things out loud, that's pretty much on her. You don't need to feel bad about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess I'm curious, though. You're working, and you pay the majority of the bills. So... What exactly do *you* get out of this arrangement? Other than yelled at, I mean. Your sister seems to be taking for granted how much you're doing for her already, since she thinks she gets at-will childcare out of it too.", "NTA. Seriously, as a parent, you always confirm someone is watching your kid. Always.  That's your responsibility, and only yours.  You sister Seriously F'd up.\nShe intentionally left her child, for hours, without confirming there would be someone to watch her.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Your sister chose to leave her baby alone without confirming that you would care for the baby. She chose to leave before getting a response from you or tapping you on the shoulder. The fault is all hers", "NTA\n\n\\-and you should yell at your sister for leaving her child unattended. This is on her, and only her.", "NTA and I\u2019m a mom. \n\nYou always check and double check where childcare is concerned. It\u2019s pretty important. \n\nYour sister needs to check herself, honestly.", "buy her a mirror. NTA", "NTA for being an innocent bystander when your sister recklessly abandoned her infant. Talk to her, and if she refuses to talk, leave a note on the fridge explaining that abandoning a helpless infant was irresponsible of her. CPS gets called on parents that do this, and rightfully so.", "Nta. Most ppl take their kids w them to run errands if no one is available. She knew you were working  but lets go w the thought that maybe she thought you heard her. Did she hear a yes? A \"thats fine?\" No. She did not have permission. & the moment you failed to answer should have reminded her that you cant hear her. She sounds like shes slipping down the slope. Thats some bad parenting & she needs to stop blaming anyone other than herself (or it will happen again)", "OP, NTA!!! 100%!!! Yes, baby needed care but this is ALL on your sister. You didn't mistreat your niece. Your sister was willing to risk her baby suffering to make some stupid point. For what?", "You might have to give her an ultimatum: either she starts following your rules in getting your attention and respects you, or you will move out.", "Not the asshole. Your sister needs to grow up", "You are NTA here and your sister needs to figure out how to remember what you\u2019ve told her you need to do. You haven\u2019t created unreasonable expectations for her. That she left a 5MO baby with you without being sure you heard her is pretty crazy. Seriously, what\u2019s wrong with her?", "NTA", "Wow. Your sister is being irrational. You have to wear headphones because of HER loudness, and she can\u2019t get it through her head that this is the reality? She\u2019s a dick", "NTA, but leave ASAP. No more assistance with rent and bills. She will continue to do this. Mom can take care of her if she\u2019s so helpless. Do. Not. Stay.", "NTA.  But I know who is.", "NTA.  Your sister is entirely at fault.  She may have said she told you but you never responded so how could she know that you heard her?  Also, leaving a 5-month-old would require a discussion with you about the baby's schedule.\n\nI bet your sister knocked on your door or poked her head in your room, but didn't get your attention, and just left thinking she wouldn't be gone as long as she was.\n\nTell your sister you understand the stress she is under, being a new mother and newly single but she can't blame you for what she did.  She needs to confirm with you that she is leaving before holding you responsible for her daughter's care.", "First of all, she has you living with her to help pay bills. Secondly,  you're paying the lions share of said bills. She is essentially living with you. But we'll leave that alone for this discussion.  Living under the same roof doesn't equal live in babysitter. You should absolutely make this clear to your sister.  The fact that you are paying most of the bills and that she doesn't respect you enough to leave you alone while you're working is throwing some big red flags for me. She expects you to work AND babysit so that she isn't inconvenienced by having to haul your niece around? The entitlement has me ready to help move you out. If she needs help with child care on her own terms, I recommend she hires a professional.  If she's not willing or able to do so, then she needs to work around other people's schedules. NTA.", "so she left the house without telling you and she left her infant at home without telling you? wtf", "It's for a serious conversation with your sister.\n\n1.  You moved in to help with bills, not childcare.  This is especially true if you are working to pay those bills.\n2.  I don't care who she leaves her child with, you have verbal confirmation that they know when you are leaving and what is expected of them.\n3.  She has no right to be mad at you and refuses to speak to you when she lacks common sense when it comes to the care of HER child.\n4.  If this is how she wants to behave you will go work from home somewhere that doesn't require you to have noise cancelling headphones.  However, this will also be the place you live and pay your bills so she better look for a new roommate.\n\nAlso 1000% NTA", "NTA, but your sister is", "NTA stop feeling guilty it's not your fault \n\nand also sit your sister down and tell her you can pay the bills by WORKING A and as such you are NOT HER BABYSITTER. SHE CAN TAKE HER CHILD WITH HER ON ERRANDS when you work if she doesn't have childcare available.\n\n It's a bit more difficult than without the baby but quite doable.\n\n\nTell her to pull her head out of her a$$ or the next time she interferes with your job you will move out and she damn better have a plan in place to survive on her own\n\n\nYou are already going above and beyond to help her but you are neither her slave not her servant/nanny and you don't owe her sh!t.\n\nShe needs to stop being lazy and care for her child.\n\nAllow me to add that if she does this now what is she going to do when she lives alone? Abandon her child cause it's more inconvenient to go with her on errands?! WTF", "NTA you warned your sister to talk directly to you.", "NTA. As a mom of kids who used to be babies, your sister fucked up. I would have NEVER left my child with someone without looking them dead in the eyes and saying, \"This baby is under your care, do you know where (baby items) are?\".", "NTA. \n\nhow irresponsible!  When you have a kid, you never assume.  No matter how she communicated to you, you NEVER confirmed.  This is completely on her.  I'm sure she feels like an idiot and is now scared and angry.  But she was very irresponsible.   Someone should remind her, she can take the baby with her wherever she goes.  She doesn't need to act like her only option was to leave her with you.  \n\nYou've done more than your share by moving in.  Frankly, after this incident, I'd tell her just to avoid any confusion, you will not be babysitting in the future so she should always plan to make other arrangements.  \n\nAnd then just put your headphones back in and close the door.", "Absolutely NTA. However, I would already be looking for a new place. Sister keeps \"forgetting\" about your headphones? I think not; it's an excuse she uses to not take her baby along. If the baby dies while she is out of the house, who do you think will be jailed for that? Yes, it will probably be you. \n\nYou stepped up to the plate when you didn't have to, and you set clear expectations. Sister is not following your expectations, but suddenly she can \"finally\" remember you have on headphones enough to jerk them off your head and rail at you? I have not had a child myself, but I raised my sister from the time I was 10 onwards (as soon as I got in from school the baby was mine). I realized at 10 that you could never, ever leave a baby alone, and I carried my sister in her carrier to the restroom if I needed to relieve myself or put the carrier outside the shower while peeping out at her every few seconds to be sure something hadn't happened. I carried that child everywhere I went, and your sister should be doing the same thing...but she isn't. Find a new place to live before your sister does this to you again, and heaven forbid, you find yourself arrested for negligent homicide.", "Time to find a place of your own.  Unless you love paying most of the bills for the right to also babysit an infant, especially when you are already working.", "NTA!!! I have 4 kids and couldn\u2019t imagine not having an actual conversation with someone about watching 1 or all of my kids. And even then I still confirm like 2-3 times\u2026 but they are my kids and my responsibility! \n\nMy big question is why couldn\u2019t she take the baby with her? I get that bring kids along make errands longer but that\u2019s what happens when you have kids!", "Since you pay majority of the rent, look into paying that somewhere else if possible. Check a hotel rate. One with a kitchenette so you can at least save on having to eat out. Being a roommate is not being a daycare provider whether it\u2019s family or not. You work too and I think she did it on purpose. She overstepped your boundaries by not respecting them to begin with.", "First and foremost, if you had no idea the child was crying, you are NTA, full stop. \n\nSomeone abandoning their child in your home and then complaining you didn't automatically drop everything to cover what is clearly overtly neglectful parenting, is not your fault. You didn't make her carry to term, she stranded herself with the child and pushing that onto you is just plain wrong. You are not a free-use babysitter.", "So let me get this straight. Your sister dumped her baby on you,  while you were working (which pays the rent and bills) without asking?!!\n\nYeah. I would be rethinking living with someone who was capable of such reckless selfishness.\n\n1) you were working \n2) your work is imperative as its keeping a roof over your head, your sister and niece\n3) your sister shouldn't ask / assume you would babysit\n4) she didn't absolutely confirm the babysitting \n\nNTA", "NTA The fact that your sister is so entitled that she a) didnt confirm and just assume that it is ok with you and b) cant wrap around her mind that you cant literally hear anything from outside and was thusly informed many times is  her problem, not a you problem.", "The pitfalls of working from home. People actually get annoyed at you for working. In this case, you are not the AH since you a.) are helping her out by living there and shouldering a lot of the financial burden; and b.) you had clearly explained the headphone situation to her and she did not do as asked. I feel bad about niece too, but it\u2019s on her mom.", "So I wear nosie canceling headphones as well and have my back to my door for my desk- my partner or house mates will reach in and turn my lights on and off to get my attention if I didn't hear knocking. This may be a good solution if she can come in and tap you. NTA. She needs to step up and be a better parent.", "NTA. Your sister is asking you to take over most of her rent *and* provide babysitting services???\n\nShe failed to get actual confirmation that you were able & willing to watch the baby, and she left you for *a few hours* with an infant, *while you were working*?\n\nThis is not an okay living situation. Part of parenting is modifying plans when you don\u2019t have childcare. She\u2019s not respecting your job, and that was a dangerous decision to assume you heard her say she was leaving but not taking the baby.", "NTA at all. Your sister is stupid and repeatedly \u201cforgets\u201d the reminders you give her to directly ask you anything first as you clearly can\u2019t hear with headphones on. It\u2019s her own fault. Plus, your working! Why are babysitting duties just thrown on you? \n\nYour sister sounds kinda entitled. I wouldn\u2019t put up with it personally", "NTA", "NTA. You literally didn\u2019t know. You should ask your sister how she expected you to do something you didn\u2019t even know that you were suppose to do. Her child is her responsibility, so she should take extra care to make sure you know you\u2019re suppose to take care of your niece.", "Of course you are NTA. Your sister is a negligent mom.", "NTA. Your sister knows the agreement and failed to stick to it. She is TA here.", "A good parent makes sure they have a clear agreement with the person watching their infant. NTA your sister was negligent.", "You're paying her bills, watching her kids, AND she's screaming at you? I'd be out immediately ngl", "Your sister is the asshole here. She is the reason her baby cried for so long, not you. You didnt refuse to take care of the baby, you asked a simples thing in order to do it. She didnt do it. Also, who leaves a baby at someone and dont even talk to that somebody to make sure everything is ok and that someone has some doubts?!\n\nNTA. Your sister is. Also, you move in with your sister to help her out with bills, you pay most of them and still have to babysit for free? She has some nerves to be mad still be mad at you. Ask her if she wants you to move out. Lets see her madness to disapear in a second", "NTA. The absolute best face I can put on your sisters reaction is that she knows she screwed up but is displacing her anger at herself on to you through some old pattern of behaviour. This pattern might not even have anything to do with you; it could be a dance she and her ex did to blame each other.", "NTA  if you really did have the conversation about needing to physically get your attention then of course you're not at fault.", "NTA you were working for a start, so not available for childcare. She also didn't ask and you had no knowledge that you had been left alone with your niece.", "Nta, it's wild she never confirmed. But do tell your secret about having so much focus. 1 minute in work and my mind is on the bahamas.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nIs she out of her mind?! Is she dvmb as a kite?? That's some big negligence on her part.\n\nI forgot what comes after \"dumb as a\" lol", "NTA, move out pls", "In addition, OP shares living space not childcare.", "This. OP, you need to sit down with your sister and tell her that what she did was NOT okay. She never once got a confirmation from you that you were watching her kid. That was reckless. Anything could have happened to the child. You don't want to be involved in this, so if it happens again, you'll be looking for your own place.", "Yep. My SO and I always did an explicit confirmation of which of us was watching bonus kid even if we were both around, if he needed close supervision for any reason.", " Tell her to get it together or you will move out.\n\nNTA", "Especially a baby that\u2019s *five months* old!!", "She told her sister she can\u2019t hear a damn thing when she is working, hence the tapping on the shoulder. Sister clearly didn\u2019t do that and just left her baby with nobody to watch her. And the sister is making her the bad guy for it but sister is at fault here, she is just passing on her guilt to OP", "I do that with my husband EVERY TIME. Like \"I'm going to the toilet. You got eyes on her?\" If he doesn't respond I repeat u till he does. \n\n\nIt's a habit from work. At the daycare where I work we are two adults and 10 kiddies. We always tell when, why and how long we will leave the room for.\n\n\nOP is NTA", "Also sister needs byo get a freaking grip and not ask op to be a babysitter during work hours .

Maybe she thinks OP's headphones don't really cancel out noise and OP was just ignoring her??? No matter what, leaving an infant as bait is evil. I can't imagine any alternate universe where I could justify having done this to my child.\n\nEta: NTA", "Agreed, Imma be honest I would have screamed back at the sister for not taking care of her damn kid, if I were you OP I would set some firm boundaries the first of which being that if she Ever does that again she can kiss having you watch her kid for her goodbye and if she does it again after that tell her she needs to find a new roommate because that's rediculous.", "*This is no different than someone who drops the kids off on the front porch and drives off ..*\n\nYes. It\u2019s exactly the same thing. I would tell her if she pulled anything like that again, I would call CPS. What on earth was she thinking? Have you spoken to her since and asked her why she did this? Or how she expected you to know she had?     NTA", "I think sis knew OP would not agree to watch the child so she \"asked\" in a way OP wouldn't hear and therefore couldn't say no to. She probably assumed that while OP would not hear her asking, she would hear the baby crying and take care of her niece.", "And pays most of the bills. She can't do childcare while she's working - that's a great way to lose your job. Sister needs to be a parent and that means do her own childcare.", "IDK I think I would get my own place now because it happened. \n\nThis isn't the first time the sister \"forgot\" to tap her on the shoulder or whatever, so she knew the rule and left the kid anyway. \n\nThen ripping the headset off while OP is working over something like that is a good way for CPS, police to show up, and get fired. \n\nAlso, kids crawl, roll, and get into crap. Idk if police would've believed the whole but she didn't follow protocol if there was a serious injury or death. \n\nNope nope nope. Immediate move out. \n\nOP NTA but a hotel is better than this situation.", "My husband has something similar, which I\u2019ve borrowed a couple of times, but I don\u2019t like the feeling they give of being completely cut off from the world.

I need to find my headband ear buds lol", "I thought it was an ignoring assumption too. \n\nNTA.", "That's if she even asked. OP not noticing somebody coming into their office space and then the sister asking a question to an unresponsive OP who doesn't even stop doing her work and just leaving after no response is more unlikely, in my mind, than the sister just assuming sister will help when she hears the baby crying and then pretending she asked later when she's in trouble for being a negligent mother.", "Ugh. Reminds me of a post I read on Reddit by a husband who was upstairs with his noise cancelling headphones on while his wife and child were downstairs. There was a break in and unspeakable things were done to wife, and possibly child. (I don't remember all details and may be blocking out the worst parts.) Husband didn't hear anything because of the noise cancelling headphones. Horrifying", "My Apple earbuds are small enough so the shooting muffs easily fit over them.  True story.  My wife bought the shooting muffs for when she was studying for the bar exam.  They do a great job by themselves shutting out noise.  \n\nI added the ear buds so I can listen to music or podcasts.
