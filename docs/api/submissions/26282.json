I cover the majority of rent payments for the house and bills since my sister is not fully back to work yet.

I have told my sister multiple times if she needs anything and I haven't responded to a knock she needs to come into my room and tap me to get my attention otherwise I would simply won't hear her and wouldn't know if she needs anything. However my sister keeps forgetting it.\n\nLast Friday was very hectic at my work so I ended up working 12 hours and had some snacks to get me going. I had no knowledge of my sister asking anything of me since I sit opposite the door I also haven't seen her coming into my room since she didn't tap me on my shoulder as we agreed. Apparently she had to run a few errands at work and had noone to leave my niece with and decided to leave her with me since she would be a few hours. Because I had no idea of her plans and she hasn't followed what I have asked her to do, my niece was left unattended for over 3 hours and was crying her eyes out for god knows how long. I only found out about it when my sister returned home (I was still working and had my headphones on) as she ripped the headphones off my head and started shouting at me and calling me an asshole for not attending to my niece, even I have explained to her I had no idea she was gone or my niece was crying (to add, I don't look at my phone during work hours and after I have checked there was no messages or missed calls from my sister)\n\nI feel really bad about the entire situation, so wanted to check if I am an asshole as my sister still wouldn't talk to me and makes it sound like I did it on purpose.", "created_utc": 1693954291, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16b318x/aita_for_not_looking_after_my_infant_niece_while/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are covering the majority of the bills currently. \n\nYou have a procedure in place that is supposed to be followed when your sister wants you to take care of your niece.  You have explained this procedure to your sister multiple times.\n\nYour sister didn't follow this procedure.  \n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "NTA. You need to move out. You moved in to help your sister out. From your post you are paying most of the rent. At this point you are financially supporting yourself, your sister, and your niece. So being able to focus on your job is extremely important. If you can't pay the bills than who will as it doesn't sound like your sister is able to support herself a 100% right now. Instead of feeling guilt for your sisters error. Move out. Your sister doesn't appreciate your help. She feels entitled to it.", "NTA. Your sister was negligent, then played the UNO reverse card to nail you with the blame because she refuses to accept the very reasonable ground rules you have laid. Sis can either step up and own responsibility for her lack of communication, doing better going forward or the living situation can end.", "This is really bizarre, NTA, this is all on your sister.", "It\u2019s not you! Good lord! Do you think she sincerely cannot remember or does she just walk out thinking you will be forced to step up and take care of your niece? Tell her to get it together or you will move out.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nLemme walk you through this. \n\nYou have explained your work situation to your sister multiple times. Your sister up and left the house and her FIVE MONTH OLD BABY without telling you. \n\nOnly when she gets back and discovers the baby crying is she able to remember the noise canceling headphones. \n\nYou should honestly give her a warning that if she does this again you're out. Or if she does this again you're calling CPS. How incredibly selfish of her.", "NTA - Your sister is negligent. She didn't even seek your agreement before she left. \n\nIf she goes at you again, ask her when did you agree to watch the child? What time did you look at her and tell her it was fine for you to babysit? Or at what time did you text back to say it was ok to watch the child.\n\nYou didn't because she didn't actually ask you. She told you and left before she got an answer. Which is negligent.", "It\u2019s not your fault your sister can\u2019t remember to actually make sure her kid is taken care off. NTA", "NTA - your sister is crazy for leaving without you verbally responding, looking at you or otherwise indicating you've heard her. especially after having conversations about it.", "Absolutely NTA. You are the primary breadwinner of the household and now back up babysitter. You need to work. \n\nYour sister not following  simple instructions to interact with you while you are working is not your fault. Your niece being left unattended is completely on sis. Perhaps it\u2019s time to get your own place again before your current living arrangements messes with your job.", "NTA. I would seriously consider your place there. What would have happened if, god forbid, something happened to your niece? That's what your sister was willing to happen. You want to expose yourself to this?", "NTA.  You clearly didn't visually or verbally acknowledge her request so this is all on her.", "NTA. Your sister is in the wrong. You've given her very clear instructions, which she has ignored.", "NTA. It is not your fault that she cannot grasp the concept of noise, canceling headphones.  Especially since she seem to understand the concept when she returned, and she was angry. If you ask someone to do something and you get no response, you should not assume that they heard you.  Especially when it\u2019s about something as important as a child.", "NTA, seriously, she should have confirmed with you face to face.", "NTA. \n\nSo she popped her head in, said hey you're looking after baby, didn't get a response and then just left? WTF. \n\nYou're working, and therefore not available to care for an infant. Even if she had asked in the manner you requested she's still an AH for expecting you to babysit during work hours. She either takes her baby with her or doesn't do her errands. \n\nYour sister is extremely entitled and mistreating you.", "NTA!!!\nHow were you supposed to know if you didn\u2019t know. It sucks, I feel for the kid but it is your sister\u2019s fault 100%. I wouldn\u2019t leave my kid with someone who didn\u2019t acknowledge me when I asked because I would take that as they either didn\u2019t hear me or don\u2019t want to. Either one is fine because it\u2019s not your kid. I am a mom of a 9month old and this is 100% on the mom. This was not your fault. You didn\u2019t know. Please do not beat yourself up about it. I feel so bad for baby but it was genuinely not your fault at all.", "NTA. This is not your fault in the slightest. If she wants something, she needs to come in, ask, and get verbal confirmation. She knows you can't hear her! She needed to come in and check with you. \n\nAlso, just because you work from home, you aren't available for childcare whenever. She can't just leave the kid with you without getting your approval.", "You are definitely NTA.  You are working (not a baby sitting service).  You were not informed by your sister properly even though she has been told how to properly ask and communicate things.  I\u2019d be moving out asap.  She had the child and it\u2019s her responsibility to look after her child properly and not expect others to do her job.", "No she decided to have a child, if you wanted one, you could probably have one of your own", "YTA for writing this post.\n\nYou say you might not be the asshole for not checking your niece. Why would you on a normal day? \n\nTo you, nothing was out of the ordinary or different that day sister hadn't asked you for anything, you're just at work working. Why would you get up to check on her?", "Doesn't sound very believable. I think you knew she was there and ignored her so YTA.

She needs to get over herself.", "NTA\n\nI am hoping for an update where you confirm that you moved out of your sister's house", "NTA\n\nSo she had the energy to come in and rip your headphones after the fact but not to come in and get verbal confirmation.  This is all on her.", "You have repeatedly told your sister to tap you on the shoulder to get your attention.  She did not do that and instead walked out of the door leaving an infant behind.

She doesn't even talk to you about going on errands and ask you to look after her child you can't read her mind. Maybe this is time to move out.", "I'd start looking for a new place to live.  Basically your sister abandoned her daughter even though it was in her own house.  NTAH here.", "NTA- I\u2019d lock my door from now on, while you\u2019re working. With all the extra help with rent and bills you\u2019re providing, your sis needs to use some of her freed up money on a babysitter, or take her child with her.

You need to move out because she's going to keep treating you like a replacement spouse. I would have told her off back and told her if she ever spoke to me like that again, I'd dip out.", "Yup. This is no different than someone who drops the kids off on the front porch and drives off without even ringing the bell to make sure you're actually home. \n\nCompletely negligent. And honestly I wouldn't be surprised if she did it on purpose-- she knew OP didn't really hear her but left anyway cause she figured it would probably be fine, OP would probably hear the baby if she cried or something, and better to ask forgiveness than permission. \n\nNTA", "I need them for travel! They sound fantastic!", "Right?! I have some pretty expensive Beats noise canceling headphones and I can still hear my son through them if he cries (I get up hours before everyone else to start my work day, I\u2019m not just ignoring my child)", "You really need to move and take care of yourself. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s up with Moms not being able to take their kids on errands. I had twins and no family around. They both went on errands with me. Your sister needs to get a job and daycare at 5 months she should be working and paying her own way", "Seriously her 5 month old probably still eats around the clock. If she fed the baby right before she left being gone for just three hours thats cutting it pretty close. If the baby was screaming that long it was probably hungry or needed to be changed. What if that baby had rolled over and suffocated? All it takes is a few minutes of squirming around on pillows and blankets (unsafe for sleep) for something to obstruct a baby's airway. I would also call CPS if that happened again. Her sister is lucky nothing bad happened other than a few hours of neglect.", "That's exactly what I was thinking.  God forbid something happen. You know mom isn't going to take the blame. OP would be looking at charges. \n\nShe has shown her hand.... Make it clear ... in wrighting ... during work hours, you are never available to watch the child.   \nEnforce it. Otherwise next time it may not all end well.", "When my babes were little, I'd schlep them with me to run errands. A five-month-old fits nicely in a carseat, then pops into a wearable baby pouch. In this way, I could breastfeed them as needed.", "First of all\u2026 if she heard the baby crying and didn\u2019t know her sister left then why would she go check on the kid when the primary caretaker is there? It\u2019s not her kid and it\u2019s not like she\u2019d know more than the actual mom. This is 100% on mom, who the fuck leaves their kid with out hearing confirmation that the person knows to care for the kid.", "Honest points for the \"not just\""]}
