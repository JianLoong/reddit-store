She decided to tell me this on the day she had to leave. I let her know I\u2019d appreciate it if she told me this in advance instead of on the day she left for a week.\n\nShe promised me that she would make sure that she would tell me these sort of things the moment she knew she had to go abroad or at least a week in advance.\n\nIn her third year she had to go abroad for a week again due to another school-project. She again decided to tell me this a day before she had to leave. I got annoyed and reminded her of her promise, she apologized and made the same promise again and that was it.\n\nTomorrow, she had to go abroad for a week, for yet another school-project. She told me that today, and since it\u2019s the third time that\u2019s happened I snapped at her.\n\nShe told me that I am a controlling asshole, and I nastily told her she should learn how to communicate and how to keep a promise.

Like if she gave you heads up, you might try to take time off and go with her. Maybe she is doing extra-curricular activities that she doesn't want you there for.", "NTA\n\nShe is. After promising you twice and her knowing how deeply you felt about this promise; she should have known better. She failed you, twice. So it's completely normal to snap- unless you're a saint.", "NTA.  Late notice on most things is annoying and worthy of a discussion.  Multiple late notice of weeklong trips when you are in a serious relationship (and possibly live together-OP doesn't actually confirm this) is exceptionally disrespectful.  She is showing that she doesn't care that it bothers you.  Also, her saying you are a controlling asshole is a classic gaslighting response that is indicative of narcissistic personality disorder.  She is taking HER failure to be a considerate partner and calling it YOUR character flaw.  It's not.", "You can\u2019t be a controlling AH. You don\u2019t know where she\u2019s going, who\u2019s she visiting, what the trip is for, etc. \n\nShe is manipulating and gaslighting you into thinking you\u2019re controlling so she can continue do do whatever she wants. NTA. And be careful. I wouldn\u2019t just trust somebody who can easily be forthcoming but repeatedly chooses not to", "NTA, insanely disrespectful and inconsiderate of her to not keep you in the loop. not controlling, and she seems unable to communicate. would watch out if you are looking to move forward in the relationship.", "INFO:  Is she going to the same place abroad that she has been going to?  Or have they all been different locations?\n\nI'm just wondering if she has a side piece that she isn't telling you about.  The fact that she isn't telling you upfront when she knows, to me, is a red flag.  Because now you can't ask her about it because she's already gone.  Does she post on social media when she's there?  If she doesn't, then again a red flag.", "NTA. First time it happened, fine a mistake. Second time it happened, mighty dumb but still understandable. Third time it happened, nah bro she's just doing this intentionally at this point. I don't remember who said this but i quote \"Somebody who repeats the same mistake the third time is not a human, but a monkey.\".", "You have more patience than me, I would have dumped her the second time. Blocked her while she was abroad and let her figure out what she did.", "NTA\n\nIt's reasonable to want some notice if your girlfriend is going to be gone for a week, if only so you can make plans around that fact. It's also weird to me that she wouldn't mention it sooner. I don't know how far \"going abroad\" is where you are, but trips of any significant distance and length take planning well ahead of time, especially if there's study or research involved. So if you talk regularly, it seems like it would come up in conversation that she was getting school work done ahead of time, getting someone to water her plants while she's gone, shopping for clothing for a different climate maybe. It just seems weird not to tell you before the day before she leaves.", "nta you asked her to communicate important information with you (leaving the country is kind of a big deal) and she failed to do so. why wouldn\u2019t she tell you when she found out about the trip? its very strange that she\u2019s telling you day before or day of, and begs the question of whether she thinks you\u2019re important enough to be in the know. which you should be, because I assume the two of you talk every day.\n\nhowever, yelling at her doesn\u2019t make sense and isn\u2019t okay", "NTA - she should have told you as as she knew", "Hum this stinks like you know what not sure I would stay in a relationship where someone is blatantly disrespectful!!!!", "NTA - are you sure you\u2019re her only boyfriend?", "NTA..\n\n3 times is a habit.", "NTA something is rather off about that. Why is she waiting until last minute for such major things and getting upset when SHE messes up. Maybe she is waiting so you can\u2019t try to tag along and she what she\u2019s doing on the trips?", "NTA\n\nBut personally, I would be mighty pissed for being called controlling for wanting a simple heads-up.\n\nI might have read too much reddit, but whenever a person claims abusive behavior over something so decidedly benign as wanting to know about major trips *ahead* of time, it's usually because they *DON'T* want you to look too closely at what they're doing.", "Info: What notice did she have that she would need to take a trip? Do you live together? Is there a reason you need to know more than a few days ahead that she is going for a school trip?", "While you shouldn't have snapped at her, she is still the asshole in this situation. She knew, and she refused to tell you until the day of/before. From the limited information you've given, you don't seem manipulative. You were angry for a good reason, but being a dick because she was a dick doesn't solve anything.", "\nIt's always been my belief that your other half should be the first thing you think of when something cool is about to happen, like going abroad for school. Maybe I'm just delusional.  Maybe she simply doesn't think about you all that much.  Either way, it's depressing.", "Oof. I'd be pissed too. Maybe not so much about the trips, but the fact she can't keep a simple promise. But also, don't let anger control how you respond. It only escalates things.", "ESH:  You for yelling and her for being inconsiderate.  I could not imagine personally going away for a week and only informing my partner the day before.", "Hard to say, but i'll go ESH : 3 times through 4 years is more or less \"tolerable\" but making a promise and not keeping it, two times, tells a lot about the lack of commitment.\n\nBut surely you could have gone about it better than straight yelling at her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was delaying the inevitable feelers betwen you two but not a good solution. She likely wanted things to be as normal as possible and deal with the fallout. It's not a good scene because depending on how you acted, you could be giving her all the justification she would need to entirely discount your feelings with her actions abroad. Dont know her and wouldn't want to assume that was her intention. Lesser folks have done it, made the other person the baddy by putting them in a situation to react and using a poor reaction to justify doing whatever they want. Perhaps she didn't want to be accountable to you or felt that you'd have feelings that would make her feel as if she was controlled or needed to control herself on behalf of a relationship. She knew there was a chance to need to go abroad since the moment she saw the syllabus.", "NTA\n\nThink of it this way... she was hiding the fact that she was going way from you. That's not nice.", "NTA\n\nShe is disrespectful af for that. There is no reason to not tell you about the trip well before the day before. Wanting to know a week in advance is not controlling, it's common courtesy. Especially after being together for over 3 years.", "NTA \n\nWho doesn\u2019t tell their significant other the shit that\u2019s going on in their life. Why so secretive.. weird", "NTA it's really weird how this wouldn't come up in conversation at some point.", "It is, common excuses are \u201cI forgot to tell you\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal\u201d or \u201cI thought I told you\u201d", "This is what I was thinking too.

The trips are not the issue and nothing to be suspicious about.", "But he doesn't have any proof for that?  Or does he?", "Yeah that\u2019s why I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the asshole for this. I want to move out within 2 years, but I feel communication is key in making that work and this does not really make me believe that will work..", "They are different locations and she does text and send pictures when she\u2019s there. The trips and cheating aren\u2019t an issue.", "This crossed my mind, but I\u2019m not that kind of person, and apparently really patient.", "Because that's really mature.", "She does not plan the trips themselves her school does, but apparently she has known for 3 weeks now. \nWe do talk every day but I don\u2019t ask her \u201cdo you have any trips coming up\u201d because I expect her to keep her promise, so it doesn\u2019t organically come up in conversation.", "That\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the asshole.", "Well I hope so!\nBut in all seriousness loyalty is not the issue.", "Well they are school-trips, and I work fulltime, ao I wouldn\u2019t be able to tag along even if she told me in advance.

But you\u2019re right, I could\u2019ve handled it much better.", "How was HE inconsiderate?", "Well no, but his has been the major issue for me for the past 3 years, which somehow cannot be fixed.\nShe is studying to become a pre-school teacher, her trip for tomorrow is about going to England and visiting school, I did also express that I personally did not see how that would help her in teaching in her home country since the whole education system is different, but I also mentioned she should go because it could be very interesting and fun. That happened after I snapped and after I calmed down though.", "It might be that she has high-functioning ADHD? That would mean she's not lying.", "No proof, but it's very suspicious.", "Honestly, her trips sound fishy as hell. What class is she taking the requires multiple week-long trips for school projects? Professors give a syllabus at the beginning of the semester that details all the class work for that semester. So, if she really is doing this for class, she's known since the beginning of the semester, which means she REALLY had time to tell you in advance. And what kind of school project requires traveling abroad? That is so too involved for a class project. I would dig deeper because the math ain't mathing.", "Not gunna be blatantly disrespected like that.", "What, communication isn\u2019t important in relationships anymore?

I can't see needing to travel to England three times for learning to be a pre-school teacher, especially for one week increments. What are you going to learn in a couple of days. My bet is that the trips are for something different and that is the reason for the secrecy and springing it on you last minute.", "She does not. It\u2019s been tested.\nAlso she rarely forgets anything when it\u2019s not regarding me or telling me something. These excuses only come forth when in a situation as described in the post.", "The trips are fine, the fact you don\u2019t know everything for the whole year is pretty normal in the Netherlands, normally you know what\u2019s happening for the first 3/4 weeks, and after that the other 3/4 weeks.\nPretty standard here. She is studying to become a pre-school teacher and the trips are aimed at broadening knowledge about other countries/education systems (I\u2019m guessing). So the trips are fine.", "You can communicate but this happens routinely so he should just be chill about it and also she doesn\u2019t have to tell him stuff weeks in advance.

Yelling could be characterized as an overreaction (although I'm not sure I agree with that) but it is definitely not inconsiderate.", "I\u2019m 100% she is traveling for school. Not all three trips were to England, and she does text and send pictures when she\u2019s away, so that\u2019s not the issue.", "So breaking promises is cool is it?", "I guess you misundertood. \n\nEveryone sucks here: You for yelling(op is an asshole for yelling) and her for being inconisiderate(she's is an asshole for being inconsiderate).
