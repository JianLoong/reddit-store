So me and my mom work fulltime and my dad never does anything. We don\u2019t have much time for household let alone laundry. Laundry is only done when we have days off and that\u2019s only 1/2 times a week. So X has been staying with us for a while now which I\u2019m not happy about but whatever. She just asked me when can you or your mom do laundry. I told her we only do laundry when we have days off and that\u2019s not today. She said it\u2019s urgent so I told her \u201cI\u2019m assuming you know how a washing machine works since you lived on your own as well so if it\u2019s urgent you are welcome to do your own laundry\u201d. I told her she doesn\u2019t have to do ours but if it\u2019s urgents she shouldn\u2019t expect us to just do things differently. She told me I\u2019m an huge AH for not thinking about her or her son and she talked about how difficult it already is to be a single mother. I told her she isn\u2019t even helping with household or cooking or anything like that and she lives at our home rent free and doesn\u2019t pay groceries.  So if she has an urgent matter with washing clothes she can do it herself.

Lots of Women are Single Moms. Lots of Men are Single Dads. They don't have someone to do their laundry or household and cook meals.\n\nDon't do anything for her OP.

I would have gone off a long time ago. She\u2019s not paying rent?!? Then she better clean and cook (every once in a while) and help with laundry. Laundry is the easiest thing to do. You put clothes in the washer and turn on. Done. Come back put clothes in dryer and turn on. Come back. Clothes is magically washed. She\u2019s an entitled freeloader. NTA.", "NTA.  If she was actually terribly busy and couldn\u2019t manage her laundry, it would\u2019ve been her responsibility to ask nicely for help and coordinate with whoever was doing it, so she would know when it\u2019d be washed and where she should leave her (sorted) laundry.

(In my opinion, of course)  It takes a couple minutes to put it in the washer, and then 45 minutes later you move it to the dryer or drying racks.   It's a blessed break from the tyranny of keeping the kitchen clean.", "NTA.

Laundry isn't even a hard chore and there's no reason for an able-bodied adult to expect someone else to do theirs for them.", "I'm going to make some assumptions.\n\n1. Her baby is not special needs.\n2. She is not working more than 40 hrs a week/working going to school.\n3. She actually has used a washer and dryer before.\n\nIf these are all true then definitely NTA.\n\nThere is a sliding scale for the rest.
