Hand it in and let them swim in their pool of consequences. I have no idea if this is high school or uni or whatever, but if all of you are aged 15+, and that's what it sounds like, school of any sort is to prep you for the real world... and the real world has consequences. You've already asked them multiple times. Worry about you; hand in your project. Bask in your success. And don't worry about them because, hopefully, you'll also learn something here -- these are the sorts of people you won't voluntarily work with in the future.\n\nAnd, trust me, the teacher understands all of this very well. They've seen it a thousand times. They see it multiple times, every time they assign group projects.", "NTA. Turn it in. Let natural consequences run their course.", "NTA. They know when stuff is due, they aren\u2019t engaging. Do your thing.", "Eh.... Not exactly the asshole. Tell them, then fuck em. Get what you need to done, don't be a snitch, and just let the reality unfold. \n\nThis happened to me for a senior thesis in college. Two of us tried everything to get the third party to participate, and by the time everything needed to be buttoned up, we gave him the easiest part - an anatomy discussion. Like wikipedia shit, but before wikipedia (there was this place called a library with all these paper bricks with facts and shit in it). Anyway, guy did nothing, and we just sort of let it happen during the thesis defense, jumping in to demonstrate we knew what was up, but not enough to cover.\n\nWas that right? Who cares. We tried really hard for inclusion and the *bare minimum* of performance expectations, and were not interested in failing ourselves.", "Ethically speaking, it's always good to give people a chance to correct their course. However, you've already attempted to engage them multiple times with no success. So, it's not like you haven't tried. If you decide to tell them, it could be a wake up call for them to contribute, even if it's last minute. If you choose not to, consider it a tough love lesson in responsibility and consequences. Either way, you're NTA. You did the work, and sometimes that's just how group projects go.", "The only one I would give a heads up is the sick girl", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You already set the stage for them to get graded negatively and while it would feel like a small bit of justice you don\u2019t know what everyone has going on in their lives. \n\nI guess ask yourself if feeling like you were right and you\u2019re vindicated is worth a classmate not graduating on time and accruing more debt?
