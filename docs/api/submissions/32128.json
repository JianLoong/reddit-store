Your roommate is unhinged.", "NTA. To raise the rent by $300 a month you must have a yard the size of a public park. Find a place of your own or get another roommate.", "NTA This is all on her. She wanted the yard and all the responsibilities that come with it. She can\u2019t arbitrarily increase your rent. It looks like she\u2018s going to be living la vida lawn care next year.", "Why are you still living with her", "NTA\n\nSo to my understanding she is renting a house where it appears she has a deal with the landlord that the yard work is done by her. Probably for a discount on her rent. Now she wants to increase your rent by 300.......  while she pays for the lawn service on your dime and keeps her rent cheap. Ridiculous", "NTA. It is time to move though. Make sure you have a written agreement even if you are rooming with a friend", "First of all how big is your lawn that this is even an issue? Just mow it?", "nta. move back out. yard work aside, if holding her to her word makes her scream and slam doors she is not someone you should live with.", "NTA  It's time to move if you haven't figured that out by now!", "NTA\n\nYour friend wanted to live in the house, and so agreed that she would take care of all the lawn care costs. This was part of the agreement that you had to move in together - you'd split the rent, but she would pay lawn care costs.\n\nNow it seems like she wants to change the agreement, because she doesn't like the old agreement. That's too bad for her - at least for the duration of the current agreement.\n\nBut she's free to renegotiate for next year. Effectively, she is telling you that she is no longer willing to share with you on the basis that you pay half the rent each and she pays all the lawncare. That's OK. But you're not willing to share with her on the basis that you each pay half the rent and each pay half the lawncare, so it looks like you won't be living together next year.", "Growing up is hard.
