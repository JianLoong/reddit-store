Your roommate is unhinged.", "NTA. To raise the rent by $300 a month you must have a yard the size of a public park. Find a place of your own or get another roommate.", "NTA This is all on her. She wanted the yard and all the responsibilities that come with it. She can\u2019t arbitrarily increase your rent. It looks like she\u2018s going to be living la vida lawn care next year.", "Why are you still living with her", "NTA\n\nSo to my understanding she is renting a house where it appears she has a deal with the landlord that the yard work is done by her. Probably for a discount on her rent. Now she wants to increase your rent by 300.......  while she pays for the lawn service on your dime and keeps her rent cheap. Ridiculous", "NTA. It is time to move though. Make sure you have a written agreement even if you are rooming with a friend", "First of all how big is your lawn that this is even an issue? Just mow it?", "nta. move back out. yard work aside, if holding her to her word makes her scream and slam doors she is not someone you should live with.", "NTA  It's time to move if you haven't figured that out by now!", "NTA\n\nYour friend wanted to live in the house, and so agreed that she would take care of all the lawn care costs. This was part of the agreement that you had to move in together - you'd split the rent, but she would pay lawn care costs.\n\nNow it seems like she wants to change the agreement, because she doesn't like the old agreement. That's too bad for her - at least for the duration of the current agreement.\n\nBut she's free to renegotiate for next year. Effectively, she is telling you that she is no longer willing to share with you on the basis that you pay half the rent each and she pays all the lawncare. That's OK. But you're not willing to share with her on the basis that you each pay half the rent and each pay half the lawncare, so it looks like you won't be living together next year.", "Growing up is hard. She\u2019s learning something the hard way. Stand firm. \n\nAlso maybe look for a new place to live.", "\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06", "No one caught the roommate moving some \"random homeless person\" IN WITH THEM????? That right there was when I'd move out. I'm sure there are wonderful homeless people but moving ANYONE else into the home to do the yardwork is insane?", "Presumably you're not on the lease as she can 'up' your rent. Start looking for a new place, yesterday. She's not your friend. NTA", "NTA Are you sure your friend isn\u2019t five? Because screaming at the top of her lungs and slamming doors is a five year old\u2019s temper tramtrum.", "NTA She sounds delightful.", "NTA. A deal\u2019s a deal. If she can\u2019t honor her end, that\u2019s on her to figure out.\n\nYou need to move out.\n\nAlso, on what planet does yard maintenance for a single-family home cost $600 per month? I assume she\u2019s responsible for half the cost because she should be (assuming there was no prior agreement, which there was, so this is hypothetical), and that\u2019s why she\u2019s charging you $300. Even $300/month is excessive. I pay $30/week ($120/month) to have the yard mowed, and about $300-400/year to have the grass fertilized and weeded. Maybe I\u2019m getting a great deal. I know some people pay $40-50/week, but even that\u2019s only about $200/month.\n\nIt sounds like she is trying to make a little extra cash on the side by not only forcing you to pay for all the yard care but also additional, unnecessary fees that will go right into her pocket.\n\nAgain, you need to move out. She\u2019s scamming you to solve *her* problems.", "NTA, and you might seriously start looking for a new place to live.", "NTA. She sounds mentally unstable, might have to have her welfare checked repeatedly until the issues work themselves out.", "Sounds like a really helpful, stable, and friendly situation you've gotten yourself into.\n\nMove.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Move out and let this drama queen deal by herself.  She's not your friend.  There are some serious issues here.  Moving a homeless man in with you?  What?  Increasing your rent?  Yelling?  Red flags.", "NTA\n\nShe romatized yard work until she actually had to do it. \n\nMy husband did the same. Waxed lyric ally about his experience with irrigation and how much he loved it. Now he lets the yard get to the point where the city sends notices before he addresses it.  I told him up front I was never up for yard work but he wanted This House so it is on him.  I even offered to pay for a gardener if he did the work to find one. \n\n10 years here, no gardener and he works on the yard maybe 8 days a year. Just waiting for the next notice from the city as the front is so overgrown you can barely see the house.", "NTA\n\n1. You don't live in the type of property you want to live in.\n2. You had to live with a random homeless person for 4 months\n3. You were forced into doing some work that you had explicitly wanted to avoid by living in an apartment\n4. You're being told your rent will increase by $300/mo next year (No landscaping anywhere costs $300/mo)\n5. Your roommate thinks it's ok to slam doors and scream as part of problem solving\n\nPlease stop living at that place and with that person.", "NTA\n\nShe said she would take care of it and messed up... move out and move on", "300 a month?!", "Are YOU gonna live with her tantrums?

Between going back on her word and throwing temper tantrums, it\u2019s best to try to seek whatever alternative living arrangement is possible.", "Where I live, in a HCOL area, $100/month will pay for a landscaper to do his thing. We do have to pay for snow removal though, which is a different set of charges.", "I personally would have moved out the day a random homeless person moved in.", "I think OP is just referring to allowing a homeless person life in the yard. I could be wrong, but that is how I interpreted it with the sarcastic use of \"solution\".", "Like there's no way of knowing anything about this person and they just were let into the home??", "You forgot moving in random homeless guy", "That alone would scare me out of that house."]}
