Your roommate is unhinged.", "NTA. To raise the rent by $300 a month you must have a yard the size of a public park. Find a place of your own or get another roommate.", "NTA This is all on her. She wanted the yard and all the responsibilities that come with it. She can\u2019t arbitrarily increase your rent. It looks like she\u2018s going to be living la vida lawn care next year.", "Why are you still living with her", "NTA\n\nSo to my understanding she is renting a house where it appears she has a deal with the landlord that the yard work is done by her. Probably for a discount on her rent. Now she wants to increase your rent by 300.......  while she pays for the lawn service on your dime and keeps her rent cheap. Ridiculous", "NTA. It is time to move though. Make sure you have a written agreement even if you are rooming with a friend", "First of all how big is your lawn that this is even an issue? Just mow it?", "nta. move back out. yard work aside, if holding her to her word makes her scream and slam doors she is not someone you should live with.", "NTA  It's time to move if you haven't figured that out by now!", "NTA\n\nYour friend wanted to live in the house, and so agreed that she would take care of all the lawn care costs. This was part of the agreement that you had to move in together - you'd split the rent, but she would pay lawn care costs.\n\nNow it seems like she wants to change the agreement, because she doesn't like the old agreement. That's too bad for her - at least for the duration of the current agreement.\n\nBut she's free to renegotiate for next year. Effectively, she is telling you that she is no longer willing to share with you on the basis that you pay half the rent each and she pays all the lawncare. That's OK. But you're not willing to share with her on the basis that you each pay half the rent and each pay half the lawncare, so it looks like you won't be living together next year.", "Growing up is hard. She\u2019s learning something the hard way. Stand firm. \n\nAlso maybe look for a new place to live.", "\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06", "No one caught the roommate moving some \"random homeless person\" IN WITH THEM????? That right there was when I'd move out.

Start looking for a new place, yesterday. She's not your friend. NTA", "NTA Are you sure your friend isn\u2019t five? Because screaming at the top of her lungs and slamming doors is a five year old\u2019s temper tramtrum.", "NTA She sounds delightful.", "NTA. A deal\u2019s a deal. If she can\u2019t honor her end, that\u2019s on her to figure out.\n\nYou need to move out.\n\nAlso, on what planet does yard maintenance for a single-family home cost $600 per month? I assume she\u2019s responsible for half the cost because she should be (assuming there was no prior agreement, which there was, so this is hypothetical), and that\u2019s why she\u2019s charging you $300. Even $300/month is excessive. I pay $30/week ($120/month) to have the yard mowed, and about $300-400/year to have the grass fertilized and weeded. Maybe I\u2019m getting a great deal. I know some people pay $40-50/week, but even that\u2019s only about $200/month.\n\nIt sounds like she is trying to make a little extra cash on the side by not only forcing you to pay for all the yard care but also additional, unnecessary fees that will go right into her pocket.\n\nAgain, you need to move out. She\u2019s scamming you to solve *her* problems.", "NTA, and you might seriously start looking for a new place to live.", "NTA. She sounds mentally unstable, might have to have her welfare checked repeatedly until the issues work themselves out.", "Sounds like a really helpful, stable, and friendly situation you've gotten yourself into.\n\nMove.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Move out and let this drama queen deal by herself.  She's not your friend.  There are some serious issues here.  Moving a homeless man in with you?  What?  Increasing your rent?  Yelling?  Red flags.", "NTA\n\nShe romatized yard work until she actually had to do it. \n\nMy husband did the same. Waxed lyric ally about his experience with irrigation and how much he loved it. Now he lets the yard get to the point where the city sends notices before he addresses it.  I told him up front I was never up for yard work but he wanted This House so it is on him.  I even offered to pay for a gardener if he did the work to find one. \n\n10 years here, no gardener and he works on the yard maybe 8 days a year. Just waiting for the next notice from the city as the front is so overgrown you can barely see the house.", "NTA\n\n1. You don't live in the type of property you want to live in.\n2. You had to live with a random homeless person for 4 months\n3. You were forced into doing some work that you had explicitly wanted to avoid by living in an apartment\n4.

Best would be a proper registered agreement.", "Ours is that expensive, but we have a two acre yard.", "Sounds like a kid who asked for a dog and promised to take care of it and didn't fully realize exactly what it would entail.", "I'm MCOL and we pay $2500 for a season for just mowing and weed eating. It's cut weekly at the height of the season and sometimes could use 2. So that's about $400 a month for us. Seems like that's too much? Well, no, not really because we're on 4 acres, we didn't have to buy a new tractor, we have more time to ourselves and we're not responsible for maintaining equipment.", "I just can't get my head around this. Lawn care costs? WTAF is that?\n\nI had a house for 18 years with a front lawn and a back garden. I was a lazy gardener at best - I'd sometimes plant veg, but rarely look after it well enough to actually harvest anything. I had a few pretty plants that would flower, and daffodil bulbs along one edge. But the grass - I had a cheap lawn mower, a strimmer, a hose, a weed puller and some grass seed. Total cost for that was less than $200. And then I'd go out, once a month or so, pull the worst weeds, mow the grass, edge with the strimmer, job done. If anything bad happened, a bit more time with the weed puller and add some grass seed.\n\nIf it's a big yard, get a bigger/better lawn mower, but it's still not a big job. One Sunday morning a month at most. If it's a normal size, like 100 square yards, it's an hour and a half, tops. In winter, nothing grows, so no work at all. So like 7-9 days, total 15-20 hours work a year.", "Yeah my last roommate (19f) asked me if this dude, that she had just met because he knocked on our door randomly, could stay with us for a couple days. I said I\u2019d (33f) like to meet him first and then I would make my decision. So he came back, (they had swapped numbers earlier) and he seemed like an ok person and I hate the thought of not doing what I can to help people if I have the means. So I was like, he can stay for a couple days after he offered to give us $200 (after he got paid of course). What my roommate didn\u2019t tell me, was that she was leaving that same day to go home for the holiday, and would be gone for over a week. He was fine for a couple days, I took him to the Walmart down the road and spent maybe $30 for him to get some clean underwear and some simple food stuff, so he wouldn\u2019t be eating all of our food. When he got paid, I asked him when he was going to transfer the money, and he was like, yeah, it\u2019s like $5 right? I was like, um, no you said you would give us $200? He started throwing a fit and said something along the lines of, if you\u2019re going to be like that, I should just pack my shit and leave. So I was like, go for it bro. I\u2019m not gonna stop you. So he did. Also, he was supposed to be sleeping on the couch, but I woke up one morning and he was sleeping in my roommates room. He claimed that he had permission from her. So when he was leaving, I told him that I didn\u2019t believe that he had permission to be in her room at all, (I didn\u2019t ask her because we barely got along) and he started taking pictures of her room saying he thought I would trash her room and say he did it because he knew we didn\u2019t get along that well. I tried to get him to delete the pictures, but didn\u2019t really feel safe doing it (I\u2019m disabled). He finally left and then about an hour later, I got a text from my roommate that he told her that I kicked him out and she wanted to hear my side. I told her what happened and she said she was glad he was gone before she got back because he was making her uncomfortable. I was like, wtf didn\u2019t you say anything and WTF did you ask if he could stay and then leave without even telling me?!? The random dude told me that she had went back home. She apologized and started crying and all that shit and I was like, you put me in an unsafe situation. The only reason I said yes to begin with was because I thought both of us would be here while he was here. It was wild.", "where tf do you live that lawn maintenance is a once-a-month (at MOST) task??? where i live if i don't cut it biweekly or even weekly in the hotter months it gets out of control. yeah it doesn't have to get cut in the wintertime but still \ud83d\ude2d", "I had a roommate do that when I was out of town on vacation. I moved out the next day.", "That sounds really scary. Even if the guy was all good, he was still an absolute stranger. Leaving you alone with him was a really bad thing to do on your friend's part.", "I was thinking the same thing.  Biweekly maybe here in MO, but back in FL it was three times in 2 weeks during the summer months unless under a severe drought.  At $60/cut, and allowing for the rest of the year, that still only comes out to $190/mo.\n\nIf this house is in an HOA, then all bets are off.", "Oh she\u2019s not my friend. She was an absolute brat. I was as nice as I could be while she was here. I was raised in Alabama so all that southern hospitality lol I even took her to a concert for free because I didn\u2019t want to go alone and thought she would enjoy it. (I get tickets from vettix.org, so I get 4 tickets for $15 total). But she did a complete 180 after moving in and starting being a real witch to me for no apparent reason. I knew having a younger roommate wasn\u2019t ideal, but no one else responded to my messages (my college doesn\u2019t have campus housing so they send out a list of people looking for roommates with a short bio).", "Trust me, I learnt it the hard way, being too nice only allows people to take you for granted. Don't leave your good qualities of being respectful and polite but learn to say a firm NO when you are uncomfirtable with something. There may be some cribbing at that time but it will save you a lot of trouble in the long run."]}
