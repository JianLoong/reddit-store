They all can't feed the baby either.  \n\nLet the sister inlaw sulk for no reason.", "NTA, not like any cis female could just do it either unless they were lactating.", "telling someone to chill out/calm down has never in fact helped someone chill out or calm down. \n\nSIL did overreact, even if she were AFAB unless she were actively lactating your mom's comment would still have been accurate . \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nYour SIL (transgender or not) does not have the boobs your baby was seeking. That's not an insult, it's just a fact.", "No nta", "NTA. It had nothing to do with her transition. However, she's not lactating. That'd be the case if any other female was also there.", "Why would you be TA?  Your morher made the comment at issue.", "NTA. The only one lactating and able to feed the baby was the baby\u2019s mom\u2026simple fact.", "NAH\n\nAssuming that your mom didn't intend this as a dig (which it sounds like it wasn't), then there wasn't anything wrong with the comment. It's not a comment on womanhood, just lactation.\n\nThat said, it's completely possible that SIL, realizing that they likely won't ever be able to lactate without some sort of external/hormonal/surgical influence, got pretty emotional and was having a lot of feelings\n\nIt's no one's fault, but just remember to be empathetic to their situation. If you start going around telling people \"hey you don't have a right to be upset about this,\" that does start to venture into A H terriroty", "Nta! Your mother, a biological female, included herself in that comment.", "NTA. Truly nobody cis or trans could breastfeed the daughter other than the child\u2019s mother. You also didn\u2019t say it you were only trying to help the situation.", "Nta\n\nThey sound like the type that looks to get offended.", "NTA for explaining that it wasn\u2019t targeted at her. But for what it\u2019s worth it\u2019s possible your SIL is struggling with how things like motherhood may look different for her in the future given that she is transgender, so you may need to be a bit sensitive to those feelings sometimes. But in this situation she did overreact.", "NAH\n\nThere's literally no conflict here.", "Totally NTA", "NTA. Maybe it was a dig at her, but she could not feed the child, exactly like all people present except the child\u2019s mother.", "Assuming mom doesn't have a history of making unkind or underhanded remarks toward SIL, it does seem like an overreaction. Likely a sensitive subject for her. NAH but life tip, telling someone who is upset to \"chill out\" never gets a positive response.", "NTA. Your SIL is too much drama looking for attention.", "I don\u2019t think it was the right comment at the right time if that makes sense. Instead of reaching to protect your mom, your SIL needed support at the time especially since there is currently a war on her very existence. NTA, but you could have handled it better. The way you handled it probably felt very dismissive to her. Take a beat. Calm down. Talk later.", "INFO: How old are you?  How often has telling someone who's already crying that they \"needed to chill out\" worked out for you?\n\nObviously some big emotions at play, but that's a boneheaded thing to say.  If you want to help, say \"Hey, I'd like some air.  Want to keep me company?\" and take her out for a breather.", "INFO - how was she \"infuriated\"? Did she say anything angry or was she just upset and left?\n\nBig differences in judgement may depend on exactly what SIL said/did before you told her to \"chill out\".", "When in the history of ever, has a person calmed down because someone told them to? \n\nSoft YTA for that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Breasts don't just miraculously produce milk just because there's a baby .", "Her Mom made the remark.  As you point out, her Mom couldn\u2019t nurse the child either so the only point of the remark would be to make a little dig at SIL. Sure SIL was too sensitive, but it would be better to ask SIL why she was upset than to tell her she was wrong to be so. Better to listen to other\u2019s feelings than to dictate what feelings they are allowed to have.", "NTA \"These are not the boobs you are looking for\"", "Because I told her to chill out, I guess I worry that I didn\u2019t approach it properly", "anyone lactating *can* feed anyone that latches. Wet nurses are a thing, people sell breast milk. Babies dgaf whose boob they're latched to as long as there's flow. \n\nnone of that is to say SIL reacted reasonably, simply that the statement \"nobody cis or trans could breastfeed the daughter other than the child\u2019s mother.\" in inaccurate.", "This makes sense. I appreciate your response. My side of the family (and hers) has totally adopted and have not had any problems using her preferred pronouns and never dead name her, so this came as a surprise.", "May? Or maybe she will be gestating an infant and breastfeeding?", "Nah it wasn\u2019t an intended dig, my mother is very supportive and have taken her out on shopping dates and whatnot where they pick out certain era-themed dress outfits from Goodwill\u2026lol, I don\u2019t really get it\u2026 but they both seem to love it and have a good time lol", "No, no history of unkind or underhand remarks toward her. In fact, she\u2019s actually bought her a few dresses.", "A war at her very existence? What does that mean?", "That sounds a lot like dumbing things down for a grown adult.", "She just got real quiet and started to \u201cstew\u201d\u2026if that makes sense? That\u2019s when I approached her and offered to get her some water or a beverage and talk about it.", "That\u2019s fair. I guess given the relationship that her and my mom had I thought it would have been realized it wasn\u2019t a diss, so that\u2019s why I resorted to the relax comment of \u201cchill out.\u201d \n\nThanks for your feedback.", "It\u2019s more like \u201cnone of the boobs at this table are the ones you need\u201d\u2026 the comment had nothing to do with SIL", "I said that exact phrase to my \"nieces\" all the time when they were being breastfed.", "Nah you\u2019re fine.  She was just upset by what her mom said.  I\u2019d stay out of it, probably thorny subject.  Btw, probs for being role.  Most of the shit on this sub is fake and written by a small group who use burner accounts.", "Have you read the news about how trans people are being treated in this county by any chance?", "Pretty sure they mean the way the entire world seems to be anti-trans at the moment. Many countries around the world are passing laws that are very much guided by transphobic rhetoric, basically \u201cwaging war\u201d on those who feel a disconnect with their gender assigned at birth.", "I am talking about the political culture wars that are resulting in numerous anti-trans laws. And, in spite of what people think, there are many states that are trying to ban gender affirming care for adults, too. This may be the most hostile time ever for her as a transgender woman. So, that\u2019s what I meant and you can\u2019t expect her not to feel like every comment that she feels is even slightly questioning her existence and what it means to be a woman, e.g. breastfeeding, is another attack on her person. That\u2019s why I said she needed empathy in that moment and it may have felt like you were being dismissive. It was triggering for because of what is going on in the world.", "Commenter is referring to all the negative backlash in society regarding transgender rights and discrimination.\n\nTheir very existence is considered wrong in a lot of circles and they are hated on and hate crimes for being trans.", "Maybe so, but it seems like you needed it explained that way.", "I think NAH\n\nShe was quietly upset by a comment that wasn't personal, but must have felt hurtful in some way. I mean, maybe she's struggling with the idea that if she becomes a mum one day, it won't be in the traditional way and she will miss out on experiences like breastfeeding. That could be hard to deal with.\n\nIn the same way that people dealing with infertility can find it hard to feel joyful about other people's baby journeys, I can't really say your SIL is an AH just for being sad, and leaving the party.\n\nYou're not an AH for asking her to stay, even if your comment is perhaps a bit insensitive to her pain. After all, nobody actually was having a dig at her.", "Have you read the context of the thread by any chance?", "Lol okay buddy", "This right here. She was just feeling her feelings in private none the less. If she is actively taking hormone therapy that is another reason that she may have felt a little upset. OP shouldn't have said chill out. He could have asked if she was ok and tried to comfort her a little or something.", "Ok, I\u2019ll dumb it down. There is a war against your SIL\u2019s existence because trans people are losing protections legally all across the county. You asked what \u201ca war against her existence\u201d meant.", "Real snarky. And that\u2019s nothing that my family has done, said, or alluded toward."]}
