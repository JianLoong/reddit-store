From all the details written, I can kinda understand where Brynn is coming from seeing that I have just lost my father recently due to COVID and I was old enough to have spent some quality time with both my parents together. Now your sister was without a proper father figure in her first 8 years and only had a quality bonding time with both your parents present for four years. It is also nice to hear that your father owns up to the fact that he was missing and accepts it. Also kudos to the fact that your sister has stayed in your life (especially with many posts found here on this forum).\n\nYour step mother knows how your sister feels. She could have dealt this situation as a mature adult by slowly breaking this situation down to your half siblings so that they don't misunderstand anything this situation. But what does she do? Simple - I won't tell anything about this to the kids because she clearly needs to come around and accept the fact that they are her siblings.... when your sister clearly said  that she doesn't want to do anything with them.\n\nAnd when you finally did reveal this to your half siblings, their reactions are understandable considering their ages. But instead of breaking this situation appropriately to her kids, what did your dad's wife do ? She yells at you because apparently you **spoke on something that I had no way of knowing.** I mean seriously?!?!\n\nSo while this entire situation sucks, especially so for your half siblings, you are definitely NTA..", "NTA\n\nYour dad needs to get his wife in check. Brynn has stated she wants nothing to do with any of the other kids, and that's her choice.

NTA.", "NTA. Your Stepmother should tell her children how it is if she doesn't want you to.", "YTA - OP, what if Brynn also wanted nothing to do with you? Would you still feel connected in some way to her since she is a blood sibling? Would you be fine with someone telling you as a child that you mean nothing to your sister? \n\nThey see you hanging out and getting to have a relationship with one of their blood relatives and understandably feel they are missing out. They are allowed to feel that way the same way your sister is allowed to not feel connected.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is advocating forcing a relationship with your siblings. The issue is despite your sisters lack of connection, your siblings DO feel connected and that needs to be acknowledged while explaining the truth of the situation.", "She is legally and biologically your half-siblings\u2019 sister, even if she wants nothing to do with them. So as to them, YTA for lying to them.\n\nAs to all the kids, if you were trying to be kind and explain gently so they could get over ongoing expectations and disappointment, that would have been sweet and kind. But it sounds like you did it because you were frustrated and were harsh or at the least overly and unnecessarily blunt with young children. YTA. \n\nBrynn can make her own choices, it is true. She should get some counseling though. It\u2019s a shame she is being as poor a sibling to her littlest siblings as her dad was as a parent to her. What an unfortunate way to carry on his shittiest legacy, especially since it sounds like your dad has worked hard to be a better person and parent.", "YTA. \n\nShe *is* their half sister, and it's not your place to deceive them. It wouldn't be an AH move to describe the relationship in an age-appropriate way, but you could keep it open because, while she very probably won't change her mind, it will always be her prerogative to, and you seem to have suggested that that *can't* happen.\n\nYou've told them not merely that it's your full sister's decision as to whether she has a relationship with her half-siblings (which would be true), but that there is *no* connection (which there is, at least with the half-siblings).\n\nUltimately, it is a fine line to walk, but you've made no attempt to do so: you owe it to both your older and younger siblings to let them reach their own decisions about what happened, and what will happen in the future.", "YTA.\n\nWhether or not Brynn likes it, those ARE her blood related siblings.  Her not choosing to have a relationship with them is a whole different matter.  She IS their sister though, which is why that was an AH thing to say since it's not even true. \n\nWhat you should have said is that their sister is estranged from all living family except for yourself and that it's her choice to make since she's an adult and nobody can force her to interact where she doesn't want to, and that you're not going to pester her about it because you value the relationship you two share and you respect her right to make that decision for herself.", "Yesssss. Step mother is the big AH here but OP needs to treat the Littles more gingerly. These aren't teenagers.", "I don\u2019t understand why you were downvoted. I completely agree with you. It really wasn\u2019t his place to tell his siblings the full truth at their age. Let the parents handle it. \n\nThe rest of the thread wants to say that the stepmom can\u2019t force the sister to feel a certain way (which is true), but the siblings also see her as their sister and OP has no right on telling them how they should feel. It\u2019s a mean thing to tell a child they are nothing to their sister, no matter how true it may be. Reddit likes to think honesty is always the best policy, but sometimes not telling the entire truth is the correct move.", "OP is NTA and neither is Brynn. She has every right to not only not be in her \"father's\" life but also to decide not to be in his other children's lives. The real AHs here are the parents for not shutting that down a long time ago and allowing the kids to keep harassing OP and hold onto hope that Brynn would eventually warm up to the other kids. She owes nothing to the other kids, and neither does OP.", "They already know she is biologically related to them. But blood does not equal family. Blood is all that ties her to them and it's meaningless to her because it is blood shared through my dad and she wants nothing to do with his family. It's different with me, I'm her brother, we share a mom and our grandparents and that love is still there.", ">YTA for lying to them.\n\nThe honest take is, she does not want to know you?

At some point, they need to understand that.  Anything more would be filling their head with false hope", "But they already know she is. But blood does not make you family or true siblings. They have never met, have no relationship and she doesn't ever want one. So while biologically they are related and they know (at least they know two are through dad).

It's nuanced.", "I am also adopted.
