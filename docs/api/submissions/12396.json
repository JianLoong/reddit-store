I asked him what if I was gay. He wouldn't have an issue accepting that.\n\nYou did judge him for his choice of significant other. You may have not said anything before, but if you hadn't judged him, you wouldn't have made this statement. This statement proves that you are unfit to be a mother more than you dating a man your son's age. What if he was gay? Would *you* accept *him? What if he's bisexual?!*\n\nAs a bisexual mother, I find you offensive and disgusting in every way imaginable, and I hope he never unblocks you and your other kids join him in separating from you.", "YTA since you seemed to expect calling him names was going to get him to change his mind. Look, he's not doing anything wrong. He seemed measured and mature in his response. He took a few weeks to think about it and he came to a decision \\*for himself\\*.

Seems like it's the right one \\*for him\\* and as an adult, that's his right. \n\nHopefully your blowup at him didn't just cause him to go from LC to NC (low contact to no contact, in case someone doesn't know the abbreviations.)", "YTA. \n\nImagine yourself in his shoes- wouldn\u2019t you feel the same if your dad that to you?\n\nYou also put your daughter in the middle and tried to have her mitigate you and your sons relationship.

That age gap isn't typically a healthy thing. Not that it couldn't be in some rare scenarios, but you sound a bit emotionally immature. \n\nThe way you talked to him wasn't constructive. It was reactive. You are the older adult in this scenario, but he seems to be handling this with more maturity than you. \n\nHe's obviously intensely uncomfortable with the situation and this is his way of not supporting it.

Your son is clearly appalled by the situation, and is doing his best to estrange himself from you, and maintain only minimal contact.  \n\nYou're getting married to someone pretty close to your son's age. An old school friend.  That is creepy as heck.  If the situation were reversed, and his father was dating a girl who was friends with your daughter in high school, you'd probably have a problem with that situation, as would your son and daughter.\n\nYour son doesn't owe you a relationship.  He certainly doesn't have to accept an old friend from high school as a new \"stepfather.\"  \n\nIf the bisexual woman your son dated was near his own age, and the relationship was freely chosen by both of them, what is there to judge?  \n\nThere is no law saying you can't stay in a relationship with his high school friend, if it makes you happy.  But there is also no rule saying that your son has to accept that relationship or be happy about it, or that he has to pretend that he's happy about it to make you happy.\n\nIf your happiness is contingent upon maintaining a romantic relationship with your son's high school friend, no matter how awkward and squicky it is for your son, then you have a choice to make.  You can stay in a relationship that makes your son uncomfortable, and accept that this means your son will not want to be around you because of the situation.  Or you can decide that your son's presence in your life is more important to you than your relationship, and end the relationship and work to repair things with your son.  \n\nAlthough, at this point, there is a significant chance that your son is not interested in resuming contact with you whether or not you stay in this relationship with his school friend.  And leaving the relationship would not create, for your son, any obligation to then repair his relationship with you. \n\nThat bridge may be burned.\n\nI'm glad that your son at least has his father as a parent who supports and prioritizes him. \n\nYou are entitled to happiness.  You are not entitled to have your son pretend to be happy about a situation that he finds uncomfortable just to make you happy.", "YTA. It has nothing to do with the age difference but the face it was one of his peers that he **SHARED A FRIEND GROUP WITH**. He is uncomfortable with that and has been honest with you about his feelings. I'm not saying you need to break up, but your lashing out at him over something very understandable was way off.", "Bisexual vs age difference is two different things.  YTA for comparing them to try to absolve yourself by throwing his choices as \"bad\".  Not even close.  He went to high school with your son and you can't understand his discomfort?\n\nYou bawled your eyes out and it didn't help.  Your words. guessing you're good at trying to manipulate.  Stop texting him daily.", "Your son has a right to his feelings and boundaries. You made your choice, now respect his. YTA.", "YTA- and actually creepy and predatory if you knew him when him and your son were in high school. He may technically be an adult now but if you knew him as a minor that is predatory. Everything about this is disgusting and you should be ashamed. I would have left for dads too. A general rude is if someone is young enough to be your child you stay away.\n\nEdit to say I re read and it\u2019s clear you DID know him as a child. Super YTA and beyond disgusting", "YTA \n\nYour son told you repeatedly that he wasn\u2019t comfortable. You can\u2019t force him to be comfortable with your relationship. \n\nIt also doesn\u2019t even sound like he cut you off, he just kept his distance because, as he said multiple times, he isn\u2019t comfortable with your relationship. \n\n*You* pushed the subject. *You* caused an argument. \n\nAlso please understand that *most* people would be uncomfortable with their parent dating their peer. I actually think your son treated the situation much better than most people would.", "YTA. Your son made a very fair boundary. He is not comfortable watching you date/marry someone he grew up with. \n\nYou being upset with that is completely valid, the way you\u2019re handling it is not. It\u2019s not up to your son to mitigate or consider your feelings first and foremost. That responsibility lies with you and you alone, especially in a situation like this where it doesnt seem like you\u2019ve considered *his* feelings for even a second. Why you seem to think he should spend any energy on your feelings, i\u2019ll never know.", "YTA. Ultimately, your son gets to decide what degree of relationship he wants with you. Hurling insults isn\u2019t going to make him accept your decisions.", "YTA. I was going to say NAH until your last paragraph. Actions have consequences; sometimes good and sometimes bad. You chose and continue to choose to have the relationship with your boyfriend. The consequence of that action is your son distancing himself. That\u2019s his right, because he\u2019s not comfortable with your relationship. He set a boundary, made it known to you, and still called you for Mother\u2019s Day, etc. You cannot change his boundary simply because you want to, and blowing up at him was an AH move.", "Yta.  You are about to marry someone who could easily be your child, and you are pissed that your actual child isn't happy about it?", "YTA, you can't help who you love but he can't help his feelings about it and is being the bigger person by stepping back and letting you do what you want. You can't force him to accept your decisions and he finds this one too creepy to overcome. You seem hell-bent on antagonizing him and so he wants nothing to do with you.", "What does him being in a bisexual relationship have to do with anything? How is that remotely relevant? \n\nYou have some choices to make. Your boyfriend is a peer of your son. Your son is not comfortable with that. I think he has good reason and I'm curious if you take his concerns seriously. Do you have any concerns at all? Are you willing to explore any concerns? Your relationship with your boyfriend may work out. Or not. You've been divorced before. Your son is forever. You don't have to cater to him, but you have to respect his feelings and his views. \n\nDo you have the capacity to see your relationship outside your own lens? As an older woman, are there any power dynamics involved (you have age, wisdom, experience, earning power, etc). Does your bf want children? Are you going to be a parent again? \n\nI'm pretty sure that if I started dating someone of my son's age, there would be a rift in our relationship. So I would be making choices in the face of that. \n\nSo YTA - partly for the bf sitch but mainlyfor not seeing how difficult this is for your son. \n\nAlso, do you have to get married now? If this is a forever relationship, marriage can happen at any time.", "YTA  - You created this odd dynamic with you son. The world is full of people to date and you chose his peer. Most people would struggle with your decision; it goes against a cultural norm. You have the right to marry but you cannot dictate, bully and demean him to accept your life decision. When you blame his behavior look in the mirror.", "YTA. Until the last part, I was feeling that, yes, its a tough situation but no one was really being an AH. But then you had to call him names and act like dating a bi woman is equivalent to dating someone who was born when you were already an adult. He was civil to you and your boyfriend, and when you got tired of guilting him directly and through your daughter (which is a bad thing to do to your kids anyway) you snapped on him because he won't accept a relationship which prob feels a bit pedophilic from his point of view.", "Yep, YTA.\n\nSometimes, I wonder if people hear themselves when they speak. Of course he doesn't want anything to do with this situation... I wouldn't either. You're literally living a joke in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure... I'm sorry if that hurts you, but the age difference and his relationship to your son.... eeeeewwwww, lady. EW.", "Jesus christ huge YTA. Your son is allowed to feel grossed out by his mom dating one of his former peers. He told you how he felt upfront, and you chose your boyfriend knowing that it could drive your son away.\n\nAlso that comment about being ok with your son dating a bisexual woman is fucking disgusting. It is not strange AT ALL to date a bisexual person, and the fact that you threw that in shows you clearly think it is. On the other hand, your situation is pretty fuckin weird to most people.", "YTA and this is gross", "yes definitely YTA. you and your boyfriend are both consenting adults who are making the decision to be together, that\u2019s up to you. your son is making the decision to not support your relationship with someone who could be his elder brother, age-wise, and who literally went to college at the same time as him, that\u2019s up to him, it\u2019s an entirely understandable and valid way to feel, and you calling him names only proves that his decision to stay away, and now finally block you was correct. \nalso, there\u2019s nothing to judge when it comes to him getting involved with a bisexual woman. what\u2019s wrong with that? absolutely nothing. the fact that you even mentioned it as something you could\u2019ve judged says a lot about you", "Wow. I think your son is fantastic. Wonderful boundaries there. You violated his boundaries butt good by dating his school-mate. And I agree with your son - you have the right to keep your own relationship, as a grown adult.   \n\n\nBut your son also has rights. And it is totally normal to be completely icked out that mom is marrying a boy who used to do highschool with him. Reading between the lines, I can see that this youngling you are marrying is younger than your eldest daughter.   \n\n\nThis whole thing has abuse written all over it. The only good thing I can say is that you raised a son who is able to name it and deal with his emotions about it in a mature way.   \n\n\nIf you want a relationship with your son, you will stop trying to manipulate him into being comfortable with a relationship that is inherently yucky for him. You'll accept where he is standing and work on having a relationship in a way that is good for both of you, and that's not going to involve your fiance for the time being. And it certainly isn't going to be a wedding celebration any time soon.   \n\n\nAnd stop calling names like \"spoiled close minded brat.\" Adults don't call names like that. Perhaps some counseling is in order if you feel entitled to say that to another human being and THEN expect them to show up at your wedding. That doesn't even make sense. Who would do that?   \n\n\nYTA.", "Yta. How is being gay anything like a nearly 20 year age difference? Hint: it's not. You're disrespecting your son's boundaries coz you're not getting what you want. Dick move.", "Yikes\u2026. YTA big time\u2026 not only is it disgusting to date someone your son went to high school with for OBVIOUS reasons but the fact that YOU KNEW and still perused him\u2026. Just gross.", "YTA for not ending the relationship. The age difference is creepy and now you lost your son and future son\u2019s family.", "YTA. \n\nYour son is allowed to have boundaries and not support all your decisions in life. He is uncomfortable with your relationship. Your son appears to have handled this in a very mature manner. He accepted you are able to make your own choices, but told you he would need to step back for his own comfort. He didn\u2019t impede on your autonomy or ask you to chose, but he clearly stated what the outcome would be of your decision. \n\nThe ball was in your court and you made your choice. Now, you have to deal with the effects of that choice. \n\nYou have ZERO right to call your son names because he clearly outlined his boundaries of comfort. I don\u2019t blame him for blocking you. You behaved in a very toxic manner and he is well within his rights to cut toxicity out of his life.", "YTA.\n\nDate who you want, but no son or anyone with their own morals intact would feel comfortable with their friend (classmate/peer in this case) would find this acceptable. He has every right to feel the way he does and no matter the circumstances you need to accept that he will not be comfortable with you in that relationship. \n\nIt seems you need to re-evaluate your position as a mother seeking a relationship with someone close in age to your own son as well as someone your son actively grew up with. \n\n*opinion* I think it\u2019s a little gross that you would expect your son to feel comfortable with you being in an active relationship with someone that he went to school with.", "YTA not surprised you had to find a kid to marry.", "YTA , I agree with him this is a very uncomfortable dynamic. Not sure it\u2019s at all appropriate. I mean Macron did it but even his step children whom he actually went to school with took a LONG time to come around and that\u2019s France", "YTA, you\u2019re choosing a boyfriend over your son. Clearly your son doesn\u2019t mean as much to you as you\u2019d like to present he does. He\u2019s got every right to not be comfortable with your relationship, which is realistically not going to last anyway. He isn\u2019t being unreasonable, he isn\u2019t making demands and he isn\u2019t expecting you to discontinue the relationship, he just doesn\u2019t want to be a part of it. Your homophobia doesn\u2019t help you look any better, and has nothing to do with him accepting your relationship.

I asked him what if I was gay.\"\n\nTranslation: You're a raging bigot. And you're now comparing being gay to being a predator (which is precisely what you are. I don't care if it's legal or not. Hell, you even knew this guy when he was a literal child!)\n\nYou're son was still maintaining a relationship with you, but keeping his distance for OBVIOUS reasons.

This can't be real. You really pulled the homophobe cliche at the end? Being gay isn't a choice. Dating someone who can be your child is.", "YTA\n\nAnd playing the \"I'm allowed to be happy\" line is bullshit. You could have found that happiness with a million other dudes than your son's classmate.\n\nAre you 15? You couldn't look elsewhere when you found out who the guy was?? Or were you just so enamored with yourself pulling a man half your age that you couldn't step back and put yourself in your own son's shoes for one second?\n\nHave fun trying to mend that one. Even if you ditch the fiance(lol), he's never going to forget how callous you are in regards to his feelings. Hope it was worth it!", "YTA.\n\nMy ex's dad did this, started dating a girl around our age, and it was beyond uncomfortable. You're entitled to date whoever you want, but your son made his feelings clear from the beginning. You made the choice to continue pursuing the relationship KNOWING how he felt, with him repeatedly making it clear, and now suddenly you expect an engagement ring to make everything better? That's honestly kind of delusional. Marrying this man doesn't change the date on his diploma and magically erase the past. And throwing that weird remark about his bi ex is absolutely disgusting. You're implying that because you \"tolerated\" his partner's sexuality (which, by the way, has NOTHING to do with you and your approval is neither necessary nor wanted) he now has to accept your partner without question, which is a completely ridiculous expectation.", "YTA\n\nlike also predator vibes can't shake those.", "YTA, you chose your boyfriend over your son.

After meeting for several weeks I decided to tell my son when he came back for winter break of his junior year in college.\n\nHe thought I was joking. Then he was in shock. He packed up all of his stayed at his dad's place. I tried to talk to my ex who I have an amicable relationship. He told me I should give him time but I am also being unrealistic if I thought any guy would be comfortable in that situation.\n\nHe approached me after several weeks to talk. He told me while he understands I need companionship, he still isn't comfortable with me being involved with one of his peers. He isn't going to try to stop me or confront my boyfriend. However, he doesn't accept my relationship and plans to keep his distance. He apologized if this made him a bad son. I bawled my eyes out and told him I still need him in my life. That didn't help.\n\nMy boyfriend was luckily there to comfort me. My daughter also visited me from time to time (she's my eldest). These two years haven't been that good. For his last year in college, he only dropped by twice for summer and winter break. He only bought one ticket for me while he bought two for dad and stepmom. I completely understood. I've asked my daughter to talk to him. However, she said she's not going to get involved anymore. She initially asked him, \"Doesn't mom deserve to be happy?\" He always responded, \"She deserves to be happy, and if it means she sees me less so be it. I'm not stopping from seeing her boyfriend.\"\n\nDespite him living an hour away, I barely saw his face for a year. I've always initiated calls. He's only called me for Mother's day and on my birthday. My daughter told me he was moving west coast to pursue grad studies and be closer to my ex who also moved a year ago\n\nIt's been a yea since he has moved and it feels like he is an estranged relative. I only got a call on my birthday. I text him every day but he only responds with one to two words. I've asked several times if I can visit him but he says he is too busy. \n\nMy boyfriend proposed to me and I said yes. I wanted to share it with everyone. I shared it with everyone. My son said congrats. I asked him if he would be at my wedding. He said that he still doesn't feel comfortable.\n\nI got angry and I called him a spoiled, close-minded brat. I told him I never judged him for getting into involved with a bisexual woman. I asked him what if I was gay. He wouldn't have an issue accepting that. I ask him \"Why can't he accept my relationship then?\".\n\nHe told me to go to hell and blocked me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Second of all why are you dating someone LITERALLY young enough to be your child? Why doesn't that make you uncomfortable?", "YTA - Did you really compare being gay to having a relationship with someone young enough to be your kid? You can\u2019t be that clueless to not know why they are DRASTICALLY different. \n\nHopefully he does go no contact with you.

Your son went to high school with this boy. How can you expect him to respect your choice when your choice reeks of trying to be a teenager again?", "YTA. Age gap aside, he tells you he's going to keep his distance and you respond by constantly messaging him on a daily basis? You're aware he's his own person, right? An adult with his own life and thoughts and opinions etcetera? It doesn't seem like that's sunk in.", "Predatory AND homofobic, damn, you for sure are a piece", "Coming to Reddit for relationship advice when there is a large age gap is a BAD idea. That being said, life is all about choices we make. Your son chose to distance himself from your relationship. You chose your new partner over your son. That is an indisputable fact. He couldn\u2019t process your new  love life in a healthy way so he got out of the way. You chose to continue it. I don\u2019t know if that makes YTA. \n\nI will say that pressuring your son to get over it is an asshole move. You have no idea what his relationship with your boyfriend was like away from adults. Have you ever asked your son if there was a problem you don\u2019t know about???", "You can't force your son to accept your relationship.

You getting with one of his high school peers is not the same as him dating a bisexual woman or you being gay. To even mention it tells me you did judge the situation which the average normal person would not bat an eye over.

Be realistic regardless if you have a decent relationship with your ex or not if he was dating a girl the same age as either your son or daughter you\u2019d probably be disgusted yourself. It\u2019s one thing to have random hookups amongst consenting adults where there are large age gaps. It\u2019s another thing where you are trying to act like you have legitimate things in common from a life experience situation. 7-10 years is one thing. Does this kid even have a job? It\u2019s creepy. I don\u2019t believe you met in a bar and if you did it was because you recognized him or he recognized you and he wanted to score with someone\u2019s mom.

Because she's selfish.", "Well I never said he's a bad person. He is not obligated to accept it. I just said that in an ideal situation family is unconditional but more often then not that's not really the case unfortunately. The only thing the mother can do is tell her son that he will always be welcome and leave it there to decide for him.", "You called the son an asshole though, since you said nta instead of nah. And that also means you think it's okay to defend an age gap relation by comparing it to someone being bisexual."]}
