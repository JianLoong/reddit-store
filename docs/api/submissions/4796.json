It could be anywhere from you going 20 over the speed limit and ignoring children clearly playing near the street, to you driving under limit and a child jumping out from behind bushes. Given a kid's life was at risk, it isn't unreasonable for the mom to be angry about it, and given the (potentially justified) road rage on your part and people generally being awful at self-assessing driving, I don't think we can actually know how well you were driving in the moment.", "NTA you simply responded in the same fashion she did to you.  You weren't the one who let a small child out of their sight.  There is a reason they call something like this a mishap or in a worse case, an accident.", "NTA.

Your partner needs to settle down. Being a 20 yr old is not an excuse for not watching your child.  Being stressed is not a reason for not watching your child either.

She blamed you for driving on the street. She started it.", "I\u2019ll go with NTA. As a mom of an 18 month old that loves to run, my husband and I have to keep an eye on him constantly whenever we take him outside. Kids channel their inner Houdini all the time, and no, parents don\u2019t have eyes in the backs of their heads, so we don\u2019t always catch their mischief right away. Which is why we go through such extreme efforts to set up safe spaces for them to play in. \n\nThis mom should know how to set up a safe space the child can\u2019t escape from. This was her fault, not yours. Her initial anger at you will wear down to self guilt eventually, and hopefully those around her will encourage her to take better precautions moving forward. Either way, she was probably spooked out of her mind, so I get where your gf was coming from, since you could have used less colorful language, but if this doesn\u2019t teach her something about taking better precautions, then frankly, I fear for the child\u2019s life.", "NTA to be honest you went through a horrible near miss.

If you\u2019d call her a stupid bitch you\u2019d call your gf one too. It would make me think twice about you that\u2019s for sure. Also you were driving down a village lane at what speed that you breaking squealed to a stop? YTA and sadly I\u2019m not even slightly surprised at all the people thinking you were in the right, this thread is full of casual sexists. Dumbass is not equal to stupid bitch for future reference.

But look you were startled, probably a little scared and spoke without thinking. It happens.", "I'm going with an ESH to a light NTA. You really shouldn't have used such strong language in front of a child, like that, but the mother absolutely should have kept a better eye on her child. But I get it, kids can run away from their parents in a flash. This is just a bad situation that neither of you handled great.", "Horn would have been enough if the woman didn't lay the blame at your feet.\n\nThe words out of her mouth should have been \"OMG I'm so sorry, are you guys ok?\"  \nNTA", "NTA for asking the woman take better care with her child.\n\nNext time just say \"what a lovely example you are setting to your child.\"", "It wasn't useful at all, YTA for that deluded statement alone, but I wouldn't have gone with that judgement otherwise. You were stressed and responding directly to someone yelling at you for an accident that was their fault, that you managed to avoid.", "YTA, your partner is right and your road rage helps nothing and nobody.", "NAH. You all reacted in a pretty standard way to a stressful situation. Your GF probably shouted at you because she was scared as well.", "I\u2019m going gentle ESH. \n\nYes, she should be watching her child. But unless you have a kid that age, you wouldn\u2019t understand how fast they can decide to bolt away from you no matter how closely you watch them. She yelled at you more than likely out of fear for her kid. I don\u2019t condone that, but it\u2019s understandable.\n\nYou were also scared and upset, which is why you yelled back. But you can\u2019t just assume she wasn\u2019t watching her kid, because they will just turn and run in a split second without a thought. I get why you were upset, but how does calling someone a stupid bitch in front of their kid help anything?", "Eh I don't think either of you really handled this well. Probably because both of you were talking out of fear of almost hitting the child.\n\nYour language was stronger tbh. And yeah she should have been watching her kid, but we all know, kids can get away so quickly. also kind of shitty for you to have seen your yelling as useful. \n\nESH", "ESH - You're definitely an asshole for calling a woman with a small child a  \"bitch.\" She's an asshole for calling you a \"dumbass.\"\n\nWe're all capable of being assholes, particularly under duress. Everyone needs to cut each other some slack, and try better next time. Dumbass.", "ESH for the gendered language, especially on a complete stranger. But I don't think yelling in and of itself makes you TA in this scenario. You had just as much of a justification for being stressed and overanxious as she did; you almost killed someone!", "NTA - a little for the sexist slur though", "Yeah NTA. But bear in mind that gf's reaction is down to how unattractive it is so see a man screaming with rage at a woman/child in the street.", "ESH. Mother shouldn\u2019t have been yelling at someone for driving blind when her child ran out into the road. But if your gut reaction is to call someone that name, yikes. \n\nSeems like it was a high tension situation so I don\u2019t really want to call either of you ah\u2019s because of that, but then the name calling had to happen. Just want to point out, she was probably watching her child and couldn\u2019t catch up, these situations happen very easily and it\u2019s scary.", "ESH\nShe insulted you first, so I get why you said what you did, but that doesn't make it okay.

As I was driving down the main road of the village we live in, a little girl (maybe 4ish?) suddenly shot off across the road in front of the car.\n\nI absolutely slammed down on the brakes, the car lurched and squealed, my partner who was speaking choked as the seatbelt tightened around her and it was all very sudden and frightening.\n\nI pounded my fist on the horn at the girl and rolled down the window at the mother who ran out to pull her back, then she yelled at me, saying to \"Watch where you're driving you blind dumbass!\" I was really furious and shouted back at her, don\u2019t remember exactly what was said but something like \u201cWatch your child you fucking stupid bitch!\u201d\n\nWe rolled the window back up and carried on, but my partner was annoyed at me. She said I really shouldn\u2019t have shouted and sworn at the mother and that she was very young (she looked like very early 20s) and must be really stressed rn. I said that she would have been a hell of a lot more stressed if her daughter had been killed because she couldn\u2019t look after her properly.\n\nIt blew up into quite an argument with her defending the mum, saying that the horn would have scared her enough and that it was really unnecessary for me to scream at her like that.\n\nI admit that I was slightly out of control with anger, but considering I very nearly killed a child because of her mother\u2019s negligence and that shouting at her was not only justified because of the situation, but useful to startle her into keeping better hold of her daughter in future.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Did you help the situation? Is it EVER okay to yell and call anyone a stupid fucking bitch? Better to yell thank God she wasn\u2019t injured. You were driving through a village. Were you going too fast? Your partner is right. Yelling at terrified people is never ok. Yelling obscenities is never helpful. Grow up.", "NTA between your car and the four year old only one of you was supposed to be in the road.

I think there was a near miss for various reasons and it scared the crap out of both of you. And while screaming profanities at each other isn\u2019t productive, it\u2019s very understandable in the circumstances.

If your car squealed, then you were driving fast. 2. Mother didn't supervise her child properly. 3. If she is an AH for yelling at you because of frustration, then you are AH too for yelling because of frustration. 4. I like your girlfriend defending other woman because it is the only way to teach men to respect women. 5. After the initial argument, you must calm down. Because you were still driving. 6.
