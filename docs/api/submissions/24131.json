If we're not working on that day, we mostly get takeout or go out to eat out.\n\nOn the rare occasions we want homemade dinner, I'm the one who cooks because frankly, my husband is a horrible cook. Always has been.\n\nSo my 31st birthday fell on a workday this year and I wasn't planning on celebrating anything. Just wanted to get some nice dinner with my husband and watch a movie afterwards or something. I asked him if he wanted to go to one of our favourite restaurants that day and he said no, he would take care of dinner. I thought cool, thinking he'd get takeout or order in.\n\nWell, that day when I came from work, I go into the living room and I see husband setting up the table. He says he made me dinner and that surprised me because again, he is not a good cook. But I sit down and wait for him to finish setting up the table. \n\nAnd well, it was bad. Very bad. \n\nThe pasta dish he made, the sauce was weirdly grainy and oily. Smelled off too. He tried to make little pies stuffed with cheese, but all the pies were half burned and most of the cheese had oozed out from them already. The chocolate pudding he made for dessert was still extremely liquidy. \n\nIt was very clear that nothing turned out the way it should have, but I thanked him and told him I appreciated the effort. But that we both knew that his cooking skills are bad, so he should have just gotten takeout or order in. He got upset but honestly, he knew the food was messed up. \n\nAnd I still wanted a nice dinner so I asked if he wanted to order in but he refused. So, I still ordered food for him too in case he wanted it later but he only ate his portion of the dinner.

When I first met my bf we were both 24 and he had never cooked a meal in his life. His mum always babied him and his siblings and would never let him do anything even if he wanted to do it. We had the house to ourselves for a week and he offered to cook me food as usually I was the cook. I was delighted and said yes. He made me chilli con Carne. The chilli was out of a can which I wouldn\u2019t have had a problem with if he hadn\u2019t of burnt it to the saucepan so there was burnt bits in it.

In the end I ended up teaching him how to cook and now 5 years later he\u2019s actually a really good natural cook. He just needed a little help \ud83d\ude42 \n\nI would apologise for hurting his feelings.

At the time I was just a girlfriend to his grandson. He could have thrown the apple dumpling away and told me it wasn't safe to eat. But he didn't. He ate it with a straight face and complimented me on it. It might sound silly but I felt accepted by him in that moment. Maybe he did it for the sake of his grandson.

I also think someone deserves to eat what they want on their birthday. OP mentioned wanting to go to her favorite restaurant and he said no.

Like really?\n\nWas it just not up your standards or actually objectively terrible?\n\nI ask cause I used to suck at cooking, I've gotten better but if  I tried and objectively failed I would own that failure and be like:  \n\n\"Look I tried to make this nice meal, but I fucked up, I'm sorry\".\n\nAnd to that my partner would be like:\n\n\"Come here\" and give me a big hug and a kiss and thank me anyway and it would all be ok lol.", "I think it\u2019s the thought that counts.

I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole but it was hurtful.", "NTA. No way would I risk food poisoning to spare his feelings. You told him what you wanted and he didn't listen. It was your birthday why did he honestly think this was a good idea?", "To me this is still an ESE\n\n\nIf it is the thought that counts- he didn't put much into it.

That's when you take her out for a nice birthday dinner that she can actually enjoy instead, but... he still wanted her to eat it even though OP says he knew it was bad :/ That's when it stops being a thoughtful gift and starts being an imposition. If you know the food you made is gross, you don't guilt people into eating it anyway, no matter how frustrating it is that it didn't turn out well. OP says it looked unappetizing and smelled off, and I don't think she should have had to choke down gross food on her birthday (though if it was me, I'd have probably at least taken a token bite. Seems more gracious that way.)", "Husband, yes, but your father-in-law is amazing! :)", "I got mixed up and used baking powder instead of cornflour to coat chicken in a stir fry.

There\u2019s so many ways in which he could give her food poisoning it not even funny. If there\u2019s egg in the liquid pudding that\u2019s a problem. Did he wash his hands beforehand? How long did the sauce sit out before service? Serving his wife burnt cheeseless dough doesn\u2019t say nice birthday dinner. What part of liquid pudding, box pasta with a crappy gritty sauce says I tried? If he can\u2019t cook you really think any part of that meal was truly tolerable or something somebody would want for their birthday?
