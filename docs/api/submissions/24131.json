If we're not working on that day, we mostly get takeout or go out to eat out.\n\nOn the rare occasions we want homemade dinner, I'm the one who cooks because frankly, my husband is a horrible cook. Always has been.\n\nSo my 31st birthday fell on a workday this year and I wasn't planning on celebrating anything. Just wanted to get some nice dinner with my husband and watch a movie afterwards or something. I asked him if he wanted to go to one of our favourite restaurants that day and he said no, he would take care of dinner. I thought cool, thinking he'd get takeout or order in.\n\nWell, that day when I came from work, I go into the living room and I see husband setting up the table. He says he made me dinner and that surprised me because again, he is not a good cook. But I sit down and wait for him to finish setting up the table. \n\nAnd well, it was bad. Very bad. \n\nThe pasta dish he made, the sauce was weirdly grainy and oily. Smelled off too. He tried to make little pies stuffed with cheese, but all the pies were half burned and most of the cheese had oozed out from them already. The chocolate pudding he made for dessert was still extremely liquidy. \n\nIt was very clear that nothing turned out the way it should have, but I thanked him and told him I appreciated the effort. But that we both knew that his cooking skills are bad, so he should have just gotten takeout or order in. He got upset but honestly, he knew the food was messed up. \n\nAnd I still wanted a nice dinner so I asked if he wanted to order in but he refused. So, I still ordered food for him too in case he wanted it later but he only ate his portion of the dinner. Afterwards, he called me a jerk and said at the very least, I should have had tried the food. \n\nIt's been a few weeks since, and sometimes I think that I was too harsh and maybe I should have just tried the food even if I knew it would be bad.

When I first met my bf we were both 24 and he had never cooked a meal in his life. His mum always babied him and his siblings and would never let him do anything even if he wanted to do it. We had the house to ourselves for a week and he offered to cook me food as usually I was the cook. I was delighted and said yes. He made me chilli con Carne. The chilli was out of a can which I wouldn\u2019t have had a problem with if he hadn\u2019t of burnt it to the saucepan so there was burnt bits in it.

In the end I ended up teaching him how to cook and now 5 years later he\u2019s actually a really good natural cook. He just needed a little help \ud83d\ude42 \n\nI would apologise for hurting his feelings.

At the time I was just a girlfriend to his grandson. He could have thrown the apple dumpling away and told me it wasn't safe to eat. But he didn't. He ate it with a straight face and complimented me on it. It might sound silly but I felt accepted by him in that moment. Maybe he did it for the sake of his grandson.

I also think someone deserves to eat what they want on their birthday. OP mentioned wanting to go to her favorite restaurant and he said no.
