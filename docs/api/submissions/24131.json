So on weekdays, we tend to have very light dinners (think just some simple sandwiches) or sometimes even nothing if we're still full from lunch. If we're not working on that day, we mostly get takeout or go out to eat out.\n\nOn the rare occasions we want homemade dinner, I'm the one who cooks because frankly, my husband is a horrible cook. Always has been.\n\nSo my 31st birthday fell on a workday this year and I wasn't planning on celebrating anything. Just wanted to get some nice dinner with my husband and watch a movie afterwards or something. I asked him if he wanted to go to one of our favourite restaurants that day and he said no, he would take care of dinner. I thought cool, thinking he'd get takeout or order in.\n\nWell, that day when I came from work, I go into the living room and I see husband setting up the table. He says he made me dinner and that surprised me because again, he is not a good cook. But I sit down and wait for him to finish setting up the table. \n\nAnd well, it was bad. Very bad. \n\nThe pasta dish he made, the sauce was weirdly grainy and oily. Smelled off too. He tried to make little pies stuffed with cheese, but all the pies were half burned and most of the cheese had oozed out from them already. The chocolate pudding he made for dessert was still extremely liquidy. \n\nIt was very clear that nothing turned out the way it should have, but I thanked him and told him I appreciated the effort. But that we both knew that his cooking skills are bad, so he should have just gotten takeout or order in. He got upset but honestly, he knew the food was messed up. \n\nAnd I still wanted a nice dinner so I asked if he wanted to order in but he refused. So, I still ordered food for him too in case he wanted it later but he only ate his portion of the dinner. Afterwards, he called me a jerk and said at the very least, I should have had tried the food. \n\nIt's been a few weeks since, and sometimes I think that I was too harsh and maybe I should have just tried the food even if I knew it would be bad.

When I first met my bf we were both 24 and he had never cooked a meal in his life. His mum always babied him and his siblings and would never let him do anything even if he wanted to do it. We had the house to ourselves for a week and he offered to cook me food as usually I was the cook. I was delighted and said yes. He made me chilli con Carne. The chilli was out of a can which I wouldn\u2019t have had a problem with if he hadn\u2019t of burnt it to the saucepan so there was burnt bits in it.

In the end I ended up teaching him how to cook and now 5 years later he\u2019s actually a really good natural cook. He just needed a little help \ud83d\ude42 \n\nI would apologise for hurting his feelings.

OP could have been nicer about the whole thing, but I\u2019m just gonna say NTA because it\u2019s just not fair to be put in this situation on her birthday. \n\nAlso, I reiterate, forcing emotional labor on somebody isn\u2019t a loving and romantic gesture\u2026it\u2019s selfish. I love my wife with all of my heart, but if she served me something that I could literally tell by sight was inedible, I wouldn\u2019t eat it, and it wouldn\u2019t mean I love her any less (she would do the same if I did this and I wouldn\u2019t think she loved me any less either).", "NTA. Any other day than your birthday, my opinion would be different. But I have been in your shoes. It feels really bad to only want a nice dinner for your birthday, clearly ask for it, and be ignored.\n\nAsk your husband to try cooking a small dish on other days. You can try his attempts at cooking another time. Good luck!", "ESH. Can you totally put you on the spot on your birthday and that\u2019s not cool. And you should have at least tried the food.", "YTA. \n\nI would\u2019ve been on board with you asking to order out or have a nice dinner somewhere else, until I read that you hadn\u2019t even tried the food. Your partner TRIED to make a birthday dinner, and what did you do? Refuse to even try it, and then tell him that \u201cbut we both knew his cooking skills were bad, so he should\u2019ve just gotten takeout or order in.\u201d\n\n\nYeesh. Even if it looked disgusting you could\u2019ve at least given it a shot to be polite.", "YTA", "YTA trying the food would\u2019ve at least been the minimum. Even when someone cooks something I know is bad I\u2019ll still push myself to try it to give constructive criticism.", "You didnt even try the food, yeah thats mean.", "I'm glad everyone here is saying YTA because you are. If he was able to eat his portion of the meal and not get sick or gag when eating, the very least you could have done is tried it.\n\nI understand the presentation of the meal may have been offputting but that is no excuse for you completely turning your nose up at it and refusing to even take a bite", "YTA but what the heck? Cheese pies, pasta sauce, and pudding?", "YTA. A gift is a gift.", "YTA. Him cooking for you when it's so hard for him was an attempt to do something special for you. You didn't even try it? That seems... mean, to me.", "YTA.\nHe tried to do something romantic and you didn\u2019t even give it a shot. Yes, he should have planned better, but come on dude", "YTA.\n\nYou didn't even *try* the food? Not one bite? Preschool children are often held to a higher standard of behavior. You should feel embarrassed.", "My husband's chicken is sawdust coated in blackened seasoning. I've choked it down for 6 years. Just grab ketchup or bbq sauce.", "ESH\n\nYou could have at least tried the food, and while I get you were upset you didn\u2019t have to be mean. \n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have decided that your birthday diner is the time to start learning to cook.", "YTA. \n\nHindsight is 20/20 but your knee jerk reaction.. needs to be more loving lol", "ESH. He knows he can\u2019t cook. His attempts at cooking shouldn\u2019t be on holidays, birthdays or special occasions where ruining a meal or it being inedible isn\u2019t a big deal. I feel like he threw that together as a sloppy attempt without any thought. You should have been more gentle in your response to his poor attempt. Maybe have tried a bite of something or everything if possible.", "To be fair, homie didn\u2019t need to decide to start teaching himself to cook starting with OP\u2019s **birthday meal**\u2026", "Too much like common sense.", "Omg seriously!", "The first time my BF tried to cook me dinner it was inedible. I still tried to cut into the \u201cBBQ chicken\u201d and took a bite. He took a bite. We looked at each other and started snickering as he got up to bring me the pizza menus nearby. \n\nI knew it would be inedible when I peeked in the oven and asked how he had prepared and was cooking the chicken. But he wanted to cook for me so I played along. \n\nBreakfast was and still is his stronger meal, but he can cook dinner now as well.", "Or do that BUT invite your friend or family member that knows how to cook well and have them help you lol. Op still would have been impressed/ feeling good even if he had help!", "You'd be thrilled with inedible food?", "Wonder no further you AH", "What the fuck lol. \n\nHow were you so sure it was bad then?", "YTA, you couldve at least tried it.", "But if you don't know how to cook, you don't realize how hard it can be. I'm betting he watched some youtube videos with people saying, \"It's so easy your kid could do it\". Sounds like the sauce broke and he doesn't know ovens can have hot spots. Did he go a little too hard? Yes. Could OP have handled it more graciously? Also yes.", "On her b day no less. That's not the day to take a risk. Try a practice meal on an ordinary day. You should never attempt a birthday meal if you're not certain you can cook something delicious.", "This is why I don't understand Y T A . Out of all the days he could of cooked for OP he picked her birthday?! When he knows he's not a good cook! I'm sorry but the one day you get to say no and refuse something is on your birthday. She wanted to have a nice dinner on her bday and instead got burnt pies with no filling. It's not romantic when you don't listen to what your SO tells you what they want and then complain about how they didn't like the thing they said they didn't want.", "THIS EXACTLY. Why is he not held accountable for putting her in a shitty position ON HER BIRTHDAY?", "Not to mention food poisoning. Liquid pudding \ud83e\udd22. There is no way in hell I'm giving myself food poisoning to appease my SOs ego.", "To me what was behind it was selfishness! He KNOWS HE'S A BAD COOK and he could have chosen any other day to start cooking. In that case I would have said yes, try it and offer constructive feedback if he's genuinely trying to learn to cook.", "Maybe\u2026but it\u2019s also written to put OP in the best light. I\u2019m factoring that in too. Does he know, or does OP think he knows?\n\nEither way, it\u2019s a dick move, and I won\u2019t be persuaded otherwise.", "Its a dick move to do something like this on someone's bday. Op told their boyfriend they wanted to go out. Bf instead said let's order out and stay in. But then completely changes the plans OP okd. Bf is a asshole for not listening to what their SO wanted on their BIRTHDAY."]}
