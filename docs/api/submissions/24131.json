So on weekdays, we tend to have very light dinners (think just some simple sandwiches) or sometimes even nothing if we're still full from lunch. If we're not working on that day, we mostly get takeout or go out to eat out.\n\nOn the rare occasions we want homemade dinner, I'm the one who cooks because frankly, my husband is a horrible cook. Always has been.\n\nSo my 31st birthday fell on a workday this year and I wasn't planning on celebrating anything. Just wanted to get some nice dinner with my husband and watch a movie afterwards or something. I asked him if he wanted to go to one of our favourite restaurants that day and he said no, he would take care of dinner. I thought cool, thinking he'd get takeout or order in.\n\nWell, that day when I came from work, I go into the living room and I see husband setting up the table. He says he made me dinner and that surprised me because again, he is not a good cook. But I sit down and wait for him to finish setting up the table. \n\nAnd well, it was bad. Very bad. \n\nThe pasta dish he made, the sauce was weirdly grainy and oily. Smelled off too. He tried to make little pies stuffed with cheese, but all the pies were half burned and most of the cheese had oozed out from them already. The chocolate pudding he made for dessert was still extremely liquidy. \n\nIt was very clear that nothing turned out the way it should have, but I thanked him and told him I appreciated the effort. But that we both knew that his cooking skills are bad, so he should have just gotten takeout or order in. He got upset but honestly, he knew the food was messed up. \n\nAnd I still wanted a nice dinner so I asked if he wanted to order in but he refused. So, I still ordered food for him too in case he wanted it later but he only ate his portion of the dinner. Afterwards, he called me a jerk and said at the very least, I should have had tried the food. \n\nIt's been a few weeks since, and sometimes I think that I was too harsh and maybe I should have just tried the food even if I knew it would be bad.

Yeah you ought to have tried the food first at least. I know it seems like a minor thing but it's still would have helped your case. \n\nWhy not try cooking together or taking a class together... it seems like something he genuinely wants to do.", "ESH, a birthday is not the time to practice cooking.

Appreciate the man\u2019s effort; while he may be aware of the fact that he isn\u2019t a Jamie Oliver of Gordon Ramsey, the fact that he _tried_ for you should have been enough reason for you to at least try it.\n\nReacting this way won\u2019t encourage him to try again and improve his cooking. Why not provide him with some tips, or perhaps recommend him a cooking class or workshop? Maybe one you can even attend together. That sounds like a positively reinforcing activity for your relationship.", "I'm going against the grain with NAH.  You shouldn't be forced into eating food that you find utterly unappetizing, especially on your birthday.  You said you stated that it was a nice gesture but you didn't want to eat it.  I don't eat fish (or really any seafood), I'm not willing these days to even try it. If someone I knew tried making me it for dinner, when they know I don't like it, I would also refuse to eat it.  I don't ever eat food I don't like, period. We don't do much to celebrate birthdays, BUT the birthday person always picks what dinner is, how it's made, etc.  I get that his feelings are hurt, so his reaction is somewhat understandable, but so is yours.", "You could have tried it and been more gentle about it.

I can't remember the exact terminology for it but I think its something about \"bids\" for attention. Psychologists say the #1 predictor of divorce is when partners make bids like this and the other partner turns away or makes them feel bad. Partners who turn toward each other's bids are more likely to stay together.  Your reaction seems like you don't even respect him enough to pretend to appreciate the gesture, whether you want to eat the food or not.  \n\nI went through many years of trial and error learning to cook my H has never once insulted me or made me feel bad. He would quietly eat as much as he could stomach and then maybe suggest ways it might be better. Kindly.

LOL", "YTA...mildly. I had a similar situation with my ex husband once.  He made me an egg sandwich for breakfast.  The scrambled eggs were still so undercooked that the bread was literally mush. You could tell by looking at it that it was not going to be appetizing AT ALL. I still took a bite, said thank you for the effort but the eggs weren't really cooked long enough.  Point being,  IT WOULD NOT HAVE KILLED YOU to taste his overcooked cheese pies, grainy pasta or liquid pudding.", "NTA he knew he sucked and still tried it, could be a very sweet gesture If he\u2019d stopped it there and not served it. \n\nBut he served it which means that him getting credit for trying was more important to him than getting you something nice, and edible without likely food poisoning, on your birthday was. \n\nHe made it about him instead of you.", "YTA slightly. \n\nMaybe for future reference you could clarify what is actually planned for dinner. Since it was your birthday, you could have gotten away with saying \u2018ooh I really fancy Italian takeaway\u2019 or something like that. \n\nAnd it\u2019s a little mean not touching anything after it sounds like he made a lot of it from scratch. When I first met my bf we were both 24 and he had never cooked a meal in his life. His mum always babied him and his siblings and would never let him do anything even if he wanted to do it. We had the house to ourselves for a week and he offered to cook me food as usually I was the cook. I was delighted and said yes. He made me chilli con Carne. The chilli was out of a can which I would have had a problem with if he hadn\u2019t of burnt it to the saucepan so there was burnt bits in it. And he had never cooked rice in his life so it was pretty much still hard with soft ends. \n\nYou bet I ate all of it \ud83d\ude02 the rice was a little hard to deal with but his face \ud83e\udd7a he was so pleased with cooking me a meal, I wouldn\u2019t have said no if it poisoned me. It would have just been a funny story \ud83d\ude02 I mentioned that the rice could have done with a bit longer and he was grateful I was nice about it. In the end I ended up teaching him how to cook and now 5 years later he\u2019s actually a really good natural cook. He just needed a little help \ud83d\ude42 \n\nI would apologise for hurting his feelings. And mention maybe you could have date nights learning to cook from YouTube or something together and try to eat at home more. You don\u2019t improve on things unless you try.", "YTA. He thought he was doing something nice for you and put in a lot of effort, you could\u2019ve been far more tactful. (Not to mention at least tried a bite of the food.) \n\nI mean, you could\u2019ve just told him you weren\u2019t in the mood for pasta. That would\u2019ve been far less hurtful than your flippant \u201cwe both know you suck at cooking.\u201d", "How hard is it to follow a cookbook or a chef on YouTube to make a decent meal.", "YTA", "He made a gesture of love for you and you did not accept it with grace very poor show.

Why don't you both go to cookery classes together, book it up as a gift but not just him say we both need to learn.", "NTA\n\nIf something is obviously not well-prepared, I don't think you have to go through the charade of trying it.  But thanking him for the effort isn't a bad thing.\n\nDoes your local community college offer low-priced cooking classes?", "NAH.

He put in the effort and he tried. You could have at least tried the food!!!", "YTA\n\nRejecting to even try the food is a response to more than just the meal. It's a response to his gesture. You could have at LEAST tried it.", "YTA. you couldnt even respect his effort at trying? you had to criticize and demean him? bad behavior like that causes good men to stop trying. when you find yourself in a one sided relationship, understand this is why.", "YTA. The company makes the dinner on nights like that. Not the actual food.", "NTA. Eating burnt toast and soggy cereal that your kids made is one thing, but to eat crap an adult made is a hard no.
