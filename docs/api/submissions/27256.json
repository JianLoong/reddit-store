Do you have a dress code for their pyjamas? Are they allowed to kiss?

If it's that big of an issue, put the kids' bed away and get a blowup bed. I think a mattress protector and a request that guests strip their bedding and start it in the washer is probably what as a guest I would find totally normal. I also clean short-term rentals for a job, so I'm sure I deal with LOTS of beds people were having sex in. 99% of the time, people are considerate, and you'd never know they enjoyed their stay THAT much\ud83d\ude09 We also wash everything between guests, so it's not like there's any cooties hanging around.", "NAH.

At the end of the day, there\u2019s an easy solution-just don\u2019t offer his bed to guests. They get the big comfy couch and that\u2019s the only option. Then there\u2019s no problem if they have sex or not, right? And if they question you, just tell them you haven\u2019t set it up properly yet, or keep the door closed, or tell them there\u2019s no sheets, or something.

Needless to say my parents were a little disgusted and sat on that couch a lot less!!", "Wait until their son finds out he is a product of teh sex!", "I just assume if I have a couple sleep over at my house they probably are having sex in the room their staying in. And even if they don\u2019t I take the extra precautions of laundering the bedsheets after they leave.  In fact, I make it a point to change and wash the bedsheets in this house once a week.  I do know there are people who go months\u2026 before washing their sheets.  Now those people are disgusting\u2026.", "They might be assholes, but\n\n1. if the guests pay attention to not make a mess then the host will never know unless they put a camera or microphone in the room, in which case they are definitely the bigger AH\n2. if someone made a ridiculous request, like \"you must do 5 pushups ever hour through the night, house rules\", then you wouldn't, I don't think, be an AH for not doing that and then lying about it. Then again I've never been one to respect authority just because.", "Lol the mattress' innocence", "Yeah some really weird puritanical comments are being left here", "I fear for that poor innocent mattress in about 13 years time", ">There is a logical reason why people shouldn\u2019t sex on the bed;   \n>  \n>it\u2019s not their fricking bed!!!\n\nWhile I think that is a reasonable reason, it's not really a *logical* reason.", "If OP doesn't maintain the expectation that her friends don't fuck in her home, then it doesn't particularly matter, does it? As far as I read into this, it doesn't seem OP is upset about sex in her house--she just doesn't want it on that specific bed. Which I, personally, think is funny.", "Then yes. Definitely establish the rules concerning your son\u2019s future bed. Or if that makes you uncomfortable then just pull out that air mattress and put her on it. Her back pain is not your problem and I know that sounds cruel but honestly it\u2019s one night.", "Por que no Los dos?", "I banged my uncle in my mother's bed. It was awesome.", "Then don\u2019t offer your child\u2019s bed lol.", "I actually broke the leg of the couch with an ex bf. I propped the couch up on the leg and when my dad sat in it the next day it of course \"broke\". My mom was furious with my dad. I didn't confess until 10 years later what broke the couch.", "\"please don't have sex in one of my beds\" is not a ridiculous request. That's a false equivalency. Also, who said anything about cameras? You're acting like OP is an Air B and B host with crazy rules. This is about respecting other people's boundaries and property, nothing more.", "But it DOES seem creepy, weird, and disrespectful\ud83e\udd17", "That is precisely it. I don't really care what adults do in general, and I guess I feel like a guest bed has different expectations from me. I expect guests beds to be used for whatever, and that they know it is more or less, a publicly used bed. Whereas I don't really want people to have sex in my own bed, I don't really want them to in my son's either. \n\nThen again I could also see the argument of they are adults and they can do what they want. Perhaps I am prudish.", "You weird creep ass, it\u2019s obvious most people don\u2019t want random people fucking in their bed", "They said\u2026 \u201cwhy not both?\u201d", "\ud83d\udc40", "oh I just read that part \ud83d\ude2d if it\u2019s his bed I wouldn\u2019t have anyone on it", "I was being too literal and just answering the question asked - \"How does doing something in the host's house that the host expressly requested they not do NOT make the guests huge assholes?\". Answer: if the request is ridiculous, or if the host has no reasonable way to know but conducts inappropriate surveillance to be sure.", "TBH, I think these convos are gonna get a bit weird. \u201dAnd here is where you\u2019ll be sleeping, eventually this will be my sons bed, so no sex please.\u201d\n\nYou May just want to keep people on the couch.\u2026", "Well hold up. They are adults and they can do what they want. But it's your house. That adult rule doesn't extend to your personal property. It's all about the boundaries that you set for yourself. Sure, they can do what they want... in their own fuckin house in their own fuckin bed.  \n\n\nIt's your castle. Rule it.", "Well that's not a very nice thing to say to a person. I'm sorry that your view of the world is so concerningly narrow that you feel the need to result to schoolyard-level insults directed towards strangers upon differing viewpoints. \n\nI bet you're an absolute joy at parties.", "I\u2019m so confused why are you getting downvoted?", "That's fair. My question was more meant as an indictment of the selfish position that someone can and should do what they want while staying in someone else's house, not as an actual inquiry."]}
