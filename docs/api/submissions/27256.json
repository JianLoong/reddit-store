Do you have a dress code for their pyjamas? Are they allowed to kiss?

If it's that big of an issue, put the kids' bed away and get a blowup bed. I think a mattress protector and a request that guests strip their bedding and start it in the washer is probably what as a guest I would find totally normal. I also clean short-term rentals for a job, so I'm sure I deal with LOTS of beds people were having sex in. 99% of the time, people are considerate, and you'd never know they enjoyed their stay THAT much\ud83d\ude09 We also wash everything between guests, so it's not like there's any cooties hanging around.", "NAH.

At the end of the day, there\u2019s an easy solution-just don\u2019t offer his bed to guests. They get the big comfy couch and that\u2019s the only option. Then there\u2019s no problem if they have sex or not, right? And if they question you, just tell them you haven\u2019t set it up properly yet, or keep the door closed, or tell them there\u2019s no sheets, or something.
