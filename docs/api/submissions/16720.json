Or maybe the medical personnel won't hand my personal belongings over to a person just claiming to be a friend.\n\nEta: emergency contacts, medical personnel won't give that info out either and they would phone.\n\nI confirmed the medical procedures with an ER nurse who does this every shift.", "The emergency contact is for the healthcare provider to call yeah. I know how they work.\n\nAnd in that instance no one needs anyone's phone because the contact will be notified.\n\nAnd in the accident case like you're talking about, you (general not you specifically) are probably there on scene already so why not grab the phone then to notify contacts?\n\nAnd sorry that you don't trust even one of your friends with your passcode for emergencies. Maybe you need better friends?\n\nBut there's no reason to demand the numbers of everyone. OP is an adult, not a kid. When is OP's mom gonna hand over all her friend's phone numbers if she's that concerned about safety? Practice as preached, not rules for thee not for me", "Lol\n\nYes insult my friends.  My friends don't need my passcode because I trust them with the numbers already.  I mean I started preschool with some of them 40+ years ago.  My friends are just fine thanks.\n\nAlso who said the mother wouldn't give the OP numbers if she asked?\n\nAnd as for grabbing the phone on scene you are assuming a lot.  First, you're thinking clearly. You think of actually doing it.  2nd its not broken as I already said. 3rd its not on me. 4th emergency personnel let some as far as they know random person root through an accident scene.\n\nMy whole point is the friend for whatever reason may not have access to the victims phone.", "NTA. You need to move out.", "NTA. I gave my mom 2 friends numbers (after asking those friends for permission) and to those friends my mum's number but just because I LIVE IN ANOTHER CONTINENT... So if I have a life threatening event, probably the authority won't be able to contact my family... But that's it... \n\nFirst, why does she need to contact you for any means that's not your phone? You live together, if she suspects you're dead because you disappear for a week, she can call the police.\n\nSecond, you never give anyone's contact information before asking that person if it's ok to give up that info...\n\nAnd third... You're an adult, start setting boundaries.", "I don't think there's enough evidence to say it's about control. My mom is sweet and non-controlling, but very overprotective. She would do this type of thing (I am 26). It's annoying but I know it comes from a place of love.\n\nIt also *could* be about control, but there's not enough information to say for sure.\n\nNTA btw OP.", "Couldn\u2019t agree more!!", "NTA"]}
