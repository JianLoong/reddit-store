It's annoying, but her heart is in the right place.\n\nHowever, this is easily resolved by just asking your friend if you can give their number to your mom. Guess what? That friend says no? That's the end of the conversation.\n\nBecause the phone numbers aren't really yours to give away and out to anyone who asks. It's sort of like a social contract that if someone was cool enough to give you their number, it's under the assumption you aren't just giving it out to everyone who asks.\n\nBut yeah, if your friend says sure, go ahead. I should re-clarify this isn't really your call to make. It's pretty much entirely up to your friend and boyfriend.

We talked about her anxiety regarding me and my remaining siblings. it was overall a positive experience I guess, but it didn't start out that way. \n\nThat said, if she's one of those nosy overbearing she's gonna slide into your friend's text messages, I wouldn't bother.", "NAH you think your mom is silly but emergencies happen at any age and if one does happen to you you may wish your mom had your boyfriend\u2019s phone number and vice versa.
