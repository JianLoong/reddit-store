I\u2019m freshly out of college now, and I\u2019ll tell you what\u2026 my friends whose parents never let them dip their toes into partying, alcohol, weed, etc. were the very wildest ones when they moved out and went to college\u2014coke addictions, alcohol problems, flunking out of school, etc. They didn\u2019t know their limits and submitted to peer pressure like crazy since it was an entirely new world to them without any adult supervision. The ones whose parents were slightly more lenient (like me, for example, and some of my friends) were the ones in college that didn\u2019t go as hard, knew their limits, and had their bearings.

In late high school especially, most of the kids are doing this kind of thing\u2014it just depends on whether or not you push them to the point of sneaking behind your back and lying, or telling the truth with a parent that they trust.", "ESH\n\nInstead of teaching your then minor son about why smoking weed is genuinely unhealthy for a developing brain, you grasped at straws to find ways to leash him over something neither of you seem to have bothered looking into and just both doubled down on baseless assumptions instead. Weed when your brain has had the time to grow and you've gotten a healthy routine in your life? There's nothing bad with that. Weed when you're a teenager and smoking habitually? Not good for your literal developmental health at all. Instead of trying to teach him about the potential risks, to his health and future career and such, much like you would with teen drinking, you refuse to communicate on the issue beyond clucking on about how disappointed you are. Kids don't typically pick up these types of substances just because they're \"cool.\" They'll experiment with them because they think that way, sure. But routine usage? Something further is going on, being masked, and you're missing the forest for the trees here. It's more prudent to get him to see a therapist so he can start having a healthy outlet and construct healthier coping skills for whatever is actually going on with him rather than leaning back on weed. If you're already threatening to kick him out the moment he becomes a legal adult and that hasn't been enough to at least get him to stop within the household, then something much deeper is obviously going on and it's a failure on your part to not address it. \n\nI don't care about your and your husband's debate about which kid is worse. It is downright atrocious and absolutely unacceptable for him to refer to his daughter the way he did. He called her a slur because she's also experimenting at her now adult age? Your son can get into genuine legal trouble, not to mention both of you can end up taking the wrap depending on what kind of trouble he gets in, for how much he possesses and public intoxication depending on where you live. But somehow the real issue with your husband lies with your daughter being sexually active? Something has gone terribly wrong here. \n\nHe didn't suggest anything, he insulted your daughter. In one of the worst ways possible. Would he rather she be unsafe and be active in an unfamiliar space? Because with this kind of behavior that's what's being built up here. Same goes for you and your son. If your son refuses to stop, then he is much safer smoking within the confines of your property than he is outside of your house where the entire situation can seriously escalate. If threats and punishments aren't convincing him to stop, he likely won't be afraid to have a tussle with the law over this and you need to decide how prepared you are to handle that situation. \n\nHow have there never been any prior rules to overnight guests for your adult daughter and now suddenly she's a wh0re in her father's eyes? This doesn't just call for individual therapy, y'all need family therapy ASAP. You need to speak to a professional about your husband throwing straight up slurs around about your daughter. You need a professional to address your son about the fact that there are genuine risks with habitual smoking at his age that don't exist if he chooses to smoke like this when he's older. Y'all need family therapy right now because this looks like a mountain about to turn into a volcano if you don't get an expert in to help improve communication and get to the root of the issues in your household.", "ESH. You're way too harsh on your son, but your husband is also an AH for being so mean towards your daughter. I will say that your husband has a right to not want strange guys in your house given she still lives at home though, whereas your son wasn't directly affecting anybody in his actions.", "Your daughter having the freedom to explore her sexuality does not make her a whore. As long as she's being safe and getting checked regularly (in between partners) she's absolutely fine.\n\nWhat really is a whore? Why is he ok with his minor child partaking in (in some states\\*free the green\\*) illegal substances than your adult child partaking in safe consensual sex?

Weed also has demonstrable negative effects on brain development in adolescents. Your reaction might have been a little intense, but he actually did stuff that was illegal (even if weed is legal where you are, it's likely not legal for 16 year olds). \n\nYour daughter, on the other hand, is of age, and not breaking any laws. You or your husband might not agree with her choices, but it's a different thing. I also suspect, based on your husband's objections, that he's more concerned about your daughter's reputation (and by extension, his) than about her health and well-being. It makes sense to chat with her about where she's at and how she's doing if her behaviour has changed dramatically, but that's not the same thing. \n\nNTA.", "\u201cDrugs\u201d lol.

There are some there is no 100% protection from no matter how safe she might think she is being.\n\nAlso, speaking from experience, casual sex at that age can often be an indicator that something deeper is going on. Getting validation through casual sex is a difficult habit to break, more difficult than stopping pot (I've done both). But your husbands comment WAS gross.\n\nI wont argue the toss on potential long term effects from teenage marijuana use as I've seen it go both ways, but doing it in your house against your wishes is the thing that made me ESH.
