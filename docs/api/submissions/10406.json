In late high school especially, most of the kids are doing this kind of thing\u2014it just depends on whether or not you push them to the point of sneaking behind your back and lying, or telling the truth with a parent that they trust.", "ESH\n\nInstead of teaching your then minor son about why smoking weed is genuinely unhealthy for a developing brain, you grasped at straws to find ways to leash him over something neither of you seem to have bothered looking into and just both doubled down on baseless assumptions instead. Weed when your brain has had the time to grow and you've gotten a healthy routine in your life? There's nothing bad with that. Weed when you're a teenager and smoking habitually? Not good for your literal developmental health at all. Instead of trying to teach him about the potential risks, to his health and future career and such, much like you would with teen drinking, you refuse to communicate on the issue beyond clucking on about how disappointed you are. Kids don't typically pick up these types of substances just because they're \"cool.\" They'll experiment with them because they think that way, sure. But routine usage? Something further is going on, being masked, and you're missing the forest for the trees here. It's more prudent to get him to see a therapist so he can start having a healthy outlet and construct healthier coping skills for whatever is actually going on with him rather than leaning back on weed. If you're already threatening to kick him out the moment he becomes a legal adult and that hasn't been enough to at least get him to stop within the household, then something much deeper is obviously going on and it's a failure on your part to not address it. \n\nI don't care about your and your husband's debate about which kid is worse. It is downright atrocious and absolutely unacceptable for him to refer to his daughter the way he did. He called her a slur because she's also experimenting at her now adult age? Your son can get into genuine legal trouble, not to mention both of you can end up taking the wrap depending on what kind of trouble he gets in, for how much he possesses and public intoxication depending on where you live. But somehow the real issue with your husband lies with your daughter being sexually active? Something has gone terribly wrong here. \n\nHe didn't suggest anything, he insulted your daughter. In one of the worst ways possible. Would he rather she be unsafe and be active in an unfamiliar space? Because with this kind of behavior that's what's being built up here. Same goes for you and your son. If your son refuses to stop, then he is much safer smoking within the confines of your property than he is outside of your house where the entire situation can seriously escalate. If threats and punishments aren't convincing him to stop, he likely won't be afraid to have a tussle with the law over this and you need to decide how prepared you are to handle that situation. \n\nHow have there never been any prior rules to overnight guests for your adult daughter and now suddenly she's a wh0re in her father's eyes? This doesn't just call for individual therapy, y'all need family therapy ASAP. You need to speak to a professional about your husband throwing straight up slurs around about your daughter. You need a professional to address your son about the fact that there are genuine risks with habitual smoking at his age that don't exist if he chooses to smoke like this when he's older. Y'all need family therapy right now because this looks like a mountain about to turn into a volcano if you don't get an expert in to help improve communication and get to the root of the issues in your household.", "ESH. You're way too harsh on your son, but your husband is also an AH for being so mean towards your daughter. I will say that your husband has a right to not want strange guys in your house given she still lives at home though, whereas your son wasn't directly affecting anybody in his actions.", "Your daughter having the freedom to explore her sexuality does not make her a whore. As long as she's being safe and getting checked regularly (in between partners) she's absolutely fine.\n\nWhat really is a whore? Why is he ok with his minor child partaking in (in some states\\*free the green\\*) illegal substances than your adult child partaking in safe consensual sex?

Weed also has demonstrable negative effects on brain development in adolescents. Your reaction might have been a little intense, but he actually did stuff that was illegal (even if weed is legal where you are, it's likely not legal for 16 year olds). \n\nYour daughter, on the other hand, is of age, and not breaking any laws. You or your husband might not agree with her choices, but it's a different thing. I also suspect, based on your husband's objections, that he's more concerned about your daughter's reputation (and by extension, his) than about her health and well-being.

And to end, condoms break, and weed isn\u2019t a 18 year commitment that costs thousands and thousands of dollars, 18 years of weed smoking depending on consumption could cost maybe \n$5000 for most of 18 years because an ounce keeps me okay, smoking every day, most of the day, lasts me around a month and a half and the average ounce costs $120 cdn so $120 x 12 months x 18 years = $25, 920, sounds like a lot right, the average cost for a child is $10,000 to $15,000 for a year, so low balling it a child for 18 years is $180,000.

He\u2019s slut-shaming\u2014and it\u2019s his daughter no less? Under any circumstances, hideous, hideous, but in this case, I would have some very strong words for him. I would also say he\u2019s revealed his true feelings towards woman more generally with that comment. If she is being safe, I fail to see the issue.\n\nSecond, your son. His brain is not fully developed! He doesn\u2019t know what the long term effects will be from this! Fine, let\u2019s put that aside for a second. He is 17. As you noted it is legal for use by those who are 21 or older. 21 \u226017. So regardless of anything else, he is breaking the law\u2014and maybe isn\u2019t getting dispensary grade stuff which could pose extra health risks.\n\nLet me just say that I\u2019m a cannabis user. One of the absolute best decisions I ever made was to not touch the stuff until I got to college. That way, no matter what, I at least had a high school diploma to fall back on. And my brain was a little more developed. \n\nFinally, it is your job as parents to make sure that your children make it to adulthood AND are prepared to survive on their own. It is your job to ensure that they have the necessary life skills. Frankly, if your husband sees no issue with a SEVENTEEN year old using cannabis (and by the way the cannabis that he is using is going to have much high levels of THC in it that what either you or your husband would have been using\u2014if you did \u2014when you were around his age), then he is failing as a parent.\n\nI know that there are minors out there who use cannabis as medicine, but this is NOT that. Unless there is some critical piece of info you are leaving out, like that your son has some chronic illness for which he needs the cannabis, that would be something else. But it doesn\u2019t sound like that. It sounds like he\u2019s a stupid teenager making stupid choices. That\u2019s what they\u2019re supposed to do.

He can have edibles. If he\u2019s willing to do that AND his activity is not affecting his grades, work ethic, judgement (and yes, there are people where it doesn\u2019t.

Y\u2019all westerners have no morals it\u2019s embarrassing and disgusting", "As someone that knows multiple people who were born when their parents were using contraception, and others who have developed other issues *cough cough*\u2019you literally can\u2019t be \u201csafe.\u201d Safer yes, safe? No", "And birth control methods aren\u2019t necessarily STI control ones.", "I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re from but weed is not legal where I\u2019m at, and they most certainly are arresting minors and adults for possession. I recently had to pick my friend\u2019s kid up off the side of a highway because they were impounding his car and arresting him due to a small amount of weed. The bail can be thousands of dollars.", "Weed is legal here, i dont know what to tell you. I feel sorry for americans", "Would you kick them out to live on the streets at 18 for speeding as a 16 year old? Also imho comparing smoking weed as a minor (noone else impacted except said minor) to reckless driving (which can cause someone else harm) is not apples to apples and arguably would illicit a less cruel punishment?", "At the end of the post OP clarifies its legal but not for another several years for the son.", "You don't even know if it's legal where OP is or not. In NY this is probably the smallest deal in the world. Cops wouldn't bat an eye. Regardless, I would even argue that this punishment is severe for drinking, which is definitely worse at that age imo. As a former teenager this will definitely do nothing but breed resentment against parents and make him a better liar. This is an opportunity for a serious conversation, and a punishment of some kind if they'd like, but this is just overkill. He's a teenager, they experiment with this stuff, and if you just hammer him into the ground for it then nothing is resolved.", "The minimum age law is *not* dumb. Weed can negatively affect brain development, especially at such a critical age. He's also learning to control a multi ton machine which even a lot of of-age smokers consider no big deal to drive while, or recently after, smoking let alone teenagers with less impulse control who are less likely to seriously consider the consequences or danger of it. There's also lung and throat damage or irritation but once he's older he's more than able to decide for himself if he wants to take that risk.\n\nTaking away the car for a while and grounding is reasonable. Checking his things every day is not okay, total violation of privacy. Making him pay what was, I'm assuming, originally a gift of half the car payment is also not okay. The parents are breaking a lot of trust here but car issue isn't getting caught by police, it's everything else.", "I think the car part is 100% reasonable. I don't think kids should be learning to drive responsibly AND use drugs/alcohol responsibly at the same time. \n\nKid showed he wants to experiment with drugs. That's cool. He can start driving again after a few years of experimentation when he's learned his limits.", "Weed is totally legal in many states now if that makes you feel better", "I know for sure that it is not legal for minors under 21, because OP said so, and also\u2026common sense. Just because YOU are in a place that chooses to ignore it, does not mean these parents should gamble their future on that chance. And 3 mo this is not a long time to be grounded from electronics and have extra supervision. That\u2019s hardly a punishment more than a practical necessity, he already proved he can\u2019t be trusted to his own devices. And assuming parents have jobs, it\u2019s summer so no school, and they can\u2019t monitor him physically 24/7, so of course they need to restrict his movement and monitor his activity to make sure that he\u2019s not still engaging in the illegal activities that he already knew he wasn\u2019t supposed to be engaging in. They tried trust, now it\u2019s time to move on to verify.", "Yea and honesty if he killed someone while under the influence and OP/parents were aware they are the liable ones.\n\nLet me put it this way. Take the weed out of the equation and say if son was drinking or doing hard drugs would OPs reaction be over the top? No, we'd find more space for the intense reaction. But ppl are defensive of weed and feel it's their right to use. But at the end of the day it's an hallucigenic. We also don't know how high THC levels the kids is smoking. If it's high then he's a huge liability.\n\nAlso let's talk about dad and his reaction. So he thinks sex is worse than drugs? Drugs that not only affect a person's ability to regulate emotions, but affect cognition and has been linked to sperms degradation. \n\nPlus! She's bringing guys home to a safe place! If something goes wrong or someone hurts her she's got family as back up. \n\nFor me, NTA but dad is definitely YTA", "I was grounded for so long when I was learning to drive that I am now a terrible and nervous driver (due to my lack of comfortability).", "It does!", "Stop.  There are no standards for women anymore.   Not worth your time.", "Obviously it's not legal for minors anywhere. I'm not saying that it is. What I am saying is that at most this would get the kid a ticket. I'm not saying its a good thing to do, but I'm saying it's not going to completely demolish his future to be caught with a dime bag. Let the kid live his life and make some mistakes. If him smoking pot is the biggest thing then they have to worry about, they are fortunate in comparison.", "Except it\u2019s not totally legal even in states that have legalized it for adults. You can\u2019t buy with a credit card anywhere because it\u2019s federally illegal. You can be fired from a job for failing a drug test in a legal state (assuming he works since he was able to pay for half his car). If he has a possession record, he can lose scholarships or even not be admitted to certain schools if he has a possession record. I\u2019ve had coworkers from 20-61 fires for failing a random, which were mandatory because we are federal contractors. \n\nIt really sucks because m a smoker myself, but I would not be okay with my kids doing so until responsible adults.", "As a black woman, I know for sure that the worst that can happen if I\u2019m pulled over with an illegal substance is NOT a ticket. And Marijuana arrests are over half of drug arrests, so SOMEBODY is getting arrested, and having to come up with bail money, possibly losing jobs, scholarships, custody, etc. I guess it\u2019s nice you don\u2019t have to worry about that tho. https://www.aclu.org/report/tale-two-countries-racially-targeted-arrests-era-marijuana-reform", "People know that they are taking a job that requires testing so I'm not sure how that applies. I would never take a job that required that and them failing a test they know might occur is a completely different scenario. And a minor in possession is *very* unlikely to derail someone's future in a state where cannabis is legal unless it happens on school grounds etc. which is almost what OP is pointing him too by giving him no other time outside the home. He is more likely to be smoking at lunch. I'm a soon-to-be attorney who has passed a very thorough character and fitness process with a fully disclosed minor in possession record from when I was 16 y.o."]}
