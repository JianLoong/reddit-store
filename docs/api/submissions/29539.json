He proceeded to tell me that I need to inform our younger sister (26) not to attend his wedding. Quick background story about them two: growing up, they were super close but when my sister was in her late teen, she had a little bit of a rebellious phase which my brother didn\u2019t like because he\u2019s very conservative \ud83d\ude44. He then stopped talking to her since then and asked me to tell her not to come to his wedding because he doesn\u2019t want his in laws to see the type of sister he has. He also threatened that he will make a big scene and kick her out in front of everyone! Now, I took a few days thinking about what he asked me to do and I even asked our other older sister for advise and we agreed that since he doesn\u2019t want her to be there, we don\u2019t want our little sister to be embarrassed in front of family and friends! The issue is when I told my sister (who was very disappointed of course but she accepted that) my parents had a go at me and stopped talking to me and were telling everyone that I am the one who broke the family. They kept saying this for years until I had enough and told them that I was only the messenger and I didn\u2019t want my younger sister to be publicly offended and that if they were fair they should have have had a chat with my brother instead of making me the bad guy! I was abroad at the time of the wedding and could have attended but I chose not to and told them I couldn\u2019t have time off work. So AITA and also am I the one who broke our family ties?! \nThank you", "created_utc": 1698096165, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17evjin/aita_for_telling_my_sister_not_go_to_our_brothers/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother should've done it, either by calling her or writing a letter.\n\nNTA\n\nYour family seems slightly toxic.", "NTA - but you have acted poorly here. You should've asked your brother to tell your sister/parents himself, because instead you needlessly put yourself in the centre of this situation, even though it shouldn't really involve you. Also, why did you wait years to tell them that you were just the messenger? You should've said that upfront.", "You should have told him to tell her himself and refuse to be the go-between. Why would she show up anyway if she didn't get an invite? Why is this your problem to deal with?", "A perfect example of killing the messenger. \n\nNTA but dont ever be your brother's messenger again. If he did not step up and defend you during all of this, it shows that he is not someone to do favors for.", "NTA\n\nJust, are you sure that your brother is old enough to get married?
