You think it's normal to live like that but it's not.", "Sin is awesome, I highly recommend falling into it. Cmonnnn you know you wanna", "Best thing you can do is dive head first into it. Please, join the dark side. We got cookies and porn", "Why would you give it to her? Paid for by her or not, it holds your information she has no right to with out you saying it's ok. I would say just stop browsing on the mobile network for anything you worry about, use your PC or iPad or whatever on the WiFi. Mobile stuff is easier to monitor from some companies, WiFi on the other hand most people don't know how to access from their account to find user data, on top of that many cable/WiFi companies don't have that available for the main user to even see.", "Tbh, given the context, it sounds like your parents may have coddled you as a way of maintaining control.", "I'm certainly not hating your parents. It sounds like they're doing their best for the type of people they are. But in my experience their type just isn't compatible with ours. No hate intended", "No one hates your parents because they don't know them.\n\nWhat they do see is their religious controlling views that you have been conditioned and groomed to think are normal and you feel guilty when you act like a normal person but your parents tell you, you are abnormal.\n\nYou are 20, do you have a job?  If you do, get your own phone and plan.  You can keep the one your parents have and they can call you on that but have a second one that you do all your other stuff on.  Not ideal because you will slip and she will find it.", "Sorry, you're taking this out of my league here. I'm not a counsellor of any type and this sounds like a really deep issue for you. My one other thought on the subject is to read through a few threads on here. It won't take you long to find married couples heading towards splitting up because one looked at the others phone content and it's considered not acceptable. It frequently gets raised on here by people who found something like their partner might be having an affair. I am not aware of any community or religion where growing up and becoming your own independent person isn't normal. If I'm upsetting you with these thoughts  I'm sorry.", "Well, then she would probably have just take the phone from me until I did tell her the password.", "You just need to find ways to be more discreet until you are done with college. Incognito mode and that kind of thing. You are NTA. Your mom is a controlling AH though.", "Maybe that is the best thing then? She needs to learn she can't get everything she wants. If you have other devices you can use them to talk to people/make calls still.", "Incognito mode is the way to go. I do not recommend deleting search history on the regular search, because then she will be suspicious.", "Find tech savvy friends that can help you learn to protect your privacy.  There should be ways to thwart boundary crossing  relatives.", "NTA, your mammy has zero business looking in your phone, that is ridiculous. You are an adult. Get your own phone plan.", "NTA incognito mode going forward and delete your history, romance novels are perfectly innocent and not falling into sin at all your over 18 and can read what you like", "Repeating this: learn to use incognito mode.", "NTA. I would consider your mom snooping through your phone as deceitful. She should repent.\n\nAlso, it IS your phone. They bought it for you. If they bought it for them (so that they can reach you at all times and spy on you), then start a gofundme for a cell phone lol", "\u201cShouldn\u2019t be reading those things?\u201d \n\nOP, just because your parents are conservative Christian\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean you are in any way obligated to be a conservative Christian. Or abstain from engaging in an activity- reading- that hurts no one. \n\nThere is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to be ashamed of in reading romance or erotica or even erotic romance for that matter. Also, your not dating or taking part in a romantic relationship does not disqualify you from enjoying these genres of literature. \n\nYour parents are actually stifling your exposure to some truly beautiful literature by being closed-minded. They have no right to dictate your literary interests or close you off from different learning experiences. \n\nNTA.", "This is the way", "You can love your parents and also acknowledge that you are an adult deserving of privacy, and that privacy was invaded. \n\nI love my mom a lot, but she was (and still is) very abusive to me emotionally and mentally. I can point out that she's spent most of my life making me feel like a bad person for existing while also acknowledging that she's done a lot for me and been there through some really painful moments, and helped support me. \n\nPointing out a crossed boundary, or an instance of abuse, is not an attack or a way to say\"they are an evil person/terrible parent\".", "Your mum is invading your very private space by checking your browsing history. That is not a healthy thing for a mother of an adult kid to do. You have a right to privacy, no matter who pays for the phone. She is also not allowed read the mail you receive and it also would be wrong for her to read your diary (even if she paid for it). She is showing invasive behavior and that is wrong. She is TA in this.\n\nAlso she is guilt tripping you talking about \"sin\" or whatever. Sex and masturbation and romance novels and stuff are not \"sin\". No one has to be ashamed about doing stuff like that.\n\nYour mother is inflicting something on you that is detrimental on your emotional development. She is TA.\n\nThat doesn't mean you can't love her or have a good relationship with her, but you need to start setting boundaries and insist that you have your private thoughts and feelings and browsing habit that she can not interfere with in such an invasive way. You are your own person.\n\nAnd if your mum wants you to keep loving and respecting her even when you don't depend on her financially anymore, she will have to behave herself and let you be your own person.\n\nShe can try and insist on making the rules now as long as you're under her roof. But in 5 years time and for the rest of her life she might become very lonely when her kid potentially doesn't want to visit her and see her anymore, because she behaved in such an awful way towards them.\n\nThe thing with controlling parents is that they feel all mighty as long as the kid depends on them. But later in life they will be lonely and miserable if they mistreated their children. They should think about that.", "You're a grown adult woman, if you want to read smut then do that. SEX IS NORMAL. Your parents treating it as some taboo is extremely unhealthy and even more so for trying to control what you do. You are your own person, not an extension of your parents and their expectations. Coming from a woman raised in a Christian household who no longer holds those values.", "You will have to do those things eventually. I'm 38 and I forget to eat if I don't pay attention. It's easier now sense I have a kid and for some reason I only forget eating when it's just me. When I'm home alone things can go haywire but in time you will learn coping mechanisms. Like I have alarms on my phone for things. Everything from times to eat to laundry day. When I was younger I had alarms in mornings for every little step so I didn't forget myself. \nBut it really isn't that serious even if you stumble a bit. World doesn't end if you forget a meal or realise that you don't have any clean towels.\nAbout the phone. I don't know about US but in my country it's illegal to check other people's phones no matter who pays them. You are entitled to your privacy.", "omg we have the exact same music taste \ud83d\ude26 fave taylor album? mine is red and evermore :)", "While I get where your coming from that was in response to specific fears about forgetfulness no where did I say all people with autism will just learn to adult. \n\nI am well aware of the issues many people with autism face with executive functioning. OP seems like a reasonably intelligent and thoughtful person that if her parents had pushed her to try to be more independent she would probably be successful at being more independent. Her accommodations in college are probably not all that great unless she is attending a private college that caters to people with autism, so she is already handling many executive functioning tasks successful unless her mom is still managing her time and schoolwork like she is a child.\n\nMy main point if you treat a child with a disability like they are disabled you limit their potential. If you treat them like like a non-disabled person they learn to trust themselves and may surprise you with what they can achieve.", "Whisky coke and sluts too!"]}
