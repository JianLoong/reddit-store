He should have made his boundaries clear when you were arranging for help, not given boundaries at the moment the help was needed.", "He is showing his misogynistic tendencies by saying that. A lot of men love their trucks like it\u2019s their baby.  They only allow men who are close to him that he trust.

They\u2019ve not driven the larger trucks on the road because they didn\u2019t have the necessary licenses. \nOn the other hand my sister has never driven any of my vehicles and based on what I know of her skills, wouldn\u2019t even be loaned one of my bicycles. \nLike I said depends on the type of truck and the driver. \nIf it was a pickup then BIL may be an asshat imho.

Most certainly it could have been misogynistic, but maybe he was thinking something else.
