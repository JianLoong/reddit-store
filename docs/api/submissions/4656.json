My husband would never claim that I'm not loyal just because I don't share everything with him - In fact, he WOULD accuse me of being disloyal if someone asked me to keep a secret and I instead blabbed it to him (and he would be absolutely right, barring the secret being a harmful one).", "NTA. Being able to keep a secret is an asset that  your husband might benefit from at some point.", "> Brother also asked me not to tell anyone.\n\nWhile I normally feel that you should not keep secrets from your spouse, it doesn't sound like it actually was a secret and furthermore, your brother asked you to not say anything.

I've told them things, that they went on to tell their wife.  And they were like \"well when you said don't tell anyone, I didn't think you meant my wife\".

This seems to be a bigger issue than you not telling him something that was none of his business.", "NAH\n\nListen, I think an expectation that spouses will keep secrets from each other is unrealistic.  I can understand your husband wishing you had the kind of intimacy where you wouldn't. I don't promise to keep a secret from my husband in the first place.\n\nHowever, it's not a requirement that you share everything with him. He might even be untrustworthy.

I'm going to say maybe your brother was an AH for telling you not to tell anyone and then telling his story to your husband himself and causing you two to fight, lol.  Your husband should be a bit more understanding of why you didn't tell him, especially if it didn't affect him at all.", "NTA- but now you have an issue to work out with your husband. How to deal with secrets. Y'all are not on the same page. At the very least this is something that you should try to come to some understanding about in general. \n\nNeither my wife nor I much care to keep secrets from each other but we will when asked. We've also both said when somebody says- can you keep a secret- do you mind if I tell my wife? if they say- I'd rather you didn't, then I have said- is there some benefit to you from telling me then because I like to keep the list of things I'm keeping from her as short as possible, if you can trust me, you can trust her.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NAH.  \n\nI agree with a previous poster who said you could have just pretended it was a new story, but there\u2019s no reason for him to be that upset for not telling him.\n\nThat being said, I immediately tell my husband any juicy stories and he tells me as well. We don\u2019t feel obligated to tell each other; we just like being able to discuss whatever that story (gossip) might be. It never goes outside our marriage. In fact, he just told me some major stuff about some married couples in our friend group\u2026 we talked for hours about it last night and will be breaking out popcorn this weekend, or whenever this shit ultimately blows up. \n\nAlas, I digress. You\u2019re not really under any obligation to divulge information that you\u2019re asked to keep secret but I can also see his point of view. \n\nStill NAH.", "NTA\n\nTime for malicious compliance.

The point of bringing it up is that maybe I don't need to know if it's all that. Feel free not to tell me.\n\nI've been married to my best friend for over 25 years and we talk... a lot..about everything. We don't have much of a filter with each other so keeping something from her is actually quite a lot of effort. I'd really rather not. So, yeah, I'm up front about that. I'm also really happy not to know everybody's freaky level shit. You can't unring a bell. \n\nAnd the reality is, only one time has anybody ever balked at it. And when they told me anyway, I understood why. Sometimes it really is better not to know and neither of us wanted to burden her.\n\nAnd anyway, the point of me mentioning it is that she and I have an explicit understanding and agreement about how we manage this kind of thing. OP does not. It will come up from time to time, so it's a healthy, and to my mind, necessary thing to work out. So, no, it's definitely not bullshit. It's called transparency and it allows us to maintain the integrity of our relationship even without (sometimes) full disclosures.", "I suppose I should have clarified.

You can't just decide that for them.  That is what I think is bullshit.  Its basically you deciding to control someone else's emotions just because you feel one way about her. \n\nI have no problem with your agreement with your wife, as long as your friends know about it and decide what to tell you with full info. \n\nI also fully agree that OP and her husband need to discuss this and get on the same page on where they both stand with having other people's secrets.  \n\nBut again, I just don't think its your call to tell someone that essentially they have to trust your wife at the same level they trust you.", "I'm with the other guy. The \"if you can trust me, you can trust her\" line is nonsense and a waste of words.\n\nJust say that if they don't want you to share with your wife, then you'd rather they keep it to themselves and be done with it.

Because I've learned that some people are \"OF COURSE I'm going to tell my partner anything you tell me\",  and they just assume everyone knows. \n\nMe and a good friend of mine got into a huge fight about that once.  He was telling his wife all my business that I thought I was confiding in just him.  He saw nothing wrong with it.  I felt completely betrayed. I have no problem with his wife, but also, if I wanted her to know, i'd tell her.  Now we have an understanding where if I say don't tell anyone, he'll clarify whehter it includes wife or not.  If I say yes, that includes her, then he won't.", "I wouldn't of told hubby I already knew \ud83d\ude00", "If I was you I'd tell my brother that my husband doesn't know how to keep his mouth shut lol then your brother knows to not tell him anything in the future.", "Ah.

And then we can discuss and usually fill in the rest of the story to each other, or marvel at the differences in the details provided from each side.", "Ha, yeah, I thought so too.  Hence the fight. \n\nThat said, in his mind I was being naive by not assuming he was having those conversations.   He also come from a more conservative family (he isn't really that way anymore) and I think it was just kind of an assumption that everything one spouse knew, the other knew as well.  \n\nIts totally fine now, and we have an understanding.
