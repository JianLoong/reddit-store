Y\u2019all live together.", "NTA. He should have asked but like most parents his mentality is my house my rules everything in the house is mine. I guess it\u2019s one of the downsides of living with your parents. You could always move out, buy your own fridge and food. That way nobody will eat your food except you", "NTA. Get a mini fridge with a lock. Your father needs to stop feeling entitled to things that aren't his.", "NTA. Be sure to put a lock on your fridge.", "Your dad was rude. You didn't handle it great. Buy a mini fridge and simplify the whole thing.", "NTA\nA minifridge is an excellent idea. \nI understand your position. My daughter drove me crazy when she said she didn't want anything when i asked her what frozen food I should order, and the next time I went to the freezer to pick something I ordered for myself, everything was gone. The only problem is that the delivery person comes once every two weeks only.", "NTA he needs to learn boundaries.", "NTA. You\u2019re contributing to the household expenses and buy your own food on top of that. If the food is clearly labeled, your family should respect that. Get a mini fridge with a lock.

I wonder whether a few shrimps are worth it lol", "She\u2019s not contributing. The father pays for rent, bills and almost all the groceries. She just buys a few things; most of what she eats is bought by father\u2019s money. At least that\u2019s what I gathered from his post.", "To be fair, she lives for free. Her father pays for her rent, bills and most of food (at least that\u2019s what he says in his aita post) At this point I\u2019d say that she is  the entitled one.\n\nIf I was her I\u2019d simply ask the rest of my family whether they want anything while being in a shop, \u201chey, I\u2019m buying shrimps, do you want some too?\u201d, or I\u2019d always buy more just in case. That would still be cheaper than paying her own rent lol", "I live with my older brother and the minifridge is my solution too, it works well.\n\nNTA OP (neither is your dad though).

But it made me laugh the same. \n\nI always assumed in any family that lives together it\u2019s obvious who eats what food that\u2019s in the home. Some things clearly are for and bought by specific people. Some are clearly for anybody anytime. It\u2019s just common courtesy to ask before you eat all of something that\u2019s clearly there for somebody else. Even now (I\u2019m in my 40s) visit my parents I always ask them before I eat something from the fridge. Even if I know they bought it for my visit."]}
