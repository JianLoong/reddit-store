You ruined his chances to be an AH to her.\n\nGood job!\n\nAnd actually, you didn't ruin anything for him yourself, he did by being the AH to all his previous girlfriends. You just shared the truth, nothing more.\n\nIt's normal and right that we protect those we love from harm, especially our younger siblings. You did nothing wrong by warning her. That was the right thing to do.\n\nLet him find some other poor girl to cheat on and shout at.\n\nAnd if your BF thinks it's ok to let your sister suffer those poor behaviours from Eric, your BF clearly doesn't care about you or your family as much as he cares about Eric getting what Eric wants", "NTA and I can not believe your father , he actually said  you possibly saving her from an abusive cheater by only answering her questions truthfully as wrong and petty is unbelievable", "NTA\n\nIf your dad and your boyfriend can't see what an abusive prick Eric is then you may need to evaluate the relationships you have with them.\n\nEric has issues but likely has no insight so will never get help.\n\nPeople ask others for their opinions about relationships and people all the time.  You did nothing wrong and your sister was smart to listen to you.", "NTA jealous of WHAT???", "NTA\nEric, who has a short temper, lost it on you for warning your sister that he's...short tempered. \n\nYeah F that guy. You protected your sister from the AH. \n\nWell done!", "NTA I also think you did the right thing. You protected your sister from a cheating AH. After your bfs reaction I would be questioning his morals and whether he\u2019s someone you want to spend your time with. He knows what his friend is like and was happy for your sister to be another of his victims. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Why is your bf willing to throw your sister under his bff\u2019s violence/cheating bus?\n\nYou and your sister - NTA\n\nYour bf and his friend - major AHs", "NTA, YOU LOOKED OUT FOR YOUR SISTER AND THESE MEN ARE MAD AT YOU? \n\nI would rethink my own bf if that was his bff and that was his reaction", "You're NTA.

He then stormed out.\n\nThere's your proof you did the right thing. Just what did he mean claiming you're *jealous*? Jealous of what? He sounds like a loose cannon. If telling your sister the truth about him ruined his chances with her, maybe he needs to take a hard look at himself.", "NTA.  You did the right thing.", "Your BF knows how his friend treats women.\n\nThis is your SISTER.\n\nEven if your sister hadn't asked what kind of person Eric is, you should have told her anyway so your sister would know what kind of person Eric is before deciding if she wanted to go out with him.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You were honest with your sister, who specifically asked for your input. You have a responsibility to look out for your sister's well-being, and warning her about Eric's behavior is not only justified but necessary. Your boyfriend and father are wrong in telling you to keep quiet and ignore Eric's behavior. It's not jealousy; it's being a responsible sister.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nBest case scenario, dude sounds like a really shitty boyfriend.\n\nYou didn\u2019t tell your friend what to do, you let them make up their mind once knowing all the facts.", "notice that it's all the men in this story defending this AH of a guy. You're NTA; you did the right thing and protected your sister.", "NTA\n\nBut if your boyfriend is defending the way his best friend is behaving, then he is capable of behaving the same way.", "How interesting that all the men are protecting the violent man, and all the women agree that you did the right thing. NTA of course.", "I'm so bemused by this. Hypothetically let's say your sister dated him and then he started cheating on her and being aggressive towards her and taking his anger out on her. Then what? Your boyfriend and your dad say tough nuts and move on, your dad is okay with your sister being put in a situation that could harm her, if not physically then emotionally and mentally. \n\nAnd does him not showing up at your house to yell at you prove your point. My guy could have called and asked to discuss, but got called out, hated it and chose self destruct.\n\nYour bf and dad have loyalty to the wrong person", "NTA and you did do the right thing.  Op I think you need to really consider why your BF things you shouldn't tell your sister that his BFF is a cheater when both you and your BF know his history?  Why is his BFF having a chance to date your sister so important?  Why is he okay with his BFF's behavior. \n\nI'd be seriously side eying your BF right now", "NTA.\n\nSo your BF is basically saying you were wrong for protecting your sister? And that you should just let his friend take advantage of her?... hmmm very sus. Big red flag.", "No you are NTA she asked and you were truthful and maybe she asked other people as well that knew him or she had heard stuff about him. Would your dad rather you keep quiet and then watch his daughter be heartbroken when he cheated on her or worse lost his temper and hit her. How would he feel then?", "NTA. Your sister asked for your thoughts, you gave them. Eric is an asshole who just wants to get in her pants obviously.", "NTA but your boyfriend is a red flag, which you are ignoring", "Let me rephrase it for you, \"AITA, for telling my sister the truth and protecting her from a cheater and potential abuser?\" No, no, you most certainly are not. 100% NTA", "NTA and W mom", "NTA-you even warned your sister that the few things you knew weren\u2019t great and asked if she was sure. You absolutely did let your sister decide, and while I would expect Eric to be mad about it, it is very wrong that your BF and your Dad are disagreeing with you. You didn\u2019t tell your sister anything but the factual truth as you knew it. This was not an opinionated response. It\u2019s very weird that your Dad and BF would be mad about this, and it very much makes me wonder why you\u2019re with this BF. He doesn\u2019t seem to mind disrespecting women.", "NTA, slight red flag from your bf though", "NTA, but people are judged by the company they keep. Your BFs choice in BFF says a lot about him. Do you want to be in a relationship where the best man at your wedding is the serial cheater that got pissed he could hookup with your sister?", "You're the opposite of an asshole, you unmasked one and protected your sister. Also, there was a reason she asked...", "Good on you for giving your sister a heads up. \n\nDon't worry about Eric. He'll move on to his next target soon enough. Assholes like that always do.\n\nOn the other hand, I would definitely worry about your bf. He wanted you to keep what you knew about his buddy to yourself and let your sister end up with a guy who not only continually cheats but also has anger issues. \n\nIs this really someone that you want to be with? Someone who sees nothing wrong with the way his buddy acts AND expected you to let your sister date him without a heads up? \n\nI'd have some serious doubts about his character! \n\n\nNTA", "So your Dad thinks you should have withheld the truth about about Eric's history of cheating?  It's \"petty\" to prevent Eric from getting laid, despite his inability to treat women like humans and despite the fact that one of the women he plans to screw and screw over is his own daughter?  Wow.  NTA, but Eric, your BF, and your father are.  Hmm, what do these people have in common?", "Your father needs to start thinking of his daughters as human beings and not future housewives. Holy crap what a failure of a dad. \nNTA", "NTA. & you never will be the asshole for looking out for your sister.", "NTA she's your sister of course you will tell her. Keep her away from Eric.", "NTA,\n\nWhat you did was right, and you might want to rethink your boyfriend choice as well given he is defending a guy who cheats.", "NTA I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through this and you had to find out what kinda of men in your life are.  Your boyfriends reaction. I can kind of understand, it\u2019s his friend. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t care for your sister the way you do.  So I would actually take that into consideration that your boyfriend was OK with your sister being an abusive relationship if it meant that his friend could get some.  But your dad is the one that I find really devastating.  I would actually try to sit down and have a conversation with your dad and ask him what exactly about the situation he thinks is wrong.  I would ask him if he would be OK with either of his daughters been an abusive relationship because that\u2019s what this would\u2019ve been.  Cheating is a form of abuse, and so is yelling and screaming at someone.  Just because it\u2019s not physical doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not abuse.  The fact that your dad was upset with you for preventing your sister from being in an abusive relationship is just not OK.  I think you should try to show him his wrong and understanding of the situation and hopefully that will help ya\u2019ll relationship in the long run. I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through this. I wish you the best of luck. Also, congratulations for being a standup person and protecting your sister.", "NTA and your bf just told you that to him it\u2019s more important that his bff gets to dip his d where he wants than you and your sisters feelings. \n\nYou bf is Not a good person, you deserve better.", "NTA, this is girl code.", "NTA, you saved your sister from dating someone toxic.", "NTA and if you had chosen to not be completely honest, when it came out later down the line that you knew he was a cheater and aggressive everyone would be blaming you for not saying so I\u2019m the beginning.", "NTA. Telling the truth when asked a question doesn\u2019t make you an arsehole. You are apparently surrounded by shitty men that think more about other men (Eric) getting his dick wet than the safety of the women (your sister) around them.", "NTA family first", "NTA that they came and had a go at your for it kinda shows you did exactly the right thing.", "NTA\n\nWTF is wrong with your dad? Most dads would love for insight like this", "You're petty for not wanting your sister to date an unstable person who doesn't respect women? Yeah no NTA", "Nta family comes first. If you would have withheld this information and this guy gave your sister an std then you'd be the asshole.", "So, you're obviously NTA and\n\n>\nMy boyfriend called and told me that what I did wasn\u2019t right, that I should\u2019ve let my sister decide on her own.\n\nthis right here is proof that your bf doesn't think his friend is so bad and wanted your SISTER to go through it aswell... what does that tell you?", "\nYour sister should have not disclosed what you told her and your Dad and bf don\u2019t seem to care about the well-being of your sister. \n\nIf your sister ends up with Eric you will have a problematic relationship in the family.", "You did what you thought was right.
