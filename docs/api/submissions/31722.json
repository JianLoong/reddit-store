Thinking about her rudeness,I would look for a book on etiquette,especially in regards to receiving gifts.  As the gifts are opened,make sure you comment on picking out the sweater because brother has no clue.  But you have to pass if off as funny husband flaws.  And be sure to mention last year with the book.  Remind him he is on his own next year.  Keep it all light-hearted.\n\nBask in the ensuing drama.", "ESH\n\nNTA\n\nGo to dinner and tell your sister in law that her husband sucks, you got her those very thoughtful gifts, and her comment about money being tight was rude.", "Next year tell him \"I got her that coffee mug she really liked.\" And then when he pulls this shit again, let him gift her the pre-wrapped Walmart coffee mug and then show up with the real gift.", "NTA. Send this to your SIL immediately. She, and your brother, are both entitled assholes.", "Get her a lump of coal.   \"Look. I know you're gonna talk shit about whatever I get you now seeing as hownyour husband steals the gifts I actually get for you because he is too indifferent to actually care about a gift for you\"", "ESH\n\nOP at this point you are being an AH to yourself as you allow your brother to take your thoughtful gift you bought for your SIL and present it as something he did.  Please shine up your spine, tell him to go find something for his wife himself and gift her what you bought for her. \n\nBrother because WTH?   He lives with his wife and if he actually listened to her he\u2019d likely have plenty of ideas as to what to get her.  Instead he whines to his sister and claims her thoughtful gift as his own work. \n\nBottom line OP your brother has plenty of time to find a thoughtful gift for his wife.  He\u2019s 30 years old and needs to figure this out himself or he can admit to his wife he sucks at gift giving.", "NTA girlfriend is a greedy wench and has not one ounce of class to graciously accept the spirit of a gift.", "From now on get them a couples gift. Like movie tickets or restaurant or something generic they can do together. No more thoughtful gifts. \n\nYour brother is the AH.", "Stop sharing information with him.", "I wouldn\u2019t get you SIL anything. \n\nBut I do have a question, does she put a lot of thought and effort into your gift?", "NTA - seems like SIL married the twin who can\u2019t be bothered to properly care about gifting her.\n\nAlso, this is on you. **Stop bailing him out and tell the truth! If it\u2019s no big deal, then he should be fine with that.**", "NTA.\n\nGifts are a reflection of love. Your brother clearly doesn't give a shit about his wife.

When she unwraps the sweater, let it drop that you're her husband's personal shopper. People use personal shoppers for gifts all the time so  you woulfn't be lying. Just outing your sainted brother. You can buy her a pair of hoop earrings or something pretty but not too personal.\n\nAlso, stop telling him what you've bought for her ffs! Brother has shown he's a lazy shopper and he deserves the fallout from that.", "I don\u2019t know in what universe it\u2019s okay for people to make such rude comments about gifts they receive. I wouldn\u2019t be getting her any gifts anymore anyway after her petty and materialistic responses. That\u2019s just not how nice people behave. Brother is the AH too. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t put pressure on yourself just bc she\u2019s an AH about her gifts. That\u2019s a her thing. People shouldn\u2019t cater to that behavior.

That would be showing her you\u2019re thoughtful and showing your brother to do his own shopping next year. \n\nJ/K (kinda). ESH because you need to stand up for yourself. You deserve to be respected just as anyone else, and you\u2019re currently letting your brother take advantage of you.", "Don\u2019t give him the gift.  Change your mind.  Say you can\u2019t come up with anything else.  Don\u2019t give two hoots what he says or she says.   Tell brother get your own gift darn it.  Go to the dinner, have a good time.", "NTA but OP, you shouldn't keep caving.  Listen to her words - gifts are a reflection of care.  Your brother literally DGAF about his spouse.  He's copying your proverbial homework.  Why are you bailing him out to your own detriment?  Now you'll hear about how you couldn't make time for family.  You're not helping matters.  You're enabling your brother to be thoughtless and lazy.", "NTA. You could have your brother pay you for the sweater, then go by another one and wrap it up in different paper.

After all, you are twins. :)", "NTA, but you are to yourself. You KNOW your brother put no effort in choosing SIL's gift, but you do. You have let him hijack your thoughtfulness twice and now don't want to see her. Honestly, you should tell SIL what you have done TWICE.

You are twins after all!  So how about getting the same sweater in another color or design?", "nta but why did u tell him what you are getting?\n\nit's sad that he knows lesser about his wife's preferences than you.", "NTA.", "NTA and keep the gift in your name.", "You're all assholes in this situation. \n\nThe brother for how little he seems to care for his wife gift wise.\n\nYou for simply not sticking to your original no, but now want to throw a tamper tantrum essentially because of your choice. \n\nAnd everyone else.", "Same with my dad. He collects a very specific niche and I have no idea what he has or doesn\u2019t have. My brother had already gotten him stuff for Christmas and pointed out an item on eBay he\u2019d love. He flipped for it and loved it. Know what I said?  \u2018yeah, (bro)found it on eBay and I bought it. Definitely a good find!\u2019  Of course I didn\u2019t take the credit.

Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.\n\nI sense longstanding family dynamics are in play; last year was not the first time you rescued your twin. But if you find a spine, it could be the last time. And the thing is, there IS time to rectify this. It's not even freaking December yet. Tell your freeloading brother to figure out how to properly gift his own wife; and YOU give her what you have already purchased. \n\nPersonally, I'd be resentful as hell about the fact that she judged your gift last year as lacking. She doesn't sound very kind. If you really just don't want to go participate in that, don't bail your brother out; just kindly decline and do whatever you want with your perfect gift.\n\nESH.", "#1. Stop telling your brother what you\u2019re getting her\n\n#2 suggestion  Keep family meals. A bruised ego over her comments - even misplaced - isn\u2019t worth losing family time in the long haul.

I know it's good because I used the same brand to eat my hands of this situation.\"", "NTA\nBut you learned your lesson last year,  why are you giving your brother access to your gift again? He's the one who isn't putting thought into his wife's gift not you.  He's using you and you arw letting him.  Buy a cheap last minutw gift and give that one to your brother to give to his wife.

She is TA for allowing herself to be victimized twice. Fool me once\u2026.kinda thing. I will give her the benefit of doubt for the first gift, but after that???

Stop giving your gifts to him to give his wife. He needs to work for his own praise from her. SMH.\n\nNo, no, no. This is terrible advice. What you do is start to think of truly horrible and non-refundable gift ideas that the brother won't realize are horrible.
