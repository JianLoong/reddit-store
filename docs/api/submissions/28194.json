Her father is pretty easy going, so while we don't have much in common, I wasn't really scared of his reaction, only a bit nervous.\n\nThis afternoon, while my gf was out with old friends, I sat down with him and asked him if I'd have his blessing to marry his daughter. He looked really awkward and confused, and asked me a couple of times if I was being serious. I explained that I was, that I loved his daughter very much and would make sure she never needs anything. He said something along the lines of ''woa, I don't know what to say, I was not expecting that''. We were silent for a bit and he left the room.\n\nI was disapointed to say the least, but still had hopes to covince him. \n\nMy girlfriend came back soon after, and recieved a phone call from her mother, who told her I asked gf's dad for his blessing.\n\nMy girlfriend was really angry at me for asking her dad instead of her and that doing so is sexist(which is stupid because the point was to ask her dad to propose, not to marry her by force), saying she was absolutely not ready for marriage, wasn't even considering it because she thought it was way too early in our relationship (after more than a year?).\nShe said she felt humiliated in front of her parents and now she left to sleep at her mother's tonight, leaving me alone with her father whose been avoiding me since our conversation.\n\nI don't understand what happened. I'm really hurt by her reaction and the way she viewed the possibility of marrying me as completely absurd.

These days, couples build a future together. Not be determined by when a man decides to propose. \n\nThat means that if you've not yet talked to your GF about her expectations of the relationship or her desires for the future, then yes the relationship isn't ready for marriage. Do you know what age she's wanting to marry? Have kids or not? How many? What if she's only interested in dating you, not marry at all? That's possible. Or if she's more interested in building her career before marriage? \n\nEven asking for father's blessing is weird, because you wanted to reassure him that she won't need of anything - implying you're going to be breadwinner. Was that agreed upon at all? What about her being capable to care for herself? And be equal partner to her spouse to be?\n\nI just feel like if her own parents were surprised, it's likely they know her dreams for the future, more than you know them. \n\nTalk to her. And listen to what she says.  Really listen.\n\nEdit: typo", "YTA, all of this could have been avoided by having an adult conversation with your partner about future plans. Some people still like the whole 'asking dad for a blessing/permission' things, I find it outdated and it seems so does your girlfriend, something that would have come up if marriage was at all discussed in the year you've been together, along with a potential timeline of when it might be appropriate to propose.", "YTA for all the reasons already stated. But also, even in this post, you called your girlfriend\u2019s concerns over sexism \u201cstupid\u201d. That\u2019s how you talk about the woman you want to marry?!", "YTA\n\nThere are a few things going on here.\n\n1) Why didn\u2019t you speak to both of her parents? Does her mom\u2019s opinion not count as much as her dad\u2019s?\n\n2) Blessing is another word for permission. You even say \u201cblessing\u201d but then say \u201cask her dad to propose\u201d (this may be a nuance of language). She\u2019s an adult. Also this tradition started because the daughter was literally her father\u2019s property until her husband took possession of her. Put it in the same category as asking for a dowry.\n\n3) Cultural clash might be a factor. I\u2019m getting a machismo vibe.\n\n4) Why are you actively pursuing proposing without some kind of conversation with her? Judging by her reaction not only did she not  have a clue, she\u2019s clearly not wanting to get married, and the idea of asking her dad for a blessing offends her. Red flag for openness and honesty.\n\n5) It feels off that you described her as \u201cthe perfect girl for me, she\u2019s hot, caring and smart.\u201d Sexual attraction is very important but you named it first in a  very short list of three things you love about her.\n\n6) You\u2019re calling her opinion \u201cstupid\u201d and you wonder why she isn\u2019t jumping at marriage? Who died and made you the judge of opinions?\n\n7) I don\u2019t know where you live but balking at marriage at 22 isn\u2019t strange, it\u2019s reasonable. Scientific research shows critical parts of the brain involved in decision-making are not fully developed until 25ish.\n\n8) Your feelings of hurt and anger are valid. You feel what you feel. So does your girlfriend and her parents. She told you how she feels and what her focus is right now. Their priority is their daughter\u2019s happiness, not keeping the entire idea of marriage to you a secret. They would be the assholes if they ruined your plan for how to propose (scavenger hunt or whatever). Her mom probably thought \u201cWTF she\u2019s never indicated the relationship is that serious and she\u2019s still in school for Christsakes.\u201d\n\n9) I don\u2019t think she meant it was absurd to marry you but absurd to marry anyone right now.", "she\u2019s 22 and you\u2019ve only been dating a little over a year. \n\nofc she\u2019s not ready for marriage (no hate to those who marry young) \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIt is sexist.

Three years is a more typical dating phase prior to a marriage proposal. \n\nYou don't know her. You didn't know she would be upset by what you did.

The exact timing can be a surprise, but both people ought to have the idea that getting married in the near future is a shared desire.", "1) her father should have no say on wether you should propose or not!

So you are either an idiot or old fashioned sexist.\n\nBesides, 22 is not too old, people often focus on their life or career before getting married in their 30s. Just because she loves you doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s ready for marriage soon.\n\nAnd yes, 1 year may not be enough time, it just depends on your priorities or age.", "The tradition of getting a father's blessing is because women were considered property of their fathers until they got married and then they became their husband's property.

What is the culture you're from? \n\nUsually, when you list things, the first thing in that list is the most important.

I'll be nice and give you the benefit of the doubt that's not what you meant. \n\nYou insulted her is what happened. Asking for the parents' blessing can be really sweet. It does have sexist tones to it, as it comes from a time when women were viewed as property. It doesn't necessarily mean that anymore. However, by asking her father BEFORE having any discussion with her about it, you pretty much brought it to that time period, which is what made it sexist. It's not her father's decision if and who she gets married to. \n\nSee if you can follow me here\n\nHe wasn't expecting that question because she never expressed to her father that the two of you were that serious.\n\nShe didn't express that the two of you were that serious because you have very obviously never had a conversation about where your relationship is and what the future looks like. \n\nYou are dating (or were dating, you may very well have fucked up big time) your girlfriend, not her father. \n\nBy asking her father before even discussing it with her, it came off as her opinion, wants, wishes, she doesn't matter. \n\nBy asking her father before even discussing it with her, it came off like she doesn't have a say for her own life.\n\nBy asking her father before even discussing it with her, you showed her you have very little respect for her.\n\nYou fucked up.\n\nIf this is truly the girl you love and want to spend the rest of your life in you are going tonhave to pull your head out of your ass, accept that you fucked up and make notnonly a big show of apology but be able to quickly show you understand where you went wrong and will not make that mistake again. \n\nAsk if you can all get together for breakfast. Lunch, dinner, coffee, whatever, and talk. The first thing you do is apologize for disrespecting both of them as that was not your intention. If this has anything to do with clashing of cultures, this is where you explain that. Do not do so in a way that makes it sound like it excuses how you went about things. But in a way that shows that's the reasoning, and it was a misunderstanding on how things work. You're young, you haven't done this before, you made a mistake, a big one. If she wants tonget upset and crying and all, let her and don't tell her to stop or calm down. You stay calm and accept that's she's hurt and mad, and this may be the end of the relationship. Express that you don't want it to be. And see if you can do anything to regain what you lost. Even if it takes time, becausenifnshe lost trust and respect in you....if there's any possibility, it will take time. \n\nIf she needs space, let her have it. Don't push. Dont smother her. Don't completely disappear either. You have to make sure she knows you're still there and interested. It's a balancing act that's very hard. You really did put yourself in a shit situation. \n\nLearn to communicate with your partner. Unless you are talking about a surprise party, DO NOT talk to ANYONE about anything you haven't discussed with her. And even a surprise party you should somewhat discuss with her first. Because again, that's the issue. You didn't talk to her about any of it before talking yo her dad. You ignored her and treated her like, well, she was something to be given away, not a person who has free will. \n\nGood luck", "YTA. You're trying to marry your girlfriend, not her father. Ask her first.", "Well yeah, YTA. It's definitely sexist to include her father in this decision when you're not marrying him. It sends a message that she isn't allowed to be in control of her own relationship unless the men in her life have discussed the matter first.\n\nYour second mistake was thinking of proposing without even discussing marriage first. If your relationship isn't serious enough to discuss marriage with each other then it's not serious enough to get married. A year is a really short time for getting engaged. \n\nI don't believe you had bad intentions with any of this, but you really messed up everything. She has every right to be upset.", "YTA. This is 2023.\n\nAlways propose to your partner first. It's your life together.\n\nIf they are from a culture where this kind of thing still exists, you can do the formalities afterwards. That's what I did after we got engaged.", "Dude, YTA, you should have had the conversation first with her to see where she's at mentally. Marriage is a big step. I will say this I don\u2019t think it's sexist to ask Father's blessing, BUT TALK TO YR PARTNER FIRST!!! I think it's a sweet gesture that shows you care about her to her father and that you respect her parents as well. But seriously, dude, have the conversation first with ur girlfriend. You may mind that you both want different things in life.", "YTA. And I hope it\u2019s a cultural thing. \nIt\u2019s sexist because in that transaction, historically and culturally, it\u2019s a symbol of the father giving his daughter to another man (as if the daughter is a \u201cthing\u201d).", "YTA big time. You clearly don\u2019t understand your GF, or the fact that she isn\u2019t her father\u2019s property so you don\u2019t need his freaking permission. If hell freezes over and she ever marries you, she won\u2019t be your property either.", "Have you never talked to your girlfriend about getting married or what the future looks like?  For her to be completely surprised by your proposal suggests that this isn't something you have ever talked about before, which is a little strange on its own.  Proposals usually don't come out of nowhere... couples have generally talked about their future together, indicated a desire to get married, etc.  The fact that she didn't see this coming at all indicates a communication problem somewhere, or that you both have different expectations of this relationship and where it's going, and that's a problem.\n\nAs for asking her dad... again, this speaks to knowing your girlfriend.  Some people still think it's a sweet tradition, some people point out that it has roots in marriage as a transfer of property (i.e. the bride will now belong to her husband instead of her father) and don't like it for that reason.  Again, if you don't know your girlfriend's feelings about this stuff it indicates a lack of communication up until this point that is worrisome.  \n\nYTA for just springing this proposal out of nowhere, never having discussed anything like this before, having no idea how she would feel about you involving her dad, etc.  You need to do the relationship groundwork before you sprint right to marriage.", "As someone who has been in a cross-cultural relationship that didnt work out, I want to highlight a few things.\n\n1. Marriage, especially in your early 20s, is not assumed. You should have discussed marriage with her prior to involving her family. A proposal does not open the marriage discussion, it is the culmination of a marriage discussion. \n\n2. Have a conversation about roles you want in a marriage. Just by this post, I'm going to guess you have different assumptions of what it means to be a wife or a husband. \n\n3. Dismissing her feelings as invalid is a bad start. If you want to keep this going, you are going to have to apologize, clear the air with her, and clear the air with her family, explaining that you only wanted to show your serious intention, and that you may have jumped the gun. \n\nIt's ok to be hurt, but I think you are working off flawed assumptions of what marriage to her might be like and jumping into something that you both might not be ready for. I will reiterate number 2: you need to have conversations about roles. What you want. Do you both want kids? Do you both want to work? Is she hoping to travel before settling down? How do you view friendship in marriage? Are families involved in marriage? Does she want to continue and get a master's of PhD?", "YTA.", "YTA, it's a sexist old tradition which shouldn't feature in modern relationships.

You should have asked your gf first.  If she thought it would be nice for you to ask her father, then ask him.

You're clearly focusing on what you want without really considering what your gf might want.", "YTA. Marriage should not be a surprise, only the proposal. It\u2019s clear you never talked to her FIRST about your intentions. She is very very young, and I\u2019m glad she has a good head on her shoulders. Idk what will happen with you, but let this be a lesson: you have to talk to your partner FIRST about big relationship decisions.", "I don't know where you're from, so if this is culturally insensitive my apologies.... but who the hell proposes after a year?! Without ever having discussed marriage?", "Info - had you discussed marriage? Or the future? or her feelings on being treated like a piece of furniture?", "Yta", "Im going to say there is no AH here. Just a bunch of miss understandings all around. Idk your culture, but asking the father for his blessing to propose is the norm for a lot of ppl, and used to be the norm everywhere. It was a sign of respect. So you were just doing what you thought was right. However, nowadays a lot of cultures have dropped that tradition, so depending where you are, it probably caught your GF's family off guard. Did they need to tell her, no. But they probably didnt know how to approach the situation. And to your GF, she prob felt more like you were trying to buy her/have her dad sell her off to you, and didnt understand she would still have a choice in the matter, even if her dad gave his blessing. The only thing that may be seen ad AH'ish is the fact that its only been over a year you guys have been together. All relationships are different, and again culture can play a role, but generally, most people take more time before deciding to tie the knot, to further build the relationship. It seems pretty fast, in my opinion, so that probably also blindsided everyone. But it still doesnt make you an AH for deciding your GF is the person you want to spend the rest of your life with.\n\nMy best advice is to have a sit down with your GF, and explain your side, and tell them how you feel. But understand that there should be no pressure. If your GF isnt ready, and needs more time, then give it to her. The only thing that would make you TAH would be if you tried forcing it. Just give it time. Good luck OP, i hope things work out.", "YTA, look you should know her well enough to know if she would be ok with this if you plan to marry her. Clearly you don't. \n\nThen you call her feelings about the tradition stupid.\n\nAnd you don't seem to have any grasp on the idea people might not work on the same timeline as you \n\nAnd **you** are *angry?!*", "YTA.

You've been living with her for 16 years and you have a bairn together!\"", "This is a case of \"read the room.\" If you and your gf had discussed the possibility of marriage, she had been hinting at it, etc. THAT is when you talk to her father. Not out of the blue. You're not an AH, just a bit naive. You've now taken things to a place whence they cannot be un-taken. Good luck salvaging anything with her after this.", "YTA. Not necessarily asking her father\u2019s blessing. But judging by the responses of her father, mother and most importantly your girlfriend it was completely unexpected.

I also believe it\u2019s sexist, her dad\u2019s blessing is similar to her dad say, giving her away at a wedding, she\u2019s no one\u2019s to give away. She is her own person. And she clearly expects you to understand that. I think I\u2019d be quite put off if someone asked my dad for his blessing too tbh!\n\nThat being said, some people\u2019s background is a lot more traditional. Ultimately each to their own, but you calling this whole thing stupid is a dick move.", "YTA\n\n1 year is definitely not enough when you are so far off base with this. Some women would find this sweet and caring, others find it offensive, as you've experienced. The fact you never even bothered to discuss marriage or even attempt to gauge her feelings on whether she'd want her parents blessing shows have incredibly premature this proposal was going to be. \n\nThe way you have handled her finding it offensive is also putting the nail in the coffin. You're hurt, angry and confused and saying her feelings are stupid - when you're the one who has caused the problem with poor communication and not knowing your girlfriend very well. You've made this whole post about you and instead of realizing you did something that's seriously damaged your relationship, have immediately jumped on the defensive about how you are right and clearly it's her and her parents who are in the wrong. This is a really immature way of handling the problem. Had you immediately apologized to her father and to her, admitted you completely misread the situation and had a frank conversation about the future, you might have salvaged this. But it doesn't look like you have the emotional maturity to admit you are the one at fault here.", "Hmmm I can see where this all went wrong and although it\u2019s messy, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s AH territory for either of you really. A lot to people on here don\u2019t seem to understand what gaslighting is\u2026 I assume it\u2019s because they\u2019ve never lived with an actual gaslighter, so don\u2019t pay too much attention to that. \n\nDepending on the type of girl and relationships you\u2019re in will depend on if asking the fathers hand is appropriate. I have friends who would lose their mind if a man did that and I have friends who wouldn\u2019t accept until he had asked their dad. We are all entitled to our own opinions and wants/needs, some are more traditional and some are more modern and there\u2019s nothing wrong with either\u2026 and so you have to ask \nyourself which category your gf falls into. \n\nNow let\u2019s say you believed she was that girl, the fact her dad ran to her mum and her mum to her is a little shocking tbh. What if she had wanted to get married and they were ready to ruin the surprise just like that. I\u2019d be pissed at my parents if they did that, regardless how I felt about the situation. I\u2019m guessing by your comment on her staying with her mum and you with her dad, her parents are divorced? Maybe she\u2019s not a marriage person after watching her parents fail. Maybe she\u2019s been raised to believe marriage happens in your late 20s. Your age difference while only 4 years, is a big difference because of the stages of life you\u2019re at. 22 is a im still a student, kinda still mentally young and open to see what the world brings kinda thing. By 26 you\u2019re a little less excited, you\u2019ve been out in the world long enough to know exactly what\u2019s in arms reach and what\u2019s not etc. maybe talk to her about what her ideal age for marriage is\u2026 \n\nI feel like more context is needed? Did you two ever speak of next steps? Do you even live together? \n\nI would definitely say don\u2019t belittle her feelings, regardless if you think they\u2019re outrageous.

You mention she\u2019s hot and you mention she\u2019s got a lot of savings. Would you still think she was the perfect girl if she didn\u2019t? If these two factors are things that make you want to marry her then I\u2019m not convinced you should either. Sure they\u2019re great but neither should dictate her worth. This might sound silly to men, but to women this is a real concern that many have gone through. \n\nAlso - I understand that English is not your first language so i want to point this out. \u201cHot\u201d isn\u2019t a great word to anyone over 21. Sure we want to be seen as hot but when you\u2019re talking about your gf \u201cbeautiful, cute, pretty, gorgeous\u201d etc are better sounding words.

There should be discussions about what kind of traditions/values you want to uphold, including things like if you should ask her father for permission to get married.  You should both be on the same page.  The proposal is simply a traditional symbol of the already-agreed-upon discussions you should have had.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you had any of that.

If you had had these conversations with your GF, you would have known that this was not something she wanted or valued.\n\nIt is rather odd that you would discuss it with her father before you'd even talk to her about it, but I am going to assume that this was simply foolishness on your part and not blatant sexism.

Traditionally women were owned by their fathers and the husband had to convince the father he would be a good option for her before he would be allowed to marry her where if accepted by the father, her ownership would then transfer to the husband once the ceremony commenced (the same reason why dad\u2019s walk daughters down the isle originally this was to show transfer of ownership). Asking for permission has roots in sexism and a lot of modern women don\u2019t like it for these reasons. Some women like to keep the tradition seeing as obviously women are no longer chattel in most countries. Traditions can change for example as mentioned above; I know most women want their father\u2019s to walk them down the isle.

Often times you've even established how long she'd like to date someone before getting married and whether or not she wants you to ask her dad ,etc etc.\n\n\nOnce, you have a handle on all that information and you're about a year out from the time at which she would theoretically want to get married, then you spend a while finding a ring and ask her. In other words, you need to wait until you're all but certain that she'll say yes. \n\n\nThis isn't like when you first asked her to be your girlfriend. The good advice for asking a girl to date you is bad advice for a proposal. \n- Ask her ot as soon as possible\n- be super casual about it\n- don't stress about whether or not you think she'll say no\n\n\nFor a proposal, you need to be damn confident that she's going to say yes and her saying no is a big deal. Not everyone agrees with me on this, but I think that a marriage proposal is all or nothing. It's the big decision: are we locking this in or are we ending it? That's why you have to actually be sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nI (26M) always found that asking the dad seemed a little dated and weird. I can see why many women don't like it. For my girlfriend, asking her dad is an essential part of the process.\n\n\nI know that a year feels like a long time and maybe if you'd met at the age of 45 it would be, but you need to ask yourself how much you really know about this girl. How much does she really know about you? \n\n\nI don't think you're an arse, but you are letting yourself get carried away. It's gonna be very hard for anyone to take a life long vow seriously, when you know so little about each other.\n\n\n\nI actually think the comments here are being really unfair to you. Yes you made a bit of a social miss step, but your I'll conceived notion of how a wedding proposal works is entirely understandable.", "NTA, always ask for a blessing never permission. If she's an Adult (18+) it's her decision to say Yes or No. But knowing the family are happy with it is a bonus. \n\nI asked my FIL for his blessing and he almost started crying.

Do we open car doors? Is that sexist now? Depends who you ask! So for that part N T A.\n\nY T A for how you worded your description and I had a feeling the rest wasn't going well for you when you said she's the perfect girl for me, then the first thing you listed was \"hot\"... Plus you've been together just over a year and haven't even discussed the idea with her yet? First of all, a year is nothing for a lot of people, and not nearly enough time to be ready to marry that person.

You both could have handled it better.", "Soft YTA. \n\nLots of people are saying that asking the father's permission is sexist but I disagree, I think it's traditional.

Na\u00efve but not an Ahole. Not the smartest idea. You ask permission thinking it was the respectful way to do it but most girls of this new generation, especially occidental take everything as offensive,  and think if you ask permission to the father it's sexist when it's not. But seing the life we live in, you should have seen this coming.  To me she is the Ahole here cause she doesn't give you the benefit of the doubt that yes you may move too fast when she wants more time to figure it out but she didn't have to be a bitch about it and think you humiliated her or was a Ahole when you were just thinking that's how you were supposed to do it. Don't waste each others time,  break up and move on.

What did they do to make marriage feel like a humiliating thing? But they are who they are, and you can\u2019t change that now. Do you come from different cultures? I\u2019d sit down and say something like to her - I messed up in thinking your parents and you were expecting of this blessing and tradition.

It doesn't sound like you have.\n\nBut, also, that was a very insensitive and clumsy way for her parents to react. Her father could have told you that he didn't feel it was appropriate and advised you to talk to his daughter about it first. Her mother probably shouldn't have told her daughter, and should have let the two of you sort it out.", "Sorry, the comments are getting out of hand. I dont understand why people see this as sexism when he wanted to ask for her dads blessing?

Her parents suck for going straight to her and ruining the proposal but depends what she is saying to them about you behind closed doors?

Regardless of belief, you should discuss potential marriage with someone prior to asking. As for it being sexist to ask dad first, it depends on the person.

He seems to think a proposal should be a \"SURPRISE!\" moment, which is fine but the person being proposed to shouldn't be blindsided, especially not by their father calling to tell them second hand.  When you rely on the element of surprise and family buy in, it is a way of pushing a marriage and maybe OP knows that if he just talked to her she'd tell him what she has now. \n\nAsking permission from the father is a bit old fashioned but a sign of respect ONLY if you know the woman wants to marry you.

The fact that he asked her father for his blessing before bothering to learn her opinions on marriage is majorly weird, which is why she probably thought it was sexist. He essentially went over her head and asked her family without ever talking about it with her, or he would have known she thought it was way too early. (Especially since it\u2019s only been 1 year.

Why discuss marriage with the (prospective) bride? After all, she's finishing school, now she only has to keep looking hot. The men will make the important decissions for her. /s", "Yeah, how does \"permission vs blessing\" work anyway? If you fail to receive the blessing, would that stop you from proposing? If the answer is no, then it wasn't necessary in the first place and likely caused additional tension for no reason. If the answer is yes, then you've asked for permission.", "That's because historically the blessings go to the one taking over ownership of the woman.  It's a foul tradition.", "Congrats!", "I\u2019m so sorry to hear you\u2019ve been going through this, and upset on your behalf for their rude comments about your weight. I lost 15 lbs in a month this  summer for similar reasons. Thankfully the only people who noticed recognized it as part of my illness. \n\nI hope you are recovered and doing well!", "Yea, in my other post I mentioned that I see it as anachronistic. While that's not the same as seeing it as sexist, it's along the same lines because a father does not own his daughter and she can marry whoever the hell she wants (although if I were in OP's situation I would definitely want them to approve).", "That dude totally has sex!", "You're allowed that opinion, but most people can see the difference between honoring your future in-laws and treating a person like property.", "Then seriously, why *didn't* your wife ask your parents?  Did she not honor her future in-laws?  Why is it always only \"honoring the future in-laws\" if it's a man wanting to marry a woman?"]}
