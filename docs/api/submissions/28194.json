She's the perfect girl for me, she's hot, caring and smart, and we both love each other very much.\n\nI've been thinking about proposing for a while, my girlfriend is almost done with school and I have a good job with a lot of savings. \n\nSince we're visiting her hometown for the week, thought this week would be a good moment to ask her father for his blessing.\n\nI've only met with her family a couple of times, since they live in another city, but they never seemed to have a problem with me. Her father is pretty easy going, so while we don't have much in common, I wasn't really scared of his reaction, only a bit nervous.\n\nThis afternoon, while my gf was out with old friends, I sat down with him and asked him if I'd have his blessing to marry his daughter. He looked really awkward and confused, and asked me a couple of times if I was being serious. I explained that I was, that I loved his daughter very much and would make sure she never needs anything. He said something along the lines of ''woa, I don't know what to say, I was not expecting that''. We were silent for a bit and he left the room.\n\nI was disapointed to say the least, but still had hopes to covince him. \n\nMy girlfriend came back soon after, and recieved a phone call from her mother, who told her I asked gf's dad for his blessing.\n\nMy girlfriend was really angry at me for asking her dad instead of her and that doing so is sexist(which is stupid because the point was to ask her dad to propose, not to marry her by force), saying she was absolutely not ready for marriage, wasn't even considering it because she thought it was way too early in our relationship (after more than a year?).\nShe said she felt humiliated in front of her parents and now she left to sleep at her mother's tonight, leaving me alone with her father whose been avoiding me since our conversation.\n\nI don't understand what happened. I'm really hurt by her reaction and the way she viewed the possibility of marrying me as completely absurd. I'm really angry and confused at her parents for telling her about my plans instead of letting me propose how I intended.", "created_utc": 1696396762, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16zelae/aita_for_asking_my_26m_gfs22f_father_his_blessing/", "score": 278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These days, couples build a future together. Not be determined by when a man decides to propose. \n\nThat means that if you've not yet talked to your GF about her expectations of the relationship or her desires for the future, then yes the relationship isn't ready for marriage. Do you know what age she's wanting to marry? Have kids or not? How many? What if she's only interested in dating you, not marry at all? That's possible. Or if she's more interested in building her career before marriage? \n\nEven asking for father's blessing is weird, because you wanted to reassure him that she won't need of anything - implying you're going to be breadwinner. Was that agreed upon at all? What about her being capable to care for herself? And be equal partner to her spouse to be?\n\nI just feel like if her own parents were surprised, it's likely they know her dreams for the future, more than you know them. \n\nTalk to her. And listen to what she says.  Really listen.\n\nEdit: typo", "YTA, all of this could have been avoided by having an adult conversation with your partner about future plans. Some people still like the whole 'asking dad for a blessing/permission' things, I find it outdated and it seems so does your girlfriend, something that would have come up if marriage was at all discussed in the year you've been together, along with a potential timeline of when it might be appropriate to propose.", "YTA for all the reasons already stated.

That\u2019s how you talk about the woman you want to marry?!", "YTA\n\nThere are a few things going on here.\n\n1) Why didn\u2019t you speak to both of her parents? Does her mom\u2019s opinion not count as much as her dad\u2019s?\n\n2) Blessing is another word for permission. You even say \u201cblessing\u201d but then say \u201cask her dad to propose\u201d (this may be a nuance of language). She\u2019s an adult. Also this tradition started because the daughter was literally her father\u2019s property until her husband took possession of her. Put it in the same category as asking for a dowry.\n\n3) Cultural clash might be a factor. I\u2019m getting a machismo vibe.\n\n4) Why are you actively pursuing proposing without some kind of conversation with her? Judging by her reaction not only did she not  have a clue, she\u2019s clearly not wanting to get married, and the idea of asking her dad for a blessing offends her. Red flag for openness and honesty.\n\n5) It feels off that you described her as \u201cthe perfect girl for me, she\u2019s hot, caring and smart.\u201d Sexual attraction is very important but you named it first in a  very short list of three things you love about her.\n\n6) You\u2019re calling her opinion \u201cstupid\u201d and you wonder why she isn\u2019t jumping at marriage? Who died and made you the judge of opinions?\n\n7) I don\u2019t know where you live but balking at marriage at 22 isn\u2019t strange, it\u2019s reasonable. Scientific research shows critical parts of the brain involved in decision-making are not fully developed until 25ish.\n\n8) Your feelings of hurt and anger are valid. You feel what you feel. So does your girlfriend and her parents. She told you how she feels and what her focus is right now. Their priority is their daughter\u2019s happiness, not keeping the entire idea of marriage to you a secret. They would be the assholes if they ruined your plan for how to propose (scavenger hunt or whatever). Her mom probably thought \u201cWTF she\u2019s never indicated the relationship is that serious and she\u2019s still in school for Christsakes.\u201d\n\n9) I don\u2019t think she meant it was absurd to marry you but absurd to marry anyone right now.", "she\u2019s 22 and you\u2019ve only been dating a little over a year. \n\nofc she\u2019s not ready for marriage (no hate to those who marry young) \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIt is sexist.

Three years is a more typical dating phase prior to a marriage proposal. \n\nYou don't know her. You didn't know she would be upset by what you did.

The exact timing can be a surprise, but both people ought to have the idea that getting married in the near future is a shared desire.", "1) her father should have no say on wether you should propose or not!

So you are either an idiot or old fashioned sexist.\n\nBesides, 22 is not too old, people often focus on their life or career before getting married in their 30s. Just because she loves you doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s ready for marriage soon.\n\nAnd yes, 1 year may not be enough time, it just depends on your priorities or age.", "The tradition of getting a father's blessing is because women were considered property of their fathers until they got married and then they became their husband's property.

The only reason for this is that you never even discussed the idea of marriage with her before asking her father. \n\nHowever, I have a slight feeling that some of this may be a clash of the cultures. Unlike other posts and people who do shit like this, confusion is what I'm getting from your post. \n\nYou said English is your second language. What is your first? What is the culture you're from? \n\nUsually, when you list things, the first thing in that list is the most important. So by saying  you love her because she's hot and xyz, it makes it sound like her looks are the most important to you. I'll be nice and give you the benefit of the doubt that's not what you meant. \n\nYou insulted her is what happened. Asking for the parents' blessing can be really sweet. It does have sexist tones to it, as it comes from a time when women were viewed as property. It doesn't necessarily mean that anymore. However, by asking her father BEFORE having any discussion with her about it, you pretty much brought it to that time period, which is what made it sexist. It's not her father's decision if and who she gets married to. \n\nSee if you can follow me here\n\nHe wasn't expecting that question because she never expressed to her father that the two of you were that serious.\n\nShe didn't express that the two of you were that serious because you have very obviously never had a conversation about where your relationship is and what the future looks like. \n\nYou are dating (or were dating, you may very well have fucked up big time) your girlfriend, not her father. \n\nBy asking her father before even discussing it with her, it came off as her opinion, wants, wishes, she doesn't matter. \n\nBy asking her father before even discussing it with her, it came off like she doesn't have a say for her own life.\n\nBy asking her father before even discussing it with her, you showed her you have very little respect for her.\n\nYou fucked up.\n\nIf this is truly the girl you love and want to spend the rest of your life in you are going tonhave to pull your head out of your ass, accept that you fucked up and make notnonly a big show of apology but be able to quickly show you understand where you went wrong and will not make that mistake again. \n\nAsk if you can all get together for breakfast. Lunch, dinner, coffee, whatever, and talk. The first thing you do is apologize for disrespecting both of them as that was not your intention. If this has anything to do with clashing of cultures, this is where you explain that. Do not do so in a way that makes it sound like it excuses how you went about things. But in a way that shows that's the reasoning, and it was a misunderstanding on how things work. You're young, you haven't done this before, you made a mistake, a big one. If she wants tonget upset and crying and all, let her and don't tell her to stop or calm down. You stay calm and accept that's she's hurt and mad, and this may be the end of the relationship. Express that you don't want it to be. And see if you can do anything to regain what you lost. Even if it takes time, becausenifnshe lost trust and respect in you....if there's any possibility, it will take time. \n\nIf she needs space, let her have it. Don't push. Dont smother her. Don't completely disappear either. You have to make sure she knows you're still there and interested. It's a balancing act that's very hard. You really did put yourself in a shit situation. \n\nLearn to communicate with your partner. Unless you are talking about a surprise party, DO NOT talk to ANYONE about anything you haven't discussed with her. And even a surprise party you should somewhat discuss with her first. Because again, that's the issue. You didn't talk to her about any of it before talking yo her dad. You ignored her and treated her like, well, she was something to be given away, not a person who has free will. \n\nGood luck", "YTA. You're trying to marry your girlfriend, not her father. Ask her first.", "Well yeah, YTA. It's definitely sexist to include her father in this decision when you're not marrying him. It sends a message that she isn't allowed to be in control of her own relationship unless the men in her life have discussed the matter first.\n\nYour second mistake was thinking of proposing without even discussing marriage first. If your relationship isn't serious enough to discuss marriage with each other then it's not serious enough to get married. A year is a really short time for getting engaged. \n\nI don't believe you had bad intentions with any of this, but you really messed up everything. She has every right to be upset.", "YTA. This is 2023.\n\nAlways propose to your partner first. It's your life together.\n\nIf they are from a culture where this kind of thing still exists, you can do the formalities afterwards. That's what I did after we got engaged.", "Dude, YTA, you should have had the conversation first with her to see where she's at mentally. Marriage is a big step. I will say this I don\u2019t think it's sexist to ask Father's blessing, BUT TALK TO YR PARTNER FIRST!!! I think it's a sweet gesture that shows you care about her to her father and that you respect her parents as well. But seriously, dude, have the conversation first with ur girlfriend. You may mind that you both want different things in life.", "YTA. And I hope it\u2019s a cultural thing. \nIt\u2019s sexist because in that transaction, historically and culturally, it\u2019s a symbol of the father giving his daughter to another man (as if the daughter is a \u201cthing\u201d).", "YTA big time. You clearly don\u2019t understand your GF, or the fact that she isn\u2019t her father\u2019s property so you don\u2019t need his freaking permission. If hell freezes over and she ever marries you, she won\u2019t be your property either.", "Have you never talked to your girlfriend about getting married or what the future looks like?  For her to be completely surprised by your proposal suggests that this isn't something you have ever talked about before, which is a little strange on its own.  Proposals usually don't come out of nowhere... couples have generally talked about their future together, indicated a desire to get married, etc.  The fact that she didn't see this coming at all indicates a communication problem somewhere, or that you both have different expectations of this relationship and where it's going, and that's a problem.\n\nAs for asking her dad... again, this speaks to knowing your girlfriend.  Some people still think it's a sweet tradition, some people point out that it has roots in marriage as a transfer of property (i.e. the bride will now belong to her husband instead of her father) and don't like it for that reason.  Again, if you don't know your girlfriend's feelings about this stuff it indicates a lack of communication up until this point that is worrisome.  \n\nYTA for just springing this proposal out of nowhere, never having discussed anything like this before, having no idea how she would feel about you involving her dad, etc.  You need to do the relationship groundwork before you sprint right to marriage.", "As someone who has been in a cross-cultural relationship that didnt work out, I want to highlight a few things.\n\n1. Marriage, especially in your early 20s, is not assumed. You should have discussed marriage with her prior to involving her family. A proposal does not open the marriage discussion, it is the culmination of a marriage discussion. \n\n2. Have a conversation about roles you want in a marriage. Just by this post, I'm going to guess you have different assumptions of what it means to be a wife or a husband. \n\n3. Dismissing her feelings as invalid is a bad start. If you want to keep this going, you are going to have to apologize, clear the air with her, and clear the air with her family, explaining that you only wanted to show your serious intention, and that you may have jumped the gun. \n\nIt's ok to be hurt, but I think you are working off flawed assumptions of what marriage to her might be like and jumping into something that you both might not be ready for. I will reiterate number 2: you need to have conversations about roles. What you want. Do you both want kids? Do you both want to work? Is she hoping to travel before settling down? How do you view friendship in marriage? Are families involved in marriage? Does she want to continue and get a master's of PhD?", "YTA.", "YTA, it's a sexist old tradition which shouldn't feature in modern relationships.

You should have asked your gf first.  If she thought it would be nice for you to ask her father, then ask him.

You're clearly focusing on what you want without really considering what your gf might want.", "YTA. Marriage should not be a surprise, only the proposal. It\u2019s clear you never talked to her FIRST about your intentions. She is very very young, and I\u2019m glad she has a good head on her shoulders. Idk what will happen with you, but let this be a lesson: you have to talk to your partner FIRST about big relationship decisions.", "I don't know where you're from, so if this is culturally insensitive my apologies.... but who the hell proposes after a year?! Without ever having discussed marriage?", "Info - had you discussed marriage? Or the future? or her feelings on being treated like a piece of furniture?", "Yta", "Im going to say there is no AH here. Just a bunch of miss understandings all around. Idk your culture, but asking the father for his blessing to propose is the norm for a lot of ppl, and used to be the norm everywhere. It was a sign of respect. So you were just doing what you thought was right. However, nowadays a lot of cultures have dropped that tradition, so depending where you are, it probably caught your GF's family off guard. Did they need to tell her, no. But they probably didnt know how to approach the situation. And to your GF, she prob felt more like you were trying to buy her/have her dad sell her off to you, and didnt understand she would still have a choice in the matter, even if her dad gave his blessing. The only thing that may be seen ad AH'ish is the fact that its only been over a year you guys have been together. All relationships are different, and again culture can play a role, but generally, most people take more time before deciding to tie the knot, to further build the relationship. It seems pretty fast, in my opinion, so that probably also blindsided everyone. But it still doesnt make you an AH for deciding your GF is the person you want to spend the rest of your life with.\n\nMy best advice is to have a sit down with your GF, and explain your side, and tell them how you feel. But understand that there should be no pressure. If your GF isnt ready, and needs more time, then give it to her. The only thing that would make you TAH would be if you tried forcing it. Just give it time. Good luck OP, i hope things work out.", "YTA, look you should know her well enough to know if she would be ok with this if you plan to marry her. Clearly you don't. \n\nThen you call her feelings about the tradition stupid.\n\nAnd you don't seem to have any grasp on the idea people might not work on the same timeline as you \n\nAnd **you** are *angry?!*", "YTA.

Not out of the blue. You're not an AH, just a bit naive. You've now taken things to a place whence they cannot be un-taken. Good luck salvaging anything with her after this.", "YTA. Not necessarily asking her father\u2019s blessing. But judging by the responses of her father, mother and most importantly your girlfriend it was completely unexpected.

I also believe it\u2019s sexist, her dad\u2019s blessing is similar to her dad say, giving her away at a wedding, she\u2019s no one\u2019s to give away. She is her own person. And she clearly expects you to understand that. I think I\u2019d be quite put off if someone asked my dad for his blessing too tbh!\n\nThat being said, some people\u2019s background is a lot more traditional. Ultimately each to their own, but you calling this whole thing stupid is a dick move.", "YTA\n\n1 year is definitely not enough when you are so far off base with this. Some women would find this sweet and caring, others find it offensive, as you've experienced. The fact you never even bothered to discuss marriage or even attempt to gauge her feelings on whether she'd want her parents blessing shows have incredibly premature this proposal was going to be. \n\nThe way you have handled her finding it offensive is also putting the nail in the coffin. You're hurt, angry and confused and saying her feelings are stupid - when you're the one who has caused the problem with poor communication and not knowing your girlfriend very well. You've made this whole post about you and instead of realizing you did something that's seriously damaged your relationship, have immediately jumped on the defensive about how you are right and clearly it's her and her parents who are in the wrong. This is a really immature way of handling the problem. Had you immediately apologized to her father and to her, admitted you completely misread the situation and had a frank conversation about the future, you might have salvaged this. But it doesn't look like you have the emotional maturity to admit you are the one at fault here.", "Hmmm I can see where this all went wrong and although it\u2019s messy, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s AH territory for either of you really. A lot to people on here don\u2019t seem to understand what gaslighting is\u2026 I assume it\u2019s because they\u2019ve never lived with an actual gaslighter, so don\u2019t pay too much attention to that. \n\nDepending on the type of girl and relationships you\u2019re in will depend on if asking the fathers hand is appropriate. I have friends who would lose their mind if a man did that and I have friends who wouldn\u2019t accept until he had asked their dad. We are all entitled to our own opinions and wants/needs, some are more traditional and some are more modern and there\u2019s nothing wrong with either\u2026 and so you have to ask \nyourself which category your gf falls into. \n\nNow let\u2019s say you believed she was that girl, the fact her dad ran to her mum and her mum to her is a little shocking tbh. What if she had wanted to get married and they were ready to ruin the surprise just like that. I\u2019d be pissed at my parents if they did that, regardless how I felt about the situation. I\u2019m guessing by your comment on her staying with her mum and you with her dad, her parents are divorced? Maybe she\u2019s not a marriage person after watching her parents fail. Maybe she\u2019s been raised to believe marriage happens in your late 20s. Your age difference while only 4 years, is a big difference because of the stages of life you\u2019re at. 22 is a im still a student, kinda still mentally young and open to see what the world brings kinda thing. By 26 you\u2019re a little less excited, you\u2019ve been out in the world long enough to know exactly what\u2019s in arms reach and what\u2019s not etc. maybe talk to her about what her ideal age for marriage is\u2026 \n\nI feel like more context is needed? Did you two ever speak of next steps? Do you even live together? \n\nI would definitely say don\u2019t belittle her feelings, regardless if you think they\u2019re outrageous.

You mention she\u2019s hot and you mention she\u2019s got a lot of savings. Would you still think she was the perfect girl if she didn\u2019t? If these two factors are things that make you want to marry her then I\u2019m not convinced you should either. Sure they\u2019re great but neither should dictate her worth. This might sound silly to men, but to women this is a real concern that many have gone through. \n\nAlso - I understand that English is not your first language so i want to point this out. \u201cHot\u201d isn\u2019t a great word to anyone over 21. Sure we want to be seen as hot but when you\u2019re talking about your gf \u201cbeautiful, cute, pretty, gorgeous\u201d etc are better sounding words.

There should be discussions about what kind of traditions/values you want to uphold, including things like if you should ask her father for permission to get married.

Traditionally women were owned by their fathers and the husband had to convince the father he would be a good option for her before he would be allowed to marry her where if accepted by the father, her ownership would then transfer to the husband once the ceremony commenced (the same reason why dad\u2019s walk daughters down the isle originally this was to show transfer of ownership). Asking for permission has roots in sexism and a lot of modern women don\u2019t like it for these reasons. Some women like to keep the tradition seeing as obviously women are no longer chattel in most countries. Traditions can change for example as mentioned above; I know most women want their father\u2019s to walk them down the isle.

Etc etc. These discussions are generally framed as jovial imaginings, but once you've had a few of these conversations you've inadvertently established that marriage is on the table. Often times you've even established how long she'd like to date someone before getting married and whether or not she wants you to ask her dad ,etc etc.\n\n\nOnce, you have a handle on all that information and you're about a year out from the time at which she would theoretically want to get married, then you spend a while finding a ring and ask her. In other words, you need to wait until you're all but certain that she'll say yes. \n\n\nThis isn't like when you first asked her to be your girlfriend. The good advice for asking a girl to date you is bad advice for a proposal. \n- Ask her ot as soon as possible\n- be super casual about it\n- don't stress about whether or not you think she'll say no\n\n\nFor a proposal, you need to be damn confident that she's going to say yes and her saying no is a big deal. Not everyone agrees with me on this, but I think that a marriage proposal is all or nothing. It's the big decision: are we locking this in or are we ending it? That's why you have to actually be sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nI (26M) always found that asking the dad seemed a little dated and weird. I can see why many women don't like it. For my girlfriend, asking her dad is an essential part of the process.\n\n\nI know that a year feels like a long time and maybe if you'd met at the age of 45 it would be, but you need to ask yourself how much you really know about this girl. How much does she really know about you? \n\n\nI don't think you're an arse, but you are letting yourself get carried away. It's gonna be very hard for anyone to take a life long vow seriously, when you know so little about each other.\n\n\n\nI actually think the comments here are being really unfair to you. Yes you made a bit of a social miss step, but your I'll conceived notion of how a wedding proposal works is entirely understandable.", "NTA, always ask for a blessing never permission. If she's an Adult (18+) it's her decision to say Yes or No. But knowing the family are happy with it is a bonus. \n\nI asked my FIL for his blessing and he almost started crying. He never expected anyone to ask him especially for his first daughter. That and 6 pints helped too \ud83d\ude02.", "I\u2019m gonna say NAH. Some people do the tradition of asking the father of the person their proposing to and that\u2019s okay if you like that tradition.

Also only a year of dating does seem kind of early to me.", "I mean this whole thing is why I refuse to date, with all the lose lose scenarios out there. Men are picked apart for not being chivalrous and asking the father's permission, but also roasted for sexism if we do. Who the hell even knows what we're supposed to do anymore? Do we open car doors? Is that sexist now? Depends who you ask! So for that part N T A.\n\nY T A for how you worded your description and I had a feeling the rest wasn't going well for you when you said she's the perfect girl for me, then the first thing you listed was \"hot\"... Plus you've been together just over a year and haven't even discussed the idea with her yet? First of all, a year is nothing for a lot of people, and not nearly enough time to be ready to marry that person. Also, you should have had these discussions with her to find out if she even wants to get married to begin with. \n\nSo I'm going ESH. You both could have handled it better.", "Soft YTA. \n\nLots of people are saying that asking the father's permission is sexist but I disagree, I think it's traditional. Though I think asking both parents would have been better than just her father.\n\nMy wife would have been upset had I proposed to her without speaking to her parents first.\n\nWhere you fucked up was planning to propose to a 22 year old after only dating for a year without discussing marriage with her first.", "NTA. Na\u00efve but not an Ahole. Not the smartest idea. You ask permission thinking it was the respectful way to do it but most girls of this new generation, especially occidental take everything as offensive,  and think if you ask permission to the father it's sexist when it's not. But seing the life we live in, you should have seen this coming.  To me she is the Ahole here cause she doesn't give you the benefit of the doubt that yes you may move too fast when she wants more time to figure it out but she didn't have to be a bitch about it and think you humiliated her or was a Ahole when you were just thinking that's how you were supposed to do it. Don't waste each others time,  break up and move on. And next time go for a more traditional girl, you say English isn't your mother tongue , assuming your gf was an american or just someone outside your culture, try dating from you own community (to avoid that kind of reaction and misunderstanding and most importantly to have the same view and value)", "And don\u2019t get caught up on whether it is or isn\u2019t sexist, it doesn\u2019t matter as much as understanding she didn\u2019t like that route. You misjudged and thought her family were part of that tradition. Now you know. I would be angry at the parents as well, especially as she is embarrassed in front of them? What did they do to make marriage feel like a humiliating thing? But they are who they are, and you can\u2019t change that now. Do you come from different cultures? I\u2019d sit down and say something like to her - I messed up in thinking your parents and you were expecting of this blessing and tradition. I never wanted and am surprised you feel embarrassed by marriage. I love you and it\u2019s a good point to understand each others expectations.", "NTA! What you did is very refreshing and sweet for today's generations HOWEVER, it is waaaaay too early. Being together for over a year is not a long period of time AT ALL. Her reaction, as well as her dad's, is justified.", "ESH (except your ex-girlfriend)\n\nA year is a short period of time to be dating someone before proposing to them. You don't know her that well yet (clearly) and you're both pretty young. Have you even talked to her about marriage, whether she wants to get married one day, what her life plans are? It doesn't sound like you have.\n\nBut, also, that was a very insensitive and clumsy way for her parents to react. Her father could have told you that he didn't feel it was appropriate and advised you to talk to his daughter about it first. Her mother probably shouldn't have told her daughter, and should have let the two of you sort it out.", "Sorry, the comments are getting out of hand. I dont understand why people see this as sexism when he wanted to ask for her dads blessing? Maybe the mum is not there, so he only asked the dad? \nSo many people still like it traditionally, want their partners to ask for their parents blessing first, also to make sure that they approve the relationship. I see nothing wrong with it, it might be sexist years ago where women were seen as property but today its not.\n\nThe only thing I would have done differently is to discuss marriage beforehand with your girlfriend to know the timeline when she would like to get married or if she even wants to.", "NTA. This is a very respectful gesture in some cultures and the SOP. It's old-fashioned, sure, but some girls are into that. Your GF obviously isn't one of them and neither is her family. But why didn't you know that about her? I feel like you've been very oblivious or willfully blind. Find a girl (and a family) who appreciates this. Less friction on your union if you have shared values.", "NAH. You are asking blessings. Not permission.\nBut Buddy. Best to wait 5 years to properly know someone before marriage.", "Not the asshole.  For many people this is seen as a gesture of respect for the parents.  Having your dad walk you down the aisle/give you away is also \"sexist\" yet many still do that as well.  \n\nIf this is not something the two of you can work through then a marriage is out of the question at any time, and it's best you find that out now.  And, honestly, 22 is kind of young.", "That action might make me the asshole because I didn't ask her first", "NTA such a normal thing to do. Libs have ruined the world. You should be respected for showing respect to your partner and her dad.", "NTA you just were on a different page from your gf and didn\u2019t realise it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s sexist (I\u2019m female) but also wouldn\u2019t want my dads permission to be sought because he has no impact on my choices, and it feels like he\u2019s being given some type of control as to if he says he\u2019s or no what that then means for my life. You need to have a calm chat with your gf about how you both have different perspectives and come from different angles at the relationship. And that\u2019s fine. But moving forward how can you align to best get on the same track. It\u2019s a good convo to have so you both have your expectations met and if your lifestyles are compatible - do you guys want to marry at some point of all goes well? When might that be? Do you want to live abroad? Holiday? Children at what age etc?", "NSH - But maybe you should have talked about marriage with yout GF before you asked for her father's blessing.

Without knowing everyone involved it\u2019s hard to judge. I get where she is coming from I\u2019d be disappointed if my partner asked my dad? Especially if they asked only my dad and not my mum? In saying that I\u2019m not property so there is that. Surely your gf has views that would align with you not wanting to ask her dad? Her parents suck for going straight to her and ruining the proposal but depends what she is saying to them about you behind closed doors? I feel like your gf maybe went nuclear on this and leaving to stay with her mum and you alone with her dad in another city instead of having a mature conversation?

She\u2019s right, over a year isn\u2019t a long time for that sort of decision and I\u2019m glad she\u2019s smart enough to think that way. And second yes it is sexist and misogynistic. The whole idea of asking her father is rooted in the fact that women are property and belong to someone. First she belonged to her father and you have to ask his permission to marry her so that she can become your property. It\u2019s arbitrary and even women taking men\u2019s last name is rooted in the same belief that women are property. She has every right to be anger.

You mentioned English as a second language, what culture did you grow up with? \n\nAnother question, are her parents together or separated?\n\nIt is a really nice gesture to ask the parents for permission, but this should be long after you have this conversation with your girlfriend. Proposals should never be a complete surprise, meaning that you should have talked to your girlfriend about marriage and the idea of getting engaged to feel things out before talking to her parents about it. Also, one year is quite a short time in the grand scheme of things to propose to someone.

Regardless of belief, you should discuss potential marriage with someone prior to asking. As for it being sexist to ask dad first, it depends on the person. Some girls love the idea, others, like me, do find the notion sexist (I believe it to be because I am the one meeting, not him, permission was needed because girls were considered their fathers property, and I personally would say no if my boyfriend asked my dad first, my boyfriend knows this though). Long story short, it depends on the person, but it is a discussion you souls have had with her, first", "YTA - its 2023 and asking the father's permission to propose is a horrible meaningless tradition.

That is why it's bad. It is still a remnant from the time when women were property. Not allowed to propose? What utter bull. That IS misogynistic af.", "I'm not really understanding people's responses here saying \"there doesn't need to be a blessing, she can choose for herself\"??\n\nThe blessing is not for the daughter?? It's for OP. When a man asks the father for their blessing to propose to their daughter it's literally a polite way of asking \"can I marry your daughter? Is that okay?\"\n\nThey're basically asking the dad if they're \"dad approved\". It would suck to marry your partner and know your dad will never like them or they never approved of your partner (in some cultures). And yes, I agree the daughter can still marry whoever she likes because it's her life but if you have a tight-knit family or are very close to your dad....then that would hurt.", "This sub is like the new femaledatingstrategy.", "I mean sure if you wanna take all the showmanship out of my comment", "Yeahh it's hard to translate months worth of emotional manipulation into a post but I tried my best!", "It is viscerally annoying that this happens with actual medical terms. \"Literally\" becoming \"emphatically figuratively\" is annoying but acceptable, but psychiatric terms suffering this watering down is almost painful to watch because suddenly they're a catch all for mild AND serious things and it's hard to differentiate because people would rather look clever and use the long word than admit they don't know how to read a dictionary", "Good bot.", "This", "this", "You\u2019re coming off as defensive and not trying to understand the opinions you asked for.", "Did you tell her it isn't sexist?", "You keep pushing back when people point this out.

That's just how language works. It's an awkward trend with \"gaslighting\" though because the real (or perhaps, original) meaning refers to something intentional and malicious so it's a relatively serious accusation to some. Just a pattern I've noticed lately.", "[deleted]", "Getting confirmation the family likes you before becoming part of it is very handy.

It only shows people being close minded and not open to other opinions and traditions.", "It is - by definition - a cultural tradition.\n\n\nYou can take any part of marriage and argue that it's \"obviously sexist\" if you want.\n\n\n> oh my god! You're giving her a bribe while you ask for her hand in marriage? How sexist of you to assume that when can be bought with material goods?\n\n\n=\n\n\n> Oh my god! You're dad is walking you down the aisle to \"give you away\"? It's awfully sexist of you to imply that men have ownership over women!\n\n\n=\n\n\n> oh my god! Your dad is giving a speech at the wedding but your mum isn't? Talk about silencing women!\n\n\nTraditions don't have to be this calculated logic puzzle that's treats every person exactly the same. Brides throw a bouquet, grooms generally don't. Men have to buy a ring and propose, women generally don't. Your mother in law gets to wear a funny hat, your father in law has to give a speech.\n\n\nThese are just traditions and it's really not the end of the world which person wears a funny hat or who gets to shake hands with the boyfriend before he pops the question.

You might, it doesn't mean everyone does.", "Ye i thought you were the other commenter that told me to gk to a cave or whatever. \n\nI dont live there but my family is from a rural place. When 2 people decide to get married they ask their parents. Its more of a test than an ask for blessing. The guy spends time with her dad so he can see how he is. Is he prone to anger , can he provide......... the woman spends time with his mom or grandma to see how she dels with wife duties and stuff like that. \n\nThe reason why the dads approval is needed more is because the man does the proposing and its more dangerous for a woman to go to some violent good for nothing.\n\nI know its cringe, outdated whatever but the leftovers of that culture is probably why the ask for blessing. Its not to buy a woman or make her your property. I literally have family that got married like this. \n\nI also think its misplaced and weird but to claim that he is a misogynist for asking the father for blessing is just \"frothing\" at a man for existing.\n\nIs he kind of a dunce for not talking to her like an adult before dropping the ring bomb, yeah ofc.

I'm not saying you have to justify yourself to me, but I think it's worth interrogating traditions like this. \n\n\nYour original comment was specifically written as \"asking the father is a sign of respect\" and you did not answer my questions. \n\nYou don't have to answer me, to be clear, but I wanted you to understand why people are rejecting this tradition. \n\nYour response to me said both parents were there, and the way it's written makes it sound like you were telling them you were proposing to her. What if they didn't approve? What if they wanted you to wait? Was her mother's approval as crucial or equally important as her father's? \n\nThe idea that you need or seek a father's approval for marrying his daughter is rooted in patriarchy, full stop.
