We have talked and know that we are not exclusive or ready for titles, but we have discussed that we are sexually exclusive.\n\nWhen I first became sexually active I thought it would be a good idea to use a period tracking app to track my cycles and ovulation (I was not on bc when I lost my virginity) . In that app is a sex/intimacy option that I use when I start dating a new partner. Nothing special, just with or without condom, masturbation, oral, orgasam, etc. It also has options to add symptoms and moods. \n\nAnyway, my partner and I were talking and the topic of how many times we've hung out without sex came up. I said I could check my app to see. He immediately became uncomfortable and ended our phone conversation. A few minutes later I received this text: \n\"I feel violated.  Keeping track of sex is so fucked and to not tell me is even more fucked.  I want to take some time off.\" \n\nI told him that I will respect his boundaries, and then explained the purpose of the app is track my menstrual cycle, had nothing to do with tracking my partners. I also voiced that I understand his uncomfortableness and will give him space. Now my question is am I the asshole for not disclosing about my period tracker?!", "created_utc": 1701073019, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184y32v/aita_for_not_telling_my_partner_about_my_period/", "score": 932, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is he dense? Does he know that it\u2019s not an app to track sex specifically?", "NTA. I use a similar app called \"Flo\". The main purpose of the app is to track the dates on which your period will start and when ovulation begins. It's a very private app and has absolutely nothing to do with your partner, you don't have to disclose it at all. The app has extra features which allows you to track when you had intercourse but that is not the main purpose of the app. Him asking for space because of it is absolutely bs and immature behavior.", "The notion that a person isn't allowed to track whatever the fuck they want about themselves seems very odd to me!

Best case he\u2019s very immature, but realistically this is a red flag.", "NTA at all, but I do want to note that apps like Flo are NOT SAFE in states where abortion is inaccessible.

What would he do if you were to write a diary about your life and experiences? Would he accuse you of writing a novel about him?", "NTA.

The app has nothing to do with him and isn't something he needs to know about but also not something you were trying to hide. You mentioned it when it was relevant.

Up to you and completely personal if you want to track sexual activity. I think you could be an asshole if you were sharing the results on facebook or something, as that might violate his privacy. \n\nMy guess is, knowing men, is that he's probably insecure about your previous partners, rather than anything to do with tracking sex with HIM. I'm willing to put money on it that if there were no other partners on that app other than him he'd not mind one bit and maybe even be a little proud.", "NTA. It would be irresponsible not to track your cycle and when you're having unprotected sex. Even protected sex.. this guy needs to grow tf up.", "NTA. Give him ALL THE SPACE HE WANTS.

It is a VERY useful app, and all of that information is helpful to track a LOT about your body.. Both with possible pregnancy, but also if you end up with any health issues like UTI, etc. Personal I use it almost as \"diary\" of sorts. The more information I enter allows me to track how I am feeling both emotionally and physically and consider what might have influenced those feelings. The entire app is completely customizable for a personal experience to gain more insight into your own body and really is no one else's business. You didn't need to tell your BF about it at all if you didn't want to. My guess is that as a guy, he isn't used to tracking anything about his body, and this whole concept is strange. But not being willing to ask questions or try to understand before hanging up and asking for space is a big red flag, IMO. Personally, my BF is completely aware of the app and all that I track. He jokes about trying to see how many 'hearts' we can get in the app and is bothered it doesn't have the option to get multiple on one day if we had sex more than once.

We have talked and know that we are not exclusive or ready for titles, but we have discussed that we are sexually exclusive.\n\nWhen I first became sexually active I thought it would be a good idea to use a period tracking app to track my cycles and ovulation (I was not on bc when I lost my virginity) . In that app is a sex/intimacy option that I use when I start dating a new partner. Nothing special, just with or without condom, masturbation, oral, orgasam, etc. It also has options to add symptoms and moods. \n\nAnyway, my partner and I were talking and the topic of how many times we've hung out without sex came up. I said I could check my app to see. He immediately became uncomfortable and ended our phone conversation. A few minutes later I received this text: \n\"I feel violated.  Keeping track of sex is so fucked and to not tell me is even more fucked.  I want to take some time off.\" \n\nI told him that I will respect his boundaries, and then explained the purpose of the app is track my menstrual cycle, had nothing to do with tracking my partners. I also voiced that I understand his uncomfortableness and will give him space. Now my question is am I the asshole for not disclosing about my period tracker?!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
