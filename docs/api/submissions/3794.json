She claimed she did it for us (me and my sibs). After her second marriage failed really quickly (she married the guy she cheated on my dad with) she gave my dad custody of us. \n\nWhen he found out she was taking us to stranger men\u2019s houses on her weekends he told her to stop that immediately and could only take us to a boyfriend\u2019s house if they had been together longer term (like at least 6 months or more). Instead of doing that she\u2019d marry them really quickly and when my dad protested she could say \u201cwell he\u2019s my husband, clearly it\u2019s a serious relationship\u201d. She\u2019s been engaged probably 10 times too but those guys got smart before the wedding actually took place, but it still did the job.\n\nHer health (and looks) started going downhill 9 years ago, so she found a rich old dude to marry and she\u2019s been with him since. I think she thought he would die before her (like I think she thought she\u2019d be a widow by now) but this guy is in *excellent* health and the irony is hilarious. She will probably pass before he does honestly. So there\u2019s a fun story for you lol", "Right?? I was friends with a set of twins in high school, they had four other siblings and one on the way.
