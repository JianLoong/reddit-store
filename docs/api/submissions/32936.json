She somehow seemed to always forget mine though. Except maybe once when she got me socks. (not herself, she asked my fiance and I guess with what little money he got from her, he bought socks)\n\nShe's the biggest crybaby I've ever met. To the point where my boyfriend literally has trauma and cannot see women crying. (including me, which caused many fights) \n\nShe once cried for hours because he didn't have dinner with her on the weekend like they've used to do for years. \n\nShe makes snide remarks that would go over my fianc\u00e9's head. Like the time when my parents bought a house on the beach and were rebuilding some parts of it. My fiance on his own mentioned how expensive some of the furniture my parents got, and all she had to say was \"oh that's not much, why aren't they paying more? I didn't think they'd be so cheap\" \n\nThis women literally lived in her grandmother's hand me down furniture to the point where if you sat on one of her couches you'd sink because it's been used for decades. \n\nThere are many incidents.

I find him doing small gestures of kindness. Like peeling a clementine for me, calling me occasionally to check on me, he's given me a few lifts when my car has broke down and he's just in general a nice person. \n\nBut I always find my fianc\u00e9 mentioning how after marriage he'd want his mother to come over more, how she'd get sick if he left her for too long, about how we should have a big wedding instead of having a small one because his mother WOULD LOVE to invite all her \"besties\" to the wedding to show off her only dentist son! \n\nI realize that he's her only son and the reason she tries to stay glued to him like sleeping in his room and asking him to hand feed her is because she probably feels lonely as she doesn't have a good relationship with her husband. \n\nI don't like the fact that I don't like her but she's also not giving me any reason to like her. I like my fiance but I don't like his family. \n\nI still visit them weekly but if I can play sick to get out of it then I occasionally do. \n\n\n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate1: I feel humiliated for not having realized the truth sooner. He canceled our lunch reservation because his mother \"needed\" him. He forgot to call me to inform me too so I had to call him and ask only for him to reply that he's with \"family\". I tried my hardest not to cry because I knew his history, I explained in the calmest way possible that I'm his family too now, not just a woman he's bedding. It took a lot from me to not cry and be rational while having the talk with him on the phone. We're taking a break now.\n\nUpdate2: We talked again. We officially ended it.
