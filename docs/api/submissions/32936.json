I'm rethinking this relationship though and I'm thankful for everyone who responded.", "Why did the narcissist cross the road?  \nHe thought it was a boundary.", "But why is she specifally doing this to my fiance? Why not her husband or her two daughters? I don't find her crying if her daughters decide to skip dinner or if they don't call.", "Formalities are important though.  If I had a son who was marrying someone I'd make sure not to cause unnecessary problems by behaving badly.  And not giving gifts to someone who gives gifts to you is behaving badly.  You seem to have seen the light but for future relationships, not bothering to do the little stuff is significant.  It's showing how much effort they will put into appearing to care.  If you can't get that, you've got nothing.", "It\u2019s her only son. And sometimes people select their \u201cgolden child\u201d at random. \n\nHonestly it sounds like she has been abusing him, and he could benefit from therapy.\n\n\nHand feeding her, the manipulation via crying (which is so severe he has lasting reactions), and lack of boundaries is not normal. \n\n\nLike everyone else said, this isn\u2019t going to get better or go away until he gets therapy and can address these issues and set (and HOLD) boundaries with mom.", "He's going to need to get distance, physical and emotional, from her and she's going to fight against that. She's already emotionally dependent on him as it is and he's got a life time of conditioning to realise and undo."]}
