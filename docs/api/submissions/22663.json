I hope it doesn\u2019t come back to bite you on the arse. I can\u2019t get over the kids playing with piles of cash in a room. What\u2019s going on there?", "NTA - but it's start with calling the police. They're likely to respond faster than CPS and will get CPS to come.", "NTA by a mile. That\u2019s BS, they need to take responsibility. The only concern needs to be the kids safety, period. They can be as angry as they want with you, parents like that I wouldn\u2019t want to like me.", "NTA Their toddler is wandering around and nobody is aware.  It's happened multiple times and you've tried to talk to the mom. Sounds like they need a reality check about what's really going on.  It's also not your job to try and correct your neighbor up avoid \"drama \"", "NTA \n\none time is one thing because kids are silly but three times in a week is way excessive - they're not looking after their child. Thank god he wanders over to your house and not some predator's", "NTA\n\nIn the end, regardless of any of the other extraneous details, there is a child that is clearly in danger. \n\nA 3 year old being unsupervised outside a house can easily come to harm, and you need to act to try to resolve that.", "You did the right thing.\n\nThe mother was a child abuse victim, and is clearly not capable or motivated to parent.", "NTA at all. Thank you for calling them.", "NTA\n\nIf CPS contacted them or came out the same day, CPS took this report very seriously. Do not call up CPS and withdraw your wife's report (not that I suspect they'll take that). Hopefully this is the end of the wandering 3yo but if it's not, you're going to have to consider what to do next. It does sound like he tried to threaten you, and if there is a next time, you may have to explicitly tell CPS you need the report to be anonymous due to a threat.", "Wow NTA at all. This is the sort of situation CPS is meant to help with. I am sure it will be inconvenient for your neighbors but they are endangering their children. That poor kid needs help.", "NTA. In my experience CPS causes more problems than they solve, but you tried other avenues before calling them. The kid could have wandered into traffic, or been grabbed by someone, or wandered into a river, or hundred of other much worse scenarios.", "NTA. Mom is irresponsible, her fault, not your wife.", "NTA\n\nWhat if the 3yo had wandered ANYWHERE ELSE? Any of those three times? Further away, into traffic, into the arms or home of someone with not-so-good intentions?\n\nAnd keep in mind these are only the three times you know about.\n\nThey\u2019re lucky that the only consequence they\u2019re facing is a call or visit from CPS.\n\nIf it happens again, call the police.\n\n(My heart aches for the childhood mom in this post. But still an AH for endangering the child.)", "So fake.", "You did the right thing. CPS  will do the leg work you can't do, and determine if the children are fit to live in the home. You did the right thing by calling the professionals. It isn't your job to watch their kids and make sure they're being responsible. NTA", "NTA.", "NTA a 3 year old wandering thrice alone, that's a good reason to call.", "A 3 year old wondering around by himself?! Thrice in a week?\n\nNTA", "You know... I wish I knew. I had to cut out some of those details to fit in the character limit. But my wife was shocked at that scene. It was money just spread out over the bed (everyone's fantasy to just jump on a pile of money). That's a 7 yo and 12 yo playing with cash. I've asked my wife a dozen times since if she's positive it wasn't monopoly money!", "The report WAS technically anonymous. But the dad put 2 and 2 together immediately... since the entire incident involved only us. So I really don't know how we can navigate this in the future in a way where we can genuinely be anonymous.\n\nThat dialogue was the weirdest. He was very matter of fact, direct, never raised his voice (I got a little more animated than I would have liked, just feeling like he wasn't taking seriously the situation because we just wanted \"drama\"). So it didn't have a threatening vibe - it just felt like nothing.", "Hmmm, maybe they don\u2019t trust banks. Maybe it\u2019s the spoils of crime (that\u2019s where my mind first went). Do you have cameras around the outside of your home?", "Yeah, I immediately jumped to some shady, under the table stuff.\n\nWe have a camera in the front to see who comes to the door and a camera in the back where the kids play... not on the sides adjacent to the neighbors or anything like that.", "> he explained good neighbors don't just call CPS\n\nGood neighbors don't let 3 year old children get obviously neglected", "I would call CPS again tonsay that the absent father trying to gaslight you or something but i am just petty. NTA.", "NTA - I'm a mandated reporter and I absolutely would have reported this.  I mean it wouldn't even be one of those times where I question if I'm over reacting.", "You are amazing! I\u2019m so glad you called CPS.", "NTA. A 3 year old child wandering around in the street once is enough to send alarm bells ringing. But 3 times in a week, the third time half naked having wet themself without a parent in sight is blatant neglect. It doesn\u2019t matter how many times you spoke to the neighbours directly, that child is in danger.", "NTA, but frankly, you waited too long to call CPS. I doubt with how the mother was acting, that this situation is going to be solved anytime soon.", "NTA. This child is being neglected. You did the right thing,", "NTA But dad thinks this is sorted now and that cps won't visit and that you will continue to bring the child back with no further reports. You absolutely did the right thing but this is by no means over.", "As a rule, the state has access to interpreters - so if nothing else, they can hold discussions with the parents and detail what expectations are for children in your locale.\n\nNTA", "From the title, I wasn't sure--I've heard stories from otherwise decent parents where their escape-artist toddler figures out the locks and latches during naptime and goes on walkabout.  That happened to my cousin when her son was three.\n\nFrom the details, NTA at all.  There's a tragedy waiting to happen in that household.  Hopefully, CPS will be able to connect them with resources, training, and motivation to change how they handle things.", "NTA", "You did the right thing. If this kept going on, either one of your kids or one of their kids could have been severely injured or dead soon. Nobody would want that. Also, a genuinely good parent shouldn't have to worry about CPS coming because they wouldn't have anything to fear.", "NTA you did the right thing. Please don\u2019t back down those kids are at risk", "NTA And if it keeps happening, call them again. And again.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong here. You did exactly what needed to be done.", "NTA. The little one came to you for help and calling COS was how you helped him. I feel like there should have been more you could do in the moment, but I honestly don't know what. Calling CPS was appropriate and they are NOT good parents. I fear for that kid's life. Keep your footage of all the times the baby comes to you for help. It may be needed for court.", "I called CPS on a family in my neighborhood, they got help and the resources they needed.\n\n\nEveryone is doing much better now.\n\n\nNot all cps callss end up with the kids taken away.", "I\u2019m guessing they middle eastern due to my own countries problem with this. NTA, expect it to get worse with the boys, girls is over parented and boys aren\u2019t at all from experience here. Plus, he\u2019s 3, he shouldn\u2019t be walking alone around, especially if he\u2019s naked. What if someone taken him?", "NTA, but never admit you called CPS.  Piles of cash imply they may have some business that might come under scrutiny.  Never inform someone that you contacted authorities unless your life is in danger as it may result in your life being put in danger.", "NTA next time call the cops.", "How did the 3 year old ring the doorbell?", "NTA. Yes, it can happen fast but from what you describe nobody was even trying to watch the kid, who could have wandered into traffic several times...\nThis is just dangerous neglect and being from a different culture has nothing to do with being neglective parents.", "Did you even have a choice? Aren't you a mandatory reporter as a foster parent, even if you aren't active?   It was necessary and is probably going to continue, so good for you to have started the record.  On the money, though, having lots of cash is a cultural thing for several cultures.  Banking is avoided as much as possible and paychecks cashed or withdrawn as soon as possible.  That part wouldn't worry me so much.", "NTA, there is more than just the kid's issue.  The mother was a child bride.  She is not learning English so she cannot make friend in the community or reach out if she need help.  She is a SAHM, doubt she has access to money/job (enough to live on her own). It almost sounds like she has just given up.  CPS needs to also reach out to her and see if she really wants to be married to this man.", "NTA. This wasn't just a one off thing. That was three times the kid could have wandered into traffic rather than to your front door. Don't get me wrong, I've taken my eye off my kid for a second and they're into mischief, but this kid has been left alone long enough to make a mess with the turmeric, then also walk to you and mum still hasn't noticed when you're banging on the door. This is a family that needs help. I suspect mum is depressed/overwhelmed by her situation, this will hopefully get her the help she clearly needs", "Right? What if the neighbor he wandered to was nefarious?", "Or she's deeply depressed about moving to a country where she can't understand the language and is totally isolated. Either way, I feel bad for her but someone in a position of authority should speak to her about mental health and parenting resources.", "This OP is referring to the fact that she had a child at 14.", "They need to get her away from this man.  Child bride, moves to a new country, cannot speak the language, husband moves her to a community where no one speaks her language to isolate her and keep her from leaving.  She is a total victim her.", "Somehow the fact that this guy wasn't even upset is even more disturbing. Surely an actual normal human being with feelings would show more emotions than that?? Very bizarre, even if you don't feel threatened do be careful.", "It's nothing until he sucker punches you. I'm sorry but calm and matter of fact about AWFUL facts is bullshit to me. It reads as disrespect", "That\u2019s the thing though. The innocent can sometimes give off the wrong vibe as we aren\u2019t sure how to feel and we are angry. The guilty can seem the most innocent because they know and have thought about/practiced what they would say or do when confronted with the situations.  Hence he was calm, to the point and acknowledged and brushed off the issue all at the same time.  Which is now leaving you wondering if you are the issue.  \nDon\u2019t cancel the call. Like others have said at this point if they are investigating already chances are it won\u2019t make a difference. Or it could make it worse as if there is something happening why is your complaint now being pulled.", "Doubt the marriage was her choice.", "It may be that they are undocumented so are working for cash and don't have a bank account.", "I'm not sure what their deal is but if they are involved in anything shady the last thing they want is any kind of authority involved. Proceed with caution.", "This is pretty anecdotal, but from my experience, a lot of immigrants start by hoarding all their cash and don't necessarily have bank accounts or may not trust banks because of the way things were in the country they're from. When my parents moved to Canada from China, they kept all the cash at home in a safe and never put it into a bank account. Even after getting a bank account, for a long time, they kept the money in one of those safety boxes in the bank rather than the actual account. Not really sure why but they had a hard time trusting banks completely with their money. It was the same with a lot of their friends and also with parents of my friends who were immigrants as well. Obviously not for everyone, but its was relatively common.", "Yeah my first instinct here is that they dint want CPS involved because they have something to hide. Whether that something is being undocumented, human traffiking, a meth lab under their living room, or just the way they treat their children, the level of response he had to you does indicate something he doesn't want CPS seeing.", "Did your bank check your citizenship status when you opened an account? Because mine sure didn\u2019t.", "Unlikely that they don't have a bank account - they likely wouldn't have a place without one, since most places insist on having receipts for payments through a bank.\n\nBut the undocumented part is more viable.  What I suspect is that there's something going on there that is *very* illegal (undocumented, human trafficking, anything that would garner unwanted attention from CPS reports), and that's why the dad is so insistent on OP taking back the report.", "It's more that undocumented workers are afraid (often with hood cause) to use institutions. And your bank almost certainly required you to provide your SSN (or permanent resident tax ID #) and a valid government issued ID (which would not be available in many states)."]}
