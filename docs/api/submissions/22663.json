The mom is 26 yo, marrying and having kids at 14 in their home country. She\u00a0speaks no english. Everything is translated by their 12yo.

I hope it doesn\u2019t come back to bite you on the arse. I can\u2019t get over the kids playing with piles of cash in a room. What\u2019s going on there?", "NTA - but it's start with calling the police. They're likely to respond faster than CPS and will get CPS to come.", "NTA by a mile. That\u2019s BS, they need to take responsibility. The only concern needs to be the kids safety, period. They can be as angry as they want with you, parents like that I wouldn\u2019t want to like me.", "NTA Their toddler is wandering around and nobody is aware.  It's happened multiple times and you've tried to talk to the mom. Sounds like they need a reality check about what's really going on.  It's also not your job to try and correct your neighbor up avoid \"drama \"", "NTA \n\none time is one thing because kids are silly but three times in a week is way excessive - they're not looking after their child. Thank god he wanders over to your house and not some predator's", "NTA\n\nIn the end, regardless of any of the other extraneous details, there is a child that is clearly in danger. \n\nA 3 year old being unsupervised outside a house can easily come to harm, and you need to act to try to resolve that.", "You did the right thing.\n\nThe mother was a child abuse victim, and is clearly not capable or motivated to parent.", "NTA at all. Thank you for calling them.", "NTA\n\nIf CPS contacted them or came out the same day, CPS took this report very seriously. Do not call up CPS and withdraw your wife's report (not that I suspect they'll take that). Hopefully this is the end of the wandering 3yo but if it's not, you're going to have to consider what to do next. It does sound like he tried to threaten you, and if there is a next time, you may have to explicitly tell CPS you need the report to be anonymous due to a threat.", "Wow NTA at all. This is the sort of situation CPS is meant to help with. I am sure it will be inconvenient for your neighbors but they are endangering their children. That poor kid needs help.", "NTA. In my experience CPS causes more problems than they solve, but you tried other avenues before calling them. The kid could have wandered into traffic, or been grabbed by someone, or wandered into a river, or hundred of other much worse scenarios.", "NTA. Mom is irresponsible, her fault, not your wife.", "NTA\n\nWhat if the 3yo had wandered ANYWHERE ELSE? Further away, into traffic, into the arms or home of someone with not-so-good intentions?\n\nThey\u2019re lucky that the only consequence they\u2019re facing is a call or visit from CPS.\n\nIf it happens again, call the police.", "So fake.", "You did the right thing. CPS  will do the leg work you can't do, and determine if the children are fit to live in the home. You did the right thing by calling the professionals. It isn't your job to watch their kids and make sure they're being responsible.

I had to cut out some of those details to fit in the character limit. But my wife was shocked at that scene. It was money just spread out over the bed (everyone's fantasy to just jump on a pile of money). That's a 7 yo and 12 yo playing with cash. I've asked my wife a dozen times since if she's positive it wasn't monopoly money!", "The report WAS technically anonymous. But the dad put 2 and 2 together immediately... since the entire incident involved only us. So I really don't know how we can navigate this in the future in a way where we can genuinely be anonymous.\n\nThat dialogue was the weirdest. He was very matter of fact, direct, never raised his voice (I got a little more animated than I would have liked, just feeling like he wasn't taking seriously the situation because we just wanted \"drama\"). So it didn't have a threatening vibe - it just felt like nothing.", "Hmmm, maybe they don\u2019t trust banks. Maybe it\u2019s the spoils of crime (that\u2019s where my mind first went). Do you have cameras around the outside of your home?", "Yeah, I immediately jumped to some shady, under the table stuff.\n\nWe have a camera in the front to see who comes to the door and a camera in the back where the kids play... not on the sides adjacent to the neighbors or anything like that."]}
