You are never an AH for having feelings about a situation, it is more about how you respond. From this post, it doesnt seem you have done anything that would put you in AH territory. \n\nMy advice would be to make it so you dont see your sister's social media posts. If she brings it up to or around you, smile blandly and redirect the conversation. Clearly, sister is having some issues with the attention you are probably getting from being ill. Instead of being happy for her health, she would rather milk this opportunity for likes and reposts. This is nothing to do with you and with your illness, the best thing you can do is ignore her pettiness and focus on yourself. \n\nSurround yourself with positivity and block all those who would make you stressed. Consider how healthy it is to have your sister in your life and adjust contact accordingly. Perhaps you only see her at family gatherings? Dont let her get into your head. At the end of the day, she can tell people what she likes and you dont need to react to it at all.", "I don't think it was just that spot for your sister, your sister IS cancer \n\nNTA", "NTA. I'm an assistant for a skin cancer surgeon and we remove basal cells all day long, nose being one of the most common places. Basal cell is not a lethal cancer as it does not spread elsewhere. It can become serious if it's untreated for many years and causes severe tissue damage, but even then, it's not fatal. I definitely would not consider someone why has had a tiny basal cell removed a \"cancer survivor\".", "NTA. Your sister is a headcase", "NTA.  It sounds like your sister is really, really insecure and desperate for attention, and also pretty self-centered.  And yes, she was probably scared to find the spot and happy to have it removed, but context is everything.  It sounds like she implied that this was far more serious and imminently life-threatening than it was.  I suspect that if she had posted about it with context, you wouldn't have been so annoyed (but she wouldn't have gotten to be so dramatic).  Your sister probably does need some attention and TLC, but not from you.", "NTA", "Bloody hell your sister sounds like a loon. NTA, I would be annoyed too, and not just by her exploiting this for social media.", "NTA but also it isn't a cancer contest. Yours is severe but she is allowed to pay that she's relieved that hers has been removed.", "NTA. I once had a mole being removed by the local clinic. Two stitches, and back to the office. I wouldn't really consider myself a skin cancer survivor or sth like that", "NTA - i have some REALLY serious autoimmune diseases and have to take the same meds cancer patients take, just lower doses. I have had 2 mild cancers requiring surgery only. I tell ppl i am on chemo but i am VERY quick to make sure they understand its not for cancer. I dont even like mentioning previous cancers because they were so mild and ppl get the wrong idea.\n\nYour sis might not be TA either tho. She might have really been scared, and really relieved its gone. Of course it appears she is exaggerating for sympathy, but no one but her can really know that. As long as she isnt lying or starting a go-fund-me i would really try to let it go. She has no idea what its like to be as sick as you and no one can until they are.", "NTA, but my grandpa died of skin cancer and it can be real cancer. She might have had some actual fear involved that it could be worse than it turned out to be. What you're going through totally sucks, and being annoyed and offended is fair, but you should just let this go and skip the drama and pay a lot less energy towards that sister and what she says and does. Like make her the relation you bump in to at family events and otherwise don't really know what's up in their life. She doesn't sound worth the effort. You'll be happier letting her go, and you don't need that stress. I really do hope you find a donor match and get to post something that she did someday.", "It really IS that simple.  Sister is jealous of your disease and all the attention you are getting.  Simply stated.  Let me give an example.  My adult child has a chronic disease that requires a LOT of attention, think mid 30's/BOTH of my adult kids.  My other child stated that she wished she had gotten that disease so we would pay more attention to HER.....????????????????  I asked my DD if she thought that HAVING that disease made her brother feel like he WON by NEEDING that attention???  Crickets/", "NTA - When she talks to people about her 'battle with cancer,' you should have people ask her how her chemo treatments went.", "ESH, but not a 50/50 split. It sounds like she hasn't been great to you, and you have certainly suffered. But she did have a cancer diagnosis, and probably especially after watching what you've endured, is feeling incredibly relieved to have a clean bill of health. Is she being dramatic? Yes. Is your situation way worse and a way huger deal? Yes. Are you being gatekeepy, though? Also yes. I can't fault you for feeling how you feel, but it's a you thing and not a her thing.", "NTA\n\nImagine doing \"stolen valor\" for cancer... Pathetic", "NTA sounds like she just wants attention. Yeah it must have been scary for her but this is very insensitive especially considering what you\u2019ve been through", "yta\n\nBasal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer and the most frequently occurring form of all cancers. In the U.S. alone, an estimated 3.6 million cases are diagnosed each year. BCCs arise from abnormal, uncontrolled growth of basal cells.\r  \n\r  \nBecause BCCs grow slowly, most are curable and cause minimal damage when caught and treated early. Understanding BCC causes, risk factors and warning signs can help you detect them early, when they are easiest to treat and cure.\n\nyes she had cancer\n\ncancer is cancer no matter what type", "NTA - I\u2019m speechless. Your sister sounds like a monster", "YTA. Cancer is cancer and it\u2019s scary as fuck regardless of how invasive it is, how far or how little it\u2019s progressed. It\u2019s something that will always lurk even if you caught it early enough to get it easily removed, because you always know it\u2019s probably coming back.", "Wow. Gatekeeping cancer. That's a new one. YTA.", "ESH. She should have been more sensitive knowing what you\u2019re going through, but she does still have the right to be afraid for herself and express that.

To put it into perspective, someone who presents to hospital with a BCC that was removed is not even thought to have a \u2018history of cancer\u2019, whereas the cancer OP is taking about us very serious and would. BCC is not life threatening, doesn\u2019t require any serious treatment (chemo, radiation etc), doesn\u2019t impact a person\u2019s lifespan. It\u2019s not the same *at all*.
