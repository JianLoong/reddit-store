He's now getting gifts he likes, so it's not like he's missing out.\n\nNTA You should tell him how much other people appreciate your homemade gifts. And then compare his underwhelming reactions.

You two need to talk so you can let him know that you were hurt when he just disposed of the things you spent time making for him.

Consequently, seeing what you made being put aside can feel pretty dismissive, even if that wasn't the intent. He should understand how you could feel that way and not generalize to a broader conclusion.", "I mean... yeah you could've communicated earlier but damn...this is funny.\n\n\n\nNTA\n\n\nHe plays the victim pretty well", "NTA\n\nHowever...it does sound likenhe liked your gifts.\n\nAnd taking a big hint...give him food gifts lol Or practical home made gifts...that have a long term use.\n\nI am similar in some ways...highly practical so I struge with what to do with home made gifts. I am guilty of having got them, loved them, stuck them in a drawer and then thrown them years later. I absolutely appreciated them...but didn't know what to do with them long term.", "NAH. With handmade gifts it's always better to ask the person in advance what they'd like, especially if you're going to invest a large amount of time in it. Your husband might like receiving something you make because it gives him a part in your hobby (his actions also seem to indicate this: refilling your supplies, helping to organize your basket etc.). Just talk to him calmly and from a place of love, let him know that he is worthy of your time and get a list of things that he would like you to make for him, so that your future gifts don't end up unused.", "NAH\n\nI can't call either of you AHs. He ia obviously super supportive and you want your work valued. But for your own sake, communicate! Why not ask him which crafts he likes or whether he wants trinkets? He may be confused about what to do with an origami animal (which seems plausible if he helps you tidy up. Maybe he doesn't like clutter), but a chocolate is totally different and has more purpose. Why not spend your time making stuff that he would like? Similar to how gift giving is centred around what the recipient likes and not what the gifter wants to gift. He's hurt though because it doesn't sound great to be told that you're not worth effort and maybe he feels bad. But without having a conversation, you gave him no chance to rectify it.\n\nI'm saying this as a fellow crafter. My Mum loves my random crocheted animals but god knows my husband would have no clue what to do with them. So I don't make them for him. But if he wanted a knitted hat, I'd make that.", "NAH. This is a simple communication issue. Your husband definitely twisted your words, whether deliberately or because of his own insecurities or plain old misunderstanding.  This part needs to be discussed, with you being crystal clear about what you meant.  I would also let him know that if it was deliberate, that you will not respond to guilt trips or manipulations because that's not acceptable.  I've personally had a similar reaction to my partner saying something was a waste of time, and felt like he was saying I was a waste of time/taking the time for whatever it was *with me specifically* was a waste of time, which still made me feel like he was saying I was the waste of time. Idk if that made sense at all, but basically I've had what was essentially a trauma response that was similar to the situation with your husband.\n\n>he knows I enjoy it and he encourages me to do it. He\u2019ll pay for me to go to classes I\u2019ve talked about, or my origami paper supply will magically refill itself and the basket with my knitting supplies is always tidy even if I know I didn\u2019t put it back so carefully.\n\nThis is actually kind of adorable, and from an outside view seems supportive and caring, which also makes me lean towards him twisting your words not being a deliberate manipulation attempt.  \n\nAnother POV that may or may not be helpful: I personally have a super hard time with knick knacks and little cluttery things, they just sit around getting dusty and it makes me anxious. So stuff my kids make at school? They end up buried in a drawer even though I love that they made me something. I just.... Don't know what to do with it, and eventually about 75% of the things end up in the trash a couple years later.  It's definitely not a lack of appreciation though, and it doesn't mean I want them to stop making me cute little doodads - even ones that are \"useless\" (aka just for fun or decoration, no actual purpose).  But I will say that things that have a tangible use are even more meaningful for me, because it shows that they've been paying attention to see what I need/want/will actually have a use for.  I hope that helps!!", "Nah.  Just a misunderstanding", "YTA \nYou said you stopped gifting him stuff but never told him why until he asked.

The husband sounds like a pretty considerate guy, so I wouldn't jump to the assumption that he purposefully twisted OP's words right away. Having a proper talk about it might be really helpful. OP could explain that it just seemed better to get him gifts that he would actually appreciate instead of something he'll stuff away, and the husband could maybe talk about if the sudden change made it seem like he mattered less than other people or something.

He absolutely twisted your words but it is possible he liked that you were thinking of him and spending effort on him even if he didn't actually like the gift or know what to do with them. It's probably not malicious if he's refilling your paper and helping you keep your yarn straightened up. I hate how disrespectful people are to craft people but that might be the way you need to approach a future conversation. I'm saying NAH unless him twisting your words was malicious and he does it often. \n\nOr he is jealous that everyone else got chocolates.

OP, it sounds like your husband recognizes the emotional value of your gifts but isn't the kind of person who sentimentaluzes the objects themselves.

I think he's capable of recognizing that he's twisting your words here in order to make you feel bad, perhaps because he is avoiding expressing why *he* feels bad: \n\n>He got all quiet and said he didn\u2019t realise he was a waste of my time. \n\nIt may be that he enjoys the act of getting the gifts, and he doesn't realize how hurtful just socking them away in the closet is. Of course you see it differently - attention and appreciation of the thing you're giving is important to you, and he's not following through. It's reasonable for you to disagree in perspective on that, but he's being an AH in attacking you and then withdrawing rather than trying to resolve the conflict.", "NTA It's not that hard to understand that folks that hand make things want those things to be appreciated and used. It would be one thing if he worked them away because they were precious to him because you made them for him. That's not what's happening, though. He's not a waste of time and you never said he was.

I don\u2019t do that when the recipient isn\u2019t someone who\u2019s into that sort of thing. It\u2019d be a waste of time and supplies. Better to give them something they actually enjoy that won\u2019t end up getting tossed.", "NTA - OP your yarn husband, should know he isn't knit worthy, and understand what that means. \n\nA hand-knitted item is a big investment, and I'm not talking about just the yarn.  Knitting something for someone else represents an enormous amount of time and energy.", "NTA, he's absolutely twisting your words. I knit a lot, and I'm currently in the middle of making my husband a cardigan. This is his third, because he wears the other ones I made him. If he'd never worn the first one, he wouldn't have gotten the other two. Why would you spend all of your time making a gift that someone doesn't actually want? That's just silly. It's way better to gift him things he'll actually enjoy.\n\nIgnore anyone calling you an asshole.

OP, from what you've said it sounds like part of his love language is doing things for you. The actual doing, not even pointing it out and getting praised or thanked. So maybe he doesn't really like handmade stuff but it's really special to him that you do stuff for him. That that's the bit he cares about.\n\nYou both sound lovely and loving and hurt. Try not to think about it as \"him twisting your words\" but \"him hearing your words from a place of pain\" and see if you can really gently reopen the conversation, starting with validating his emotions (not his interpretation). You can say \"I'm so sorry I made you feel like it's not worth doing things for you\" and let him express his feelings, and validate them, before moving onto that you DO love doing things for him, you just want to do the things that HE appreciates rather than just what's fun for you.

The sentence \"didn't realise he was a waste of time\" is problematic, as she did not say any of the sort. But as this was a impulsive reaction it does not qualify as AH. Is a week has passed, you need to talk about it soon in a quit moment.\n\nHowever what some commentators overlook is, that he does support her hobby. Paying for stuff, refilling etc. \n\nThe question is, what is more important?\n\nHim supporting her hobby?\n\nHim acknowledging the product?", "When I was 10, I was just learning to sew and managed to get some leftover fabric and made a set of gonggi (Korean jacks) with rice. I gave it to my dad. He didn't play or have any idea what to do with it \ud83d\ude02 but still thanked me for them.\n\nI found them years later tucked in his sock drawer. I personally took this to mean he knew I put effort into it and didn't want to throw it out, but it was also a useless gift (at least I knew when I found them) for him which was why it was hidden away in his drawer. This to me, was a sign to step up my gift giving and put more thought into what I was making or buying. My dad never said a word.\n\nThese days, I get comments from friends and coworkers about the thought put into each gift. And that makes me feel good.\n\nNAH. OP is understandably upset to not see her gifts in use, but that just means they are not quite the appropriate gifts for that person. Clearly, he would appreciate the chocolates and not a baby blanket but also doesn't know how to say so. But this is just a failure to communicate.", "NAH\n\nIt hurts when something you put time, effort, and love into seems to go unappreciated. If you see the things you create for him going put away or thrown out, of course you are going to assume he doesn't appreciate them and stop wasting time on them.\n\nHowever, maybe what he appreciated about your gifts wasn't the material gift itself, but rather the symbolic representation of your time and effort for him. The item itself wasn't used, but maybe he loved just knowing you were thinking of him while you made it? \n\nGood gift giving is thinking about what the recipient actually wants. You didn't think he wanted those type of gifts based on your observations, so you stopped making them. That makes sense. He could have communicated better how much he did appreciate those gifts. Maybe he assumed his support of your crafting was enough to let you know? \n\nEither way, neither of you are AHs here.", "I don't think anyone here is TA. \n\nI'm going to use an example I had from work. I drink a lot of tea/coffee throughout the day, and used to always offer to make my colleague a cup when I got one for myself. She always declined after her lunch break (and had previously told me she doesn't like to drink tea/coffee for at least half an hour after she eats)... so I stopped offering during these times. A week later, I made myself a cup of tea at lunch time and hadn't offered her any and she was really upset (that was the one day she would have liked one). What she was upset about was not that I hadn't made her tea, but that I hadn't bothered asking. Me asking her if she would like tea/coffee showed consideration for her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI may be unpopular in my opinion here, but your husband supports your hobbies a lot more than a lot of spouses might. He shows through his actions that he supports you and encourages you to continue (as you said, tidying up after you or replenishing supplies). Men are generally creatures of actions rather than words. To you, buying him a shop bought gift more in line with his tastes was considerate. To him, you put time and effort into making everyone else's gifts, except his. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one is TA, but you both need to communicate better. Maybe you could find a middle ground and make him a home made card for these occasions, or homemade chocolate for easter etc. Something practical that he can use or consume rather than has to keep forever.", "These are the words of a man looking for a reason to be upset. \n\nIt's not about the gifts.

I can see why you are upset and that\u2019s why I say NAH but you are teensy bit TA for being so passive aggressive. You should just talk about why he doesn\u2019t use the ones he doesn\u2019t use and see what he would use and about how you\u2019d prefer they be treated.", "As a couple you are both AHs for inability to effing Communicate!\n\nDear gods and minor deities, did y'all never consider talking?", "NAH you\u2019ve got a breakdown in communication here. He obviously supports your artistic crafts, most partners wouldn\u2019t think to clean up your hobby related things or go and buy your supplies when you\u2019re not around. He\u2019s paying a lot of attention in his own way. And in return he received gifts that showed you were thinking about him too. He may not display them, some people just don\u2019t like displaying trinkets. I don\u2019t. I appreciate them but trinkets out in the open are clutter to me, so I store them. Or maybe the gift receiving is more important than the actual gift to him. I\u2019m also that way. Receiving a gift is a sign of care and thought and love from another person, the object itself isn\u2019t of much importance but the act is huge. The object itself loses some meaning after time has passed for me but that doesn\u2019t mean I want the giver to stop or that I don\u2019t like the gifts. The statement everyone is shitting on as him twisting your words was probably a heat of the moment kind of thing said because he was really hurt that you had purposefully stopped making him things when that was very special to him. If he didn\u2019t like your gifts or like receiving them, as like I said that may be the act of love he feels, he wouldn\u2019t have ever noticed they stopped. You guys need a conversation because he obviously appreciates the time and thought you\u2019ve put into your gifts more than you realize.", "YTA.

He didn\u2019t want to hurt your feelings when you kept giving him things that aren\u2019t his taste, so he just said thanks. Maybe he doesn\u2019t think origami needs to be saved forever?

I mostly agree with the N-A-H votes, but I do think it is important to acknowledge that your husband is right.\n\nHe IS a waste of time \u2026 when it comes to homemade gifts. He doesn\u2019t like them! Not even the food! He doesn\u2019t even appreciate them! He prefers luxury gifts!\n\nBut I\u2019m wondering if your husband lacks self-awareness (this is harsher sounding than I intend. A lot of people have these types of blind spots!) here. He clearly is supportive of your crafting. He might not even have registered how he was reacting to your crafted gifts, so it might not have registered to him mentally that while he supports your crafting, he doesn\u2019t appreciate it himself. So your approach might feel harsher to him than it really is because he might not even realize that he has repeatedly dismissed the gifts when he is the recipient.\n\nAs multiple other people have said, I think the two of you need to talk.", "Nta. I like to make handmade gifts too, but my husband is like your husband.\n\nI stopped making crafty stuff for him and now only make food or baked goods for him to show my love.\n\nIt's a good compromise. We just have different love languages, that's all.", "NTA\n\nI've read all your comments to people who are hell bent on claiming your the ah.  You've tried open communication and not gotten anywhere.  With him not willing to voice his actual feelings you had no option but to take his actions and assume his feelings.  Why would you spend time and effort to make something for someone who doesn't want it.  It's not about him not being worth it, it's about seeing what he values.  He wants luxury items.  You now give him luxury items.\n\nThe only advice I can offer to get him over this will probably result in him feeling guilty but he has to hear it.  Just tell him the facts.  Tell him you have consistently noticed over the last decade of you being together that he fully supports your crafting hobby but doesn't appreciate the end product for himself.  Tell him that's ok.  That you love seeing him genuinely happy and braggy over the luxury gifts you buy for him.  That it brings you joy to see that, while him barely looking at similarily crafted items before inevitably throwing them away brought you sadness.  That you both deserve to be happy and gifting him luxury items accomplishes that.  If he starts to argue the fact tell him the valid examples you have told all us:  the espresso cups you made by hand only to be donated a month later vs the expensively bought ones for him that he still uses now.  How excited he is to brag about the wallet you bought for him, that he's lovingly cared for for years now. \n\nAs a crafter it can be hard to acknowledge that handmade items aren't for everyone.  My husband loves that I craft and is incredibly supportive of it. But we both have acknowledged that it's not his style.  Therefore, I've never made him anything.  It doesn't stop him from admiring my work and telling me how great I am at it and how proud he is of me.  He's supportive in every other aspect of your crafting.  He doesn't have to want the items too (and I say this for him to know...not you since you seem to already understand that)", "You would have received a pound of chocolate if I had received an ounce of gratitude.", "NTA.

Are the luxury items useable compared to the ones you make or stuff he enjoys? \n\nFor example: you make him a blanket, but there\u2019s also 4 blankets he owns or you make him origami but there\u2019s no real use for it outside of decorations. \n\nHonestly it just seems like a lot of miscommunication on both ends. He clearly loves you because he\u2019ll pay for classes or organize your craft projects, but gift giving/receiving isn\u2019t his love language.", "NTA. He's being manipulative. I personally love it when my partner makes me a gift or gives me something personalized. To me, that shows a lot more thought went into the gift, and that she cates enough to give the time or effort, or even if it's something she buys, she gets things that are thoughtful and personalized.", "What a weirdly manipulative thing to say, NTA", "NTA. He's acting like a baby.", "NTA notice he ignored the entire point and hooked onto the last thing you said and tried to make it seem like an insult. It\u2019s a classic manipulative tactic made to win arguments. I can\u2019t say he\u2019s doing it on purpose but the fact remains he completely ignored the part where you said making something that will be tossed in the trash without being enjoyed is a waste of your time and he tried to spin it on you.\n\nDon\u2019t be sorry and don\u2019t fall for manipulation. Instead, if he does being I up (I have a feeling he will passive aggressively) be direct. It is a waste of time making something that gets thrown out instead of being used. So are you going to start using them, or are still going to just keep throwing them out?", "NAH. He liked that you made him things because it meant you care. You don't want to make him things anymore because you feel it's a waste of time. The labor of love is a waste of time. I get why he said what he did and feels the way he did. You're upset that he didn't appear to appreciate the things you made. He obviously did, he just didn't show it well enough. He didn't twist your words, he told you how those words made him feel. Listen to him.", "I get that you don't appreciate him throwing away your gifts.  That would be hurtful to me too.\n\nBut it sounds like he appreciated the thought behind your gifts and just never expressed it.\n\nAlso, I think you may need to think about gift-giving in a slightly different way. Homemade gifts are great, but they aren't all meaningful to the person who receives them. Meaningful gifts speak to the interests and needs of the receipient. Origami creations are decorative and appeal to people who are into decoratives.  But your husband does not sound like this kind of person. However, I am guessing he is a fan of chocolate and other consumables.  It kind of isn't fair to conclude he doesn't like your homemade gifts just because he hasn't been a huge fan of some of your homemade gifts. \n\nNAH.", "NTA. He is completely the asshole. He\u2019s twisted your words to make himself the victim because he doesn\u2019t like you made him feel bad.

I'm dealing with a similar situation and it's to the point where I rather just not say anything cause he makes me feel crazy afterwards", "NTA\n\nHe sounds like one of those people that think gifting handmade gifts is being cheap.

Something I've grown to accept during my twenty years of marriage is that over time it's really the thought that counts.\n\nMy wife and I have different hobbies and likes and while I might not love what my wife makes and vice versa we still love the fact that we share things with other.\n\nTalk with your husband that while you appreciate how he supports your hobbies but you're just a little upset about how he reacts to the stuff you give him.  Also maybe ask him how to incorporate some of his interests into your hobbies, just a thought.", "OP is NTA but I agree the husband here has twisted the wording to suit his narrative.

I don't think your husband is just \"twisting your words,\" as others have said. I think that your crafting, for you, results in a \"gift\" that you give. You are hurt because he isn't cherishing the end result, which is the *physical* gift. I think what your husband is saying is that the gift, to him, is the time and effort you put into creating something. The *time and effort* you spend, with him in mind, is the gift. When you said it was a waste of your time, he may have interpreted that he was not worth what he considered to be the *gift* (the time and effort). Sometimes, it is just the thought that matters.\n\nYou may also want to reconsider the type of gifts you give him. Look at what he's giving you: crafting classes, paper for origami, tidying your knitting. These are things you can *use.* Maybe the gifts he'll respond to are also gifts he can use, rather than gifts that are meant to display (you may already be giving those types of gifts). \n\n>I have also made him foodstuffs before, including his mum\u2019s recipes which if someone is blind testing the two versions are completely identical. \n\nHe may love this particular food, and it could be identical to how his mum makes it, but it's not *identical.* His mum making it is the *gift*, and you can't recreate that (he may also secretly hate it, but he eats it because of the association of the gift and his mum).\n\nI think you need to communicate that you were hurt that he wasn't cherishing the *physical gifts* you made, but also let him know that he is not a waste of your time. It may be worth discussing what types of gifts he'd like to receive, but my guess is that it wouldn't matter as much as the meaning behind it.

I also love crafts where you make little trinkets, but I mostly keep them in a box or give them away because I don\u2019t like the look of little trinkets all over my living space.

The way you show love and affection is through thoughtful gifts.  Your husband shows it by paying attention to your crafting supplies (among other things, I assume).   You need to ask why he likes receiving handmade items from you, and what specifically he likes receiving.
