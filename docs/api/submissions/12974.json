Why would you spend all that time making things when he doesn't appreciate them enough to keep them or use them. He's being childish and unfair.", ">He got all quiet and said he didn\u2019t realise he was a waste of my time.\n\nI think he just twisted your words. You make all these handmade gifts for him that are unappreciated, and even thrown into the bin but he's the victim? What about him hurting your feelings and not appreciating your hard work? He's now getting gifts he likes, so it's not like he's missing out.\n\nNTA You should tell him how much other people appreciate your homemade gifts. And then compare his underwhelming reactions. He's clearly not appreciating your perspective.", "If he can\u2019t appreciate the work and time going into handmade gifts, then *he\u2019s* wasting *your* time. NTA. \n\nThrowing it in the bin is just a plain rude AH move.", "NTA. He's purposely misrepresenting what you said. I'm assuming you do still get him gifts. How does he understand those if not that you value him?", "NTA\n\nHe twisted your word", "NTA Been there, done that. You two need to talk so you can let him know that you were hurt when he just disposed of the things you spent time making for him. This is fixable because he doesn't sound like an AH either, just unaware of the consequences of throwing away your acts of love. Because, intentionally or not, he was doing exactly that. So tell him. Calmly, of course.", "NTA - he's quite childish about it. and not considerate of your feelings on the issue.", "What kind of thing your husband got from you?", "NTA does he often twist your words around like that?", "NAH.\n\nWhat we've got here is, failure to communicate.\n\nSeems pretty obvious that he liked recieving the gifts because of  the intangibles- you thinking about him, you putting effort into giving him something- that can mean a lot in a relationship and can matter way more than the material aspect of the gift\n\nAlso of course you didn't mean to imply he was a waste of time based on the comment- you enjoy what you do and want to feel valued and one of the ways to feel valued is by seeing your craft in use. Consequently, seeing what you made being put aside can feel pretty dismissive, even if that wasn't the intent. He should understand how you could feel that way and not generalize to a broader conclusion.", "I mean... yeah you could've communicated earlier but damn...this is funny.\n\n\n\nNTA\n\n\nHe plays the victim pretty well", "NTA\n\nHowever...it does sound likenhe liked your gifts.\n\nAnd taking a big hint...give him food gifts lol Or practical home made gifts...that have a long term use.\n\nI am similar in some ways...highly practical so I struge with what to do with home made gifts. I am guilty of having got them, loved them, stuck them in a drawer and then thrown them years later. I absolutely appreciated them...but didn't know what to do with them long term.", "NAH. With handmade gifts it's always better to ask the person in advance what they'd like, especially if you're going to invest a large amount of time in it. Your husband might like receiving something you make because it gives him a part in your hobby (his actions also seem to indicate this: refilling your supplies, helping to organize your basket etc.). Just talk to him calmly and from a place of love, let him know that he is worthy of your time and get a list of things that he would like you to make for him, so that your future gifts don't end up unused.", "NAH\n\nI can't call either of you AHs. He ia obviously super supportive and you want your work valued. But for your own sake, communicate! Why not ask him which crafts he likes or whether he wants trinkets? He may be confused about what to do with an origami animal (which seems plausible if he helps you tidy up. Maybe he doesn't like clutter), but a chocolate is totally different and has more purpose. Why not spend your time making stuff that he would like? Similar to how gift giving is centred around what the recipient likes and not what the gifter wants to gift. He's hurt though because it doesn't sound great to be told that you're not worth effort and maybe he feels bad. But without having a conversation, you gave him no chance to rectify it.\n\nI'm saying this as a fellow crafter. My Mum loves my random crocheted animals but god knows my husband would have no clue what to do with them. So I don't make them for him. But if he wanted a knitted hat, I'd make that.", "NAH. This is a simple communication issue. Your husband definitely twisted your words, whether deliberately or because of his own insecurities or plain old misunderstanding.  This part needs to be discussed, with you being crystal clear about what you meant.  I would also let him know that if it was deliberate, that you will not respond to guilt trips or manipulations because that's not acceptable.  I've personally had a similar reaction to my partner saying something was a waste of time, and felt like he was saying I was a waste of time/taking the time for whatever it was *with me specifically* was a waste of time, which still made me feel like he was saying I was the waste of time. Idk if that made sense at all, but basically I've had what was essentially a trauma response that was similar to the situation with your husband.\n\n>he knows I enjoy it and he encourages me to do it. He\u2019ll pay for me to go to classes I\u2019ve talked about, or my origami paper supply will magically refill itself and the basket with my knitting supplies is always tidy even if I know I didn\u2019t put it back so carefully.\n\nThis is actually kind of adorable, and from an outside view seems supportive and caring, which also makes me lean towards him twisting your words not being a deliberate manipulation attempt.  \n\nAnother POV that may or may not be helpful: I personally have a super hard time with knick knacks and little cluttery things, they just sit around getting dusty and it makes me anxious. So stuff my kids make at school? They end up buried in a drawer even though I love that they made me something. I just.... Don't know what to do with it, and eventually about 75% of the things end up in the trash a couple years later.  It's definitely not a lack of appreciation though, and it doesn't mean I want them to stop making me cute little doodads - even ones that are \"useless\" (aka just for fun or decoration, no actual purpose).  But I will say that things that have a tangible use are even more meaningful for me, because it shows that they've been paying attention to see what I need/want/will actually have a use for.  I hope that helps!!", "Nah.  Just a misunderstanding", "YTA \nYou said you stopped gifting him stuff but never told him why until he asked.

The husband sounds like a pretty considerate guy, so I wouldn't jump to the assumption that he purposefully twisted OP's words right away. Having a proper talk about it might be really helpful. OP could explain that it just seemed better to get him gifts that he would actually appreciate instead of something he'll stuff away, and the husband could maybe talk about if the sudden change made it seem like he mattered less than other people or something. And then a consensus could be reached, like maybe he does like handmade gifts but only of a specific type? Food better than trinkets for example. \n\nIn any case, talk to each other, its the biggest part of making a relationship work.", "NAH - you both hurt each other's feelings and you're not actually talking about it, you're talking around it. Honest conversation time.", "YTA. You wrote a lot about how he doesn't want hand made clothing items, and then the actual interaction is about a hand made food item. You're presenting the story in bad faith. Classifying all of that together as \"hand made goods\" is oversimplifying the conflict here.", "He can appreciate the gifts without wanting them or knowing what to do with them. He absolutely twisted your words but it is possible he liked that you were thinking of him and spending effort on him even if he didn't actually like the gift or know what to do with them. It's probably not malicious if he's refilling your paper and helping you keep your yarn straightened up. I hate how disrespectful people are to craft people but that might be the way you need to approach a future conversation. I'm saying NAH unless him twisting your words was malicious and he does it often. \n\nOr he is jealous that everyone else got chocolates. I would be but I also love origami so I would be thrilled about that too. I can't imagine someone giving me pottery they made. I'd probably cry.", "NAH but you guys need to communicate better.\n\nHe obviously likes the handmade stuff more than you think. And him not using them hurts you more than he thinks. \n\nI would guess the solution is something along the lines of: give him handmade stuff that can be eaten or otherwise meant to be used then discarded. Not long-lasting stuff like crocheted blankets or scarves. A home can only take so many crocheted items before it becomes overwhelming, imo. \n\nBut the solution is not what I say, it is what you 2 agree on. Best of luck to you both!", "Yta for not communicating with your partner and just deciding one day they're not worth the effort because you just didn't feel like making him any more things and talking to him about why was too exhaustive to try.", "soft YTA. have you ever actually ASKED him what he would like or if he liked the gifts? i do the same thing he does with handmade things, store them. that doesn't mean i dont like them and it can be the same for him. he does all these things concerning your hobbies and you tell him making something for him is a waste of time. it clearly upset him, he clearly liked the gifts. its not like he threw them away, HE STORED THEM SAFELY. op you really need to remember that not everyone shows they like things the same way and consider how your husband feels because i know id feel like you stopped really caring about me if i were him. also kind of sad you came to reddit to see if you were right instead if idk, TALKING TO HIM ABOUT IT TO SEE HIS SIDE. go communicate with him instead of looking for validation on something crappy you did", "NTA. Does he often twist your words to make you out to be the bad guy?", "Wow. That's some gaslighting happening there.  \n\n\nIt doesn't seem you two have big issues, but that was a sad remark of him to make and that makes you NTA.", "NTA.  that's gaslighting at its finest.

The epitome of gaslighting", "NTA but a proper conversation won't hurt since he has twisted your words here", "NTA you are right why waste time when he doesn't show consideration to your hard work....", "NTA. \n\nIf he says it again, respond with: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t like feeling like trash and that\u2019s how it feels when they disappear.\u201d", "NTA\nHe got all quiet because he needed a moment to think of how his dismissive behavior when given lovingly crafted gifts could be deflected. So he boldly turned his treating your loving efforts as trash to a slanted interpretation where he's the victim of your devaluing him! Quite the mental acrobat.", "Nta\nSuch a jerk move for him to expect your time to make things he throws away and then twist your words into getting more", "One sentence to make himself the victim when you are the one who should be hurt. NTA", "NTA, I have a foster sister like this. Spent months making her a bisquit quilt, only for her to shove it in the shed, let the cat piss all over it, and throw it away still in the gift bag. So never again. I make things for everyone but her, she only wants purchased things", "NTA only a fucking man would be able to twist that into somehow him being the victim. he sounds like a fucking child", "NTA but at some point I wish one of you had communicated earlier. \u201cDo you like my handmade gifts, or would you prefer something like a gift card to the spa?\u201d  Or \u201c I really love your hobbies and things that you make, and they are great gifts for others, but not really my thing. Here is what I would like for my birthday.\u201d", "Alternatively, as the saying goes, \u201cit\u2019s the thought that counts\u201d. He could understand and appreciate the effort that goes into making something, but still hold the view that this crocheted necktie isn\u2019t really his style, or that his desk won\u2019t look better with yet another origami crane on it. \n\nIf, as OP implies, his immediate reaction to every gift is to walk to the nearest garbage can and throw it away, sure, he\u2019d be an asshole, but I suspect she magnifies that in her mind. Could he do more, sometimes, to more obviously use the drip-glazed coffee mug, the way you hang your kid\u2019s artwork on the fridge? Sure, seems likely. \n\nBut he\u2019s not wrong in thinking OP has decided \u201cit\u2019s not worth doing what *I* perceive as nice things for him anymore\u201d: that is *literally* what she decided.", "Absolutely! OP, it sounds like your husband recognizes the emotional value of your gifts but isn't the kind of person who sentimentaluzes the objects themselves. If it bothers you that he puts things away or tosses them out, give him things like chocolates that are meant to be eaten or shared but not kept forever.", "She literally says \u201cso I stopped gifting him stuff mid world shutdown\u201d.
