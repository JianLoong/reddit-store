His ex-wife is homophobic and is still coming to terms with his sexuality.**\n\n**edit: he is my husband but we recently got married and I'm used to saying boyfriend.**\n\n**EDIT: I feel like I should clarify that I am not involved with the kids and likely won't ever get too involved.

My husband wants to say yes, but I'm really not interested. I feel like we've already put in a lot of effort for Christmas and I don't want to spend another holiday with the kids, especially if it's going to involve a lot of fighting and stress.\n\nI've tried explaining this to my husband, but he just says that it's not fair to the kids and that we should be more understanding. He also thinks because the kids have been so accepting of me we should have them around for NYE as well.\n\nI feel like I'm being selfish, but I also don't want to spend another holiday with the kids if it's going to be as stressful as Christmas was.\n\nAITA for not wanting to spend New Year's Eve with my husband's kids?", "created_utc": 1672428752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zz98hz/aita_for_not_wanting_to_spend_new_years_eve_with/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would just say that you are in tune with your feelings and honest.  Kids are a lot of work, and the scenario you described at Christmas is normal.

Children aren't dumb at all and their choices to handle this as if your husband isn't gay and doesn't have this while other life is damaging and sets an example that they should be ashamed of who he is. His ex wife gets to use his sexuality as a weapon to guilt him into this pretend life (and, I am completely assuming here, the custody arrangements and when convenient for her who spends holidays where, etc.) And here you are with your own space and your own life and a husband who doesn't fully allow you into his life but holds you hostage to it? \n\nEveryone needs therapy here.

You're getting a bit ripped apart in the comments I think, but no one is really trying to explain *why*, and I'm gonna try because I feel like this comment of yours sheds some light on what's going on.  \n\nYou married a dude with kids, with whom you do not have much of a relationship.  The kids live with their mom full-time, and their dad visits them at *their* home.  So, this is your problem.  You see it as \"your\" space, vs \"their\" space.  The kids don't see it that way.  Whether or not they can articulate it, they want to feel safe, loved, and cared for wherever the parents they love are.  You get to live with their dad.  They don't get why you do, and they don't.  To them, they should get to be where their mom is, and where their dad is. And they're kids.  They have the *right* to feel safe wherever their parents are.  So in their mind, even though they don't live there, you are the invader in dad's house.  You are the threat that says they may not be welcome there.  And that behavior shows in them pushing boundaries, disrespecting your space, and not being grateful for presents.  You could've given them literally anything, and they would've acted ungrateful.  They wouldn't even understand WHY they're acting ungrateful, they would've just known it was from you, and they would've been pissy.  \n\nYour husband has some work to do, if he wants this to work.  He has to make sure that no matter his marital status, his children know they are a priority in his life.  He loves them, and he will always show up for them, and they are always welcome where he is.  He *has* to communicate that to them, both in word and action. \n\nYou have work to do if you want this to work.  You must forge your *own* relationship with them.  You married a guy with kids, it's simply not feasible that you can expect to remain a disinterested third party, kids know when someone doesn't like them or want them around.  They're smart buggers.  Don't be fake.  They smell fear.  You also have to recognize that for as long as you are married to their father, your home is their home.  They must be welcome there.  Always.  They have to know you will *never* **EVER** block them from seeing their father.  \n\nHe's your husband, but he was their father first.  A deadbeat dad is not a nice human being.  If you want him to be a good husband, he needs to be a good father first.  \n\nGood luck and God speed.", "Why did you get married before the kids \u201cwarmed up to\u201d you? That seems grossly irresponsible", "Get a key locking doorknob for your office so the kids aren\u2019t in there.

I have 2 of them myself and they bicker. It\u2019s my job as a parent to enforce fairness, taking turns, etc. And to impose age-appropriate consequences when they make poor behavior choices. \n\nIf your husband isn\u2019t doing that, then discuss that with him.
