His ex-wife is homophobic and is still coming to terms with his sexuality.**\n\n**edit: he is my husband but we recently got married and I'm used to saying boyfriend.**\n\n**EDIT: I feel like I should clarify that I am not involved with the kids and likely won't ever get too involved.

My husband wants to say yes, but I'm really not interested. I feel like we've already put in a lot of effort for Christmas and I don't want to spend another holiday with the kids, especially if it's going to involve a lot of fighting and stress.\n\nI've tried explaining this to my husband, but he just says that it's not fair to the kids and that we should be more understanding. He also thinks because the kids have been so accepting of me we should have them around for NYE as well.\n\nI feel like I'm being selfish, but I also don't want to spend another holiday with the kids if it's going to be as stressful as Christmas was.\n\nAITA for not wanting to spend New Year's Eve with my husband's kids?", "created_utc": 1672428752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zz98hz/aita_for_not_wanting_to_spend_new_years_eve_with/", "score": 190, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Children aren't dumb at all and their choices to handle this as if your husband isn't gay and doesn't have this while other life is damaging and sets an example that they should be ashamed of who he is.

The kids live with their mom full-time, and their dad visits them at *their* home.  So, this is your problem.  You see it as \"your\" space, vs \"their\" space.  The kids don't see it that way.  Whether or not they can articulate it, they want to feel safe, loved, and cared for wherever the parents they love are.  You get to live with their dad.  They don't get why you do, and they don't.  To them, they should get to be where their mom is, and where their dad is. And they're kids.  They have the *right* to feel safe wherever their parents are.  So in their mind, even though they don't live there, you are the invader in dad's house.  You are the threat that says they may not be welcome there.  And that behavior shows in them pushing boundaries, disrespecting your space, and not being grateful for presents.  You could've given them literally anything, and they would've acted ungrateful.  They wouldn't even understand WHY they're acting ungrateful, they would've just known it was from you, and they would've been pissy.  \n\nYour husband has some work to do, if he wants this to work.  He has to make sure that no matter his marital status, his children know they are a priority in his life.  He loves them, and he will always show up for them, and they are always welcome where he is.  He *has* to communicate that to them, both in word and action. \n\nYou have work to do if you want this to work.  You must forge your *own* relationship with them.  You married a guy with kids, it's simply not feasible that you can expect to remain a disinterested third party, kids know when someone doesn't like them or want them around.  They're smart buggers.  Don't be fake.  They smell fear.  You also have to recognize that for as long as you are married to their father, your home is their home.  They must be welcome there.  Always.  They have to know you will *never* **EVER** block them from seeing their father.  \n\nHe's your husband, but he was their father first.  A deadbeat dad is not a nice human being.

I have 2 of them myself and they bicker. It\u2019s my job as a parent to enforce fairness, taking turns, etc. And to impose age-appropriate consequences when they make poor behavior choices. \n\nIf your husband isn\u2019t doing that, then discuss that with him.

It would also help to know their ages.  If these are little kids (under eight or so), then the ungrateful type behavior is a bit more understandable.  Little kids, in particular, can be very self-absorbed and lack a filter, but that isn't necessarily that they are purposefully ungrateful.

You married a dad, so dealing with kids in whatever form should be a given HOWEVER you've been told from the start that you aren't allowed in their lives in ANY capacity. I.e you're not allowed to be around them on holidays, birthdays, HELL not even pop in on weekend visits. You're their step-dad, but you're not even ALLOWED to call yourself that. Besides, even though the kids were wreaking havoc, you weren't allowed to even SAY anything. I wouldn't want them over either, but my biggest concern is your husband and how he's been behaving in all this. Has HE come to gripes with his sexuality?!?!? When you marry a man and you have children, you have to allow your husband some kind of space in your life, not just hide him away and pretend he doesn't exist. Also, newfound sexuality aside, it's COMPLETELY and totally inappropriate for him to do birthdays, holidays, weekend visits, etc. with his EX-WIFE...AT HER HOUSE while he's married to someone else and you're not allowed! If he didn't want to leave her, he should just say that. I would seriously re-evaluate your marriage as it feels like he doesn't want to embrace any of the changes HE made to his own life and what that may look like for him and his children.", "I feel like I should clarify that I am not involved with the kids and likely won't ever get too involved. Him and ex wife are adamant that the kids know that they have 1 mother and 1 father and they don't want me to have a parental role and for the kids to think they have two dads.\n\nHe has another separate home to meet the kids during weekends cause they don't want me to be involved with the kids. Otherwise he meets them in their family home. They still celebrate easter and other major holidays and family events as a 'family' (him, his ex-wife and the kids) without me. His ex-wife is homophobic and is still coming to terms with his sexuality.", "After reading the comments a lot of people seem to be jumping down your throat. Saying \"you shouldn't have married someone with kids if you don't like them\" but the issue seems to be that the dad married you but doesn't want you to be in their life. I'd say ESH, the mom is acting homophobic and needs to accept what happened. The dad/husband needs to grow a pair and and stand up for you/your relationship. Their mentality of the kids have 1 mom and 1 dad may be true but now they also have 1 step dad. What will happen if the mom gets remarried? Will her new spouse also not be a parent? Honestly these reeks of internalized homophobia on the dad's side and just blatant homophobia on the mom's side. If I were in this position I'd have to give an ultimatum, either they accept that you are a part of the family and you take on the responsibility that comes with that or you leave the relationship.", "ESH \nI leaned towards Y T A but what made me realize that esh is that even though he married you, your husband has some Internalized homophobia as well as his ex-wife.  \nYou are a step parent and the fact that everyone somehow acting like the genders being the same makes that not true.  It\u2019s weird AF to marry someone with young children and then want no part of their life and to act as if you aren\u2019t even there.  And why are they so adamant on their stance? It comes off as super homophobic to need to make sure the kids know they have 1 mom and 1 dad and in no way is it acceptable to Acknowledge having stepdad who is married to their dad.", "NTA. It sounds like homophobic ex-wife wants to have her cake and eat it too. Let hubs keep them at their own house, lol.", "NTA. It seems like you\u2019re going down in flames here. But I think everyone who\u2019s saying Y T A is missing the very big point that your husband and his ex don\u2019t **want** you to have a relationship with the kids. You don\u2019t see them on a regular basis. They don\u2019t want the kids to see you as any type of parent figure. So when you were just with the kids for Christmas and it wasn\u2019t great, it\u2019s logical that you\u2019re not going to want them back a week later. Everyone who\u2019s saying that you married a guy with kids and you have to establish a relationship with them is ignoring the fact that you\u2019re hardly able to given the constraints you\u2019re under. Good luck, OP!", "Don\u2019t marry a guy with kids if you can\u2019t handle them being in your life.", "YTA. Kids bicker, kids fight, kids make messes and cause stress.

I\u2019m guessing that your husband is saying you won\u2019t be a father to relieve some pressure from you and the kids. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have your own relationship with the kids, and you don\u2019t have to be a doormat and let them terrorize you in your own home. If they come over, they need to respect you and your home, and act their age.", "YTA and a piece of work for settling down with a FATHER when you clearly know nothing about children. The lack of forethought, kindness and general priorities is embarrassing. Dealbreaker.", "NTA \n\nNot wanting you involved at all with the kids was their enforced choice. They cannot expect now a 180 from you without the proper adjustments which 1) require time and 2) clear boundaries on the parenting issues.", "Your husband is letting you into a very important part of his life.  Unfortunately the quickest way to alien his ex and him is reject their children. First and only visit is not enough time to create a comfortable relationship.  Don\u2019t give up.  Give it some more time.  Your husband needs to see you are trying.  Your husband does seem to feel the visit went well.  So talk to him about what worked about the visit and what didn\u2019t work.  Children are exhausting if you are not used to them; all that noisy energy!  Depending on their ages, find some activities earlier in the day to expend some of that energy.  Figure out what bothers you most and address the concerns one at a time.  If the office invasion was very upsetting, ask if you can set up a space with supplies for the kids to use and make the office off limits.", "YTA - but I get it! At the end of the day you're perfectly within your rights to want to have your own new years.. but you're dating a dad! He should always put his kids first and I'm sure while he'd love to spend new years with you he'd love the opportunity to spend it with his kids too. Plus it's great if they're being so accepting of you given the circumstances.  Just embrace it at this stage!", "ESH. You\u2019re unrealistic about the priority he should place on his kids versus you. That said, he and his ex are not allowing him to move on in a healthy way and your husband was never ready for a relationship. You\u2019re married and he\u2019s still trying to limit your involvement. As you noted, this is neither sustainable or healthy, particularly for the kids, who are innocent in their parents\u2019 immaturity.", "ESH but especially your husband and his ex. I think a lot of people aren\u2019t recognizing how weird of a position you have been put in by their \u201ccustody agreement.\u201d They want you removed from the picture so as not to confuse the kids but now that it\u2019s convenient for your husband to see his kids you\u2019re back in peripherally?? This won\u2019t work for long and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d even call it working right now. Plus the ex wife doesn\u2019t have to like or accept your husbands sexuality but the fact that she is likely handling this differently than if your husband were to remarry a cis women reeks of homophobia and I (also as a queer person) would not want to be anywhere remotely near this situation. All y\u2019all need therapy together.", "NTA, but maybe give them another chance.  Get  their father to have a talk about behavior first.  Their mother probably doesn't encourage them to be charming at your house.   You're with a man with kids .  They're part of the equation .  You might grow on each other", "I\u2019m going to say NTA and here is why. Unlike most other relationships with parents, the kids were never a real part of the equation for you. \n\nNaturally, I would understand your reluctance to want to engage with this. It\u2019s a complete departure from the life you have built with your husband. \n\nFor your husband, this is an amazing blessing because he now can finally connect the two most important parts of his life together. \n\nThat dichotomy, not properly worked through, talked about or understood, can potentially sink your relationship. Or, with the right process, it can bring you even closer to the man you obviously love dearly. And, you may find a lot of joy out of a new family as well. \n\nBut, it\u2019s ultimately your choice. In this situation, I\u2019d say you\u2019re NTA.", "I\u2019m sorry. Went through all the comments before I responded because I wanted to see all of your replies to everyone\u2019s questions and get as much of the picture as I could. You\u2019re definitely not trying to keep him from his kids which oddly a lot of people on here seem to think. You don\u2019t hate them or anything like that. You\u2019re more than a little stressed because he and his ex have put you in a super difficult position. They, not you have said that THEY don\u2019t want you to be in a parenting role. I understand that my fianc\u00e9 has the same expectation of me. However my fianc\u00e9 does understand that asking them not to do something or saying something (as politely as possible, without getting angry) to them when they\u2019ve crossed a line such as messing up your office isn\u2019t messing up a boundary. It\u2019s a respect issue not a parenting one. You live there/work there. It\u2019s your home just as much as it\u2019s his/their home when they are there. You have rights too. No you\u2019re not the asshole. I\u2019m sorry but your husband needs to stop letting his ex treat you badly by proxy. And yes that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s got him so beat down and afraid of what might happen that he\u2019s not able to parent or deal with his children as he should. I think you\u2019re awesome. I\u2019ll be honest if my fianc\u00e9 was acting like your husband I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have stayed. Even if they don\u2019t want you to parent the kids they still need to respect you and the way he and his ex have things right now that\u2019s not happening and it\u2019s definitely not ok. I hope you guys are able to work things out. Sorry about the people who obviously aren\u2019t reading everything. Have a talk with your husband about boundaries and respect please. Spoiling the kids and letting them and his ex treat you badly by proxy isn\u2019t ok. Not the asshole", "After reading your comments, I recommend staying out of the kids lives until they figure out their parenting/coparenting. I would tell him to spend new years with his kids at his second home or their family home and make your own plans. So I think YTA if you wanted him with no kids. But you\u2019re being walked all over in this situation and unfortunately you\u2019re going to be the bad guy in the kids lives if this continues.", "I empathize with you OP. It seems you need to have a frank discussion with your husband. He\u2019s made it clear you weren\u2019t to be a part of your life, but suddenly he\u2019s throwing you all together with very little warning. I think NTA, but maybe he can go spend new years with them at the other house and try to ease into a regular relationship for the children and you as the year goes on. You\u2019re expected to be an instant stepdad while being kept from being exactly that for 3 years.\nOn the other hand, maybe planning a fun new years for the kids and you both will be a great way to build those relationships.", "YTA From your comments you seem to get why your husband is being a doormat and treating you like an afterthought when it comes to his ex wife and you seem to realize there is a lot of work he needs to do internally as well as why what they are currently doing with the kids isn't a good idea. BUT in order for anything to change , you need to take what you can get as far as being involved with the kids. The only way they are going to get used to you and how to behave in your space is if they spend time around you.  Once you stop being some secret novelty their dad is hiding you can be an adult who can help steer (not parent or discipline) how they're visits go. Also, I'd bet money the ex wife is seeing someone and that's why she's suddenly more amenable to the kids spending time wirh you guys.", "After reading your comments: I am sorry this is such a tough situation. Is there any chance that you could maybe have the kids over but set precise boundaries with your husband regarding behavior and discipline and perhaps lock your office/ anything breakable?", "Soft YTA! You never had the kids overnight and for weekends. It\u2019s stressful for both you and the kids. Not to mention the adrenaline kids get from Christmas! I have six kids and every Christmas is exhausting! New years can be a fun holiday with kids. Wear them out buy having them help make a special dinner, or in our case many fun appetizers and a fun dessert, then watch a fun movie and if y\u2019all are still awake enjoy watching the NYE countdown into the new year. Try and see it through the kids eyes as an exciting experience. I get it, you\u2019re not used to the chaos. But the kids will settle down after the holidays.

I feel for you babe, I seriously do. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t let them come, you would be the asshole here, but also you and your husband need to set firm boundaries to make this holiday a better one.

Maybe you should find a partner who doesn't have kids but it's not this guy.", "NTA for feeling the way you do, but YTA if you pressure him to make him say no to having the kids. You knew he was a father and time with kids is precious. Kids fight and are messy....so you need to get over that.", "ESH (except the kids)\n\nKids should come first, and that means having to be inconvenienced sometimes. So you are going to need to be more flexible.\n\nNeither parent is doing the kids any favors by maintaining a fake family for their sake. They\u2019re old enough to know there is something going on, and it is probably making things uncomfortable for them. \n\nThe ex trying to pretend that same sex couples don\u2019t exist is wrong no matter how you look at it. I doubt she would be so difficult if your husband married another woman. The whole dynamic of their dad\u2019s new marriage may be a bit confusing to the kids, but that\u2019s the case in any instance of divorce and regardless of the couple\u2019s genders. \n\nI know this is a stereotypical response to a lot of posts, but the one thing they should be doing as co-parents is THERAPY. I cannot stress enough how important that can be in navigating a new normal, which is what is happening here. Mom and Dad are no longer together, and Dad is re-married. It\u2019s a ton of change for kids to cope with, and neither parent seems to be willing to admit it.\n\nA therapist is a neutral third party as well, and won\u2019t be subject to the guilt trip your husband is getting from his ex. They can also provide helpful tips on adjusting the kids to the change. The kids definitely need therapy as well, because it sounds like their coping mechanism is to act out. At some point you should probably be included as well.\n\nThis arrangement sounds extremely unhealthy and is creating a false reality for everyone involved.

The behaviors you described are pretty typical for children, and while it\u2019s reasonable to suggest your husband needs to regulate them better, he may not be in the best position to do so. \n\nHowever, the bigger issue here is that your husband isn\u2019t fully invested in his new marriage, he is still playing the heterosexual married man with his wife, while keeping you on the side. I\u2019m saying this as a gay married man with children myself: you are setting yourself up for failure here. \n\nYou\u2019re coming up with excuses in your comments about how coming out is a journey, and how it\u2019s more challenging for married men, particularly within older generations. While there is some truth in that, these are still issues that he has a responsibility to deal with. Your marriage is partly in the closet, your husband is separating the various parts of his personal life, and you are very clearly being treated like a third wheel to their family unit. While it\u2019s great he\u2019s trying to give his children as much normalcy as possible, the manner in which he is doing it is unhealthy and unreasonable. Your husband needs to learn to come to terms with himself, to respect his marriage to you, and to integrate his personal life better. \n\nIt also sounds like you yourself are neither interested, nor prepared, to facilitate his children.

The role for you is step-parent and that's different from either of the others.

(And you seem to be the only one of you who can see that) I understand there are certain the only choice is a bad choice feelings a man of a certain generation can have involving his queerness as you said in another previous comment, but your husband has to figure out how to untangle the fallout from that. Because while I can sympathize with the ex wife struggling to come to terms with creating a family with a gay man, both she and he need to start figuring out how to heal the hurt that's caused (and is causing the kids and you as well) Tbh the only thing I think might make your marriage work is counseling on all fronts, both individually and family. Your ex wife in law really needs to come to terms with your husband's sexuality and your husband needs to step out of his comfort zone a bit to heal and for your relationship to work.", "What do you mean by that? He is gay, fine. And has nothing to do with shame. \n\nHe married a woman nad had two children full well knowing that he is gay.

Not fair to his children and not fair to the wife, even if you try to paint her in a bad light. \n\nHe was the one who betrayed her trust. Not by being gay, but by not telling her until children came into play. \n\nI don't know about gay people, but I knew I am straight since at least I was 14 years... Well before my children were even a remote idea. I have hunch your sexuality functions a lot like mine... so do you honestly tell me that it takes the better part of at least 30 years to figure out that the woman you married is not only not your love, but you don't even have an interest in her entire gender? \n\nCome on.... \n\nAnd he doesn't need to tip toe around his ex wife.

Good luck to you, blended families can be hard.", "Ok I know it is excruciatingly hard to hide who u are sexually or otherwise from the world and/or those u love. But just bc someone has to go through that pain does not mean they shld hurt others. While ur husband might love his ex he hurt her in a way u can't imagine and the fact that she allows u around her kids toe tellse she's a a more decent human than me.    \nHonestly, and I'm truly trying to be respectful here bc I know it's so hard to discriminated against and hiding urself, I don't care if gay men (or lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, etc) think they love the women they married as covers, unless the women knew, the pain that inflicts on them is just cruel. And it honestly just makes them seem like they love themselves more than anyone else bc every single one of their actions is for their self preservation.\n\nNext as for the generational argument u use to excuse the hurt ur husband has inflicted (and as a \"geriatric\" millennial I feel I can speak to that bc u mentioned specifically 40 and over gay men in ur comment) honestly it's kind of even worse.  Listen I get in the conservative religous households it cld be hell but honestly the gen xers and late boomers had more options, that older generations fought hard for, than lieing to a women for over a decade and then side swiping her with his AP.  Bc seriously u had an emotional affair which as I get older I can tell u can be more devastating. he basically (whether he loves her or not) used her and divorced her when her usefulness was over.\n\nAlso, it sounds like u and ur husband make decent money so he had even more options than others. He was just scared which I feel for, but does not excuse the pain inflicted on others. Seriously, gay men need realize the harm they do to women when they do this (I won't even touch the misogyny within the gay community that kinda excuses the behavior).  If u tell her out right hey can we have this type of marriage and she agrees,  great but if not u are robbing her of her agency and to many women their self-respect. So yea she's gonna need more than three years, bc I'm guessing u guys got together right away, to adjust. \n\nAlso, do not patronizingly tell me that sexuality is complicated ur, I'm guessing, young self needs to recognize it was the generations before u that made being open about sexuality and being true to oneself (and there's more work to done) more normal. Just bc sexuality is complicated doesn't mean u get a hall pass to hurt others while figuring out urs.", "I can't see any other way of resolving it for you all. I wish you all the best of luck.

A Bit easy, don't you think?", "I will keep the generational argument. There is a lot of sociology and social psychology research into this topic. There are many factors. Not too long ago being gay was criminalised.\n\nI am not denying that those women suffer a lot. That's why family therapy is needed for everyone involved. Everyone suffers sadly but that is what homophobia does which is the root cause.\n\nSadly there are gay men who instead of coming out and going through the tough part of divorce cheat on their wives for years. Which is so much worse. No matter how long it took, he was honest with her. He came out."]}
