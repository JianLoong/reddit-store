{"id": 12919, "submission_id": "11yjgw8", "title": "AITA for removing my little brother from my home?", "selftext": "My mom has 7 kids, 4 of us are now adults and 3 are still minors. 7 months ago my mom lost custody. My 17 year old brother went to live with his dad full-time and my 11 year old twin siblings came to live with me. I'm married and have a 6 year old son and 2 year old daughter. We live in a 3 bedroom house so my brother shared with my son and my sister shared with my daughter.\n\nMy sister is great to have around, she's really helpful and fits into our household well. My brother on the other hand is more difficult. He's always been badly behaved but now he's just so angry all the time. I don't blame him for this, I know he's just reacting to his circumstances and his anger is just hiding how upset he is, but it doesn't make it any easier. We have him in therapy, my husband got him to take up boxing, we give him lots of individual attention. We've tried all kinds of different rewards and punishments to curb his bad behavior but nothing has helped much. \n\nTwo weeks he was suspended from school. He ended up spending the week with our uncle. At first it was just during the day but he ended up sleeping over Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday night. When he came back home Saturday he said he had a good time and seemed happier that he had in a while. My uncle also said that he didn't really have any issues all week and my brother was fairly well behaved. After discussing with my brother, my uncle, my mom, and his social worker, he is going to go and live with our uncle.  \n\nI wouldn't say my brother is happy or sad about moving in with our uncle. When I've asked his opinion he had only said he doesn't mind/doesn't care. My older brother thinks I'm an ass for separating the twins and that whoever they live with they should be together. He has even offered to take both of them but I know my sister wouldn't like that because our brother has 6 sons and no daughters. I also think it would be a bad idea because he already has 6 kids and right now the twins need a lot of individual attention. Despite feeling like I'm doing the right thing for my brother I am still feeling a lot of guilt for being someone else who is abandoning him and pawning of to another family member.

Your little brother seems happier with his uncle and maybe living in a quieter environment will help him find healthier outlets for the anger he\u2019s feeling. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad that the twins aren\u2019t going to live together for now\u2014and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going into foster care or being abandoned all together. Keep in touch with him, set up play dates or invite him over for dinner so he can still see you and his twin sister, and make sure he knows that you love him, want him to be happy and that if things don\u2019t work out with his uncle, he\u2019s always got a place to stay with you.\n\nAlso, just want to say kudos to you for caring so much! I imagine it hasn\u2019t been easy dealing with all of this and it clear that you really care about your younger siblings and want them to be okay.\n\nEdit: misunderstood who had six boys", "NTA - I bet that little girl is more than happy to be separated from her twin. They aren't salt & pepper shakers. Your older brother is entitled to his opinion, but you're the one who has to live with your decisions. If the boy is better with the uncle, let him be with the uncle.", "NTA.  \n\nIf he is going to be better off and happier with your uncle then doing what is in his best interests is more important than an arbitrary rule to keep siblings together.     Since keeping your sister with you seems like what is best for her, that is also the right thing to do for her.\n\nIt sounds like you are a good sister who is looking out for the wellbeing of both of your siblings.  Their will being is more important than the opinion of other family members.\n\nEdit: if he is happier with his uncle I don't think he will feel like you are abandoning him, especially if he is involved with the decision.", "NTA - It sounds like your 11yo brother needs the individualized time and attention right now. As long as there are plenty of opportunities for your him and your 11yo sister (and you and the other siblings) to spend time together, I don't see a problem with this. Keep the lines of communication with your 11yo brother open (make sure you still check in with him one on one in-person regularly) and make sure that he knows he is welcome back at your house if he ever wants that. \n\nI think you and your uncle need to be prepared for some of the behavioral issues to resurface once this new living arrangement is permanent rather than temporary. Kids react different in different situations. How he acts as a \"guest\" at his uncles might be different than how he acts when that is home. \n\nAlso - don't see this as giving up on your brother. You are trying to find the best possible living situation for him and have acknowledged that that may not be with you. You are only giving up on him if you don't work to maintain a relationship with him when he is no longer under your roof.", "The kids are reacting to a sudden breakup of their home environment. You sister is coping in your home, but her twin brother is not. The priority here should be to find each kid a home where they will be treated well, and where they feel happy and safe. Looks like the arrangement where sister twin stays with you and brother twin stays with your uncle fulfils those criteria. \n\nKeeping the twins together is not as important. The twins still get to live with family who care for them. Your brother's proposal would make life more difficult for sister twin, who should not be de-prioritized just to accommodate  her twin brother. And who is to say the brother twin will adapt well to your brother's home with 6 other boys?\n\nNTA and good on your family for taking care of your siblings", "NTA. Some twins are so close they feel like they're part of one another. Other twins hate each other. There's no reason they should be forced together if this is what makes the most sense right now. It doesn't have to be permanent forever. \n\nGood on you for taking them in to begin with.", "Info: how close is the uncle living to you and your younger sister? How often can the twins see each other outside of school (given they still visit the same school)?", "NTA.\n\nIf you're happy, your son is happy, your uncle is happy with this situation, that's what matters.\n\nBUT\n\nI would continue to investigate what the cause for his anger is towards you, and why he is more well behaved with the uncle, because him living there can't be permanent.", "I honestly think this is above our pay grade. You sound like amazing people so NTA, but I personally would not separate them unless he specifically asked to go. But I would talk to the therapist and ask her her opinion on the matter. Does your uncle have kids? Maybe he does better in an environment with less kids, who knows. But bouncing around to another home and being permanently separated from his twin at 11 sounds like a lot for a kid that age. Please let him know you want him with you but you care about his happiness more than anything.", "NTA. It sounds as if the one-on-one attention is good for him. There really is not going to be a right answer in this case. Do what suits him best for now. I assume that the twins go to the same school so they'll see each other there? And if the brother is 15 minutes away, then there are plenty of opportunities to see each other.", "I'm going to say NTA because you're just doing the best you can in this situation. I would definitely keep the kids in therapy and make sure they can see each other. It's all your mom's fault honestly.", "NTA. It's a tough situation. You want to do what's best for everyone, which includes your own children, in addition to your sister and brother. It is very stressful for the entire family when you're living with an angry, troubled tween. You're using positive reinforcement and your brother is in therapy, so you're using good strategies. However, your brother did behave better with his uncle and doesn't seem to have strong feelings against going to live with him. I'd say try it and see how it works out. Assure your brother he can come back to your home if he wants and make sure he has as much contact with his sister as they want. Therapy is crucial. I hope it works out for everyone.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA because it seems like you both are trying to do what\u2019s best for the kids. I would suggest talking to them both individually first and seeing how they feel about being together/split up and go from there personally though.", "I think you found the best solution for a very difficult situation. It sounds like living with your uncle is a better \"fit\" for him. It's not like you dropped him off with a school friend whom you hardly know!\n\nIt will take planning & effort to keep your little brother involved with his twin AND his other sibs, but I'm sure you and your uncle can do this. There is no abandonment here; it is people trying to make the best decision for these children!", "Your brother clearly needs individual attention right now. Your uncle can provide that. This is a great compromise for everyone. NTA. \n\nYour brother with six kids is not handling this correctly. His opinion can be noted and then ignored. \n\n>I am still feeling a lot of guilt for being someone else who is abandoning him and pawning of to another family member.\n\nYou are NOT abandoning him. It's not like you won't be in his life! He just has needs you can't currently meet and someone else in your family can meet them. He will see his twin every week, at minimum, your uncle lives 15 minutes away from you. You're going to take him on outings with everyone else. \n\nI do want to know why the kids are seeing your mother.", "YTA !!!!! \nYou had a long conversation about options with your uncle, mom, and the social worker but never thought to ask how he feels? This is horrible. A child should be involved (if they're able) in every decision that affects them!! Even if this was the right decision for everyone, you should have talked to him. Gotten his opinion. Included him in the conversations about HIS life!! \n\nHave y'all figured out how to make this a smooth transition? Have you asked him what he needs? Some things to think about: \nThis should be a long process \nWill he have to change schools? \nWill he still have access to his friends? \nWill he still be able to keep the same relationship with his therapist? \nWill he still be able to engage in the hobbies and activities he loves (ie boxing)?", "ooh gawd this is tricky.\n\nMy initial reaction is to say yes, because damnit this poor kid is getting bounced around but I realize that's an emotional reaction. \n\nAfter thinking it through, I am going to say yes, YTA.\n\nThis kid had a good time at his uncles house and was well behaved so 5 adults in his life decide to separate him from his twin sister? \n\nHim saying he doesn't mind/doesn't care is telling me he does care and doesn't want to go. He feels safe enough with you to display his emotions (anger) which he didn't at your uncles because that's not his safe place. He is looking for routine and stability and what he's getting is more abandonment.\n\nObviously, I am an internet judge and don't know this kid or you, but man, from a distance, this kid just wants someone to want him.\n\nESH here actually.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he is happy to live with his uncle and is settled this is a positive thing. Don\u2019t feel like you are giving up on him, because you aren\u2019t - reassure him that he is always welcome at your home, for sleepovers/movie nights/time with his sisters/cousins so you all will get that quality time together.", "NTA.  You're not abandoning him; you're placing him in an environment that he seems to thrive better in.  Your uncle appears to be able to communicate with your brother on a level he responds to better.  It's called looking out for the best interest of the child.", "He lives in the same town around 15 minutes from me. I already plan to have my brother visit weekly and they will still visit our mom together weekly. I'd still take my brother on any outings/activities I plan for my kids as well.", "No one even thought to ask the kid how he feels. Jeeze.", "NTA. This sounds like a thoughtful plan that does a good job of responding to what each kid needs. Keeping twins together is just one goal- finding the living situation that defuses his anger, reduces acting up in school and lets him focus on rebuilding is even better. Don't let your other brother talk you out of this- if 11 was struggling at your house can you imagine how he'd do in a house with 8 kids?? Sounds like living in a quieter home with an actively engaged uncle is working beautifully for him.", "In that case definitely NTA.\n\nBut it was mentioned elsewhere, the two of you should try to find out what it is that makes bonding for you two more difficult", "Apparently they did but he says he doesn\u2019t care either way"]}
