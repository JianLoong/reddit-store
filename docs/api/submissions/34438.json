He needs to explore why is he not able to bond with more people, see if he is truly interested in other people, decide what and how to improve himself and love himself the imperfect way he is.\n\nGood luck!", "I am sorry. I think your brother needs more help than you can give him. He has to be willing to accept help, no matter what. It sounds like your brother recognizes the feelings are one sided and is willing to pay. If this person becomes unavailable, that may be when your brother reaches out for help. NTA.", "Wait so he\u2019s been hiring an escort since he was 19? Hopefully this person is on the level. \n\nNAH. I see the concern but if he\u2019s a grown man I don\u2019t k is if you can do much besides throwing on your two cents. \n\nIf you don\u2019t mind answering, is he paying rent? Most of us at 22 don\u2019t have the money to hire an escort multiple times a week.\n\nEdit: I can\u2019t read, at first I thought it was 3x a week.", "NTA. He needs to hear it, in a loving and supportive way. Unfortunately intervention from only you probably won't change anything. People who are in one sided relationships like this rarely see it that way and almost need it to feel loved and supported. Without love or friendship from others to replace this relationship, he likely wont end it. It's really sad to see a loved one in this situation, sorry you're going through this. Is it possible to get him into, and to agree to therapy? Do you live in a place where you can help him get out there to make new friends and potential partners or are you in a more rural area?", "NTA\r  \nyou only told him the truth, but he refuses to accept it. It is very common for those who hire escorts to fall in love with someone and always ask for the same one. I hope your brother is well.", "NTA.", "NTA but a therapist might help get the message across over time more effectively. At this point, your brother is not open to finding a \"perfect\" loving man because he's literally buying a fantasy.", "NTA but your brother needs therapy", "I mean\u2026 NAH\n\nYour brother is forming a fictional relationship with a sex worker. Telling him may not help. But you can say not in my home.", "NTA he needs to understand that before he gets his heart broken", "Ummmm. It sounds like he needs to hear that this is about commerce - not romance.\n\nNAH. But, I actually think its fine for him to like who he likes and pay for company with the same person he's found comfort in. Only indulge yourself once by telling him the truth and then leave your adult brother alone. Its his life.", "NTA", "NAH. You're looking after your brother and worried about his future, nothing wrong with that. And all the things you said are valid too. However, they're only valid to an extent; there are people who are in deeply committed relationships that are still escorts, cam girls/boys, strippers, etc. It's entirely possible that the escort will grow to love him or already does, no idea. Only they know whats between them. And it doesn't seem like he's under any illusions at the moment: saying he already \"knows\" that he won't get a man like him implies he knows that this is \"the next best thing\" type of deal, and he's obviously already aware of the transactional relationship. At this point, you did what you needed to do, and it's up to him to decide if it's something he still wants. Even if the escort never loves him, nothing wrong with paying for companionship. I separate this from the above jobs to not seem insulting, but plenty of people also have and are content in a transactional sugar baby or trophy wife or gold digger type relationship. If it works for him, it's his life", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Maybe some questions/support to help him see what's up? Like if your brother can see the escort for free, or multiple times on split cost dates or being treated by the escort?\n\nIf he's hoping for the fantasy, maybe seeing it (not) play out and come to a head himself will help break the spell?", "This one makes me sad for your brother, I hope therapy does him well. Unfortunately, one day he will not have the extra $ or will add up all he has spent on said escort and deal with much heart break and shame", "NTA\n\nIIRC, in the book Mayflower Madam (true story about the business of running a high class escort service), there's a section discussing this from the hooker's POV. And, no, it wasn't love.", "Yes he\u2019s been in therapy for a while x", "Yes, since he was 19, according to him. \n\nHe is also paying rent. And unfortunately the majority of money that my brother has got left is spent on that escort with only minor amounts of money left for his necessities. So he virtually has no savings, which is also why I am extra worried for his future. \n\nMy brother usually sees him around every 2 to 4 weeks.", "Yes he\u2019s been in therapy for a while for other issues as well, idk to what extent it has helped him though. He does have 2 good friends, who he speaks too, but not very often I\u2019d say.", "Yeah that\u2019s what I don\u2019t want to happen :(", "Yeah I guess it\u2019s better to leave him alone, but I really want to do what I can to help him", "I hear what you are saying but I literally don\u2019t want him to hold onto a \u201cfalse\u201d pretence that the escort actually loves him like he does. Again, I\u2019m saying this but yeah you could be right since  I don\u2019t know what is exactly happening between them too.", "I got thinking and I don\u2019t think he pays the full price of seeing him as he sees him often-  if my calculations are correct then there must be something more to it - as in a discount that\u2019s offered to my brother for seeing the escort since I don\u2019t think my brother can afford the full price for what he provides twice a month", "OP could you possibly suggest a group Therapy session? It could be useful in a situation like this.", "Well you seem like a great sister. He is lucky to have you. Hopefully time and maturity help him heal. 19-22 is still so young. \n\nIf it helps, I know there were absolutely times when I was around that age that I got pissed at my older sister for offering advice. I got over it and now only get angry at her when she does not respond to my messages in a timely manner.", "With only 2 good friends who he doesn't speak to often I don't think he'll stop the relationship. I think it's an issue of loneliness. Which is very sad but there's not much you can do for him other than inviting him out, trying to get him to meet new people,  and just being loving and supportive (to him not the relationship with escort).  \nIs he openly gay or is that another barrier stopping him from getting into a new relationship?\n\nAgain I don't think there's much you can do other than being supportive of HIM. Unless this starts to bankrupt him and you need to get professional help before he ruins his life. \n\nIn case you're considering it. I also wouldn't try to contact the escort and ask them to stop, that's a dangerous game that could blow up in your face in an irreparable way.", "I can see that. And I support it. I just hope it doesn't backfire because you're misinterpreted and he feels like you want to tell him how to live his life. (My own siblings are hyper touchy about that. You may not have the same problem though. Good luck.)", "I don\u2019t think he will agree to do that but I will definitely try for it", "Thank you x \nHe\u2019s the only immediate family I have got, our mum passed away when he was 16 and our dad is not in the picture. So I\u2019m always extra worried about him.", "I think it\u2019s because of his anxiety and issues with body confidence as he unfortunately doesn\u2019t see himself as \u201cattractive\u201d and thinks that no one will want him, which is not true. \nThough I\u2019m worried about his savings, he knows when he can afford to meet the escort like I don\u2019t think he would spend all of his money but yeah it\u2019s still worrying", "your brother and by proxy you, are in for a very rough time when the money runs out and the escort is no longer in the picture. \n\nsucks, but that may be the thing that makes it sink in. \n\nany chance your brother would entertain a joint therapy session where you can both talk about the inevitable? maybe make a plan to deal with his upcoming heartbreak? i suspect it'll be very traumatic when it happens.", "I don\u2019t think he will agree to do the group therapy session but I will definitely try for it happen"]}
