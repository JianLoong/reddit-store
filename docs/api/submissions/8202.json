You will just set yourself up for disappointment.", "NTA but is there a possibility they may be having some financial difficulties they don\u2019t want to mention to you?", "NTA. But I\u2019d advise taking a different approach about the future. I experienced family expecting demanding gifts for years when I struggled to afford it, but then always go cheap on my gifts. It caused a lot of resentment in me. Eventually I decided I was over it and not playing games anymore. It makes life so much better to pull out of a toxic pattern. \n\nAs much fun as a lot of these suggestions are, I\u2019d drop the topic for now. Say nothing and don\u2019t be drawn about it if they ask. Then next fall have dinner with your parents and drop the news that you recognize you are now an adult and really don\u2019t need/want gifts from them. \n\nPoint out it\u2019s the thought that counts\u2026and you\u2019ll be keeping your gifts for them economical and small.

You\u2019re just letting them know, as an adult, you\u2019re not going to play those games. Then follow through! \n\nEscaping from these ridiculous, no win scenarios are the greatest gift you can give yourself. (Oh, and spend that money you would have spent on them\u2026on yourself!!)\n\n**final point: Your brother and you have a separate relationship from the relationship with your parents. You are adults and can exchange gifts or not. Just don\u2019t do it in front of your parents.", "NTA- Next year buy some new pots and pan for yourself for Christmas.

It feels like you're not really upset by the fact they didn't get you a gift, but by their lack of consideration of your feelings.\n\nIf they simply didn't want to exchange gifts this year they had ample time to tell the family instead of weird promisary notes of gifts that may or may not arrive later because it prolongs the whole experience, making it an awkward and hurtful reminder.
