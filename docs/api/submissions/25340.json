My son(4m) also lives with us. Rent is $2700 and when we first signed the lease I offered to pay an extra $200 on top of my $900 a month since we have an extra room for my son. They said \u201cno you don\u2019t have to do that, your son is like family\u201d. \n\nA month after we moved in Aria met her girlfriend Alex (28f). After about 3 months of them dating, Aria stopped coming home, she would be at Alex\u2019s house. She would literally only come to get clothe or her other items. At first Aria was still paying rent but after 2 months of \u201cliving\u201d with Alex she completely stopped without notice. My other roommate and I had to split it rent in half. The second month of non payment I told her either get all your shit out the room so we can find another roommate or come back and pay rent. \n\nShe eventually comes back but the issue is Alex was there ALL THE TIME and eventually she moved in completely without asking us. I already didn\u2019t like Alex because she was the one encouraging her to do all this bs like not paying rent and stuff in the first place. I hated coming home and I always felt uncomfortable. I eventually told Aria, Alex has to start putting some money towards the rent and they didn\u2019t agree. They said if your son can be here and have a whole room, she can live there for free. I told her I offered to pay, they\u2019re the one that declined and if she wants, she can take my sons room and we all split. My son is with his father 50% of the time so I don\u2019t mind him sharing a room with me. My other roommate is completely not backing me because she\u2019s so non confrontational and that is HER best friend.

You/Your son and Ari/Alex both pay for 1.5 people and Emily pays for 1 person. \n\nYou/Your son- $1,012.5 a month \n\nAri/Alex- $1,012.5 a month \n\nEmily- $675 a month\n\nHonestly though, this is an overall worse situation for you.

Second, your child is exactly that: a CHILD. They should not have to pay rent. You additionally offered to give up his room since he is \"rent free.\"\nBut an adult should not be expecting to live somewhere for free with people who are not family. I would expect any friend who lives in my house for an extended period of time to pay their share of rent and utilities. \n\nI would give them a hard out date.

I would have said yes if you had said you didn\u2019t believe you should pay more for your son, but you offered and it was rejected. \n\nIn general rent for a space should be divided by bedroom, so I get in a way why Aria doesn\u2019t think she should have to pay more, she doesn\u2019t believe she is taking up more space. The thing is while rent should be split by bedroom, utilities and other expenses are a per person basis. Also you can never move someone in with out approval from everyone living there.\n\nTruly the best thing you can do is move out. Seems like you can afford to, so it is not a money issue, which is the only reason I could see staying. A revolving cast of characters coming and going without you having any say, which this situation highlights you would not, would be more disruptive for you son then this one time change. \n\nI get you are worried about your cousin, but she is an adult.  I would just let her know that if things in the long run do not work out with Aria and her GF you would be willing to be roommates with just her at the end of her current lease (that is if you are).

Sometimes people won't stand up for themselves and that's very frustrating, but you're not her keeper. And as an adult, she needs to learn how to be confrontational if people are putting her in a bad position. If what's best for you is for you and your son to move instead of living in a tense situation, that's what you need to do. \n\nI'm saying this as someone who was in a similar situation at a workplace. I didn't want to leave because my friend, who was also being treated badly, didn't want to leave. It took months before I reached my breaking point and got out of there, and it wasn't worth it.
