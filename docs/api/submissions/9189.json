He refuses to take his medicine anymore and lives on mayonnaise sandwiches despite them being relatively well-off.           \n\nYesterday my grandfather had to go to the hospital for major chest pains, but he got angry and left. Today he went back up there for the same reason, and after a few hours the head nurse gave me a call asking his \"mental baseline\", describing him as yelling shouting and running up and down the halls. The staff eventually made my grandmother leave the premises (they were fussing and she seemed to be antagonizing him). \n\nThey are both declining in health rather fast; my grandmother mentally and my grandfather physically. \n\nI've tried in the past to get an in-home nurse, but my grandmother claims they are stealing from her (she's always believed home nurses do that, it's not a new issue from the stroke or age) or she doesn't like them because they are \"ethnic\" (she uses worse terms). Oddly, she really wants to go to a nursing home.          \n\nI can pay for in home nurses and caretakers for several years with my current salary and savings, but my grandmother doesn't want that. They both want me to move back to SC and live with them as their caretaker instead. I miss my childhood home, but I'm certainly not qualified as a caretaker.

There's no industries nearby where they live that I have skills in.

You have given them options and they are refusing to accept any option except you moving back home. This is incredibly selfish. Your grandparents or any relative should want you to thrive and not want to be a burden on you. You would be giving up your own independence, possibly your career (if you can't wfh) and mental wellbeing for them. They are willing to give up nothing. As cruel as it sounds, sometimes family is the last group of people qualified to make decisions because to us it's personal. My client actually ended up giving guardianship to the government so there is a trustee that makes all legal decisions pertaining to my client's father. They still have a wonderful relationship despite his father's declining health and their relationship isn't burdened with the legalities and guilt of him having to be responsible for his father. He didn't wash his hands of him, he just knew that he didn't have the time or mental capacity to do things that wouldn't harm himself and his own well being. We have been wrongly conditioned to sacrifice ourselves for people in the sake of family, and we really ought to not feel guilty or like an AH for also needing to take care of ourselves. What good would you be if you also weren't doing well? \n\nOffer them homecare or assisted living or find government options.

No one pressured me. I am a firm believer in just because you are family doesn\u2019t mean you are required to care for them. If they refuse in home nursing, then put them in an assisted living facility. If it would make them happy agree to visit x amount of times per year. Or you could consider moving them to a facility near you, so you can visit but not do the actual caretaking. Do not feel bad about not moving in with them.
