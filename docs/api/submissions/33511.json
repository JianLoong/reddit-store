Neither my mom or my stepdad had warned me he was coming, so I didn't know. I asked him about the name of the people who had hired him, and he didn't know. I called my stepdad and my mom and they didn't pick up. I didn't know what to do, so I didn't let him in. \n\nMy mom and stepdad got home and I explained the situation. My mom said she understood it, but my stepdad got very mad because they will have to pay a fee to reschedule it. \n\nI have had some bad experiences that I think make me a bit more afraid than I should be in a lot of situations, and I think this may be one of them.

He could\u2019ve called his boss right then and there and found out, if need be. He chose not to. \n\nIt\u2019s your parents\u2019 fault that they forgot to tell you. This is a them problem and not a you problem.", "NTA\n\nThe worker should have known the name of the person that he was working for & your family should have told you that he was coming first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT*****: The worker shouldn't charge a cancellation fee b/c he couldn't even provide the person of the person who hired him.***", "NTA, anyone could notice you're having work done and try to be deceptive to get in and cause trouble of some sort. It was well within their abilities to let you know who's coming for the day so you can be prepared to let them in.", "NTA. You did the right thing. Safety above all else. There were plenty of opportunities to make this situation work:\n\n1. Step-dad could schedule work for a time when he's home\n2. Worker could have identified himself and his employer, followed by you making a couple of phone calls to confirm it's legit.\n3. Step-dad could have told you a worker was coming.\n4. Step-dad or mom could have been reachable by phone.\n\nYou are not the cause of the breakdown here. They all failed you. Step-dad needs to get a clue.", "NTA. You made the right decision to prioritize your safety. \n\nIt doesn't surprise me that your mom understood but your step-dad didn't. In general, men can't relate to or understand how scary it is to be a woman, ESPECIALLY a young woman.", "NTA\n\nStepdad is probably mad at himself for overlooking the detail of telling you.  He's taking it out on you because you were the one to deny entry, but what if you hadn't been home at all?    I have a friend whose street was under construction.  A man put on a safety vest and knocked on her door, her daughter was home alone and she let him in.  Not going to finish the story, but you get it.  Show this to your stepdad.", "NTA.  He couldn't even provide basic info.  For your own safety, you did the right thing", "NTA\n\nAsk your stepdad if your safety is worth more than a callout fee.", "NTA...Your parents should be praising you for guarding your safety.  They should also have told you exactly who would be dropping by. It's a crazy world out there, so keep taking care of yourself.", "Nah girl u did good. ppl who would get mad at you for not letting him in would blame u if had, and something happened", "NTA. Maybe point out to your stepfather that he can pay the rescheduling fee but he can't pay to undo any harm a malicious stranger could have done to you.\n\nIf that doesn't register, also point out that this random stranger could've damaged the house, and that would cost stepfather even more money to fix. I'm sorry he kind of sucks and he strikes me as the type to take a threat to his property more seriously than a threat to his stepchild.", "NTA. Never under any circumstances should you let an unknown and unexpected stranger into your home without verifying who they are.  Even more important as a young female in the house alone. In your position, I'd have done the exact same thing. Maybe if he had said, \"Yeah, the work was ordered by Mr. Stepdad's Name, phone number 555-xxxx,\" I'd have let him in, but he couldn't even tell you that.\n\nYou're absolutely right that this could have been avoided by your stepdad telling you that someone named Joe or Jack or whatever, or someone from XYZ Company may be coming by to work on the house. The rescheduling fee is the price he gets to pay for failing to communicate.", "NTA. So many people pretend to be construction workers, utility workers, anyone in uniform, etc. to gain access to places and harm people. \n\nYou were a young woman home alone and you did what you needed to do to protect yourself. I'm a grown woman and get a little sketched out when I have to let strangers into my home. I watch too many crime shows. \n\nYour SD can be annoyed and keep it to his damn self.", "NTA. This is common sense, especially for a young person alone in a house. If your SD didn\u2019t want to pay the rescheduling fee, he should have warned you the contractor was coming by. Nonetheless, it\u2019s telling that the woman is understanding and the man isn\u2019t.", "NTA - great job!!! That's the best possible thing you could have done. Brilliant work.\n\n Remind your stepdad it's his fault he has to pay a fee, as he neither was home himself or warned you.", "OP there is no way you should be blamed but SD.  He should have let you know that they were coming to work on the place. Also, the worker should have been able to provide information to you. This is a NTA at all. Good job for keeping yourself safe.", "NTA - you did the right thing.", "NTA. You should never put your safety at risk over something like this.", "Yes, they should have warned and gotten a name to identify him. NTA. Fee is on them for not telling you in advance.", "NTA.

Stepdad only has himself to blame, just like if you hadn't even been home since you weren't expecting anyone.", "Absolutely NTA! Women get murdered and assaulted in their own homes, with enraging and depressing regularity. You did the smart, responsible thing. Step dad needs to pay more attention to what's going on in his home. It should be his responsibility to communicate about those things.", "Read The Gift of Fear.  He could have been someone who saw construction going on and decided to use it as a way to gain access.  Screw your stepdad.  He's male.  He doesn't get it.  Most men don't.  If he didn't give you the information and protect your safety, the fee is on him.  NTA", "NTA. I was in a similar situation when I was 13 and home alone sick. The guy went nuts trying to open our door and eventually jumped the fence into the backyard. I ended up calling the cops and hiding in the bathroom with a knife in my hand. Turns out he was there to do some work, but NO ONE told me.", "NTA... this was a wise decision. Your parents lack of communication is what caused the inconvenience but you showed wisdom in your stance.", "Never apologize for protecting yourself. You 100% did the right thing.

My very first instinct in such a situation as a dad (my daughter is also 18) is to make sure my daughter is safe and reassure her she did the right thing. Chastising you means he cares about the money he lost over and above your potential safety and well being.", "You did the right thing f18yo unknown dude hell no, your stepdad is a nut job if he values the nickles and dimes he looses for rescheduling over your safety.", "NTA oh heck no. I never answer the door if I see a stranger. If I notice it\u2019s someone delivering something I open the small window in our kitchen (which is right next to the front door) and speak through it. The only exception for this is very close people I know and am expecting to come over. My neighbor who I have lived next to for 12 years I won\u2019t even open the door for him, he will sometimes come to the door if he needs a favor (usually just asking me to move my car or if he can borrow something).  But I\u2019m not scared of my neighbor I just got used to going to the window so I still do and he doesn\u2019t care at all, sometimes he just knocks on the window knowing I\u2019ll come to it lol \nTrust your gut never let anyone in if you\u2019re not comfortable. And if your stepdad knew someone might stop by he should have told you, the fee he has to pay is all on him.", "Pretending to be a construction worker on a house that has been seen with construction going on is a known scam. \n\nIf you google the faces of serial killers, they all look like normal people.\n\nThe dad was wrong, and he should encourage her to continue acting cautiously.", "Nta: if your stepdad can\u2019t get it through his head then make him watch the first home alone movie over and over until he gets the point", "NTA- he didn't know who hired him to work at the house.
