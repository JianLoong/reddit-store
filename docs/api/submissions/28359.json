My family is starting to get very upset with what they deem disrespect at this point. My father keeps threatening to invite over my ex who knew how to work hard. It\u2019s becoming a lot to juggle the changes and the pushback Greg is causing on top of it all. \n\nTo try and get some leeway on not doing work around the farm Greg got a job at a very corporate fast food place in the meantime until he gets an offer in his field.

I\u2019m wondering if this is a lifestyle difference between you two that you are motivated and hard working and he just isn\u2019t?", "NTA. He is far too young to start this crap. He has to do exercises to strengthen his core to get through whatever IS actually bothering him\u2014if it's not just in his head. My brother broke five ribs two years ago flipping his dirt bike in the desert. He was able to play tennis and bicycle everywhere, do normal lifting, lift weights, inside a year from that, and he is 68 years old. If your boyfriend is like this now, he's gonna be in a wheel chair by the time he's fifty, with self-imposed disabilities he could avoid simply by getting off his ass right now. I have a friend who made her husband's condition a condition for staying with him, because he was driving her crazy, complaining about back pain while doing NOTHING to mitigate it. She is a small person and he is 6 ft with little muscle because he is so sedentary, she was literally doing the heavy lifting while he'd complain if he had to walk to the mailbox. She got him to start physical therapy, which included a doctor's workup, so he'd know which exercises to start with to strengthen his core, and she also told him he has to stop complaining. She cannot wake up to that every flipping day. He's got a plan mapped out now, and is doing well. Nothing he's been advised to do is rocket science\u2014it's basically use it or lose it advice, with attention to strengthening.", "NTA, I don't blame you for feeling done with this but I wonder about a few things...\n\n1. Has he sought recent medical help of any kind for what appears to be chronic pain after his injury?\n2. You mentioned he almost didn't go to 'his second shift' - do you mean his second shift **that da**y or are you referring to the second shift of a job that involves starting in the afternoon or evening? \n3. If he nopes out of the particular tasks you've been asked to do at the farm, is he contributing in other ways to the household? \n4. The fact that you have a high pain tolerance and a genetic issue that causes you pain does not in and of itself make it reasonable for someone else to just get on with life if they are facing chronic pain. But, he might also be faking it at this point.", "He\u2019s absolutely milking it, and by the sounds looking for a meal ticket (you) and to see how far it can go. I\u2019d be worried about getting pregnant to a guy like that. \n\nTell him to move out and you need some space - or get your parents to kick him out!", "NTA\n\nKick him to the curb, he's not going to change and you owe it to yourself to have a partner who will actually be a partner.", "NTA but girl. He needs to get gone. I don't have patience with malingerers.", "NTA.  Unless he can provide medical proof of his irretractable pain he needs to get his shit together or get out.  Don\u2019t put yourself through this any longer.  This is one time to listen to your family.  They can see he\u2019s being a lazy mooch.", ">He will tell me one day \u201cI can\u2019t text you because of my rib, using my phone really hurts me.\u201d Then he\u2019s watching YouTube shorts all day on it. I\u2019d be so understanding if he had a doctors appointment and was working with a health person on this issue\n\nAnd he turned down free medical!?!\n\nNTA\n\n\n\nHe's faking it. You need to break up with him and kick him out.  Frankly you need to just pack up his stuff and drop it off at his job or his parents house and let him know it's over after. Otherwise he won't ever leave your home. ( Don't come at me about tenancy rights --his transgressions go beyond that...and OPs Dad isn't playing around).", "NTA. Kick him out.", "NTA\n\nHurt my shoulder back in late March, doing something *stupid.*  Reached my arm back behind the car seat, palm up (so already a very bad angle for the arm to be at) to drop my backpack back there.  As the bag came over the seat, it dropped down and wrenched my shoulder.  There's a muscle on the front of the shoulder which *really* doesn't like that crap.\n\nAn injury like that should take ~6 weeks to heal, if you're treating it right, keeping it mobile and such.  But I have a medical condition which complicates things (Tourette's is *fun* with injuries!), and I minorly reinjured 2 or 3 times, setting things back.  So it took about twice that.  Even though I wasn't too surprised by it taking longer to heal, I *still* hit a point where if it had gone on much longer, I'd have sucked it up and sought evaluation to see if there was actually something more or more severe going on.  We're talking 3-4 months.\n\nA *year* and refusing medical evaluation?  Take a step back and look at how ridiculous that really is.\n\nYou say in comments that he's refused even when he can be seen for free!  If he was really still in pain from this a *year* later, then something's very wrong and he should be jumping at the (FREE) opportunity to have that looked at and see if anything can be done. If nothing else even just to get an explanation.\n\nBut he's refusing this.\n\nAnd it's okay for you to work and do everything through your pain, but his is apparently so much worse that it's not okay for him to?  And he's in *that* much pain and still refusing *free* evaluation?  Again, take a breath and a step back and see how ridiculous this picture is.\n\nReally it's the refusal of medical evaluation that's the big \"wait, hold up\" element here.\n\nHe's using you, and has been for at least half your relationship.  What the hell are *you* even getting out of this relationship?  Because it's clear that he's getting a ton from it.", "INFO - how do you know he's faking it and it's not a chronic pain issue? Has he been to a doc lately? \n\nOverall I would say NTA because even if it is chronic pain he should be getting help for it. Doesn't mean he can do the stuff you want him to do but he should get that checked out if it's legit", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was also diagnosed by a doctor, so.\n\nThis is on him to manage. Pain is now part of his life. The calculus he needs to make is not \u201cwill this hurt\u201d but \u201cwill this activity injure me? Will this impact my mobility?\u201d If it\u2019s just gonna hurt?

Cooking, cleaning, even being an assistant like setting up the wood to chop or putting it away 1-2 logs at a time. \n\nIt\u2019s also on him to manage his pain. Whether that\u2019s PT, anti-inflammatories, hot packs, ice packs, massage, brace, etc. He needs to figure out what times of day he\u2019s most functional and plan accordingly. \n\nIf he hasn\u2019t yet, it\u2019s on him to pursue a diagnosis/treatment. He needs X-rays, MRI, CT, and probably needs to talk to an orthopedic specialist and/or sports medicine specialist.

Can't play video games because of how painful holding the controller/using the keyboard is?\n\nIf his rib pain is real, which it likely isn't, and is so debilitating he can't contribute then it should be heavily interfering with the rest of his life too.\n\nI tore the muscle or separated the muscle from my left ribs a few years ago.

I still went to work, did my labor intensive job, and lived life.\n\nSo is his whole life impacted by his injury, or just the stuff he doesn't want to do? \"Need to be rested in case I get a better job\" the second day of his current job is very telling.
