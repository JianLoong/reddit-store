Seems a little narcissistic to me", "NTA - if she had asked can she get one too after you guys get yours as a show of support then I think you'd be wrong for refusing that.

She might be stealing limelight, or she may be so thrilled with her lovely granddaughter that she wanted to show her support too. I don\u2019t know her and won\u2019t judge. That being said find your tattoo artist of choice and work with them too make your tattoos more personal for you and less like your MIL. A good artist can do great things with pattern and color to make something look different but have the same meaning.", "NTA, while what others say about you not owning a design or rights on a tattoo is true, it\u2019s clear your MIL lacks boundaries and social awareness. Stealing gift ideas and inserting herself into situations where she isn\u2019t needed or wanted is poor form. You and your partner need to discuss boundaries with her.

While it's great that she wants to show her love for her granddaughter, it seems she didn't consider how her actions would affect you and Aidan. It would have been more appropriate for her to ask for your input or get a different design to avoid taking away from the special meaning behind your planned tattoos.", "NTA.\n\n Considering the families-- and therefore presumably the in-laws-- were originally wanting you to terminate the pregnancy, and continue making rude remarks about your daughter, I would be irritated that your MIL decided to not only out of nowhere get a tattoo to \"show her support\", but also get involved in a couple's tattoo.
