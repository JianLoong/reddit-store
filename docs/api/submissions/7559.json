{"id": 7559, "submission_id": "10e3vna", "title": "AITA for not throwing my daughter an extravagant birthday party?", "selftext": "My daughter Anna (16f) and I (45f) have very different personalities - I'm an introvert whose idea of a perfect night is curling up with a good book, and she's an extrovert who prefers going out with friends. She's also grown up far more privileged than I was - I grew up in a cramped apartment in a poor immigrant neighborhood, while Anna and her sister (13f) have their own rooms, computers and cell phones. (This seems to be the norm where we live, but it's a big culture shock for me.) Our relationship has always been challenging due to our different personalities and upbringings, but things seem to have gotten much more difficult since Anna became a teenager. We fight a lot, and though I of course love her, I often find her to be very demanding & entitled.\n\nLast year, Anna said that she wanted a big party for her \"sweet sixteen.\" When I asked what she had in mind, she said she wanted something like the parties that her friends had for their bat mitzvahs. Even knowing how extroverted she is, I was STUNNED that Anna would ask for such an extravagant event, which there's no way we could afford - after all, those kinds of parties cost tens of thousands of dollars! Of course, I shut it down immediately. This made her very angry, and we had a huge argument. I just literally could not believe that she would ask for something so frivolous as an expensive party that only lasts a couple hours.\n\nFor weeks, Anna kept begging me to have a sweet sixteen, insisting it was important to her to have a big party with all her friends for a \"milestone birthday.\" I got so tired of arguing about it that I finally relented and agreed to it - however, I explained that it was going to be on a budget. She said she understood and agreed.\n\nI was able to find a venue (the local clubhouse), a DJ, and went with Chipotle for catering, all of which she OK'd. (I managed the process so that we would not go over budget.) I was able to put it all together for around $1500.\n\nWell, I guess I should have predicted this, but although Anna agreed that the party would be done on a budget, apparently it wasn't good enough for her. When we entered the venue on the day of her party, it was clear that she was disappointed. The party itself seemed to go fine.\n\nAt the end of the night, we drove home in silence, and I could tell she was upset. When we got home, Anna stormed off to her room without even so much as a \"thank you.\"\n\nThe next morning, Anna laid into me, saying that her \"cheap ass party\" left her feeling humiliated in front of all her friends. I reminded her that she agreed to my conditions, and she said she never would have done so if she knew I was going to \"cheap out so bad.\" I told her she should be grateful she even had a sweet sixteen party, something I never would have dreamed to ask my parents for.\n\nIt's been a week and Anna has barely spoken to me. I think she's being very entitled and my husband agrees with me, but my other daughter says she understands where Anna is coming from.

Of course she\u2019s upset, her party sucked and she was embarrassed in front of her friends.\n\nYou made the barest minimum of efforts to give your daughter what she had asked for, to the point where she would have been better off if you had just said \u201cno\u201d and gotten her to pick something else. Like, weaponized incompetence levels of effort.", "YTA based on your comments. You couldnt get a few decorations for the venue? And the DJ didnt even play music but instead did trivia.

Instead you showed her how little you cared and embarassed her in front of her friends.", "INFO:  any additional specifics on what elements Anna found cheap?  You said she approved the venue, DJ, and food.  Was it the quantity of food?  Lack of decorations?  I feel like something is missing.\n\nEdited to add:  YTA.  It sounds like you didn\u2019t even try.  Why did you not ask the venue about decorations or tablecloth?  Why did you not ask the DJ about his routine?  Trivia is very different from music.  You also go out of your way to elaborate about how entitled your daughter is without providing these crucial details.  \n\nThis was probably really humiliating for her and it may have been better for all not to have had a party at all.", "YTA. You tried but you didn't really try.", "Here\u2019s the thing: my mom raised 4 kids on a teacher\u2019s salary. Our birthday parties were AWESOME! She put together themes for them, did great decorations, made sure it was special. It\u2019s not about the money. She put in the time and effort. You could have gotten some balloons, some streamers. A fucking tablecloth. You should have done that. YTA. Try to find a way to make it up to her.", "YTA \nYou should have better communicated details with your daughter so she had realistic expectations.  Imagine how much better everything could have gone if you actively involved her in the planning and had a real sense of what she was hoping for.   It\u2019s quite likely that she assumed you were putting together an actual party as opposed to Chipotle dinner in a dark clubhouse.   Sure she okayed it all, but probably assumed there was more to it than those three components and that you were taking care of it. You\u2019re the adult.  You failed to communicate.", "The way this post was written I actually forgot you were her bio mother and raised her. I assumed you were her step mother who has only been in her life for a few years.\n\nIt\u2019s strange that you\u2019re shocked at her upbringing\u2026considering you\u2019re the one who brought her up. My mum was an immigrant and we are POLAR opposites but she made the effort to just understand me and not judge me for that. And I did the same. My mum worked really hard to build a life for me and my siblings but she doesn\u2019t hold it over our heads because we had a better upbringing.\n\nShe\u2019s 16. What 16 year old isn\u2019t entitled or demanding these days. And sweet 16s have this massive pressure these days, especially with social media, for being extravagant. While I commend you for trying, it seems like you didn\u2019t understand how much it meant to her enough to go out of your way. We get a few milestone birthdays in our lives, a little extra effort isn\u2019t gonna kill you. You said that the DJ barely played any music or that you didn\u2019t have any table cloths. Just because this isn\u2019t a big deal for you, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a big deal to her. You guys really need to work on communicating better. She\u2019s 15 if you don\u2019t start getting to a common ground, when she moves out in a few years, it may be too late", "YTA. Just because you're an introvert doesn't mean your daughter has to hide away too. How could you downplay her sweet 16?", "YTA..... There's no need to throw a something super expensive and extravagant. However, putting some actual effort in IS required. It sounds like you hired the first/cheapest DJ you could find and you didn't even decorate. A Sweet 16 is considered a milestone in the U.S. just like a Quinceanera for Hispanic cultures. Just because some of us choose not to have them, doesn't mean they're not important.", "YTA. It seems like you cared more about teaching Anna a lesson than throwing her a birthday party. You should have spent the $1500 where it would be the most meaningful. That means food, decorations\u2014stuff to make it feel like a party. Walmart has aisles and aisles of cheap party decorations, a lot of them even say \u201cSweet 16.\u201d Spotify, Pandora, iTunes could have functioned instead of a DJ. Maybe you could have even done the party outside at home instead of booking a venue. \n\nNext time, budget better so your daughter doesn\u2019t walk into an empty room and think, \u201cWhere\u2019s my party?\u201d", "INFO\n\nBased on the raw words/content of this post, it *sounds* like you were in the right. **But** there's a lot of assertions/accusations thrown towards her as to intent. Where gut instinct? I'm suspecting this is likely a symptom of a much deeper issue, I felt very defensive just on her behalf reading this with all the \"privileged\", \"demanding\" and \"entitled\" statements being thrown at her.\n\nSo I can't help but think at least a piece of this may be built from defensiveness/tension over time. And being perfectly honest, in a child-parent dynamic, when there's a tension or defensiveness going on. It usually can be traced back to something the parent did to make the child feel unloved, conditionally loved, judged or unwanted.\n\nOnce again, INFO, so none of this is concrete. This is just the general impression I'm getting based on the tone and word choice of this post. I don't think she acted properly in this situation mind you, this isn't a defense for her actions. But if my gut reading this post is correct, it would explain how it got so bad.", "YTA. You wasted money not her.  You chose to spend $1500 on a crappy birthday party.  You should have had decorations and music, not trivia.\n\n\n\nI get you grea up poor, so did my parents.  and it seems like you want your kids to feel the same.  Most people want their kids to have better and easier lives - do you? \n\n\nSince you aren\u2019t used to doing this sort of thing, you should have asked a fellow parent - who is good - for help. You don\u2019t need to spend thousands of dollars for a fun time. Why didn\u2019t you? \n\n\nI hope you will apologize to\nYour daughter, offer to spend another $1000 and work with another parent to redo this.", "YTA.\n\nYou're falling into the 'I don't value X, therefore X has no value, and anybody who does value X is objectively wrong' fallacy.\n\nYou also seem to be straight-up jealous of her. Your job as parent is to give her a better life than you had, not to resent her for it.\n\nYour daughter seems quite entitled if she's expecting a five figure party.  But where did she get that entitled attitude from?\n\nLike, I wouldn't throw a five figure party either, because I don't have the money to.  But I wouldn't judge somebody merely for wanting one.  Hell, if I had the money, I, an introverted hermit, would absolutely throw one for myself, and I would sit up on a raised dais, and I would silently toast people, and I would preside as king for a day.  There would be a velvet rope, and there would be large gentlemen wearing tuxedos and sunglasses manning that rope, and I would let it be known to all invited that I would be having great fun giving indolent waves or imperious but slight headshakes at my whim.  I would ask them all to show up dressed in their gaudiest, most horrible 'we're all pretending to be international jet setters but we're really not' outfits.  It would be a blast.\n\nBut that's just me.", "YTA \n\nWas about to go with NTA until I discovered you put no effort whatsoever into the party, I would be disappointed in you, you could have bought some decorations and tablecloth \n\nIntrovert or not, not cool mom, you didn\u2019t care at all for making the party fun for her", "YTA. She\u2019s not upset with you because you \u201ccheaped out.\u201d She\u2019s upset with you because you didn\u2019t care at all about something that was important to her. Within that budget, you could absolutely have made it special, even magical, but it sounds like it was a very sad affair.", "YTA. This can probably be classified as \u201cmalicious compliance\u201d. You seem to resent your daughter for having or wanting more than you had growing up.", "YTA.\n\nYou didn't care. You just went and hired the bare minimum and never did research about it. It's not about the money, nobody is enttled to a party, but if you choose to throw one you must be a part of the organization.\n\nYou signed a contract for the venue and never read about tablecloth?, never asked?\n\nYou hired a DJ but you didn't know what music he played -he played none- and it seemed right.\n\nYou failed your daughter, you just wanted to made a lesson out of a milestone birthday. Heck, it even seems like you were somehow taking revenge against the extrovert kids by ruining the party.", "YTA\n\nHaving a strict budget is good and understandable, but not bothering to have decorations or making sure the DJ would actually play music??? Of course, she is humiliated.", "You are the one that raised her that way.

I encourage you to look deeper as to why you resent your own outgoing child just because she isn\u2019t like you.", "YTA. I have read your comments. There is no way you could have been this obtuse. You purposefully tanked the party, probably so she would never ask anything of you again and to teach her a lesson.", "YTA. the normal and healthy feeling of a parent towards a child is to want them to have a better childhood in every way than the parent had.\n\nYour entire post screams that you antagonize your daughter for her having a better childhood than you did.\n\nYou experienced shortcomings in your childhood and now you want to reflect that in her and in her life at every opportunity. That is an unhealthy envy and a constant punishment that you do to her not only for what I pointed out above, but for her being her own person and not being like you.\n\nYou are going to deny it until the end here, to her and to everyone without rest, because arrogant people are like that, they live in denial, but deep inside you know that you did it so that she would \"learn\" according to your parameters and shame her to teach her not ask you for anything more, that costs you money that you see as an unnecessary expense, and to no longer have the extroversion that you lack.\n\nIrrational punishment for envy and bitterness.\nIt's a terrible thing, I'm telling you very honestly, go to therapy and cure that. Because that behavior of yours is going to escalate and you are going to project it into all your interactions with your daughter until she decides that she can no longer deal with you and your bitterness.\n\nAnd just so you understand, teaching your children to be humble is not the same as not giving them anything. Throwing them a birthday party or giving them comforts is not teaching them to be arrogant. It is taking care of them and showing them love through normal and healthy gestures and at the same time building a way of communication with them where the differences between being humble and being arrogant are explained.\n\nShe is the teenager and you are the adult who is reflecting her own bitterness on her. Clearly the one who is failing is you. \n\nIn the future, when you are older and you are going to need some medical input, some professional care or some comfort item and she tells you that it is an unnecessary expense and denies it, do not complain, because you taught her to be like that.", "ESH. \n\n1) personality differences are not an excuse for throwing a party. Your budget concern *was* but the idea that you just didn\u2019t want to because you\u2019re an introvert is ridiculous. Plan the party. Sit in a corner and watch your daughter be happy. \n\n2) I agree that *children* don\u2019t understand that things cost money and for the level of extravagance your daughter wanted, wasn\u2019t something you could match. There were opportunities for you to convey that message to her and it sounds like you didn\u2019t. You could have done without a DJ, have your daughter create a playlist of music she would like. Do without a catered meal and focus on providing a nice cake/dessert. By saving that money you could have had more decorations to be \u201cextravagant\u201d\n\n3) I saw your comment about not being open with family finances because it\u2019s not a kids job to know, that\u2019s great and I agree to an extent. If you\u2019re showing Anna that you have limitless funds and she has this fabricated idea that you\u2019re rich and doesn\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t afford a birthday party for her, then maybe you should be more transparent on family funds so she can *understand* why you were unable to reach her extravagance level.

Just because you had less growing up doesn\u2019t mean your kids should too. Times are changing, you need to keep up, not the other way around. You know teens are impressionable.

But I also don\u2019t think she has any idea what things actually cost. She should have been more involved in the planning process. She should have been shown how much your options cost, and been able to make decisions about what is more important to have. It sounds like you guys had no real communication about what she expected.  You just made the arrangements and asked her afterwards if it was ok - without her realizing that you were only planning the bare necessities. Has she ever planned a party before?

She's also grown up far more privileged than I was - I grew up in a cramped apartment in a poor immigrant neighborhood, while Anna and her sister (13f) have their own rooms, computers and cell phones. (This seems to be the norm where we live, but it's a big culture shock for me.) Our relationship has always been challenging due to our different personalities and upbringings, but things seem to have gotten much more difficult since Anna became a teenager. We fight a lot, and though I of course love her, I often find her to be very demanding & entitled.\n\nLast year, Anna said that she wanted a big party for her \"sweet sixteen.\" When I asked what she had in mind, she said she wanted something like the parties that her friends had for their bat mitzvahs. Even knowing how extroverted she is, I was STUNNED that Anna would ask for such an extravagant event, which there's no way we could afford - after all, those kinds of parties cost tens of thousands of dollars! Of course, I shut it down immediately. This made her very angry, and we had a huge argument. I just literally could not believe that she would ask for something so frivolous as an expensive party that only lasts a couple hours.\n\nFor weeks, Anna kept begging me to have a sweet sixteen, insisting it was important to her to have a big party with all her friends for a \"milestone birthday.\" I got so tired of arguing about it that I finally relented and agreed to it - however, I explained that it was going to be on a budget. She said she understood and agreed.\n\nI was able to find a venue (the local clubhouse), a DJ, and went with Chipotle for catering, all of which she OK'd. (I managed the process so that we would not go over budget.) I was able to put it all together for around $1500.\n\nWell, I guess I should have predicted this, but although Anna agreed that the party would be done on a budget, apparently it wasn't good enough for her. When we entered the venue on the day of her party, it was clear that she was disappointed. The party itself seemed to go fine.\n\nAt the end of the night, we drove home in silence, and I could tell she was upset. When we got home, Anna stormed off to her room without even so much as a \"thank you.\"\n\nThe next morning, Anna laid into me, saying that her \"cheap ass party\" left her feeling humiliated in front of all her friends. I reminded her that she agreed to my conditions, and she said she never would have done so if she knew I was going to \"cheap out so bad.\" I told her she should be grateful she even had a sweet sixteen party, something I never would have dreamed to ask my parents for.\n\nIt's been a week and Anna has barely spoken to me. I think she's being very entitled and my husband agrees with me, but my other daughter says she understands where Anna is coming from.

You're also kind of TA for letting that resentment bleed into your event planning --- you didn't ask about decor, didn't think to buy cheap decorations, didn't even research the DJ you begrudgingly hired?

Futhermore, her mom showed her the stuff she booked and Anna said it was OK, how exactly was her mom supposed to know she wasn't going to be happy with it? Her mom doesn't know what some typical sweet sixteen party is even like, she made an effort to ask the daughter if it was OK, while Anna didn't communicate and tell her what she exactly wanted. \n\nMaybe this is a bit different since I'm a teen, and if I tried to do something and screwed up I'd want my parents to appreciate it for me anyway, so the reverse should also be true. If Anna wants her mom to be happy for her even if she didn't do amazing, shouldn't she be happy that her mom at least tried?

For example, she could have proposed to her mom what venues would fit her ideal image of a sweet sixteen (doing some research - she knows herself the best after all). If she does a group project later on in the future, and she doesn't communicate with her groupmates how she wants the project to look like, causing the final result to be different from what she imagined is she going to throw a tantrum? I hope not. Communication is important in any relationship.

The way OP describes it makes it sound more like a youth club setup or just a trivia night in a pub function room, than an actual birthday party. It\u2019s ridiculous this was the set up when she spent $1500 all because simply because she put no effort into actually planning a decent birthday party.

The remaining $250 odd was spent on food. So when the two major cost factors are both complete busts, at some point you have to stand back and re-evaluate whether you made a good choice to spend on whatever you did. The $500 from the DJ could've easily been used to instead cover decor and they could've even pocketed the rest. Hell, they didn't even need to spend money on Spotify premium because your first 3 months are free! Just money would've been spent to maybe rent out a couple of big speakers. It truly is that simple. And to not even ASK a venue that you're spending $750 to rent out if they offer any decorations is abysmal planning on OP's end for sure. Why bother spending this much money if you're not even going to make sure it's well spent?", "Thank you for saying that.

In what world is a kid \\*entitled\\* to an expensive ass party, planned to perfection? I wouldn't have time for that, or money to hire a party planner. I work and do chores and take care of a household. And in what world does a good parent not at least attempt to sit down with their kid and figure out a compromise or try to make them happy on whatever budget they can muster? Having an authentic and loving (and ongoing!) conversation with your kids about household resources and budgetary restrictions is part of parenting.

Neither are at fault for that. \n\nBecause of this divide, it might have been better to involve the daughter in the planning and work on it together.

Not by herself, of course. But that she shouldn't be involved in the planning at all when she had very specific expectations? I find this absurd. If you know you have higher standards than the person you're asking to plan your party, take some initiative. 16 is old enough to know that and do that.

Like I also get not knowing that not all DJs play music and not thinking to check, but if she'd asked what kind of music her daughter wanted played at the party, she would've asked the DJ if he would play that and would have found out and could have gotten a different DJ or just set up speakers and an aux with a laptop or a phone. \n\nIt just seems like she resents that her daughter is different from her and even asked for a sweet 16, and instead of taking it as a teachable moment about how you can't always afford exactly what you want, but you can have a nice experience with your friends without spending a ton of money, and showing her that she and her interests are valued, OP seems to have just taught her that she won't even try if her daughter wants something she doesn't think is worthwhile.

I am an introvert who doesn't like parties that much, and my mother is an extrovert, so its the exact opposite but the stance is still the same. Regardless of whether or not you define enjoyment different from your child, you should meet them at their level. Its not your party, its not to give you attention, it isn't to gloat. I understand a concern for money, and clearly your daughter does too. If she was truly entitled, she would have had a problem the entire time. She did not. She had a problem because she had a party that was SUPPOSED to focus on her, but instead had a DJ that did trivia for the kids...which takes away from that focus, lack of decorations (her friends are probably poking fun at her for that, so good for you. The kids you hated in school, aka YOUR CHILD, could be getting bullied) and what? You get to complain because she's upset?\n\nHonestly, a major issue I have with parents of teenagers on this subreddit is that they usually come here to rant about the things they hate about their kids. Not that the kids did things wrong, just that they don't LIKE THEM. Children get upset. Teens get even more upset. You're lucky because she actually vocalized her issues with you (proper communication), versus just getting pissy or throwing attitude (what you're doing).\n\nYou give your children the better things in life, regardless of what you got growing up. Not WHAT YOU WANTED when you were younger, because your kids ARE NOT YOU. They are their own individuals, with wants and desires.\n\nWhat if this was a story about a woman who wanted a celebration for her birthday but her partner doesn't like parties, so instead of giving her what she wanted, the partner gave her something bad enough that she couldn't enjoy it? And then blamed it on not knowing anything about parties, when you really don't need to know much about parties, but just have to know stuff about the PERSON who WANTS IT? We would probably call that weaponized incompetence, in the hopes the woman never asks for a party ever again.\n\nYou didn't actually give in. You acted in a long haul con to make sure your child (and children as a whole, because the younger sibling was definitely paying attention) never asks for a party again. Good for you.

I originally had way more details, but the post was limited to 3000 characters and I had to cut a lot out. Sorry for leaving out what I see now are important details.\n\nSecond, regarding the decorations. People keep pointing out that decorations aren't expensive, but $1500 was the budget and I already just barely kept it within budget. And to everyone saying I could have looked on Pinterest and made my own decorations, I have to wonder if you would expect this if I was Dad instead of Mom? I'm the breadwinner for our family of four, and I work a very demanding full-time job (50+ hours a week). I don't have time to sit around making decorations by hand. Plus, I honestly figured the venue would AT LEAST have tablecloths, and maybe some basic centerpieces, but I understand that I should have read the contract more carefully and that's on me. I'm frankly floored that people here are making such a huge deal about something as trivial as tablecloths.\n\nThird, regarding the DJ. The DJ actually did start out playing music, but switched to trivia after 2-3 songs when it became evident that Anna and her friends weren't dancing. I think he made the best of an awkward situation - I don't see how it's his fault (or mine) if the kids aren't dancing.\n\nFinally, I'm really hurt and upset by all the people who have said that I \"obviously\" hate my daughter - clearly, a lot of you aren't parents and don't understand unconditional love. I left out a lot of details about why we have a difficult relationship because I didn't think it was relevant, but it sounds like you won't be happy without some additional context, so I'll try to enlighten you.\n\nMy daughter has always been very difficult to connect with, even from the moment she was born. She has always hated being held/cuddled, would scream and beat her head against walls for hours, and was seemingly was impossible to comfort or console. She was literally so high energy and aggressive that her preschool teachers would tell me that even the boys were afraid of her. While our pediatrician agreed that Anna's behavior was not normal, he assured me that she would grow out of it. People who didn't know her as a young child always think I'm exaggerating when I say how challenging she was, and I understand that some of you may find this description harsh. But she was honestly so intense and out-of-control that when I got pregnant with her sister, multiple friends exclaimed that they couldn't believe I was having another baby after Anna - one close friend even commented that she would be an alcoholic in my shoes. (Not a nice thing to say, obviously, but I am trying to paint an accurate picture for you all here.)  And to those of you saying her behavior was out of control because of my parenting, it's important to note that my younger daughter never had any of these issues - she was chill, laid back and happy. Hence why I have said in other comments that it's really a personality difference.\n\nAs Anna approached school age, I was worried she would be labeled as a \"problem child\" in public schools because of her out-of-control behavior, so I made the decision to send her to an expensive private school - this was a huge sacrifice for our family, but Anna was (and still is) incredibly smart and capable, and I wanted to make sure she was able to thrive without being unfairly judged from the get-go. Unfortunately, I couldn't afford to send her there anymore once her father and I divorced. I believe Anna has always resented me for divorcing her father and for taking her out of the expensive private school she loved. When I moved her to public school, just as I feared, several of her teachers wanted me to put her on medication for ADHD because of how hard she was to control. So I believe Anna dealt with a lot of unfair treatment from her teachers due to being unofficially labeled as ADHD, despite the fact that she always got good grades.\n\nThe behavior has gotten really bad since she became a teenager, I assume due to hormones.  That's not her fault, but it's hard to connect with someone who seems to constantly be angry with you and makes you feel like nothing you do for her is good enough. I work extremely hard so she can have a good life, including the fact that I plan to pay for her college so she can begin adult life debt-free. I feel like lots of other kids would kill for the life she has, but instead of appreciating it, Anna just seems to think I'm the devil. It breaks my heart every day, and I cry myself to sleep multiple times a week because of how viscous she can be. So, it's NOT just me being an introvert and her being an extrovert. Yes, we have different personalities, but I love her unconditionally, and it hurts like hell to feel like your daughter doesn't love you back.

It\u2019s not your forte but it also shouldn\u2019t solely have fallen on you, especially since she was the one who knew what she wanted.", "ESH. \u00a31500 on a 16th birthday party? Kids are so entitled these days.", "Glad you are not my mother.", "Info: why do you want so desperately to stick it to your daughter? Do you really hate her that much?", "YTA for the misleading title and also leaving out the details that there was no decorations, no table cloths, and the DJ only did trivia rather than played actual music for 16 year olds. You really built this post trying to make your daughter sound spoiled and entitled when in reality, you\u2019re a shitty person who didn\u2019t even do the bare minimum for a milestone in your daughter\u2019s life. Seems like your just bitter that she has a better childhood than you did which is weird because that should be a good thing.", "ESH", "Can\u2019t really potluck a sweet 16 though. And she had a cake and her friends. That didn\u2019t make her happy. Clearly OP isn\u2019t familiar with event planning, but a lot of people aren\u2019t. If a dad wrote this, I\u2019m not sure people would have expected him to know any better than OP did about whether tablecloths are supplied or to ask a DJ if they play music (since that is generally what DJs do, I\u2019m not sure why anyone would even think of that question).", "YTA for basically putting in the minimum.\nShe\u2019s also the asshole. She could\u2019ve helped and made it more to her liking", "YTA. Maybe a wiser choice for both of you was to give her a budget and let her lead planning the party?", "Yea YTA. You didn\u2019t even try. You threw money at the problem in the hopes it would shut your daughter up and then called her entitled when YOU spent it poorly with no regard to what she would actually enjoy. \n\nIn the Uk it\u2019s more common to throw this kind of party for an 18th however I moved out of home early so we had one for my 17th. My mum has never been big on parties but after I asked my parents, they set a budget and we planned it together! \n\nWe rented the community hall, cooked buffet food in the kitchen and just served it on disposable platters from Poundland. \nDad payed a mate who DJed on the side \u00a340 to set up his speakers and leave them for the night which we hooked up to a laptop but a halfway decent wireless speaker would of done. \nWe had an alcoholic and a soft punch on the side and a pi\u00f1ata with mini WKD bottles and sweets. We stuffed glow sticks into clear balloons and stung them along the ceiling and scattered around the floor with the extra glow sticks on a table so we could make bracelets \nMy parents and a few of their friends sat in the side room to roughly supervise and take care of us with a few buckets just in case. The whole thing cost less than \u00a3400 (including alcohol which you would omit for a group of 15-16 years olds, especially in the states) + venue costs and it\u2019s the best birthday I think I ever had. \n\nYou could of made the place beautiful and the event special for your daughter for less than what you spent. It could of been a learning experience for both of you; her learning the costs of these things and how to stick to a budget for events, and you connecting with your daughter and discovering what about these things she loves and what\u2019s important to her. \n\nYou didn\u2019t try, you decided it was stupid and unimportant and, from your comments, you only agreed so that she\u2019d leave you alone. YTA", "Your daughter is an extrovert by your own admission this is important to her but because it wasn't important to you as an introvert,  you didn't even try. This is hold the same vibe as \"I wont attend my kid's football games or provide them with the equipment because I don't like football and think the gear is overpriced even though it is all he ever talks about\" \n\nEven with that said, I was on your side mostly until I read your comments. No table clothes, No decorations, the Dj did trivia?! Did you research anything? 750 for a venue in my rural Midwest county of 25K people is cheap and I would expect a low level of service and ask what I needed to provide but to me the real kicker is no decorations!  When I have at home birthday parties for my kids I at least purchase some balloons. It seems you went extremely cheap and she would have been better off if you didn't have the party at all. \n\nYTA for not not even giving a crap and WASTING money on a half a\\*\\*ed party", "After reading through your comments, YTA. You got zero decorations, no music, claim shes some entitled brat because she has a bedroom, and has a SCHOOL PROVIDED laptop, and won\u2019t stop mentioning how you were poor 30 years ago so that means she somehow doesn\u2019t deserve a better life. Also, having a room to sleep does not make you spoiled. Neither does having a school issued electronic that YOU didn\u2019t pay for. \n\nYou purposely left out the details of the party to make yourself look good. You say she has no sense of how finances work, but she\u2019s 16. At 16 I definitely knew how money works. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to read the price of groceries, gas, menu prices, etc. \n\nYou either didn\u2019t actually spend the $1500, or you just didn\u2019t give a shit and spent it on whatever without any regard for what it\u2019d actually look like/turn out as. We have those trivia DJs in my area, and they\u2019re $200 for 5 hours. Trivia is not for a 16 yo, its for a 10yo. But like others mentioned you can easily do speakers with a personalized playlist for free. Any clubhouse Ive looked into for baby showers, parties, etc. are max $500, and those are on the nicer end for 5+ hours. How big was the space? Decor from dollar tree, party city, or DIY couldve been done for under $100. If you really spent nearly $1000 of the $1500 budget on the venue alone, thats on you for being irresponsible, and kind of seems like YOUR the one who doesn\u2019t know how money works. \n\nYou EASILY could\u2019ve done the party at your own home, with music over the TV, catered food, and decorations all for under $500. Instead, you decided to give her a shitty party to spite her. Seems like you lowballed it as much as possible to try and \u201cprove a lesson\u201d and make it seem like all parties cost tens of thousands of dollars. Which just isn\u2019t the case. \n\nIf you hate your daughter just say that. Obviously you\u2019re trying to give her a shitty upbringing because you had to suffer, so you think she has to suffer as well. No way you spent 1500 on this.", "light YTA, i get that you tried and did drop a lot of money, just seems like no research was done and it didn\u2019t turn out how she/friends would\u2019ve wanted", "OP - how are you going to apologize and correct this awful mistake?", "NTA.\n\nI am going to make a disclaimer here: I grew up white and middle-class in the 90s and 2000s in the suburbs. \n\nI know I came from privelage. And, I also know how long it took my parents to save up for my sweet sixteen hotel party (they rented out an executive sweet and ordered in pizza for all my friends) . \n\nI was thrilled and the most fun part was that my parents let me invite over 10 people. And we all slept in sleeping bags on the floor. \n\nThat being said, we also didn't have a DJ or any balroom space for the party. It was literally just the suite and pool access. But I still appreciate my mom and Dad for helping me with that. \n\nIt sounds like you did your best with the budget you had. One day, when she has to work for her money and understands responsibility I think she'll appreciate the party.\n\nRight now she's wrapped up in teen social woes and probably didn't realize until her party the big differences between her life and her friend's. That can be hard to cope with. At the end of the day you spent 1500. Damn if I had 1500 it would go straight to my medical debt. \n\nHopefully she can see that you did your best.", "YTA. After reading your comments, my god, you are absolutely the AH. Your daughter asked for a sweet sixteen, you originally said no. You didn't even discuss it with her, you just shut it down. Then, after begging you to reconsider, you BEGRUDGINGLY agreed to throw one for her as long as it was within budget. Okay, great. For the budget you'd set, you could have given your daughter an amazing birthday. Instead, you threw money at something and didn't even bother to check if it would be what you were looking for. \n\nI also grew up incredibly poor (even homeless at one point, we bounced around and stayed with relatives until we could afford a crappy apartment), and when I was 16, I also wanted to throw a sweet sixteen. You know what my mother told me? She told me if I could plan it and keep it under 500 dollars, she would take care of finding the venue for it. And I did it. I baked my own cake, played music through speakers, bought a cheap fog machine from a neighbor, and decorated using materials from the dollar store. I had a great time with my eight friends that showed up. My mother got food from Walmart and put together a little party buffet. It was fun and I remember it very fondly. You could have used this as an opportunity to teach your daughter about budgeting and financing, and instead you just did whatever it took to shut her up. \n\nThat's the difference between my mother and you, OP. I could feel my mom's love through the work she put in to make sure I would have a great night, and you tried to placate your daughter with money and no effort. Your daughter is right to be upset at you, and now she knows exactly how you really feel about her. Take this as a learning moment and apologize to her before your relationship is irrevocably ruined.", "i was going with N T A until i found out girl had no decoration and the freakin dj played trivia instead of music\u2026 of course she was embarrassed  i\u2019m not saying she needed an extravagant party worth thousands of dollars but you could have taken a speaker and an provided music yourself and you could have diy the decorations\u2026 if she had complained about that then maybe she\u2019s ungrateful but the entertainment and look is most important part of a party. \ud83d\ude44 if didn\u2019t want to do it right then should have stuck with no and let her have a smaller party or shopping spree or something equally as special with her friends 16 is a big one\u2026 btw a phone and computer and own room at that age doesn\u2019t make a spoiled kid.. that\u2019s what normal 16 year olds have and if couldn\u2019t afford it that\u2019s fine some people can\u2019t but having things like that doesn\u2019t mean spoiled. do you buy her gucci bags? diamond bracelets? she play an expensive sport or have an expensive hobby? sounds like you have a normal 16 year old child.", "Her reaction was to be STUNNED and to scold her daughter for asking.
