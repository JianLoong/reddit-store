{"id": 7559, "submission_id": "10e3vna", "title": "AITA for not throwing my daughter an extravagant birthday party?", "selftext": "My daughter Anna (16f) and I (45f) have very different personalities - I'm an introvert whose idea of a perfect night is curling up with a good book, and she's an extrovert who prefers going out with friends. She's also grown up far more privileged than I was - I grew up in a cramped apartment in a poor immigrant neighborhood, while Anna and her sister (13f) have their own rooms, computers and cell phones. (This seems to be the norm where we live, but it's a big culture shock for me.) Our relationship has always been challenging due to our different personalities and upbringings, but things seem to have gotten much more difficult since Anna became a teenager. We fight a lot, and though I of course love her, I often find her to be very demanding & entitled.\n\nLast year, Anna said that she wanted a big party for her \"sweet sixteen.\" When I asked what she had in mind, she said she wanted something like the parties that her friends had for their bat mitzvahs. Even knowing how extroverted she is, I was STUNNED that Anna would ask for such an extravagant event, which there's no way we could afford - after all, those kinds of parties cost tens of thousands of dollars! Of course, I shut it down immediately. This made her very angry, and we had a huge argument. I just literally could not believe that she would ask for something so frivolous as an expensive party that only lasts a couple hours.\n\nFor weeks, Anna kept begging me to have a sweet sixteen, insisting it was important to her to have a big party with all her friends for a \"milestone birthday.\" I got so tired of arguing about it that I finally relented and agreed to it - however, I explained that it was going to be on a budget. She said she understood and agreed.\n\nI was able to find a venue (the local clubhouse), a DJ, and went with Chipotle for catering, all of which she OK'd. (I managed the process so that we would not go over budget.) I was able to put it all together for around $1500.\n\nWell, I guess I should have predicted this, but although Anna agreed that the party would be done on a budget, apparently it wasn't good enough for her. When we entered the venue on the day of her party, it was clear that she was disappointed. The party itself seemed to go fine.\n\nAt the end of the night, we drove home in silence, and I could tell she was upset. When we got home, Anna stormed off to her room without even so much as a \"thank you.\"\n\nThe next morning, Anna laid into me, saying that her \"cheap ass party\" left her feeling humiliated in front of all her friends. I reminded her that she agreed to my conditions, and she said she never would have done so if she knew I was going to \"cheap out so bad.\" I told her she should be grateful she even had a sweet sixteen party, something I never would have dreamed to ask my parents for.\n\nIt's been a week and Anna has barely spoken to me. I think she's being very entitled and my husband agrees with me, but my other daughter says she understands where Anna is coming from.

Of course she\u2019s upset, her party sucked and she was embarrassed in front of her friends.\n\nYou made the barest minimum of efforts to give your daughter what she had asked for, to the point where she would have been better off if you had just said \u201cno\u201d and gotten her to pick something else. Like, weaponized incompetence levels of effort.", "YTA based on your comments. You couldnt get a few decorations for the venue? And the DJ didnt even play music but instead did trivia. If you were willing to throw her a party you should have put in some effort. Instead you showed her how little you cared and embarassed her in front of her friends.", "INFO:  any additional specifics on what elements Anna found cheap?  You said she approved the venue, DJ, and food.  Was it the quantity of food?  Lack of decorations?  I feel like something is missing.\n\nEdited to add:  YTA.  It sounds like you didn\u2019t even try.  Why did you not ask the venue about decorations or tablecloth?  Why did you not ask the DJ about his routine?  Trivia is very different from music.  You also go out of your way to elaborate about how entitled your daughter is without providing these crucial details.  \n\nThis was probably really humiliating for her and it may have been better for all not to have had a party at all.", "YTA. You tried but you didn't really try.", "Here\u2019s the thing: my mom raised 4 kids on a teacher\u2019s salary. Our birthday parties were AWESOME! She put together themes for them, did great decorations, made sure it was special. It\u2019s not about the money. She put in the time and effort. You could have gotten some balloons, some streamers. A fucking tablecloth. You should have done that. YTA. Try to find a way to make it up to her.", "YTA \nYou should have better communicated details with your daughter so she had realistic expectations.  Imagine how much better everything could have gone if you actively involved her in the planning and had a real sense of what she was hoping for.   It\u2019s quite likely that she assumed you were putting together an actual party as opposed to Chipotle dinner in a dark clubhouse.   Sure she okayed it all, but probably assumed there was more to it than those three components and that you were taking care of it. You\u2019re the adult.  You failed to communicate.", "The way this post was written I actually forgot you were her bio mother and raised her. I assumed you were her step mother who has only been in her life for a few years.\n\nIt\u2019s strange that you\u2019re shocked at her upbringing\u2026considering you\u2019re the one who brought her up. My mum was an immigrant and we are POLAR opposites but she made the effort to just understand me and not judge me for that. And I did the same. My mum worked really hard to build a life for me and my siblings but she doesn\u2019t hold it over our heads because we had a better upbringing.\n\nShe\u2019s 16. What 16 year old isn\u2019t entitled or demanding these days. And sweet 16s have this massive pressure these days, especially with social media, for being extravagant. While I commend you for trying, it seems like you didn\u2019t understand how much it meant to her enough to go out of your way. We get a few milestone birthdays in our lives, a little extra effort isn\u2019t gonna kill you. You said that the DJ barely played any music or that you didn\u2019t have any table cloths. Just because this isn\u2019t a big deal for you, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a big deal to her. You guys really need to work on communicating better. She\u2019s 15 if you don\u2019t start getting to a common ground, when she moves out in a few years, it may be too late", "YTA. Just because you're an introvert doesn't mean your daughter has to hide away too. How could you downplay her sweet 16?", "YTA..... There's no need to throw a something super expensive and extravagant. However, putting some actual effort in IS required. It sounds like you hired the first/cheapest DJ you could find and you didn't even decorate. A Sweet 16 is considered a milestone in the U.S. just like a Quinceanera for Hispanic cultures. Just because some of us choose not to have them, doesn't mean they're not important.", "YTA. It seems like you cared more about teaching Anna a lesson than throwing her a birthday party. You should have spent the $1500 where it would be the most meaningful. That means food, decorations\u2014stuff to make it feel like a party. Walmart has aisles and aisles of cheap party decorations, a lot of them even say \u201cSweet 16.\u201d Spotify, Pandora, iTunes could have functioned instead of a DJ. Maybe you could have even done the party outside at home instead of booking a venue. \n\nNext time, budget better so your daughter doesn\u2019t walk into an empty room and think, \u201cWhere\u2019s my party?\u201d", "INFO\n\nBased on the raw words/content of this post, it *sounds* like you were in the right. **But** there's a lot of assertions/accusations thrown towards her as to intent. Where gut instinct? I'm suspecting this is likely a symptom of a much deeper issue, I felt very defensive just on her behalf reading this with all the \"privileged\", \"demanding\" and \"entitled\" statements being thrown at her.\n\nSo I can't help but think at least a piece of this may be built from defensiveness/tension over time. And being perfectly honest, in a child-parent dynamic, when there's a tension or defensiveness going on. It usually can be traced back to something the parent did to make the child feel unloved, conditionally loved, judged or unwanted.\n\nOnce again, INFO, so none of this is concrete. This is just the general impression I'm getting based on the tone and word choice of this post. I don't think she acted properly in this situation mind you, this isn't a defense for her actions. But if my gut reading this post is correct, it would explain how it got so bad.", "YTA. You wasted money not her.  You chose to spend $1500 on a crappy birthday party.  You should have had decorations and music, not trivia.\n\n\n\nI get you grea up poor, so did my parents.  and it seems like you want your kids to feel the same.  Most people want their kids to have better and easier lives - do you? \n\n\nSince you aren\u2019t used to doing this sort of thing, you should have asked a fellow parent - who is good - for help. You don\u2019t need to spend thousands of dollars for a fun time. Why didn\u2019t you? \n\n\nI hope you will apologize to\nYour daughter, offer to spend another $1000 and work with another parent to redo this.", "YTA.\n\nYou're falling into the 'I don't value X, therefore X has no value, and anybody who does value X is objectively wrong' fallacy.\n\nYou also seem to be straight-up jealous of her. Your job as parent is to give her a better life than you had, not to resent her for it.\n\nYour daughter seems quite entitled if she's expecting a five figure party.  But where did she get that entitled attitude from?\n\nLike, I wouldn't throw a five figure party either, because I don't have the money to.  But I wouldn't judge somebody merely for wanting one.  Hell, if I had the money, I, an introverted hermit, would absolutely throw one for myself, and I would sit up on a raised dais, and I would silently toast people, and I would preside as king for a day.  There would be a velvet rope, and there would be large gentlemen wearing tuxedos and sunglasses manning that rope, and I would let it be known to all invited that I would be having great fun giving indolent waves or imperious but slight headshakes at my whim.  I would ask them all to show up dressed in their gaudiest, most horrible 'we're all pretending to be international jet setters but we're really not' outfits.  It would be a blast.\n\nBut that's just me.", "YTA \n\nWas about to go with NTA until I discovered you put no effort whatsoever into the party, I would be disappointed in you, you could have bought some decorations and tablecloth \n\nIntrovert or not, not cool mom, you didn\u2019t care at all for making the party fun for her", "YTA. She\u2019s not upset with you because you \u201ccheaped out.\u201d She\u2019s upset with you because you didn\u2019t care at all about something that was important to her. Within that budget, you could absolutely have made it special, even magical, but it sounds like it was a very sad affair.", "YTA. This can probably be classified as \u201cmalicious compliance\u201d. You seem to resent your daughter for having or wanting more than you had growing up.", "YTA.\n\nYou didn't care. You just went and hired the bare minimum and never did research about it. It's not about the money, nobody is enttled to a party, but if you choose to throw one you must be a part of the organization.\n\nYou signed a contract for the venue and never read about tablecloth?, never asked?\n\nYou hired a DJ but you didn't know what music he played -he played none- and it seemed right.\n\nYou failed your daughter, you just wanted to made a lesson out of a milestone birthday. Heck, it even seems like you were somehow taking revenge against the extrovert kids by ruining the party.", "YTA\n\nHaving a strict budget is good and understandable, but not bothering to have decorations or making sure the DJ would actually play music??? Of course, she is humiliated.", "You are the one that raised her that way.

I encourage you to look deeper as to why you resent your own outgoing child just because she isn\u2019t like you.", "YTA. I have read your comments. There is no way you could have been this obtuse. You purposefully tanked the party, probably so she would never ask anything of you again and to teach her a lesson.", "YTA. the normal and healthy feeling of a parent towards a child is to want them to have a better childhood in every way than the parent had.\n\nYour entire post screams that you antagonize your daughter for her having a better childhood than you did.\n\nYou experienced shortcomings in your childhood and now you want to reflect that in her and in her life at every opportunity. That is an unhealthy envy and a constant punishment that you do to her not only for what I pointed out above, but for her being her own person and not being like you.\n\nYou are going to deny it until the end here, to her and to everyone without rest, because arrogant people are like that, they live in denial, but deep inside you know that you did it so that she would \"learn\" according to your parameters and shame her to teach her not ask you for anything more and to no longer have the extroversion that you lack.\n\nIrrational punishment for envy and bitterness.\nIt's a terrible thing, I'm telling you very honestly, go to therapy and cure that. Because that behavior of yours is going to escalate and you are going to project it into all your interactions with your daughter until she decides that she can no longer deal with you and your bitterness.", "ESH. \n\n1) personality differences are not an excuse for throwing a party. Your budget concern *was* but the idea that you just didn\u2019t want to because you\u2019re an introvert is ridiculous. Plan the party. Sit in a corner and watch your daughter be happy. \n\n2) I agree that *children* don\u2019t understand that things cost money and for the level of extravagance your daughter wanted, wasn\u2019t something you could match. There were opportunities for you to convey that message to her and it sounds like you didn\u2019t. You could have done without a DJ, have your daughter create a playlist of music she would like.

If you\u2019re showing Anna that you have limitless funds and she has this fabricated idea that you\u2019re rich and doesn\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t afford a birthday party for her, then maybe you should be more transparent on family funds so she can *understand* why you were unable to reach her extravagance level.

Sounds like you\u2019ve coddled her so much that she thinks she can have whatever she wants", "YTA for thinking that because you had it a certain way, anything you give your kids beyond that is outrageous. Just because you had less growing up doesn\u2019t mean your kids should too. Times are changing, you need to keep up, not the other way around. You know teens are impressionable. Kids that age tend to be really mean, you know that she will be teased with that sort of party. Was it intentional because you wanted to teach her a lesson?

But I also don\u2019t think she has any idea what things actually cost. She should have been more involved in the planning process.

Which, is not her fault, but yours. It\u2019s funny how you say that they have seperate bedrooms and cell phones and computers like it\u2019s bad when you\u2019re the one who provided those things. I feel that this behavior has really been enabled by you.\n\nAnyway, yes, your daughter is being extremely unreasonable. Most kids would never have a party with a venue and DJ, I\u2019m not sure what she was expecting since she had approved all the choices.

She's also grown up far more privileged than I was - I grew up in a cramped apartment in a poor immigrant neighborhood, while Anna and her sister (13f) have their own rooms, computers and cell phones. (This seems to be the norm where we live, but it's a big culture shock for me.) Our relationship has always been challenging due to our different personalities and upbringings, but things seem to have gotten much more difficult since Anna became a teenager. We fight a lot, and though I of course love her, I often find her to be very demanding & entitled.\n\nLast year, Anna said that she wanted a big party for her \"sweet sixteen.\" When I asked what she had in mind, she said she wanted something like the parties that her friends had for their bat mitzvahs. Even knowing how extroverted she is, I was STUNNED that Anna would ask for such an extravagant event, which there's no way we could afford - after all, those kinds of parties cost tens of thousands of dollars! Of course, I shut it down immediately. This made her very angry, and we had a huge argument. I just literally could not believe that she would ask for something so frivolous as an expensive party that only lasts a couple hours.\n\nFor weeks, Anna kept begging me to have a sweet sixteen, insisting it was important to her to have a big party with all her friends for a \"milestone birthday.\" I got so tired of arguing about it that I finally relented and agreed to it - however, I explained that it was going to be on a budget. She said she understood and agreed.\n\nI was able to find a venue (the local clubhouse), a DJ, and went with Chipotle for catering, all of which she OK'd. (I managed the process so that we would not go over budget.) I was able to put it all together for around $1500.\n\nWell, I guess I should have predicted this, but although Anna agreed that the party would be done on a budget, apparently it wasn't good enough for her. When we entered the venue on the day of her party, it was clear that she was disappointed. The party itself seemed to go fine.\n\nAt the end of the night, we drove home in silence, and I could tell she was upset. When we got home, Anna stormed off to her room without even so much as a \"thank you.\"\n\nThe next morning, Anna laid into me, saying that her \"cheap ass party\" left her feeling humiliated in front of all her friends. I reminded her that she agreed to my conditions, and she said she never would have done so if she knew I was going to \"cheap out so bad.\" I told her she should be grateful she even had a sweet sixteen party, something I never would have dreamed to ask my parents for.\n\nIt's been a week and Anna has barely spoken to me. I think she's being very entitled and my husband agrees with me, but my other daughter says she understands where Anna is coming from.

Methinks she's not the entitled one, or if she is, it's because you're willing to put in no effort even if you are willing to put in money so why would you ever be able to execute anything to her standards?
