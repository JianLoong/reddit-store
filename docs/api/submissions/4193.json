So either way, she would be upset with you for \u201cruining\u201d her birthday by having more than one simultanious emotion and not \u201cbeing there 100%\u201d for her birthday fun. \n\nJust to be clear, I think it is insane of her to expect you to try to stage the above masquerade. \n\nFair enough that she is trigged, but there are ways to say that and you cant expect people to both be in a situation you dont want to engage with AND spend a weekend together without showing a trace of it. So what did she expect you to do?", "NTA. You also have the right to set boundaries. Good for you for allowing yourself the space you need to process your emotions.", "NTA\n\nYour \"friend\" needs to recalibrate her sensitivity chip. \n\nIf you need to change topic because it's triggering, at least be apologetic about it (I'm sure you've been there for her at her worse times).\n\nIf your friend can't visit because they're grieving, where do you find the gall to be upset at them?

It's okay for her to set that boundary, if that's what she needs to cope, but it's also okay if you don't want a friend who can't be there for you when you're grieving.\n\nI'm inclined to say NAH, because you're both asserting your needs, which just happen to be incompatible. But, if you canceled your trip solely because she asserted her needs, and that made you mad, then that's a little bit on you, because she's entitled to do that. If however, you canceled your trip because you don't think that you can be around her and honor her wishes, or because you've decided that you don't want to be friends with her anymore, then I would stick with NAH.", "NTA You can't turn off your grief just because someone else doesn't like it, or is hurt by it.

If the way she expressed that boundary hurt you in some way, talk to her about that. It is okay that you postpone your trip because you are grieving. Give yourself time to process this loss and tell your friend you can plan a trip later or for her next birthday. Friends are not obligated to help you through hard situations especially when it\u2019s triggering for them. Ideally that is what therapists are for but I realize that isn\u2019t an option for everyone. Forgive your friend for not being able to help you through this one and if she also understands why you can\u2019t come right now but will later, that is a great friendship worth keeping.

How inconvenient!", "That\u2019s a pretty selfish one sided take. \n\nNot every friend is right for every situation. Neither the OP nor the friend in question should be made to feel uncomfortable for their needs and boundaries.\n\nAfter I was beaten and raped, it took me several years to be able to talk to others about their SA. It was very triggering for me. I didn\u2019t want to be a bad friend but I also had to protect my own mental health while I worked through things. \n\nLater in life going through a divorce, there were friends I could talk to about it and some I couldn\u2019t as they just were not in the right headspace for that.\n\nPart of friendship is respecting boundaries and knowing if you\u2019re asking too much.", "Why did it make you feel embarrassed and frustrated?", "Actually I don't think that isn't valid at all and I'll tell you why... That happened to her when she was a child so now for the rest of her life she's no longer going to console her friends who lose people? What about when she suffers another death? Honestly her not wanting to talk to you on the telephone makes her sound selfish, not traumatized.  How hard is it just to say I'm sorry for your loss? She doesn't sound like a very good friend and I wouldn't travel to see her either. Friendship is a 2 way street and consoling each other when you have death affecting you is a part of friendship. I'm not gonna stuff down my grief just to make a friend happy and you shouldn't either.", "She's going to find it difficult to have lasting meaningful friendships if she's incapable of handling illness and death for the rest of her life. I lost my mom traumatically when I was 22, and it made me *more* empathetic about others' suffering, not less.

So there's no trauma?", "Totally fair to have your own triggers and on a personal note, I\u2019m sorry you experienced SA.

That\u2019s exactly what this friend is doing, and she can\u2019t have it both ways. It\u2019s fair to say, hey, I can\u2019t support you through this, but you can\u2019t expect people to mask their grief for the sake of not cancelling plans.

There wasn\u2019t much for her to deal with because I am 3k miles away but she didn\u2019t want to hear about that either. This felt like that situation. We\u2019ve never discussed her grandmother or grief so I was unaware that was a difficult situation for her. She asked how my day was and I told her it was rough because I miss my uncle.

She\u2019s allowed her triggers and boundaries, but she should consider managing these issues better if they prevent her from providing five minutes of compassion. And of course, you are allowed your own boundaries, including allowing yourself time to grief and not taking on the responsibility of protecting her from what are her issues to deal with.", "NTA.", "NTA. Does she expect you to be all jolly while visiting like nothing has happened? Friendship is about being there for eachother. She can kick rocks.", "NTA. You don't just get to say \"boundary!\" and do whatever you want.", "Not necessarily. Friend may not be able to provide support due to her own trauma around loss. Additionally, friend may be worried about compounding OP's grief. I'm a widow who is facing the loss, sometime in the next few years, of one of my closest friends, who has terminal cancer.  I feel terribly conflicted around how much support I'll be able to offer to her husband, because my grief is still raw and I don't want to add to his by it getting all messed up with mine.", "TBH, I think friend might see OP as \u201cpunishing\u201d her for having boundaries. \n\nFriend couldn\u2019t help with the grief so OP cancelled to get back at her. \n\nNot saying that\u2019s OP\u2019s intention, but I bet that\u2019s how friend sees it.", "I think that the friend is in for a world of trouble if she can't hear anything about grief.

It is also completely out of anyone's control when someone they love dies AND when you get the call about it.", "No. Being a doormat who never shares personal troubles is not being supportive to anyone. Her friend is an ass with the emotional capacity of a cockroach.\n\nA boundary of \u201cdon\u2019t seek comfort from me\u201d is certainly a \u201cboundary\u201d someone can set, but then that person isn\u2019t a friend. (actually, a properly set boundary would be: if you talk about your grief I will hang up. Because boundaries are for YOU not other people).", "The friend isn't an AH for not being able to support OP - but for being upset at OP for not coming.", "Agreed, it could easily be taken that way. With some communication this could be cleared up, if so, though. If you do want to keep the friendship, OP, you could explain that you'd been looking forward to the trip, and hope you can reschedule later, but since you're grieving your uncle and want the trip to be fun instead of sad or triggering, you're going to get past the shock and grief of it all first. NAH", "That\u2019s a little presumptive. Grief tends to get less raw as time goes on. If Friend recently had a death related trauma, that will lessen over time.", "Per OP, she doesn't want to talk about it because her grandma died as a child. That is pretty absurd to me, this isn't a fresh wound or anything. Bad friend for sure.", "I feel that OP would have mentioned \"since her mom recently died\" or \"is also experiencing loss right now\" if that was the case. I could be wrong, but OP's wording didn't indicate to me that the friend was also freshly grieving.", "Stupid TikTok and internet pseudo-psychobabble have people all asserting \u201cboundaries\u201d and calling any emotional topic \u201ctriggering\u201d and seeking support from of venting to a friend \u201ctrauma dumping.\u201d These are all real things! But the common usage of these terms is pretty far removed from how they are used in actual mental health diagnosis and treatment. It all boils down to excuses to be disconnected from people and a poor friend and never do anything uncomfortable no matter how much it alienates someone else.\n\nThat\u2019s what is happening here. Your friend isn\u2019t triggered. She didn\u2019t set a boundary. *She doesn\u2019t care about your feelings!* She has no willingness to expend emotional bandwidth on your problems and is proudly unsupportive. She is a bad friend for refusing to listen to you about both your health problems and your grief. \n\nA real friend would give their condolences and do what they can to comfort you.", "Her 'boundaries' are bizarre. Her grief over the death of her grandmother as a child apparently blocks anyone else from expressing their own grief around her. That's a veto, not a healthy boundary.\n\nA lot of people have learned therapeutic language, but twist it into a tool for manipulating other people. You don't have to buy into it. If someone has a cruel or unreasonable boundary, your boundary can be not associating with them again.", "You should update the original post to add these details, it makes the story very, very clear. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. And I\u2019m very sorry for your loss. \n\nMost adults have experienced at least one difficult loss. I have to say that if I felt I couldn\u2019t support a grieving loved for whatever reason (however valid), I would feel I owed them more of an explanation than vagueries like \u201ctriggering\u201d and \u201cboundaries\u201d. And this is specifically because their feelings are incredibly important to me, and I would want them to know how much I care about them and their loss, even if I wouldn\u2019t be capable of processing the details with them or supporting them closely.\n\nBringing a recent loss and the grief that comes with it into a conversation with a close friend is not overstepping boundaries. I don\u2019t doubt that your friend has her reasons for avoiding reliving a traumatic loss or something, but by shutting you down so abruptly and without clarity and compassion, she showed a disregard for preserving your feelings. So you\u2019re NTA for doing that for yourself.", "A friend is a person I share interests with and also I can rely on in bad times. YOu are going through a tough time and she not only neglects it, but actually tries to silence you about that? This person is not your friend. NTA", "NTA. If she want her boundaries respected. She has to respect yours. Her boundaries are not to discuss grief and loss. Your boundaries are you are grieving. You need support.  If she can not offer that support.  That fair and exceptable. It's also exceptable that you need that. Need to spend time with people who can meet your needs. Offer the visit for a time in future.  Her birthday is not a concern in this matter.   Your boundaries don't get crossed because of that. If she does not get that. She is not someone you should consider a friend any longer", "NTA.     This is not a good friend. At the very least, you should not be around her while you are grieving if you having these emotions is a 'boundary' for her.", "NTA. Your friend acted like a gibbering asshole to you, boundaries or no. Being triggered by something isn't an excuse to treat your friends like shit, especially at a time like this.", "A better way to react would be to say \u201cI feel like this will be something I need to process for some time, can I please have that time to myself?\u201d Not \u201cwell you won\u2019t let me grieve on you, so I\u2019m going to cancel plans because I don\u2019t feel like it anymore\u201d", "No honey lol, \u201cI feel dismissed and not so inclined to fly to spend time with her\u201d you\u2019re doing it because she wouldn\u2019t allow you to pour your grief on her. Don\u2019t try to twist it after the fact into \u201cwell I knew then that I couldn\u2019t see her because I knew I\u2019d still be grieving openly around her\u201d you said you don\u2019t feel inclined to do so anymore because she didn\u2019t do what you expected of her. Your intentions were petty.", "Where does it say anything about the friends reaction? It doesn\u2019t. It just shows her reaction. She\u2019s asking if she\u2019s the asshole for canceling because her friend set a boundary. Not if she\u2019s the asshole because she canceled it OVER needing to process that grief.", "Yes, I think that\u2019s exactly what she would say if she were here and I can definitely understand why she would feel that way and thinking about her being alone on her birthday makes me feel very guilty about that. I am just very sad about my uncle and I feel very awkward about being around her and I am very hurt by the way she spoke to me and I\u2019m not sure I want to continue the friendship now despite how well we do get along when I\u2019m not going through a difficult moment. \n\nUltimately I should just call her and clarify that but I\u2019m still kind of emotional about it and she\u2019s sensitive so I don\u2019t know how to approach it. This situation is so wack lol.", "Because it's all about her, the inconvenient dead uncle and the friend in pain are irrelevant. And OP must pretend to be in party mode days after somone she loved passed away, otherwise she's a monster for triggering her again. That's what makes the friend an AH.", "I'm so sorry that you're going through both of those losses. Internet hugs \u2764\ufe0f", "Lol", "Sometimes, friendship just end. They reach a point where they can\u2019t continue. \n\nBut, if you want to try, in a few weeks, you could call her and ask what exactly her boundaries are (so you know ahead of time so you don\u2019t feel rejected when you reach out to her) and talk about how you felt rejected both times she said she couldn\u2019t deal with your life. \nAnd see how it goes from there.", "You really don't need to keep sucking up to a bad friend. She's a fair-weather self-centered person, not a friend. Who the hell tells a grieving friend to stop talking about their loved one then proceeds to talk about their crush instead. I'd have slammed the phone down on her.\n\nThat on top of her getting upset you won't make it to her birthday because you're still grieving (and not allowed to do it in her presence), if I were in your shoes, I'd even ghost her. You are already too nice to even be speaking to her.\n\nEta: it's probably the reason why she has no friends where she is, not even one to lunch out with, too self-centered. (Can you tell this person annoys the hell out of me lol she comes off worse the more we see of her from your replies)", "Important question, did she say \"I'm sorry for your loss\" or anything to those words at all? I'm no good at dealing with people grief but it's never been an issue because I have sympathy for them, but as a very depressed person I can't deal with help with it. I usually say something to the tune of \"I'm sorry for your loss, but for my own mental health, I can't help someone deal with grief\"", "Yeah, honestly this friend is going to eventually run out of friends if she never allows anyone to talk about grief around her. That is not a healthy boundary. Good grief.", "Regardless of what happened, your friend is so self centred, I would not have expected my grieving friend to still make it to my bday celebrations knowing that their loved one just died the week before???", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss and am sending you love across the internet.\n\nYour friend is both selfish and stupid. Every single person in the world will experience loss and grief. That's a fact. Her saying that it's \"triggering\" for her that you are grieving is absurd and hurtful. If she can't be there for you during your sadness, then you shouldn't be there for her joy...", "Nta... she set a boundary and you complied. You cant turn off grief, and it is uncomfortable to play pretend the whole time. Real friends are there to help", "NAH", "NTA but your friend is. She expects you to fly across the country a week after your uncle died but you\u2019re not allowed to talk to her about it because she\u2019s triggered? Nah. That\u2019s selfish as hell.", "i agree, expecting your grieving friend to just suppress their feelings to put on a fake happy face so that a trip isn\u2019t ruined is self-centered AH behavior. NTA OP", "Thank you- that was my first reaction and I started to think I was crazy when I saw so many people defending the friend. \n\nGrief is NEVER convenient. It is 100% guaranteed to be a part of everyone\u2019s life (assuming they have relationships of any sort) though and that -to me- is really when you need your friends the most.  \nI\u2019ve dealt with a lot of losses, more than any of my friends, and I can\u2019t imagine not being \u201callowed\u201d to to talk about a recent loss. NTA, I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "I can\u2019t say if she is a bad friend or a fair-weather friend based on this. She isn\u2019t going to be there for you when death is the issue. Maybe she WILL BE right there if you went through a nasty breakup, lost a pet, lost a job, all the laundry list of bad things that your friends help you through. \n\nMaybe she needed this birthday weekend for reasons OP doesn\u2019t know (or we don\u2019t know). Not all friends are perfectly supportive, not all friends all all that good at it", "NTA. You are grieving, she said grieving upsets her. So tell her that you are not coming because  you cannot just turn your feelings off for a weekend. And you don\u2019t want to \u201ctrigger\u201d her. \n\nIf she argues, say If she had been more understanding of your feelings you would have come! Put the blame on her - where it belongs since she was very self centered about her triggers, gave you no sympathy at all!", "Hey OP. \n\nMy uncle died three months ago Monday. He and my aunt lived with us for over fifteen years, most of my childhood and adolescence. I\u2019m acquainted with this pain you\u2019re feeling quite well. I heard a TV show character, I don\u2019t remember which one, say that \u201cThere were some days I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever survive the sadness.\u201d I have those days still. Every day gets a little easier though. \n\nAnd I have a similar, contentious friendship that, while I was grieving on the first couple of weeks, eventually I couldn\u2019t maintain. They were going through pretty rough times too, and I tried to be gentle about that, but they were my closest friend at the time. They shut me down a lot when I just wanted to talk, or when I would try to talk about other stuff completely unrelated and funny, and every other time they were telling me that they just couldn\u2019t handle talking about whatever they didn\u2019t want to hear. Whether it was my grief, or fun facts, or a related story to what they had just said. Some of it I understood as boundaries, some of it -after some reflection- I can recognize as unkind. \n\nSometimes, we aren\u2019t compatible with our friends after something as complicated and life altering as death happens. I don\u2019t feel the same as I used to three months ago, and I know I\u2019m not ever really gonna feel the same. It was *really* hard and I needed a kind of friend that they couldn\u2019t be. Whether that means I\u2019m the asshole or they were, I\u2019m not sure it matters. I no longer was the person I had been for the entirety of our friendship. Maybe I\u2019ll get back there or somewhere close, but for now, I\u2019m different. *That* is no one\u2019s fault but Death himself. \n\nSometimes what we need when this stuff happens, not everyone can provide. And that\u2019s okay. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a bad person or a bad friend. It doesn\u2019t even have to mean they\u2019re a bad person, or that they\u2019ll always be that. \n\nIt\u2019s the hard truth of life, and of death, that people change and grow, and friendships fade. But it doesn\u2019t mean there has to be fault in someone. Sometimes that\u2019s just the way the wind blows. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss\u201d and all the other sayings always made me pissed off, so I\u2019ll offer music instead. I don\u2019t know how you like bluegrass music, but this song in particular has helped me the last few months. Maybe it can do the same for you. Its not a song about grief actually, but it felt like when I first heard it. Sure it\u2019s a cover of Tom Petty, and it\u2019s not the original, but I like this version a lot. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/XdgY-CQsbKU", "NTA - What a rude response to somebody's grief. This person is not your friend.", "NTA. She has her \u2018boundaries\u2019, and you have yours. She seems like a shitty friend.", "If the friend sees it that way then she\u2019s being very self-centered. Friend\u2019s boundary about not wanting to be exposed to OP\u2019s grief is something she can have. What she can\u2019t demand is that OP push aside her grief to spare her; OP is fair to respond that how she will respect her friend\u2019s boundary is by not visiting while she is grieving.", "Is she emotionally supportive in situations outside of grief? Does the relationship feel mutually supportive or one sided. \n\nI can definitely understand feeling rejected and dismissed, especially if it\u2019s a boundary you weren\u2019t aware of. On the other hand, if this is part of a larger pattern of behavior, you may want to reevaluate what you\u2019re getting from the relationship.", "My grandmother died when I was 16, I'm 31 and still cry when I think or talk about her.", "She might not be a compatible friend, I'd end things at that point cause I wouldn't be able to be friends with someone who had those boundaries", "After reading the rest of your comments, I'd lean NTA.\n\nThis isn't the first time your friend has refused to be there for you during hard times, but she expects you to be her wailing wall without reciprocation.  She says it's due to triggers, but considering how tactless she is when she immediately tries to shift the conversation back to you simply being a listener for her rather than caring that you may not be up to playing therapist, and you've had to be a constant mental health support for her, to me it sounds like, in reality, she's an emotional leech.\n\nHeck, she can still have these triggers and still be an emotional leech.  If someone is callous about the feelings of those who support them and expect them to drop all of thier own needs and feelings and play on call free therapist, then that's more likely to be manipulation. \n\nLook over your friendship with this person.  Is this an equal relationship that has actual positive points, or have you been made to feel responsible for her emotional well being and are driven by guilt to support her because if you don't, you don't know who else will?  If you feel things aren't that bad, talk to her.  Say that you respect her boundaries, but she cannot expect you to be her rock when you are struggling.  If she can't listen about these things, then the least she can do is not expect you to slap on a happy face and sit there nodding while she dumps her own issues on you.  That's not fair.  If it's the latter, you then it's not a friendship.  You can't be the custodian of someone else's happiness.  That's up to them.", "I can't believe I had to scroll all the way to find this comment.", "Yes. It's fine to set some \"boundaries\", but then we're not really friends. That's fine too."]}
