Got a 4 year old car in great condition.\nCollected the car 2 days ago. My wife said a few times that when she first drives the car she wants it to be in a quiet area \u2013 she struggles with anxiety in general.\nWe set off this morning and I\u2019m already feeling a bit nervous, but to my surprise she said she\u2019d drive the whole way. She did however mention a couple of times that I \u201cneed to not be me today\u201d \u2013 I am quite a nervous passenger and can easily feel unsafe.\nThe drive out went ok, although she misjudged how close we were to the side of the road a couple of times. On the way back she\u2019s saying she feels quite confident in the car and that she knows how wide it is. I kept quiet at this point hoping not to dampen her confidence.\nWe get closer to home and she goes a different way, asked me to Google the route. I direct her but again she decides to do her own thing and takes us down a single track road.\nWe\u2019re driving along and she clips the mirror again. At this point I say \u201cyou\u2019ve just hit that bush with the mirror. If it looks close to you then it\u2019s double close for me\u201d. She starts laughing at me, no idea why, and I have to tell her I\u2019m being serious. \nWe carry on a bit and there\u2019s potholes. Then all of a sudden she steers the car left and scrapes it down the bushes for maybe 5-10 metres. I could hear it scraping the side of the car loads. I didn\u2019t react the best, put my hand in the air and shouted \u201cyou\u2019re too fucking close\u201d.\nShe explained that there was a massive pothole about 4 foot across and she was swerving round it. I kinda digested that for a bit and apologised for shouting at her.\nWe reach a garden centre and look at the side of the car. It\u2019s got tons of scratches down the whole passenger side. She apologises and says she\u2019ll pay for it to be polished out.\nShe nips into a garden centre and I\u2019m kinda still processing the whole thing, so by the time she gets back I\u2019m obviously grumpy. She reiterates that she was trying to avoid the pothole to avoid damaging tyre/suspension/steering and keeping us safe in doing so. I told her I don\u2019t think I would have done the same since those things can all be replaced and usually fairly cheaply. I also asked her why she didn\u2019t break and go over the pothole really slowly but she said she didn\u2019t see it in time. She then gets upset with me and refuses to drive home and has been getting upset with me ever since saying she never wanted to do that drive and that she\u2019s never driving with me as a passenger in that car again.\nI\u2019m baffled because you\u2019re unlikely to ruin suspension etc on 1 pothole, especially in an SUV. And on the tyre front, they are literally made to be replaced so I would have just changed the wheel.", "created_utc": 1682958791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134rbvh/aita_for_being_annoyed_that_my_wife_scratched_our/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's also going to cost a hell of a lot less to get a few scratches buffed out than it would to replace a tire, fix your suspension, or what have you.

She made a mistake and said she'd pay for it. YTA", "YTA\n\nShe was driving responsibly. Bushes are far less likely to do serious damage than the pothole. If she bent a rim that's usually hundreds of dollars for the rim on top of the cost for a new tire.", "YTA. Christ. You\u2019re making me anxious.

Scratches in the paint of a not brand new car are less impactful on the function of the car than if it is rallied across too many potholes. Blowing a tire is going to require immediate repair whereas scratches aren't changing how the car operates. I would think it was a N-A-H situation if you didn't cuss her out while she was driving and already acknowledge it was inappropriate. \n\nPeople have different priorities while driving, my husband's dad is convinced the appropriate action if you're being cut off/run into a curb is to let the car hit you so they're libel rather than risking a solo incident ruining your suspension by hitting the curb to avoid collision. I think most sane people would pick avoiding collision as a safer choice than letting someone hit you, just as not running into a pothole is safer even at the expense of the paint.", "YTA, and it seems you're borderline abusive. Also, hitting a pothole can do significant structural damage to the vehicle. Scratches are just cosmetic.", "YTA. Scratches are cosmetic, damage to the suspension and so forth effect the function of the car. \n\nIt seems clear that your wife is not actually anxious about driving in general, but about driving with you as a passenger.", "YTA. Buffing out scratches is a hell of a lot cheaper than a new tire and with you in the car I'm guessing a fucking race car driver would have issues.\n\nI'm guessing you'll be on the couch for quite a while", "YTA. She's thinking about safety; you're thinking about cost and cosmetics. \n\n'She apologises and says she\u2019ll pay for it to be polished out.'\n\nWhat more do you want from her?

And on the tyre front, they are literally made to be replaced so I would have just changed the wheel'\n\n1 pothole can absolutely damage the suspension; they can take a tyre out, cause accidents. I'd take a bush over a pothole anyday.", "INFO: How long have you been together? Was it an arranged marriage? What is your sex life like? Does it even exist?", "YTA. Some scrapes are just cosmetic and easily taken care of. Damaging a rim or suspension components would be much worse.", "YTA. Either be a passenger or drive.", "Sir it's just a car", "YTA but not that much of one but it seems like your critiquing your wife's driving to much it was a mistake and people make mistakes", "YTA for treating her like that. Especially since she already has anxiety. Driving is hard enough without someone screaming down your neck. So STFU or drive yourself. \n\nYou think riding with your wife is hard?

Also, you're so wrong about how easy it is to replace tires, suspension, etc.  Those are all expensive fixes, especially compared to some measly paint scratches. Your wife sounds like a fine driver, but from this alone I'd hate to be in a car with you in any capacity", "YTA. You're a total, massive asshole. It's literally impossible to focus on driving while someone's constantly criticizing you.

Had she done that, you'd have gone at her twice as bad.", "YTA for your reaction. You weren\u2019t wrong about going slowly over potholes, if it\u2019s big enough that she\u2019s driving through bushes to avoid it, it\u2019s big enough that she should have seen it and slowed down to drive over it. But maybe you need to get her more of a beater car? Just so you don\u2019t have to get so worked up over the cosmetic damage she\u2019s likely to inflict on it. But your reaction was over the top and with her anxiety, you are only adding to the problem.", "You are pretty judgmental for someone that obviously knows nothing about car maintenance, safety, driving, or communicating in an adult relationship.

Yes tires can be replaced but you hit a pothole just bloody right and you crack something under the hood that's important! Potholes are worse than some scratches on a car! I'm with her! I'd scratch my car to hell over hitting any sort of potholes!\n\nAlso you can damage the tires, rims, axel etc even your brakes can be damaged by potholes. And those are NOT cheap fixes! And in extreme cases you can total your car via pothole. \n\nAlso. You give off nervous energy which makes her nervous. I'm curious how she'd be without you in the car.", "Yeah i would kicked you the fuck out of the car if i was your wifle ngl G.

Better she is driving to appointments and grocery shopping alone the next weeks.", "NTA - she shouldn't be driving...if she didn't see the pothole she's not paying attention. If it's daytime and she didn't see it, she's not paying attention. Why in the world would she go a different way home, ask for you to google the directions but completely go somewhere else??? This type of driving is a recipe for disaster. A fender bender. A head on collision if she's swerving all over the road. Or worse if she gets too close to parked cars but claims she knows how wide the vehicle is....", "NTA because this is all just hinky as hell. On a single track road a 4 foot by 5 meter long pothole is impossible to miss and frankly seems impossible to avoid. Also she specifically chose that road in particular after deviating vrom the regular route home twice when she asked to drive. I would be asking her what this really is about since from someone who has rode down dozens of rural one track roads, this appears more like she messed up the car on purpose for some reason.", "Yta and exhausting, get some therapy.", "YTA \nWhy are you do treat your poor wife so badly?\n\nI feel so sorry for her", "INFO have you ever damaged or scratched a car?", "YTA your nagging a commenting has made me anxious just reading your story. I bought a brand new car. The 1st day I took it to work someone dinged it in the parking garage. Shit happens. Plus you are offloading from the sound of things. I would just buy a beater for that type of driving, or get a proper off road car that is lifted with a suspension to match or an off road truck. I own the car, it doesn't own me.", "YTA. Take the bus. I would toss you out.", "YTA and the reason she\u2019s so anxious.", "YTA \nYou\u2019re basically saying damaging the car with a pothole is better than superficial scratches which DOES NOT effect the way the car drives, making the car remain safe.\nYou say your wife struggles with anxiety \u2026 can you blame her????", "YTA... your post gave me anxiety! I can't imagine having you as a passenger. Light scraps from braches will polish out with normal car polish.", "YTA and you're the problem. \n\nCan't imagine anyone likes driving you any where.", "YTA.

This is what you are doing to your wife, you will make her an anxious driver.", "YTA.   I also feel you are close to abusive with this behaviour.  Maybe you should leave her to drive and catch an uber", "YTA. Omg you sound so exhausting to drive with. I don\u2019t blame your wife. I wouldn\u2019t want to drive with you either.
