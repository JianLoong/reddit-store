Got a 4 year old car in great condition.\nCollected the car 2 days ago. My wife said a few times that when she first drives the car she wants it to be in a quiet area \u2013 she struggles with anxiety in general.\nWe set off this morning and I\u2019m already feeling a bit nervous, but to my surprise she said she\u2019d drive the whole way. She did however mention a couple of times that I \u201cneed to not be me today\u201d \u2013 I am quite a nervous passenger and can easily feel unsafe.\nThe drive out went ok, although she misjudged how close we were to the side of the road a couple of times. On the way back she\u2019s saying she feels quite confident in the car and that she knows how wide it is. I kept quiet at this point hoping not to dampen her confidence.\nWe get closer to home and she goes a different way, asked me to Google the route. I direct her but again she decides to do her own thing and takes us down a single track road.\nWe\u2019re driving along and she clips the mirror again. At this point I say \u201cyou\u2019ve just hit that bush with the mirror. If it looks close to you then it\u2019s double close for me\u201d. She starts laughing at me, no idea why, and I have to tell her I\u2019m being serious. \nWe carry on a bit and there\u2019s potholes. Then all of a sudden she steers the car left and scrapes it down the bushes for maybe 5-10 metres. I could hear it scraping the side of the car loads. I didn\u2019t react the best, put my hand in the air and shouted \u201cyou\u2019re too fucking close\u201d.\nShe explained that there was a massive pothole about 4 foot across and she was swerving round it. I kinda digested that for a bit and apologised for shouting at her.\nWe reach a garden centre and look at the side of the car. It\u2019s got tons of scratches down the whole passenger side. She apologises and says she\u2019ll pay for it to be polished out.\nShe nips into a garden centre and I\u2019m kinda still processing the whole thing, so by the time she gets back I\u2019m obviously grumpy. She reiterates that she was trying to avoid the pothole to avoid damaging tyre/suspension/steering and keeping us safe in doing so. I told her I don\u2019t think I would have done the same since those things can all be replaced and usually fairly cheaply. I also asked her why she didn\u2019t break and go over the pothole really slowly but she said she didn\u2019t see it in time. She then gets upset with me and refuses to drive home and has been getting upset with me ever since saying she never wanted to do that drive and that she\u2019s never driving with me as a passenger in that car again.\nI\u2019m baffled because you\u2019re unlikely to ruin suspension etc on 1 pothole, especially in an SUV. And on the tyre front, they are literally made to be replaced so I would have just changed the wheel.", "created_utc": 1682958791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134rbvh/aita_for_being_annoyed_that_my_wife_scratched_our/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you want a car to be driven the precise way you want, buy a car that's just for you and not for \"family\".\n\nAnd, either drive or don't bother the driver. Pick one.", "ESH she's a bad driver and you're an anxious partner.", "INFO: would you seriously rather have suspension damage than a superficial scratch? And how bad was the pothole? Some potholes can wreck the undercarriage/wheels/suspension/etc. \n\nBecause frankly it doesn\u2019t really sound like your wife is the only one with anxiety. Kinda sounds like you went into this on edge expecting your wife to mess up (which is usually palpable, by the way) and projected it onto her until she did \u201cmess up\u201d somehow. In short, it\u2019s a high level reaction to a low level infraction fueled by confirmation bias and *your* anxiety.", "YTA. We bought a nice new car a few years ago and within weeks my husband misjudged the pole in our parking garage space and majorly scraped up the side. He was devastated and you know what I didn\u2019t do? Make him feel worse. It\u2019s just a car. Be nice to your wife.", "So, your wife has anxiety, you are a nervous passenger. Buy 2 vehicles.", "I feel like polishing the scratches out is cheaper than replacing tires, suspension and all of that. Keep your mouth shut and your complaints to yourself, because all you\u2019re doing is making things worse for her. You are 10000000% the asshole. Let your wife drive in peace.", "YTA. Someone doesn\u2019t know how expensive suspension repair and tires are. You sound insufferable.", "Yta.  We bought our first brand spanking new car in 2018 after years of buying junkers.  I scratched it as he was signing the papers,  he didn't even flinch lol", "YTA, kinda\u2026 but a few things. OP says wife is anxious and clearly not a confident driver. Nor to rant, but I am so sick of twats buying cars they cannot drive. OP\u2019s wife wants an SUV, which is great, because if your a shit driver, then at least you have more car to kill with. If you have issues with distance, awareness and judgement, buy a small car, fuck me. OP buys car without wife test driving, thats stupid. Add into the mix that you need google to get home\u2026?!?! tells me that both driver and passenger are fixed in a screen, not the road, if you cant drive properly, why add a distraction to it. Again, fuck me! Suddenly steers to avoid massive pothole\u2026 did either of you not see it? Have OP and partner got a real license? Are they both legally blind? It is truely morons like this that get ppl killed. Buy an Aygo, or get a bus pass.", "YTA. My God man get some help.", "Not quite sure I understand all the Y T A s here. Like she drove into something and damaged the car the first time she drove it whilst swerving to avoid something she should\u2019ve seen, she obviously isn\u2019t a good driver. Driving down an unknown route in an unfamiliar vehicle she should\u2019ve been going at a speed that she saw the pothole in time to go over it slowly, especially if it was huge. And I don\u2019t know what everyone is on about, paintwork is horrendously expensive to get fixed. I brushed against a hedge that I didn\u2019t realise had rocks in it one time and the dent and scratched paintwork from it can\u2019t have been more than 2x2 inches and I was quoted upwards of \u00a31,000 to fix it. I dread to think what the full side of the car would be. I\u2019m also not a nervous passenger unless I\u2019m in the car with someone who is objectively a bad driver, in which case it\u2019s sort of impossible not to say something sometimes. I would say ESH at best, because he could\u2019ve handled it better but based on the information given I wonder if his wife should really be driving if her anxiety and reactions are that bad.", "As I told my ex husband when I bought a new SUV, if I didn\u2019t want dings and scratches on my vehicle I would put it in a museum.", "YTA and you clearly no shit about cars. The suspension is not easier or cheaper to replace than a buff repair job on paint. \n\nChrist you need anger management.", "YTA even reading this stresses me out. The only way I would drive with you in the car was, if you were in the boot, gagged", "I'm sure if she had hit the pothole and damaged the tire or suspension he would've been just as mad, he just wants to pretend it would've been fine. There's no pleasing this man.", "Wanna know how to buff out light scratches like that? I shit you not, Mr. Clean magic eraser (or other equivalent) and a spray bottle of water for lubrication. Literally less than $15, and less than an hour of work. Fucking *easy.*", "Had this happen to me. I got a blow torch and 4lb sledge hammer and just beat it back into shape myself. Didn\u2019t even take the tire off. Took me and a friend about 20 minutes.", "Seriously... \"She struggles with anxiety.\" I wonder why...", "Right! Sounds more OP is the one struggling with anxiety.", "Driven a couple annoying backseat drivers before. \n\nSome of them learned to keep it in a bit more, but even when they don\u2019t talk you can just feel anxiety radiating from them", "For real, he sounds controlling - no wonder she\u2019s nervous about driving.\n\nI have friends who like to be backseat drivers for no reason and micromanage everything from speed to lane changes the moment they\u2019re in the car and it\u2019s easy to remedy in that case - I ask them to drive their car and I don\u2019t offer to drive them anymore.", "It's not the physically safer choice, but it is the financially safe choice. Your father in law has a point.", "Maybe he can sleep in his precious new car.", "This", "Honestly, speaking as someone who *does* own a sports car, I'd choose bushes over a massive pothole any day. I ride low to the ground and a bad enough pothole could fuck up my undercarriage along with the suspension, tires, and scraping the front bumper. At least an SUV probably won't bottom out going into or coming out of the pothole.", "Same. I hated driving with mine because he would carry on like a drama queen and wonder why I would be so nervous the entire time", "what is that way of thinking ? she has her licence she can drive if she wants to", "That's nice, but not really relevant. For one thing, lots of people don't have a handy blow torch. For another, if you fuck up the rim, it's probably now jacked up enough that a body shop can't hammer it back into place either.", "Also? You can safely drive home with scratched paint.", "Yeah my husband is a mechanic and if all those things need fixing (new tire, alignment, steering wheel column replaced, ball joints replaced) that's a few thousand dollars easy. \n\nDefinitely voting YTA.", "There are literally tiktoks showing how you can buff scratches at home w shit you have.\n\nI def can't fix an alignment issue at home much less the suspension\n\nYta", "Real \"Spend $5 to save \u00a225\" kind of thinking", "I had assumed he was talking about the tyre rather than the suspension and steering, at presumably slow single track (non rally driving ) speeds I wouldnt have thought a pothole would damage those on a modern suv\n\nThen again she said she couldnt stop in time so potentially going too fast for the road.\n\nThough op, you're  probably TA here, if you're both anxious in a car it wasn't a good idea to go out together, she should have gone and gotten some solo time to build confidence without you panicking beside her.\n\n(I say this as someone who is a nightmare to drive with as I get pretty bad anxiety in the front passenger seat, much better in the back)", "I wonder if she actually \"struggles w anxiety\" or just hates driving w him in the car. Sounds more like he struggles w anxiety and has chosen to make that everyone's problem.", "Agreed. I expect people to speak up if I ever make a mistake and am doing something dangerous. Like if someone tailgates, is merging and not seeing someone there, or is doing something else that is dangerous, I\u2019m going to tell them. But to make such a big deal about this is ridiculous.", "True. I didn\u2019t even consider the low riding cars. I have a giant truck so I can basically run over anything.", "Relevant.  If you\u2019re gonna bring up the damage a pothole can do, then you need to know what the fuck you\u2019re talking about.", "Also if it was just bushes getting the car waxed will probably get them out,  don't even need a body job.", "yup...not for nothing, but if my choices are between something I can fix with nail polish or something that needs a mechanic...I'd scrape up the sides with enthusiasm! (Note that nail polish is not 'ideal' but if you need to cover with something to protect metal for a short period it'll do the job and is made to come off with a chemical later...)", "Oh, she definitely struggles with anxiety... HIS anxiety is a huge struggle for her.", "He never wrote that she struggles with her own anxiety...  Maybe he meant \"She struggles with my anxiety.\"", "I've never seen such a big fan of long strings of emojis.", "So you think the blow torch and hammer method is something most people or even a large fraction of people can or should try? Cause that's the only way this was relevant.", "Yes. If you are able bodied enough to swing the shit out of a 4lb hammer then you can do it. Also, you can get a 4 oz blow torch at Lowes for 20 bucks. I would call that having one handy.", "you literally expect people to be able to find a torch and hammer and fix the wheel themselves. what if they don't live near Lowes bud? what if they *aren't* able bodied? if you wanna troll, at least put in effort like... cmon"]}
