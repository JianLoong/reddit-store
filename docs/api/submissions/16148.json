Got a 4 year old car in great condition.\nCollected the car 2 days ago. My wife said a few times that when she first drives the car she wants it to be in a quiet area \u2013 she struggles with anxiety in general.\nWe set off this morning and I\u2019m already feeling a bit nervous, but to my surprise she said she\u2019d drive the whole way. She did however mention a couple of times that I \u201cneed to not be me today\u201d \u2013 I am quite a nervous passenger and can easily feel unsafe.\nThe drive out went ok, although she misjudged how close we were to the side of the road a couple of times. On the way back she\u2019s saying she feels quite confident in the car and that she knows how wide it is. I kept quiet at this point hoping not to dampen her confidence.\nWe get closer to home and she goes a different way, asked me to Google the route. I direct her but again she decides to do her own thing and takes us down a single track road.\nWe\u2019re driving along and she clips the mirror again. At this point I say \u201cyou\u2019ve just hit that bush with the mirror. If it looks close to you then it\u2019s double close for me\u201d. She starts laughing at me, no idea why, and I have to tell her I\u2019m being serious. \nWe carry on a bit and there\u2019s potholes. Then all of a sudden she steers the car left and scrapes it down the bushes for maybe 5-10 metres. I could hear it scraping the side of the car loads. I didn\u2019t react the best, put my hand in the air and shouted \u201cyou\u2019re too fucking close\u201d.\nShe explained that there was a massive pothole about 4 foot across and she was swerving round it. I kinda digested that for a bit and apologised for shouting at her.\nWe reach a garden centre and look at the side of the car. It\u2019s got tons of scratches down the whole passenger side. She apologises and says she\u2019ll pay for it to be polished out.\nShe nips into a garden centre and I\u2019m kinda still processing the whole thing, so by the time she gets back I\u2019m obviously grumpy. She reiterates that she was trying to avoid the pothole to avoid damaging tyre/suspension/steering and keeping us safe in doing so. I told her I don\u2019t think I would have done the same since those things can all be replaced and usually fairly cheaply. I also asked her why she didn\u2019t break and go over the pothole really slowly but she said she didn\u2019t see it in time. She then gets upset with me and refuses to drive home and has been getting upset with me ever since saying she never wanted to do that drive and that she\u2019s never driving with me as a passenger in that car again.\nI\u2019m baffled because you\u2019re unlikely to ruin suspension etc on 1 pothole, especially in an SUV. And on the tyre front, they are literally made to be replaced so I would have just changed the wheel.", "created_utc": 1682958791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134rbvh/aita_for_being_annoyed_that_my_wife_scratched_our/", "score": 693, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If scratches have gone through the clear into paint, then cutting is not the way to repair, you're right. But if they're light surface scratches, a gentle cut to bring the entire surface of the clear down to the level of the bottom of the scratches is exactly what a body shop would do, and there's no exposing stuff to the world that shouldn't be.

You're allowed to be annoyed that your new car got scratched, that sucks. \n\nYou are absolutely the asshole fro shouting at your wife and then getting annoyed at her because you \"think\" you would have done something differently. She was driving, not you, she made the judgement call, not you. She decided to risk some minor aesthetic damage to the paintwork of the car over the risk of suspension damage, a blow out tyre, or personal injury. That's her call to make, if you would have chosen something different then fine but she's not wrong just because she chose the safer option.   \nI completely understand why she doesn't want to drive with you in the car if you're going to not only backseat drive but then actively get loud and flail about when something happens that you don't like. that in itself could cause an accident. \n\nYTA", "my guy you sound like a nightmare passenger", "YTA - you sound obnoxious, and reading your post already makes me anxious from you. \n\nA pothole could have led to an accident or serious damage to the car.

Potholes are not a joke, is take scratches any day.", "\nTrue - if she is \u201canxious\u201d on the road in general, she needs to go back to driving school. Driving is an everyday task and you need to be that good enough at it, that nothing about this makes you nervous. If she is swerves around obstacles into other obstacles, she doesn\u2019t understand basic control of the car. If she doesn\u2019t see obstacles early enough, she is not driving at the right speed for the road conditions.\n\nYes, I can imagine that she suffers from her husbans behavior and that is why she gets so much sympathy here.

I was totally fine at driving, not nervous at all until I started dating him.\n\nHe used to tell me he could hear me panicking because \u201cmy breathing had changed\u201d when I came up to a junction. When in reality I was perfectly fine and HE was making me nervous.\n\nUsed to gasp in an overly dramatic way if other cars passed us in the next lane on the motorway. They were no way near us but he would grab his seat. Literally never had anyone react like that in my car before, not even my nervous mum who said she felt safe with me as opposed to with my Dad.\n\nApparently this guy used to do it to his ex wife as well as he told me how she had a go at him for things.\n\nThankfully no longer with him now.", "I am a great driver and I\u2019d accidentally hit a mailbox with this infectious black hole of neuroses in the passenger seat.

They also had no dealers in the area that installed this particular line, so I had them *shipped to me*. \n\nI am wholly uninterested in your opinion. I did extensive research, just like I did before I put tires on my Wrangler. \n\nI consciously made the right decision *for me.* You can rest your case all I want, but not your wallet, not your car, not your worry.
