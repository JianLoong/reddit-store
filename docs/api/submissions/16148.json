Got a 4 year old car in great condition.\nCollected the car 2 days ago. My wife said a few times that when she first drives the car she wants it to be in a quiet area \u2013 she struggles with anxiety in general.\nWe set off this morning and I\u2019m already feeling a bit nervous, but to my surprise she said she\u2019d drive the whole way. She did however mention a couple of times that I \u201cneed to not be me today\u201d \u2013 I am quite a nervous passenger and can easily feel unsafe.\nThe drive out went ok, although she misjudged how close we were to the side of the road a couple of times. On the way back she\u2019s saying she feels quite confident in the car and that she knows how wide it is. I kept quiet at this point hoping not to dampen her confidence.\nWe get closer to home and she goes a different way, asked me to Google the route. I direct her but again she decides to do her own thing and takes us down a single track road.\nWe\u2019re driving along and she clips the mirror again. At this point I say \u201cyou\u2019ve just hit that bush with the mirror. If it looks close to you then it\u2019s double close for me\u201d. She starts laughing at me, no idea why, and I have to tell her I\u2019m being serious. \nWe carry on a bit and there\u2019s potholes. Then all of a sudden she steers the car left and scrapes it down the bushes for maybe 5-10 metres. I could hear it scraping the side of the car loads. I didn\u2019t react the best, put my hand in the air and shouted \u201cyou\u2019re too fucking close\u201d.\nShe explained that there was a massive pothole about 4 foot across and she was swerving round it. I kinda digested that for a bit and apologised for shouting at her.\nWe reach a garden centre and look at the side of the car. It\u2019s got tons of scratches down the whole passenger side. She apologises and says she\u2019ll pay for it to be polished out.\nShe nips into a garden centre and I\u2019m kinda still processing the whole thing, so by the time she gets back I\u2019m obviously grumpy. She reiterates that she was trying to avoid the pothole to avoid damaging tyre/suspension/steering and keeping us safe in doing so. I told her I don\u2019t think I would have done the same since those things can all be replaced and usually fairly cheaply. I also asked her why she didn\u2019t break and go over the pothole really slowly but she said she didn\u2019t see it in time. She then gets upset with me and refuses to drive home and has been getting upset with me ever since saying she never wanted to do that drive and that she\u2019s never driving with me as a passenger in that car again.\nI\u2019m baffled because you\u2019re unlikely to ruin suspension etc on 1 pothole, especially in an SUV. And on the tyre front, they are literally made to be replaced so I would have just changed the wheel.", "created_utc": 1682958791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134rbvh/aita_for_being_annoyed_that_my_wife_scratched_our/", "score": 215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
