Also, history is the best class, no doubt.", "NTA. As a high school student if I was failing a class having my parents limit my screen time and get me a tutor would be the normal thing to do.", "NTA.\n\nWhen my kiddo was in HS, their grades dropped to failing. I checked the online grade thingy, saw their grades dropping. Was like wtf? Asked kiddo what was up. Kiddo claimed the teacher hadn't entered end of term grades yet. I emailed the teacher, who confirmed end of term grades were not entered and the gradebook did not necessarily reflect current student performance. So I relaxed. A few weeks later, end of term grades are posted and lo and behold: my kid is failing.\n\nSo I instituted a household policy that because the teachers sometimes took a few days/ weeks to finish grading and updating the online gradebook, my kiddo had to maintain a B average in the online gradebook, which they were capable of doing if they did the bare minimum of their work and turned in their assignments. If it dropped below that,  it would be because they had missed an assignment. No more scrambling to make up a term's worth of work at the end of the grading term. \n\nTo enforce this policy, I turned off the data to my kid's phone whenever their grades dropped below a B, and used the parental controls to lock down access to the household WiFi so my kid was only allowed to use the Internet in the living room on a school laptop for homework related purposes.\n\nMy kid hated this policy. LOATHED it. Said it was unfair, cruel, and unusual punishment. Said I was a bad mom who did not love them. My husband expressed doubt as well -- perhaps, he suggested, we could give kiddo internet on the weekends. I doubted myself, tbh. But we had struggled through freshman and half of sophomore year with my kid doing this procrastination song and dance where they would lose or forget or not turn in assignments they were perfectly capable of doing; nearly fail a class; then spend the last two weeks of the quarter running around like a stressed bat out of hell making up all the work they'd missed. It wasn't fair to us, the teachers, or my kid. \n\nSo I stuck to my guns and refused to cave. I told my kid I did love them, but I was their mom first and foremost, and they needed help with this growth process. I told my husband when he was handling the fallout from the school and kiddo, he could handle the discipline for this issue, but until then, he could help me by presenting a united front. And I stuck to my guns. \n\nIt paid off. My kid started turning in work to keep their grades up and access to data/ Internet on. On one occasion, my kid forewarned me of a grade drop due to a substitute giving an autograded pop quiz on a unit they hadn't been taught, and showed me the steps they had taken to address the grade drop (sent an email to their teacher regarding the pop quiz and requesting an extra credit assignment to make up the point drop. The teacher thanked them for being proactive and said the quiz would be removed from their grade, but the system took time to update).\n\nMy kid graduated a few years ago, and they have specifically brought up that disagreement and my handling of it to thank me a few times since then. My kiddo says while they didn't like it at the time, in retrospect, they appreciate how the enforced accountability helped them learn to manage their time and communicate with their teachers -- both skills which have helped them in the workplace. \n\nSo I would say do it. You're not parenting as a popularity contest. You're parenting to teach your kid valuable skills -- like accountability and time management.", "I rather doubt screen time is the problem if this Is the only class she's failing", "Nta.

You don\u2019t do this abysmally with an honest, well-intentioned effort. This has to be the result of entire missing assignments and making no attempt to absorb the material. I don\u2019t think tutoring is really the solution, there\u2019s an attitude problem to address about school as a priority in general.", "oops lol sorry i forgot to add that part but she said she doesnt think history is the subject for her.", "I say fuck a lot it\u2019s not personal. ffs is more pc", "Well, if it\u2019s a requirement to graduate from high school, it IS the subject for her and she needs to get her butt in gear and start studying.  \n\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing, but you may need to go a step further.  No Homecoming or any other highly desired activities unless she\u2019s caught up on all assignments in all classes.  Check the online grade book, and if you see missing assignments, email the teacher(s) to see if they are really missing or simply ungraded at this time.  Repeat with any other high-value activities until she figures it out.\n\n(Retired high school teacher here.  I had a stepson try this.  We took away hunting\u2014his favorite activity\u2014if he had any missing assignments the day before the expedition.  It only had to happen once and he stopped having missing assignments; he figured out he had to turn them in by Tuesday for them to get graded and online before his dad checked the grade book.  You can right this ship, but you need your husband on board.  Go over high school graduation requirements with him.  Let him see that she\u2019s going to have to pass this class or she\u2019s going to end up in summer school doing it again.  I\u2019m assuming she\u2019s not college-bound.  If she thinks she is, have her figure out her current GPA, look at the entrance requirements for potential colleges, and let her see for herself that her current choices will not help her down the road.)", "No worries, I\u2019ve done that many times, lol\n\nI\u2019m gonna say NTA, then.", "sure but that doesnt mean she can fail it as it affects her future. Heck i had latin and hated the language... it was absolutely useless because i work in tech", "History may not be the subject she most enjoys, but is one of the most IMPORTANT. History is a direct reflection of how we as a society has come to function. The wars, the civil rights movements for women and POC, she needs to know this. It will only be detrimental to her if she doesn't. Only the most idiotic, uneducated, rubes, don't have a respect for history."]}
