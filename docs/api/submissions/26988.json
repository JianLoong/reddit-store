Also, history is the best class, no doubt.", "NTA. As a high school student if I was failing a class having my parents limit my screen time and get me a tutor would be the normal thing to do.", "NTA.\n\nWhen my kiddo was in HS, their grades dropped to failing. I checked the online grade thingy, saw their grades dropping. Was like wtf? Asked kiddo what was up. Kiddo claimed the teacher hadn't entered end of term grades yet. I emailed the teacher, who confirmed end of term grades were not entered and the gradebook did not necessarily reflect current student performance. So I relaxed. A few weeks later, end of term grades are posted and lo and behold: my kid is failing.\n\nSo I instituted a household policy that because the teachers sometimes took a few days/ weeks to finish grading and updating the online gradebook, my kiddo had to maintain a B average in the online gradebook, which they were capable of doing if they did the bare minimum of their work and turned in their assignments. If it dropped below that,  it would be because they had missed an assignment. No more scrambling to make up a term's worth of work at the end of the grading term. \n\nTo enforce this policy, I turned off the data to my kid's phone whenever their grades dropped below a B, and used the parental controls to lock down access to the household WiFi so my kid was only allowed to use the Internet in the living room on a school laptop for homework related purposes.\n\nMy kid hated this policy. LOATHED it. Said it was unfair, cruel, and unusual punishment. Said I was a bad mom who did not love them. My husband expressed doubt as well -- perhaps, he suggested, we could give kiddo internet on the weekends. I doubted myself, tbh. But we had struggled through freshman and half of sophomore year with my kid doing this procrastination song and dance where they would lose or forget or not turn in assignments they were perfectly capable of doing; nearly fail a class; then spend the last two weeks of the quarter running around like a stressed bat out of hell making up all the work they'd missed. It wasn't fair to us, the teachers, or my kid. \n\nSo I stuck to my guns and refused to cave. I told my kid I did love them, but I was their mom first and foremost, and they needed help with this growth process. I told my husband when he was handling the fallout from the school and kiddo, he could handle the discipline for this issue, but until then, he could help me by presenting a united front. And I stuck to my guns. \n\nIt paid off. My kid started turning in work to keep their grades up and access to data/ Internet on. On one occasion, my kid forewarned me of a grade drop due to a substitute giving an autograded pop quiz on a unit they hadn't been taught, and showed me the steps they had taken to address the grade drop (sent an email to their teacher regarding the pop quiz and requesting an extra credit assignment to make up the point drop. The teacher thanked them for being proactive and said the quiz would be removed from their grade, but the system took time to update).\n\nMy kid graduated a few years ago, and they have specifically brought up that disagreement and my handling of it to thank me a few times since then. My kiddo says while they didn't like it at the time, in retrospect, they appreciate how the enforced accountability helped them learn to manage their time and communicate with their teachers -- both skills which have helped them in the workplace. \n\nSo I would say do it. You're not parenting as a popularity contest. You're parenting to teach your kid valuable skills -- like accountability and time management.\n\nEta: forgot to add: At the time I was doing this stuff, the research on social media impact and phone usage for teens, as well as well as parental supervision was still being gathered. Now it is in. Fellow parents: 90% of parents self-report as not restricting or checking in on their kid's data and cell phone use. WE NEED TO STOP THAT for teens. Data is Internet, and teens need to be taught Internet safety. From you, their parents. Start checking their phone usage. Start looking at the most popular app downloads.

Is there a medical condition creating difficulty? Is something more going on?\n\nIt's not remotely enough to simply hope limited screen time solves a problem. It's not enough to hope a tutor or anyone else could possibly know everything going on in a child's life. With a student scoring that low in history, you are missing something. And that can be far too many things to speculate on. Meet with the school counselor to find what sources you need to employ to address your child's education. You need to be more involved in this. And if your spouse is saying the child doesn't need tutoring, yet is not discussing what needs to change, then not being a parent is also part of the problem.\n\nI'm an autistic woman, an educator, and a mother. My answer may come across as brutal because I am so direct. I'm also not wrong in my assessment. You need to involve more resources, and be more involved.

I\u2019m betting that if you or your husband chose not to perform at work, eventually it will have some kind of affect on your paycheck.

That gives the impression of a mental health crisis, especially combined with her completely shutting down whenever you broach the subject.\n\nGetting her tutoring, including insisting she actually attend, is an unequivocally good decision - but 16 is only two years away from legal adulthood, and it's way too old for the \"do what I say or else\" authoritarian parenting tactic to be in any way effective. You need to communicate rather than just doling out consequences, and you also need to get your husband in line. Having one parent be \"the easy going one\" is unhealthy and unsustainable. He should have been more concerned about her grades. The fact that they ganged up against you to shut down your intervention reeks of an toxic family dynamic.

It's possible that a tutor and a screen time limit is exactly what she needs, but it sounds like you didn't talk to her at all? \n\nIf she has some kind of obstacle to her learning, it would be MUCH more sensible to find out what it is and deal with it than just applying a one-size-fits-all punitive solution.", "NTA Nowadays everyone especially the younger generation will be distracted by TikTok or social media. It's better to limit her activities online. Her dad is too lenient.", "Means she just isn't doing anything.

Mind you though - in this case? At most, the teacher might just be a contributing factor to the problem.

Like, for example, the test questions ask them shit like \"At what time were the church bells rung as the Cry of Dolores was made?\" or \"Who was the King of India mentioned on line 1256 of The Knight's Tale?\" \n\nNow mind you - in this case?

I had tons of missing assignments in high school, but between attendance, test scores, and the few assignments I did do, it was enough to keep my grades just barely above failing. Had a teacher let me make up as many missing assignments as I could at the end of the year once so he could pass me my senior year (ironically my history class), at a steep mark down, but even getting a 5-10/20 instead of a 0/20 made a huge difference, and bumped me enough past the threshold to pass the class.

There's also a thread of literary studies known as historical materialism led by Stephen Greenblatt who loves to analyze Shakespeare's works through the lens of Elizabethan history and culture.\n\nThese days, social and micro histories are being done which means that there should be something out there to spark just about anyone's interest.\n\nBut honestly, History in High School teaches a common core of beliefs that are generally shared across society.
