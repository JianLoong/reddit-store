For context, she and my dad had me when they were both 16 years old. Despite everyone telling her that they would support her no matter what she decided to do about me, she wanted to keep me. I later found out from an old mutual friend of hers and my dad\u2019s that she only kept me because she viewed me as a mealticket to get her every want and whim paid for by my paternal grandparents who are wealthy. After my birth she moved in with my dad so they could both raise me with the help of my grandparents. When it became apparent that my grandparents weren\u2019t going to be treated like her personal bank accounts despite offering to pay for her university education, car and baby stuff for me and that my grandma wasn\u2019t going to be quiet and let her shirk all of her responsibilities onto my dad, she decided to split claiming she couldn\u2019t deal with the pressures of raising a child anymore and she left to go university in France. I haven\u2019t seen her since. My maternal grandparents have been present in my life but their interest in me dwindled when they had other grandkids and now I only see them on special occasions. \n\nEarlier this week I got a message on Facebook from my mother\u2019s 16 year old daughter. This didn\u2019t blindside me as I was aware my mother had gone on to get married and have other kids with her husband that she met at university. The gist of her message was that she also knew I existed and that she planned to come to the UK (where I live) and that she wanted to meet me and in her message was a lot of crap about how my mother missed me and never wanted to leave me but she had to get out of the \u201ctoxic\u201d environment my dad had created. I didn\u2019t respond to her because I didn\u2019t know how to word my refusal without it coming across as harsh. I\u2019ll admit it wasn\u2019t the best move. \n\nShe told my maternal grandparents that I hadn\u2019t responded to her and yesterday they called me asking why and said that I really should meet her as she\u2019s family and it would be good for her to know her sister. I told them I didn\u2019t want to meet her or my other half-sibling and while I understood they weren\u2019t at fault for my mother abandoning me, I wasn\u2019t going to open myself up her or her family, since she\u2019s been lying to her kids about my dad. I pointed out that people with sperm donor fathers aren\u2019t put under pressure to meet half-siblings they might have and that I view my mother as an egg donor. This didn\u2019t go over well and they called me selfish and spoiled, suggested I was too used to the only child life and that I was ruining any chance my half-sister had of knowing her flesh and blood. I told them to figure out how to tell her I wouldn\u2019t be meeting her and hung up.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m an asshole for not wanting to meet her because at the end of the day, she is just a teenage girl and an innocent party in this.

In your place I would consider meeting her - not as \"family\" but because I would want to know what she had to say and what my siblings were doing like.

Where was your grandparent\u2019s \u201cbut you\u2019re family\u201d nonsense when your egg donor abandoned you? Or all the subsequent years she chose to have nothing to do with you? \n\nThe fact they\u2019re trying to insult and hurt you to do what they want is appalling. Not hard to see where your egg donor got her selfishness and lack of morals. \n\nDon\u2019t let these people make you feel guilty, they clearly do not care about what\u2019s best for you.

I\u2019d add that given the extremely negative views she\u2019s expressed about by your dad and his parents, despite having never met them, and the trauma you experienced by being mistreated and abandoned by your mom at a young age, you don\u2019t think it would be fruitful to meet or correspond further.

You have no obligation to meet anyone you don't want to, and based on what she said about your mother missing you, it sounds like maybe your half-sister is reaching out at your mother's urging.\n\nThat said, it was a bit of an AH move to not respond at all. You should've waited to write a reply after you calmed down and then had a friend look it over to make sure you weren't being harsh before sending it. And the way you talked to your grandparents was *very* harsh. You have good reason to view your mother as an egg donor, but you were saying this to *her parents*. All you needed to say was \"She abandoned me, so I'm not interested in being in touch with my half-siblings. I know you feel differently, but this is my decision.\"", "NTA.\n\nIf your half sister didn't have any ulterior motives, you ignoring her message would have been the end of it.\n\nI mean, what reason could possibly exist that your 16 year old half sister would suddenly reach out after all these years, AND be pushy enough to involve your maternal grandparents who then called you and shamed you?\n\n  \nMoney.", "NAH your choice.

Who knows.", "[deleted]", "nta, looks like half sis takes after mom in the selfish department.", "NTA They abandoned you and are just reaching out randomly. It is likely for their own gain like money. Honestly you don\u2019t have to have a relationship with someone you do not want to meet or see. Don\u2019t let them try to force you into a relationship you do not want. Good luck as they will likely keep trying to push this relationship.", "This is my thought as well.  Sister is just a teenager but\u2014she could have expressed interest and excitement over meeting OP without talking trash about OP\u2019s dad.\n\nAnd I really don\u2019t get the maternal grandparents guilt trip either.  Half sister is SIXTEEN and clearly has never met OP?  And suddenly OP is the villain here?  What is the angle or reasoning for that?  Clearly the relationship hasn\u2019t been a priority until now.", "She was very drunk at a NYE party my dad was having and she had asked if I was in touch with my mother and when I told her no, she told me that it didn\u2019t surprise her and went on to tell me that.

Maybe the truth lies somewhere in the middle.", "But she still dragged her side of the story into the relationship on day 1 and that disqualifies her in my view. She could have just texted that she wants to meet, instead she praised the mother and spoke ill of the father - whom she never met. She\u2019s 16, not 6, I wouldn\u2019t meet her because I don\u2019t need that kind of person in my life. You know she already not only has opinions about this, but is also preachy enough to bring it up unwarranted, it\u2019s not crazy to make deductions about some obvious aspects of her character  from this. NTA.", "The problem is that this step sibling is very likely a (perhaps unwitting) flying monkey for the estranged mom. Given what the girl said about how much mom is great and wants to know you I would be very suspicious that there is more to this reaching out than just to connect with a family member.", "It was a friend of my dad\u2019s that I don\u2019t even see anymore. Even my maternal grandparents admit that my mother was in the wrong and behaved terribly towards me and my dad. There was one time when I was a year old when she dropped me off with my maternal grandparents saying it was only going to be for a few hours, then proceeded to go on a bender with her friends for two days without getting in touch with anyone the entire time. I know you mean well, but not every woman is the victim and some of them are just shitty mothers.", "NTA. You\u2019re not obligated to meet other people.  And there was nothing wrong with ignoring the FB request.   You don\u2019t owe these people anything and are not obligated to undergo stress, trying to politely refuse something that you never asked for in the first place.", "BS. She obviously had her on motives for telling you. Being drunk is no excuse.", "There are always three sides to a relationship story: his side, her side, and the truth. \n\nNowadays that can be modernized to any gender roles you'd like.", "That is why OP should have her guard up.", "Idk, I don\u2019t see her around much anymore that happened when I was 19."]}
