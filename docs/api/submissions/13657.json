You could easily be forced into the position of having to tell her the unvarnished truth about your mom. That or be forced to sit there and listen to her spewing lies unknowingly.\n\nSome 16s might be mature enough to hear the truth about a parent. But many are not going to be.

Better to seen as not wanting to get to know them than the sorts of labels that might applied because you told the truth.\n\nHalf-sister isn't an A, just clueless.

But at the same time, that you even mentioned it speaks to how much you noticed the shift.\n\nA bigger issue is the way they came at you over the visit. All they should have done was listen to why you didn't respond and either offer to relay a polite decline or give advice on how to do so yourself.\n\nThey know the history, and even if they do not agree, they should respect your disinterest. Which they are clearly not doing. In fact, their position in this was pretty clearly favoring your mother.\n\nFirst, with justifications about why you should do it that were all centered on your half-sister. That it would be good for **her** to know her sister. That you were ruining it for **her**. It doesn't sound like they even tried to suggest some way that it would be good for you.\n\nSecond, with the name calling. Is it selfish to not want to have anything to do with a parent that abbandoned you or their new family? Maybe. But I'd call it putting your personal best interest ahead of people you don't know and have no desire to know.\n\nAnd the \"stop acting like an only child\" remark is funny.

I grew up with one full sibling but one parent abandoned us young. As an adult in my 30s I found out about two half siblings. Getting to know them has been really great. I have no contact with the abandoner and won't. But then a few years ago we found another half sibling! I don't know them very well yet but we are in contact and met up once. \n\nI also have gotten to know cousins, aunts, and uncles and even got to have some phone calls with my grandma from that family.  \n\nmy donor/abandoner sucked but the rest of them have been great and I am happy I got in contact. I waited a bit after they reached out.\n\nAnyway you have your own story and feelings to process and just because it worked out for me doesn't mean it will for you. Good luck with a hard decision!", "op=NTA\n\nAs you said she's \"just a teenage girl\"  Your mother has had 16 plus years to try to reconnect to you, she hasn't bothered--she isn't even trying NOW, her daughter is.\n\nIF you are alright with having a low contact relationship with maternal grandparents, just keep refusing.\n\nMy guess, from what you said, that if you start a relationship with any of the half-siblings, that next there may be expectations of financial assistance(from any resources your Paternals have provided you.)\n\nYou could tell Maternal Grandparents that you will MEET her ONCE only if they tell her clearly the TRUE situation of your mother's abandonment.  Though there may be a small chance that she is telling the \"truth\" from her perspective.  She was 16 yrs old and may have found herself in a confusing/controlling situation.  Please remember you have only heard the Paternal side for nearly two decades.", "NTA for not wanting to see your half-siblings, and your grandparents are AHs for calling you \"selfish and spoiled,\" and for prioritizing your half-sister's curiosity over you mental well-being.\n\nI would point out that you call your half-sister \"just a teenage girl,\" but what was your mother when she conceived, carried, birthed, and eventually left you? I realize you think you have the truth of what happened, but that is very unlikely. I guarantee your mother has a completely different perspective on this, and experiences with your father and his family both before your birth and after that you know absolutely nothing about. It's very common for people with money to manipulate and bully those who are more vulnerable, and who is more vulnerable than a pregnant child? Maybe that didn't happen, but aren't you even curious? This is your life, and no one can tell you how to approach this situation, but I wouldn't close the door on the possibility that things aren't 100% as they seem --despite the drunken comments of an old friend (who may or may not have their own agenda) or what your grandparents (who basically dumped you as soon as other grandkids arrived) say.", "NTA, you owe your half-sister nothing.", "NTA. Not meeting her is probably for the best. Things will probably get heated pretty quick since she grew up on lies about you and your dad. I think this is honestly the kindest way to go. \nYou should probably look into some sort of therapy though? You come across as still very much hurt by your childhood (understandably!!) and for your own sake, it would help you to deal with the hurt of it all. Best wishes", "Info. Are you 100% sure things went down the way your paternal family says it did? Were you very small when it all happened? It\u2019s very sad your mom left, but I\u2019d maybe consider that the story you heard may not be the full story.  Your parents were both very young.  Its possible your mom couldn\u2019t handle being a teen mom.  It\u2019s also too easy to paint a woman as a gold digger. \n\nYour sister says your mom did miss you. It\u2019s possible that there is truth in that your dad and his family were toxic. It doesn\u2019t excuse her absence from your life, and I\u2019d never judge if you can\u2019t forgive her. \n\nMy father\u2019s mom left and I don\u2019t think it was an easy decision.  She had a miserable marriage and an unreliable spouse.  She left three kids behind, one of them with severe mental issues. Why did she leave them behind? That, I don\u2019t know.  I suspect because she was very poor.  He moved overseas and only reconnected years after.  she died shortly after beginning to write him letters, before we even got to meet her.  Despite the pain of being abandoned, he regretted not being closer to her before the end.", "> my paternal grandparents who are wealthy\n\nThis i read to much reddit to know she (your mother) want money, you say you are a only child, so you will have all in the inheitance, she is trying to open a window to that future money.\n\nNTA.", "NTA Call me petty. Call me vindictive. I'd meet her for coffee and tell her the truth, the whole truth and nothing but... no I'd also throw in a whole lot of opinion and feelings that your mother caused and which deserve to be laid at her feet. Then I'd tell sis that while none of that was her fault, I had no desire to associate with anyone who thought well of the person I just described... unless she had a reckoning with her mother on the lies.", "Did Mother lie--or did she have a different perspective?  OP has only heard one side for over 16 yrs.  I'm only suggesting it's possible.", "She doesn't \"need\" to do anything. Sharing DNA doesn't entitle anyone to your time. To ignore the message is perfectly reasonable response.", "She says right in the post she didn\u2019t think she could respond without being harsh. In those times the best option is simply not to say anything. She did the Hs a kindness", "Why? She doesn\u2019t want to", "I said she \"should.\" Please learn how to use quotes lol. And that's my opinion.", "Also, NTA."]}
