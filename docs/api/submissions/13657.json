You could easily be forced into the position of having to tell her the unvarnished truth about your mom. That or be forced to sit there and listen to her spewing lies unknowingly.\n\nSome 16s might be mature enough to hear the truth about a parent. But many are not going to be.

Better to seen as not wanting to get to know them than the sorts of labels that might applied because you told the truth.\n\nHalf-sister isn't an A, just clueless.

But at the same time, that you even mentioned it speaks to how much you noticed the shift.\n\nA bigger issue is the way they came at you over the visit. All they should have done was listen to why you didn't respond and either offer to relay a polite decline or give advice on how to do so yourself.\n\nThey know the history, and even if they do not agree, they should respect your disinterest. Which they are clearly not doing. In fact, their position in this was pretty clearly favoring your mother.\n\nFirst, with justifications about why you should do it that were all centered on your half-sister. That it would be good for **her** to know her sister. That you were ruining it for **her**. It doesn't sound like they even tried to suggest some way that it would be good for you.\n\nSecond, with the name calling. Is it selfish to not want to have anything to do with a parent that abbandoned you or their new family? Maybe. But I'd call it putting your personal best interest ahead of people you don't know and have no desire to know.\n\nAnd the \"stop acting like an only child\" remark is funny.

I grew up with one full sibling but one parent abandoned us young. As an adult in my 30s I found out about two half siblings. Getting to know them has been really great. I have no contact with the abandoner and won't. But then a few years ago we found another half sibling! I don't know them very well yet but we are in contact and met up once. \n\nI also have gotten to know cousins, aunts, and uncles and even got to have some phone calls with my grandma from that family.  \n\nmy donor/abandoner sucked but the rest of them have been great and I am happy I got in contact.

I realize you think you have the truth of what happened, but that is very unlikely.
