For context, she and my dad had me when they were both 16 years old. Despite everyone telling her that they would support her no matter what she decided to do about me, she wanted to keep me. I later found out from an old mutual friend of hers and my dad\u2019s that she only kept me because she viewed me as a mealticket to get her every want and whim paid for by my paternal grandparents who are wealthy. After my birth she moved in with my dad so they could both raise me with the help of my grandparents. When it became apparent that my grandparents weren\u2019t going to be treated like her personal bank accounts despite offering to pay for her university education, car and baby stuff for me and that my grandma wasn\u2019t going to be quiet and let her shirk all of her responsibilities onto my dad, she decided to split claiming she couldn\u2019t deal with the pressures of raising a child anymore and she left to go university in France. I haven\u2019t seen her since. My maternal grandparents have been present in my life but their interest in me dwindled when they had other grandkids and now I only see them on special occasions. \n\nEarlier this week I got a message on Facebook from my mother\u2019s 16 year old daughter. This didn\u2019t blindside me as I was aware my mother had gone on to get married and have other kids with her husband that she met at university. The gist of her message was that she also knew I existed and that she planned to come to the UK (where I live) and that she wanted to meet me and in her message was a lot of crap about how my mother missed me and never wanted to leave me but she had to get out of the \u201ctoxic\u201d environment my dad had created. I didn\u2019t respond to her because I didn\u2019t know how to word my refusal without it coming across as harsh. I\u2019ll admit it wasn\u2019t the best move. \n\nShe told my maternal grandparents that I hadn\u2019t responded to her and yesterday they called me asking why and said that I really should meet her as she\u2019s family and it would be good for her to know her sister. I told them I didn\u2019t want to meet her or my other half-sibling and while I understood they weren\u2019t at fault for my mother abandoning me, I wasn\u2019t going to open myself up her or her family, since she\u2019s been lying to her kids about my dad. I pointed out that people with sperm donor fathers aren\u2019t put under pressure to meet half-siblings they might have and that I view my mother as an egg donor. This didn\u2019t go over well and they called me selfish and spoiled, suggested I was too used to the only child life and that I was ruining any chance my half-sister had of knowing her flesh and blood. I told them to figure out how to tell her I wouldn\u2019t be meeting her and hung up.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m an asshole for not wanting to meet her because at the end of the day, she is just a teenage girl and an innocent party in this.

You have no obligation to meet anyone you don't want to, and based on what she said about your mother missing you, it sounds like maybe your half-sister is reaching out at your mother's urging.\n\nThat said, it was a bit of an AH move to not respond at all. You should've waited to write a reply after you calmed down and then had a friend look it over to make sure you weren't being harsh before sending it.

It is likely for their own gain like money. Honestly you don\u2019t have to have a relationship with someone you do not want to meet or see. Don\u2019t let them try to force you into a relationship you do not want. Good luck as they will likely keep trying to push this relationship.", "This is my thought as well.  Sister is just a teenager but\u2014she could have expressed interest and excitement over meeting OP without talking trash about OP\u2019s dad.\n\nAnd I really don\u2019t get the maternal grandparents guilt trip either.

Maybe the truth lies somewhere in the middle.", "But she still dragged her side of the story into the relationship on day 1 and that disqualifies her in my view.

She\u2019s 16, not 6, I wouldn\u2019t meet her because I don\u2019t need that kind of person in my life. You know she already not only has opinions about this, but is also preachy enough to bring it up unwarranted, it\u2019s not crazy to make deductions about some obvious aspects of her character  from this. NTA.", "The problem is that this step sibling is very likely a (perhaps unwitting) flying monkey for the estranged mom. Given what the girl said about how much mom is great and wants to know you I would be very suspicious that there is more to this reaching out than just to connect with a family member.", "It was a friend of my dad\u2019s that I don\u2019t even see anymore. Even my maternal grandparents admit that my mother was in the wrong and behaved terribly towards me and my dad. There was one time when I was a year old when she dropped me off with my maternal grandparents saying it was only going to be for a few hours, then proceeded to go on a bender with her friends for two days without getting in touch with anyone the entire time.

Being related does not mean you have to have a relationship with her. It may not be her fault, but it doesn't change how you feel, or why you feel how you feel.\n\nAnd what if you did meet her? Do you think she's going to be aware enough to not say anything rude about your dad or grandparents? You could easily be forced into the position of having to tell her the unvarnished truth about your mom. That or be forced to sit there and listen to her spewing lies unknowingly.\n\nSome 16s might be mature enough to hear the truth about a parent. But many are not going to be. Especially if it is an unpleasant truth that does not align with their own experience.\n\nIn a few years, maybe. Now? Better to seen as not wanting to get to know them than the sorts of labels that might applied because you told the truth.\n\nHalf-sister isn't an A, just clueless. The real A is mom, obviously.\n\nBut, I hate to say it, your maternal grandparents are in that territory too. If they're not there, they're heading there.\n\nThat they allowed their time with you to diminish because of other grandkids is a small problem. In some ways it's inevitable, yes. But at the same time, that you even mentioned it speaks to how much you noticed the shift.\n\nA bigger issue is the way they came at you over the visit. All they should have done was listen to why you didn't respond and either offer to relay a polite decline or give advice on how to do so yourself.\n\nThey know the history, and even if they do not agree, they should respect your disinterest. Which they are clearly not doing. In fact, their position in this was pretty clearly favoring your mother.\n\nFirst, with justifications about why you should do it that were all centered on your half-sister. That it would be good for **her** to know her sister. That you were ruining it for **her**. It doesn't sound like they even tried to suggest some way that it would be good for you.\n\nSecond, with the name calling. Is it selfish to not want to have anything to do with a parent that abbandoned you or their new family? Maybe. But I'd call it putting your personal best interest ahead of people you don't know and have no desire to know.\n\nAnd the \"stop acting like an only child\" remark is funny. Technically, no you aren't. But that's how you grew up. No reason they should expect you to change just because of some strangers.", "NTA. Mom sure is.", "NTA. \n\nYou owe bio mom or her kids NOTHING. \nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she put her kid up to it to get something from you tbh.", "As someone who also comes from a toxic family the flesh and blood thing doesn't cut it for me.  \n\nLove, kindness and commitment is what makes family.\n\nNTA", "NTA. But there's really no \"correct way\" of handling this because an innocent child is involved. Don't meet her if you don't want to. Unfortunately, she's already been fed a one sided story.

Only advice I can offer is start new social media accounts and keep your mother's family blocked on there.", "As the egg doner misses you she should be reaching out herself.  She has had 22 years to do so.  This almost sounds like a set up as the grandparents that cared for you and your dad have money.

Let her know that this will be the last contact with her.  Then block her.", "NTA.\n\nLady, you did great!\n\nYou refused to let anyone pressure you into doing something against your will.\n\nLife has no shortage of jerkos spouting cliches about family, trying to confuse and guilt you, and you told them no.\n\nYou do not owe this stranger anything, and these other people have nothing to do with it.", "NTA. I think you chose the mature route here. She\u2019s innocent in all of this and either way she\u2019s going to be hurt. Ignoring her or sitting her down and telling her the truth about her mom.
