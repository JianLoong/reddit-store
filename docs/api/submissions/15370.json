When I was a child, I was required to wash my hands before sitting down for dinner. It's the same thing and no big deal. I'd agree if the requirement bound to dinner was unreasonable, but taking a shower regularly is basic and the son can and should manage. Also, OP didn't say that son doesn't get any food but dinner", "Lol \ud83d\ude02 you people crack me up", "I'm not weighing in on either side of the argument y'all are having, just wanted to say... \n\nI doubt the kid will have the willpower to refuse for four days. I also doubt the OP would starve his kid for four days. OP is trying to make a point, but in his frustration, he is choosing the wrong \"tit for tat\" in this situation (as others have said.) In any case, I wouldn't assume OP is going to let his child starve to death just because he's not taking the child out to his favorite restaurant for one night's dinner.", "He can basically eat whenever he wants to. It's not a hard task and quite frankly is very easy. And like I said, I wouldn't do this punishment to my kid, but it's not terrible.", "Kinda missing the forest for the trees there\n\nAnd not showering isn't just being bratty\n\nI didn't because I was a CSA victim", "Food is a human right. It's not a bargaining tool. And yes this is the EXACT definition of withholding.", "It is literally withholding food. My mum did this to me when I was a kid but it wasn\u2019t just about a shower. It could be to stop crying after I\u2019d been punched in the face or I Wouldn\u2019t get my dinner. Or to change my clothes because she had friends coming or I wouldn\u2019t get my dinner. Or get better grades in school or I wouldn\u2019t eat. It\u2019s literally abuse and withholding food. My mum wouldn\u2019t dream of doing this to her grandkids now but she will defend the things she did because \u201cthat\u2019s how it was in the 90s\u201d", "Its much easier to resolve a problem if you know what the problem is. I think you should ask him why he doesn't want to shower. It seems a little odd that you havent already.", "We all crave attention sometimes. Nothing to be ashamed of, but there are more productive ways to seek it.", "Sure, but the parent said any food. That's why I clarified. \nAlso just as a discipline standard, food should not be used as a punishment. Period. There are way more effective ways to discourage behavior. \nBut like I said to OP, maybe they just didn't think of something else at the time in the heat of the moment.", "They're still not saying, \"If you do this, you get to eat. If you don't do this, you have to starve.\"\n\nPlease stop being obtuse.", "That's a strange assumption to make tbh. I mean, is your way of parenting the only way of parenting?", "I abuse my children because I'm ~quirky~ lol \ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\ude18\ud83e\udd74", "I\u2019d rather be hit a million times over than be starved. It was like three hits. No bruises or anything. Op not taking his child to his favorite restaurant is one thing but starving someone is a complete other. Weird you condone starving children but a few hits on the ass is soooo bad.", "I noticed. They seem to have nothing better to do.", "I can\u2019t let you child less bullshitters rule the roost! Ya feel me cuz?", "Damn, every single person responding is literally just projecting their shitty upbringing. Go to therapy mama. Reddit ain\u2019t gonna cut it. YOU\ud83d\udc4fAINT\ud83d\udc4fSAVIN\ud83d\udc4fNO-ONE", "Welcome to my Friday night! Son smells like shit and starving in his room. I\u2019m drinking a Mai Tai! Cheers Bruv", "Disgusting", "Not a parent though? JV team!", "Plenty of people go hungry every day in this modern world.", "Yes especially as a 10 year old kid. You don\u2019t have to worry about shaving and moisturizing afterwards and shit like that. Not yet at least", "*If you deny a child food, period, you are withholding it even temporarily*. To withhold is to deny. That is literally what the word means.", "What are you talking about? Ya'll need to look at the dictionary, please. To withhold is to deny, to refuse, to not grant, to not allow. It does not matter if it is temporary or permanent. Nothing you said relates to the word.", "Lol ok", ">Food is a human right.\n\nMaybe it \"ought to be\" a human right, but it is -- in fact -- not a human right in practice. If you meant, parents are legally obligated to provide sustenance for their children, then yes. If you meant, food is a necessity for survival, then yes. If you meant, the US (and other nations') Constitution(s) gives citizens the right to do what is reasonable within the confines of the law to obtain food, then yes. \n\nBut a human right? No. I don't think we can claim that is a recognized human right with as many starving/malnourished people that exist in the world today. No government is obligated to feed its people. No person is obligated to share their food with a starving person. No starving person has the ability to hunt or forage wherever they please to obtain food. \n\nI do agree that OP went about this totally wrong, though. I just take exception to your claiming that anywhere in the world humanity currently has *the right* to food.", "Do you also think that requiring a child to wash their hands or wear clothes for dinner is \"withholding food\"? If the requirement for dinner is *so simple* it's a basic sanitary requirement or social convention, you can hardly call it withholding food. Son can get by food easily", "I\u2019m sorry that that happened to you but I don\u2019t see the relevance to this situation. This child isn\u2019t having food withheld after being punched in the face? It was an abusive tactic when used in the context of your childhood but it certainly is not abusive in the context of OP\u2019s kid", "Ok I didn't think about that but that is a good point OP should definitely ask him why he doesn't want to take a shower.", "Hey pal, we are both on Reddit right now. Project much? Go pet your dogs and sign into call of duty", "You didn't clarify this though. You asked OP if he refused *dinner* and that's the question they answered. You only mentioned \"only food\" in your reply to that but OP didn't confirm that's correct", "\ud83d\udc4dAre \ud83d\udc4fyou\ud83d\udc4fa\ud83d\udc4fparent? \ud83d\udc4f didn\u2019t think so", "You think that kid is starving? Damn girl, I figured breakfast and lunch was in your lexicon. Guess I be wrong", "I've been in therapy my whole life actually.\n\nThis is called abuse. He did not take away one dinner, he said that they will be no meals at all until the child eats. That is withholding food and abusive. I certainly pray to every God in any religion that you have no children if you think this is okay. Because, you and OP are horrible people.", "I'm guessing there are a ton of non parents posting her. One dinner isn't going to hurt the kid and there is a very easy 4 minute solution to get food. It's right there. If the stand off goes for multiple meals than switch it to bland food.\n\nBut everyone here is just saying electronic and wi fi when there are a ton of kids that don't have or care about that.", "Wait you arent even op, why'd you answer my info request?", "You're not wrong. \nI stand by not using food as a punishment and doing so make him an asshole.", "You're being intentionally obtuse about this comment and you know it. Everyone knows what the original comment meant in regards to \"dinner\".", "Lol, I don't believe you're a parent either so...", "I reported my parents as the reason for my eating disorder as a minor. They didn\u2019t try that shit again.", "Idk if he is or not but threatening food is terrible. Also if you\u2019re making a fat joke I\u2019m not overweight in the slightest.", "Well I saw your comment so I was just saying a lot of boys his age don't care about hygiene and that's probably why but I agree with you that those things could be the reason and op needs to talk to their son", "You JV team girl. Sit down", "\ud83d\ude02 that reporting didn\u2019t so shit. \ud83d\ude02", "Lol I gotta pay more attention when im on here", "Definitely not a parent with those weak ass insults hahaha", "I did though? I never got hit again and I hit back the one time I did plus we all started therapy please get better", "Making fun of someone who had to report their own parents to cps? Classy", "\ud83d\udc85 answer me beeetch", "\ud83d\udc85 DO BETTER", "I don\u2019t believe a GOTTDAMN THING people say on Reddit. You got kids? No? Sit down \ud83e\ude91"]}
