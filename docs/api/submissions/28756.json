She has been dating her ex for a while, and they recently broke up. He (40M) is a very naive person that acts like a child. If I met him at a party I would\u2019ve think he\u2019s one of the guys my age considering how he acts and not mature. My mom has confirmed on this too about his behaviour. She asked me \u201cwhat should I do\u201d in the car while crying. I was shocked by this, because I felt like a bomb dropping on me. I asked her who knew about this and she said only auntie (her sister) and her ex. I said why not grandma (her mother) and she said that grandma would be mad at her and calling her stupid, because she\u2019s raising another kid without a father and grandma doesn\u2019t want to see my mom struggle to get by again. Note: we\u2019re poor, but we have enough to be comfortable because my mom sacrifices a lot for me and her. Growing up I never asked for anything because I understood our living situation at a young age. I would hear stories about how my mom would be awake for more than 24h to take care of me (I was a troublesome baby). We would have to move house every one-two year because of family issues, and I would be in and out of school (every year it would be a new school). Her only support was my auntie and grandma, but auntie has a family now and grandma is quite old. I asked her why she can\u2019t abort it. Her response was because in our belief, if you abort a baby then it would bring bad luck on our family and she doesn\u2019t want that. She believes that bad luck would affect my future a lot. She said if she doesn\u2019t have enough money for the newborn then she would work more, eat less, and spend less when I asked if we have enough money to raise the child. My plan was moving to uni next year (far from home), but after hearing this new, I\u2019m lost. I hate seeing her struggle and be in a constant state of anxiety. Only in the recent years when I\u2019m able to work and help her more around the house, is when I see her less stressed and more relax. I don\u2019t want her to go throw that struggle and I don\u2019t want the child to go through what I experienced.", "created_utc": 1697100068, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17624jc/aita_for_telling_my_mother_to_abort_her_2/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not your mum's parent, nor her partner. You are her child, her adult child but still. Do not give up your life and your dreams for this. Your mum will figure it out. She chose to partner with an immature person. Pregnancy is an expected consequence of a relationship. And your mum should have known that. And she's now choosing to go ahead with the pregnancy. She's an adult and should prepare herself to deal with the consequences of her choices. \n\nShe made a decision to bring you into this world. That was on her. Not you. And she's making a decision again with this baby. This on her again. Not you. \n\nYou can still be there for her but you shouldn't give up your life for her sake.

If she\u2019s worried about how her having an abortion will impact your family\u2019s luck (including your luck) you might be one of the most important people to give her your blessing that she can get an abortion, you\u2019re not afraid of any bad luck, and if any arrives you\u2019ll never think it has anything to do with her making this choice. You\u2019re an important voice, considering how much she loves you and wants you to succeed, and maybe that\u2019s why she\u2019s asking her 19yo son. \n\nOf course, it is her choice. If she wants to have the baby, hopefully for the sake of having a baby and not to prevent bad luck, then she can obviously do so.", "NTA - I sense there will be bad luck either way. Maybe offer to take her to Planned Parenthood to talk out all available options?", "According to your mom's logic someone in her family aborded a baby because you are in a unlucky situation. \n\nI get it , you mom would feel guilty but it's not a baby yet. and miscarriage also happens are this evil mom's or does god punish women who have to go through a miscarriage ? The kid won't be happy to be alive since 90% of kids born into poverty stay poor there is only a small % who manage to get a great education or has some talents which make him wealthy , everyone else struggles. If your mom can't offer the kid a confortable life why putting the baby through the same struggle she is goign through ?", "NTA\n\nYour mother asked for your advice, and as I see it you gave your suggestion with insight and the best intentions.", "Firstly, this isn\u2019t a burden for you. Secondly, your mum has to make a choice. Even the bible says that foetus\u2019 are not babies. \nThis isn\u2019t a choice for you to make and she needs to figure out her own life. She had you young, she knows the consequences. Step back. It\u2019s ok for her to be the parent and You to be the child but above all- NTA.", "NTA. But it sounds like she\u2019s trying to do right by you based on her beliefs. Although it will affect your life and having her may increase the struggle. \n \nIs adoption considered unlucky? \nIt may be the best for this baby.", "NTA.  I know you love your mom, but this is her decision.  At 40 she is old enough to make that decision.  If abortion isn't an option for her, perhaps adoption is.  And if not then she can get through this just as she got through raising you.  She was 21 when you were born.  She is 40 now and I assume more established and likely earning better money.\n\nAlso, as a mother, do not put your life on hold out of some misplaced sense of guilt.  This may be your sibling and she may be your mother, but you do not owe it to your mother to sacrifice your future for this... and based on what you have described my gut says she wouldn't want that anyway.", "Do not f up your own life because of your mother's stupid decisions.

I understand that you care about her, but you must not, should not, can not accept this burden she is offering you.\n\nIf she asks you again what she should do? You say \"I'm your child, not your friend or partner, this is not something I'm comfortable talking about\".\nIf she chooses to have the child, you are not responsible for it or for her. You need to move out and start living your own life.", "I\u2019ve been in that kind of crisis and frankly, adoption is a fabulous option. Because I actually had my entire set of bills, including a 2k car repair supported by the adoption couple. It was an open adoption and I still get to see my son when I like to make plans. I don\u2019t want a child in a position to not be properly taken care of. But being able to choose the couple and have support can be a valid option. Planned parenthood doesn\u2019t do shit for people looking at adoption. They do offer other options but the reality is that keeping or disposing are not the only choices. \n\nYta for not bothering to understand ALL the choices available. Not for wanting her to be realistic about her ability to support another human.\n\nEdit: ESH because mom isn\u2019t acting like a mom asking for difficult life advice from him like a peer.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His concern of financial support for himself and his mom vs a new child prompted poor wording. His mom is not fulfilling her parental role by including him in that mess. But as a young adult he SHOULD NOT wait to be educated until he\u2019s in his own mess. Just because he doesn\u2019t grow the child himself doesn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t know the options so should his gf(if that\u2019s his preference) end up pregnant he can be an educated supporter of her choice. I\u2019m not giving him advice to help his mom. He should know the options of that as much as finances and car maintenance before shit hits the fan so he can actually process the information while not under duress. I changed my judgement to ESH because his no really should never have asked him. Cried? Sure. Asked him for help like that in a crisis? No."]}
