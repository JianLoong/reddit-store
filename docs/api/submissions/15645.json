So the ages were late 20s to early 40s. It was a family friendly event so people brought their kids. They were playing in the yard while most of the adults hung out on the backyard deck. And like always, the parents saw other adults in the area and decided to just walk away and go inside. I don't know why this is a thing a lot of parents tend to do. Parents, why do you just walk away  at outings and expect other people to watch your kids? I don't get it. I could see if it is your immediate family but even then I would warn someone that I was not going to be watching for the safety of my kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was near the end of the night so some people were gone. It was also getting dark and colder so people were inside. The kids were still running around the playing outside I decided to go home. I went inside and said goodbye to the host. Then I got in my car out front and was on my phone for a minute and someone angrily walked up and asked me why I left the backyard. They said I was back there and they were counting on me to watch the kids. Note that this was never said to me. They just went inside and said nothing. I was on the deck and at no point in the night was I ever paying attention to the kids. Nothing dangerous happened to the kids. The parent just saw me walking to my car and freaked out. I told her it's not my job to watch your kids but I probably would have stuck around IF I was asked. I was just sitting on the deck drinking beer and minding my own business. I had already been going back and forth from outside to socialize the whole night like everyone else. Not sure why I was the one singled out. There were times when another person happened to be outside and I was inside. Did they assume we were taking shifts? I don't get the mentality of parents but maybe I'm the asshole here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso want to note that the backyard is NOT fenced off. She brought that up a lot and I just retorted with \"even more reason to stay with your kids.\" The backyard was one of those open ones that opens into the forest.", "created_utc": 1682429065, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yjcog/aita_for_not_watching_kids_at_a_cookout_and/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you walk away then you should expect that your kid must be able to handle themselves on their own, it\u2019s no one else\u2019s responsibility", "NTA, not your kids, not your responsibility, at least not as long as they hadn\u2019t asked, and you hadn\u2019t said yes", "NTA\n\nHonestly, if it isn\u2019t your home, not your liability, then it isn\u2019t your problem.", "NTA\n\n\nWith zero communication how we're you suppost to know they wanted YOU to supervise. Plus by the sounds of it you have no children of your own so it brings up the question as to why they would even consider you staying back there.    \n\n\n\nIn any case there should have been some level of verbal communication.", "NTA. When you announced your intention to leave, that should have been a cue for one of the parents to take responsibility for watching the children.", "NTA especially if you didnt have your own kids there.  What is wrong with people?", "Absolutely NTA. I get that at some events where lots of parents are present people are like, oh, there's strength in numbers and there's likely to always be someone in vicinity of the kids here, so individual parents might not be watching like a hawk at all moments. But, it's absolutely not your job to watch them especially if you were never asked. Totally unfair of them to pin that on you, and to run after you afterwards? Ridiculous.", "Dude, you definitely are NTA. You are not a babysitter. You should not be held in any position to watch their kids.", "NTA! That parent has some nerve! You are not psychic!! They are out of line.", "NTA as a mom of 4 I'd never expect a random person without kids to be watching my kids.", "NTA, this makes no sense why they would assume you\u2019re watching the kids simply due to proximity.", "100% NTA. The only people I\u2019d expect to keep an eye on my kids in a scenario like that is either my wife or my parents. Even then basic communication would be required.", "Absolutely NTA...its up to parents to look after their kids .  Mother is totally an asshole for having the cheek to complain you werent doing her job for her.", "NTA. Not your kids, not your problem. Especially if you were not asked.", "NTA - in what universe is it ok to assume someone else is watching your kids just because they're in the vicinity? Especially when you haven't asked. If it's a \"hey I just need to run to the bathroom do you mind...?\" That's acceptable in my mind but what is with these parents just assuming things?\n\nAlso ...depending on the age of the kids how much supervision did they really need? I know when I was a kid we just took off within certain limits all the time.", "NTA.  It took me a while to figure out none of the kids were even yours, because their reaction makes no sense at all LOL\n\nJust assuming someone else is watching your kids is pretty ridiculous.", "NTA parents these days.....", "NTA.\n\n\"Ma'am if you expect me to babysit your children, not only do you need to ask me first, you also need to compensate me for my time. Have a lovely evening.\"", "NTA it always amazes me when people, expect others to do there job. You are not the parent, its not your place to supervise other people's kids. The sheer audacity of that woman, you were a lot kinder to her than i would have been.", "NTA the nerve of a parent just walking away from their kids and assuming anyone else is taking over without being asked AND THEN GETTING PISSED ABOUT IT.", "NTA however when you saw the kids left unattended the first time something should have been said. That parent had no business getting upset with you though. It\u2019s clear she was banking on you being a lookout in case something happened that\u2019s how she noticed you going to your car. She\u2019s the AH she knew better.", "NTA\n\nI live somewhere where it is totally normal and ok for people to go in and out while lots of adults are around. It\u2019s a community, and we look out for each other. I have no kids and am fine participating in this. However, as it gets dark and people begin leaving , the dynamic changes and the responsibility to ensure the kids are safe absolutely falls on the parent.", "NTA. Nobody asked you to keep an eye on their kids, you didn't bring any kids of your own, and you made it known that you were leaving.", "NTA, I am a parent and you are right about this not being your problem. This is even true of other parents. Don't assume because i am there with my children that i am going to watch your if you walk away.", "As you already know, NTA. I can understand this a little more if one of the kids happens to be yours, which wasn't the case. The only thing you could be faulted for at all is not reminding people that there were still kids outside alone as you were leaving, but even that's a stretch. I have no idea why parents do this.", "You should've told that person to hire a baby sitter if they can't watch their kids", "Definitely NTA. Parents are responsible for their own kids, or making arrangements. Seems like no parent made it a point to ask if you were comfortable with or willing to watch their kids, so it's all on them. You're guilty by proximity? I don't think so.", "NTA. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t have left the kids. I\u2019m also a professional child care provider so its kind of instinctual lol. I would never expect other adults to watch children that aren\u2019t theirs. Parents tend to forget that other peoples lives don\u2019t revolve around children. You have every social right to walk away from kids that aren\u2019t yours, unless there\u2019s an obvious emergency. If they wanted you to watch the kids, they should have asked.", "NTA. As a parent I will never understand this mindset. Just because there are other adults around DOES NOT mean you can expect them to just watch your kids. Either watch your kids yourself or ask someone to keep an eye on them if you need to step away.", "Whaaatt? NTA. I have two children, and if I take them anywhere with me, I never expect anyone else to take care of them unless it's agreed in advance. However, if it's any consolation, I've seen this behavior too. Especially when I'm watching my kids (kids usually play together), the rest of the adults assume they can take it easy because if I look at my two, they're sure I can handle ten more.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That lady was trying to take advantage of you by getting a free babysitter and got upset when her plan failed, as you were leaving the party before her! That meant she had to then watch her own kids.", "NTA. This friend or coworker is full of shit. It's not a thing where you go to a party and expect other beer drinking adults to assume responsibility for your kids. Send her this thread.", "NTA not your kids not your problem. I have to agree with you wondering why \"parents\" dont watch their own kids and instead try to make them everyone elses problem", "Nta they should have hired  a baby sitter if they didn't want to watch their kids", "NTA. If a parent want you to watch their child, they have to ask you first and not assume you are watching them. Their kid is their reponsibility.", "NTA So many accidents happen in these events because every adult will assume someone is watching. I have a child of my own and when in public his dad and I frequently communicate about who is watching him.

Also, it's not fair to dump your kid on someone without at least checking in, even with parent friends, but especially with my single or childless friends, it's not their job unless they want to do it (then I'm all too happy to get a little down time.)\n\nFinally, if the parent had time to walk out and yell at you for their failure as a parent, then obviously their kid was fine, so they're the jerk here, not you.", "NTA\n\nEntitled parents being entitled parents, nothing else to see here.", "NTA.

A) stranger and B) no inquiry about exactly how many beers (or other things) were rightfully enjoyed by said stranger beforehand.", "NTA.\n\nI hate that mindset. If they wanted you to babysit, they should have paid you.", "NTA.  You're right - parents just seem to abandon their kids and assume everybody else is suddenly responsible for THEIR offspring.  I've gotten very up front about this.  I let people know right up front that I'm not the babysitter so if I'm alone with your kids don't assume I'm paying attention.  I'm not part of the village.", "Ugggghhhhh I hate this behaviour from parents. That's how kids drown in pools at family gatherings with adults standing right there.
