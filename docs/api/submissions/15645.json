So the ages were late 20s to early 40s. It was a family friendly event so people brought their kids. They were playing in the yard while most of the adults hung out on the backyard deck. And like always, the parents saw other adults in the area and decided to just walk away and go inside. I don't know why this is a thing a lot of parents tend to do. Parents, why do you just walk away  at outings and expect other people to watch your kids? I don't get it. I could see if it is your immediate family but even then I would warn someone that I was not going to be watching for the safety of my kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was near the end of the night so some people were gone. It was also getting dark and colder so people were inside. The kids were still running around the playing outside I decided to go home. I went inside and said goodbye to the host. Then I got in my car out front and was on my phone for a minute and someone angrily walked up and asked me why I left the backyard. They said I was back there and they were counting on me to watch the kids. Note that this was never said to me. They just went inside and said nothing. I was on the deck and at no point in the night was I ever paying attention to the kids. Nothing dangerous happened to the kids. The parent just saw me walking to my car and freaked out. I told her it's not my job to watch your kids but I probably would have stuck around IF I was asked. I was just sitting on the deck drinking beer and minding my own business. I had already been going back and forth from outside to socialize the whole night like everyone else. Not sure why I was the one singled out. There were times when another person happened to be outside and I was inside. Did they assume we were taking shifts? I don't get the mentality of parents but maybe I'm the asshole here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso want to note that the backyard is NOT fenced off. She brought that up a lot and I just retorted with \"even more reason to stay with your kids.\" The backyard was one of those open ones that opens into the forest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBEfore this gets out of hand. I did not drive drunk. I had a single drink and was not drunk or even somewhat tipsy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedt\n\nI don't think it's clear so I will clarify. I had no knowledge of being on kid duty. The backyard is large and open and lead into the forest. I was on the small deck by the house. At no point in the night was I watching or listening to for kids. The whole night I was periodically going inside and outside freely.

Ridiculous.", "Dude, you definitely are NTA. You are not a babysitter. You should not be held in any position to watch their kids.", "NTA! That parent has some nerve! You are not psychic!! They are out of line.", "NTA as a mom of 4 I'd never expect a random person without kids to be watching my kids.", "NTA, this makes no sense why they would assume you\u2019re watching the kids simply due to proximity.", "100% NTA. The only people I\u2019d expect to keep an eye on my kids in a scenario like that is either my wife or my parents.

If it's a \"hey I just need to run to the bathroom do you mind...?\" That's acceptable in my mind but what is with these parents just assuming things?\n\nAlso ...depending on the age of the kids how much supervision did they really need?

Nobody asked you to keep an eye on their kids, you didn't bring any kids of your own, and you made it known that you were leaving.", "NTA, I am a parent and you are right about this not being your problem. This is even true of other parents. Don't assume because i am there with my children that i am going to watch your if you walk away.", "As you already know, NTA. I can understand this a little more if one of the kids happens to be yours, which wasn't the case. The only thing you could be faulted for at all is not reminding people that there were still kids outside alone as you were leaving, but even that's a stretch. I have no idea why parents do this.", "You should've told that person to hire a baby sitter if they can't watch their kids", "Definitely NTA. Parents are responsible for their own kids, or making arrangements. Seems like no parent made it a point to ask if you were comfortable with or willing to watch their kids, so it's all on them. You're guilty by proximity? I don't think so.", "NTA. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t have left the kids. I\u2019m also a professional child care provider so its kind of instinctual lol. I would never expect other adults to watch children that aren\u2019t theirs. Parents tend to forget that other peoples lives don\u2019t revolve around children. You have every social right to walk away from kids that aren\u2019t yours, unless there\u2019s an obvious emergency. If they wanted you to watch the kids, they should have asked.", "NTA. As a parent I will never understand this mindset. Just because there are other adults around DOES NOT mean you can expect them to just watch your kids. Either watch your kids yourself or ask someone to keep an eye on them if you need to step away.", "Whaaatt? NTA. I have two children, and if I take them anywhere with me, I never expect anyone else to take care of them unless it's agreed in advance. However, if it's any consolation, I've seen this behavior too.

Some people resist that realization, though, because the only comfort they can think of for how they've been treated badly is the promised treat of being able to unfairly push their work off on someone else, so instead of grieving their own hurts like a good person would, they seek to get that treat even if it means inflicting the same hurts on someone else.
