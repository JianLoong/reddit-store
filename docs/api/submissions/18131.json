I feel like this is going into a weird area where my mom feels pressured to have me meet with this girl just because it's her boss's daughter. In fact, I asked my mom why the girl was so eager to meet me, to which my mom said the girl saw a picture of me and thought I was cute. \n3.

Her and her boss are AHs.\n\nIf you don't want to hang but don't want to say no to your mother (which is what I strongly recommend you do) then you could try talking to 20F about it. A friendly \"As you know, your mom has asked my mom if I would hang out with you. These were my plans for the weekend. Is there anything in that you'd be interested in joining in on?\"", "NTA. This is completely inappropriate from your mother and her boss. Tell her that you have plans and are unable to hang around with the girl, and in case she might try a surprise set-up, you are not interested in doing so. At this point your mother may well back off. If not, tell her that she is using you for her career and if it is so innocuous, as the parent she should lead by example. Follow up by immediately asking her for \"alluring\" photographs of her that you can send to your college professors, so that you can arrange meet-ups regardless of her plans, so that you might get better grades. Finish off by being amused at your mother's horrified face and spinning head. xD", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tell mom you will meet her for coffee for a 1 hour time slot but nothing more.  Tell mom that your impression so far is that you don\u2019t like this girl and feel it will be difficult to spend time with her without her being able to tell this is an against your will type of scenario.", "There's a serious lack of info here, and you kinda sound a bit dick-ish, but leaning towards NAH. Dude, it sounds like your mom is trying to set you up on a date. Do you have something else planned? If you seriously don't want to go for whatever reason, tell your mom you're not available. But at the same time I'm assuming she's seen this girl and maybe thinks she's doing you a favor. \n\nPersonally I'd advise carving out an hour from your weekend and take a chance. Have a friend ready to call with an escape plan text/call. Nothing ventured nothing gained.", "NTA politely but firmly assure your mom that you aren't lacking opportunities to meet new people. If she pushes, add specifically that this girl's comment that you were cute feeds into you not wanting to meet her because it sounds like she has expectations that you don't want to fulfill. \n\nIt is NOT REASONABLE to ask you to befriend this girl for the sake of your mother's career", "1000 percent accurate. \n\nHard NTA.", "He doesn't have to do anything he doesn't want to. His mom is pimping her son out so that she can save face in front of her boss while putting him in an uncomfortable situation. He has the right to refuse. He went home to relax, not deal with strange women.", "Nta. Mom is being inappropriate, and boss moreso. Also, and this is bugging me, if boss's daughter is also away at school and not in the office near your mom's desk, for example, *how did she see your picture to decide you were cute??*", "WTF?! Of course you are NTA! That is very inappropriate and weird!\n\nI could get it if you were 3 and 5 and it was a play date but at 18? WTF?!", "NTA. Just tell your mum that you are very sorry she feels the need to do this and involve you because of her job. Tell her that you feel personal life and work life should remain separate and if she thinks it's okay to set you up like this then you would set her up with a random blind date from her company. Some people can't understand where proper lines ought to be drawn in the  sand. Was in a similar situation where someone's mum encouraged their son to get friendly with me. Shut that down fast. Don't let it grow out of proportion. You go find someone you actually are interested in and live your own life.", "NTA. OP just say no.  It makes you uncomfortable.", "Your mother's arguments are all based on what she needs, disguised as what you need. It's not \"an opportunity.\" It's a chore. She's being completely hypocritical and using you as a human sacrifice.\n\nAnd what she is doing is unprofessional, too.\n\nNTA.", "NTA you should lie and say you have a girlfriend already or lie and say you don\u2019t swing that way lol", "I'm not seeing a double standard here. No one on this thread seems to be on the mom's side here. People are pretty outraged for OP", "That\u2019s not friendly at all, passive aggressive and straight up mean. There\u2019s no need to make the girl feel bad", "Yeah that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do. No shot am I meeting this girl because it\u2019s a matter of principle and self respect at this point. Thank you", "They were just showing pictures of eachothers kids and my mom showed some random picture of me from Christmas. It was the boss who then forwarded that to her daughter, so that\u2019s kinda how it went down. But yeah no chance am I hanging out with that girl", "I\u2019m thinking the same thing. Definitely not gonna entertain this and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right of my moms boss", "I don\u2019t know why people are assuming that the mom is doing it for career reasons. She could just be friends with her boss and they realized they had kids the same age and thought they might get along. It\u2019s not at all unusual", "I would both feel bad and want to be aware that my parent was trying to set me up with the children of their direct reports at work - I'd feel awful and be pissed as hell...with my parent, not the poor kid who got roped into this", "It's honest. \n\nIt's only going to make the \"girl\" (she's an 20yo woman, stop infantilising her) feel bad if her mom has lied to her about the motivation behind it and tried to claim OP likes her romantically or if she's deluding herself that he's romantically interested.\n\nOP is literally a stranger to her and vice versa.\n\nFor all we know, the woman may also find it weird AF her mother is trying to set her up on a date. Equally, her mother may have coddled her to the point she can't function at an adult level of emotional maturity and therefore needs her mother to strong arm men into dating her.", "I wouldn't be surprised if that girl was dragged into this mess just as much as you were. It feels like the moms would really like to see you two together and don't care what either of you think about it.\n\n\nHer mum asked for her to be added. Maybe her mum just showed her the picture and she had no idea what her mum wanted from her so she just answered politely. Because that's what I would do if someone sent me a picture of a random guy. \"Yeah, looks nice\"\n\nMaybe she even told her that you were really interested in her.\n\nI would text the girl and ask her what that is about. But in such a way that your disinterest clearly shows (and without accusing her of anything).\n\"Hey, I know this sounds weird but I feel like our mums want to set us up for some reason. I think this is very inappropriate. Can you please talk your mum out of it. I already talked to mine.\"", "My mum tried to set me up with her best friends daughter when we were both 13.\nWe didn't like each other at all. She was really girly and wanted to talk about shopping and boys and I just wanted to read my books in peace. We were forced to be around each other when our mums met up and it was so annoying and awkward.\n\nBut the bullshit you have to deal with is on a whole new level! I can't imagine how pissed I would be! Tell your mum very clearly that she does not get to decide who you meet up with or date!", "Yeah, I completely agree with this and think lots of people ITT are being insane about this. OP is under no obligation to hang out with anyone, but there\u2019s nothing here besides wild speculation to suggest that there\u2019s anything nefarious going on.", "I would much rather know the guy had been made to take me out than actually wanting to before I made an idiot of myself with him."]}
