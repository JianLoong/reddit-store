I feel like this is going into a weird area where my mom feels pressured to have me meet with this girl just because it's her boss's daughter. In fact, I asked my mom why the girl was so eager to meet me, to which my mom said the girl saw a picture of me and thought I was cute. \n3.

My mom's boss asked my mom if I could add the girl on Instagram a while ago, which I did, and she is really just not my type.

My mom makes it sounds like an opportunity to meet and hang out with a new person, but I feel no connection with that girl and I don't think it's right of my mom's boss to go beyond exchanging pictures of each other's kids.

Her and her boss are AHs.\n\nIf you don't want to hang but don't want to say no to your mother (which is what I strongly recommend you do) then you could try talking to 20F about it. A friendly \"As you know, your mom has asked my mom if I would hang out with you. These were my plans for the weekend. Is there anything in that you'd be interested in joining in on?\"", "NTA. This is completely inappropriate from your mother and her boss. Tell her that you have plans and are unable to hang around with the girl, and in case she might try a surprise set-up, you are not interested in doing so. At this point your mother may well back off. If not, tell her that she is using you for her career and if it is so innocuous, as the parent she should lead by example. Follow up by immediately asking her for \"alluring\" photographs of her that you can send to your college professors, so that you can arrange meet-ups regardless of her plans, so that you might get better grades. Finish off by being amused at your mother's horrified face and spinning head. xD", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
