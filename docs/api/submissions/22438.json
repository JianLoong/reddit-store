I work as a teacher and make around 40k, while she works in the private sector and makes \u00a3300-400k after tax. We split our finances equitably, with her paying 70% to my 30%. A little background her parents both immigrated to this country so she and her sisters could succeed in life, and now all have very high-paying jobs, one working in tech and the other being a surgeon. Meanwhile, my parents worked government jobs, and my sister lives on benefits, so we are a relatively low-income family. My wife did help my younger sister when she became a single mother at a young age by offering her a secretary job at her office, but my sister quit after a month as she found it too difficult. (which I can understand as she was raising a baby on her own)Recently, her parents retired, and she and her sister give them around \u00a32000 every month, which I find ridiculous they have pensions; why do they need \u00a36k? She assured me this money does not come out of our joint account. However, when I bought up, my parents were also retired and could use the help. She told me that if I could afford to send it from my own salary, I should. I was shocked and angry; my parents only had me to depend on while her sisters made a lot of money, so her parents would be fine either way.My wife told her her parents sacrificed a lot by moving to this country; it is her responsibility, and my parents should be my responsibility. She says I am being an asshole for asking her to support my parents when she has never put pressure towards me for not contributing more to our household. We had a similar argument before about loaning my sister some money to put a down payment on her house, but my wife said she would not use her money as she thinks my sister is unreliable and won't pay her back. I just don't understand how she can be so cheap because she earns so much more than me. AITA for asking my wife to support my family?\n\nEDIT-  Alot of you are asking why parents need help when they have pension. My Dad has parkinsons his condition is only going to get worse.  My mum isnt strong enough to help with his diaper etc. The only option is to put him in a care home and separate the two of them because we cant afford a live in career. This is frustrating to me as my wife knows all this and her parents are great health currently. Her offering  money would no way break her bank but would help my parents alot. I just think she is being selfish because if the roles were reversed I would help her.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1689552137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151lxiq/aita_for_expecting_my_wife_to_support_my_elderly/", "score": 459, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA, sir. Maybe you should go move in and care for your elderly parents to see what it\u2019s like to work a job and then come home and have to work more.", "YTA, I\u2019m kind of getting the impression your family is a bit entitled.  Your wife helps your sister get a job, she quits it.  You demand your wife lend your sister money, your sister who lives on benefits, who isn\u2019t working, who most likely won\u2019t pay it back?  \n\nYour wife and her sisters do well because they worked hard and their parents sacrificed.  You, your parents and your sister made your own life and career (or lack of) choices.  You are all not entitled to your wife supporting you all.", "YTA - your sense of entitlement is vast. You could end up living on only your salary if you keep up this attitude. \n\nGet a side hustle if you want to support your folks so much", "YTA\n\nShe's your wife,  not a sugar mama for you and your family.", "YTA, not for asking, but for refusing to accept her answer. \nShe's right that she doesn't have an obligation to your parents and you don't have an obligation to hers.", "YTA.   Get a summer job or a side gig.  And why do  your parents not get a pension if they worked government job.   And why is your sister not working NOW.", "YTA\n\nShe isnt being selfish, you are unless you expressed before getting married that you expect her to fund your parents during retirement.\n\nWhy do you believe it is her responsibility to support your parents during their retirement instead of yours?\n\nJust because she and her sister have higher incomes doesnt mean you get to decide how her money is spent.\n\nYou already lived in the country that she and her family immigrated to, so you actually had a.much better start in life that she did.  But she has worked very hard to get where she is and you are wrong to expect her to fund your parents retirement.  She is already paying for the bulk of everything in your relationship  70% vs your 30% contribution.  Im sure your spouse works a lot of hrs in a difficult job for an income of 300000-400000K after taxes.  Probably double the hours you work, if you get summers off.  Maybe you should pick up a parttime.job and send that money to your parents,.or change jobs and get a higher income, rather than expecting your spouse to pay your way in life and fund your parents retirement.\n\nIf i were in her position i would be asking if.i want to remain married to someone when im already paying 70%,  and now thats not enough and someone wants me to also fund their parents retirement.  That would be a hard pass for me.\n\nYour sense of entitlement and negative judgement of your spouse is staggering.", "YTA. Your wife is not a piggy bank and your parents are not her responsibility.", "YTA. If she earns enough to help provide for her parents and still be able to provide for your joint household, you don't get to dictate what she does with her earnings. It's not her fault or responsibility to provide for your family. If you want to help out your parents or sister,  you need to do it from your own income.", "Your wife is right. You have money of your own that you can use to help your parents, just like she does.\n\nYTA", "YTA - If you married someone who earns as much as you do, would you also be expecting them to contribute to your parents\u2019 retirement? You sound like a gold digger.", "I'd never ask my spouse for that kinda help and my parents already planned their retirement to be the least burdensome to me..why aren't your parents doing that? Your wife is assisting her parents because ya they sacrificed a lot for HER and her sisters.. not you...she married beneath her socioeconomic class so it's basically you not seeing she wants you not needs you and you clearly need her $$...imbalanced relationship and expectations", "YTA. You can ask but it\u2019s the entitlement that is making you YTA. She didn\u2019t marry you to be saddled with both supporting her parents, you and your parents. Just because the in-laws get pensions doesn\u2019t mean your parents are entitled to her money that\u2019s left after she pays the majority of your shared living costs. \n\nThis judgment would stand if it was reversed and the wife expecting the breadwinner husband to foot the bill to take care of his in-law aging parents.", "YTA. Your entitlement is absolutely incredible. And yes I would feel the same way if the genders were reversed. It sounds like your sister especially is an irresponsible freeloader.", "YTA. She is largely already supporting you when you are already only contributing 30% of the bills and she does 70%. First you are looking to her to financially take care of your sister, who chose to get pregnant at a young age. Your wife was gracious enough to help her get a job, yet she quit that job. Sounds like she was hoping more for a hand out. Then you wanted her to \u201cloan\u201d money to your sister for a down payment for a house to buy. Your wife is right, your sister will not pay it back and will go on about how it is a gift because your wife can afford it. Sounds like your sister is not ready to buy a home. \n\nSince you are only contributing 30% towards living expenses. That should give you enough to set money aside.\n\nYou are now upset that your wife is sending her parents money each month for their sacrifices. And now you want HER to send money to your parents out of her funds. The money she sends to her parents doesn\u2019t affect you. But you wanting her to send the same to your parents does affect her funds. \n\nI have friends who are teachers, some do quite well, or they also have a second job.", "YTA\n\nThe worst part is this:\n\n>We had a similar argument before about loaning my sister some money to put a down payment on her house, but my wife said she would not use her money as she thinks my sister is unreliable and won't pay her back.\n\nNever loan money to family.

How much are you paying to your family? Looks like nothing.", "Not only are YTA, you\u2019re an entitled brat. You failed at making enough to support your parents in their old age and are looking for a way to rationalize your failure, by blaming your wife. The reason you can\u2019t understand your wife\u2019s POV is because you\u2019re speaking to someone that is GOOD with money. Neither you, your parents, or your sister are, which is why you\u2019re all in this mess. She was right not to give your sister money as well. Believe it or not your wife has your family pegged and it sounds like her parents raised a winner, but frankly this headache she\u2019s going through now is of her own making for marrying into this entitlement. Hope she\u2019s smarter about picking her next husband.", "YTA. She is supporting her parents. You\u2019re not contributing. Your parents are your responsibility. She\u2019s already paying 70% of the household expenses. If your sister could keep a job you\u2019d both be able to support your parents.", "YTA.

If you wanted to pay for your parents\u2019 care in their old age, you should have saved in order to be able to do so. It\u2019s not your wife\u2019s job to pay for your parents\u2019 needs. Your parents should have been saving, too. Your wife isn\u2019t a bank.", "YTA\n\nYou guys have separate finances. Sounds like your wife is more financially savvy on top of earning more. Your expectations are out of line. I would not loan a down payment to your sister either, and she\u2019s probably feeling not great about helping your sister get a job only for her to squander it.", "Sorry, YTA.  Your family, your responsibility.", "YTA \n\nShe's right, you know.", "YTA.  Your wife covers the majority of expenses and does the majority of childcare and household tasks and you are trying to dictate how she uses HER money.  You sound like a freeloader.  Hopefully your wife wakes up and realizes life would be easier without you.", "You say if the roles were reversed you would help but you don't know that. If you had the education and financial upbringing your wife had you might not help take care of her parents. You might even refuse to share the rent equitably and demand each person pay the same amount. A lot of people do. YTA. I get your parents could use the help but just because someone has more money than you do doesn't mean they should give it to you. It would be really generous for her to help. It would be a kind thing to do since you're married. But you don't get to demand her money and to be angry when she's already paying more of the bills and has helped your sister with employment in the past.", "YTA - stop trying to spend money that doesn\u2019t belong to you.

That's terrible.\n\nI'm sorry your dad has Parkinson's. That is a horrible thing.", "WTF is wrong with you?, your wife is not your family's ATM, you're basically asking her to support another household because your sister chose to be a teen mom and you chose a low paying career.\n\nYTA, you want to help your parents, do it from your salary or find a better job.", "How are you currently helping her, her family or even your own family?\nAre you heading to your parents to mow the lawn? Are you doing dishes and making meals, caring for your own children? Baby sitting your nibling to help your sister? \nOr just sitting back making $40k, and guilt tripping your wife into doing not only the lions share of bread winning, but also the lions share of household duties, and asking for even more financial support so you don\u2019t have to physically help out? Are you offering to help her parents- mowing their lawn or whatever, so your wife would feel like you are contributing to her family\u2019s well being as well???? \n\nSounds like you want your wife to care for you, your kids, your house, your sister, your parents, & abandon her family.", "YTA", "Soft YTA While it would be nice if your wife would chip in, it is not her responsibility to do so. Perhaps the best thing for you to do is to look at services/benefits to have help come in to help your mom care for your dad.

She did try to help in the past and your sister burned her, which I noticed you conveniently tried to minimize. I bet that\u2019s not the only time your family has had expectations but didn\u2019t consider her feelings at all.  I noticed in comments she also does most if not all of the household chores and the childcare. So she\u2019s the breadwinner, the primary caregiver, AND she\u2019s supposed to support your family that uses her like a piggy bank? Nah. Shenanigans on that.", "YTA.

Those are good choices that your wife\u2019s parents made and they are now reaping the benefits of all their hard work and dedication.", "Sorry but YTA. Your wife saw her parents sacrifice everything they knew to come here for a better life. In turn, her and her sisters worked hard to get great jobs in high paying industries. There\u2019s no doubt that part of the motivation for them was wanting to be able to support their parents when they got older.\n\nYou had no idea you\u2019d end up with someone who makes a lot of money.

You are the worst kind of hypocrite.  YTA.", "YTA.

And it sucks that you are giving her shit for sticking to your original agreement. It also sounds like your family has a history of attempting to use her as an ATM.", "Yta as it is not the responsibility of one partner to support the parents of another. Some people will, but others won't.\n\nOne thing you do need to look at though. You say you split the household costs equitably. Given the salary difference between you and your wife I think your 70%30% split is off. You should be paying closer to 15%.\n\nRe adjust your household split.

It's not your place to tell your wife what to do with other own money, that she earned through a lot of hard work. Yes, I understand you're worried about your parents, but it's not her job not duty to care for them. She's done enough for your household.

Your wife subsidized your income. She pays majority of the bills. She doesn\u2019t use her money to support her parents she uses hers.\n\nYour sister, and your parents are not her responsibility!

What exactly do you bring to the table?\n\nShe already pays 70% for your joint expenses, yes she is making more income so that is quite expected, but you want more.

She is helping her family out of the rest of her wage, which again is fair.\n\nI would understand if she was the main earner and you did all the housework and parenting, like reversed 1950s stereotypes... but you want her to be the provider and the home maker AND be responsible for your extened family, as well as her own.\n\nShe does enough, dude.\n\nYTA", "NTA for asking. But she is NTA for refusing either. I don't know how old are your parents, I believe if you cannot provide for yourself than you cannot afford being retired. I know many retired people who work because of this. I also feel like you are spoiling your sister. She made a choice to have baby - she should be able to provide it. That's why your wife doesn't want to waste her hard-earned money for a person unable to plan, get profession and decent job. Don't compare her parents with your parents, just help if you can.", "NAH.

I don\u2019t like the roles reversed argument. I think it is such a reach. If the roles were reversed you need to reverse it all. You would be the breadwinner who does all the housework and childcare to the point where your wife hasn\u2019t bonded with your children. You would be helping out your single parent brother in-law and getting hit up right and left by your in laws for money while your wife makes a fraction of what you make and makes no effort to better her situation. Oh and by the way your brother in law doesn\u2019t want to live with his parents because they don\u2019t get along but they\u2019re all mad at YOU for not helping out.

Sure? Is she obligated to? No. Her parents raised a good one and are reaping the benefits of their blood, sweat and tears. I suggest you better yourself. Change careers or get a second job to try to accomplish your goals. Bond with your children. Help raise them and help maintain your house. Have a conversation with your sister about YOUR family situation. Maybe if your wife saw you working hard and your family genuinely doing what they could she would be more amenable to a plea for help.", "NAH. Both sides have points. What I\u2019m wondering is why can\u2019t your mom move in with your sister? That should stabilize her finances.", "Idk what to say honestly, in one side you have no rights over her money, she could buy a new car every month and nothing would be wrong with it because she worked hard to get there and surely she still does. From the other side, I don\u2019t know her relationship with your parents, are they close? If yes, I feel that it wouldn\u2019t hurt her to help them a little bit as well\u2026 I know that if I were earning 30K per month I would go all the way to help people around me who need it . The sister part I agree with tho because she gave her an opportunity and she clearly is not a reliable person, sorry", "I have two answers, first the logical one: You're NTA and she's also NTA. How I see it is you're in a relationship where you split things equally according to earning. You think that means all your costs and family baggage included, and she doesn't. There's a misunderstanding of equality/equity/etc and what relationship costs entail. You need to discuss why family is or is not included and come to some agreement. \n\nI have my emotional answer: I think it's pretty cold to deny someone extra comfort just because you're not blood relatives. I would say I have a similar background to your wife (though not earning that much I bloody wish). If my partner was like hey my parents need extra cash to help throughout this total bullshit economic crisis so they don't eat canned beans for every meal. I would say heck I'm ready here is my cash. I just can't understand money/immigrant struggles stories coming before that. When you marry you take on the whole person. I can't say your wife is a full AH because she has her boundaries and you either accept them or you don't. \n\nAlso emotional answer: your pay is bullshit and does not reflect the actual labour involved in your day to day life, physical and emotional and you should be paid SO MUCH MORE for helping form the next generation. If it were a world based on true equity you'd be better paid, your parents would have been paid more and we wouldn't have this conversation.

I work as a teacher and make around 40k, while she works in the private sector and makes \u00a3300-400k after tax. We split our finances equitably, with her paying 70% to my 30%. A little background her parents both immigrated to this country so she and her sisters could succeed in life, and now all have very high-paying jobs, one working in tech and the other being a surgeon. Meanwhile, my parents worked government jobs, and my sister lives on benefits, so we are a relatively low-income family. My wife did help my younger sister when she became a single mother at a young age by offering her a secretary job at her office, but my sister quit after a month as she found it too difficult. (which I can understand as she was raising a baby on her own)  \nRecently, her parents retired, and she and her sister give them around \u00a32000 every month, which I find ridiculous they have pensions; why do they need \u00a36k? She assured me this money does not come out of our joint account. However, when I bought up, my parents were also retired and could use the help. She told me that if I could afford to send it from my own salary, I should. I was shocked and angry; my parents only had me to depend on while her sisters made a lot of money, so her parents would be fine either way.   \nMy wife told her her parents sacrificed a lot by moving to this country; it is her responsibility, and my parents should be my responsibility. She says I am being an asshole for asking her to support my parents when she has never put pressure towards me for not contributing more to our household. We had a similar argument before about loaning my sister some money to put a down payment on her house, but my wife said she would not use her money as she thinks my sister is unreliable and won't pay her back. I just don't understand how she can be so cheap because she earns so much more than me. AITA for asking my wife to support my family? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

(Which you are not.)", "YTA", "NTA but neither is your wife.\n\nI have to admit this isn't a conversation I've ever had. \n\nWhen my (now ex) husband's mother fell ill (she developed heart and lung problems and had to have multiple surgeries)... There was no part of me that even questioned that I would contribute. Now mind you at the time I was a SAHM but what I did have was time and a very close relationship with my (dearly departed) MIL. \n\nAt the time K (the name we will use for ex-hubby) had a job that was more than willing to let him work from home or remote if he needed to so he could have gone to care for his own mother... However following her surgeries a lot of that care involved certain duties that no son really wants to ever have to perform for their mom if they could avoid it (I'm hoping you catch my drift) so naturally I said I would go. While we made decent money we did not have enough money to be able to provide her with a caregiver and she was on disability and therefore had Medicare and they basically paid for nothing when it came to anything when she left the hospital. So for 6 months... Multiple times I made an 1800 mile journey to help take care of her (by the way this was only possible because of a discount he received an airline tickets in case anyone's wondering why we didn't just take the money and pay for a caregiver).\n\nThere is no part of me that even thought twice about doing this even though it took time away from my children and definitely put stress on my marriage. It was what I could give... But I also knew when I married K... We both had very similar feelings as to how we treated family which was that when push came to shove you did what you needed to do... And everybody took a part of that burden.\n\nNow quite unfortunately my lovely MIL lost her battle... But I'm thankful everyday that I was able to give to her what I could and able to support K as best I could (just an extra bit of information because I know someone on reddit's going to say something about it...when it became apparent she would not recover, I flew home and K flew to be with his Mom in her final days). \n\nHowever depending upon how people were raised... Their reactions to such things can be very different. I won't lie and say that I completely agree with how your wife is reacting to things but I'm certainly not going to judge her because I don't know where she's coming from in this situation.\n\nPerhaps she's thinking about the long-term consequences to your family financials and taking care of your elderly parents and what disadvantages that's going to mean for your own retirements or if one of you get sick or God forbid dies or how it will affect whatever plans you've made for your children.\n\nK and I grew up poor and he was the first (on either side of our families) to ever reach a six figure income. The moment he began making that money neither one of us were under any illusions that we were not going to have to be the family bailout... But perhaps your wife feels differently.\n\nAre there services in which you can apply for for your father? Disability? Medicare? Etc.\n\nI know for you it's a cut and dry subject because for me it would be a cut and dry subject and I will admit I would have a hard time dealing with a partner that didn't look at it the way that I did but perhaps you just need more communication on the subject?\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your father's diagnosis...it's a hard one.

She also made the decision to quit her job.  She chose a hard path.  Her choice.  Your mom and sis don\u2019t get along.  Again, their choice. They don\u2019t want to help each other, that has nothing to do with your wife.", "Maybe your sister should suck it up and help your mom with your dads care since she doesn\u2019t have a job? \n\nWhy is your wife the one that should be responsible for them over their own children???", "So, because it's stressful, your sister doesn't have to do anything, but your wife doesn't get the same easy out? \n\nMaybe if your sister got a job, and you asked your wife to maybe *match* the amount your sister would pay she might.

On both sides!", "So you would commit thousands of dollars monthly to your SO family?", "Oh thanks. I see it's a bit different to what the majority has written. Different people have different life rules I guess?", "Because they have in the past.\n\nBecause once you get married, your family becomes their family too and if anyone in your family needs help, if you can help them you do. Why marry someone if something as simple as helping their parents financially, when you have more than enough money to do it, is too much or too hard? That's dumb.

Your sister attempted to purchase a house with money she didn't have and then attempted to use guilt to get the money for it.  When that failed, she was unable to purchase the house she was unable to afford in the first place.  That is 100% on your sister.", "There it is. Your wife was being generous towards your parents and they repaid her by acting entitled. It sounds like your family isn\u2019t very good at showing gratitude and that\u2019s why your wife\u2019s wallet is closed where they\u2019re concerned.", "And now we know why your wife is refusing to give your parents money. Your wife was paying for them to go on vacations and in return you all repaid her by being mad she wouldn\u2019t give your entitled lazy sister more money.

Her reasoning could also be a cultural thing. You have two different background and upbringings. Sometimes those who penny pinch the most do so because of their upbringing. Sometimes parents instill in their kids certain habits because they are afraid of the worst. \n\nYour wife has seen your families patterns and there\u2019s a reason why she won\u2019t budge on it. \nI used to have your same mindset, but realized I was just continuing to enable certain family members and they knew they could always count on me. It got tiring. At some point people need to take account for themselves and accounts. \n\nYour sister chose not to continue to work because she felt it was hard with the baby. Yeah it\u2019s hard but that\u2019s life, there are always other options and ways of getting support. \n\nYour parents have government jobs which means they do have some sort of pension set in place. If they were not financially smart with their money, that\u2019s on them. \n\nYou have a certain set salary, if you want to go above and beyond for your family, then get another job or find another means of getting more income in, but you can\u2019t expect your partner to cash out, especially in the manner in which you were discussing it. Just like she isn\u2019t going to expect anything from you either, regardless of her making substantially more.", "Why do you assume that if genders were reversed that people would think your spouse should be supporting your parents as well as their own??? That's ludicrous, and your assumptions about how your spouse should spend her money beyond what she contributes to the household does show a really bad gender reversal of, \"What's mine is mine and what's yours is mine, too.\"", "Actually, that's an incorrect assumption about changing the genders on the post... but believe what you want.\n\nI think that YTA... mostly for the b\\*tching about how she needs to spread her wealth around to your family who has, in her experience, acted financially irresponsibly. You asked, she said 'no' and now you're pouting. \n\nAn adult would get another job, start saving, look for government assistance for your parents, set aside a day a week to go to their home and do things for them, start planning now for the inevitable.", "That's funny because not too long ago,  there was a post with the genders switched. People said the and thing they're saying here.", "Except they arent.

I still tell you your parents care is not her responsibility! \n\nShe is paying majority of the bills. Use your income to help them.", "Not from me. I generally think people shouldn\u2019t do this type of separate finance thing in a marriage because it\u2019s nuts to me that spouses would essentially have two different standards of life. Like hitting retirement and one could jet around the world and the other is picking up a part time job to pay their share. BUT if you agree to that system, then you need to abide by it or get mutual consent to change. I don\u2019t care which gender makes more. You agreed to this and now want to have access to her personal funds anyways. What\u2019s interesting is that you didn\u2019t even try to help your parents on your own. It sounds like it was only after you realized your wife was spending money on her family that you started getting avaricious and wanting to do the same, but with her money and her labor rather than your own. You didn\u2019t try to to pull from your personal funds, you didn\u2019t get a second job, you didn\u2019t even think of doing it until you heard she was doing it for her family. \n\nAdd that to your bizarre attempt to have her pay for your sister\u2019s mortgage after she couldn\u2019t even be bothered to hold down an office admin job and yeah, you don\u2019t come off looking good here.", "If the roles were reversed, you would be expected to cook, clean, have an amazing body and open to providing all the sexual compensation every night.

Not sure what that would be in \u00a3.\n\nMarriage law and prenups decide what goes on in a marriage. To my knowledge this couple agreed on a percentage based on income, so she pays more and he pays less. And someone mentioned he commented that she does the housework and childcare.

You don\u2019t help with the house, the kids, or the (majority of the) bills, but you expect your wife to support you AND your entire family? You gave your sister more grace as a single mom when she couldn\u2019t hack it as a secretary at your wife\u2019s work for more than a week.

You\u2019re comparing you buying her sisters flowers in college to her having to fork out for down payments and private nursing care. The audacity.\n\nYou do realize that your wife\u2019s life would actually be less stressful as an official single parent? Are you actively trying to convince her of this?
