{"id": 22438, "submission_id": "151lxiq", "title": "AITA for expecting my wife to support my elderly parents", "selftext": "My wife has a high-paying job and earns significantly more than I do. I work as a teacher and make around 40k, while she works in the private sector and makes \u00a3300-400k after tax. We split our finances equitably, with her paying 70% to my 30%. A little background her parents both immigrated to this country so she and her sisters could succeed in life, and now all have very high-paying jobs, one working in tech and the other being a surgeon. Meanwhile, my parents worked government jobs, and my sister lives on benefits, so we are a relatively low-income family. My wife did help my younger sister when she became a single mother at a young age by offering her a secretary job at her office, but my sister quit after a month as she found it too difficult. (which I can understand as she was raising a baby on her own)Recently, her parents retired, and she and her sister give them around \u00a32000 every month, which I find ridiculous they have pensions; why do they need \u00a36k? She assured me this money does not come out of our joint account. However, when I bought up, my parents were also retired and could use the help. She told me that if I could afford to send it from my own salary, I should. I was shocked and angry; my parents only had me to depend on while her sisters made a lot of money, so her parents would be fine either way.My wife told her her parents sacrificed a lot by moving to this country; it is her responsibility, and my parents should be my responsibility. She says I am being an asshole for asking her to support my parents when she has never put pressure towards me for not contributing more to our household. We had a similar argument before about loaning my sister some money to put a down payment on her house, but my wife said she would not use her money as she thinks my sister is unreliable and won't pay her back. I just don't understand how she can be so cheap because she earns so much more than me. AITA for asking my wife to support my family?\n\nEDIT-  Alot of you are asking why parents need help when they have pension. My Dad has parkinsons his condition is only going to get worse.  My mum isnt strong enough to help with his diaper etc. The only option is to put him in a care home and separate the two of them because we cant afford a live in career. This is frustrating to me as my wife knows all this and her parents are great health currently. Her offering  money would no way break her bank but would help my parents alot. I just think she is being selfish because if the roles were reversed I would help her.\n\nEdit 2 (copying my comment here) \n\nWow I didn't expect this post to blow up. Just to address the elephant in the room, I can see that I am being an asshole and I love and appreciate my wife a lot. I will speak to my sister about moving in my parents like many of you suggested. However there is not much I can do about my job, I am almost 48 and work for the PE department at a shitty secondary school. I can't just quit and make similar amounts to my wife who works in private equity and has multiple rental properties under her name. This post has been kind of a slap in the face and I fully expected everyone to tell me I'm NTA but it turns out I am. I guess it's been an emotional situation with my father his health has been declining and I've felt helpless and when I found my wife can comfortably help her parents I felt a bit betrayed and hurt. I agree that it's not her responsibility to help but I've had sleepless nights imagining my dad at a care home reading horror stories and I guess I just expected my wife to be a bit more empathetic. But I agree that they are my parents are my responsibility I've listened to the replies and will start looking for remote tutor jobs so can pick up the slack and bond more with my daughter. A part of me wants to delete this post so my wife never finds this but I think it will keep as good reminder for the future\n\nI would also like to say my wife has very expensive taste we live in a house that I can by no means afford with my salary, we go on multiply holidays which I also chip in and my wife likes expensive presents which I have to save up for. Even with my salary, I don\u2019t have much in my savings and that\u2019s something I will need to talk to my wife about", "created_utc": 1689552137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151lxiq/aita_for_expecting_my_wife_to_support_my_elderly/", "score": 5273, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife helps your sister get a job, she quits it.  You demand your wife lend your sister money, your sister who lives on benefits, who isn\u2019t working, who most likely won\u2019t pay it back?  \n\nYour wife and her sisters do well because they worked hard and their parents sacrificed.  You, your parents and your sister made your own life and career (or lack of) choices.  You are all not entitled to your wife supporting you all.", "YTA - your sense of entitlement is vast.

And why is your sister not working NOW.", "YTA\n\nShe isnt being selfish, you are unless you expressed before getting married that you expect her to fund your parents during retirement.\n\nWhy do you believe it is her responsibility to support your parents during their retirement instead of yours?\n\nJust because she and her sister have higher incomes doesnt mean you get to decide how her money is spent.\n\nYou already lived in the country that she and her family immigrated to, so you actually had a.much better start in life that she did.  But she has worked very hard to get where she is and you are wrong to expect her to fund your parents retirement.  She is already paying for the bulk of everything in your relationship  70% vs your 30% contribution.  Im sure your spouse works a lot of hrs in a difficult job for an income of 300000-400000K after taxes.  Probably double the hours you work, if you get summers off.  Maybe you should pick up a parttime.job and send that money to your parents,.or change jobs and get a higher income, rather than expecting your spouse to pay your way in life and fund your parents retirement.\n\nIf i were in her position i would be asking if.i want to remain married to someone when im already paying 70%,  and now thats not enough and someone wants me to also fund their parents retirement.  That would be a hard pass for me.\n\nYour sense of entitlement and negative judgement of your spouse is staggering.", "YTA.

You can ask but it\u2019s the entitlement that is making you YTA. She didn\u2019t marry you to be saddled with both supporting her parents, you and your parents.

Your entitlement is absolutely incredible. And yes I would feel the same way if the genders were reversed. It sounds like your sister especially is an irresponsible freeloader.", "YTA. She is largely already supporting you when you are already only contributing 30% of the bills and she does 70%. First you are looking to her to financially take care of your sister, who chose to get pregnant at a young age. Your wife was gracious enough to help her get a job, yet she quit that job. Sounds like she was hoping more for a hand out. Then you wanted her to \u201cloan\u201d money to your sister for a down payment for a house to buy. Your wife is right, your sister will not pay it back and will go on about how it is a gift because your wife can afford it. Sounds like your sister is not ready to buy a home. \n\nSince you are only contributing 30% towards living expenses. That should give you enough to set money aside.\n\nYou are now upset that your wife is sending her parents money each month for their sacrifices. And now you want HER to send money to your parents out of her funds. The money she sends to her parents doesn\u2019t affect you.

Neither you, your parents, or your sister are, which is why you\u2019re all in this mess. She was right not to give your sister money as well. Believe it or not your wife has your family pegged and it sounds like her parents raised a winner, but frankly this headache she\u2019s going through now is of her own making for marrying into this entitlement.

Sure? Is she obligated to? No. Her parents raised a good one and are reaping the benefits of their blood, sweat and tears. I suggest you better yourself. Change careers or get a second job to try to accomplish your goals. Bond with your children. Help raise them and help maintain your house. Have a conversation with your sister about YOUR family situation. Maybe if your wife saw you working hard and your family genuinely doing what they could she would be more amenable to a plea for help.", "NAH. Both sides have points. What I\u2019m wondering is why can\u2019t your mom move in with your sister? That should stabilize her finances.", "Idk what to say honestly, in one side you have no rights over her money, she could buy a new car every month and nothing would be wrong with it because she worked hard to get there and surely she still does. From the other side, I don\u2019t know her relationship with your parents, are they close? If yes, I feel that it wouldn\u2019t hurt her to help them a little bit as well\u2026 I know that if I were earning 30K per month I would go all the way to help people around me who need it . The sister part I agree with tho because she gave her an opportunity and she clearly is not a reliable person, sorry", "I have two answers, first the logical one: You're NTA and she's also NTA. How I see it is you're in a relationship where you split things equally according to earning. You think that means all your costs and family baggage included, and she doesn't. There's a misunderstanding of equality/equity/etc and what relationship costs entail. You need to discuss why family is or is not included and come to some agreement. \n\nI have my emotional answer: I think it's pretty cold to deny someone extra comfort just because you're not blood relatives. I would say I have a similar background to your wife (though not earning that much I bloody wish). If my partner was like hey my parents need extra cash to help throughout this total bullshit economic crisis so they don't eat canned beans for every meal. I would say heck I'm ready here is my cash. I just can't understand money/immigrant struggles stories coming before that. When you marry you take on the whole person. I can't say your wife is a full AH because she has her boundaries and you either accept them or you don't. \n\nAlso emotional answer: your pay is bullshit and does not reflect the actual labour involved in your day to day life, physical and emotional and you should be paid SO MUCH MORE for helping form the next generation. If it were a world based on true equity you'd be better paid, your parents would have been paid more and we wouldn't have this conversation. So it galls me that you're having to factor this in to helping your aging parents. This societal inequity is part or my emotional answer: NTA.", "YTA", "So you just want her to support your entire family? YTA.", "You\u2019re the asshole", "YTA. It\u2019s not your wife\u2019s responsibility to take of your parents because her income is much higher than yours.  Shame on you.", "Well it would be illegal for your wife to loan your sister money to buy a house as a gift and need to be paid back.

Wow, your comment about her parents immigrating to give her and her sister a better chance makes me wonder if you know what that means. Essentially, they left everything they knew and put every spare dollar they had into educating their kids to give them a chance they never had.

That's what everyone who is asking someone for money says, but you haven't gone through what your wife has to get here so you have no idea what you would do if the roles were reversed.\n\nYou're not an AH for asking but YTA for calling your wife selfish for refusing. Your parents are your responsibility, simple as that.", "Yeah, men are always saying if the roles were reversed \ud83d\ude02", "YTA. Dude you keep taking from your your wife. Not giving.

And she clearly can. And her going 'not my parents, not my responsibility' when they matter to you, and you want them to get good care, is cruel to you as her partner.\n\nIf this is supposed to be an equal partnership, then that means you should be working as a TEAM but right now, it sure as heck doesn't feel like you're a team, because you're gonna have to work a second job for likely years and destroy your body and health if you want your parents to get proper care, while she could work a few years, save up a few cool million, and never worry about money again. \n\nAnd at the end of it, you'd hate her.

Your sister, for instance, needs to get a job and support herself. So I can understand why your wife would not want your family income to be frittered away to irresponsible family members who won't hold down a job (saying I have a baby isn't an excuse, and what's her excuse now?) and won't pay it back. \n\nWhere I think she is wrong is that I don't understand couples who have his and hers money unless they married late in life and had significant assets or children. If you married as young people and she just earns more than you, then I think your income should be pooled, just like it should be if you were a SAHP. \n\n**What also strikes me about this post is that in the case of supporting parents, she thinks it IS appropriate to support HER parents to the tune of $2,000 per month. But she's leaving OP's parents in the cold and that's wrong. If they as a couple are going to choose to support their parents or not in their old age, that is a decision they should make as a couple, and apply evenly, or according to need.**", "I'm gonna have the unpopular opinion here, but honestly, NTA.

I can not even fathom making that much money. And if I did, I would be helping out my parents, my partners parents (because I consider them part of my family as well), hell, even my friends! You can live comfortably with much less than that, so why be selfish with it?", "Info: I need some back story, were your parents ever rude to your wife? Has anything happened in the past that currently makes your wife unwilling to help two elderly people?", "I'm going to go with NTA for asking for one reason: mainstream society would roast you alive if the salaries were reversed. The 30% you can contribute is \u00a312k. Sorry, but her 70% means that she is keeping a massive amount of money to herself and out of the joint account. The fact is that 90% of the actual \"feminists\" out there would roast such a man as a financial abuser, misogynist, etc. especially if he told his wife to dip into what little she had left after taxes (\u00a340k or its USD equiv is not much after taxes in either country) to support her parents.\n\nYou've asked, she said no, and this is the arrangement you accepted. So you will be YTA going forward for trying to push her to \"renegotiate\" the finances that much.

I work as a teacher and make around 40k, while she works in the private sector and makes \u00a3300-400k after tax. We split our finances equitably, with her paying 70% to my 30%. A little background her parents both immigrated to this country so she and her sisters could succeed in life, and now all have very high-paying jobs, one working in tech and the other being a surgeon. Meanwhile, my parents worked government jobs, and my sister lives on benefits, so we are a relatively low-income family. My wife did help my younger sister when she became a single mother at a young age by offering her a secretary job at her office, but my sister quit after a month as she found it too difficult. (which I can understand as she was raising a baby on her own)  \nRecently, her parents retired, and she and her sister give them around \u00a32000 every month, which I find ridiculous they have pensions; why do they need \u00a36k? She assured me this money does not come out of our joint account. However, when I bought up, my parents were also retired and could use the help. She told me that if I could afford to send it from my own salary, I should. I was shocked and angry; my parents only had me to depend on while her sisters made a lot of money, so her parents would be fine either way.   \nMy wife told her her parents sacrificed a lot by moving to this country; it is her responsibility, and my parents should be my responsibility. She says I am being an asshole for asking her to support my parents when she has never put pressure towards me for not contributing more to our household. We had a similar argument before about loaning my sister some money to put a down payment on her house, but my wife said she would not use her money as she thinks my sister is unreliable and won't pay her back. I just don't understand how she can be so cheap because she earns so much more than me. AITA for asking my wife to support my family? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There was no part of me that even questioned that I would contribute. Now mind you at the time I was a SAHM but what I did have was time and a very close relationship with my (dearly departed) MIL. \n\nAt the time K (the name we will use for ex-hubby) had a job that was more than willing to let him work from home or remote if he needed to so he could have gone to care for his own mother... However following her surgeries a lot of that care involved certain duties that no son really wants to ever have to perform for their mom if they could avoid it (I'm hoping you catch my drift) so naturally I said I would go. While we made decent money we did not have enough money to be able to provide her with a caregiver and she was on disability and therefore had Medicare and they basically paid for nothing when it came to anything when she left the hospital. So for 6 months... Multiple times I made an 1800 mile journey to help take care of her (by the way this was only possible because of a discount he received an airline tickets in case anyone's wondering why we didn't just take the money and pay for a caregiver).\n\nThere is no part of me that even thought twice about doing this even though it took time away from my children and definitely put stress on my marriage. It was what I could give... But I also knew when I married K... We both had very similar feelings as to how we treated family which was that when push came to shove you did what you needed to do... And everybody took a part of that burden.\n\nNow quite unfortunately my lovely MIL lost her battle... But I'm thankful everyday that I was able to give to her what I could and able to support K as best I could (just an extra bit of information because I know someone on reddit's going to say something about it...when it became apparent she would not recover, I flew home and K flew to be with his Mom in her final days). \n\nHowever depending upon how people were raised... Their reactions to such things can be very different. I won't lie and say that I completely agree with how your wife is reacting to things but I'm certainly not going to judge her because I don't know where she's coming from in this situation.\n\nPerhaps she's thinking about the long-term consequences to your family financials and taking care of your elderly parents and what disadvantages that's going to mean for your own retirements or if one of you get sick or God forbid dies or how it will affect whatever plans you've made for your children.\n\nK and I grew up poor and he was the first (on either side of our families) to ever reach a six figure income. The moment he began making that money neither one of us were under any illusions that we were not going to have to be the family bailout... But perhaps your wife feels differently.\n\nAre there services in which you can apply for for your father? Disability? Medicare? Etc.\n\nI know for you it's a cut and dry subject because for me it would be a cut and dry subject and I will admit I would have a hard time dealing with a partner that didn't look at it the way that I did but perhaps you just need more communication on the subject?\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your father's diagnosis...it's a hard one. All the best. Truly.\n\nEdit: I do want to add that if the situation is making new question whether or not you guys are truly partners then that is a totally valid feeling but I would say approach the situation with your wife with as open mind as possible and try to communicate with each other.

I overall take the view that within reason, you take on each other's families in dire circumstances and this qualifies. But if they haven't built that relationship with her.... Then they haven't. \n\nYou could ask that she cover more of your household costs so that you can cover X cost to keep your parents together with your salary. I suspect that might seem more fair then just giving them a random stipend. They aren't her parents.

This is the kind of thing you should have discussed before marriage, but in my opinion at least, when you're married you're a team. You shouldn't have separate finances at all, let alone have arguments over who pays for what. Your money should go into a joint account, and whatever needs paying for, be that groceries or supporting elderly parents, should come out of it.

Particularly where the standard of living of a couple may align more with the higher salary earner. They want to live in a nicer area, have a nicer family car etc. How is it fair that the lower salary earner (who invests the same amount of time to earn their pay cheque, based on their education, their intelligence) to have to contribute a higher percentage of their salary to meet 50%of the household/life style costs?\n\nHe is a teacher, with his educational background and his career background how likely is it that he is ever going to get even close to 50% of his wife's wage? \n\nWhile money is important the value of a job it is not tied to the salary it attracts.

That is a very different thing, video games do not contribute to the household. \n\nHis post suggests that his wife makes upto 10x his salary, and yet paids just over twice as much in household costs. That is a huge difference. The household costs for her would be minimal, her disposal income would be significant. \n\nFlip the genders in this situation.

People are so greedy.", "I honestly disagree with popular opinion: I think NTA. I even wonder what the response here would have been if genders were reversed.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a friend or a roommate, it\u2019s your spouse. You\u2019re supposed to be partners, and being together shouldn\u2019t put more strain on one of you than the other. If she is planning and selecting expensive things (home, vacations, etc), expecting expensive gifts that you have to save up for, etc while you have virtually no disposable income, then you are put in a position where you\u2019re always struggling to keep up, even at a 70/30 split. And emotionally, if she can afford to just send money to her parents who don\u2019t need it without any strain to her budget, while you\u2019re losing sleep worrying about yours and unable to help, then you\u2019re stuck in a position of greater stress and that will affect your relationship as well. I\u2019ll add here that when you discuss this with her, you should also discuss distribution of other stressors \u2014 make sure housework and childcare are being handled in a way that doesn\u2019t put more strain on her than on you (I realize this doesn\u2019t always mean a 50/50 split; I did most of the housework with my ex husband because he worked longer and less flexible hours than I did, and that was reasonable).\n\nFair and equal aren\u2019t always the same thing, and in a marriage with such a huge income disparity, that gets especially complicated. If she weren\u2019t so well off, I\u2019m guessing you would have chosen a house with a much lower mortgage, probably in a much lower COL area, and even paying 50% would be spending less than you are now; you wouldn\u2019t be planning expensive vacations, or buying expensive gifts. She makes 10 times as much as you do, but she\u2019s only paying 2.33 times as much of the bills while she opts for an expensive lifestyle. If she wants a 30/70 split, she should be compromising to a lifestyle that makes your 30% a manageable amount for your salary; if an expensive lifestyle is a priority to her, then she should pay an amount that still allows you to have some disposable income and some ability to save (not just to buy her gifts, but for your own financial interests, or priorities like helping your parents).\n\nI think the solution here is to say that given your parents\u2019 declining health and your dad\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s, you need to sit down together and rethink the budget. Explain that this is *not* because she has money or because she\u2019s sending so much to her parents; on the contrary, her financial stability is why you weren\u2019t comfortable enough to suggest any cuts sooner \u2014 you want to be able to keep up with her and give her the life she wants. In reality, if you had a partner in your income bracket, you\u2019d have been evaluating solutions when your dad was first diagnosed, but you were worried about her back or failing to make her happy, and that kept you from having this important conversation sooner. Asking her to provide for your parents was an unreasonable response driven by your own financial anxieties. You realize it was unfair to ask her to finance your parents\u2019 care, but you also need to make some adjustments so that you can provide them with the needed support without neglecting your obligations to her and your children, so you\u2019d like to consider making some lifestyle changes so that you can support your parents better. That could mean downsizing to a home with a lower mortgage and taking a break from expensive vacations (she can go without you, it\u2019s okay for partners to do some things independently) so that you can afford in-home support for your parents (or can afford to help them enough to make that possible), or it could mean getting a house with an in-law suite so you can provide your dad with support until his needs exceed your abilities. Go to her with your new budget prepared \u2014 what it would cost for you to afford care for your parents and how much you could contribute to your own household while addressing that need, examples of alternate houses that would meet your family\u2019s needs while still allowing you to pitch in your share while caring for your parents, etc. \n\nMake very clear that your goal is to find a compromise where you can afford to attend to your non-marital priorities without expecting her to fund your life; a luxurious lifestyle is *her* priority, and you\u2019d be grateful if she\u2019d help you find a compromise so that supporting her priorities doesn\u2019t come at cost of yours.\n\nAs a final thought: if you don\u2019t have a prenup, you could also let her know you\u2019d be happy to sign a post-nup so that her best interests are protected. But if you\u2019re working similar hours, then having one of you struggle financially while the other is so comfortable doesn\u2019t make sense to me unless she\u2019s either a) afraid you\u2019re a gold digger (in which case, why are you married? There should be more trust than that in a marriage) or b) worried about a future divorce (in which case you two should be in couple\u2019s counseling to prevent that outcome, not making financial decisions based on the idea that it could happen). If the two of you are going to be together for life and she trusts you not to see her as an ATM, then you should be addressing both her *and* your priorities as a team. Maybe you\u2019re better able to contribute through time and effort while she contributes more financially, but both parties\u2019 needs should be accounted for equally in setting and achieving goals.", "Just reverse the genders and everyone would be saying NTA.

It just makes sense!", "oh but he'd have to parent and his daughter cries for her mom so.......", "Yep, that comment above is unbelievably cursed. People like that are the reason society is failing. \"Bad with money\" for being a mere teacher. Guess your family deserve to suffer. \"Good families\" (thanks eugenics) are good with money, and you should only marry into those.", "She is actually contributing much more. She takes care of the children and does all the housework. He doesn\u2019t even contribute towards that. So, I\u2019m sure he is enjoying the benefits of being married to her with not only her providing him the lifestyle he gets to enjoy but does very little to contribute towards it. Hoping she has a good prenup.", "How about his contribution to society, you know, being a teacher? It's not his fault that soceity doesn't reward or value people doing his (very much essential) job.", "a lot of people have this delusion that the more money you earn, the more socially useful or valuable your work is.", "My thoughts exactly. He sounds entitled to his wife's money and feels his parents and sister are also entitled to her money. He does not even do much housework. YTA.", "this. non contributing, mediocre husband wanting his wife to shoulder the whole world.", "Also sounds like the brother coddles her to think it was justifiable to quit.", "I am glad someone thinks the same. I think partners should contribute equally to the relationship. If someone brings more money into the relationship, the other should share more housework. But it is just my personal belief.", "Thank you! Just read this part. As always, a lot of important information is missing in the post.", "Agreed, but this is why I thought ESH works better than Y T A - she would ideally help the family out as he isn't in a position to, through no fault of his own. Its still not his money though, as frustrating as it may be.", "I thought the UK, then he said \"diaper\" and now I'm not sure. I've never heard that used by anyone other than little girls who watch YouTube doll vids (in UK). Does he comment UK or is it the \u00a3?", "It\u2019s all about balance. The house needs work for us to be healthy and stable enough to earn money. I\u2019m lucky in that my partner is the type to know that housework is of equal value to financial contributions, but gender imbalance is real and sometimes people miss the whole forest for the trees on something as simple as keeping things equitable.", "Am answering calls for Medicare. What you are describing is exactly what we do not do and we have to tell multiple people multiple times a day this is not allowed. But a family member can be employed by an approved agency and be paid that way - very convoluted but the only way it works in this situation for billing purposes.\n\nI'm happy to hear that your state has a program to assist! I'll be sure to have beneficiaries reach out to their state for more help. Is it Medicaid alone or supplemental to Medicare? (if you don't mind answering)", "I'm genuinely curious here, so if you see this it would be great of get an answer.\n\nI'm just setting this out so that I'm clear and we're on the same page. Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n1. The OP's wife takes care of all the household chores, childcare responsibilities, and pays the majority of the bills.\n2. She has also supported her husband's family by taking them on vacations over the years.\n3. The wife helped the SiL and gave her a job at her office, but the sister-in-law quit due to the challenges of balancing work and having a newborn.\n4. The Si\\`L asked for a loan to make a down payment on a house, which the wife refused. Because the wife didn't think it was going to be a load , as the SiL doesn't work. This incident caused a fallout between them, but they have since reconciled.\n5. Both the wife and her sisters contribute \u00a32,000 each to their parents for long-term care.\n6. Now the OP's father has Alzheimers and needs long-term care. the OP and the unemployed sister do not contribute anything towards their parents, but expect the wife to give the same amount  (\u00a32k)to help her PiL?\n\nSo, what we're saying is that she's not being fair or compassionate...? She isn't/hasn't done enough for her husband's family?\n\nEdited grammatical mistakes and to add some more detail.", "Trachable moment would be when she pulls out a tube and a scalpel and performs a tracheotomy on the niece?", "Misuse of apostrophes drives me insane. When did people decide they belong on plural nouns?", "The individual does have to register with the state and I believe undergo a background check, but an agency is not required in my state. I do use an agency just because I have no family close by able to help. I have both Medicare and Medicaid, but not a dual enrollment plan, so it\u2019s through my straight Medicaid which is secondary insurance to Medicare. The services available differ from state to state, but I know of a good number that offer some kind of similar benefits.", "Yeah I mean it\u2019s so incredibly rare to earn \u00a3300-400k in the UK too that this seems a little sus", "Thank you! I will be sure to let people know to check in with state. I detest not being able to actually help within this broken system.", "No. Social care is separate from medical care and it's not free and also is terrible - really stretched, carers are in short supply, desperately underpaid and only get tiny amounts of time with their clients to do the bare minimum. The system is completely broken.", "Yeahno. \n\nThere is a difference between medical and social care. What OP needs is social care, which is virtually non-existent with long waiting lists if you require a council-funded place, both for x4 daily PoC in your own house, or care/nursing home. Most people have to pay private. It\u2019s that or spend months in hospital, which is what many of the patients on my ward are doing. I\u2019ve seen people wait the better part of a year for funded social care.", "It is such a frustrating system to try to survive within and so very broken. The fact that Medicare, designed for senior citizens and the disabled, does not readily cover caregivers when needed is ridiculous. \n\nThe way you care about the people you speak with is refreshing and rather rare, based on my experiences. It means a lot that you truly care. I do hope that at least some callers can benefit from accessing this service through Medicaid.", "prenups reflect the relationship you have before the marriage. If you're both not AHs, you'll agree on something fair and equitable. The problem is you sometimes have people who approach it in a selfish way, and steamroll their spouses. \n\nIt tends to impact spouses who get pregnant, stay at home, or otherwise take a cut in their career for the benefit of the family."]}
