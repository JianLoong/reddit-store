After having many arguments about it I decided it was best for me to move out. We were roommates. A month later she told me she was pregnant i told her I didn\u2019t want to be a father and she basically told me too bad. She kept calling me and asking to buy 2,000 dollar cribs and 1,000 dollar strollers I still wasn\u2019t even sure it was my baby because she was also sleeping with her ex around the same time. I help with what I can but what she is asking for seems to be a bit much. She\u2019s threatening me and even went as far and sending me my ss# saying does this look familiar. \n\nThe baby is now born (she does look like me) and she constantly calls and tells me I have to spend time with the baby.

People here are letting their emotions get in the way of their judgements while also not reading the post lmao.", "I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion for this: NAH.\n\nFirstly, get a paternity test. This is **not** for you, this is for the baby. So many medical problems are indicated by \"family history\" --- *biological* family history. If there is any possibility this kid is not yours, then that means 50% of her family medical history is currently FALSE. If the biodad is someone else, they could have a family history of things that may require testing, monitoring, etc. ***right now***\\--things like SIDS, for example. \n\nThe price tag is steep, but not taking the test could literally contribute to the death of this baby. So if there is **any** possibility that you are not the biological father, which you have stated it is, then it needs to happen for the sake of the child. ASAP.\n\nSecondly, do you believe that being absent from her life is what's best for her? If that is what you truly think, then you're defintely not being an AH - it's a difficult choice to make and you're making it for the benefit of another person. You clearly had not been planning to have a baby, so I recommend talking to a therapist, particularly ones that deal with parent/child situations.\n\nAs much as I want to call the mom an AH, she chose to have a baby and that alone doesn't make her an AH (I don't have enough context to decide one way or another on her decision to keep the baby). And it makes sense that she would want you to be in the kid's life (I am assuming that she sees you as a good person as she expressed interest in a relationship with you). The 2k crib and 1k stroller are ridiculous, but most people I know who are first time parents struggle with this because **everything** is framed as, \"Don't you want what's best for your child?! It's just money!\" and it's so easy to be convinced you need a crib that doubles as a NASA-certified rocket module because \"safety is everything!\"\n\nShe does need to back off and stop pushing you, though. Once you get the paternity test, if the kid is yours, set up child care payments and make sure your decision is reflected in the paper work.", "YTA.

I\u2019ve personally seen the damage an unloving father has on his kids. I think it\u2019s absolutely horrible that we fight for the rights to undergo an abortion and yet we can force a man into an 18 year contract over the same type of mistake. I believe if a woman wants to keep a child that is her right; but she shouldn\u2019t be able to force it on someone else. It just seems hypocritical to a pro-right advocate like myself. Be smarter next time. And take a paternity test!!!", "Yta- it\u2019s your kid dumbass. You are a dad and you have responsibilities to your kid.

That is the bare minimum, and there is nothing wrong with that.\n\nHowever, I urge you (strongly urge you) to \n\n1) run a credit report \n\n2) put a fraud alert on your account with the three credit reporting agencies, if you are in the US.\n\nThe fact that she has threatened you with your social security number is a major concern.  That can screw up your life big time.  You need to make sure she hasn\u2019t opened any credit in your name and purchase a ton of stuff because \u201cyou owe her\u201d.\n\nYou get a free credit report annually from all three agencies (actually, since Covid, it has been free anytime).\n\nProtect yourself.\n\nOn a side note\u2026 meet the baby.

He chose to have unprotected sex and then spent the duration of the pregnancy doing nothing to to prepare, including verifying paternity and ironing out any financial support if  there was proof he was the father. He needs to grow up and deal with this.  \n\nHe can choose to be involved with his child or not, but he needs to think carefully about the consequences of that decision.  Judging by his actions so far, I don\u2019t believe he thinks much beyond the next 5 minutes.", "\u201cHelping out\u201d and paying consistent child support is not the same thing", "Not ignoring it.

When a baby is given up for adoption both parents rights are terminated (unless they absolutely have no idea who the father is). And if a woman choses not to be part of her babies life and dump the baby on the father, she is on the hook for child support, just like he is when the roles are reversed.", "Me too.  I would have rather had no father than a disinterested father who I couldn't count on and constantly disappointed me.", "Monetarily taking responsibility is different, my issue is that she is trying to force him to love something that he may have NEVER wanted. I never want kids, if that were somehow me I\u2019d pay everything I needed to and never see it. He\u2019s asking if he\u2019s TA for not wanting to spend time with the kid. Take the personal bias out, the guy does not suck for wanting to stay away. He knows he can\u2019t give his all, and he\u2019s moving away. None of you have ever dealt with having a disinterested dad. It ruins a child\u2019s self esteem. Would YOU trust a man to watch your baby, one who admittedly did not care about the kid?

I didn\u2019t miss anything. \n\nMy comment in its entirety stands.", "You better get on this quickly.  In some jurisdictions you only have a small amount of time before paternity is assumed by the law, especially since you're the named father.\n\nThat means defaulted and uncontestable support.

After you find out if the child is your you'll need to have a hard think; you already said you'd be happy to pay so no harm there, but you sound wishy washy otherwise so time to think hard.  You can't change your mind later without being an ass.", "Talk to a lawyer. In many places you have to actively contest a paternity claim or the state will assume you are the father by default.", "You didn\u2019t have to sign to have your name put on the birth certificate?", "And in either case, he could have prevented it with a condom.", "This is an underrated comment.", "He stated once that he already helps as of right now but reiterated to her that he wanted nothing to do with the kid but he would support her.

And a baby born inside a common law marriage is automatically assumed to be the common-law husband\u2019s child.  \n\n\nI live in such a state, and when my child was born, the father wasn\u2019t at the hospital when they came in with the birth certificate paperwork. The lady explicitly told me that if I said we were common law married (by this legal standard, we were, but she had no intention of verifying, and probably didn\u2019t need to. The standard is so loose that just having the child together is enough \u201cproof\u201d), I could just write his name with him or without him there. She was almost pushing for me to do it, explaining how it would be more difficult to add him later. So\u2026 very much depends on the state.", "Yup goes both ways", "It\u2019s a basic women-blaming comment. I\u2019m glad there aren\u2019t more.

She might have been able to list you but without a signature acknowledgement. If she or someone else signed your name that's paternity fraud and forgery.\n\nBut that's usually separate from child support claims. Different state agencies and the one collecting child support cares about getting money to kids without it coming from the state budget.", "Both parties are responsible for their behavior.  He is responsible for trusting her word that she was on birth control and not wearing a condom.\n\nShe is responsible for misrepresenting her use of birth control.\n\nWhy is the opinion that both parties are responsible 'woman hating'?", "He probably wants to stay away as she been threatening him with his ss#. You gotta point tho most guys would have been set the paternity test in motion.", "She\u2019s threatening him because she wants him to claim the baby. It\u2019s a read between the lines situation. He\u2019s hoping that he can continue to throw a few bucks at her here and there off the record and then skip town and make it A LOT harder to get paternity and child support established."]}
