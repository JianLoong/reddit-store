After having many arguments about it I decided it was best for me to move out. We were roommates. A month later she told me she was pregnant i told her I didn\u2019t want to be a father and she basically told me too bad. She kept calling me and asking to buy 2,000 dollar cribs and 1,000 dollar strollers I still wasn\u2019t even sure it was my baby because she was also sleeping with her ex around the same time. I help with what I can but what she is asking for seems to be a bit much. She\u2019s threatening me and even went as far and sending me my ss# saying does this look familiar. \n\nThe baby is now born (she does look like me) and she constantly calls and tells me I have to spend time with the baby. I told her I would support the baby but I did not think it was a great idea for me to be in her life.

People here are letting their emotions get in the way of their judgements while also not reading the post lmao.", "I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion for this: NAH.\n\nFirstly, get a paternity test. This is **not** for you, this is for the baby. So many medical problems are indicated by \"family history\" --- *biological* family history. If there is any possibility this kid is not yours, then that means 50% of her family medical history is currently FALSE. If the biodad is someone else, they could have a family history of things that may require testing, monitoring, etc. ***right now***\\--things like SIDS, for example. \n\nThe price tag is steep, but not taking the test could literally contribute to the death of this baby. So if there is **any** possibility that you are not the biological father, which you have stated it is, then it needs to happen for the sake of the child. ASAP.\n\nSecondly, do you believe that being absent from her life is what's best for her? If that is what you truly think, then you're defintely not being an AH - it's a difficult choice to make and you're making it for the benefit of another person. You clearly had not been planning to have a baby, so I recommend talking to a therapist, particularly ones that deal with parent/child situations.\n\nAs much as I want to call the mom an AH, she chose to have a baby and that alone doesn't make her an AH (I don't have enough context to decide one way or another on her decision to keep the baby). And it makes sense that she would want you to be in the kid's life (I am assuming that she sees you as a good person as she expressed interest in a relationship with you). The 2k crib and 1k stroller are ridiculous, but most people I know who are first time parents struggle with this because **everything** is framed as, \"Don't you want what's best for your child?! It's just money!\" and it's so easy to be convinced you need a crib that doubles as a NASA-certified rocket module because \"safety is everything!\"\n\nShe does need to back off and stop pushing you, though. Once you get the paternity test, if the kid is yours, set up child care payments and make sure your decision is reflected in the paper work.", "YTA.

I\u2019ve personally seen the damage an unloving father has on his kids. I think it\u2019s absolutely horrible that we fight for the rights to undergo an abortion and yet we can force a man into an 18 year contract over the same type of mistake. I believe if a woman wants to keep a child that is her right; but she shouldn\u2019t be able to force it on someone else. It just seems hypocritical to a pro-right advocate like myself. Be smarter next time. And take a paternity test!!!", "Yta- it\u2019s your kid dumbass. You are a dad and you have responsibilities to your kid.

That is the bare minimum, and there is nothing wrong with that.\n\nHowever, I urge you (strongly urge you) to \n\n1) run a credit report \n\n2) put a fraud alert on your account with the three credit reporting agencies, if you are in the US.\n\nThe fact that she has threatened you with your social security number is a major concern.  That can screw up your life big time.  You need to make sure she hasn\u2019t opened any credit in your name and purchase a ton of stuff because \u201cyou owe her\u201d.\n\nYou get a free credit report annually from all three agencies (actually, since Covid, it has been free anytime).\n\nProtect yourself.\n\nOn a side note\u2026 meet the baby.

You do owe child support for 18 yrs.  NTA", "NTA. Get a test and also WRAP YOUR DICK", "From what I've heard you have already fucked up. I've heard of instances where \"Giving money/supporting her claims fathership\" meant that you got pulled into having to pay for the next 18 years.\n\nBut as all the other comments say. Lawyer. Paternity test.", "Lawyer, paternity test, and then (depending on the outcome of said test) step up financially as you should do. You had sex, you presumably knew that meant there was alway a risk of making a kid, and you made the kid. I appreciate that you don't want to be a flaky in-and-out dad, and it's best not to put a child through that emotional turmoil. That's why I've said lawyer. They can help you work out the legalities of signing away any parental responsibility (if that's what you really want) and set up reasonable and responsible financial support for said child. I do recommend you go and see her at least once though. The decision to walk away isn't one you make lightly and you need to be absolutely SURE before you cut those strings.", "NTA", "NTA im going a bit off grain with this judgement i think.\nSure abondoning a kid is never nice, BUT you two didnt plan to conceive a child and as much as it is a womens choice not to get a child, you have the same rights. IF you have been upfront with her and told her you didnt want a kid when an abortion was still a possibility you cant be hold accountable for not wanting to have a child.\n\nAlso i think its better for the child to get raised by a loving single mother, than having a father thats only sometimes in his life, because as you said, you wont be able to put this child first.", "YTA, and a deadbeat.\n\nEasy to not get people pregnant.", "YTA. Get a paternity test.  You knew sex can lead to babies. It not just about letting your FWB parent alone, you owe your child a father. Growing up without a loving father will more likely be devastating. Be a man if you\u2019re the dad and parent the child you fathered.", "NTA. If the baby is yours, she deserves better than a fly-in, fly-out father. But in all seriousness. Do not offer her anything - not even child support - without a paternity test confirming you're that baby's father. Tell her point blank that you won't sign anything or do anything more without that paternity test. And make it clear that, if it does come back that you're the father, you will only fulfill financial obligations. That's it.", "NTA. Unfortunately you got baby trapped.", "YTA", "YTA. Wear a condom if you don\u2019t want children.", "YTA But its ok. If the kid is yours and you choose to disappear out of the kids life of course you're an ah. However, that being said it's your decision and it's ok\n\n\nSometimes in life we have to make decisions that our best for our own well being and life. It doesn't resolve you from being an A H But it's still a decision you should be allowed to make \n\nLike others said paternity test and lawyer. Might seem expensive today but if it's not your kid it's gonna save you tons and tons of money.", "BIRTH CONTROL ever heard of it? The PAIR of you are AHs!", "A committed relationship doesn\u2019t mean that the child will be wanted and you shouldn\u2019t promote such bs", "Missing the point. But thank you", "Saying it isn\u2019t yours isn\u2019t enough to keep you from paying child support.  If the ex takes him to court for it, his lawyer will want the paternity test.", "Or ever seeks any sort of gov't aid for the kid.", "If you're married usually by law the kid is assumed to be the child of the couple, unless one of the parents state otherwise.", "When your married the husband doesn't need to sign. He is the legal father even if not biologically, which can be its own problem later on. When not married there is an acknowledgment of paternity form that the father can sign. If OPs former fwb had someone sign it with his name then it's fraudulent. Or it is not signed at all and she's trying to scare him into being a dad", "Same In Massachusetts, husband is legally the father despite actual paternity. It almost cause a headache for a friend of mine who had an accidental pregnancy while her ex was dragging his feet during their divorce.", "Damn, that fucks up my plan."]}
