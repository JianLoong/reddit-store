It\u2019s a pretty big deal for me, as it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been working towards for several years now. My school is considered one of the top law schools in the country, and as far as accomplishments in life go, this is definitely my biggest one. \n\nI have asked my family to come watch my graduation. They are all flying into town for the event, and I have planned a nice dinner for all of us to celebrate after the graduation ceremony. The guest list includes myself, my parents, my dads second wife, as well as my older brother and his wife. \n\nTo put it lightly, my family does not get along. My parents had a messy divorce a few years ago and things have not improved since then. The worst tension is between my brother and my dad. They barely speak to each other and are always at odds. Their respective spouses have also gotten involved in their feud, making matters much worse. \n\nMy brother called me and told me that I am being selfish for expecting everyone to come together for this event. He says I that I\u2019m being narcissistic and just want people to praise me. He called me a \u201cchaos agent\u201d who is forcing everyone to interact so that I can watch them argue. \n\nI don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve done anything wrong. I have a good relationship with all of them, and don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask for everyone to get along for one weekend to celebrate my graduation. It really does mean a lot to me\u2014I don\u2019t have a partner or many friends to celebrate with. \n\nI feel like they\u2019re the ones being unreasonable. All my colleagues have family coming in to celebrate, and setting aside my family\u2019s issues for one weekend shouldn\u2019t be that difficult.

I know of a few people who had separate graduation events for a blended family. For example; Dad's dinner the night before and Mum's dinner the night of. \n\nAlso, I think your brother is being a smidge dramatic with the 'chaos agent' comment lol. It really shouldn't be asking too much for all parties to behave but sometimes the history just doesn't allow for that.", "ESH. \nI think we are missing a lot of backstory about why your brother and dad can\u2019t be in the same room together.\n\nYour brother is clearly an AH for lashing out and blaming you for the bad relationship he has with your dad. \n\nBut you\u2019re asking your messy family (and lots of us have messy families) to act out a little play for you at dinner, where everyone gets along and is cheerful. \n\nIt might be that your family can\u2019t be in a room together without arguing. Maybe that\u2019s something you can fix someday (don\u2019t bet on it) but you certainly can\u2019t fix it before your graduation.", "NTA although expecting them to get along seems to be far fetched dream. Why not have two separate parties or dinner with both sides but on different days. At least there will be happy memories of it than unwanted drama. Do they not teach this in the law school?", "It would be great if they get along. But it is indeed a heavy demand to ask people that hate each other to act like they get along just for your convenience.\n\nIt is not the same to put a smile on your face in a supermarket while tending to an AH client that will be gone in a minute, than do the same with the people that you think ruined your life, for a whole weekend. There is people that can do that, there is people that can't. I, for example, could not, ever, in my life. We all, the mutual enemies, should be biting our tongues to avoid confrontation, for days, while the partying person (you, in this case) enjoys themself. Shit would hit the fan for sure.\n\nSo, yes, soft YTA for demanding something that can be possible only in exchange of a mental toll for the others.\n\nI would say N A H if you were more accepting of their problems.", "NAH\n\nYou're not an AH for wanting everyone to come together for your graduation. However, this doesn't really acknowledge the difficulty people have in putting aside their strong emotions. Saying you don't think it's too much to ask or that it shouldn't be difficult is really minimising of their experience of their feelings. Your request is a somewhat naive one. \n\nThey're not AHs for not wanting to all be a room together. When you have such a visceral reaction to another person why would you want to spend time in a room with them? I could possibly understand it if it were a large party and everyone except two people got on so there was limited chance of them being near each other but this sounds like a lot of people loathe each other so expecting them to put all their feelings aside to have a meal with you is unrealistic.", "NAH\n\nWell, I think it's a very sweet wish, but I think you want the impossible.\n\nAt best, they will only be acting polite, which would make it a very strained and uncomfortable evening, sort-of defeating the purpose of having a celebration dinner at all. Best case scenario.\n\nThe practical solution would be to resign yourself to the fact they're irreconcilable, and have 2 separate dinners to celebrate, or something like that.", "YTA messy divorce usually means some kind of affairs or major domestic or financial issues. You haven't stated the reason why your brother and father don't get along.\nYou expect after that , people will pretend everything's fine especially if there will be current and ex spouses?\nYou stated your graduation is a big deal for you and what you're doing is kinda selfish tbh. You can celebrate separately with your father and mother's family or just include your own family without involving the spouses if you don't want drama on your special day. Sounds like you do.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d still not force them to spend time together, though.\n\nAs much as I understand your wish for them to get along, the truth is they don\u2019t. In the unlikely case that nobody starts a fight, this celebration will be tense at best and a total blowout if things go  really bad. \n\nIn a perfect world they\u2019d all get along and honour your accomplishments the way you deserve, but the world isn\u2019t perfect so you better work with what you\u2019re given instead of enforcing something that isn\u2019t there.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for trying, though.", "YTA.\n\nAsking a bunch of people with disagreements to 'just get along' is an awfully odd stance for a lawyer to take.\n\nHowever, the reason it's a problem is that it tells somebody that their grievance isn't legitimate, and that they need to accept bad behavior to make you happy.\n\n\"Can you guys avoid conflict for the weekend to attend my graduation\" is fine.\n\n> and setting aside my family\u2019s issues for one weekend shouldn\u2019t be that difficult. \n\nThis is a terrible position for somebody to have towards their family members, and again, a really weird position for a lawyer to take.", "NTA. It's quite understandable that you want your family to get along and celebrate your biggest achievement so far.\n\nBut I think it's also important to acknowledge, that this is not the way emotions and family feuds work. My mother's family also has a big feud and it's incredible how petty they're to each other. They display behavior that wouldn't be accepted for kindergarten kids. I don't know how deep your family feud goes, but I think if you really want to celebrate, it would be better to have two celebrations and don't get the conflicting parties together and expect them to play nice. If they are anything like my mom's family, you will have a chilled atmosphere at best.", "NTA and this is your line: \n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of myself and my achievement and would like to celebrate it with my family.  You are all meant to love me so I cannot understand why you would want to ruin my evening by continuing your petty shit\u201d", "NTA It's a double agent scenario.", "Nta", "NTA This is one of the most significant moments of your life and it's reasonable to expect your close family members to put aside their shit for a day to celebrate with you. Be prepared for that plan to fail, though. Perhaps plan some activities that will keep people occupied. If they spend hours together with nothing to do except talk to each other that seems like a disaster waiting to happen.", "Lmao... he is being completely unreasonable.  You are NTA for wanting your family to share in and celebrate your accomplishment. Your brother doesn't want to be around your father and is blaming you for wanting to share.", "NTA - If they feel their quarrels are more important than your big day, then one of the parties should just RVSP that they cannot make it and be done with it. I see no reason why they should hold it over your head and blame you for purposely inciting chaos.", "My family is kinda similar.\nYou are NTA.\n\nBut what you want is simply impossible, ppl who hate eachother ain\u2019t gonna be friendly with eachother no matter the reason.\n\nYou can\u2019t expect ppl to ignore the pain the other person caused them, for ( big for you but insignificant for them) your accomplishment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is not unreasonable to expect people to put their differences aside for one weekend to come together as a family. \n\nHonestly all these people who hold on to bad blood after divorces are exhausting. They only perpetuate the hurt when they don't let things go and move on. Your parents' marriage didn't work out, and they did the best thing by letting each other live their lives separately. Children never know the full extent of what happened to lead to the marriage breakdown so they should be as neutral as possible. As long as the parents maintain their relationships with the children, what goes on between their parents is really none of their business unless there's some form of continuing abuse.\n\nYour brother is being narcissistic by assuming that he and your father will be the center of attention. They are both entirely capable of choosing to behave themselves and refrain from arguing. If they are that petty and immature they should just agree not to speak to each other the entire weekend. Their love for you and desire to be supportive should be more important than their ill will toward each other. If they won't behave, exclude them.\n\nAnd congratulations on graduating!", "NTA, they dont have to like each other you're just asking people to be civil for a day.", "Soft YTA. You're grown enough now to accept that they don't get along and surely you'll have a better time without the tension. Why not have 2 celebrations. 1st with mum, brother and Co and a 2nd with dad and second wife.... milk the celebration because you've worked hard and earned it.", "Haha yes my brother definitely deals in extremes. \ud83d\ude05", "I\u2019m worried that arranging separate celebrations will only make conflict inevitable. \n\nThe heart of the issue with my family is that my dad wants us all to be a big blended family, but my brother blames him and his new wife for \u201cdestroying our lives.\u201d When we are separate, my dad gets angry that we \u201cdon\u2019t accept his choices.\u201d When we are together, my brother is angry that \u201cdad is getting away with what he did without paying the costs.\u201d \n\nI really just want this weekend to be about me, which is why I think I might be the asshole. My brother clearly thinks I\u2019m choosing a side in the conflict, when really for me it\u2019s a separate issue. \n\nTrue rock and a hard place with those two.", "> Well, I think it's a very sweet wish, but I think you want the impossible.\n\n\"Just ignore your issues and grievances and get along\" is not a sweet wish.\n\n\"Can we resolve the issues as best as possible and have everybody feel heard, validated, and reasonably whole\" would be a sweet wish.", "I do understand that it\u2019s difficult for them. I guess I just wish they could at least be polite for my sake. \n\nTheir conflict has really caused me a lot of grief. my parents announced their divorce on the same day I graduated from undergrad. My mom got blackout drunk and had a breakdown in the middle of a restaurant, and I had to literally carry her to the car and take her home while all my friends were celebrating. At my brothers wedding, I had to console my dads new wife who was crying in the bathroom because my brother refused to speak to her. It got so bad that my girlfriend of four years broke up with me because she couldn\u2019t handle all the family drama anymore. I\u2019ve been pretty lonely ever since, living far away from all my friends and family for the last two years. I know it\u2019s selfish, but I just feel like they owe me at least one good weekend where I can be happy for myself after playing peacemaker for all these years. I\u2019m just tired of everyone being separated and angry at each other. \n\nI guess the irony of it all is that I\u2019m already stressed about it. Everyone is already mad at eachother and they haven\u2019t even gotten here yet. By trying to force this I\u2019ve basically guaranteed the worst possible outcome :/", "What does that mean?", "Well my brother initially wasn\u2019t going to come for that reason, but I kindof forced him. I think that might push me over into asshole territory.", "Why does your brother blame your dad and stepmom?", "It sucks that things are this way, but you\u2019re setting yourself and all of them up for more drama and trauma. It doesn\u2019t make you an asshole exactly. Just unrealistic to the point of delusion if you think things will go well just because you are owed it.", "Even if they owe you, their behavior won't be rooted in rationale, but in emotions. Strong emotions always win. \n\nIt sucks, but you have to adjust your expectations, or you will get disappointed. Of course that depends on how deep the feud goes, but what I get from your OP and comments, it runs deep and neither of the involved parties is willing to overcome the feud.", ">  I guess I just wish they could at least be polite for my sake.\n\nAnd I'm sure they wish you'd actually understand their feelings and issues, and not expect them to be in the room with people they despise just so you can have an entourage at your graduation.\n\nBut here we are."]}
