This wedding seems so complicated with groups and everything. Your actually way more reasonable than your headline implies as you seem to be fine with your mom being there as long as you don't have to be directly in the same group and have to see her. Your sister should respect that wish.", "NTA. Your sister is purposely trying to manipulate you into forgiving your mom. Please don\u2019t let her play dumb. You do what you need to for you. Your sister could easily put you in another group.", ">\u201cput me and my moms issue aside\u201d + \"if I loved her I\u2019d stop being bitter and get over myself\"\n\nNo.  You don't ignore what your abuser/enabler did for the sake of your sister's peaceful wedding.  That's not a reasonable or sisterly ask.  NTA  Sister is selfish as hell.", "NTA.\n\nIf you can\u2019t deal with it then you can\u2019t. And you offered to still be a guest. You asked to be put in a different group and you weren\u2019t. The last resort is to drop out.", "I am sorry you had to go through that, you get to decide what your relationship with your biological mother is and you get to set healthy boundaries.  That your sister is weaponizing family members and others against you is wildly inappropriate.  NTA", "NTA. She is. She knows about your relationship with your mom and she deliberately put you in the same group. No way that it was accidental. I wouldn\u2019t even bother going as a guest. Take that day and pamper yourself at a spa.", "NTA \n\nSometimes it\u2019s not possible to play happy families, your sister is being unrealistic and really naive.", "NTA. You told your sister you couldn\u2019t deal with your mother for months and you even tried, you have done more than enough. Your sister has ignored what you said and is trivialising what you went through. It\u2019s disappointing that the rest of your family are brushing child abuse under the carpet like this sorry OP.", "NTA - She told you that you wouldn't have to deal with you mom and then put you in a group with her anyway. How about flipping your sister's statement back on her. \"If you loved me you would accept my boundaries and remove me from the group with our mom.\" I mean you aren't even saying I won't go if she is there. You are saying I don't want to be involved in the wedding if in order to do so I have to deal with mom. To me it sounds as if your sister is selfish. She is trying to use her wedding to \"fix the fam\".", "NTA you were clear about your concerns from the start and your sister reassured you\u2026 to only go back on that at the first chance she gets? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that was pretty intentional but I don\u2019t know your family.", "Nta - it's her \"day\", not her \"months of planning\".

If she really wanted you to be a part of it, SHE would switch the groups (which is so dumb anyways).", "NTA\n\nNo is a complete sentence and your sister does NOT get to dictate how you process your trauma. \n\nYou were extremely upfront and honest with your sister from the start about your concerns and she agreed to your *very* reasonable boundaries. \n\nAnd then she tried to force you over each and every one of those boundaries. You tried your best to manage but when you tried to find an accommodation with your sister, she failed you again. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t get to bully you into putting yourself in an extremely toxic situation by crying \u2018it\u2019s my day\u2019. She made her choice, and now she needs to respect your choice.", "Definitely NTA.

Im sorry you are dealing with this but honestly the only end I see is going NC with the whole fam", "NTA\n\nYou tried to make being around your mom work. When it wouldn't, you tried to just get put in a new group, and your sister refused. She lied to you when she said you wouldn't have to be around your mom.\n\nYour own mental stability is more important than being a brides maid. It makes your actions not really selfish. What is selfish is your sister trying to coerce you into doing something she wants you to do but you're not comfortable with by calling you selfish. She's trying to make you feel guilty. Whether intentional or not, it is emotional manilulation.\n\nAlso, if being around your mom for an hour led to a breakdown, it might be a good idea to see a therapist for a bit. I'm no expert, but just a thought.", "NTA and your sister is being awful about this. She's not your boss, she can't assign you to a planning group and expect you to just suck it up. You're doing her a favour by helping with the planning.\n\nYou also didn't ask her to choose between you and her mother - she's framing it that way because it makes her look like less of a selfish and entitled b'zilla.", "Your sister assured you that you wouldn\u2019t cross paths with your mother. The first event she placed you with your mother. \n\nThis situation isn\u2019t going to get any better and the only way for you to protect your own mental health is to withdraw. \n\nETA - the reaction from the family just supports that. They have no idea what your relationship was like with your mother and trying to guilt trip you into it is really really poor. \n\nNTA.", "NTA you decide your own limits. I didn't went to my dad's funeral because I couldn't deal with the drama. Nobody else can judge how you feel. Do right by yourself.", "NTA it sounds like your sister specifically set up the groups so you and your mom would be together and have to interact. This is either her plan or your moms plan to get you guys to forgive each other. And if you are determined at this point in time to not have alot of contact with your mom (which is totally understandable) that is your decision. You cannot be bullied into accepting feeling which you do not reciprocate. You might want to tell this to your sister directly and tell her that any more meddling between the relationship between you and your mother will probably end up just having a negative effect as it is something you do not/cannot wish to handle at the moment. Its not like you directly told her when you became a  bridesmaid that you did not want to deal with your mother and then she went and did the exact opposite, if she does not know what she is doing then its on her wedding planner or she is just oblivious any option is not a good one though.", "NTA. You should go to the wedding, but your sister is an AH for forcing you into a group with your mother. So, you were right to drop out of that.", "I was prepared to say Y T A if it was just wedding-day stuff, but that was incredibly shitty of her to put you in a group with your mom.\n\nAlso, I'm glad I got married before it became so much work for people in the bridal party. \n\nNTA", "INFO: any reason you can not be part of the wedding but not involved in planning?", "NTA.  So sorry for the upheaval in your growing up years.  Sounds like both the major adults initially responsible for you let you down. \n\nI'm also sorry that what happened (or in this case maybe more like what didn't happen) between you and your mother still troubles you greatly.  While it may be time to try to mend some of that (for your own sense of wellbeing and hers), I can appreciate that it is a complicated situation and requires not just you but also your mother's cooperation.  Clearly what happened to you still haunts you, understandably.\n\nYour sister needs to accept that you simply aren't comfortable being placed that closely to your mother.  You made this clear from the beginning.  She might think she is forcing some sort of reconciliation, but this is not the way that needs to play out.  Since she did not keep her end of the bargain, you are in no way the AH for needing to back out of participating.  \n\nSorry it feels that your relatives are ganging up against you on this too.  Abandonment and whatever else happened is not a minor thing and takes so much to overcome.  Only those who have been there truly understand that.", "YTA just because you don\u2019t want a relationship with your mother doesn\u2019t mean others have to do the same \n\nYou can\u2019t avoid your mother forever what a better way to reconnect than at your sisters wedding \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to reconnect after the wedding you can go no contact again if you think it\u2019ll solve anything", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
