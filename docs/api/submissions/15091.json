Just as you are, she is also experiencing a whirlpool of emotions. \n\nThere are no sides to be taken. Just as you love your father, your wife loves you.   \nEveryone is stuck in an impossible situation.", "NAH. This is a horrendous situation for everyone. I'm not surprised your wife is terrified at the thought of you going back after what happened on your last visit. I also can't begrudge you wanting to see your Father, perhaps for the last time. There's no winning this one I'm afraid.", "NAH it's a shitty situation, and no one's fault other than Putin.\n\nI have no advice for you, on how you can resolve this, I understand both your points of view.\n\nI wish you the very very best, for you, for your family in Ukraine and in the USA, and for Ukraine itself.", "NAH. I don't have words to convey how sorry I am that you, your family and your country are going through this.", "This is a shitty situation all round. I can understand after what happened last time that your wife is scared and perhaps lashing out because she's terrified. I can also see why you feel it's an acceptable risk considering the location and limited time left with your Dad. \n\nI'm not even sure there's a possible compromise to be had. Unless maybe you'd all be amenable to a very short visit with constant check-ins. \n\nI'm sorry OP, there's no easy answer here. NAH.", "NAH, it sucks. She has every reason to be afraid for your safety, like you've said. You're both in a hard place.", "NAH and I\u2019m sorry for this situation. Truly awful. But what happens if you are injured or killed. Think of your kids in this situation too. You have responsibilities to them and they are still young.", "NAH. I can see both of your point, you wanting to see your dying father, your wife not wanting to risk your life, especially when you have kids together.\n\n  \nHowever, is there really no way how to transport your parents from the country? Your father could probably receive tretment in other country as well and you would not have to risk going there. Your parents would also have a chance to be with their grandkids. That seems like the best solution, honestly.", "NAH. 23 people were killed in the July attack, of course your wife\u2019s going to be desperately worried about you going back. \n\nRisk is a highly personalised thing; you\u2019ve looked at the benefits of seeing your dad versus the danger and feel the benefit outweighs the risk. Your wife does the same calculation and comes out with a different answer - for her the risk of being widowed and your kids losing their dad is too much. If it was your wife who was going you might both be doing the calculation and coming up with each other\u2019s results.", "NAH: Your wife is scared. Rightly so. She loves you and doesn't want to lose you.\n\nYou love your Dad and want to be with him before he passes.\n\nI'm so sorry. You are in an untenable place.", "NAH. This is a value judgment.\n\nSorry for your divorce.", "As a Pole... NAH. You wife is understandably concerned, but your concern about your parents is as valid as hers. I have no advice for you, though. Good luck and all the best for your family.", "NAH. \n\nIt\u2019s understandable that she has concerns about the father of her two children going to an area where, while the odds are insanely low, there\u2019s a greater than typical chance you might not come back when you compare it to a work trip to Paris or a car ride to the grocery store to pick up milk. I\u2019m sure whenever you\u2019re there it\u2019s all she can think about and the prospect of raising two young kids alone is probably terrifying not even mentioning the pain and suffering she\u2019d face losing her spouse. I doubt there\u2019s a tolerable level of risk that\u2019s acceptable when it comes to that. \n\nThen again, it\u2019s your father. Like I said NAH, but keep in mind you\u2019re a father yourself and you shouldn\u2019t discount the fear your wife has about you putting yourself at risk, low or otherwise, when you have people that depend on you here just as your own mother depended on your father when you were your children\u2019s age (not to mention how much you yourself needed your father at 11)", "NAH, it's just a bad situation, both of you have good reason, it's not you or your wife fault", "This this a tough one. I\u2019m going to say NAH but with a caveat. Right now the place where your parents are seems far enough away from the conflict so might be arguably safer to visit. That being said, most places are advising against all but essential travel to Ukraine. Should the situation change where your parents are and become more violent and prone to attack, I\u2019d say it would be more of an AH reason to go. \n\nYou need to consider your wife and children here. Are you the sole breadwinner? Do you have life insurance in place should something happen to you that would pay off any debts, mortgage and ease the financial burden on them. Please do bear in mind that even with life insurance in place, there can be policy exclusions so freely traveling to a war zone could end up with the policy not paying out in the event of death. \n\nAnother thing to consider is are you at risk of conscription? If you are then this goes from NAH to a Y T A. \n\nEqually your wife isn\u2019t an AH here. She\u2019s likely to be worried sick. Worried about you dying or not being able to come home. Your immediate responsibility is to your wife and children. Her reaction whilst harsh, is likely from a place of fear and no doubt anger at the risks you are taking. Im not agreeing with what she said but I do see where her reaction is coming from. I think your wife maybe feels that you have been brushing her off and not listening to her asking and pleading with you not to go and that maybe she feels that this is the only way to get you to listen. You do need to realise that each time you travel to Ukraine, there is a chance you won\u2019t return. Your decision to go there impacts your entire family. Your wife may be left without her husband and your kids without a father. \n\nIt\u2019s admirable that you want to help care for your parents and likely feel helpless being so far apart. I have to ask, what do your parents think of you risking everything like this to see them? Have you asked them what they think? Is there any feasible way for your parents to get to Poland to continue treatment. I do understand that he may not be well enough to travel and it\u2019s likely to be riskier for him to get to the safety of Poland whilst unwell. I get that you will feel guilt and upset at not being able to visit your father but please consider how your wife and kids will feel if they have to live a life without you. Consider how your parents will feel if you died whilst visiting them. This is a hard one OP. Right now NAH but honestly I think it\u2019s too dangerous to risk.", "YTA.\n\nUnless your presence is going to change your parent\u2019s outcome - you are just fulfilling your own familial needs at a potentially life destroying cost to your family.\n\nAt a bare minimum please take out a $1 - 2 million life insurance policy on yourself with your wife as the beneficiary. So she is covered till the kids grow up.\n\nAlso - I know I sounds harsh - but I have tremendous empathy for your circumstance and hate that you are in this difficult position.", "I am sorry you even have to make that decision. NAH Just a bad situation all around. If you have not already get some life insurance and make sure it pays if you die in Ukraine. If you refuse to protect yourself then at least protect your family. Money cannot replace you but at least your family will be take care of if the worse happens.", "YTA. \n\n\"It can't happen to *me*\" is all I'm getting when I read your post. And that's nonsense. \n\nWhat if you'd been closer to this? \n\n> When I went in July last year there was a huge missile strike in the city and I actually saw a missile hit the road and burn a lot of cars.\n\nYou wouldn't be posting right now. Your parents would be mourning their dead son, *and* your widow and children would be lamenting your loss.", "YTA, you\u2019re responsibility to your wife and children is far greater than to your parents. Stay home, take care of your kids.", "Nah I imagine your wife is terrified for you.", "esh\n\nim sorry but the real truth is that there is a possibility that you could be killed\n\ni understand your parents are there, but your wife and 2 children depend on you and you going shows that your life means nothing to you\n\ni would take your wifes threat seriously and think if they mean more to you than your parents but she should not hold that against you\n\nyou wrote that your father is dying, imagine how your two children would feel if you got killed", "Slava Ukreini ! first of all. NTA- this is a choice only you and your wife can make- not us. There is danger involved, but there could be so much resentment if you don't go.", "NTA, but you need to sit and talk with your wife and help her understand. Don't dismiss her fear and don't minimalize it, but be rational and practical. You could die if you go there, even if it is outside immediate combat zones - have you arranged insurance that will take care of your kids and family if this happens? Have you organized your finances and paperwork? Have your american family met your parents prior to the war?", "NTA I would do the same thing. I hope your wife is not serious and is just being emotional. My husband\u2019s parents visited dying parents in the country of Macedonia when there was a lot of bad stuff going on (not as bad as Ukraine) but they would have regretted not going and being able to say goodbye. You have to go with your gut on what you feel is best. And as for leaving you and taking kids, I don\u2019t think that would hold up in court.", "NTA\n\nThough I do understand her perspective. Threatening divorce because you want to visit your dying dad is messed up. I also trust that your family would tell you if it was too dangerous to visit.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if your wife would actually stick to her word and divorce you, but if she would, then it\u2019s time to weigh out your options and see if you\u2019d still go or not.\n\nMaybe if you sat down with her and had a true heart to heart about the matter she\u2019d understand your perspective? I\u2019m sorry man. I hope she comes around and I wish your father the best! I also hope all of y\u2019all stay safe :)", "NTA - have you purchased life insurance to ease your wife's morid concerns?", "NTA. Your wife needs to be more accepting and understanding.", "I was going to say No AH until I read the last sentence. I understand your spouse is frightened but to threaten divorce and to take away your kids is cruel. It is incredibly lonely to be isolated from your birth family, especially given your father\u2019s illnesses. NTA", "Your wife is not making any sense. And acting a bit selfish. Eastern Ukraine is relatively safe. She doesn\u2019t want you to go because she\u2019s afraid of losing you but threatens with a divorce which is also losing you. This isn\u2019t how families behave. Would she want her kids to grow up without any care for their parents?", "Nta is it possible you could bring him to America with you? Or would you disrupt his treatments that way?", "NAH. \n\nI think she\u2019s an AH for threatening to take your children away because you want to see your dying father. She\u2019s intentionally trying to be manipulative.", "NAT OP it sucks being in a situation like that. I hope your parents are doing well. I will say if you are meeting them choose a place that is safe to meet for civilians.", "NTA -- and in the US it is highly unlikely she can get sole custody of the kids", "NTA.  You are going to see your parents, one who is essentially dying.  Some risks are worth taking.  I can empathize with your wife not wanting you to go, but again.. some risks are worth taking, and you are the one taking them.  We only get so long on this planet, and only so long with people we love and care about, once that time is up, its up. Each determines what that time is worth to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the flip side of that.. I hear that the Ukrainians are prone to trapping able bodied men in the country, the forcing conscription into their military regardless of national origin.  I don't even like the idea of my country sending Ukraine pallets of our money to fight their war, let alone the idea of being forced into their conflict that has nothing to do with me, granted you are originally Ukrainian I assume, and patriotic so it may not be as much of a quandry for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Wife is not in the wrong for wanting her husband to be safe and not risk their children losing a father, just like how OP is not in the wrong for wanting to see his dying father. To say that the wife needs to be more understanding is disregarding her perspective in this situation which is totally valid.", ">but to threaten divorce and to take away your kids is cruel\n\nI mean OP saw a literal missile blow up near him. He was just lucky he didn't make his wife a widow and his kids orphans. The wife just can't take it anymore. It's a horrible situation all around.", "Yep. Op needs to go to couples counselling with his wife to talk this through. Hopefully, the wife can develop coping strategies to deal with her anxiety about this. Depending on how aware of the situation in Ukraine, the kids may benefit from some therapy. Op needs to be arranging support for the wife whikst he's gone (pre cooking meals, childcare, emotional support from friends/family, etc).\n\nI do wonder if there are other elements at play re the divorce, but a court won't take his kids away because he travels to a country at war to visit his sickly parents.\n\nI would expect op already has but jic, they should look into humanitarian organisations that can safely move medical patients and transport them to another country where they can receive  treatment. Also, utilise the consulates.", "\"Relatively safe\" when OP was there while there was a large missile strike and could have died?

She's worried and sad and scared and that's the thing about emotions. You can't expect her to think rationally when she's obviously in turmoil - thinking about her husband, their kids and their future.\n\nHer husband wants to visit his parents without heeding his own safety. You could say \"fuck outta here with his demands of leaving without carrying for his wife's concerns\" -- But that wouldn't be right.\n\nWhat matters at the end of the day is them having an adult discussion about all possible outcomes of this situation. Which can only happen when the onslaught push of emotions has passed.\n\nYou can't base your decision on split-second choices.", "You clearly have no fucking idea what it means to be a partner or a parent so why don't you sit this one out.", "So she's being emotionally manipulative by trying to \"persuade him by using this extreme ultimatum,\" and that's fine? As the original reply said, this is not a rational way to handle the situation if you're the wife, even if she has plenty of reason to whole-heartedly oppose her husband's plan."]}
