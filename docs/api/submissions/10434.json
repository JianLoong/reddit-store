But it's clear that neither parent here is actually willing to parent. One is absent, and the other is a doormat. OP was filling in out of necessity. It was absolutely warranted to establish boundaries in her home. \n\nShe should have yelled at the kid and his mother earlier. The mother should also be on the hook for replacing everything her kid broke.... but I suppose OP should just cut her losses and take away what she's learned about her relatives' characters.\n\nI'm curious, though, OP: How did your mother react to the whole situation?", "At 3 he knows better", "These lessons are really good if you were talking to the parent.  But you\u2019re not, you\u2019re talking to the OP who is 17 years old and should not have had to deal with this parent and child. OP was fed up with the kid and screamed at the kid once. That\u2019s not abuse.", "Thos exactly go for a walk or something", "No. I'm against yelling and physical discipline in most cases. But do you think a constantly malicious, destructive kid that screams and breaks things will stop just because you nicely ask? You have to set the impression that this is highly unacceptable and it will have consequences, and yelling in this case perfectly does that job.", "He probably doesn\u2019t because he wasn\u2019t taught better. He\u2019s been able to act like this and get away with it so he doesn\u2019t see an issue.\nI have a 3 yo as well but he doesn\u2019t act like this. And when he does throw a tantrum or try to break things or disrespect people, we use that moment to correct and teach. He may not know better while he\u2019s doing it but we try to use those moments so he can learn.", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s not the child\u2019s fault his parent doesn\u2019t do her job. It sounds like his mother ever tried any form of redirection or discipline, so you don\u2019t know if that would work or not", "You realize people here come from all kinds of places and in many languages a word that might translate to \"it\" would be perfectly fine and normal for small children?\nNot everything is a grand moral cause, cool your jets."]}
