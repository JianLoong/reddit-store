If you're a guest in someone else's house, then you have to be extra considerate of the people that live there.", "NTA and it sounds like there are bigger issues with mom and son. Someone needs to set boundaries and discipline with the kid because it is severely lacking. It also sounds like mom needs to get her shit together and provide an actual home for her son. \n\nI\u2019m sure the kid has heard a lot worse. You\u2019re fine.", "NTA but your aunt certainly is.", "NTA I agree kids can be annoying at times especially when the mother is enabling this behaviour. Although I understand where youre coming from a more calmer approach would be better for a 3 year old. But seeing that now theyre out of your business it was the right call.", "Dude I don't care what other people say, I back you up 100%. Maybe yelling wasn't exactly the best way but I would probably done the same thing out of frustration. Good riddance and I'm glad they left so easily on their own.", "NTA, not to sound heartless, but I'm pretty sure I can guess what your aunt's mother argued with her about and why she was kicked out.", "NTA, given the context.  It would have been best if his mother actually did her job and showed her son the proper way to behave.  But she refused to do it, you yelled at him, he shut up, and they left.", "NTA \n\nI hate people who say \u201cyou have no right to say anything to my child\u201d but then themselves won\u2019t do shit about it. You did your best and beggars can\u2019t be choosers. She\u2019s living with family, she should respect you, your mother and the sanctity of your home.\n\nGood riddance", "NTA, \nOk so it's not at all the child's fault for not being disaplined by the mother but your tired and frustrating and angry etc etc I don't at all blame you for breaking and yelling at the child. \nAt the end of the day no harm was done to it by just yelling.\nDon't beat yourself up for having a moment of frustration, your not hurt and neither is anyone else.", "NTA- hopefully someone 10 years younger than your aunt having to parent her toddler for her gave her the wake up call she needed. Kid is doomed with a mom like that", "NTA.  I applaud you for getting rid of his problem.  As for yelling at the kid, I have a very short fuse with kids (never had any of my own) and I can totally empathize with you.  That kid is a brat and that's how his mom is raising him.  In 3 or 4 more weeks he would have destroyed everything in your home at the rate he was going.\n\nAnyway, whatever you had to do to get rid of them is okay with me.", "NTA \n\nAlso the fact it worked on the little shit suggests he just needs some boundaries", "NTA I\u2019m probably gonna get downvoted but I would have yelled at him too and way before you did tbh. Your aunt is the asshole and she\u2019s in for a rough ride. Some people shouldn\u2019t have kids", "NTA!\n\nI'm actually certain that I would have snapped even earlier lol \n\nI'm sure you mom was lowkey glad you yelled at him haha", "I mean YTA for yelling at the child instead of the person whose fault this all is-- his mom.\n\nI don't blame you though, that sounds hellish.\n\nEither way, she's gone, so.", "NTA", "The very softest of YTA, because it is still a 3 year old. If anything, I'd have yelled at the mom.  \n\nBut good riddance!!! It may not have been the best solution, but you got results. They needed to go.", "ESH\n\nYour aunt isn't being a good parent. Children don't inherently know right from wrong, they need to be taught and redirected. By allowing him to do whatever without any intervention, she was teaching him that his actions were okay. \n\nI understand that you were frustrated and fed up, but your anger was misdirected. You shouldn't have told a 3 year old to stfu. He doesn't know what he's doing is unacceptable because his mom hasn't taught him that.", "Swearing and using the F word towards a child really makes you an asshole but their mother should discipline them for their behavior.", "His mum sucks but you\u2019re also TA. you\u2019re talking about this literal toddler like he\u2019s intentionally being a dick when he\u2019s literally just a child feeling unsettled", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
