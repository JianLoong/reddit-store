If you bring a toddler into someone else's home, you are responsible for having them fit into the household. If they are up at 6, and no one else is, it is up to the parent to keep them occupied and quiet.", "Yelling at a toddler for misbehaving is OK. It's a common part of discipline that they need. If they don't get negative (and sometimes harsh) feedback on their bad behavior, then they turn out like this kid. Three year olds are old enough to learn the basics of good behavior and accept judicious correction without being scared for life.\n\nIt should come from the parents. But it's clear that neither parent here is actually willing to parent. One is absent, and the other is a doormat. OP was filling in out of necessity. It was absolutely warranted to establish boundaries in her home. \n\nShe should have yelled at the kid and his mother earlier. The mother should also be on the hook for replacing everything her kid broke.... but I suppose OP should just cut her losses and take away what she's learned about her relatives' characters.\n\nI'm curious, though, OP: How did your mother react to the whole situation?", "At 3 he knows better", "These lessons are really good if you were talking to the parent.  But you\u2019re not, you\u2019re talking to the OP who is 17 years old and should not have had to deal with this parent and child. OP was fed up with the kid and screamed at the kid once. That\u2019s not abuse.", "Thos exactly go for a walk or something", "No. I'm against yelling and physical discipline in most cases. But do you think a constantly malicious, destructive kid that screams and breaks things will stop just because you nicely ask?

As she continues to ignore him, not just his behavior, he upped the ante each time trying to get her attention. It\u2019s so sad when a parent is unwilling to engage with, and parent their child, giving him a roadmap for being happy and safe. A three-year-old is going to continue to act out in this case because they feel very unsafe. He doesn\u2019t know what the bottom line is in any situation.\n\nI would not of use the F word, but I also haven\u2019t been woken up by him seven days in a row and living with that behavior all day long.

Your aunt should be replacing all the items her uncivilized child (I don't blame the child, it's your aunt's fault) breaks and apologizing profusely while doing so.

These things take time and most people really don\u2019t put much effort into it with kids who don\u2019t have problems, so it\u2019s especially challenging when there are problems. \n\nThis mom and her kid are just bouncing from place to place in fight or flight mode and nobody is really actually being understanding or helping the situation, but that\u2019s mainly because it doesn\u2019t seem like any of them are qualified either or really understand what to do.", "This constant so I imagine this has been a pretty consistent Problem and mother has checked out before this recent trauma of home Issues.", ">NTA, I agree, woman can\u2019t control her kid, and she is in someone else\u2019s house.

A three year old shouldn't be allowed to act like that and after a week of screaming I don't think you'd be faring much better.\n\nWas is the best way to handle the situation? no.

They can barely walk. You can forget about a capacity to judge the wants of other people. But yelling one loud succinct \"STFU!\" is not abuse in any shape or form.

I completely agree. However, you still can't deny that at a point that this kid reached, this kind of discipline was necessary. You're correct in that if it hadn't ever come to this point through good parenting, then yelling at them to shut the fuck up would not be okay. However, that isn't how it is, so it was necessary. Yes, it's not the kids fault they're a brat. But they're still one and as such need an according discipline. Maybe once they get disciplined harsher they'll be more inclined to be more calm and thus more reasonable measures such as communication would be open.
