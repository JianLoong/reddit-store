Unless of course you paid by credit card? Then you can do a chargeback or if it was paypal you can open a case to get the remainder back. \n\nStrange for her to block you though, perhaps do a search on her and see if anyone else has had such issues with her, for all you know she could be a scam artist who does this to people on a regular basis.", "NTA - But your family has a point, perhaps not \"be happy with a partial refund\", but is the mental angst worth running after this baker for $100.", "NTA. Definitely NTA. I'm a firm believer in you get what you pay for. In this case, you absolutely did not get what you paid for. Not only was she late, but she didn't give you the cakepops that you ordered and paid for AND gave you a cake you didn't order. That calls for a full refund. If she blocked you on everything, leave reviews wherever you can. Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, Google etc to not only prevent other people from having the same bad experience, but she might reach out to you to get you to remove them which gives you a chance to request a full refund. It's unacceptable.", "NTA. Share your experience on local FB mom groups so they are aware not to use her.", "NTA. She did not deliver as promised. She's the AH.", "NTA but I think you have to accept the loss. Since BIL said he knows her personally and wanted to help her build her business, perhaps he can find out how she\u2019s attracting customers; if she has reviews somewhere. The most you can do is spread the word about her. Luckily 2 year olds love cake in any form.", "Bad review everywhere!", "NTA\n\n>I went with a new girl that was recommended to be for the dessert.\n\nIf you want what you want, go with someone with a track record, not a friend of a friend someone recommended.", "Yes! You can dispute on venmo- or send her a strongly worded email text that you will give her terrible reviews to everyone you know and that you would like your $100 back and that she needs to find some professionalism.", "NTA. She did not deliver what you agreed upon - both the items and the time it was to be delivered - and she knew it. Unfortunately, you made the mistake of paying full in advance, which leaves you fewer options.", "NTA- it kinda seems like she waited till day of to do any prep, and got in over her head. I\u2019d be mad too, and want my money back. \n\nI\u2019d ask BIL if he\u2019s ever personally used her service, and if not, he should be aware of the services he\u2019s recommending because they\u2019re not up to par. \n\nIn the future (and this is NOT me saying this is on you- just a way to weed out future frauds) consider asking for pictures of their former work? And google reverse image search to make sure those pictures aren\u2019t stolen!\n\nI think the $100 is prolly a wash, but tell BIL, review her on FB groups and any site she has a listing. The fact that she blocked you on everything is telling.", "NTA, take her to small claims - hopefully you took.pbotos of what was delivered.", "NTA, though it's probably not worth it to chase the $100. I'd tell your BIL she botched it though so he knows who he's vouching for. And post it publicly on socials and name her and her business/@ her or her business account if you can. People should know what they're paying for if they look her up.", "NTA\u2026and use social media. Post pictures of what you wanted and what you got and the unprofessionalism of the baker.", "If you paid with a credit card then do a charge back. If you have the text messages you can ss them and include them in the claim.  Pictures as well.  She'll get charge the full price plus $25-50 for her fuckery.", "Small claims court. As someone who loves to bake that\u2019s so ridiculous. NTA.", "Nta I say small claims court.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSue her. and have someone else describe it on social media.", "You ate part of the cake and then threw it away instead of returning it, but want a full refund.
