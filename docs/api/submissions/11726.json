You can teach him how to cook healthy meals, portion sizes, y\u2019all can research together how many calories he needs to lose weight, try out new healthy dishes with him, etc. You can also just see if he would like to start going for a regular walk with you for you two to just catch up and talk. \n\nNTA, you are right to be concerned about his health and you are right that he will have more luck with dating at a healthier weight.

He knows he's out of shape just like I did but you can't change until you want to no one can do it for you.  Things my dad did that were actually helpful was offer to pay for anything that would help me lose weight, so when I was motivated he paid for a nutritionist and a gym membership and that was helpful since I was in my 20s and couldn't have afforded it and at the time I had reached kind of my all time high weight and I lost 35 pounds.

It causes tremendous amounts of health problems throughout life and often shortens lifespans to boot.

You want your son to be healthier and in shape, just find a different avenue to address it, not his dating life. That can cause long term, even permanent damage, not only to him, but your relationship. Especially if he is soft (sensitive?) also. \n\nGood luck, OP! Maybe you\u2019ll be learning a new sport soon! \n\nSincerely,\nAn adult hockey player :)", "NTA. There's absolutely nothing wrong with telling your son that he should lead a healthy lifestyle. Every person should ideally exercise, just like every person should ideally eat healthy, sleep well and socialize. These are basic requirements. If I was in your situation, I would first explore as many exercise options as possible with my son and let him tell me which one he liked the most. Get him to try jogging, swimming, biking, playing sports, doing martial arts etc. And also figure out if he is more of a team player or if he likes to exercise solo.\n\nAfter you will know which type of exercise is the best for him, make it as easy as possible for him to do the exercise. For example, if he likes biking the most, don't wait for him to save up enough money to buy a bike himself and just buy it for him. Then I would tie the activity of biking to someone he can admire. Show him cool YouTube videos of professional bikers winning competitions or doing tricks. If he is more of a nerdy type, explain to him how cool it would be if he was not only intelligent but also physically fit. Tie the activity of riding a bike to having success with girls. If he appreciates science, look up scientific studies that show that people who exercise live longer and are at a much lower risk for diseases than people who don't exercise and also tell him that exercise improves a person's concentration because it gets more blood pumping into the brain, which would greatly benefit him during any of his more nerdy interests.\n\nAnd lastly, you could experiment with rewards and punishments. Tell him that for each minute he spends excercising he can spend 3 minutes on a computer or something like that. There are so many ways to get someone to like exercising. Also, if he made a friend who has a similar personality to him but who already regularly exercises that would really motivate him. He's probably not motivated by seeing people with completely different personalities exercise, but if he saw someone who's more similar to him do it, he would take it as a challenge.", "Fat people get married and have kids all the time. It's not his weight.. he needs therapy.", "NTA. Sadly that\u2019s reality. Most girls his age will pass him if he is not deemed attractive. It doesn\u2019t mean that there is no one out there that will look pass the lack of physical attributes. What it should be a real concern is his health. Suggest a whole physical check up. Maybe that will motivate him to eat better and exercise more. Could he have depression? One of the most common symptoms is being overweight and lack of interest for one\u2019s well being.", "YTA You are right to be concerned about his health but this is not the way to go about it. You should encourage him to be healthier for its own sake, so he feels better.\n\nYou should not tell him he has to lose weight and get fit to get a girlfriend. What if he never does lose weight?

I would try and educate him on how his low activity lifestyle is going to only cause larger issues down the road and now is the time to set good habits rather than trying to undo years of damage when the adverse effects start to pile up.

It can be something as simple as traveling to a new city, either in the same country or in another country, and having the energy to go walking around all day and explore.

Studies have also shown that physical exercise can have a positive impact on brain health, as well. \n\nThere's so many reasons to want to be fit.\n\nEdit: it seems like a lot of people responding to this post needed a dad like you.", "YTA for tying romantic relationships to physical conditioning.  Here's the thing though, you're coming from a place of love.  What partners are attracted to is confidence.
