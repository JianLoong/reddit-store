The proper way is to use your words first and then if that does not work you can tap them on the shoulder? Touching both arms in an attempt to move them is unnecessary and excessive.", "I think this is a move every guy over 50 does when they are trying to move passed someone. I am a 25 year old guy, and I was out at a restaurant with friends, and a guy who was about late 50\u2019s put his hands on my shoulders, and said, \u201cgonna sneak by ya, buddy\u201d.

These are some REAL first world problems", "YTA\n1: Your clothing doesn't matter, so wtf?\n\n2: You sound like you think you're the main character.\n\nIf you were a guy, you would have just been pushed to the side for being an asshole for standing in the way as if the world revolves around you.\n\nWhat are you sick of? People not accepting your entitled arrogant bullshit?", "I don't think there is enough info here. I mean, is it possible he asked you and you didn't hear him? No person should be touched if the intent is to violate space or dignity but in a crowded or loud area there are also other variables", "NAH. You should be aware of your surroundings if you don\u2019t want to be touched in a crowded place where someone might be trying to get by you.\n\nNo, he shouldn\u2019t have touched you but if you don\u2019t want to be touched at all don\u2019t stand where people are walking.\n\nWhy did you mention how you were dressed?

Yes he shouldn't have touched you, but it seems like it was truly harmless to get you out of the way. And you have every right to ask him not to touch you, but by saying \"please don't touch me\" it seems like you made it weird by making it seem like it was more than to just move out of the way. Your age and clothing imo have nothing to do with what happened. Now if you say he was staring at you for a while, or he touched you more than once. Okay, I'd be fully on your side, but at least me personally I don't think it was to cause you harm or discomfort. His response to you was a bit rude, but it was because your \"please don't touch me\" made him feel like he was a pervert or something.", "YTA - Don\u2019t be so precious, you\u2019re not that special.", "YTA get a grip", "YTA - You were in a shared area and blocked a space that people pass through.

I'm not sure why your choice of clothing matters in you being impolite in public and that's what swayed me. It feels like you added that piece of needless information in as a \"ew he touched you\" distraction from the fact you were rude.\n\nEdit - instant downvote, seems like OP doesn't want our opinions unless they agree with her own.", "First off touching someone\u2019s arms is not the same as grabbing someone\u2019s arms. My husband and I were out at our favorite dive bar tonight and I had several different men and women touch my arms from behind while shouting  out excuse me! so I could step FORWARD out of their way. I have done the same to people myself. Crowded bars are often loud and people don\u2019t pay attention to a stranger talking to them even if they are saying excuse me. The reason why I touch both arms is because it lets them know I am directly behind them so they don\u2019t turn and step back into to me which has happened numerous times in the past. If it bothers you that much don\u2019t stand around a crowded bar or find a seat and stay there. I\u2019d rather have someone touch my arm to let me know they want to pass by than push through me.", "NAH\n\nShit like this happens all the time in crowded bars. As a man I've had this happen tons of times. People are tipsy, drunk or high and aren't as subtle as they usually are. You are probably the 80th person who 'got in the way' that night.\n\nThis is not a power move, this has nothing to do with gender. This is actually 10 times better than the assholes who just bump you and push through.", "I don\u2019t know if YTA, but your reaction strikes me as super obnoxious and unnecessarily aggressive.  I don\u2019t know why he touched both of your arms but if it was a very loud bar I would expect that he would have either had to yell loudly and/or at least tap you on the shoulder to get you to move.", "Touching someones arm while moving past them is normal. Its so that person knows your there and they dont bump into you. I assume it was crowded, so him touching both arms is so he can squeeze past you while making sure you dont fall over. Its just being polite.", "Yes. You're in a crowded bar, expect to be either moved or used as stability for older people. Double yes because this person's intent wasn't to actually interact with you in any way, but rather just to get past you.\n\nYou just wanted to assert your personal space over someone else after being pointed out as in the way. It was a egocentric move and your request for affirmation here is just more of the same.", "YTA this is a basic human interaction for a loud bar. Grow up", "I suffer from the same thing you do\u2026.the, \u201c I\u2019m oblivious to everyone else and stand where I feel like\u201d thing. You are the AH. You said it was loud. You said you were in the way. Maybe he had said something several times but you couldn\u2019t hear or ignored him. Maybe he had been drinking all night and couldn\u2019t hold his urine, as old people do.", "YTA. Loud bar, you likely weren\u2019t responding to more polite gestures. The double arm grab being equated to sexual harassment is such a Reddit take. Get some real problems. \n\nSource: I am a 25 year old woman.", "In New York if you\u2019re in the way you shall be moved. I think it\u2019s polite he said something", "YTA\n\nWhat dont you understand on the concept of non-verbal communication through touch, in very loud and noisy environment, where the easiest form on getting simply things like \"please move a bit ouf othe the way\" across is just simply by touching the person on a neutral spot.\n\nYou sound like the typcial 22yo these days. Big Yikes. Youngsters like you piss me off to no end :)", "YTA. He didnt groop you.", "YATA!!!\n\nGet OVER your self. Loud bar. Go stand in the corner or sit down  or do not go to busy places if you do not want to be moved out of the way which is normal behavior. I bet it was your type of person it would be different right. The \"older\" gentleman part here is the operative word.", "YTA. Stop making mountains out of molehills. \n\nAs a woman I will continue to place a hand on people\u2019s back as I squeeze past them in noisy environments because it\u2019s the polite thing to do. Just barging past is far ruder.", "I don't like being touched by strangers so I don't go to places where I might be touched by strangers. \n\nIf it's a loud bar and he can't make you hear him then what choice does he have?\n\nYTA", "NTA. I work at a bar and understand well that people won't hear me while i walk around cleaning, restocking, etc. I often start by asking them to let me through. If they dont hear me, I ask louder or give them a tap on the shoulder. But for the most parts I just find a gap and slide through. Grabbing with both arms is super uncomfortable  and, like others, have mentioned a power move.", "YTA. It sounds like you\u2019re purposely positioning yourself in a crowded club, so you can stand in the way and complain when someone touches you, so you can get attention and a feeling of empowerment. Then to feel even more empowered, you make it a big deal and post about it on Reddit. The guy even said \u201cexcuse me\u201d for Christ\u2019s sake. You\u2019re obviously not telling the story as it really played out.", "people replying have never been to a pub the correct way is to wip it out to show dominance.", "Tbh I'd say YTA as that's the way I and many other people get others to move when in a crowded place. Nothing is meant by it.", "If he just moved you, nothing else, then YTA. He wasn't being creepy, it's more like he was pissed. Maybe it was because of you, or maybe he was pissed before; there's no way to know. But if he just moved you, touching you only for the time needed to pass, you overreacted.", "NTA and what are these comments. Don't go to loud bars if you don't want a dude to touch you without your consent? Do you think men regularly rub other men's arms, touch their lower backs, or physically move them out of the way when they can't pass? \n\nPeople (probably guys) commenting don't get it. It's gross and creepy for strange men to touch you all the time.\n\nOP, you are always justified in asking anyone not to touch you. And if you somehow didn't hear him, he should have spoken up or tapped you on the shoulder briefly, not rubbed/grabbed your bare arms.", "YTA. You\u2019re in a crowded bar. And this \u201cdon\u2019t touch me\u201d crap is out of control. Touching is not violence or assault. You were rude and entitled. What happens when you choke on something and nobody helps because \u201cdon\u2019t touch me\u201d has scared everyone off? Instead of being an entitled brat, how about making a joke about it to get your point across? \u201cHey, normally you would have to buy me a drink first before that happens.\u201d  And smile. He would still realize maybe it was too far for YOU, but you weren\u2019t an entitled brat who stood in the way. This attitude nowadays of expecting everyone to know YOUR boundaries instantly, is sooo self indulgent. And then being just plain rude about it. Do you know what rude is? It\u2019s a way for a weak person to pretend to be stronger. And it doesn\u2019t work. Grow up.", "I'm split on this one. If he had already tried to get your attention and you didn't notice, then yes, YTA for being oblivious and being in the way. If he just grabbed your arms first, then NTA.", "YTA, loud bar, what would you rather have him do? Scream as loud as he can for you to move? Have you ever been to a loud bar before? People tap you on the arm/shoulder all the time if it's crowded and they want to move past you, that is the polite thing to do.", "Let's see... did he do it more than once? Did he hold on to you, never wanting to actually to past you? Did he try to make conversation with you? \n\nIf all the dude wanted was to get past you then YTA. It's a loud bar, you wouldn't have heard a fuck behind you and no one has spidey-senses to feel when someone is behind them so touching is quite a normal reflex to do when trying to get someone's attention \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nTo those in the comments saying its some sort of power move or whatever... do you ever realise the way you unconsciously touch someone you want to move?

Am I hitting on them then when I already have a boyfriend? \n\nAnd I don't do any difference between guy and girl. If I need to move, I'm not gonna stand there like a statue until you finally realise someone's calling out to you...

You are too self conscious.", "NTA\n\nWhile I understand that sometimes in a loud/crowded environment it's hard to be heard, you have a right to not be touched without your consent.  Even had he tapped your shoulder to get your attention, that would be (IMO) preferred to grabbing both your arms.", "NTA at all. I know others have said that perhaps he tried to ask you to move and you didn't hear him, but even if that's true his next move should have been to tap your shoulder, not GRAB BOTH YOUR BARE ARMS. Unacceptable on his part.", "YTA. This is being blown insanely out of proportion. I have both touched and been touched by people of both genders in exactly the way you described to clear an obstructed path. Its a very common gesture that implies \"hey you're in my way, here's me communicating that clearly, while ensuring I don't shove you out of the way\"", "YTA. In crowded places there is always contact. If you don't like that, don't go.", "NTA - I am personally so uncomfortable with being touched even by people I know so this is a big Nono for me. \n\nA similar situation happened to my coworker where she stepped back and didn\u2019t realise a man fixing something was there and he legit touched her waist and she looked at him and just went \u201cdo *not* touch me.\u201d And he tried to use the excuse that she stepped backwards but there\u2019s ways to avoid touching women if you really want to.", "Yta don\u2019t stand in the way then and it\u2019s not like he assaulted you and the next time they should just push you away", "YTA, most likely.    Depends on a few things.   1) were you in the middle of the pathway?   2). You said it was a noisy bar, are you sure that he didn\u2019t ask you to move and you just didn\u2019t hear him and therefore could have appeared to be ignoring his request for you to move?  3) Did you apologize for being in their way?", "YTA", "YTA! He's right.

Don't go to dive bars if small interactions like this bother you.\n\nIt's small, it's cramped, you are lucky if you have more than 10cm space around you free. So you standing in the way like a dum dum and then getting pissy about someone moving you makes you the arsehole.\n\nYour age is irrelevant, you chose your own clothes. \n\nEnd of it is you were being inconsiderate by standing in the way.

Have you ever in your life seen any man do this to another man?", "That is a little too touchy. If someone needs to get a strangers attention in a loud crowded environment, a shoulder tap is appropriate. No need to go both hands on, and your response was appropriate.

People are going to move past you and may touch you accidentally or on purpose to get past you. \n\nI think you\u2019re reading into this too much. If he had touched you somewhere inappropriate then fair enough but it\u2019s seems innocent and like a guy trying to just get through a crowd.", "NTA and I do not understand other comments here.

Double arm is just creepy", "NTA. Don't fucking touch strangers folks.", "Yta. Thats common in bars and he wasnt doing or saying anything inappropriate. People calling it a power move are reading too deep", "Oh man, get over it. You completely overreacted to it. You\u2019re taking that emo sh*t too seriously.", "NTA - I hate it when people do this, just say excuse me or tap your shoulder if it was loud.

You did mention that it is a loud bar so this is possible.\n\nLoud pubs and bars is always going to be crowded affairs, with people squishing and squeezing past you.

Always set boundaries.", "NTA but I'm guessing it would have creeped you out more if he'd leaned in close to shout in your ear.

You just never, ever ask, but if you do *definitely* take no for an answer. \n\nA lot of people see a woman not drinking at a holiday party and think it's somehow appropriate to ask her amongst other people/the public whether she's pregnant. If she didn't announce it, it's not for you to know! It's not your business! She could have any number of reasons for not drinking, including drug interactions or issues with migraines or alcohol-induced headaches, or maybe she just found out and it's \"too early\" to announce it! I can't imagine being practically forced to announce a pregnancy to everyone you know and then a couple weeks later tell them all you had a miscarriage or the test was wrong (rare but possible). Too many people think other people's health is their business. \n\nOnce, I had someone come up to me in the ladies restroom at work to ask if a coworker was pregnant again. Her kid was probably less than 2 at the time. Like, it was possible, but if so it would have been *very* early, and IMO it was clearly a little pregnancy weight hanging on (didn't even make her overweight) which I wouldn't judge to begin with. (I breastfed, and any attempt to lose weight while doing it drastically reduced my supply. Not to mention I had to take in like an extra 900 calories to keep my weight steady and keep producing in the first place. But also, you're tired and stressed and probably not eating right regardless of formula or breastfeeding, all of which is completely understandable and common. But I digress.) I was offended on my coworker's behalf but also glad she asked me instead of the coworker. \n\nThere's a Nigerian midwife in the UK I love to follow. As she so perfectly summed up: \"Are those your breasts? Is that your vagina? No? THEN MIND YA BUSINESS.\"", "Welcome to the constant harassment the vast majority of the female population faces (and that is globally, in a general sense).\n\n And that is just the tip of the iceberg. Most of us have been dealing with this sort of bull since we were 12, in some cases. But we're supposed to just grin and bear it because we're ungrateful or overreacting. Harassment is not a form of complimenting anyone. I don't think anyone would like to be catcalled by a creep who can be as old as one of your uncles or grandparents, much less have them invade your personal space or make unwanted advances at you. \n\nDepending on the country, there will be a certain degree of harassment rooted in sexism, and it will show itself in different ways. There are instances where you can't even wear skirts if you're taking the underground/metro because there's a risk of upskirting and even spreading it online, if not to the extreme point countries like Korea will go to at times, but in the UK there's also been such crimes too and only very recently people started taking it more seriously a bit. But most times, if someone says something, the victims are seen as attention-seeking, deemed as liars because they're \"overreacting,\" or guilt tripped and victim-shamed because \"how dare you wear those clothes\". The issue is not on the clothes, I've been catcalled while wearing 3 layers of clothes in a cold winter morning while on my way to a tesco supermarket, right out of bed. \n\nSimilarly, I'd only assume that for those men who go through some level of violence too (especially if LGBTQIA+, for example) at the hands of other men (and/or abusive women) will not be taken seriously either.

YTA, he wasn't being inappropriate he was trying to get you to move, not hit on you... Wtf.", "What's the chance he asked. You didn't hear. He talked. You didn't hear so said GTFO the way.", "YTA - you being a 22 year old woman dressed in goth clothing is not, indeed, needed context.", "Yta", "Lol give me a break OP", "Yes", "YTA\n\nYou are in a a crowed and I assume loud space. My guess is you were in a walk way and the guy was just trying to move past you. Stop making a big deal about something that isn\u2019t.", "NAH\n\nWe do this commonly in the bars I've been around, both men and women are generally handled this way. More often than not, its a chaotic scene and nobody knows their surroundings. So by grabbing a person, you are preventing them from abruptly turning around, possibly maybe knocking over a tray of drinks by accidentally moving into the path that you wanted to warn them from staying clear of. When growing up, we always tried the sensible way first, tapping on the shoulder or verbal communication. But after one too many broken pints of beer, you learn that its better to make sure there is no miscommunication.", "YTA. You sound so full of yourself and he was just trying to get by in a presumably somewhat busy bar. Would you rather him truck you over?\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I'm 22 F and have never felt weird about that unless someone is rubbing their groin on me while doing it. It was probably loud and he didn't mean any harm by it. But if it made you uncomfortable that's fine too. Just maybe be more aware if you're in a place that you're in the way?", "ESH. Sure he probably shouldn\u2019t do that, but it\u2019s not like he wouldn\u2019t let go or touched you other places. In a crowded bar, you\u2019re bound to bump into people. \n\nIMO you really didn\u2019t need to make a big deal out of nothing.", "Get over yourself Jesus christ. Life if going to be miserable if you get fired up over something so small. He didn't assault you and YTA for getting confrontational over something so stupid and meaningless", "I see the comments are turning the OP's words from \"touched\" to \"grabbed.\"  Nowhere does the OP say grabbed.  Nowhere.  In a loud, crowded bar, if I'm trying to get the bathroom, it's going to require some contact.  Probably with several people.  I'd rather touch them somewhere innocuous so they know I'm there than wind up inadvertently in a weird position.  Never have I ever thought about whether the person was wearing long vs short sleeve vs tank top and whether or not tapping their shoulder was occuring on fabric vs skin.  Never have I thought that goth clothing would have made a difference in how I needed to get past them to get to the bathroom.  I'm a 43 year old female, and I can tell you that in crowded, loud bars, my ARMS getting touched is not an issue compared to all the other real estate people have tried to put their hands on.  No one is an asshole here, but seriously, another confrontation over nothing.", "He had probably already asked you to move and done the arm thing to get your attention after his attempts. Because as you say it's a loud place", "Eish....I dunno I mean you're not an YTA but it's overreacting imo. cause it was a Bar, full and loud. What do you expect to happen if you stand in the way? You can't be sure he didn't try to get your attention before moving you. And it's normal to ignore some soft  touches when there's a lot of people. \n\nIn my country it's pretty normal to move someone (no matter the gender) in this way when it's important they move aside or they didn't react. And it helps to keep a distance between you so there's no misunderstanding.  Had it done to my a couple of time, just a short touch on both my arms and moving me gently aside. Ok sorry I was in the way, my bad.\nAnd I did it myself too. \n\nFrom your explanation i gather his touch didn't linger and he didn't try to pull you to him, which yeah that would have been inappropriate.  He just moved you. Done. Your comment honestly got an appropriate response. Would have said the same.", "Yta you literally said it's a loud bar after saying he needed to use his words. Maybe DNT go to a dive bar with expectations of never being touched in a packed bar lol", "ESH, a stranger touched you and you have a right to be upset with it, however he could have tried to ask you to move but you didn't hear it OR if you were standing in the middle of the walkway and maybe he waited for a bit for you to move but you didn't. So he in a way, may have needed to touch you to get your attention.", "It's hilarious to me that OP felt the need to mention she was 22 and dressed in alt/goth clothing. What possible relevance could her style of clothing have in this instance?\n\nI was going to say we need more information to determine who the asshole is in this situation, but bringing that up indicates to me YTA.", "NTA but he\u2019s NTA either. You\u2019re being a bit oversensitive and I don\u2019t think he did anything wrong. Like you said it was a loud bar, he might have asked you to move before touching you and you didn\u2019t hear him", "Yeah.  I don\u2019t see them doing it to a guy.  So it\u2019s not ok for me either", "Absolutely. The double arm grab is a display of power. It's creepy... it's far too intimate of a touch from a stranger", "it\u2019s fair to say that he may have been simply trying to get past her, but imo jumping straight to the double arm grab (as a man doing this to a young woman, in particular) at the very least smacks of a lack of self or situational awareness. i\u2019m a woman and in my experience there are plenty of men who wouldn\u2019t pull shit like that (or would at least be self-aware about it) bc they get that it just comes off different. in a perfect world it wouldn\u2019t, but that\u2019s not where we live.\n\n& even assuming he hasn\u2019t gotten negative reactions doing the same in the past (which is a big assumption imo) the fact that he got defensive about it when confronted throws me. if you do something you believe is genuinely benign and it makes someone else *that* uncomfortable, why wouldn\u2019t your reaction be instantly apologetic instead of defensive and hostile? that could just be me, but it\u2019s confusing tbh.", "Exactly! If someone touches one of my arms I automatically turn sideways while taking a step back but if both of my arms are touched I step or scrunch myself forward so they can scoot around me from behind. I got tired of getting a foot stepped on!", "I think it was so we know she has a complex \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 sort of sarcasm but not really", "100% self centered behavior. Like how dare you tap my arm?! Ridiculous", "A loud bar does not suddenly make you deaf. They were literally using their words in the story. How did this comment get upvoted so much? That's over 1150 people who read the OP and failed to recognise that these people successfully exchanged words. What you also don't get is that it's reasonable to not want strangers to handle your body, I guess you haven't had the misfortune to have strangers touch and grab you for no reason when you don't want them to, but it's pretty simple expectation that people should keep their hands to themselves and not a first world problem at all, it's part of a broad attitude by which assaults are perpetrated. Please think more carefully?", "I agree. Life gets a lot rougher than an arm tap. This is a ridiculous post.", "Exactly on the preventing a back up maneuver.", "Exactly. Imagine expecting a bar to have elbow room and whispering.\n\nOP is the AH, and I think this generation sexualizes every damn thing. \n\nOh look, there's a rip in a furry pillow.  Some guy will probably have a go in it. /s", "I agree. The guy was trying to pass, not cop a feel. You can\u2019t even tap someone on the arm that\u2019s crazy.", "You can tell OP is one of those people who gets all territorial about their space at crowded bars and plants their feet on the ground when others try to navigate past", "My friend has long hair and looks feminine from the back because of it.  He's talked about how many men grab him by his waist when trying to move around him, only to be genuinely horrified when he turns with the full beard and mustache.\n\nIt's sexism.  Full out, it's believing that they have the right to touch you because you present as female to them.  Next time jab your elbow into them when they grab you, and be \"so sorry\" at your \"startle response\", because why they ever touch someone without asking.", "I do the double shoulder lay but that's because I don't wanna be punched lol. I live in a military town and I touch the back of the shoulders so that way I don't get nailed cuz of the defense training military get. I'm a woman tho.", "I almost added that to my comment of NTA. He wouldn't have put his hands on both of a man's arms, he might touch his shoulder with his finger to a man, but has to get all touchy only on women", "The only time I've seen it happen to other men is if they're disabled and using a mobile aid which reinforces it is a power move and treating others like an object.", "God could you imagine the comments then", "It's not the touching that's the issue, it's the holding her with both of his hands and moving her before trying to simply touch her to get her attention and indicate she's in his way.", "Ugh, I worked in fast food for a few years after graduating high school, and there was this old pervy guy that I despised waiting on. Always called me \"such a sweet girl\" like five times an order, approached me if I was out in the lobby so he could stand really close, stuff like that. Keep in mind that I was like 18/19 at the time, but people always thought I was no older than 16, and this guy was at least in his 60s.\n\nOne day, he showed up while I was ordering my food during my lunch break, so I was on the customer side of the counter. Heard somebody walk in, figured they'd stop where the line always starts and didn't bother turning toward them as i paid for my food. Then I suddenly felt somebody's entire hand on my lower back, and this guy was just inches away from me. \n\nEven just thinking about that day makes me nauseous.", "Hold then. He used both his hands to hold her body by the arms and move her. When your contact involves moving another person, it's not simply a touch.", "Best answer.", "honestly would lose my mind in such a situation or spill my drink on them", " u/cgrrg  Where I'm from \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf2 The only time a man takes his left hand and places it on a person's left arm, while taking his right hand and places it on a person's right arm, IS WHEN IT'S A WOMAN HE'S TOUCHING! If a Man was in front of him, He wouldn't have touched both his arms! He would have tapped his shoulder! Seen it a million times", "I was hoping to see someone who realized that in a crowded DIVE bar this is normal and not some kind of horrible offense.", "If he would\u2019ve gently squeezed her bare shoulder you know she\u2019d be equally offended. \n\nGranted I just read one of her comments that she said shoulders. She\u2019s said arms in other places. \n\nI don\u2019t really know. A few things don\u2019t add up.", "common? sure. appropriate? no.\n\nIt's also \"common\" for strange men to touch women on their hips or lower backs to move past them. That's not appropriate either.", "Given how many folks have gross family members, I wouldn't say it's okay there anymore either.", "He can die mad.\n\nI had hyper emesis while trying to work full time. Which means I was vomiting all day every day from about 4 weeks on until delivery.\n\nI worked closely with a woman who totally knew what was going on and did the civil thing of making sure I had water and keeping her mouth shut. When I announced I was pregnant she congratulated me joyfully.", "That\u2019s a pretty fair way to look at it lol", "I usually only touch a stranger (man or woman) with the back of my hand on their upper arm or shoulder of which way I'm coming from.\n\nIf it's super tight I'll pass with my arms out a little bit so that they touch the back of my hand with their lower back before they bump into me with their butt.\n\nI always say \"Let me squeeze by real quick.\" Followed with \"Thank you ma'am/sir.\"\n\nAnything besides minimal touching of a stranger like that should 100% be called out.", "Alcohol keeps my court-ordered anti-psychotic from working. The judge said after the last time that I definitely would be facing prison time if I drank again. I don\u2019t know why he got so pissy, I only stabbed the dude/woman 10 times for asking me personal questions. Sheesh, the justice system in US is so messed up. What was your question again?"]}
