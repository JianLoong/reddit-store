The proper way is to use your words first and then if that does not work you can tap them on the shoulder? Touching both arms in an attempt to move them is unnecessary and excessive.", "I think this is a move every guy over 50 does when they are trying to move passed someone. I am a 25 year old guy, and I was out at a restaurant with friends, and a guy who was about late 50\u2019s put his hands on my shoulders, and said, \u201cgonna sneak by ya, buddy\u201d.

These are some REAL first world problems", "YTA\n1: Your clothing doesn't matter, so wtf?\n\n2: You sound like you think you're the main character.\n\nIf you were a guy, you would have just been pushed to the side for being an asshole for standing in the way as if the world revolves around you.\n\nWhat are you sick of? People not accepting your entitled arrogant bullshit?", "I don't think there is enough info here. I mean, is it possible he asked you and you didn't hear him? No person should be touched if the intent is to violate space or dignity but in a crowded or loud area there are also other variables", "NAH. You should be aware of your surroundings if you don\u2019t want to be touched in a crowded place where someone might be trying to get by you.\n\nNo, he shouldn\u2019t have touched you but if you don\u2019t want to be touched at all don\u2019t stand where people are walking.\n\nWhy did you mention how you were dressed?

Yes he shouldn't have touched you, but it seems like it was truly harmless to get you out of the way. And you have every right to ask him not to touch you, but by saying \"please don't touch me\" it seems like you made it weird by making it seem like it was more than to just move out of the way. Your age and clothing imo have nothing to do with what happened. Now if you say he was staring at you for a while, or he touched you more than once. Okay, I'd be fully on your side, but at least me personally I don't think it was to cause you harm or discomfort. His response to you was a bit rude, but it was because your \"please don't touch me\" made him feel like he was a pervert or something.", "YTA - Don\u2019t be so precious, you\u2019re not that special.", "YTA get a grip", "YTA - You were in a shared area and blocked a space that people pass through.

I'm not sure why your choice of clothing matters in you being impolite in public and that's what swayed me. It feels like you added that piece of needless information in as a \"ew he touched you\" distraction from the fact you were rude.\n\nEdit - instant downvote, seems like OP doesn't want our opinions unless they agree with her own.", "First off touching someone\u2019s arms is not the same as grabbing someone\u2019s arms. My husband and I were out at our favorite dive bar tonight and I had several different men and women touch my arms from behind while shouting  out excuse me! so I could step FORWARD out of their way. I have done the same to people myself. Crowded bars are often loud and people don\u2019t pay attention to a stranger talking to them even if they are saying excuse me. The reason why I touch both arms is because it lets them know I am directly behind them so they don\u2019t turn and step back into to me which has happened numerous times in the past. If it bothers you that much don\u2019t stand around a crowded bar or find a seat and stay there. I\u2019d rather have someone touch my arm to let me know they want to pass by than push through me.", "NAH\n\nShit like this happens all the time in crowded bars. As a man I've had this happen tons of times. People are tipsy, drunk or high and aren't as subtle as they usually are. You are probably the 80th person who 'got in the way' that night.\n\nThis is not a power move, this has nothing to do with gender. This is actually 10 times better than the assholes who just bump you and push through.", "I don\u2019t know if YTA, but your reaction strikes me as super obnoxious and unnecessarily aggressive.  I don\u2019t know why he touched both of your arms but if it was a very loud bar I would expect that he would have either had to yell loudly and/or at least tap you on the shoulder to get you to move.", "Touching someones arm while moving past them is normal. Its so that person knows your there and they dont bump into you. I assume it was crowded, so him touching both arms is so he can squeeze past you while making sure you dont fall over. Its just being polite.", "Yes. You're in a crowded bar, expect to be either moved or used as stability for older people. Double yes because this person's intent wasn't to actually interact with you in any way, but rather just to get past you.\n\nYou just wanted to assert your personal space over someone else after being pointed out as in the way. It was a egocentric move and your request for affirmation here is just more of the same.", "YTA this is a basic human interaction for a loud bar. Grow up", "I suffer from the same thing you do\u2026.the, \u201c I\u2019m oblivious to everyone else and stand where I feel like\u201d thing. You are the AH. You said it was loud. You said you were in the way. Maybe he had said something several times but you couldn\u2019t hear or ignored him. Maybe he had been drinking all night and couldn\u2019t hold his urine, as old people do.", "YTA. Loud bar, you likely weren\u2019t responding to more polite gestures. The double arm grab being equated to sexual harassment is such a Reddit take. Get some real problems. \n\nSource: I am a 25 year old woman.", "In New York if you\u2019re in the way you shall be moved. I think it\u2019s polite he said something", "YTA\n\nWhat dont you understand on the concept of non-verbal communication through touch, in very loud and noisy environment, where the easiest form on getting simply things like \"please move a bit ouf othe the way\" across is just simply by touching the person on a neutral spot.\n\nYou sound like the typcial 22yo these days. Big Yikes. Youngsters like you piss me off to no end :)", "YTA. He didnt gropped you.", "YATA!!!\n\nGet OVER your self. Loud bar. Go stand in the corner or sit down  or do not go to busy places if you do not want to be moved out of the way which is normal behavior. I bet it was your type of person it would be different right. The \"older\" gentleman part here is the operative word.", "YTA. Stop making mountains out of molehills. \n\nAs a woman I will continue to place a hand on people\u2019s back as I squeeze past them in noisy environments because it\u2019s the polite thing to do. Just barging past is far ruder.", "I don't like being touched by strangers so I don't go to places where I might be touched by strangers. \n\nIf it's a loud bar and he can't make you hear him then what choice does he have?\n\nYTA", "NTA. I work at a bar and understand well that people won't hear me while i walk around cleaning, restocking, etc. I often start by asking them to let me through. If they dont hear me, I ask louder or give them a tap on the shoulder. But for the most parts I just find a gap and slide through. Grabbing with both arms is super uncomfortable  and, like others, have mentioned a power move.", "YTA. It sounds like you\u2019re purposely positioning yourself in a crowded club, so you can stand in the way and complain when someone touches you, so you can get attention and a feeling of empowerment. Then to feel even more empowered, you make it a big deal and post about it on Reddit. The guy even said \u201cexcuse me\u201d for Christ\u2019s sake. You\u2019re obviously not telling the story as it really played out.", "people replying have never been to a pub the correct way is to wip it out to show dominance.", "Tbh I'd say YTA as that's the way I and many other people get others to move when in a crowded place. Nothing is meant by it.", "If he just moved you, nothing else, then YTA. He wasn't being creepy, it's more like he was pissed. Maybe it was because of you, or maybe he was pissed before; there's no way to know. But if he just moved you, touching you only for the time needed to pass, you overreacted.", "NTA and what are these comments. Don't go to loud bars if you don't want a dude to touch you without your consent? Do you think men regularly rub other men's arms, touch their lower backs, or physically move them out of the way when they can't pass? \n\nPeople (probably guys) commenting don't get it. It's gross and creepy for strange men to touch you all the time.\n\nOP, you are always justified in asking anyone not to touch you. And if you somehow didn't hear him, he should have spoken up or tapped you on the shoulder briefly, not rubbed/grabbed your bare arms.", "YTA. You\u2019re in a crowded bar. And this \u201cdon\u2019t touch me\u201d crap is out of control. Touching is not violence or assault. You were rude and entitled. What happens when you choke on something and nobody helps because \u201cdon\u2019t touch me\u201d has scared everyone off? Instead of being an entitled brat, how about making a joke about it to get your point across? \u201cHey, normally you would have to buy me a drink first before that happens.\u201d  And smile. He would still realize maybe it was too far for YOU, but you weren\u2019t an entitled brat who stood in the way. This attitude nowadays of expecting everyone to know YOUR boundaries instantly, is sooo self indulgent. And then being just plain rude about it. Do you know what rude is? It\u2019s a way for a weak person to pretend to be stronger. And it doesn\u2019t work. Grow up.", "I'm split on this one. If he had already tried to get your attention and you didn't notice, then yes, YTA for being oblivious and being in the way. If he just grabbed your arms first, then NTA.", "YTA, loud bar, what would you rather have him do? Scream as loud as he can for you to move? Have you ever been to a loud bar before? People tap you on the arm/shoulder all the time if it's crowded and they want to move past you, that is the polite thing to do.", "Let's see... did he do it more than once? Did he hold on to you, never wanting to actually to past you? Did he try to make conversation with you? \n\nIf all the dude wanted was to get past you then YTA. It's a loud bar, you wouldn't have heard a fuck behind you and no one has spidey-senses to feel when someone is behind them so touching is quite a normal reflex to do when trying to get someone's attention \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nTo those in the comments saying its some sort of power move or whatever... do you ever realise the way you unconsciously touch someone you want to move?

Am I hitting on them then when I already have a boyfriend? \n\nAnd I don't do any difference between guy and girl. If I need to move, I'm not gonna stand there like a statue until you finally realise someone's calling out to you...

You are too self conscious.", "NTA\n\nWhile I understand that sometimes in a loud/crowded environment it's hard to be heard, you have a right to not be touched without your consent.  Even had he tapped your shoulder to get your attention, that would be (IMO) preferred to grabbing both your arms.", "NTA at all. I know others have said that perhaps he tried to ask you to move and you didn't hear him, but even if that's true his next move should have been to tap your shoulder, not GRAB BOTH YOUR BARE ARMS. Unacceptable on his part.", "YTA. This is being blown insanely out of proportion. I have both touched and been touched by people of both genders in exactly the way you described to clear an obstructed path. Its a very common gesture that implies \"hey you're in my way, here's me communicating that clearly, while ensuring I don't shove you out of the way\"", "YTA. In crowded places there is always contact. If you don't like that, don't go.", "NTA - I am personally so uncomfortable with being touched even by people I know so this is a big Nono for me. \n\nA similar situation happened to my coworker where she stepped back and didn\u2019t realise a man fixing something was there and he legit touched her waist and she looked at him and just went \u201cdo *not* touch me.\u201d And he tried to use the excuse that she stepped backwards but there\u2019s ways to avoid touching women if you really want to.", "Yta don\u2019t stand in the way then and it\u2019s not like he assaulted you and the next time they should just push you away", "YTA, most likely.    Depends on a few things.   1) were you in the middle of the pathway?   2). You said it was a noisy bar, are you sure that he didn\u2019t ask you to move and you just didn\u2019t hear him and therefore could have appeared to be ignoring his request for you to move?  3) Did you apologize for being in their way?", "YTA", "YTA! He's right.

Don't go to dive bars if small interactions like this bother you.\n\nIt's small, it's cramped, you are lucky if you have more than 10cm space around you free. So you standing in the way like a dum dum and then getting pissy about someone moving you makes you the arsehole.\n\nYour age is irrelevant, you chose your own clothes. \n\nEnd of it is you were being inconsiderate by standing in the way.

Have you ever in your life seen any man do this to another man?", "That is a little too touchy. If someone needs to get a strangers attention in a loud crowded environment, a shoulder tap is appropriate. No need to go both hands on, and your response was appropriate.

People are going to move past you and may touch you accidentally or on purpose to get past you. \n\nI think you\u2019re reading into this too much. If he had touched you somewhere inappropriate then fair enough but it\u2019s seems innocent and like a guy trying to just get through a crowd.", "NTA and I do not understand other comments here.

Double arm is just creepy", "NTA. Don't fucking touch strangers folks.", "Yta. Thats common in bars and he wasnt doing or saying anything inappropriate. People calling it a power move are reading too deep", "Oh man, get over it. You completely overreacted to it. You\u2019re taking that emo sh*t too seriously.", "NTA - I hate it when people do this, just say excuse me or tap your shoulder if it was loud.

You did mention that it is a loud bar so this is possible.\n\nLoud pubs and bars is always going to be crowded affairs, with people squishing and squeezing past you.

Always set boundaries.", "NTA but I'm guessing it would have creeped you out more if he'd leaned in close to shout in your ear.

There is no reason to be touching them like, and it\u2019s not appropriate or okay. Just tap them on the shoulder. You don\u2019t get to say \u201cwell it\u2019s crowded in here so it\u2019s fine for me to touch whoever I want even if they aren\u2019t okay with it\u201d", "Sounds like you need to stop touching people without consent like a creep", "Yeah, blame the person who is just simply existing instead of the men grabbing said person without permission.", "But there is something wrong with a strange man grabbing or touching  both arms.

Even more so, and I think this point is missed by a lot of y-t-as in this post, but the stranger was not entitled to the space she was already occupying.\n\nSomeone can ask you to move out of their own way, but you don't actually have to change your position. In fact, OP could've flatly refused to move for whatever reason and the man would STILL not be within his rights to touch or move her. He has no more right to that spot than she had.\n\nShe was in a public, shared space, blah blah blah. Sounds like she was sat at or sidled up to a bar, a place a person is allowed to occupy for minutes on end. She was talking to the people she was with. She was behaving in all socially acceptable ways for the venue and was not in the wrong for where she was standing (e.g. blocking a doorway, being in the path of accessing a bathroom).\n\nAnd yet, this man decided to access the bar through her.

So is that what is being understood here implicitly that I'm not understanding?\n\nBecause if it isn't and he touched \"either\" side, it's possible he had to tap her more than once to get her attention.\n\n\nOP is an unreliable narrator, and the word either is *either* being used incorrectly, or she's lying.", "A poke is one or two fingers, not all 4. It's a tap, but not a \"tap tap\" with only two fingers and a shorter touch period.", "Yeah and lots of others saying the opposite too.\n\nIt's almost as if something being ok with one person doesn't make it ok for another and everyone has a right to set boundaries to their own body.", "You're right, I assumed he pushed her, because when people have done this to me to get me to move, they did actually push a bit. It's possible that he just put his hands on her and leaned in to say, \"excuse me\" before letting go and waiting for her to move.", "It's kind of a common move in loud situations.

I found it uncomfortable the first time someone did it to me.", "Yes that will get peoples attention. I worked in a bar/beer garden since I was 15 and I never had to grab someone to get their attention.

If you just want someone to move, you cannot touch them like that. Just ask them to move, if they don\u2019t hear you, tap them. It\u2019s not that hard.

Would it be okay if he used his foot to gently nudge her out of the way? What about his butt?
