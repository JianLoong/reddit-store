You wrote all reasons why you were wrong and still didn't get it lol", "YTA - I was a Diamond on Delta for many years.  Had similar situation on an international where I was upgraded but my spouse and child were not (was a free upgrade for me).  I talked to my wife beforehand, and we agreed to split the time so we each got around 4 hours sleep and had our daughter for the rest.  If I were your spouse I'd have been pissed more at the fact that you stuck her with the kids while you lounged than the fact your seat was more comfortable.  It doesnt sound like you were thoughtful, nor did you try and find a way to even things out after she made it known she was pissed - bad call.", "YTA - If you can't afford to put your whole family in first class, you can't afford to fly first class.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it was a bargain, you left your wife to deal with the kids on what was by your own description a long, overnight flight.\n\nAnd you didn't even discuss it with her beforehand. \n\nI'm just curious as to what about this you thought wasn't, at best, extremely thoughtless? This has to be rage bait, right?\n\nNoone can possibly exist who doesn't see the problem with this?", "YTA - on what planet is it acceptable for one spouse to take the ultimate comfort experience and leave the other in the sardine can with all the kids?? You should have refused the upgrade on principle or given the seat to your spouse as you were making the decision alone. Maybe switch out half way through the flight if you want to make it somewhat even. I really hope you enjoyed the seat because that's the most comfortable bed you're going to be in for a while.", "YTA.

Your poor wife. You PAID MONEY to contribute to their misery. Biggest AH of all time.", "YTA you didn\u2019t even offer to switch seats with her for part of the flight? You just left her to fend for herself on an overnight flight with 3 kids. You better have some good ideas on how to make this up to her.", "YTA they are your kids to seem you knew the hustle it Would be  to take care of the children during the flight, so you bailed out on her it had nothing to do with prices or saving", "She's absolutely right. You left her alone with 3 young children so you could have a comfy flight. That's selfish and irresponsible, both as a husband and as a father. You showed your wife she can't trust you to stick by her, you showed your children it's okay to ignore your loved ones' needs as long as you get what you want, and you showed the entire world that you really don't think about anyone but yourself. I really don't know how to fix this one. It's not just the flight; it's that you didn't even consider the impact of your choices on other people. You have a huge amount of self-reflection to do and hard work to get to the point of being able to see and care about others' needs. Hopefully you're up for it; if not, hopefully your wife and kids can see what a jerk you really are and leave. YTA.", "Obviously YTA. But hey, you had a good flight experience, right?", "YTA, what you did was disrespectful and she is likely thinking this was a passive-aggressive message. If you actually want to stay married, you need to apologize for being an idiot.", "If you have to write a post asking if YTA for this, I can only imagine the selfishness you display in other areas of your marriage. \n\nIt probably would never cross your mind to switch so that you could take care of all 3 children on the flight for half the time. I have to wonder if you even know what it would be like to take care of all 3 of your own children at one time. \n\nIf my husband was comfortable treating me so selfishly, it would honestly make me rethink the entire relationship.", "YTA \n\nThis is one of the most selfish moves you could have made. You ought to have given her the upgrade after stepping in it so hard. Unending apologies are needed here.", "YTA this reminds me of that James Corden story about him ignoring the crying child next to him which seems fair at first, until it becomes apparent for everybody else that the crying child is his own.", "Good lord. Yes, of course YTA. If you had an ounce of sense, you would have given your wife the seat and sat with the children. As it stands, you'll be lucky if she doesn't divorce you. I certainly would.", "You upgraded yourself to first class and left your wife to deal with THREE CHILDREN, one an infant, alone. YTA to the point where other AHs are cringing.", "WOW! You left your wife alone with 3 little kids in economy on an overnight while you lived it up in first? And did it without consulting with her first? YTA. And this is so bad I have a hard time believing it\u2019s real.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nHope she makes you sleep on the couch douchehead", "YTA - for fucks sake, you\u2019re selfish. Just ditched her in a heartbeat to make your flight better and hers worse.", "You didn't just leave her in economy. You left her to deal with your three kids on her own. YTA.", "Especially since the infant was more than likely required to be held, so either dad and infant or mom and infant should have been in first class. YTA", "Clear case of being TAH and being oblivious. \nCould you have upgraded your wife\u2019s ticket? That would have made you a good partner. \nPaying money, even $150 down from $500 ON TOP of an already purchased ticket that gets you where you are going OVER NIGHT seems silly.", "There is just no way you didn't think about your wife through any of that. During travel you should be consulting each other especially with kids if anything comes up that changes the original plan. Also, if you care about the points and rewards, you should be min-maxing it for your family not just yourself. YTA", "INFO: When you were dropped on your head as a child, was it, like multiple little drops or just one big \u201cfell off the top of the refrigerator\u201d thing?", "You are unequivocally absolutely TA in this situation", "YTA is not strong enough for how badly you screwed up.  What a horrible, selfish thing to do.  You left your wife, with 3 small children, to manage on her own. Crammed into economy.  On a long overnight flight. So you could take advantage of all the comforts of first class alone.  You should have split the flight with her so that she could rest too.  I suggest you apologize profusely,  admit how wrong you were.  And buy her a first class seat for trip home while you juggle all 3 kids alone in economy.", "Dude, you owe your wife a first class experience on the flight back home, whatever the cost, with you wrangling the three kids by yourself in economy.  And even that might not fix what you've done.  \n\nYes, you are the AH.  The disrespect shown to the woman you supposedly love is staggering.  Good job ruining the vacation.", "YTA\n\nShe's right. You need a serious talk. You are a selfish person and you are an AH that you seem to forget easily that you have a family.", "Absolutely YTA.  You dumped your wife with three kids under 10 (including one not even a year old!) while you got to relax.  Ouch.", "You are a massive asshole. YTA big time. \n\nYou abandoned your wife to look after the kids on an overnight flight, while you had a jolly old time in first class living the highlife.\n\nDid you think about your family for even a moment before making the decision?", "Yes. YTA you left your wife in steerage on an overnight flight with three children under ten? That you don\u2019t seem to realize how incredibly selfish this is leads me to believe you pull crap like this all the time.\n\nI will be surprised if you are still married when the vacation is over and I hope she gets all your frequent flyer miles in the divorce settlement,", "YTA - Did you even think about offering the ticket to your wife?  My husband and I do this frequently because I have a loyalty and get upgraded for free (usually with a companion) on most domestic flights unless they are very full.  So we make a deal before flying - If we get upgraded on the way I will do it (with one kid) and if we get upgraded on the way back, I'll give the seat to him (and the other kid).  The airline doesn't care who sits in the seat.", "YTA. You abandoned your family just to get a nicer plane seat than them - how do you even think you can be in the right? \n\nYou have a family. Treat yourselves equally, or don\u2019t do it at all.", "Yta. I hope this was just lapse in judgment and your not always this selfish but it\u2019s most likely not. You better be thinking of way to make it up to her and beg for forgiveness because divorcing you is most likely crossing her mind.", "Here's the deal: you want a real good chance to get laid on your trip? Take the upgrade, give it to your wife, and deal with the kiddies in economy. \n\nWant to maybe get laid? Refuse the upgrade and travel with the fam in economy.\n\nWant to definitely NOT get laid? Take the upgrade for yourself.\n\nYour choice, sport.", "YTA. Why is this a question", "YTA! Are you fucking kidding me? I hope this post is fake. No way anyone could be that big of an AH to pay to upgrade and abandon their partner with 3 kids on a plane. One of whom is a FREAKING INFANT! I find it very hard to believe there wasn\u2019t a single economy seat available for you to sit in - or at least swap out with your wife for periods of time. You are unbelievable", "Yta hugely!  You left your wife to deal with three kuds while you swanned off to first class! I hope she ditches you for a day to go to a spa while *you* deal 100% with the kids.", "Why didn\u2019t you give the seat to her or at least split the time in the seat with her? You could have done shifts. So YTA for not sharing.", "Yta, you should have tried to give your wife the first class seat while you handled the kids. That\u2019s really crummy to spend money for yourself and make it harder on your wife. Just overall it was very selfish.", "YTA. How on earth did you not consider what the effect of what you did would have on your wife? I'm guessing you do very little childcare, and aren't home a lot and just assumed your wife would be totally peachy keen to mind all of your children on an overnight flight with no help from you. Ugh. I hope you get her a first class seat on the way back while YOU watch all of the children.", "You\u2019re the AH. Big time. You didn\u2019t think about it before hand but after you could have. If you couldn\u2019t switch it you could have given your first class seat to someone else near your wife\u2019s aisle so you could be with your family.", "YTA. You left your wife to deal with three kids by herself for a very long flight while you got to sit comfy in first class. Did you expect another answer?", "Wow! You\u2019re a selfish, self-centred asshole. I hope your vacation is awful. You brought this upon yourself.", "YTA", "YTA you were on a family vacation and left your wife in economy with three children. You have gotten into the dog house and you're never going to come out. \n\nThe only way to take that lovely upgrade would have been to give it to your wife and take care of the kids yourself.", "YTA, she\u2019s rightfully unhappy, you never paused to even think about your family and fellow travelling companions, selfish.", "This can\u2019t be real. But if it is, YTA", "YTA, you know what my husband would have done? Bought the ticket and given it to me. You left your wife with an infant and two other children. Ugh! That\u2019s just gross.", "YTA and the fact you need to ask here just up the AH factor a million times over.\n\nYTA YTA YTA", "YTA, you left your wife and 3 young kids on a plane while you went off to sit in luxury.\n\nI don\u2019t know what part of your brain thought you deserved this luxury while your wife tried to maintain the kids, are you just thoughtless, or massively arrogant? You say it\u2019s a better flying experience, FOR YOU, a vastly worse one for her.\n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d be hopping on the apology train headed straight towards kiss-ass town. Maybe use some of your flashy points to give her the first class experience on the way back, and you can slum it with the peasants, which is definitely the attitude you gave off.", "YTA. And you had to ask??!", "YTA 1000000% to the max. You left your wife alone with two kids under ten and an infant OVERNIGHT? You could not be more of an ass", "YTA\n\nWhy do you even have to ask Reddit? If you can't see what you did was incredibly wrong, then your relationship is in way more trouble than you think.", "YTA.\n\nEven at that point, you could have at very least taken the baby to lighten her load a little. That you didn\u2019t shows that your real intent was to escape from them all and leave her holding the bag.", "Yta! Dude what kind of man are you?? Embarrassing!!! Shameful.", "YTA for abandoning your wife with kids by herself on a long flight. You owe her a massive apology and first class ticket for the ride home. This is the kind of thing that can be the straw that broke the camel's back. I seriously wonder if you treat her with this type of disregard frequently.", "Lol.  How could you be that clueless?\n\nI think you have some major damage control to do....and it may involve an upgrade for your wife on the return flight.", "I would say YTA, because you left your wife with three kids. That is a lot to handle and it is unfair you left her with that responsibility.", "Huge YTA, you went from 1.5 kids each, to you get a good night's sleep and she gets 3 kids to look after alone... you didn't even ask her first smh", "YTA\u2026I\u2019m not gonna bother to explain what dozens of people have already done.", "Ya, you are. It's your family.", "YTA I love love love being upgraded. But it\u2019s not ok for you to fly in luxury whilst your wife is stuck in a tiny chair with three kids to watch alone. Save the upgrades for your solo trips.", "That must\u2019ve been horrendous for your wife wow. You are the major AH", "YTA I have to believe this was written by the wife bc no normal human could write this while thinking they aren\u2019t wrong.", "YTA because you had to ask", "This is a joke right? You aren\u2019t so ignorant that you thought it would be OK for you to fly first class while you left your wife alone with 3 kids under 10 one being an infant on a long overnight flight? If you really did this I hope you enjoy your vacation it will probably be your last one as a family.", "YTA. I also have high standing with an airline. On the way home from an out of country vacation, I got called to the gate to be upgraded to first class. When they confirmed there was only one seat available, I politely declined because I wasn't about to let Mr. WineAndDogs2020 sit solo in economy. You left your wife to deal with THREE kids while you enjoyed a much better flight experience. What a selfish prick you are.", "Remember it\u2019s not just your wife, but your children are watching as well.\n\nAs the father of a 6 year old girl, the way I treat my wife should model for my daughter how her husband or wife should one day treat her.", "This has to be fake because no one can be this dumb \n\nYTA just for typing \u201cserious discussion\u201d", "Wow.. YTA majorly.", "Man you are such an A that other A's look at you and think 'Man, what an A'.\nI get the impression your wife does most of the child care so what was wrong with you giving her the upgrade to get a little break while you corral the 3 kids?\nNot manly enough for you?", "OP didn't even think about the kids! It was only the wife who mentioned them, OP went through the whole upgrade process without a thought for how it was affect his partner. OP probably didn't even intend to help the wife while they sat right next to them.\n\nYTA", "YTA\u2026Holy crap man\u2026this is bad. You should have surprised your wife with it and taken care of the kids. You bailed on them. This is going to sting for the rest of your life.", "YTA.. why not upgrade everyone's tickets?  If that wasn't possible, then sit with your family.  How would you feel if she upgraded her ticket for the \" better experience\" and you had to stay in the back with the kids?  Why did you not offer her the ticket?  Are you that much more special and entitled than her and the kids?  You were wrong on so many levels.", "You forgot the part where you gave her the first class sent and took over for the kids to make up for it. Yta", "Obv YTA.\n\nThe reasonable solution on seeing your wife would have been 'you can share an airline seat with an infant' without buying the infant a seat.\n\nYou and infant ride in 1st, wife and older kids in economy.", "\"Hey honey, I hope you don't mind, but I'd really like to be more comfortable and not have to deal with screaming kids (including our own).

Meet you at the luggage area!\"\n\nYTA.", "YTA - If I were your wife, I'd be traveling on my own upgraded plane ride home, immediately, while you spent some quality time parenting our children. \n\nYour attitude upon your arrival home would be my determining factor on whether or not I was filing for divorce. \n\nGood luck, OP. Might I suggest groveling?", "Yta. You\u2019re the worst. Shame on you. How about on the way back you upgrade again and let her go up there and you watch all three kids alone. You\u2019re a terrible husband and father. You should be embarrassed .", "YTA. You are not traveling alone! You have your family. Ditching your wife to look after the kids alone is really an AH move.", "YTA.

At this point you should be thankful that parts of your anatomy is still intact. WOW So you start off your family vacation failing as a husband and father.

YTA", "YTA. Oh my gosh! You left your wife alone with an infant and two other kids, while you're being served champagne up front. ON AN OVERNIGHT FLIGHT! What the hell is wrong with you?", "YTA. You grabbed a first-class seat for yourself with no thought of your wife and kids on what\u2019s supposed to be a family vacation. Telling her AFTER was truly asshole behavior. \n\nAnd then, when it couldn\u2019t be undone, you proceeded to use it for yourself anyway. Did it not even cross your mind that you could have given the seat to her? Or take turns using it?\n\nYou left her to take care of 3 kids (including an infant!) on an overnight flight (!) by herself while you had a comfortable, quiet, stress-free flight. Was there any shred of guilt involved here, or were you able to just forget about them & enjoy it?  Wife is correct. You do need a serious discussion. Your  sense of entitlement and lack of remorse is appalling.", "Yta and and inconsiderate ass. \nHope you have your begging pants on instead of you vacation pants", "People are just posting Seinfeld episode plots now.", "You are so definitely that asshole. You selfishly left your wife to deal with your kids while on vacation. Consider yourself lucky if all you get is a verbal scalding and a cold shoulder the rest of the trip.\n\nTo make amends, you need to offer to take the kids completely offer her hands for as much of the vacation as she wants. If you don't do that, expect that your relationship is going to be badly damaged as a result.\n\nYes, I'm saying you're that self centered and entitled that you've got a lot of digging to do in getting out of the hole you made for yourself.", "Monumental YTA. I mean, really, WTAF???", "YTA you left your wife to look after all 3 kids on her own for the sake of seeking your own comfort. Only way to get out of this is to do the reverse on the way back and pay for her to fly first class and you look after all the kids. Oh and give her a night off in a hotel while you look after the kids once you\u2019re home - you screwed up now make it up to her!!!", "YTA. You left your wife with three kids while you enjoyed first class. You could have at least offered her your seat for a portion of the flight if it was that long. Even then, it is messed up that you thought it would be okay. Even if it was a free upgrade (I've gotten them before) you should have stuck with your family. A good start to fix it would be getting your wife an upgrade (alone) on the way home.", "YTA wtf is wrong with you. You\u2019re supposed to be a parent. Start acting like one. You can\u2019t abandon your family to hang out in first class overnight.", "YTA.\n\nWow.\n\nWTF.\n\nOf course you're the AH.  Seriously just abandoning your wife to manage three kids a lone while you live it up in First Class?  Like how are you not a giant AH.\n\nChrist.", "Should've checked with them if you could get a raincheck on the offer instead of taking it up right away", "YTA and you know you are. Why would anyone selfishly leave their spouse with three kids under 10 by herself in coach because he got a good deal - but only for himself - in first class? You need to pop for something special that quite literally gives her time to herself - like a SPA DAY - while you take care of the kids yourself. You\u2019ll be lucky if she doesn\u2019t divorce you.", "You left your wife with your 3 kids alone on a flight to sit separately in first class and you\u2019re honestly asking who\u2019s the ahole?! YTA", "YTA. You were on a family vacation. That's when you spend time with your family, not be selfish. You abandoned your wife to look after all three kids without even considering how it would make her feel.", "YTA \n\nAnd I know you like to put yourself first but it\u2019s My wife, kids, and I are on vacation.", "Do you left your wife to care for 3 kids on an overnight flight?? Wtf is wrong w you?? YTA all day all night forever- just next level narcissist", "Yta,  3 kids under 10 by herself,  I\u2019d tell you to take the next flight home", "YTA but at least **you** were able to travel in comfort. It's not like anything or anyone else matters to you.", "YTA. You are abandoning your wife to care for the kids while you kick back your seat and you don\u2019t even care you have made her life harder and she doesn\u2019t even get the company of an adult for a long flight. You should have declined this offer. I notice you didn\u2019t even mention how old the kids are. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s because it would make you look even worse than you already do. Even if it were just the two of you you\u2019d be the AH for leaving her alone. You\u2019re supposed to want to spend time with your wife", "You can just say you have zero respect for your wife as a person.", "YTA", "You\u2019re about the biggest YTA I can imagine for this. This was a seriously selfish and thoughtless decision, and I hope for your sake it was a complete aberration compared to how you usually behave because if not, your wife has plenty of reasons to be done with your shit.", "ooooooh you\u2019re in so much shit my guy. you selfishly upgraded yourself and left your wife to wrangle 3 kids *including a baby* on an overnight flight. and i\u2019m guessing the reason you have so many loyalty points is that you travel for work, meaning you leave her as the sole parent a lot. this seems like such a small thing but let me tell you, it really illustrates how little you care for her or the kids comfort. prepare for a rough conversation. yta", "YTA. It\u2019s a bit wild that 1) you didn\u2019t even talk to your wife about it 2) you should have offered to the infant and held them since you were in such a comfortable spot.", "You\u2019re a very selfish AH. You didn\u2019t even think about your family when you got that ticket. I hope your wife realizes that with a husband like you, she\u2019s on her own.", "YTA: You left your wife to parent to your two children alone when she expected you to be there to parent them as well. This is peak selfishness. I hope she rips you a new one, you deserve it.", "Not that big of a deal, relax", "I would seriously consider divorce over this. Peak selfish inconsiderate behavior.\n\nShould have discussed with wife before purchasing the upgrade in the first place. As a couple, they could have decided whether the upgrade was \u201ctoo good to pass up\u201d or not worth splitting up the family since someone had to mind the children at all times.\n\nIt was still a salvageable situation even after the upgrade couldn\u2019t be undone. OP could have offered wife the first class seat as a gesture of goodwill to make up for his poor judgement. Or split the flight time in half and take turns minding the children.\n\nI can\u2019t believe OP proceeded to sit in FC the entire overnight flight.", "That's not how it works. It's in the name of the person who is called up and can't be switched.", "Misogyny.", "This was my first thought \u2014 but probably his last. NTA", "I did ask if she wanted but she declined. Possibly to prove point though.", "Yes I had her in the hours when people weren\u2019t sleeping.", " OP probably has gold or silver status acting like he's a Medallion\nmember , and bragging about being offered a chance to BUY an upgrade at a discount. Lol\n\nI wouldnt take a free upgrade without my wife even if it was from economy to economy plus.", "My guess is OP is a tier one member ( what you get for having their credit card)  , humble bragging about having \"status\" . \n\nHe doesn't have enough points to upgrade himself, he had to pay for it.", "Nah it\u2019s pretty bad. He PAID to abandon her with three kids. Terrible move for a husband and father. That\u2019s an incredibly selfish thing to do, especially without talking to her first.", "Unfortunately the airline isn't necessarily going to allow the wife in first class.  But done is done and husband is TA.", "I've sat in first class a few times and they would not allow sharing the seat with another person.", "You seem like the typical Reddit user that lives on AITA. Unhappy and miserable that divorce is your first thought, OP is the AH but suggesting divorce shows how sad you are. \n\nHave you spoken to a therapist about your issues instead of taking it out on Reddit?\n\nEdit: please down vote this more, show me how sad and miserable all you losers on AITA are! Only a miserable sole would suggest destroying a family over a simple selfish mistake that can be sorted. \ud83d\ude06", "It must depend on the airline. My husband travels all the time for work, so he gets upgraded regularly. He has let me and his assistant use his upgrades in the past.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine why they would care about the name anyway. I was once on a flight where a pilot was given a spare seat in first class. I gave up my economy aisle seat so a woman could sit with her husband. When the pilot realized what I\u2019d done, he gave me his first class seat and he took the middle seat in a row of three.", "I was upgraded before because of points. I boarded with my husband and took his seat and he took my upgrade. He totally could have given his wife the seat or split the time at the good seat.", "Did you honestly think of doing that before you realized she was upset? You didn\u2019t relay in your post that you offered that as a solution.", "Or she knows that you couldn\u2019t handle the kinds by yourself.", "Yeah I feel like this is a lie. You would have included this in the initial post if true to make your side sound better but the fact you seem clueless that she was mad gives the indication you didn\u2019t even think of it.", "Why just in the hours when people weren\u2019t sleeping? Why does mom get the crap seat, the other kids, and the baby during sleeping hours? People in coach don\u2019t like to be bothered by a baby any more than people in first class do.", "Your still an ass for separating from your family", "Now you\u2019re twisting it as if he had malicious intentions. Selfish for sure though. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f he\u2019d have to take care of the kids for the majority of the vacation to pay for that imo.", "True. My partner and I shared an upgrade once and no one cared. But you\u2019re right, every airline has different policies and they\u2019re probably enforced at the discretion of the individual flight crew.", "Lol I\u2019m very happy in my 10+ year relationship, partly because neither I nor my partner have ever done anything this selfish and inconsiderate toward each other, but thanks for your concern.", "Ruin a whole family over a dumb selfish mistake... lol", "This is it \u2026 she already knows she can\u2019t count on him to handle the children and she wouldn\u2019t be able to actually relax", "I didn\u2019t say he had malicious intentions. This man clearly just doesn\u2019t think for two seconds before he does something. Just because he may not have had malicious intentions does not change the fact that he did something that hurt his wife.", "That is AITA for you\u2026 Lol. OP could simply send the wife away on a weekend by herself to relax and he takes care of the kids. \n\nBut no miserable Redditors solution is to divorce and make children suffer because that makes a lot more sense."]}
