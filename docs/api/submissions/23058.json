He took your rejection of his nieces personally and it's sort of bled over into the wedding planning. I'm sure he's had so much to deal with due to his ex's SA and the kids are so young. \n\nI would try to have a heart-to-heart with your brother over this. Forget the wedding for a second -- it sounds like you have some repairing to do of that bond. Call your brother and just pour your heart out about how you're feeling. The pain you felt seeing his nieces in a fragile time, and how you feel badly that while you LOVE them all so much it's made it doubly painful for you.\n\nYou are well within your rights to have a \"no kids\" policy, but I think the way this was handled will lead to an unfortunate and irrevocable rift if you don't try to reestablish a relationship with your brother.

We get it we get it, child free weddings are very in. But the fact of the matter is if you do not include loved ones in your important life moments, they won\u2019t want to include you in theirs. It puts into perspective how important a person is when destination or child free weddings are used to cull the invite heard. I\u2019ve had to decline two family weddings because of the no kids rule, and it changed my relationship with those family members. Not bitter, but facts is facts.\n\nAnd if you even took the time to talk to your brother, you may have learned that he could not afford to come to your wedding without bringing his daughters since all of his family babysitters would presumably be at your wedding, and he\u2019s a single dad raising the girls on his own. Maybe if that was his big issue you could have found and paid for a babysitter for him. But no, his problems are not your problems, oh wait, until they are because now your parents aren\u2019t going to your wedding. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you are going through infertility issues, truly, I\u2019ve been there myself, but it does not give you the right to do whatever you want and not face consequences to your actions.

The fact that their mom seems to be the only true AH here is irrelevant but also - stable healthy role models are important for kids and it seems like up to now you have (graciously and lovingly) played a role like this for your nieces. \n\nTotally fine to not want kids in the wedding. But to me, as a mom to 2 living children as well as having gone through both a  miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy, I feel like you are projecting your hurt on your nieces and brother and not only does that not seem fair, it also doesn\u2019t seem like it has a positive end result.", "YTA.

You asked for space and he gave you the space. He was always there for you. But now that it's wedding day, it seems this relationship doesn't matter to you anymore.

You're allowed to not want kids at your wedding.

Lots of people don\u2019t want kids at their wedding for reasons far less devastating than yours.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to do this but remind your parents and brother that while you love your nieces and they are of course blameless in this, right now being around children is painful.

However, the message you're sending to your neices is that you don't want them in your life anymore. I understand how hard it is to be around little kids when you're struggling yourself. I've been dealing with infertility for almost six years. The thing is, your neices don't understand that. They just know their beloved aunt is avoiding them and they miss you. Kids blame themselves when adults leave their lives. You need to seek therapy and work on being able to handle having them in your life again or you won't have much family left.", "It's your wedding so NTA but your rules are going to come back at you. Miscarriages can have and do have a big effect on you clearly and you need therapy for that. It's probably affected how your communicating. Of course your brother will stop visiting, he's a single parent and can't leave his kids by themselves yet as they're not old enough. Also again to not have them even attend the wedding your brother will ultimately put his kids first. Not like he can leave them with thier mother in the shape you've described. Can't leave with your parents because then they can't come. So however it goes, rock and a hard place is what this seems to be. Therapy is a must even group therapy because a therapist will probably put how your feeling better than you'll be able to, or at least more rationally so they understand. Then they can explain how you made them feel so you understand.", "NTA\n\nGrieving your miscarriage by asking to be away from literal toddlers, a step above babies, is reasonable. Your brother was acting like a right fool to be offended by that.\n\nYou were grieving and need time away from toddlers and babies. They may be your niblings, but they are toddlers and a physical representation of what you lost.\n\nNo kids at the wedding because you planned to get lit and party is also reasonable. Why are people calling you the AH because you needed time to grieve and making a no kids wedding?", "NTA for the wedding, you decided no kids months ago. But you're def being an AH with the way you're communicating.\n\nI've had three miscarriages, so I get it. However, it's been five months since your miscarriage and since your nieces have seen you and now, they're not invited to the wedding. While you had made the no kids rule before any of this, it's quite probable that cutting them off has hurt them and will cause irreparable damage. They most likely won't view it as two separate things, but one large FU to them. You're now someone they know will abandon them if need be. So just think about the repercussions of your actions, because it may end up that when you've decided they're allowed to see you again, they'll want nothing to do with you. \n\nAre you in therapy?

I understand. Sending hugs!!!", "I've seen the comments, I'll give more information. Me and brother are \"close\" because our parents didn't care about me, they cared for him but not me. I used to hate him for that, but came to realize he cared for me and did anything he could for me, we bonded because of that. My parents were very neglectful towards me and caused me to be I would say depressed. My brother was there for all of it, very grateful for that. Once he and I graduated went to college we didn't keep in touch that often, maybe when we were both at the same family gathering. I met my soon to be husband, introduced him to my family. He went along to finding his first wife and baby mother, they were perfect such a cute couple, they then gave birth to my two adorable nieces. Then after some personal issues (not going to put all her business out due to respect) baby mother started substance abusing and my brother couldn't handle it around the girls, he put her out. That was tough for him, I gave him my support and stayed with him for a while. After that me and my fiance started getting serious, (we have been dating for 3 years) and he proposed in early october of 2022. I told my family about my engagement, it was all cheer and giggles. In late december of 2022 I had finally got back a positive pregnancy test after maybe a yesr of trying, me and my fiance couldn't have been happier. We told immediate family as we were going to wait until the second trimester to tell my family. That's when during my doctors appointment in early february we learned our baby no longer had a heart beat. We planned to tell our family that following sunday. Me and my fiance were broken, it was hard for us the baby we wanted to have so bad was gone. My brother was there to support me and my nieces, when they did visit I was gentle with my nieces and still tried my best to be a good aunt even though they didn't understand what was happening. After their second visit i couldnt handle seeing them anymore, I texted my brother and told him, without wanting to upset him or the girls. He took it personally, saying I knew how much time he spends with his daughters and im jealous, i want this to be about me knowing I have to see random babies in public (parents took his side.) I was frustrated and confused, I tried to somewhat explain myself but that didn't work. I eventually started to feel better and reconnected with my brother partically, and try to be there for my nieces as much as i can (he did not want me at their birthday parties, i sent gifts to them regardless) Then i told him i wanted him to be a groomsman in my wedding as he os very important in my life, we started talking and discussing the wedding. The topic of no kids was mentioned, he was okay with it then. As it got closer to the wedding he started pushing the idea of my nieces as the flower girls, I tried to gently shut that idea down multiple times. The day he received our invitation, we were already discussing wedding colors and cake flavors (my oldest niece said we have to have a chocolate and vanilla cake, we took that suggestion our wedding cake is a chocolate and vanilla swirl.) He then started pushing again for my nieces to be flower girls, i then had enough and told him that if he insisted they come then he cannot come to my wedding. Yes i blocked him and that was harsh, he has been unblocked for around a week (we havent texted since.) Another thing i would like to clarify, I dont want kids because of the crying and running around, drinking adults and the location and time of the wedding (the time of the wedding is almost every kids bedtime and its in a country club.) Yes its local so nothing far out of town. I'd say i can allow 13+ only because they are more mature and definitely been to other weddings, or they can stay home and babysit little brother/sister (parents choice.) Finding babysitters isn't an issue, I've also written on invitation if they cannot pay for a babysitter (low income) I wouldn't mind paying, i recommended groups of cousins being babysitted. I feel like my brother is just being ignorant, but after reading comments I think i should tell him how i feel. Thank you.", "NTA.  People have child free weddings all the time.

Ghosting children that you are close to for months, who have already lost their mother and have to deal with all the attachment issues that come from that, is not a reasonable thing to do.

When I lost my mother I didn't expect the rest of the world to hide their mothers from me. When I had a miscarriage I didn't expect other people's pregnancies and children to be hidden from me, and nor did my friends or sister expect me to hide my daughter when they experienced their own miscarriages.
