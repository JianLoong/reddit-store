He took your rejection of his nieces personally and it's sort of bled over into the wedding planning. I'm sure he's had so much to deal with due to his ex's SA and the kids are so young. \n\nI would try to have a heart-to-heart with your brother over this. Forget the wedding for a second -- it sounds like you have some repairing to do of that bond. Call your brother and just pour your heart out about how you're feeling. The pain you felt seeing his nieces in a fragile time, and how you feel badly that while you LOVE them all so much it's made it doubly painful for you.\n\nYou are well within your rights to have a \"no kids\" policy, but I think the way this was handled will lead to an unfortunate and irrevocable rift if you don't try to reestablish a relationship with your brother.

We get it we get it, child free weddings are very in. But the fact of the matter is if you do not include loved ones in your important life moments, they won\u2019t want to include you in theirs. It puts into perspective how important a person is when destination or child free weddings are used to cull the invite heard. I\u2019ve had to decline two family weddings because of the no kids rule, and it changed my relationship with those family members. Not bitter, but facts is facts.\n\nAnd if you even took the time to talk to your brother, you may have learned that he could not afford to come to your wedding without bringing his daughters since all of his family babysitters would presumably be at your wedding, and he\u2019s a single dad raising the girls on his own. Maybe if that was his big issue you could have found and paid for a babysitter for him. But no, his problems are not your problems, oh wait, until they are because now your parents aren\u2019t going to your wedding. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you are going through infertility issues, truly, I\u2019ve been there myself, but it does not give you the right to do whatever you want and not face consequences to your actions.

The fact that their mom seems to be the only true AH here is irrelevant but also - stable healthy role models are important for kids and it seems like up to now you have (graciously and lovingly) played a role like this for your nieces. \n\nTotally fine to not want kids in the wedding. But to me, as a mom to 2 living children as well as having gone through both a  miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy, I feel like you are projecting your hurt on your nieces and brother and not only does that not seem fair, it also doesn\u2019t seem like it has a positive end result.", "YTA.

You're allowed to not want kids at your wedding.

Lots of people don\u2019t want kids at their wedding for reasons far less devastating than yours.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to do this but remind your parents and brother that while you love your nieces and they are of course blameless in this, right now being around children is painful.

However, the message you're sending to your neices is that you don't want them in your life anymore. I understand how hard it is to be around little kids when you're struggling yourself. I've been dealing with infertility for almost six years. The thing is, your neices don't understand that. They just know their beloved aunt is avoiding them and they miss you. Kids blame themselves when adults leave their lives. You need to seek therapy and work on being able to handle having them in your life again or you won't have much family left.", "It's your wedding so NTA but your rules are going to come back at you. Miscarriages can have and do have a big effect on you clearly and you need therapy for that. It's probably affected how your communicating. Of course your brother will stop visiting, he's a single parent and can't leave his kids by themselves yet as they're not old enough. Also again to not have them even attend the wedding your brother will ultimately put his kids first. Not like he can leave them with thier mother in the shape you've described. Can't leave with your parents because then they can't come. So however it goes, rock and a hard place is what this seems to be. Therapy is a must even group therapy because a therapist will probably put how your feeling better than you'll be able to, or at least more rationally so they understand. Then they can explain how you made them feel so you understand.", "NTA\n\nGrieving your miscarriage by asking to be away from literal toddlers, a step above babies, is reasonable. Your brother was acting like a right fool to be offended by that.\n\nYou were grieving and need time away from toddlers and babies. They may be your niblings, but they are toddlers and a physical representation of what you lost.\n\nNo kids at the wedding because you planned to get lit and party is also reasonable. Why are people calling you the AH because you needed time to grieve and making a no kids wedding?", "NTA for the wedding, you decided no kids months ago. But you're def being an AH with the way you're communicating.\n\nI've had three miscarriages, so I get it. However, it's been five months since your miscarriage and since your nieces have seen you and now, they're not invited to the wedding. While you had made the no kids rule before any of this, it's quite probable that cutting them off has hurt them and will cause irreparable damage. They most likely won't view it as two separate things, but one large FU to them. You're now someone they know will abandon them if need be. So just think about the repercussions of your actions, because it may end up that when you've decided they're allowed to see you again, they'll want nothing to do with you. \n\nAre you in therapy?

Plus, you could easily imagine the brother feeling hyper-protective of his kids (and extra-sensitive to slights against them, perceived or otherwise), especially since he's their sole protector. It sounds like he has an \"us against the world\" mentality...", "He's well within his rights to not want to go to the wedding", "They arnt going to thr wedding", "Uh\u2026.lots of things are happening at weddings kids do not need to be around.  Ask anyone who works weddings, kids are often the source of so many tears and damages or neglected because the open bar is lit.", "Enough videos of kids ruining weddings would show why it is a bad idea. Not every event needs kids.", "Wait why is the brother not an AH for repeatedly trying to push his daughters as flower girls \u2014 especially one that is  2 years old", "Wth man you're seriously calling a woman who had a very hard miscarriage an asshole for not wanting young kids around for a while??\n\nCan't believe I'm getting downvoted when this dude is in the comments insulting someone for being \"weak\" for having a miscarriage...", "This isn't \"Am I Right\" it's \"Am I the Asshole?\"", "At least they don't have a relationship anymore", "He did say no", "Why would she lie about loving the nieces?", "You're a massive AH with zero idea about what it's like to feel life grow in your body, then die.", "youre asking for distance from literal children. who op said she is close to and love and love her back. \n\ncan you imagine how horrible it must be for them that this consistent loving presence stop for months on end for no reason?\n\nwhat would have op done if she already had children?", "Not having her family there is going to be painful to. There isn\u2019t a magic way to not feel pain, she\u2019s trading one type for another, and the one she\u2019s trading for hurts others", "LOL keep repeating it it will be true.", "Sure, and  guess once the OP has a child her neices will be welcome around again.  Its not just the wedding it is that she has cut them out of her life for months and it sounds like the rest of the family is done with her also.", "She didn't want her nieces around, her brother respected that and you're blaming him? That's odd.", "yup there so close though.i cant imagine the brothers feelings doesnt want to see kids cuz she will be sad at the sight come on 2 kids being there while they are and i quote \"we did not want any kids at our wedding because we were going to be drinking, partying,\"  im fine with no kids but dont lie", "I said what I said.", "and what would she have done if she already had children?\n\ncan you imagine how her nieces must feel?", "lol they didnt want kids there because they want to drink and party f that its in the post i cant imagine being \"close\" to my brother and saying that and then blocking him lol hope the parents dont go they chose a side hope your wedding fantastic though lol!!!", "I feel bad for her but seriously she needs therapy and lots of it.", "Only because they want it to. There are PLENTY of child free weddings. It is very standard now a days. The brother is choosing to be offended by it.", "It\u2019s only been a few months. Having a child DIE and then asking for a few months to heal is ENTIRELY reasonable. It has been five months since her child died. Whether it was still inside her or not it was her child.", "Ya I guess she figured he would leave them and just go well guessed wrong.", "agree they didnt want kids there because they want to party and drink its in the post", "Omg God forbid someone wants to party on their fucking wedding day!! How dare she!!", "Yes a miscarriage and losing a child is hard.  I lost my daughter age 23 a few months ago.  I have nieces and nephews aged 1 year to 25 and I see them and don\u2019t push them away.  Even when I want to I remember that you need your family when things are tough.  One is getting married and I will be there to celebrate even though I know there will be hurt knowing that will never happen for my daughter. What if op had other children would she have pushed them away too, her nieces already lost their mother to drugs and now are pushed away again.  The brother is being pushy too since he can\u2019t expect them to be flowergirls. A wedding is not worth losing your family. It\u2019s one day, cherish your family because there are not any guarantees for tomorrow.  A lesson I learned all too hard.", "Disagree. A miscarriage is absolutely a loss and can be devastating. But it is not the same as having an actual living, breathing, child with a life and personality die.\n\nOver 1/3 of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Plenty of people don't even know about them when they happen. That is very different from a child you are raising dying.", "nope but dont lie.He comforts his sister and is always there for her and she does this fuck that.He is a single parent and she says if you cant be away from your kids (2/3yos)for a few hours dont come,so he isnt and she just seems upset the parents are on his side.", "And that is how YOU handled your grief. Not everyone is the same. Some people cling to family and others need time and space.", "It doesn\u2019t feel very different to her right now I can assure you. She has never had a child to feel the difference.", "Well that whole paragraph didn't make any sense\ud83d\ude02"]}
