And you do want them around you.

He took your rejection of his nieces personally and it's sort of bled over into the wedding planning. I'm sure he's had so much to deal with due to his ex's SA and the kids are so young. \n\nI would try to have a heart-to-heart with your brother over this. Forget the wedding for a second -- it sounds like you have some repairing to do of that bond. Call your brother and just pour your heart out about how you're feeling. The pain you felt seeing his nieces in a fragile time, and how you feel badly that while you LOVE them all so much it's made it doubly painful for you.\n\nYou are well within your rights to have a \"no kids\" policy, but I think the way this was handled will lead to an unfortunate and irrevocable rift if you don't try to reestablish a relationship with your brother.

We get it we get it, child free weddings are very in. But the fact of the matter is if you do not include loved ones in your important life moments, they won\u2019t want to include you in theirs. It puts into perspective how important a person is when destination or child free weddings are used to cull the invite heard. I\u2019ve had to decline two family weddings because of the no kids rule, and it changed my relationship with those family members. Not bitter, but facts is facts.\n\nAnd if you even took the time to talk to your brother, you may have learned that he could not afford to come to your wedding without bringing his daughters since all of his family babysitters would presumably be at your wedding, and he\u2019s a single dad raising the girls on his own. Maybe if that was his big issue you could have found and paid for a babysitter for him. But no, his problems are not your problems, oh wait, until they are because now your parents aren\u2019t going to your wedding. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you are going through infertility issues, truly, I\u2019ve been there myself, but it does not give you the right to do whatever you want and not face consequences to your actions.

The fact that their mom seems to be the only true AH here is irrelevant but also - stable healthy role models are important for kids and it seems like up to now you have (graciously and lovingly) played a role like this for your nieces. \n\nTotally fine to not want kids in the wedding. But to me, as a mom to 2 living children as well as having gone through both a  miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy, I feel like you are projecting your hurt on your nieces and brother and not only does that not seem fair, it also doesn\u2019t seem like it has a positive end result.", "YTA.

You asked for space and he gave you the space. He was always there for you. But now that it's wedding day, it seems this relationship doesn't matter to you anymore.

You're allowed to not want kids at your wedding.

Lots of people don\u2019t want kids at their wedding for reasons far less devastating than yours.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to do this but remind your parents and brother that while you love your nieces and they are of course blameless in this, right now being around children is painful.

However, the message you're sending to your neices is that you don't want them in your life anymore. I understand how hard it is to be around little kids when you're struggling yourself. I've been dealing with infertility for almost six years. The thing is, your neices don't understand that. They just know their beloved aunt is avoiding them and they miss you. Kids blame themselves when adults leave their lives. You need to seek therapy and work on being able to handle having them in your life again or you won't have much family left.", "It's your wedding so NTA but your rules are going to come back at you. Miscarriages can have and do have a big effect on you clearly and you need therapy for that. It's probably affected how your communicating. Of course your brother will stop visiting, he's a single parent and can't leave his kids by themselves yet as they're not old enough. Also again to not have them even attend the wedding your brother will ultimately put his kids first. Not like he can leave them with thier mother in the shape you've described. Can't leave with your parents because then they can't come. So however it goes, rock and a hard place is what this seems to be. Therapy is a must even group therapy because a therapist will probably put how your feeling better than you'll be able to, or at least more rationally so they understand. Then they can explain how you made them feel so you understand.", "NTA\n\nGrieving your miscarriage by asking to be away from literal toddlers, a step above babies, is reasonable. Your brother was acting like a right fool to be offended by that.\n\nYou were grieving and need time away from toddlers and babies. They may be your niblings, but they are toddlers and a physical representation of what you lost.\n\nNo kids at the wedding because you planned to get lit and party is also reasonable. Why are people calling you the AH because you needed time to grieve and making a no kids wedding?", "NTA for the wedding, you decided no kids months ago. But you're def being an AH with the way you're communicating.\n\nI've had three miscarriages, so I get it. However, it's been five months since your miscarriage and since your nieces have seen you and now, they're not invited to the wedding. While you had made the no kids rule before any of this, it's quite probable that cutting them off has hurt them and will cause irreparable damage. They most likely won't view it as two separate things, but one large FU to them. You're now someone they know will abandon them if need be. So just think about the repercussions of your actions, because it may end up that when you've decided they're allowed to see you again, they'll want nothing to do with you. \n\nAre you in therapy?

I understand. Sending hugs!!!", "I've seen the comments, I'll give more information. Me and brother are \"close\" because our parents didn't care about me, they cared for him but not me. I used to hate him for that, but came to realize he cared for me and did anything he could for me, we bonded because of that. My parents were very neglectful towards me and caused me to be I would say depressed. My brother was there for all of it, very grateful for that. Once he and I graduated went to college we didn't keep in touch that often, maybe when we were both at the same family gathering. I met my soon to be husband, introduced him to my family. He went along to finding his first wife and baby mother, they were perfect such a cute couple, they then gave birth to my two adorable nieces. Then after some personal issues (not going to put all her business out due to respect) baby mother started substance abusing and my brother couldn't handle it around the girls, he put her out. That was tough for him, I gave him my support and stayed with him for a while. After that me and my fiance started getting serious, (we have been dating for 3 years) and he proposed in early october of 2022. I told my family about my engagement, it was all cheer and giggles. In late december of 2022 I had finally got back a positive pregnancy test after maybe a yesr of trying, me and my fiance couldn't have been happier. We told immediate family as we were going to wait until the second trimester to tell my family. That's when during my doctors appointment in early february we learned our baby no longer had a heart beat. We planned to tell our family that following sunday. Me and my fiance were broken, it was hard for us the baby we wanted to have so bad was gone. My brother was there to support me and my nieces, when they did visit I was gentle with my nieces and still tried my best to be a good aunt even though they didn't understand what was happening. After their second visit i couldnt handle seeing them anymore, I texted my brother and told him, without wanting to upset him or the girls. He took it personally, saying I knew how much time he spends with his daughters and im jealous, i want this to be about me knowing I have to see random babies in public (parents took his side.) I was frustrated and confused, I tried to somewhat explain myself but that didn't work. I eventually started to feel better and reconnected with my brother partically, and try to be there for my nieces as much as i can (he did not want me at their birthday parties, i sent gifts to them regardless) Then i told him i wanted him to be a groomsman in my wedding as he os very important in my life, we started talking and discussing the wedding. The topic of no kids was mentioned, he was okay with it then. As it got closer to the wedding he started pushing the idea of my nieces as the flower girls, I tried to gently shut that idea down multiple times. The day he received our invitation, we were already discussing wedding colors and cake flavors (my oldest niece said we have to have a chocolate and vanilla cake, we took that suggestion our wedding cake is a chocolate and vanilla swirl.) He then started pushing again for my nieces to be flower girls, i then had enough and told him that if he insisted they come then he cannot come to my wedding. Yes i blocked him and that was harsh, he has been unblocked for around a week (we havent texted since.) Another thing i would like to clarify, I dont want kids because of the crying and running around, drinking adults and the location and time of the wedding (the time of the wedding is almost every kids bedtime and its in a country club.) Yes its local so nothing far out of town. I'd say i can allow 13+ only because they are more mature and definitely been to other weddings, or they can stay home and babysit little brother/sister (parents choice.) Finding babysitters isn't an issue, I've also written on invitation if they cannot pay for a babysitter (low income) I wouldn't mind paying, i recommended groups of cousins being babysitted. I feel like my brother is just being ignorant, but after reading comments I think i should tell him how i feel. Thank you.", "NTA.  People have child free weddings all the time.

Having gone through quite a few myself I can understand her pain. Having said that yes she could have explained better WHY she didn't want to see the littles though her brother should have been more sympathetic instead of convincing their parents that she was in the wrong instead of destroying her inner circle. Everyone needs an inner circle. But you should never, EVER, destroy someone else's because you can't understand the pain. As well as you shouldn't be another reason as to why women need to advocate for their rights just to have feelings. Try to be more understanding although as part of the male species I'm sure that is quite hard for you.", "I can see that too, but if I had a close relationship with my sibling and they suddenly said something that I took as them hating my kids? I would probably be pissed for a while before cooling down and asking them what they meant. And that cooling down period would be a lot smaller if I realized they had just received life shattering news like a miscarriage.\n\nIts ok to misunderstand someone.

As I said, you can keep telling yourself whatever you like, but that doesn't make it correct. \n\nSome people absolutely need isolation from triggers. Some people need isolation from people in general. Others need support in various forms. \n\nTo have your sister explain that seeing children is traumatic for her, due to having just lost a child, and having her ask you to keep the kids away for a while, and then acting like an idiot and saying, \"If your own nieces cannot come, neither will I,\" is arguably one of the most heartless things I've read recently. \n\nYour insistence that your experiences are the norm seem equally heartless to me.", "What a ridiculous insult.

Along with their descriptions of their conversations, it seems indicative of a person who may be lacking some communication skills. Not everyone is in your head with you, so sometimes going a bit farther to be considerate of the feelings of others and communicating your own will go a long way with solving the family relationship problems OP has created for themselves.", "Agree 100% These kids are little and they\u2019ve gone through a loss, too.

You know what that\u2019s like? I DO. It\u2019s a *devastating* thing and without secure attachments? These kinds of ACES (adverse childhood experiences) can really mess up their ability to attach to anyone, *ever.* My extended family circling the wagons after my bio mom left is literally the only reason I\u2019m a halfway decent person today and not some completely cold-blooded husk. Maternal abandonment is *serious* shit. \n\nFrankly your brother needs to consider this and decide if he\u2019s going to allow your inconsistency in their lives. *More* perceived abandonment could really set them up for a lifetime of bad things, and they don\u2019t deserve that. \n\nI am sorry about your loss, but hey guess what? Your brother had a traumatic relationship ending, but he still wanted to see you happy in your relationship. You think he isn\u2019t gonna remember his ill-fated vows while you recite yours? That a part of him won\u2019t be hurting while being a part of your happy day? He was willing to do it though, wasn\u2019t he? Sounds like he made an effort to heal to me, but did it occur to you that giving the appearance of rejecting his kids could be very triggering to him? \n\nEveryone telling you to get help is right. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for wanting a child-free wedding necessarily, but *combined* with being MIA from those little babies\u2019 lives for nearly half a year? Not a good look, OP. YTA.

If your guests with kids will want to party they will have found childcare or send their kids home with grandma when she leaves the wedding, but if they would have brought their kids had you not excluded them they will likely be dipping as early as possible to get back to their kids. If you want to actually enjoy your family and friends who you want there celebrating you, it\u2019s usually best to just not have any big exclusions/expectations of your guests so they can make their own choices about how they can be there for your big day.

She's allowed to grieve her loss, it's perfectly normal and she shouldn't be shamed into getting over it sooner than she's ready.\n\nDo you know how long it took for my parents to legally adopt a child who ended up being me? Six years. It's a long and expensive process. It is worth it but it doesn't cancel out grief from miscarriage.", "Adoption is still entirely different then going through a pregnancy and having your OWN child.", "Because OP wasn\u2019t being entirely truthful in her reasoning for not wanting kids at the wedding.", "Same in Spain. This US childfree weddings baffle me to no end.", "Parents realized what kind of monster OP became and decided to GTFO.\n\nCan't say I blame them either.", "This is EXACTLY what it's all about for him.  His kids are his number 1 priority.  That makes him a good dad.  \n\nAs another poster said, OP sounds very abrupt, so it's coming across as she's pissed that her brother has kids after her miscarriage.   It could be a natural reaction, but she should seek counseling before she pushes her family away entirely", "Exactly. People without kids thinks that you just can leave it at home. They dont understand someone needs to be with them all the time. Also, the parents wants to take care oof the kids. Its never the same thing having a stranger taking care of them. So much can go wrong.", "She asked him to not bring her nieces for a while immediately after a miscarriage. She didn\u2019t \u201ccut\u201d anyone out. I definitely think there\u2019s more info being left out conveniently.", "Yeah. I wouldn't want to be around any of them. I'm tempted to say \" n a h \" cause they're both allowed to say, \"no kids, please\" and \"that doesn't work for me, bye.\" But both of them kind of really just suck in terms of be disrespectful jerks.", "Can't he call her? I get he may not be able to visit often but a phone call to his sister who he is close with would have been nice. But the whole wedding thing, I'm kid free and I don't wanna a big wedding, just elope but I doubt I would have a kid free wedding...maybe leaning towards hiring a daycare thing, I don't know what exactly it's called, so the kiddos are watched during the ceremony.", "Imo as soon as you hurt other people with your trauma you become the asshole. Brother was hurt that op essentially didn't want his family around anymore. Parents were also more than likely hurt too.\n\nAnd you can't keep children in a closet for years until OP is ready to be okay around children again.", "My god. Thank you. All of this.", "I apparently threw a fit for it. I do remember sipping it. Budweiser.", "Absolutely this! My niece is 3 now, and I don't see her as much as I want but I definitely think she mostly doesn't notice when I am not there. I have had 2 moment of my brother asking me to jump onto a video chat because she is demanding me, but thats only if I have visited within the past 2 weeks.", "Its just deliberately excluding one group of people. What would the consens be, if I made a female or male only wedding?! Would be pretty weird, right?!", ">it was not personal\n\nExcluding people is always personal. Those kids are people, not objects to be possessed or envious of. Excluding people simply for being is pretty much always an AH move.", "Also a 2 and 3 year old can be a lot to handle, sometimes grandparents aren't able to do it if they are older.  My in laws weren't comfortable watching my kids who are close together until they were a little older and able to do more things on their own.", "The kids mother isn\u2019t in their lives - he is their ONLY parent. Chances are, if they\u2019re not in school, he is with them. \n\nHe can\u2019t be in two places at once. If she wants him to be around her - she has to accept that he has kids for which he is the only caretaker. If she asks him to keep the kids away - it goes without saying that he can\u2019t come around either.", "She\u2019s grieving the loss of her pregnancy, not of her baby, and I am assuming an early miscarriage, so basically had a positive test and everything stopped a couple of weeks afterwards.", "That would be an ESH, not a NAH.", "Playdates for kids that young involve the parents staying there.", "Exactly. Weddings are family&friends parties, why exclude some group from that? And what are they going to do at the wedding that kids absolutely cannot witness? \n\nI think this is more about doing something that would look perfect in the pictures.", "Yup lol", "This.  I\u2019m so confused by the people saying NTA when the bother is a single parent to two young kids.  Not like two teens that could reasonably be left alone for a few hours.\n\nWe had to terminate due to medical reasons last year.  It\u2019s still hard to see kids because it feels like everywhere we go and look there are babies.  I also know two people who had kids basically right around when I would have been due.  I\u2019ve always inquired after them when I see them because frankly my loss and grief don\u2019t mean others need to diminish or hide their joy.\n\nIs the pain still there?  Yeah, but it hurts a little less every day, week, month.  And life goes on - there are kids everywhere and I can\u2019t expect there to be no kids.  Some days are better than others.\n\nI can certainly understand wanting a short reprieve from nieces, but I don\u2019t think I could shut them out completely for this long.  And I wouldn\u2019t blame my sibling for not being around for me when their own kids should really be their priority.\n\nSounds like OP needs therapy.  It just feels weirdly vindictive and targeted.", "\u201cThe Miscarriage was DEVASTATING\u201d\u2026at no point did OP say how far along in her pregnancy she was, coupled with Fertility Issues. Plus NO ONE can tell another How to Grieve THEIR Loss.", "I was 12 weeks pregnant when I miscarried. My sister was due the day after my due date. I just asked her to not talk too much about her pregnancy for a few weeks, but did not ask her to stay away, even if it felt like a gut punch to see her stomach sometimes. It took me a long time to get pregnant again, and I still wasn\u2019t when her baby was born. I still saw her and her baby when it was born.\n\nIt\u2019s fine not to want kids at your wedding, and it\u2019s fine not to spend time with small kids just after a miscarriage. It\u2019s not great to avoid your young nieces for 6 months.", "My aunt had a daughter who died as a baby after being her miracle baby and then was never able to have another child after that due to having had polio as a child and her husband's own fertility issues.\n\nShe's mentioned many times over the years how hard it was for her to be around myself and all of my cousins as well as other children and babies. However, at no point did she shut the family out and would regularly spend a lot extra time around us whilst we were growing up. She always said how it helped her to be more happy by being around children despite the pain of how she could never have a child of her own. \n\nAnd that pain never left her. A few years ago her husband passed away and she broke down and started to blame him for her not being able to have children and how she hated him for it.", "I'm so, so sorry for your loss.  I hope the grief continues to diminish", "He could have trust issues because of his ex.  The girls are pretty young, so he hasn't been alone with them that long.", "Grandparents, as in the mother and father of his sister (the bride) who might be \u201cbusy that day\u201d or the parents of the substance abusing mother?", "PTSD from a miscarriage?", "Not to mention rejection issues for himself but more so on behalf of his babies. His wife/their mom abandoned those children. As a parent, you feel that for your kids. Then his own sister rejects them too. He may be in the middle of healing as well. She doesn't seem to be aware of that."]}
