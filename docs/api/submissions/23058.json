He took your rejection of his nieces personally and it's sort of bled over into the wedding planning. I'm sure he's had so much to deal with due to his ex's SA and the kids are so young. \n\nI would try to have a heart-to-heart with your brother over this. Forget the wedding for a second -- it sounds like you have some repairing to do of that bond. Call your brother and just pour your heart out about how you're feeling. The pain you felt seeing his nieces in a fragile time, and how you feel badly that while you LOVE them all so much it's made it doubly painful for you.\n\nYou are well within your rights to have a \"no kids\" policy, but I think the way this was handled will lead to an unfortunate and irrevocable rift if you don't try to reestablish a relationship with your brother.

We get it we get it, child free weddings are very in. But the fact of the matter is if you do not include loved ones in your important life moments, they won\u2019t want to include you in theirs. It puts into perspective how important a person is when destination or child free weddings are used to cull the invite heard. I\u2019ve had to decline two family weddings because of the no kids rule, and it changed my relationship with those family members. Not bitter, but facts is facts.\n\nAnd if you even took the time to talk to your brother, you may have learned that he could not afford to come to your wedding without bringing his daughters since all of his family babysitters would presumably be at your wedding, and he\u2019s a single dad raising the girls on his own. Maybe if that was his big issue you could have found and paid for a babysitter for him. But no, his problems are not your problems, oh wait, until they are because now your parents aren\u2019t going to your wedding. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you are going through infertility issues, truly, I\u2019ve been there myself, but it does not give you the right to do whatever you want and not face consequences to your actions.

The fact that their mom seems to be the only true AH here is irrelevant but also - stable healthy role models are important for kids and it seems like up to now you have (graciously and lovingly) played a role like this for your nieces. \n\nTotally fine to not want kids in the wedding. But to me, as a mom to 2 living children as well as having gone through both a  miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy, I feel like you are projecting your hurt on your nieces and brother and not only does that not seem fair, it also doesn\u2019t seem like it has a positive end result.", "YTA.

You asked for space and he gave you the space. He was always there for you. But now that it's wedding day, it seems this relationship doesn't matter to you anymore.

You're allowed to not want kids at your wedding.

Lots of people don\u2019t want kids at their wedding for reasons far less devastating than yours.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to do this but remind your parents and brother that while you love your nieces and they are of course blameless in this, right now being around children is painful.

However, the message you're sending to your neices is that you don't want them in your life anymore. I understand how hard it is to be around little kids when you're struggling yourself. I've been dealing with infertility for almost six years. The thing is, your neices don't understand that. They just know their beloved aunt is avoiding them and they miss you. Kids blame themselves when adults leave their lives. You need to seek therapy and work on being able to handle having them in your life again or you won't have much family left.", "It's your wedding so NTA but your rules are going to come back at you. Miscarriages can have and do have a big effect on you clearly and you need therapy for that. It's probably affected how your communicating. Of course your brother will stop visiting, he's a single parent and can't leave his kids by themselves yet as they're not old enough. Also again to not have them even attend the wedding your brother will ultimately put his kids first. Not like he can leave them with thier mother in the shape you've described. Can't leave with your parents because then they can't come. So however it goes, rock and a hard place is what this seems to be. Therapy is a must even group therapy because a therapist will probably put how your feeling better than you'll be able to, or at least more rationally so they understand. Then they can explain how you made them feel so you understand.", "NTA\n\nGrieving your miscarriage by asking to be away from literal toddlers, a step above babies, is reasonable. Your brother was acting like a right fool to be offended by that.\n\nYou were grieving and need time away from toddlers and babies. They may be your niblings, but they are toddlers and a physical representation of what you lost.\n\nNo kids at the wedding because you planned to get lit and party is also reasonable. Why are people calling you the AH because you needed time to grieve and making a no kids wedding?", "NTA for the wedding, you decided no kids months ago. But you're def being an AH with the way you're communicating.\n\nI've had three miscarriages, so I get it. However, it's been five months since your miscarriage and since your nieces have seen you and now, they're not invited to the wedding. While you had made the no kids rule before any of this, it's quite probable that cutting them off has hurt them and will cause irreparable damage. They most likely won't view it as two separate things, but one large FU to them. You're now someone they know will abandon them if need be. So just think about the repercussions of your actions, because it may end up that when you've decided they're allowed to see you again, they'll want nothing to do with you. \n\nAre you in therapy?

I understand. Sending hugs!!!", "I've seen the comments, I'll give more information. Me and brother are \"close\" because our parents didn't care about me, they cared for him but not me. I used to hate him for that, but came to realize he cared for me and did anything he could for me, we bonded because of that. My parents were very neglectful towards me and caused me to be I would say depressed. My brother was there for all of it, very grateful for that. Once he and I graduated went to college we didn't keep in touch that often, maybe when we were both at the same family gathering. I met my soon to be husband, introduced him to my family. He went along to finding his first wife and baby mother, they were perfect such a cute couple, they then gave birth to my two adorable nieces. Then after some personal issues (not going to put all her business out due to respect) baby mother started substance abusing and my brother couldn't handle it around the girls, he put her out. That was tough for him, I gave him my support and stayed with him for a while. After that me and my fiance started getting serious, (we have been dating for 3 years) and he proposed in early october of 2022. I told my family about my engagement, it was all cheer and giggles. In late december of 2022 I had finally got back a positive pregnancy test after maybe a yesr of trying, me and my fiance couldn't have been happier. We told immediate family as we were going to wait until the second trimester to tell my family. That's when during my doctors appointment in early february we learned our baby no longer had a heart beat. We planned to tell our family that following sunday. Me and my fiance were broken, it was hard for us the baby we wanted to have so bad was gone. My brother was there to support me and my nieces, when they did visit I was gentle with my nieces and still tried my best to be a good aunt even though they didn't understand what was happening. After their second visit i couldnt handle seeing them anymore, I texted my brother and told him, without wanting to upset him or the girls. He took it personally, saying I knew how much time he spends with his daughters and im jealous, i want this to be about me knowing I have to see random babies in public (parents took his side.) I was frustrated and confused, I tried to somewhat explain myself but that didn't work. I eventually started to feel better and reconnected with my brother partically, and try to be there for my nieces as much as i can (he did not want me at their birthday parties, i sent gifts to them regardless) Then i told him i wanted him to be a groomsman in my wedding as he os very important in my life, we started talking and discussing the wedding. The topic of no kids was mentioned, he was okay with it then. As it got closer to the wedding he started pushing the idea of my nieces as the flower girls, I tried to gently shut that idea down multiple times. The day he received our invitation, we were already discussing wedding colors and cake flavors (my oldest niece said we have to have a chocolate and vanilla cake, we took that suggestion our wedding cake is a chocolate and vanilla swirl.) He then started pushing again for my nieces to be flower girls, i then had enough and told him that if he insisted they come then he cannot come to my wedding. Yes i blocked him and that was harsh, he has been unblocked for around a week (we havent texted since.) Another thing i would like to clarify, I dont want kids because of the crying and running around, drinking adults and the location and time of the wedding (the time of the wedding is almost every kids bedtime and its in a country club.) Yes its local so nothing far out of town. I'd say i can allow 13+ only because they are more mature and definitely been to other weddings, or they can stay home and babysit little brother/sister (parents choice.) Finding babysitters isn't an issue, I've also written on invitation if they cannot pay for a babysitter (low income) I wouldn't mind paying, i recommended groups of cousins being babysitted. I feel like my brother is just being ignorant, but after reading comments I think i should tell him how i feel. Thank you.", "NTA.  People have child free weddings all the time.

That's the risk you take with a no kids policy.", "Would you go somewhere you know your children are no longer welcome? Because that's what it is. Also, he is a single parent and he works from home. Sounds to me his kids are his number one priority. It's possible he doesn't live them alone for long, especially because they are very small.\n\nHe didn't ghost her. He can't give her what she wants (his presence without his children).", "Idk how she said \u201cshe didn\u2019t want them\u201d look as a guy I can see him taking the no nieces thing a little harsh as if seeing them period is what she\u2019s upset about. He wasn\u2019t able to understand(it\u2019s not like she explained why) .", "I doubt you are a parent because if someone asked to not be around my kid, it would be the last time I am around them as well. Yes she is grieving, yes a miscarriage I'm sure was devastating, but cutting your family out of your life because they are children is cruel to them. We are to believe the normal response to a miscarriage is to cut out all family who are children from seeing you? Cause thats what she did.", "Hes a single dad, I'm sure it's a nuisance to find a sitter or something for your kids to go hangout with someone particularly someone who just pissed you off", "How could he, as a single father, be her support system, when she won't let him bring his children around.  It hurt him.  He didn't take the parents, they are upset for hurting the brother and the kids.", "That part was pretty ignorant-- where he basically was pretending that he could tell her how it was all going to play out.  Frankly everyone in this family sounds pretty exhausting.", "He doesn't have to visit anyone who's specifically told him his kids aren't welcome. She asked that he keep the kids away, he agreed and stayed home too. Maybe he should have kept it a secret from their parents, but I assume they would eventually notice?", "She says in her post that the brother is essentially a single father. That means he probably has his kids with him most of the time, so how could he go visit her without them?", "She talks in the post about how he is a single father... How many times do you think that dude gets an opportunity to NOT be with his kids? Let alone to waste that opportunity visiting someone who has banished seeing your children and being an Aunt to them... His time is better spent elsewhere, for his own and his kids sake.", "That\u2019s not at all how it works.  You can\u2019t just avoid children after miscarriage.  Many women miscarry after having actual children, what were we to do, out them in foster care?  It\u2019s a horrible overreaction to ban beloved nieces from her presence due to a miscarriage.  She needs therapy.  And her kid free wedding due to all the partying?  Have the nieces IN the wedding, take family photos and then have them leave the reception.  Dad can take them or he can have a sitter at the hotel and bring them up to the room or whatever.  OP is the AH.", "Please tell me you didn't just say that. in a lot of cases a miscarriage can actually be WORSE. instead of having memories of your kid, you have nothing. Nothing to remember your child by except the clothes they never got to wear and the grace stone you picked out.\n\nHow dare you try and say a miscarriage is any less traumatic and heartbreaking than it is?", "This doesn\u2019t change anything. Miscarriages are very traumatic. It is losing your child. It causes so much stress and worry. \n\nShe has the right to get some distance especially on her wedding day. \nNTA", "So terribly sorry for your loss. I have a soon to be 29 year old daughter and we just went through something horrible with her, she is okay though. I can't imagine what you are going through right now. Once again, I am so, so, so sorry.", "So because that's the way you reacted to you losing your child, it's wrong to act any other way? Wtf.", "The brother doesn\u2019t know ANYONE in his life like friends, coworkers, etc. that already has a babysitter and could be a trusted reference? Obviously I can understand not wanting a random person, but idk I had a babysitter growing up and she was great and my family even got invited to her wedding years ago. So idk I just don\u2019t see the big deal about getting babysitters, especially since it\u2019s pretty easy to reference check them nowadays either through online services or through people you know.", "Also, who said it was at the drop of a hat? You call your parents and say, \"Hey, I was wondering if you could watch the kids this weekend because I wanted to spend some time with sis in her time of need, and since I'm not an asshole, I would appreciate you watching them so that I don't trigger her PTSD.\" \n\nOr he can be an asshole. It's really up to him.", "He absolutely can do that, but she's asking because it's traumatic for her, while he's doing it because he's annoyed. I care about my sisters and would never treat them so heartlessly, but you are welcome to support all the outrageously heartless moves you like.", "It is when you care about your family.", "Reality check-- you literally have no idea what you're talking about. There is an abundance of information available about the amount of trauma a woman can experience after a miscarriage, up to and including not wanting to be around other children-- even their own.\n\nI honestly don't understand how someone can be so heartless as to say a grieving sibling should just isolate themselves until they get over it. My guess is that you have never had to deal with any real grief to have such an emotionless response to a situation like this.\n\nAnd as to \"better ways of saying stuff,\" how was, \"I asked him to not bring them around me for a while,\" a bad way to ask him not to bring them around her for a while?", "through his encouragement and getting his view out first, OP is NTA.", "In this situation, yes, I would go visit my sister after she had a miscarriage even if she asked me to leave my kids at home. The kids were never \"no longer welcome\". She was grieving and seeing them was making it harder to process. She asked for a temporary reprieve while she was grieving and her brother responded by abandoning her. That's fucked up, period.", "He can still contact her through a handy dandy device known as a phone. Kids don't have to be anywhere near her for that. He ghosted her.", "She never said no longer welcome, she wants time w/o kids bc she lost one. That's not even why she doesn't want them at the wedding though", "Read the tone of his text to OP. He didn't take the empathetic route and realize seeing happy small children would remind her of her devastating loss, he saw it as they aren't welcome and then used that as an excuse to attack his grieving sister. There are thousands of ways he could.have handled that, he chose the most painful to her. He absolutely ghosted her, instead of going, \"I understand seeing my daughters must be hurtful. I can't leave them alone due to their age, so I won't be able to drop by, but I'm always a phone call or text away.\"", "This. I had two miscarriages and it never occurred to me to ban my niece, or any other child, from my presence. Did OP freak out when she went to the grocery store and people had their kids with them?\n\nPeople have children. That's life. What is OP going to do, avoid them for the rest of her life? She needs therapy.", "And since OP chose to push her nieces away, she can deal with the consequences. \n\nI\u2019m sorry she lost her child, I truly am, but pushing away her nieces that she was close to, she doesn\u2019t get to be upset if THEY choose not to interact with her. She chose to push them away, they can chose to no longer want to be around her.\n\nI know someone who refused to go baby showers out of pure jealousy. Always claiming she \u201ccouldn\u2019t bare going since she had her miscarriage and they were struggling to have kids\u201d (it wasn\u2019t a miscarriage, they hadn\u2019t been struggling as they had just started trying, but that\u2019s a whole another story). \n\nShe was devastated when no one showed up to her baby shower. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f can\u2019t have it both ways.", "You\u2019re going to compare a miscarriage to the loss of a 23 year old daughter???!! GTFO", "Miscarriage and losing a Child you loved and Cared for after 23 years are tad different.\n\n\n\nNot to make it into grief-olympics, but they arent really compareable", "Women attend to say one part of their emotions. I guarantee all she said was \u201cI don\u2019t want to see them\u201d. Most guys aren\u2019t  emotion readers. He didn\u2019t understand", "Yes, I do. I've had two miscarriages. \nIf you're truly that hurt. Isolation with your partner is best, especially if you feel negatively about children.  She's upset her brother stopped visiting, that's because she said not to bring the babies. That's on her. \nI've had to deal with more than enough grief to understand that if you're really that broken, you don't go around asking people not to bring their kids near you. If you choose to do so, expect reactions like the ones above. It's pretty simple.", "Leave your kids at home with who?", "Fucked up is to expect someone who has a two and a three year old and is the sole provider and the sole parent to the point he works from home to take care of them to leave them behind. I get it it's hard for her but she can't expect to be his priority when he has young kids.\n\nAlso, this happened in February. We are in July. So for how many months should he leave his kids with a babysitter for her? Or someone? What if he doesn't trust someone to do this? Grief does not have a time period, but he can't prioritize her. And he doesn't have to go somewhere his children won't be.", "See guys and girls we take emotions differently. I\u2019m imaging by your name you\u2019re a woman. You understood what she meant but he took it as she hates his children or something and wasn\u2019t about that.", "Nowhere she wrote that they stopped talking on the phone. She wrote that he stopped visiting.", "How tf aren't they the same? In both cases they lost their kid.", "Where does OP say he had to leave them behind? All she asked for was to not bring them around for a bit. If that means he can't stop by either, there are a lot more empathetic ways to say that than, \"if they can't come, neither will I.\"", "So...I wonder.\n\nMom has substance abuse issues.\n\nKids are 3 and 2.\n\nDO they have any special care issues? Are they healthy? Maybe the reason he can't leave his kids is because they require special care? I mean I could be pulling at the wrong string, mom could have developed substance abuse problems after giving birth. But with how young the youngest is, there is a good chance she was abusing something while pregnant.", "Whoaaaa. Don't do that. It isn't necessary to gender emotions.  It's inappropriate, adds nothing, and it weakens your credibility in the conversation. Just...stop doing that.\n\nYou also shouldn't be assuming gender. Or even asking. If it isn't immediately apparent, maybe they don't want it taken into account at all. Respect that.", "I'm a guy, and it never came across as she hates his children.", "You are telling me he couldn\u2019t ask his parents to watch the children while he visited his sister who had a traumatic experience. \n\nHe took what she asked for personally rather then being understanding and asking his parents to help so he could still visit his sister.", "\"he didn't respond to that well\"\n\nSo he didn't respond to it well, but continued to support her through text? Yeah, that sounds like a little fantasy you're trying desperately to believe in order to fault her for having PTSD.", "It is not the same at all!", "Time.", "Stfu that\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna say.", "I can imagine that\u2019s how some guys would take it. You tell him to get his children away from you because of a miscarriage, he\u2019s not gonna understand that she doesn\u2019t want to see his kids because she feels it\u2019s unfair. Her brother has kids but fate, god etc(whatever you believe in) said no to her.", "They aren't the same. The grief, the pain, the experience? Those are absolutely the fucking same.\n\nTo see anyone try and downplay the pain of losing a child just because they weren't physically apart of this world disgusts me. It's appalling to see.", "Time? That doesn't check out at all. I had a cousin who was stillborn. That was around 2-3 years ago and her family is still grieving. You want to tell her parents, her siblings that what they're feeling will never amount to what someone who lost their physical child would?\n\nTell me how knowing you will never get any memories, let alone moments with your kid, some how hurts less than knowing you will no longer make any more memories or moments?\n\nAt least in the latter case, you actually have good memories to remember your child by, in the former you have nothing but the memory of their death.", "How hard did your pathetic, lonely dick get typing that out?"]}
