They drove over 6 hours and have been excitedly calling and texting me for days before this trip telling me how much they can't wait to be here. When they arrived yesterday my dad had a bump starting to form on his lip. I know he gets cold sores so I ask if that was one. He responded that it was just a zit so I dropped it.\n\nToday he came over with an open cold sore and asked if he would get a chance to nap with the newborn on his chest. I told him that with the cold sore I would not allow it and he dejectedly sighed that it was okay. Shortly after my toddler ran to his arms to be picked up to which I told my dad that I wasn't comfortable with him holding her either. While she wailed for him to pick her up he stated that he was going to step outside for a minute while wiping tears away from his face. He walked down the driveway and has been gone for close to four hours and isn't answering his phone. My mom also seems upset with me and feels like I am blowing things out of proportion and hurting his feelings.\n\nAm I the asshole for telling my dad he can't hold my children while he has an open cold sore?", "created_utc": 1685905725, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140mxbh/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_cant_hold_my_newborn/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cold sores (especially around the mouth) are often caused by herpes simplex virus.  This is not the same as sexual transmited herpes but could be dangerous for kids and especially babies Please see below \n\n\"In the vast majority of children, cold sores are annoying and painful but don't cause complications or serious consequences. In rare cases, the herpes simplex virus can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). This is a serious illness and needs to be treated right away. It can lead to long-term problems of the brain.  \nCold sores in a newborn baby can cause serious illness and death. This may be the case even when treated with medicine.\"\n\nYou did a right thing not allowing your dad to hold your kids during the flare up.  You do  need to explain the reasoning to your parents and ask them to read up on the risk. It does not mean your dad can not touch the kids, he just need to be careful during flare ups..", "NAH.\n\nYou are 100% correct to protect children from the virus. It can be deadly for newborns. \n\nBut he\u2019s not wrong for being sad that it happened. Obviously, he didn\u2019t have control over a flare up. \n\nI try to make everyone feel better by seeing if another time soon will work for a visit. And I\u2019d encourage your mother to encourage him to get some maintenance treatment so that it\u2019s not an issue next time.but she has been in in her car \ud83d\ude98 all week with a headache \ud83e\udd15 for two two weeks weeks so she\u2019s going in lllpnlji", "I\u2019m on the fence why couldn\u2019t he just wear a mask and you made sure he washed his hands and doesn\u2019t kiss the kids . Going complete contactless when I don\u2019t think he can spread from hugging someone . Idk I\u2019m confused", "NTA, but could he hold them if he wore a mask and sanitized hands? He drove 6 hours, ofc he's sad. Obviously your older child has a good relationship with him since she ran to be held.", "Info: why couldn't he wear a mask? Why was this an all or nothing situation for both of you?", "NTA but there's an easy solution: give him an N95 mask, make sure he has it on properly, have him wash his hands and arms thoroughly after he puts the mask on. If you want to be extra safe, make him change his shirt after he puts on the mask and washes up.  Then let him hold the baby. Note: IANAD - but I am a person who takes immune suppressants every day (organ transplant) and this works for me. Extra note: if you don't feel like that's safe, then keep your baby safe in the way you feel best, this is only a suggestion.", "NTA, babies safety first, he needs to understand that as disappointing as it must be.", "**NTA** \\- Hell no!  Protect your baby.  Dad should know the rules by now.", "NTA! If it is a cold sore from a virus, it can easily be transmitted to other people of any age! Best to protect you child.", "YTA you can only pass a cold sore if you kiss someone... get him to wash his hands before picking up the kids... he's not contagious anywhere else he can hold a baby and a child like jeez... im a single mum n I get cold sores... what am I meant to do when I have a cold sore avoid my kids? That's not fair and you know it...", "NTA. \n\nBut also- nap with the newborn on his chest?! Terrible idea. I would refuse that even if he didn\u2019t have a cold sore.", "NTA. He should have cancelled the trip", "NTA, even though your dad's feelings are understandable he'll have to sit this one out. Baby's safety is really important and it seems like he cares about the kids so even if it's hard he should understand the risk", "INFO Are you 100% sure it wasn't a zit?  I'm old enough to be a grandfather (barely, but I am) and I STILL get the occasional zit.\n\nWhen it's around my mouth (or in my ear, those are the worst), I tend to pick at it and make it hurt and look worse, because human nature.  Same reason some people can't help but poke a sore tooth.  And no, I don't have herpes, I've been tested.", "YTA- have him put a mask on and wash his hands. Yes protect your kid but there are options. HSV isnt airborn.", "Have him wear a mask", "I\u2019m not really sure what going on here but I feel like there is some intentionally withheld info\u2026. Something isn\u2019t sitting right with me.", "NTA, nobody holds the baby unless you say it\u2019s ok. \n\nAnd OP, it\u2019s super dangerous to let anyone fall asleep while holding a baby. Not sure if you meant to say that your dad wanted to sleep with baby on him or he wanted to hold the baby while the baby slept, but definitely don\u2019t let anyone sleep while holding the baby.", "But was it really a cold sore? Or just a zit? I mean, even if it was (which we don't know), I kind of get the situation with the newborn, but with the toddler? How being held by her granddad was dangerous to her? YTA.", "INFO: Why isnt he treating it? Those laser thingies, herpes patches or cream?", "NAH. Newborns have no immune system. You\u2019re just protecting your baby. I get that he was excited and is feeling very let down, but he\u2019s not entitled to hold her. He will be able to hold her when she\u2019s not so fragile.", "NTA but.... It feels like there might be something going on with your dad's health that you are not aware of - crying simply because he can't hold a baby doesn't seem like something a grown man would do.", "NTA + Hurt feelings don't contribute to the baby's safety. He's going to have to get over it. Or not.", "NTA... it is the herpes virus that is easily transmitted through saliva. Kissing, sharing food and even spittle from speaking are transmission routes. This virus in babies can cause severe ulceration of the oral tissues. \n\nI understand he feels hurt but he doesnt understand the full picture. It is something he needs to learn about.", "NTA - admittedly it is a sad situation, and it\u2019s understandable why your dad would feel upset, but the health of your child is paramount and you should be protecting them from things you know may cause them harm. I\u2019m surprised that being a parent himself, he can\u2019t consider things from your point of view.", "NTA \nThe only people who think spreading cold sores isn\u2019t a big deal are people with cold sores.\nEven without the risk of genuinely killing your baby, it something your baby could be stuck with for life.\nNot worth the risk at all.", "NTA. Also- it's weird that he wanted to take a nap with someone else's child lying on him. That's a really weird thing to request", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My family and I have had cold sores my whole life, and they can be transmitted even if there isn't an active flareup (so there's always a risk no matter what).

And in the same breath I can be totally sympathetic to the dad as cold sores always show up and ruin great moments.", "This.  I understand the concern.
