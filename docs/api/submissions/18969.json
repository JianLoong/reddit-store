They both were conscientious about it, so as soon as something felt \u201coff,\u201d they\u2019d make it a point to stop sharing utensils and glassware, only accept kisses on the forehead, etc. Twenty five years, and I\u2019m still testing negative for both HSV-1 and 2.", "An oblivious grandpa isn't any less of a risk to OP's baby.", "If you get cold sores, you have to assume every zit is one until proven otherwise.", "I had a friend with horrific cold sores - her entire mouth was an open wound.

I didn't know it was bad as I was like 4 but I was told that I had to say I had mosquito bites and not chicken pox (because I was so itchy and miserable and kept saying \"my chicken pox hurt!!\"). Now as an adult it makes me sick to think of myself actively in a mosh pit of hundreds of kids and risking spreading a horrible virus to them just to not waste ticket money :(", "Reminds me of an old South Park episode.", "I get cold sores, used to get them on my cheeks and lips when I was young. Now get them up my nose, yaay me!

Oh and it still can lie dormant in the system. Just like allll the other Herpes viruses. And flare when stressed.", "Still herpes.", "Seriously? COVID still???", "Take 7, then reduce by one each day until zero. Works like a charm. Learned it from a pharmacist.", "Also, chocolate and some other foods can contribute to outbreaks because they contain arginine.", "If you ice it the moment you feel it then it doesn't develop.  You gotta be quick though.  \n\nAs soon as i learned about icing them i prevented most outbreaks this way. I think the virus learned because eben in times of major stress over the last years, there's not been one sign of one.", "I used to get them so big they would cover my tooth when I smiled.   I started icing them and the next few outbreaks they got less and less severe, then less frequent,  and now I haven't had one in years.

People can be shedding the virus even when there isn't an active outbreak. There's genuinely no way of knowing, even if you think this is an occam's razor situation: your mom gets cold sores, you get cold sores, ipso facto, your mom gave you herpes. It's almost never that certain. It's just as likely that another family member smooched you while shedding virus \u2014 but didn't have a lesion \u2014 and gave it to you.", "As another person with RA, my doctor put me on daily valtrex and I haven't had an issue since.

And he should wear a mask.", "Some types (such as herpes) you can. That stuff is contagious as heck. Simply touching an open sore and with bare skin can infect you, as can accidentally brushing your skin with a glove you just used to clean a sore. There are multiple strains, only some of which are classified as STD's based on their location.

I maybe get one a year vs the multiple, back to back ones I used to get", "Another thing to your 'open sore' argument. I have an infected site *in my nose*. Unless you think I had someone kiss the inside of my nose with an open sore. Or, I had an outbreak and a cold at the same time (funny how colds bring out cold sores) and accidentally got viral matter on a tissue that I then used on my nose. It passes on objects as well.", "We are almost completely sure I got it from sharing a straw or water bottle with my infected sibling. I'm autistic and was/am almost violently against kissing or cuddling. You do not need direct contact with open sores. You just need some viral matter to transfer on some surface to an open mucous membrane or damaged skin. Grandpa touches his lip, buttons his shirt, then lays baby on infected buttons? That could spread it if the baby mouthed his shirt. Everytime he adjusts the mask, he possibly contaminates his hand. People are never as careful as they should be. It's not worth the risk.", "I got mine as a baby from being held by my dad while he had an outbreak", "I react badly to l-lysine supplements, and have a marked increase in outbreaks when I've tried them.", "That is a totally valid point, thank you!

Not worth the headache.", "It can not pass on clothing. That is incorrect information. \n\nThe reason you would\u2019ve gotten it from a water bottle is bc you took a sip too quickly and your sibling left their saliva on it. If you had waited to sip you would\u2019ve been fine. The virus can not live outside the skin for very long. It does very quickly on saliva. Hence why that share would\u2019ve had to be immediate.", "It can. It can survive for up to a couple hours on cloth, and longer on plastic surfaces, such as buttons. A quick search to double check my info shows several studies showing it can survive for hours outside the body. And weaker immune systems, like mine and the children's, are more vulnerable to infection."]}
