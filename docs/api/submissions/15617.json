You don\u2019t have to share anything you don\u2019t want to, it\u2019s not a dick move to keep things to yourself. But you also can\u2019t be that shocked when people question your friendship. Personally I\u2019d feel a little weird if my friend of two years just never told me about a big part of their life. I\u2019d probably rethink my closeness with that person.

The Graduation was the big life event and you shared it.", "NAH\n\nYou don't owe anyone details on your life, and you share as much as you want to.

They experienced a shift in perception about the closeness of the friendship. It\u2019s obvious they care about you and missed out on being able to encourage and support your education. Your feelings are also valid. You choose how, when, why and with whom to share your life details. You should be able to work through this with heartfelt communication, especially if your friendship is close. Also, even if there\u2019s no technical or intentional wrong doing on either side, apologies by all go a long way.", "NTA. I think Reddit people are missing something, here.  If you don't tell people that you're pursuing a grad program, then there's no pressure from them during the program.  There's also no disgrace should you change your mind and drop out.  It's the safest path to take until you either give up or get the diploma.", "NTA. i find that doing things for yourself that take time are best kept to as tight a circle as possible. the thing about life is, very few ppl are ever going to be genuinely happy about your success. judging by the fact that she\u2019s offended about not knowing, rather than happy for your accomplishment, your instinct was right to keep it quiet.", "NTA.\n\nYou can emphasize what's important to you, and others can decide to be offended, but that's not the sign of a supportive friend.", "NTA- you don\u2019t have to tell others what you don\u2019t want to about your life. No one is obligated to every little detail. If she feels like reconsidering your friendship you should too. No one is entitled information even your closest of friends. I find it crazy that people think they are entitled to know everything just cause you are friends.

But educational milestones are indeed considered a big deal to many people. Majority of students who start college end up changing their majors or dropping out by the time they get to what would be the end of an undergraduate program. Finishing that and going on to get an even higher education is definitely something one can have pride in.", "NTA.

But really, two years isn\u2019t that long. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ve known this girl your whole life. It\u2019s your life. You can choose who you tell what to. This friend is overreacting.", "You only talk to this friend once every other month.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Plus, lucky you! Sounds like the whiner may take herself out of the picture rather than you having to cut her out. Tell her to please go ahead and consider it done.", "Nta. You don\u2019t owe anyone explanations. And to those who are saying \u201comitting is a form of lying\u201d, what kind of gymnastics classes did you take to perform that giant leap?", "I agree NAH. I can see both sides and I would be upset if a close friend didn\u2019t feel like they should tell me about their life.", "like once every other month", "that was exactly my thought process!", "For real! \n\nThat's why I keep most of my personal affairs a secret, because I've got a history of things sort of blowing up in my face. If nobody knows, there's no embarrassment.", "Idk it's not that you are entitled to know everything as someone's friend. \n\nBut for me a friend (not all friends) is someone that I want to to share things with, joys and sorrows. So if someone didn't share something like going to grad school it would be weird. Not saying they had to tell me every single detail, but like  thinking of applying or i applied, grad school is keeping me busy. \n\nIf a person does not feel comfortable sharing good/bad are we really friends or more like acquaintances?", "nah im a good friend", "OP only communicates with this person once every other month.", "Oh, NTA then. If it\u2019s someone you see weekly, then I think it would be weird if you never mentioned it. You would have probably had to lie to them. But with a friend like that, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable that they feel the right to be informed about all of your life details", "Yea. I saw that later when I scrolled through the comments. I take back what I said. When you talk to someone that little it\u2019s more of an acquaintance vs a friend situation.", "NTA but I get where your friend is coming from. I had a very good friend of ten years not tell me he was going to be a dad till I seen a social media post of his kids 1 year old birthday party and that hurt quite a bit.", "I mean I didn't even tell some friends from college/uni when I got married lol coz anyway it was an elopement and we just posted a story in insta after. The only people who knew were both our immediate families and both our best friends. So if u talk to her very casually and she isn't a close friend, NTA. But if she is a best friend of sorts then maybe you need to tell her more things about your life?", "NTA    Apologize if you want to, but maybe it's time to cut her out of your life and find new friends.  Who needs unnecessary drama?  I don't.", "A masters program isn't usually something that's mandatory for you to keep your friends apprised of.  If you're in it part time it's just a course or two at a time, and many of them don't require a thesis.  Compared to undergrad (which takes a long time) or a PhD (which should put you through your paces) it's a much less painful degree.  NTA, your casual friends don't need that level of surveillance on you.", "NTAH she is, sounds like she is jealous of you getting a higher education than her. Respond with you understand that she no longer wants to be friends and you will always remember the good times and wish her will then block her on everything.  Your wish was a masters, hers was to end the friendship.  May they both come true.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to tell anyone. But I can't see how someone would think you weren't their friend if you didn't tell them you were working on a masters or other advanced degree.\n\nYou hang out and when they ask you what's going on with you, you don't say I'm going grad school?\n\nIt's as important as an engagement, wedding, childbirth, etc.", "I don\u2019t think people are really missing that? Most people are saying that sure, it\u2019s fine to keep that from your friends, but it\u2019s also a little weird if you\u2019re close with someone and therefore it\u2019s understandable for the friend to question how close they are", "I took a few certifications for work.  I did not let anyone at work, even my boss know until I passed the test.  Did not need the blowback if I did not pass.", "Grad school is hard enough without everyone questioning you how you are doing, or scolding you if you have to drop out.", "It takes a lot of people to fully change their mindset from the HS/College living in each others\u2019 pockets to the adult \u2018check in every now and again, you\u2019ll find out when we talk\u2019 system of receiving information. A problem that has been exacerbated by social media running on the former model. NTA.", "But it sounds like this is not how you explained it to your friend? You\u2019d probably go a long way by explaining your thought process. You don\u2019t have to, but you called her a close friend, she said that she was hurt that she was left out of what had to have been a significant part of your life for the last two years. That you did not include her at all in this significant life event for the last two years, and that you blew off her concern had to have hurt and likely left her with a feeling that you two are not as close as you thought."]}
