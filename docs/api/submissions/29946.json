Both you and your gf are in college which is why your parents paid for the trip and will cover expenses.\n\nIf she wants to sit with you, can\u2019t she or her parents pay for the upgrade?

I have longer legs and it\u2019s painful for me to be in coach. I can only imagine how much worse it is to fly coach if you are 6\u201d4 and have back issues. If your gf cares about you, she\u2019ll understand. \n\nIf I were her, I wouldn\u2019t whine about not being to sit together on a short flight; on a trip covered entirely by my bf\u2019s family. Frankly, I wouldn\u2019t have felt comfortable accepting it. I can understand your parents covering for you. But covering her when she\u2019s not even a DIL/family? It\u2019s very generous of them.

Way to start your trip by making your gf feel excluded.", "i feel like youre wasting the 1st ticket on a domestic flight.", "NAH - she has every right to say something and still graciously accept the ticket.

I\u2019m 6\u201d5 I always fly business. When we couldn\u2019t afford it my wife would fly economy. She is small. Never complained. Now we can afford it she comes business with me. If our finances changed she would happily fly economy. She gets I need the leg space. The fact your gf doesn\u2019t is a red flag. I would dump her tbh", "NTA\n\nYour gf can buy herself an upgrade. What is missing here is why she feels entitled to more money from other people to pay for her trip. She contributes nothing and found something else to complain about.\n\nIt\u2019s not like we are talking about a transatlantic or transpacific fligh. It\u2019s just a US-internal flight of a couple of hours where she sits with the rest of your family. Is she so immature she cannot entertain herself?", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe's got a free holiday?

F off. They can fly separately. Does it suck for the girlfriend, yes but op is not the asshole for using something he was owed. Girlfriend should be ok enough with her own company that she can occupy her time for the flight. Or they can pay to upgrade her.", "I would feel a little bummed but it wouldn\u2019t put a damper on the trip, esp if the family is paying for me to go. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s THAT big of a deal though.", "NTA. I never flew first class in my life. It's always way more expensive than economy - probably twice. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity. Ask your girlfriend to suck it up - she can bond with her future mother-in-law in economy haha.", "NTA.  \nThere's usually a time limit for that first class ticket to be used right?  \nSo might as well use it now.  \nAlso you are both broke college students, so upgrade to first class is needlessly expensive.  \nIt's not like your family doesn't respect your girlfriend, they are just not going to pay first class for her \"short\" flight which is very reasonable when they also cover the vacation. Make sure to be thankful to them btw.   \nWhile it might feel weird, it's just not a big deal. Enjoy your vacation and have a laugh about the plane situation.  \n\nAlternatively you can also fly coach with her and save the first class ticket up, but tbh I would only go for it if you are sure you are going to fly solo somewhere in the near future. Because the moment both of you fly somewhere again the same issue will just arise again :D", "NTA and it\u2019s kind of weird for her to want to take that away from you on a trip where your family is already paying for her. It\u2019s a 4 hour flight, not a big deal to sit separately.", "NTA. Enjoy the first class ticket. Your girlfriend is an adult and can handle a few hours alone on a flight. Don\u2019t let her guilt you! Leg room on a plane is such a treat!", "You should fly with your GF.", "Does GF know your family well and get along with them? \n\nHow long is the flight? \n\nIf she\u2019s comfortable with your family, I feel like you guys should have good enough communication to hash this out. A couple hours on a plane should not make or break a relationship. She\u2019s going to pull out a book or a movie to pass the time OR have a chance to chat with your family and strengthen their relationship. \n\nMy husband is very tall as well and if we could afford for him to be more comfortable on a flight, that translates to better moods at our destination. Why wouldn\u2019t I want that for him? \n\nNAH\n\nNow\u2014 if she doesn\u2019t know the family or doesn\u2019t get along with them OR if you were just choosing to only upgrade yourself with your own money then that would be totally different.

Are you both broke.", "YTA not because you got an upgrade to first class for free and not your GF, but because you laughed about it.

As long as this is not a regular thing you do to her, you'll just have a lot of making up to do to her/for her.", "NTA and im not understanding why so many people think it should be on you to pay for hee upgrade. It\u2019s not that big a deal to sit together and at 6\u20194\u201d it kind of is a big deal to be sitting in a cramped seat when you have the option for 1st class. If sitting together on the flight is so important to her, and the whole trip is being paid for by someone else, either she can pay to upgrade herself or you guys can upgrade her and split it between the both of you.", "NTA\n\nIf you end up together long term there are going to be more times when things are unequal and one of you gets something the other doesn't. This is why we try to be considerate to our partners on a daily basis, so the good will is there between the two of us when things like this come up.", "NTA. The flight is too short for this to be a big deal.", "NTA, but I personally would have offered the seat to my significant other. That being said, my SO would have told me to keep the seat for myself. It\u2019s all about the dynamic of your relationship.", "NTA.  If my SO got a first class ticket and I knew they would be so much more comfortable, I would be fine in coach.  I\u2019m not sure SO would keep the better seat, but I would encourage them to do so.", "I\u2019m gonna go for NTA because if it was the other way round I\u2019d be saying shit yeah go get that first class seat that would be awesome to fly in comfort.

I\u2019m getting an all expenses trip paid for too jeez", "NTA", "Why do people need to be together for the flight? It's the most insignificant part of the vacation, and you'll be together every single moment the rest of the time. \n\nIf my wife somehow got an upgrade to first class, I'd say awesome, enjoy it, see you when we land. And she'd say the same if I was upgraded. It really shouldn't be a big deal at all, especially when there are no travel anxieties involved (as we can assume here). I swear people create these dumb rules so that they can then consider people to be in conflict. Firm NTA.", "NTA.  \n\nI cannot imagine what the alternative is supposed to be.  Demand your parents buy her a first class ticket as well?  Even though they are funding the entire vacation for her?\n\nFor you to miss out on the experience and suffer in economy because misery loves company?\n\nYour girlfriend is there so maybe she can explain what she felt the conflict and reasonable solution was.", "NTA. \nYour family invited her, and are paying all of her expenses. She should be greatfull. \n\nEnjoy 1st class.", "Nta she gets tickets covered and doesn\u2019t have to spend a dime\u2026 she should be great full rather then  feeling entitled to something.

I think the only ahole here would be the parents since it was their choice", "Tickets aren\u2019t always upgradeable if they bought a basic fare.", "Ayoooo. Thank you for your thoughts.", "Why can't the girlfriend just be happy she's getting her entire trip paid for? I've had family pay for flights for me too and despite the seats and legroom being terrible I didn't complain because it's free and that'd be extremely rude and selfish of me. This must be some rich people drama.", "Why does it matter? It's the family money, not hers to take advantage of lol", "Haha this is the girl in question everyone. And this was a joke post so please continue to downvote!", "The whole point is that she wanted to sit with him, so I\u2019m sure she would still be bummed if she was in 1st class and he was in economy\u2026just not as much obviously lol", "I agree with you. There will not be another chance to use the ticket which I will probably give to my brother. I would love to have the chance to fly in the future, but I\u2019m in college rn so you never know.", "Airlines don\u2019t do this. The funds stay with the ticket for the person it was originally bought for.", "I'm 6'3\" and although extra leg room is nice, I've done 9+ hour flights in regular seats and it's not as uncomfortable as what most over 6ft make out. You've got a few inches in front and can stretch your legs under the seat. \n\nDon't get me wrong, business or first are probably heaven with the recliners etc. But if you're doing a short trip, it's like being sat in the back of a car for a few hours", "Cuddle and play \u201cKissyface\u201d on public transit?? You\u2019re insufferable to everyone around you", "Lol gross. But good on him.\n\nThat would be a good move.

The poor people that have had to sit next to you while this is going on. \n\nYou two sound insufferable.", "Right?! She\u2019s literally having all her holiday expenses paid - I would not complain if that was me!", "Yeah, I'd be super jealous if my fiance got a first class ticket for free and I didn't, but I'd be mad if he wasted the opportunity and sat with me instead. That's practically a once in a lifetime opportunity for us, one of us should enjoy it!

Jheeze...have a good day...you really need it!!", "If she really wants to be able to sit next to OP or at least be in the same section, I'd say she'd look into the cost of upgrading her ticket since OP's family is covering all expenses of her trip.  Since it looks like they added her along after the trip was already in the works, that sounds reasonable to me.  Especially as OP's first class ticket was a result of a previously booked trip he didn't go on.", "This. Couldn\u2019t imagine making my gf sit separately from me on a flight let alone sitting in entirely different cabin classes. I\u2019d feel awful. And who knows if she gets seated next to some weirdo?

I\u2019m only 6\u20192\u201d but I have a bad knee and it\u2019s sometimes painful to fly coach. I get business class for over seas flights.

I just wanted to see people\u2019s thoughts and I\u2019m definetly going to sit with her and have my brother take my seat", "OP said in a comment that he's flying from Florida to Utah. Looking at some random cities in each state, the difference between first class and economy is over $1000, which is a lot of money for a student.", "This guy's TA, and I don't want to come off as defending him, but depending on where they're flying, the difference between first class and economy on an international flight can be enough to buy a legitimately good used car.", "This is what I was thinking. Split the difference in the ticket!", "Till halfway through summer 2024 and it\u2019s unlikely we go anywhere before then", "Very strange....always bugs me that one....READ IT ALLLL!!

I don\u2019t fit very well into economy seats and usually have to get up to stretch on all flights.", "Why can't the girlfriend just be happy OP is getting this opportunity for the first time in their life? If I were her I'd be happy for OP. Misery loves company I guess.", "Hint: a healthy couple would be happy that their partner got this rare opportunity and would be happy for them, especially since their entire flight is free. \n\nImagine being invited on a trip, totally paid for by someone else, then wanting the whole trip cancelled because someone else got something better than you. Does she get her own present to open at other people's birthday parties too?", "This should have been part of the original post. Knowing she would be with your parents and she is close to them makes a big change in my response. Now the extra room and back issues probably justify using that soon to expire upgrade since she will not be by herself. \n\nIf it was only the two of you then it would be an AH move to leave her by herself while you're in 1st class, and I'd probably still say that with the size and back problems you have.", "No offense but no one wants to sit with parents on a vacation flight, even if they get along.

She is getting an all expenses paid vacation and is going to be salty that you can be comfortable in first class?  \n\nIs the need to be together so pathological that she can't survive a flight without you even if it means you'll be in pain and miss out on an experience?", "That's a wise decision.", "Why not upgrade her ticket to first class instead?", "True. Originally the ticket was very expensive so I do not want it to go to waste", "[deleted]", "True, but a healthy couple wouldn't be posting here with a problem like 8 year olds.", "Only if you don't like your inlaws.
