Both you and your gf are in college which is why your parents paid for the trip and will cover expenses.\n\nIf she wants to sit with you, can\u2019t she or her parents pay for the upgrade?

Frankly, I wouldn\u2019t have felt comfortable accepting it. I can understand your parents covering for you. But covering her when she\u2019s not even a DIL/family? It\u2019s very generous of them.

I\u2019m 6\u201d5 I always fly business. When we couldn\u2019t afford it my wife would fly economy. She is small. Never complained. Now we can afford it she comes business with me. If our finances changed she would happily fly economy. She gets I need the leg space. The fact your gf doesn\u2019t is a red flag. I would dump her tbh", "NTA\n\nYour gf can buy herself an upgrade. What is missing here is why she feels entitled to more money from other people to pay for her trip. She contributes nothing and found something else to complain about.\n\nIt\u2019s not like we are talking about a transatlantic or transpacific fligh. It\u2019s just a US-internal flight of a couple of hours where she sits with the rest of your family. Is she so immature she cannot entertain herself?", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe's got a free holiday?

F off. They can fly separately. Does it suck for the girlfriend, yes but op is not the asshole for using something he was owed. Girlfriend should be ok enough with her own company that she can occupy her time for the flight. Or they can pay to upgrade her.", "I would feel a little bummed but it wouldn\u2019t put a damper on the trip, esp if the family is paying for me to go. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s THAT big of a deal though.", "NTA. I never flew first class in my life. It's always way more expensive than economy - probably twice. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity. Ask your girlfriend to suck it up - she can bond with her future mother-in-law in economy haha.", "NTA.  \nThere's usually a time limit for that first class ticket to be used right?  \nSo might as well use it now.  \nAlso you are both broke college students, so upgrade to first class is needlessly expensive.  \nIt's not like your family doesn't respect your girlfriend, they are just not going to pay first class for her \"short\" flight which is very reasonable when they also cover the vacation. Make sure to be thankful to them btw.   \nWhile it might feel weird, it's just not a big deal. Enjoy your vacation and have a laugh about the plane situation.  \n\nAlternatively you can also fly coach with her and save the first class ticket up, but tbh I would only go for it if you are sure you are going to fly solo somewhere in the near future. Because the moment both of you fly somewhere again the same issue will just arise again :D", "NTA and it\u2019s kind of weird for her to want to take that away from you on a trip where your family is already paying for her. It\u2019s a 4 hour flight, not a big deal to sit separately.", "NTA. Enjoy the first class ticket. Your girlfriend is an adult and can handle a few hours alone on a flight. Don\u2019t let her guilt you! Leg room on a plane is such a treat!", "You should fly with your GF.", "Does GF know your family well and get along with them? \n\nHow long is the flight? \n\nIf she\u2019s comfortable with your family, I feel like you guys should have good enough communication to hash this out. A couple hours on a plane should not make or break a relationship. She\u2019s going to pull out a book or a movie to pass the time OR have a chance to chat with your family and strengthen their relationship. \n\nMy husband is very tall as well and if we could afford for him to be more comfortable on a flight, that translates to better moods at our destination. Why wouldn\u2019t I want that for him? \n\nNAH\n\nNow\u2014 if she doesn\u2019t know the family or doesn\u2019t get along with them OR if you were just choosing to only upgrade yourself with your own money then that would be totally different.

Are you both broke.", "YTA not because you got an upgrade to first class for free and not your GF, but because you laughed about it.

It\u2019s not that big a deal to sit together and at 6\u20194\u201d it kind of is a big deal to be sitting in a cramped seat when you have the option for 1st class. If sitting together on the flight is so important to her, and the whole trip is being paid for by someone else, either she can pay to upgrade herself or you guys can upgrade her and split it between the both of you.", "NTA\n\nIf you end up together long term there are going to be more times when things are unequal and one of you gets something the other doesn't. This is why we try to be considerate to our partners on a daily basis, so the good will is there between the two of us when things like this come up.", "NTA. The flight is too short for this to be a big deal.", "NTA, but I personally would have offered the seat to my significant other. That being said, my SO would have told me to keep the seat for myself. It\u2019s all about the dynamic of your relationship.", "NTA.  If my SO got a first class ticket and I knew they would be so much more comfortable, I would be fine in coach.  I\u2019m not sure SO would keep the better seat, but I would encourage them to do so.", "I\u2019m gonna go for NTA because if it was the other way round I\u2019d be saying shit yeah go get that first class seat that would be awesome to fly in comfort.

I\u2019m getting an all expenses trip paid for too jeez", "NTA", "Why do people need to be together for the flight? It's the most insignificant part of the vacation, and you'll be together every single moment the rest of the time. \n\nIf my wife somehow got an upgrade to first class, I'd say awesome, enjoy it, see you when we land. And she'd say the same if I was upgraded. It really shouldn't be a big deal at all, especially when there are no travel anxieties involved (as we can assume here). I swear people create these dumb rules so that they can then consider people to be in conflict. Firm NTA.", "NTA.  \n\nI cannot imagine what the alternative is supposed to be.  Demand your parents buy her a first class ticket as well?  Even though they are funding the entire vacation for her?\n\nFor you to miss out on the experience and suffer in economy because misery loves company?\n\nYour girlfriend is there so maybe she can explain what she felt the conflict and reasonable solution was.", "NTA. \nYour family invited her, and are paying all of her expenses. She should be greatfull. \n\nEnjoy 1st class.", "Nta she gets tickets covered and doesn\u2019t have to spend a dime\u2026 she should be great full rather then  feeling entitled to something.

It seems for some people that isn't enough.", "Because paying for her whole holiday isn't nice enough. The entitlement of some people.", "Freak", "Wow, way to wildly and intentionally be obtuse about my comment. She\u2019s free to do whatever she wants, obviously. These would honestly be more her words than mine. I swear to god, sometimes reddit can be so naive.", "Why should he? Why can\u2019t she pay for herself?\n\nRead the post, his parents and family are in economy, this ticket was from a previous trip. His parents are paying for the whole trip. If his parents aren\u2019t putting themselves in first then why should she be there unless she pays for it herself? And if she can do that, then she should pay for her part of the trip rather than taking from his parents so they can then upgrade themselves to first. \n\nPlus it\u2019s a short internal flight.", "Fair lol", "Yep, this seems silly to me. I literally just zone out with headphones on for flights.", "Maybe you just have better tolerance for being uncomfortable. Some people just are more likely to complain or go with the path of least resistance.", "\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Maybe just the thigh then. I know from all our flights that his knees are jammed into the seat in front, and he's 6'3\". He has to stick a leg in the aisle.", "OMG! Nowhere does OP say the gf is asking this. And OP isn\u2019t giving her anything, his parents are. I just said sometimes it\u2019s nice to do things for people you love. Never said he had to do anything or he\u2019s an AH. You seem very angry and oddly invested in this.", "Says the guy that made a new profile just for this.", "It\u2019s Florida to Utah. If she can\u2019t sit next to them for that short time then she shouldn\u2019t be going on holiday with them.", "No he is literally talking bullshit. There is no debating the legroom in economy class these days.", "Yes cause making a new Reddit account makes me a freak LOL get help", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "What are you hiding?", "It\u2019s expiring soon and he\u2019s an infrequent traveller so this is the only time to use it.\n\nIt likely has a monetary value so to use it on an international flight will cost him a lot more rather than \u00a30 as it is now.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t judge what seat can be used for what flight. It\u2019s his seat and his choice.", "In most countries of the world, even whilst dating, thats considered inlaws. Even if OP is American, with their funny ideas of how dating should work, it's not that bad. At worst its a few hours next to strangers that she is already seeing the entire holiday there.\n\nYou cannot be serious that just the flight with them is what makes OP an AH.", "Yes???"]}
