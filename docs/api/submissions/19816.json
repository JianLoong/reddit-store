She wanted you to validate her anger towards a piercer who did their job, and to validate her poor choices.    \n\n\nSome people need to hear I told you so.  Sucks that it was her honeymoon but she should have had the personal responsibility to listen to her piercer.", "NTA\n\nPlay stupid games...win stupid prizes\n\nThe fact she is mad at you for pointing out that both you and the piercer warned her does not make you an asshole\n\nShe did this to herself\n\nShe ruined her own honeymoon\n\nAll of this is 100% her fault and nobody should have any sympathy for her at all.

When getting body modifications, there are certain standards set for safe healing and optimal recovery. While it can very a bit from person to person, you would think after thousands of years of poking at each other's bodies, we figured a thing or two out about healing times. Nipple piercings can take a year to heal. It's your friends own fault, and you didn't say anything until she wanted to go complain to the piercer. That's not right of your friend, and you were right to say what you did. It's not like you laughed in her face and said \"haha you deserved the early end of your honeymoon\". But when she wanted to involve people who's fault it wasn't into the mix, you stood up. It's no different than people who get fresh tattoos and go swim and tan and then wonder what's going on.", "NTA\n\nthere are a lot of comments saying the opposite however if she does go back to the person who did the piercing and complains THAT could affect their livelihood.  If she tells people it is the fault of that person THAT could affect their livelihood.  They warned her, you warned her, by all means she can feel upset BUT she should not blame the professional who warned her in the first place (or you who checked as well).", "NTA people shouldn't be so sensitive, she should have listened. Now she needs to suck it up and deal with her mistake.", "NTA. Once she talked about complaining to the piercer then you needed to be fully real with her - it is not their fault, it is her fault. This piercer does not need someone making a fuss in their business (potentially making reviews online) claiming they don\u2019t do their job properly. It\u2019s sympathy until she starts questioning someone\u2019s job.", "So I checked, and the standard warning is that a nipple piercing can take between 9 months and a year to heal.

While no one likes the \u201cI told you so\u201d friend, what really made me totally agree with you, is the fact she wanted to bring grief to the piercer.

Though I'd consider myself kinky, I do not enjoy pain in the bedroom. Do you know how many people didn't understand that biting my nipples was wildly uncomfortable? Imagine nipple clamped between surgical steel and teeth? Not sexy at all. If you're into that stuff, by all means but I don't think mine fully healed for closer to a year. Also, my nipples were actually less sensitive with them. I've not had them for almost a decade and they're far more sensitive now.", "NTA. I would have cut her off at 15 minutes. This is a ridiculous amount of self inflicted drama.", "NTA. If she got her piercings at a reputable shop, they would have given her all the warnings/do's/don'ts and care instructions. This likely would have included a paper copy of said instructions. It's also 2023. She is more than capable of doing a quick google search for herself to how these heal.", "NTA, it seems like she has some things to learn around safety and being risk aware when it comes to kink. Being \u201csympathetic\u201d here would mean what to her? Saying yes, it\u2019s all the piercer\u2019s fault and she had no part in it?

How is her stupidity your fault.", "NTA at all!\n\nI had sex two hours after getting mine pierced with a strict no touchy policy. I\u2019ve had mine for four years now with nary an issue.

Best of luck to you in navigating this person.", "NTA.  \nShe's an idiot. You CLEARLY warned her that pierced nipples need time to heal, you can't create a wound on a sensitive body part and then expect to heavily stress that body part soon afterwards. I'm sure that her piercer would also have explained the risks. But she got carried away with the fantasy about having a new toy to play with. \n\nIf their nipple play was SO severe that she ended up needing medical care and the piercings out, then they absolitely didnt stop at the first signs that something was wrong. They would NEVER have had to cancel their honeymoon if they just left her nipples alone whilst they were healing - their issue is ENTIRELY self inflicted as a result of not listening to warnings. 0 sympathy here as they were warned repeatedly and blew off all warnings. Kinky play is fine, but people need to take responsibility for keeping safe, or people get hurt. She fucked around and she found out. \n\nAbsolutely nothing wrong with you for snapping after she started blaming the professionals that pierced her rather than admitting responsibility for her part in damaging her body by not following instructions despite multiple warnings. She sounds pretty obnoxious, and the worst, most annoying kind of oversharer, NGL. Im guessing this friendship is a one-way-street.  \n\nAs a side note, I've heard of couples giving up sex for weeks or onths before the wedding to spice things up, and it always seems liek the stupidest idea to me.

We've gotten piercings and tattoos in my house, and everyone who got them went in fully aware of the things you can and can not do afterward if you want it to heal successfully. One was a lifeguard, and they had to wait until after the job ended to get theirs. One had plans involving water parks, and they waited on the tattoo. I have summer plans, so I got my newest tattoo in April, so it would be healed before anything where I'd be in the sun or outdoors where it's exposed.
