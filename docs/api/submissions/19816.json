So that will be almost 7 weeks without sex.\n\nAmber then decided, since they were very into nipple play, to get her nipples pierced as a surprise to him. Now, I am not that knowledgeable about piercing, but I know that they take a long time to heal.\n\nSo after a very quick google search, I told her that it will take a lot longer for them to heal than 7 weeks, especially if they are planning to play as hard as they usually do. She dismissed me, said she knew her body better than anyone, that she healed fast... After I tried to convince her once more, she called me a prude. So I dropped it.\n\nThey got married last Saturday, then went on their honeymoon. 4 days in, they are back, she is in the hospital, and the doctor took out the piercings, and banned them from doing anything breast related for 2 months.\n\nThen she spent a whole 4 hours venting to me. At first I tried to comfort her, but then she started talking about going back to the one who did the piercing, and giving them a \"scolding\" for not explaining things to her. I told her that they did their job and warned her, I also warned her, and that the blame is on her, and maybe on her husband (I don't know if he was told how long it would take for them to heal fully).\n\nAnd suddenly I am an AH for not being sympathetic.

WTF. Your friend is stupid. I wouldn't be sympathetic either.   \n\n\n> she said she knew her body better than anyone, that she healed fast\n\nShe must think she's some kind of super hero.", "NTA. You tried to warn her, the piercing people also warned her, but regardless of that, her body is her responsibility. She should have done some research herself too. And it's perfectly okay to have an active sex life, but it shouldn't take priority over her health. And obviously she is now having to deal with the consequences and she just wants somewhere to place the blame. And she vented to you and you listened but if she's throwing blame around when it's obviously her fault, it might have desensitised you to her sadness.", "NTA-  While yes, some people do not need an \"I told you so\", some people really DO.  It sounds to me, from your words, that your friend didn't want emotional support for something unforseen.  She wanted you to validate her anger towards a piercer who did their job, and to validate her poor choices.    \n\n\nSome people need to hear I told you so.  Sucks that it was her honeymoon but she should have had the personal responsibility to listen to her piercer.", "NTA\n\nPlay stupid games...win stupid prizes\n\nThe fact she is mad at you for pointing out that both you and the piercer warned her does not make you an asshole\n\nShe did this to herself\n\nShe ruined her own honeymoon\n\nAll of this is 100% her fault and nobody should have any sympathy for her at all.  Its ok to feel bad it happened, but there is no reason to coddle her.\n\nIt'd be like if you decided to have your wedding outside during the monsoon season in a far away land where monsoon season is pretty much rain for months straight\n\nAgain...play stupid games, win stupid prizes", "NTA. \n\nTruth hurts sometimes.", "NTA. When getting body modifications, there are certain standards set for safe healing and optimal recovery. While it can very a bit from person to person, you would think after thousands of years of poking at each other's bodies, we figured a thing or two out about healing times. Nipple piercings can take a year to heal. It's your friends own fault, and you didn't say anything until she wanted to go complain to the piercer. That's not right of your friend, and you were right to say what you did. It's not like you laughed in her face and said \"haha you deserved the early end of your honeymoon\". But when she wanted to involve people who's fault it wasn't into the mix, you stood up. It's no different than people who get fresh tattoos and go swim and tan and then wonder what's going on.", "NTA\n\nthere are a lot of comments saying the opposite however if she does go back to the person who did the piercing and complains THAT could affect their livelihood.  If she tells people it is the fault of that person THAT could affect their livelihood.  They warned her, you warned her, by all means she can feel upset BUT she should not blame the professional who warned her in the first place (or you who checked as well).", "NTA people shouldn't be so sensitive, she should have listened. Now she needs to suck it up and deal with her mistake.", "NTA. Once she talked about complaining to the piercer then you needed to be fully real with her - it is not their fault, it is her fault. This piercer does not need someone making a fuss in their business (potentially making reviews online) claiming they don\u2019t do their job properly. It\u2019s sympathy until she starts questioning someone\u2019s job.", "So I checked, and the standard warning is that a nipple piercing can take between 9 months and a year to heal. The friend was almost certainly told this by the piercer, but even if they hadn't been then they would have been wildly delusional to think they could heal in 7 weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nSome people may tell you that YTA because of telling the truth. However, what you did is very normal and sensible given that she had vented 4 hours about something that she is 100% wrong about. Who does have patience for that?", "NTA. I cringed reading this, my god. I am terrified at how hard they must have went at them things for her to have to go to the hospital!", "Absolutely NTA. While no one likes the \u201cI told you so\u201d friend, what really made me totally agree with you, is the fact she wanted to bring grief to the piercer. It\u2019s no one but her fault.", "you need better friends... NTA", "Nta-while I maybe sympathize for your friend, she was warned (by piercer and you), and should have heeded said warning.", "Youre NTA! Not your circus,not your monkeys! She brought this on herself.", "NTA.\n\nAs a wise turtle once said: fuck around and find out.", "NTA I had my nipples pierced for 16 years. Though I'd consider myself kinky, I do not enjoy pain in the bedroom. Do you know how many people didn't understand that biting my nipples was wildly uncomfortable? Imagine nipple clamped between surgical steel and teeth? Not sexy at all. If you're into that stuff, by all means but I don't think mine fully healed for closer to a year. Also, my nipples were actually less sensitive with them. I've not had them for almost a decade and they're far more sensitive now.", "NTA. I would have cut her off at 15 minutes. This is a ridiculous amount of self inflicted drama.", "NTA. If she got her piercings at a reputable shop, they would have given her all the warnings/do's/don'ts and care instructions. This likely would have included a paper copy of said instructions. It's also 2023. She is more than capable of doing a quick google search for herself to how these heal.", "NTA, it seems like she has some things to learn around safety and being risk aware when it comes to kink. Being \u201csympathetic\u201d here would mean what to her? Saying yes, it\u2019s all the piercer\u2019s fault and she had no part in it? That just isn\u2019t right.", "Weird that people think being a good friend means validating that friend even when they're an idiot. NTA especially after she wanted to go yell at the piercer because she couldn't follow the after care (which she should know all about if she's actually that into kink lol) instructions", "God being stupid sounds so unnecessarily painful\u2026. NTA by a long shot", "NTA.\n\nIts like warning someone not to stick their hands in a pan of boiling water, only for them to do it anyway and exclaim \"Why did no one warn me!?!?!?!\". \n\nYour friend is a moron.", "She sounds exhausting.", "~~ESH~~ Updated: NTA - wasn't in hospital when speaking to you showing them being okay to discharge at least.\n\nOkay your friend just didnt listen to your advice and is blaming someone else for their mistakes, clear AH move. You unfortunately do not get to be un-sympathetic just because you warned them. Maybe she needed to hear it but certainly not at the point where she was in the hospital. Its a soft YTA big friend TA.", "People are free to do whatever they want to their own bodies.
