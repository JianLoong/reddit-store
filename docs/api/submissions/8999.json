But your sister must not be very observant if she didn't notice the shampoo staining her hands blue before putting it in her hair, so the fact her hair is green now is her own fault. Also, from one blue haired person to another, put the dye in your conditioner, not your shampoo.

It\u2019s none of their business, NTA at all!", "Honestly, you probably won\u2019t need to now. \ud83e\udd23 Good chance your sister got the message!", "You can also put dye in the conditioner! Also hair masks, should help keep your hair color fresh. Do mention it to your family tho lmao", "NTA and I would have thought the dye made the shampoo blue so it's not like there weren't some visual clues \ud83e\udd23", "I appreciate the \"out of the blue\" pun", "Like idk discipline her? Teach her consequences for her actions? Autistic kids need these too, maybe even more than neurotypical ones. Does your mom think that excuse will fly with the cops when she gets caught shop lifting?", "Whoa... Okay your mum needs to shape up, this is not okay! \nJust because she has autism doesn't mean she can get away with stealing things. I think your mum needs therapy and your sister needs more help in understanding things.(spoken by someone with BASS training) \n\nImo, you are not the ahole.", "Can I ask you a couple of questions about your family?\n\n1. Does she know it's wrong to take things that aren't hers? Being autistic isn't really an excuse for bad behaviour. Most autistic people know the difference between right and wrong.\n\n\n2. Do your parents do anything about your sister taking things that don't belong to her? Because it sounds to me like your parents let your sister do whatever she pleases without consequences.\n\nI'm leaning very strongly toward NTA because it sounds to me like your sister is allowed to do whatever she pleases without consequence just because she is autistic, which is just wrong.", "Ah so your mother is happy to raise a nightmare kid that has no friends because her mother didn\u2019t work with her autism. There are many autistic kids out there who learn boundaries and make great friends as a result. It\u2019s tough on the parent yes, but you sign up for that when you have kids.", "Autism is not a \u201csteal things and get away with it\u201d kind of thing. That behavior is indicative of a guardian figure who either doesn\u2019t care to, or can\u2019t, provide adequate care and teachings to a child. Those with this disorder are entirely capable of understanding right from wrong. Your mother needs to shape the f**k up and be a parent.", "Can you lock your door when you are not there?", "Gotta love it when parents excuse autism for destroying your things (which is technically illegal btw)", "Autism is not an excuse. All autist must be really offended by how your mum is treating your sister as if she is too stupid to understand what is allowed and what isn\u2019t.\nThe only AHs around is your parents. \n\nNow, I thought about suggesting you to buy a shampoo for blond hair, but maybe sister would like blue hair instead?", "Do you share a bathroom with your sister?    \nDo you share a bedroom with your sister?", "Also the sister is 12. That\u2019s how she thinks she\u2019s the victim here. She wanted to get away with swiping a bit of her sisters shampoo (small transgression) and she ended up ruining her hair (massive consequence). It takes kids a while to learn, as their brains develop, that sometimes their actions have unforeseen, disproportionate consequences. And that even if it wasn\u2019t their intent, it can still be their fault.", "I believe washing your hair daily is also really hard on it. I wash my hair once a week, and assumed that's what OP does.", "I mean why would they tell you something that means you could pay them less often \ud83e\udd23", "Irrelevant, it\u2019s still not hers to take. Jesus, no wonder there are so many entitled people in this world when no one ever tells them no when they are growing up. 12 is old enough to know better.", "Makes no difference. You don\u2019t take things that belong to others without permission.", "I used to be the same, I had blue hair at 14 and then went through every colour under the sun until I was in my 30s. Then I decided it was too much hard work to keep dyeing my hair, so now it's just my natural dark blonde. Sometimes I miss it, normal is kinda boring. Haha.", "In that case it was clearly no mistake by sis.\n\nNTA for you\n\n>should i have told them about me putting hair dye into my shampoo?\n\nYeah would had been better, since it is family (not roommates) and 12 is not as disciplined as an adult or at least an older teen.", "12 year olds are unpredictable.", "I don't think she is an AH, but I don't think that you were obligated to tell the either, not every situation has a good guy and a bed guy\n\nMaybe she needed a shampoo and imagined that it wasn't a big deal to use yours once, and that would be reasonable, but you added dye to yours because you wanted, which is also reasonable, the only AHs are your parents for blaming you for this", "That makes me sad. \ud83d\ude25", "Your sister is old enough to ask before borrowing things, NTA", "Yeah, got that. She is 12. Adult roommates \"borrow\" or flat-out steal shampoo.", "Multiple shampoo family house get over her using it.", "I don\u2019t know. Thought this was for opinions.", "No. I\u2019m saying that OP knew her sister has a history of using her bathroom products in the past without asking and had a very good idea that she would do the same again. Not saying younger sister didn\u2019t have it coming but nobody can concede OP might have subconsciously wanted her to get caught. All of your older siblings must be saints! lol", "She has selective mutsism,  at home she can scream the whole place down , I think it's gotten past my mum being able to help as now my sister won't listen to her at all", "And I think OP will learn a lesson or two about telling people about stuff you put in bottles without marking them. Is IT ok to simply take stuff without asking? Hell, no. But If I were OP I would try to tell Family that there was no malicious intend. Otherwise this can backfire. I have seen fallout of families for much lesser reasons than ruined long hair that takes months to recover.", "The number of people who think that because they or their kids have a disability means they get a free pass to be AHs is astonishing.", "yeah she knows and no they don't , my parents are overwhelmed they have their own mental issues and cant seem to deal with my sister", "I have got a lock on my door after much arguing with my parents but she finds ways somehow even now", "No to both", "As surprising as this might be, many family households share basic hygiene products. Like shampoo. A twelve-year old is, no doubt, used to having shampoo provided for them without a thought for where it came from.\n\nThis was a simple lack of communication which resulted in a preteen non-catastrophe. Hopefully, lessons learned on all sides.", ">Irrelevant, it\u2019s still not hers to take. Jesus, no wonder there are so many entitled people in this world when no one ever tells them no when they are growing up. 12 is old enough to know better.\n\nJesus, no wonder there are so many entitled people in this world when no one eve taught them to share and share alike.", "That's exactly what you do when you're 12 and have a big sister or brother. Doesn't make OP TA for putting dye in her shampoo but all this nonsense calling the little sister a thief and saying she should be punished is pathetic", "Oddly enough like a greenish blue has become my normal, obviously it requires up keep but it's what I've stuck with for almost 2 years now", "Yeah I've realised that, definitely not making that mistake again", "eh im 21 and she has a kid high on the spectrum and a 16 year old who wont take his adhd meds, i get that what happened during my day isnt gonna come up much", "Oh she steals on purpose", "That doesn't make it OP's fault though? Don't steal people's stuff.", "But they shouldn't, and that make OP NTA", "I agree I should of told them honestly idk why I didn't", "You appear to be lost.", "And in this fictional scenario OP chose to go for the shampoo and not one of the things their sister is already known to consistently steal? If this was a crazy subconscious revenge scheme, it was a bad one \ud83d\ude02", "Why should anyone have to tell people what they do with their own things? Don't take people's stuff without asking and that kind of thing won't happen \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Definitely not OP's job to tell others about what she's putting into her own belongings. Bet she's not telling them about what undies she's buying/using \ud83e\udd23", "I'm sorry to hear that your parents are overwhelmed, but it sounds like a case of them putting themselves in this situation by allowing your sister to run wild and let her do whatever she pleases. \n\nI confirm the opinion I was leaning toward in the first place.\n\nNTA.\n\nI hope your parents can get some assistance in getting their household under control. I saw in a comment further down that your brother is ADHD and is not medication complaint. \n\nHaving two ND kids is a lot, and I'm speaking from personal experience. I'm autistic myself, and I probably have ADD. \n\nI suggest you keep your expensive or altered products in a locked cabinet to protect yourself from your pilfering sister. \n\nGood luck to you.", "She took it and used it in another shower, it\u2019s not like she happened to be in the shower and just used what was conveniently at hand. She\u2019s helped herself to someone else\u2019s belongings without bothering to ask. There a thing called courtesy, it should be shown, even amongst family members.", "Nope. The 12 year old went into a different bathroom, took shampoo that they *knew* wasn't theirs and took it back to use in another bathroom. \n\nThat's not \"no thought for where it came from\"", "Sharing means asking permission before taking. Taking without permission is stealing.", "We don\u2019t all have to share everything & even if the other person is prepared to share, you still should have the courtesy to ask, not just help yourself to,other people\u2019s belongings.", "This is a wild concept so buckle down. \n\n\u201cSharing\u201d requires two active participants. OP\u2019s sister should ask if she wants to \u201cshare\u201d the shampoo, and OP could then have told her that there was dye in it. \n\nInstead, she took it without asking, and she faced a consequence from doing that that is *not* OP\u2019s fault or responsibility.", "Being entitled goes both ways.

Probably better for your (and their) mental health if you move out asap.", "Didn't say it was a fault.", "Oh I'm also nd so it's a circus in here lol", "Bro it's shampoo.", "Exactly not really the first thing that comes up , will be now tho", "Your confusing everyone because you put yta, unless you think op is in the wrong, but it seems like you don\u2019t think they\u2019re in the wrong", "I feel your pain, just from the other side of the fence LOL", "i'm also nd (adhd, looking into an autism dx), and if anyone so much as lays a finger on my stuff i freak out. but even as a kid, i never took other people's stuff. i was taught that there would be consequences and people would be mad at me, so i concluded that their stuff was theirs and mine was mine. \n\nyour sister *really* has to be taught that there are consequences to doing stuff like that, because she can't grow up and go out into the world with that mindset and believing she can get away with everything because she's autistic.", "Shampoo can be expensive depending on the brand and you don't know what was done with it like op and her blue hair dye shampoo unless it's communal property which it wasn't as sister had to seek it out. If it is acknowledged to be something to share that's different, but like specifically labeled food it is not wise", "And I repeat, irrelevant, still wasn\u2019t hers to take. I don\u2019t get why this is so hard for people to understand. Do you all just wander around helping yourself to whatever you want without asking permission? Are you all thieves who are somehow justifying your own behaviour?", "On the bright side, 12 is old enough for blue hair, right? I\u2019m guessing the only problem is cosmetic. It\u2019s an easy fix and not a great tragedy  for a 12 year old to have a bad hair day.", "I do think OP is TA for putting it on a 12-year-old kid.

Idc how you feel, but ok", "Being upset at the 12 yo sister."]}
