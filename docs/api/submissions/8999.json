There was a definite element of sunk-cost fallacy in my confusion--we'd been together 4 years, we were engaged, I had already bought the dress/booked the church/ordered the flowers, etc. Plus, having grown up with an asshole, rage-a-holic, bible-thumping stepfather, I had a faulty understanding of the difference between Christian forgiveness and tolerating abuse. After his VERY public temper tantrum at the museum left both me AND his mother humiliated and in tears, I fled to a less-public alcove to cry. His mom followed me. She put her arm around me and said, \"I hope you know that just because you have a ring on your finger, you don't have to marry him.\" HIS MOTHER. SAID THAT. TO ME. Of course I took it as the sign from God I'd been looking for. I didn't immediately break up with him, but that was the point of no return for me.

I went to open the bottle and it was 90% gone!  The friend had decided he liked the Dreft far more than the Tide (not exactly cheap either).  He was raving how great Dreft was.
