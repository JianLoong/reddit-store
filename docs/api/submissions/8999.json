But your sister must not be very observant if she didn't notice the shampoo staining her hands blue before putting it in her hair, so the fact her hair is green now is her own fault. Also, from one blue haired person to another, put the dye in your conditioner, not your shampoo. You let conditioner sit in your hair for a little bit anyway so it'll pick up more pigment than it would with the shampoo.", "NTA but this is hilarious", "NTA It's your shampoo, kept in a shower only you use, and while she has stolen other things she hadn't taken your shampoo before.
