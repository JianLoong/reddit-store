WTH kind of family is this?! Call Australia's version of CPS with whatever evidence or story you have regarding her treatment of her daughter, then start making plans to get your own daughters away from that toxic family. I'm so very sorry for your loss. Good luck, OP. NTA, but you have to protect your own daughters from this venom.", "If your niece is truly being abused, Australia must have official channels to pursue investigation into that. What you're doing isn't helpful to anybody, not even your niece. While she might appreciate you sticking up for her, she might also be bearing the brunt of punishment for your actions. You never know what happens behind closed doors, and her safety should be your primary and only concern. \n\nNTA for caring about your niece, but it sounds like you're letting your grief get in the way - you're angry at your SIL, on behalf of your wife. That's not wrong, but it's not productive, and it could be causing more harm than good.", "She said your wife **deserves to die**?\n\nThat\u2019s one of those pause, ask them to stop repeat\u2026 then stop interacting style things.\n\nSo no don\u2019t \u201cwar\u201d but\u2026 cut them off. \n\n#Forever.", "NTA.  This isn\u2019t even a contest.  Your SIL thinks your late wife \u201cdeserved to die\u201d of kidney failure\u2026and apparently thinks abusing her own child is justified.  She sounds vile.  The question is why is anyone else in the family even considering taking her side?", "NTA - The way you reacted was totally justified considering what she said and what she\u2019s doing. You\u2019re blameless for that.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. You can\u2019t continue to respond in this way to her. When a child is in an abusive situation, you need to be their advocate as much as possible. That\u2019s hard to do if your arguing drives the parent to isolate the child away from you. She may even take her anger at you out on the child.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair. Your fury is righteous. But the child may get caught in the crossfire.\n\nDo as much as you can to stay in the child\u2019s life. Part of that might be biting your tongue, and not giving this woman the tongue-lashing she deserves. Please reach out to some support groups to help you navigate this while head-deep in your grief. Gather evidence, keep records, and do all you can to get your niece out of there.", "NTA. She told you that your wife, her sister, deserved to die. I mean, holy shit. I hope you're telling the family members what she said.", "NTA your wife did NOT deserve to die. Carry on, sir.", "NTA.  Particular-try has some good points.   Being gentle is a far better tool for you.  Take the time to gather evidence. Pics, recordings, text messages saved and screen shot.  Be ready to provide such evidence should there ever be a need.  You can keep tabs on the situation if you can manage to tolerate these people some, enough to check on the child and gather evidence.  She will see your kindness and know you will be a safe place for her should she need it. Her knowing that you care and are kind will be a great strength for her.", "NTA. You stuck up for your daughter and your wife. Continue to be their champions. Block your SIL until she can behave like an adult", "Just go no contact. No one is winning here.", "She said your wife deserved to die. How ANYTHING YOU DID compare to that? \n\nNTA", "Block your SIL. I know you wish to win the war, but I doubt this war can ever be won by you. I cannot see you being awarded custody of your SIL's daughter, and slagging words at each other will never change that outcome.", "NTA but does your wife\u2019s family know what SIL said about her dying? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she left that part out and just said you called her a horrible Mother.", "NTA - im Australian and we take allegations of child abuse very seriously,  id do what I can to report it to the local police. They dont .uch around with child abuse, they'll look into it for you.\n\nSorry she said what she did about your wife.", "NTA, but this is not a war, this is protecting a child and the entire family should be on that train. If they aren't, then they are accessories to the abuse of a child. You have a reason for being hateful to her - she's a child abuser. If they are going to protect a child abuser they don't get to be around YOUR kids either, BTW.", "NTA. I would consider moving back to your country and cut contact with them all, after you tell them what your SIL said about your wife.", "NTA it\u2019s not about your wife, it\u2019s about your niece.", "YTA.   \nStop warring. How are you better than your wife\u2019s sister at this point if you are abusive too? \n\n  \nKeep being nasty and you are going to fail in your wife\u2019s wishes. She wants to give that niece a better life? Then how does fighting aggressively with her sister achieve that?   \nRead Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War and build an intentional plan. Revenge served cold, best offence is a good defence. All that good stuff.   \nTell your family your family you are sorry and it was temporary insanity that you were struck so deeply with grief, ask them to help you be a better person.   \nThen slowly plot your revenge. Make your revenge all about being a shiny, amazing light in a world of darkness, where you are the safe, kind, stable, and gentle haven all these traumatised children can be secure. It will take a year or two\u2026. To establish this safe haven, and you will be a better person for it too.   \nEveryone wins.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your SIL said something unforgivable. I would cut her off, block her, and have no contact at all with her. And you can tell her family that their support of her means they agree that your wife deserved to die. Also, I'm so very sorry for your loss. Please take a step back and take time to grieve without this ugly drama. I can't imagine how difficult this must be. NTA", "I am sorry for your loss, and NTA. It's time to bring out the nuclear options: get the police and social services involved. I understand why your wife may not have felt like she could afford to burn bridges with her family, but you aren't bound by those ties, so you can do what she could not.", "NTAH it sounds like the niece needs a hero. Be that.", "Hey you are 33 or 20?\nYou forget to change your profile lol", "Nta", "Let it go bro, from what you've said that family is a mess and probably not a great influence on your kids. Is moving to your home country an option? Do you have family there who would be a better influence on your kids? I get that you want to fulfill your wife's mission, but your kids are number 1.  YWBTA if you continue.", "3 months ago you were a 20NB, so which is it??", "Sorry, but I think you may have over stepped here.   SIL also overstepped.  This could have been handled more tactfully,  but I trust your heart is in the right place.  The issue that should be at the forefront of your thoughts is to get the niece the help she needs, even if that might not be with you.  That would have been true wether your wife had passed or not.  You do not specify what kind of abuse.  Where is Children's Aid in this?  Where is the niece's father and his family?  You should not be at war, and maybe your late wife should not have been either.  You should be on a peace mission.  That niece needs adults around her that are calm and safe.  She needs you to be a resource not another source of emotional distress.  I hope you are still able to help her.", "Did you miss the part with the SIL said her sister deserved to die?", "That doesn't invalidate what is good, sound advice.\n\nBlowing up and yelling solves nothing. Methodical steps to get the niece out of her situation is better. And sometimes you have to overlook someone's volatile words to achieve the greater objective."]}
