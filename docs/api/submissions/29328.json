WTH kind of family is this?! Call Australia's version of CPS with whatever evidence or story you have regarding her treatment of her daughter, then start making plans to get your own daughters away from that toxic family. I'm so very sorry for your loss. Good luck, OP. NTA, but you have to protect your own daughters from this venom.", "If your niece is truly being abused, Australia must have official channels to pursue investigation into that. What you're doing isn't helpful to anybody, not even your niece. While she might appreciate you sticking up for her, she might also be bearing the brunt of punishment for your actions. You never know what happens behind closed doors, and her safety should be your primary and only concern. \n\nNTA for caring about your niece, but it sounds like you're letting your grief get in the way - you're angry at your SIL, on behalf of your wife. That's not wrong, but it's not productive, and it could be causing more harm than good.", "She said your wife **deserves to die**?\n\nThat\u2019s one of those pause, ask them to stop repeat\u2026 then stop interacting style things.\n\nSo no don\u2019t \u201cwar\u201d but\u2026 cut them off. \n\n#Forever.", "NTA.  This isn\u2019t even a contest.  Your SIL thinks your late wife \u201cdeserved to die\u201d of kidney failure\u2026and apparently thinks abusing her own child is justified.  She sounds vile.  The question is why is anyone else in the family even considering taking her side?", "NTA - The way you reacted was totally justified considering what she said and what she\u2019s doing. You\u2019re blameless for that.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. You can\u2019t continue to respond in this way to her. When a child is in an abusive situation, you need to be their advocate as much as possible. That\u2019s hard to do if your arguing drives the parent to isolate the child away from you. She may even take her anger at you out on the child.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair. Your fury is righteous. But the child may get caught in the crossfire.\n\nDo as much as you can to stay in the child\u2019s life. Part of that might be biting your tongue, and not giving this woman the tongue-lashing she deserves. Please reach out to some support groups to help you navigate this while head-deep in your grief.

I hope you're telling the family members what she said.", "NTA your wife did NOT deserve to die. Carry on, sir.", "NTA.  Particular-try has some good points.   Being gentle is a far better tool for you.  Take the time to gather evidence. Pics, recordings, text messages saved and screen shot.  Be ready to provide such evidence should there ever be a need.  You can keep tabs on the situation if you can manage to tolerate these people some, enough to check on the child and gather evidence.  She will see your kindness and know you will be a safe place for her should she need it. Her knowing that you care and are kind will be a great strength for her.", "NTA. You stuck up for your daughter and your wife. Continue to be their champions. Block your SIL until she can behave like an adult", "Just go no contact. No one is winning here.", "She said your wife deserved to die. How ANYTHING YOU DID compare to that? \n\nNTA", "Block your SIL.

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she left that part out and just said you called her a horrible Mother.", "NTA - im Australian and we take allegations of child abuse very seriously,  id do what I can to report it to the local police. They dont .uch around with child abuse, they'll look into it for you.\n\nSorry she said what she did about your wife.", "NTA, but this is not a war, this is protecting a child and the entire family should be on that train. If they aren't, then they are accessories to the abuse of a child. You have a reason for being hateful to her - she's a child abuser. If they are going to protect a child abuser they don't get to be around YOUR kids either, BTW.", "NTA.

How are you better than your wife\u2019s sister at this point if you are abusive too? \n\n  \nKeep being nasty and you are going to fail in your wife\u2019s wishes. She wants to give that niece a better life? Then how does fighting aggressively with her sister achieve that?   \nRead Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War and build an intentional plan. Revenge served cold, best offence is a good defence. All that good stuff.   \nTell your family your family you are sorry and it was temporary insanity that you were struck so deeply with grief, ask them to help you be a better person.   \nThen slowly plot your revenge. Make your revenge all about being a shiny, amazing light in a world of darkness, where you are the safe, kind, stable, and gentle haven all these traumatised children can be secure. It will take a year or two\u2026. To establish this safe haven, and you will be a better person for it too.   \nEveryone wins.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This could have been handled more tactfully,  but I trust your heart is in the right place.  The issue that should be at the forefront of your thoughts is to get the niece the help she needs, even if that might not be with you.  That would have been true wether your wife had passed or not.  You do not specify what kind of abuse.  Where is Children's Aid in this?  Where is the niece's father and his family?  You should not be at war, and maybe your late wife should not have been either.  You should be on a peace mission.  That niece needs adults around her that are calm and safe.  She needs you to be a resource not another source of emotional distress.

Made it really hard to read. \n\nSil sounds like a monster. However I think you\u2019re losing sight of the bigger picture. Your main concern is her abusing her daughter (valid).

What are you solving here exactly? \n\nDocument and send it off to child services, or the police and let those organisations do their job. \n\nI\u2019m sensing you are a very poor communicator because there\u2019s no way her family would be calling you TA here if they knew what was going on. As I said you\u2019re putting all your energy into calling her names instead of ignoring her, telling her family what\u2019s going on so they can help (unclear why they can\u2019t see it tbh if it\u2019s apparent to you guys after only a  short time), and contacting the relevant authorities. \n\nTake a minute and consider what I\u2019ve said. Your intent is to save a girl from being abused. But instead of doing anything useful about it you\u2019re being rude to her mother (although she deserves it).
