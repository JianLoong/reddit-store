If this is atypical behavior for both of you, then I vote NAH. If the bickering is chronic, maybe ESH. Good luck. Teething sucks. But remember it's only temporary. Good luck", "A discussion is needed as to why this particular thing was the final straw, because it's been building.\n\nYou've explained why his actions were your last straw, and it's perfectly understandable.", "ESH. Please learn to talk calmly with each other so you aren't raising your child in an environment where the adults communicate by yelling, and so you aren't teaching her to yell when she's frustrated. She's going to end up forever in trouble in school, and afraid at home if you all can't get your act together.", "NTA, you set it aside to freaking eat. You can't be on 24/7. 15-30 minutes is the basic for eating, wet towels won't build anything deadly in those few moments. Your dude needs to get control of himself, and maybe you should look closer at the distribution of work in your household. It sounds like you need a leg up and can't find a spot to stand, your partner should help lift you up, not drag you down just because they are floundering or don't agree with procedures. Either he helps in the moment; or he talks it out later once everything has settled a bit.\n\n\nYou don't deserve to be yelled at.", "ESH - Your husband's reaction was super unnecessary so he's an AH. You're not necessarily the AH for snapping in your reaction but YTA for doubling down and telling him he can do everything from here on out.   \nYou're both the AH for trying to continuously blame each other after this incident instead of trying to move towards mutual understanding of why you both did what you did. Both sides are understandable bc you're both stressed, so this could have been an opportunity to come closer together through a little compassion and understanding, but instead you're here trying to get a declaration for which party to pin it on.", "NTA. You\u2019re exhausted. Sounds like he may be as well. Maybe you could both give one another some \u201cme time\u201d soon so that you each get a break.", "ESH. \n\nStop yelling at each other. It doesn't really help anything and gets everyone in a bad mood. Having a young child is stressful at the best of times without having your partner at your throat for minor things too. \n\nIn your shoes I would apologise and have a heart to heart about how stressful things are - he's surely feeling it too. See if you can divide the labour any more effectively. Or just commiserate a bit together and hope the more difficult parts of parenthood pass quickly. \n\nThis doesn't need to be a big thing.", "NTA. If he had that much of a problem, he could have taken them down. Some wet towels on the floor for the time it took you to eat and take a moment to breathe isn\u2019t going to cause the house to fall apart. You had zero intention of leaving them there for the rest of the month and clearly have already spent a good work day watching a child while also maintaining a household. \n\nLike it\u2019s water, it\u2019ll evaporate. It\u2019s not as though it\u2019s soda and would leave a sticky mess.", "NTA. Why does it seem like you're the only one taking care of your daughter and cleaning the house when it's supposed to be a shared responsibility between parties? Your husband seems to be TA here and deserves some yelling at. Okay but I guess the better way of communication would be to have a chat with him and let him know you're exhausted from doing everything by yourself and that he should play his part as a parent and an owner of the house.", "NTA. What the hell is his problem?", "ESH you both need to have  serious discussion about the unequal division of labor before this gets worse. You absolutely deserve 15mins to eat.", "NTA\nYou are home with the baby all day, your husband needs to learn some respect. If he doesn\u2019t like the way you clean, then he\u2019s more than welcome to do it himself.", "Info:  Do you stay at home all day with the kid while he works?  Is he the main breadwinner?  Was this an agreed upon thing before and you just didn't like it today?\n\nIt seems like you kind of got a bit angry over a pretty minor thing.  Throwing wet towels in a corner isn't something that most people tend to like.  I don't know that putting a towel in a hamper is \"adulting\".   Barring some pretty other damning information, I'd say YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would advise not to be too right cause it pushes people away. That goes for both.", "No a$$holes here.It sounds like both of you were exhausted and he maybe didn\u2019t mean to say that.You should probably apologise to each other.", "This would be the second time in 2 weeks we\u2019ve bickered about things being left around, this isn\u2019t us tho, we hardly argue and hardly fight, and we\u2019ve been married and living together for a year now\n\nTeething does suck and I feel for my little girl, the pain she\u2019s in breaks my heart", "Usually we don\u2019t yell at each other or get angry at each other, we hardly argue and when we do we separate ourselves before it escalates\u2026 today is the second time we\u2019ve escalated like that and it\u2019s not like us at all\u2026 I\u2019m not too sure of the stress is just getting to us or if I\u2019m just allowing my emotions of the day flood out in the wrong way", "I\u2019m actually here because this is the 2nd time we\u2019ve bickered and we hardly ever argue or fight, this isn\u2019t like me and my husband, we\u2019re usually so happy, loving and understanding towards each other. I\u2019m only here to just get other\u2019s opinion and see if I was out of line and should have done it differently.\n\nI instantly regretted yelling and lashing out, I don\u2019t want some small minor thing come between my husband and I", "I have already apologized and we hugged and kissed, I\u2019m still a bit frustrated tho and I can see he is too. We\u2019ve been dealing with a lot lately, his ex wife being the root of our problems and me starting a new job next week\n\nI\u2019m hoping the difficult parts pass soon, we\u2019re both madly inlove with each other and love our daughter to death, last thing I want is a minor thing to come between us", "Well then neither of you are AHs. Just parents trying to acclimate to a baby and your new, constantly changing, normal.", "Fair! And I read some of your other comment responses so I'd backpedal much of my og response then, NAH - your husband's ex is a stressor, and you starting a new job is a major transition. Transitions and stressors can inflate any tension, and everyone's window of tolerance shrinks during these times. I'm sure with a little talking you and your partner can lay out how you're feeling in general, independent of this situation, and you'll probably both be able to extend a little more grace to one another in these moments", "Have you told him that you can\u2019t get time to yourself to eat or use the toilet or shower? I would make clear to him that those small times are \u201cprotected\u201d except in case of emergency. You may need to tell your husband your needs explicitly. If that\u2019s not working, get a counselor. Or have him take over the childcare for a weekend - I\u2019m sure that would help his appreciation for what you do", "NTA.  Do you have any family that can help you?  My mom was just amazing and helped keep me sane.  She stopped by so I could take a nap, cleaned without judgement and was my sounding board.  You and hubs are on edge, and need a night out.", "It sounds like you are both going through a tremendous amount at the moment, it's no wonder tempers are fraying. I'm glad you've made up - maybe make a conscious effort to treat him to something in the next few days if some resentment lingers - it needn't be anything big just something meaningful. Other than that, I wish you the best - your relationship will surely be stronger for weathering these harder times."]}
