I have a 75lb dog that is generally pretty friendly although I do understand that he looks quite intimidating. All of my friends are very dog friendly and I didn't anticipate there being any issues.\n\nThe issue arose when they invited along a couple of their friends, one of which was deathly terrified of dogs. My friends did not tell me in advance about this and once they arrived, they expected me to crate my dog for the duration of their stay. I did attempt to do this, but my dog was crying for 15 min because he could hear all the people outside and I honestly couldn't bear to torture him like that. So I pretty much resorted to keeping him as far away from the person that was scared of him as possible as a sort of compromise. As a result of this though my friends guilt tripped me the whole time saying that I was not taking into account her feelings, which I got upset about since I felt that it was a bit unfair for them to expect me to sacrifice my dog's wellbeing for someone I don't know and they didn't give me any heads up about.\n\nEvery time the dog came within her eye line, she started freaking out, which obviously could be a result of some trauma, but I honestly see my dog as my family and I couldn't really deal with hearing him wail for hours on end, ESPECIALLY since they hadn't told me this individual was coming so that I could have made the necessary arrangements for him (doggy day care, etc. ). So AITA?  \n\n\nEdit: I guess for additional context, I did tell my friend at the time that I felt she was overreacting since the girl was freaking out even when my dog wasn't even close to her, and they got extremely upset at me over that. In retrospect, I was just frustrated and I did apologize for that statement, but that might also have played into why my friends are guilting me really hard about this", "created_utc": 1678163889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kp9yd/aita_for_getting_frustrated_that_my_friends/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
