I did attempt to do this, but my dog was crying for 15 min because he could hear all the people outside and I honestly couldn't bear to torture him like that.

So AITA?  \n\n\nEdit: I guess for additional context, I did tell my friend at the time that I felt she was overreacting since the girl was freaking out even when my dog wasn't even close to her, and they got extremely upset at me over that.

When we walked in the house, I saw my mother after a suicide attempt, sitting on her own vomit in the bathroom floor, still dripping out of her mouth. \n\nPTSD literally changes your brain structure. I'm not saying she had a formative experience like that, but actual phobias are a medical condition. People aren't doing it to be cute or to get attention (when it's legit). It's not childish to have your brain literally rewired after a traumatic event. \n\nHow you act around that phobia makes all the difference. The uninvited guest should have realized that, even if they are \"unfounded\", her triggers were her responsibility. It's.not the fact that she had a phobia that's childish, it's that she as a grown adult expected other people to unnecessarily cater to her.", "If you want to be pedantic: you is 2nd person PLURAL too, so 'you/yours' refer to  \"both of you: op and your dog\", by using 'his' it looks like the dog own the house and op is paying rent to his dog or something", "I\u2019m normally a \u201cpeople over animals\u201d person, but this situation is absurd.\n\nWhy were the girl\u2019s feelings of discomfort more important than your feelings of discomfort over your dog crying?\n\nNTA\n\nI\u2019m not a big dog person (mostly because I\u2019m allergic) but if I go to someone\u2019s house where there\u2019s a dog, it\u2019s \ud83d\udcaf my responsibility to take medication first. I don\u2019t expect the owner\u2019s to lock their dog up.\n\nIf someone has a fear of a specific animal, they shouldn\u2019t go to that animal\u2019s home.", "Bro...do you really think those are comparable???? Thats trauma im talking about shit like this, dogs, swimming, certain foods. That sounds like a horrible experience.", "I do think they are comparable. We don't know why this person was afraid of dogs. Maybe they were attacked or witnessed a dog attack as a child. Who knows. Dogs can kill you, swimming can kill you, if you're allergic certain foods can kill you, and plenty of foods can kill you if not prepared or stored correctly.\n\nmy point is, phobias can be out of the sufferer's control. the process for being in the presence of a phobia trigger as a physically healthy adult *should* be, ask if it can be removed, and if not, remove yourself. and, preferably, be in some kind of therapy or treatment if it's life alteringly bad. people are not childish for having phobias, they are childish for how they treat other people because of it."]}
