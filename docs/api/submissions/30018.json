Hubs need to suck it up.  He can gag for a few minutes to clean up the litter box.  If it's unmanageable, invest in the automatic cleaning boxes.  He pulled a switch up on you.", "I had the same problem for a while, that made me extremely uncomfortable because the gag reflux lasted for almost an hour after scooping the litter box and sometimes I really had to run for the bathroom right after dinner. My SO just laughed at me first and then she took over, same happened when we had kids, she was taking care of diapers and I had to put earplugs up my nostrils to clean the litter box occasionally. Then  covid cabe and my sense of smell just paused for 3 months, now I am feeling better and it doesn't bother me anymore, whoever sees it first is on clean duty and basically we love our cat too much to argue about it.", "I'd be annoyed too but I get it. If it's the smell that bothers him, he can rub some Vicks vapo rub under his nose and even put a mask on. I've used this trick in vet med tons!  Also elevating the box if you can so he's not  bending over to scoop may help as well. Good luck!", "NTA try a self cleaning litter box and don't take that \"\"deal\"\". If he's the only one feeding them he will get ALL of the love while you deal with all the literal shit.", "Get him a good respirator, like what you would use during construction. Seriously. Not a mask, a respirator. He's going to need it if you ever have children.", "I think he should just keep cleaning the cat box until he builds up a tolerance. What happens if you two have none furry babies together? Does he expect you to be the only one to handle diapers? Runny noses or throw up?", "Your husband Jack needs to clean the litter box, gag reflex or no. If it's the smell, he can get noseplugs. If it is anything else, he can suck it up because he should have thought of this before bringing animals into the house.  \nHe absolutely tricked you and you have every right to be pissed about it.  \nNTA", "NTA. Your husband is behaving like a dramatic child, but as an entire ass man. This is a form of weaponized incompetence. Offer him something to retch in and get some nice noise canceling headphones for yourself so you don\u2019t have to listen to the purgation demonstration.", "NTA\n\nI have a really bad gag reflex too and sometimes cleaning up after my dog is awful. But I still do it! \n\nMaybe get him to try different ways of dealing with it. I found having a pair of gloves on helped a bit and holding my breath slightly.", "HE needs to pay for self-scooping litter boxes.  This is a lousy agreement which he isn't even keeping(in him feeding them).\n\nAnd he can wear masks or something if it's a scent thing.  Plus honestly this is what?  A month.  Tough, he can keep at it until he gets over it.  And if he doesn't well again tough, he made the choice of not one but two kittens.\n\nYou do realize, when/if you have kids, Diaper duty, potty training everything will be on you, because of his poor gag reflex.  \n\nNTA because sometimes you just have to work thru adversity to fulfill your responsibilities and hubby isn't doing that and shows that he will always skate out of his responsibilities.", "my husband has the same issue\u2026 coughing from the dust and ammonia triggers his gag reflex so he wears a N95 mask. problem solved", "NTA, he should get used to it if he wants to have cats.", "NTA, give up the cats. He can\u2019t hold his end of the agreement and instead of SHARING responsibilities for 1 cat, because of him you have 100% responsibilities for 2 cats\n\nFeeding the cats is like 1% of the work, that\u2019s nothing.", "You need a partner, not a baby.\n\nHow will he handle diapers and baby puke?  Oh.....YOU will have to. \n\nTell him to man up, get therapy,  grow a pair....or be ready to have an additional cry baby for life.", "I feel for you. We have a lot of pets (which is on both of us) but my partner really really struggles with cleaning up poop and pee. I knew this going in and that I always be the main cleaner for the animals, but ya know... wish it was different! Sounds like you've got some division of labor going but scooping is much more intensive and gross than feeding, so maybe you can trade some other house chores to make it feel more equitable? This is morbid but we have a division of labor where I deal with bodily fluids and my partner deals with dead things (which ick me out SO MUCH more and not them for some reason). In the spring when the poor baby birds in the eaves are doing swan dives onto the pavement this really pays off for me. \n\nWe also invested in a litter robot. It was NOT cheap but also now I only have to handle litter about once a week when it fills. I just grab the bag from the bottom compartment, toss it in the outside garbage, and put in a new back. Once a month I scrub it out fully. SO MUCH BETTER. If you can afford to solve this problem with technology I highly recommend it! \n\nLastly, try getting him to wear an N95 mask while cleaning the litter box. It really cuts down on smell so if that's his trigger it should help. Good luck and obviously NTA.", "He doesn't have as much experience gagging as you.", "Expensive\n\nI have one and it's awesome but only one of my two cats will use it too", "I love our robot litter box. It just runs a fork through the litter and scoops the clumps into a reservoir at the end that has a lid and a charcoal filter. Nevertheless my husband took over cleaning and changing litter when I was pregnant and we just kinda never went back to even stevens bc according to him \u201cYour responsibilities didn\u2019t go back to \u2018normal\u2019 so why should mine?\u201d", "**if", "Sometimes it\u2019s not the odor. I have a similarly horrible gag reflex. Just looking at puke or poop is enough to make me puke.", "It takes 30 seconds to feed the cats and most of the time husband isn\u2019t even doing it", "She\u2019s not upset at his medical condition, she\u2019s upset he begged her to get 2 cats and doesn\u2019t even hold up his end of the deal", "No, she's upset that he specifically said he would be able to take on an equal amount of litter box scooping because 2 cats was HIS idea. He made this decision and commitment, he did the convincing, and it's his job to know his limits.", "My sister has one, she ranks it higher than the previous reigning champion, dishwasher, in the order of household appliances.", "To be \ud83d\udcaf here my cat uses Her box once every few months and that's normally in the winter. She's like a dog when she gotta go she asks to be let out no matter behat time of night \ud83d\ude2d", "Petsafe has some for under $200", "It\u2019s possible that they aren\u2019t planning to have kids.  My husband does not do well with cleaning up after dogs or cats either.  Poop is just the most disgusting thing in the role to him (he is also a combat veteran and has picked up blown apart body parts with no issues - it\u2019s just poop that he can\u2019t handle lol).  \n\nWe are also childfree. So no dirty diapers to deal with, ever.  I do all of the animal clean up and does the mowing and most of the cooking.  It takes me less than 2 minutes each evening to clean our 4 litter boxes.", "Since they are shelter cats, can she know they never had it?", "There's are some now that monitor their waste to see if there are problems, actually.  It was one of the main reasons I was thinking about it as one of mine tends to have urinary tract infections, so I always have to keep a careful eye.", "Wait you had a 23 year old cat?", "I have this and love it. I leave the box for a week, can check on if they're peeing (color change), then seal it up and trash it and put down a new one. So great.", "Which one does she have?", "OPs husband is too lazy to find a solution because for him the easiest solution is just forcing his wife to do it", "Either way, gloves and/or hand washing will prevent it.", "1. Most solely indoor cats never get it because they don\u2019t eat things that carry it.\n\n2. If the cats were outdoor at any point, they probably already contracted it and have recovered, and it\u2019s usually only shed in feces right after the first time they contract it.", "Yeah I don't use the throw away refills. It felt really wasteful. We're bought the hard plastic tray and clean/refill it. With this litter box though were able to go a week or so without cleaning. \n\nTo be fair, we also have an additional regular litter box because one of the cats won't use the auto one.", "I need to send that to my sibling chat."]}
