Hold his breath? I f-ing HATE scooping the litter, but fair is fair and I will do my share.

Gagging over scooping hard clumps out of the litter box is a bit much.\n\nIf you're scooping twice a day, you should get a bigger litter box, or a second litter box.

Its not like you can control them like you can control what clothes you wear. Its a reflex bc its automatic. Y'all are being silly.
