A month ago his roommate moved out and my bf asked me to move in, I initially said yes but now that it is time for me to move I no longer wish to do so due to the condition of the property and the landlord.\n\nThe property: it is a 3 bedroom house with a small yard, it is $1300/month all utilities included. Several rooms in the home have ceiling tiles falling down, there's clearly some damage to the flooring as there are \"weak spots\" and it is uneven, wood paneling is peeling off the walls, there are big holes in the drywall and drafty windows, and the house was filled with clutter from the previous owner (an old woman that died). I went to move a few kitchen items in this past Tuesday and realized the the food in the cupboards has been there since the owner of the home passed away, and now the cupboards are filled with rat shit from rats that have been feasting on the food this entire time. I cleaned the entire kitchen to the best of my ability, but it is still in really rough condition. These are not all of the issues with the home, just ones I am listing to give you some examples.\n\nThe landlord: he is the grandson of the original owner of the home and bought the property for $40k when she died in 2019, after speaking with him he explained to me that since buying the home he simply does not have the time nor interest to put in work to make the necessary repairs, and that the house is \"livable\". He then went on to say how his cousin used to rent there with my bf and he got tired of his cousin \"bitching\" to him about repairs that need done so he asked him to move out. He left, my bf got a new roommate, and now the new roommate has moved out as well but without giving the landlord much notice so he is requesting I give him a non refundable \"deposit\". On top of all of this he is an under the table landlord and only accepts cash and does not have a lease for me to sign.\n\nI no longer feel comfortable moving into the house, this has absolutely nothing to do with my bf and everything to do with the condition of the home and the lazy landlord. I intend to pay the landlord for March and April rent to cover my bf and give him time to find a roommate, but he is expecting me to move in this week. AITA for telling him that I do not want to move in because of these reasons?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: To clarify, due to my bfs line of work he is laid off during the winter months so he will not be back to work until mid march, and before he can save to move he intends to save up to buy a car so he is unable to afford to move to a different place with me at this time.", "created_utc": 1677349540, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11brv8r/aita_for_changing_my_mind_about_moving_in/", "score": 278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

DO NOT move into that dilapidated shithole. DO NOT pay that landlord a dime. Be brutally frank with your BF as to why. If he continues to hang out in that mess that's his decision.

Even if you love your boyfriend and even if he is a really sweet guy, he seems to be at peace with living in below the poverty line circumstances under the thumb of a lazy and exploitative asshat. Run do not walk! And take your boyfriend with you if you can, but you need to have some serious conversations about clenliness and what you do and do not put up with.", "NTA\n\nI'm curious why your BF finds this sort of deplorable hovel to be acceptable.  Do you two have such obscenely different definitions of \"livability\" such that moving with him - elsewhere! - might not be wise?", "NTA, and your bf shouldn\u2019t be there either. The landlord is violating all kinds of laws by having the house in that state. Do not move in. It\u2019s a disgusting and unsafe house. $1300 for it is ridiculous.", "NTA. You definitely shouldn't move in there and you have good reason.  But you should also perhaps give a lot of thought to moving in somewhere else with your boyfriend.

No. NTA.  \nNo fucking way would I choose to live in a rat infested shit hole.", "NTA, but you know that this isn't *just* the dodgy landlord, right? Your BF is willingly living like this and willing to have you move in.\n\nMaybe he can't afford anything better, but he certainly can clean out the rat shit and expired food in his home. \n\nYou can do better. Run. Run away from this mess", "NTA - why would anyone want to live there as it is?  Sounds like it needs to be condemned by the health department.  Why would your BF want live in such a dump.  That speaks volumes about him.   Run girl, run.", "NTA. Place sounds like it should be part of a horror movie.  Explain to your bf that no way would you move into a place in that condition.", "NTA - Dont move in", "NTA and best of luck.

The landlord has been very clear that he isn\u2019t going to fix anything, and things will keep rotting and falling apart.\n\nDo not move in. Aside from the unsafe flooring and the hazards of rats, it\u2019s terrible for your mental health, too. (I grew up in poverty, sometimes in falling-apart apartments.)\n\nAlso, no proof of payments and no lease is looking for trouble.\n\nTry to get your boyfriend out. Look into what\u2019s required to leave legally. There may be an implied lease or something. Probably he\u2019ll have to submit repair requests in writing and wait for the landlord to refuse it. Make sure everything is done on paper, not verbally, so he has proper documentation.", "NTA\nThis place is dangerous and unsanitary and needs to be reported. Don't pay the rent either, you bf knew what state this house was in and deemed it acceptable when it clearly isn't.

I would report the landlord to authorities tbh. Do not give him any money, period. Your boyfriend is a grown man.\n\nOn that point, why hasn\u2019t your boyfriend even attempted to tidy up at least? I understand he can\u2019t afford better. I grew up in poverty.. but everything was always clean, at least. That costs nothing.

And yet...with all that free time, there was still food in the cupboards from 2019? He knew you were about to move in and also didn't do any cleaning or rearranging to make the place nicer for you. People clean their homes when they have guests coming over for a few hours, let alone moving in! How does this not register to you as a red flag? Do you want to be stuck doing all the housework with this man for the rest of your life? Does he even care about you at all?\n\nYou owe your bf nothing, especially not rent. How dare he try to drag you, someone he supposedly loves, into a living situation that none of his previous roommates found tolerable. And the excuse about buying a car first? Shouldn't he have gotten another job while he's laid off to save up for that? \n\nI'm sure he has some lovely qualities that attracted you to him in the first place, but right now he mostly sounds like a loser. And he will either drag you down with him or make you work three times as hard to keep both of you afloat. Run, don't walk, away.", "Yeah this whole situation is just nightmare fuel.

Even split, $1300/month for a place that is falling apart ain't worth it, and a landlord asking for a \"non refundable deposit\" you just know this guy is going to be absolutely useless at everything aside from taking your money and will definitely attempt to violate your rights at every convenient opportunity.\n\nHelp your bf with rent if you want to, but you're certainly NTA for changing your mind about moving in.", "Nta. \nDo you really want to live with guy anywhere with how he is OK with living?

I\u2019m also really appalled that your boyfriend is living in those conditions! Did you go over there a lot before? Has it recently gotten bad or was it always this way?", "Nta", "NTA. The situation changed when you saw the full extent of the decay. I wondered why the rent was so incredibly cheap. that's the amt for a small apartment where I live, often with utilities not included. Also, if he's not willing to make structural repairs the house will be increasingly unsafe. That is not an okay living situation. He might be able to get a desperate student or artist to move in, but that's going to be about it.", "I mean, it's obviously a dump. You should not live there, want to live there, or feel bad about deciding not to. At all.\n\nIt frankly sounds like the place should be condemned.

At least now you know what his standards are. Be forewarned.\n\nNTA.\n\n\n.", "NTA but why are you giving them a dime? There's no lease, you're not moving in, the money's not going into the property.

Has she never been to her bf's place in the YEAR that they have been dating? How could someone put up with living like this?
