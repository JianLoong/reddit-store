Several rooms in the home have ceiling tiles falling down, there's clearly some damage to the flooring as there are \"weak spots\" and it is uneven, wood paneling is peeling off the walls, there are big holes in the drywall and drafty windows, and the house was filled with clutter from the previous owner (an old woman that died). I went to move a few kitchen items in this past Tuesday and realized the the food in the cupboards has been there since the owner of the home passed away, and now the cupboards are filled with rat shit from rats that have been feasting on the food this entire time. I cleaned the entire kitchen to the best of my ability, but it is still in really rough condition. These are not all of the issues with the home, just ones I am listing to give you some examples.\n\nThe landlord: he is the grandson of the original owner of the home and bought the property for $40k when she died in 2019, after speaking with him he explained to me that since buying the home he simply does not have the time nor interest to put in work to make the necessary repairs, and that the house is \"livable\".

On top of all of this he is an under the table landlord and only accepts cash and does not have a lease for me to sign.\n\nI no longer feel comfortable moving into the house, this has absolutely nothing to do with my bf and everything to do with the condition of the home and the lazy landlord.

AITA for telling him that I do not want to move in because of these reasons?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: To clarify, due to my bfs line of work he is laid off during the winter months so he will not be back to work until mid march, and before he can save to move he intends to save up to buy a car so he is unable to afford to move to a different place with me at this time.", "created_utc": 1677349540, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11brv8r/aita_for_changing_my_mind_about_moving_in/", "score": 446, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
