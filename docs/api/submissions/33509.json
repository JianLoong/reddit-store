We fully admit that some of this may be in our heads, but the evidence is definitely there.  For reasons I won\u2019t get into, she and my mom have always butted heads and we\u2019ve always felt like she\u2019s favored my aunt and her kids as a result. Currently (though this was not the case when we were kids), my aunt and her family live just down the street from her, and my parents, sister, and my husband and I live about 3 hours away. \n\nMy grandmother is having us all over this weekend for a Christmas gathering. One of her favorite things to do is make desserts for everyone. She\u2019s usually very good at taking everyone\u2019s requests and making what everyone likes. This year, she texted us all and asked us what we wanted. I requested a cake that I like, my mom requested some cookies, and my sister requested these chocolate cinnamon pretzels that she has made several times. \n\nMy grandmother said that she would make the rest of it, but she told my sister that she didn\u2019t want to make the pretzels again because she had already made them many times in the last couple of months for my uncle. She said that the other items would be eaten by multiple people, but she was worried that my uncle wouldn\u2019t eat them again and so my sister would be the only one eating them. \n\nMy sister was heartbroken. This is her favorite thing that my grandmother makes at Christmas, and she couldn\u2019t be bothered to make it once for my sister, despite making it repeatedly for my uncle. My sister also rightly pointed out that this is the cheapest and easiest dish that anyone has requested, and she offered to take home all the leftovers if they don\u2019t get eaten. To my sister, this seemed very much like the favoritism that we all talk about. She specifically asked what everyone wanted, made the things that everyone else asked for, and then left out to one small thing that my sister asked for. \n\nEven though my grandmother likes to be the one to make everything, I made the pretzels for my sister and brought them to Christmas. She was so happy to have her favorite dessert, but my grandmother was angry and said that it was her job to make the desserts for everyone. In fairness, she always makes tons of food and loves to do it. We\u2019ve never brought anything because she has told us she doesn\u2019t want us to. But I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of my little sister not having what she wanted when everyone else did.

That was so thoughtful of you!\n\nI'm not complaining about your approach,  but suggesting an alternative herr: you could have shared your favorite dessert with your sister at dinner, then casually give her the pretzels after dinner. It would seem less like a part of the meal but still would have made the point that you weren't going to let your sister get left out.\n\nI also grew up as one of the not-favored grandkids. I remember being at granny's house while she baked cookies for Valentine's Day and being told we couldn't have any because they were for our cousins.

From my experience, it was my mom, and she just got too overwhelmed making all the cookies for our large family. She didn\u2019t have time bw work and cleaning to make my fav cookies.  So i made them myself, and i was happy.  But _unlike_ your gran, my mom was thrilled (and proud) that I baked a perfect batch.\n\nTry not to let this bother you.

Your grandmother isn't obligated to make a dozen different desserts, her reason for not making that one was reasonable, and if she agreed to make the dessert you wanted, then she's not playing favorites against your mother's kids.", "I kinda think ESH \n\nWhat you did was pointed.

The granddaughter also offered a solution by offering to take any leftovers so they \u201cwouldn\u2019t go to waste\u201d.  If grandma didn\u2019t want to be called out for her actions, she needs to treat them all equally. The only reason anyone knew of her refusal was because SHE made a big deal about it. If she wants to claim it\u2019s \u201cher job\u201d to make desserts for everyone, then that\u2019s what she should have done. But she didn\u2019t. Fuck around and find out. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb", "One of my sisters is selective in her eating, and my mom made Chex mix with coconut oil at her request! But that was one year only. Even my sister agreed that it was gross and returned to eating the standard mix. But, my mom was kind enough to make her a special batch, as well as making a batch each year with no peanuts so my other sister who hates peanuts doesn't have to pick them out of the mix when she eats it.", "Well she did that though. Her whole thing was that she wanted to make people\u2019s favorites that would also be enjoyed by everyone.", "If her uncle likes them so much he\u2019s had them made for him multiple times this year, chances are many people would have enjoyed the pretzels.", "No point. The post was just worded strangely which made me doubt its veracity. But regardless, you are definitely NTA and you are a great sister."]}
