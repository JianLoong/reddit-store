{"id": 22117, "submission_id": "14yhkk2", "title": "AITA for not wanting to make French Onion soup for my sister?", "selftext": "I like to cook, mostly from scratch as I can be a picky eater and like to experiment with things I don't like to make them likable to me. That being said, I am trying to understand where my sister is coming from but she lacks communication skills from being a shut-in most of her life. My sister mainly cooks ready-made things and has recently moved in with me.\n\nI have been craving French Onion soup and I planned on making some soon. My sister HATES onions, specifically the texture of onions in any way shape, or form. I told her my plans to make myself the soup and she said she wanted some too. Weird but okay, I informed her that it would be majority onion, she knows but wants to strain the onion out for the broth. I do not see the point of discarding half the dish and somehow we got into an argument about how according to her \"onion power in veritable broth is the same thing as French Onion soup\", I offered to make her that instead and she is now mad at me because she wants what I am making but with the key ingredient strained out. To me, this just feels wasteful and insulting. As of now, I am not going to make it and I am being called an AH by everyone around me.\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: to answer some questions and assumptions in the comments. She does not want to learn how to cook this herself, the argument started on her end when I was asking why someone who didn't like onions wanted an onion-based meal. She has bad anxiety and possibly ADHD so she rambled on about a lot of things that didn't line up for me but she takes clarifying questions as an attack due to unresolved trauma, having an adult conversation with her is difficult. This isn't the first time she's gotten odd over how things are prepared when cooked. (A good example of this is when I was showing her how to make spaghetti sauce, she didn't want to use the crushed tomatoes as it's \"not a sauce\" when I tried to explain what I was doing to make it a sauce, she kept ranting about how it wasn't a sauce and she wanted to use Pollo de tomate and water because it \"was the same thing as a spaghetti sauce\", I was confused, continued my sauce as normal then after she picked out the tomato bits upset because she didn't like the texture of cooked tomato. She insisted that when she told me it wasn't a sauce I was somehow supposed to know she didn't like the texture of the cooked tomato. When asked why she didn't just say that she was upset for \"not wanting to over-explain herself\") yes, I'm getting close to the edge when it comes to just how picky she is and how reluctant she is to cook herself or explore other options or assist with meals because she is hyper-critical of everything. She lives with me because she was kicked out of her last place, I picked her up a state over. I am not kicking her out as she had nowhere to go and her employment is limited to her WFH side hustles. I wouldn't mind showing her how to cook, she has to want to, I will not force her.\n\nShe is great 90% of the time, I recognize she is struggling with a lot and I am trying to be compassionate and understanding, but I wanted one meal I could enjoy peacefully for myself without her picking it apart- again.\nWhen I can afford it I am just keeping ready to make items so we can just eat separately.\n\nAlso, I have suffered from a series of eating disorders so her putting the onions back after taking them out will just trigger my food anxiety, rationally I understand that it's the same thing and it's fine but I am still working through this in therapy. If my SO was here to take those onions instead I wouldn't have an issue but they're a trucker and won't be back for another month. I might just make the dish then to avoid this situation.", "created_utc": 1689245599, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14yhkk2/aita_for_not_wanting_to_make_french_onion_soup/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This seems to be an odd hill to die on.  I actually hate raw onions. But I\u2019m perfectly fine with cooked onions. \n\nLook, I get it.  If you\u2019re going to all that trouble to make something, it can feel wasteful.  French Onion soup is about more than the actual onions. It\u2019s also about the gooey awesomeness of the cheese and the crunchy bread/croutons.  And onions are cheap.  Whenever I\u2019ve eaten French Onion soup, I always run out of the good stuff and I\u2019m essentially spooning up broth at the end.  \n\nSeems to me that staining out some of the broth would be a win-win as you\u2019ve already gotten a good chunk of the onion flavor in the broth during the cooking process. \n\nBut your sister is being a dingbat if she thinks onion powder in broth in in any way comparable. \n\nLike I said, pretty odd hill to die on.", "What she wants is onion broth.

NAH  I agree you have a right to be annoyed . But why let petty things like this bother you so much\n\nYTA. This is just petty argument for a picky eater creating drama for no reason.
