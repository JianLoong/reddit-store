He moved away so I haven't been able to see him as much so when he invited me I was happy to say yes and attend. His bride, F26, is also someone I know and also a friend, though not best friends and I know she has quite a few better friends than me, so I was surprised to have been asked to be a bridesmaid for their wedding though it wasn't something that I turned down. Everything went well with us getting our bridesmaid dresses and whatnot and getting ready for the wedding. We were told that we could wear jewelry as long as it wasn't too flashy or showy. So come the day of the wedding  I show up and I'm not wearing much jewelry, just a pair of small beaded hoop earrings, and a beaded choker necklace that went blended well with the color of the dress. My friend complimented me on my necklace and earrings but later on before the ceremony the bride pulled me to the side and said that she said not to wear anything that was too flashy or showy to which I responded that I didn't think that it was and that \"too showy\" is subjective to the person. She kinda gave a huff and was obviously irritated from that point on, though she never asked me to take off my jewelry so I left it on for the whole ceremony and reception afterwards  but after the reception she brought it up again and we started to argue about it and I said that my cultural jewelry wasn't flashy or showy at all and it was cultural items that I'm wearing.

Leaving it vague means she has no right to be upset with you.", "Info: what culture are you speaking of in reference to the jewelry?", "NTA. \n\nHer definition of flashy was unclear. And it sounds a little like in this case your cultural jewelry wasn't so much flashy as it didn't fit in. I imagine the other bridesmaids were wearing something more traditional...plain metal, or perhaps lite sparkly diamonds which is why those were acceptable but your colorful beaded jewelry was not. Honestly it sounds like she didn't want to be an AH by demanding you remove it. BUT she definitely could have communicated that in a better way. Instead of \"not flashy\" she probably should have used words like  \"simple\" and \"traditional.\" \n\nEither way. She needs to build a bridge and get over it.\n\nEdited to add: Just saw the photo and holy heck that's what she was calling flashy? You're def in the clear op.

I can't see what the problem is.  Was it a wedding whereat the attendees all wore sack cloth or hair shirts like penitents, Glad garbage bags like literal white trash, hijabs, habits, hoods?  Did the bride take issue with the cultural element of the piece in question?  Weird.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - if the other brides maides also wore chokers and beaded earrings I don't see the issue.

Plus if she didn't want you to wear it she should've been an adult and told you in a nice way to take it off, instead she was passive aggressive and just insinuated you should take it off", "NTA, She sounds like a bit of a drama queen to be obsessed with a bit of jewellery on her wedding day you would think she would be to busy having fun and being blissfully happy to be bothered with such a small thing.. \nWhen she first brought it up you probably should have just removed some or all of it to keep the peace and save any \"bridezilla drama\"..", "I support anything that annoys a self-absorbed bride.

If not, your mere presence took attention from her, just because you are who you are.  Not saying it would be \"right\" if it's true. Just \"is\".  And there is nothing to be explained, excused or apologized for, if this is the case. Which I'm guessing was the actual issues.\n\nDid I call this one, OP?", "NTA - she should have been more specific", "I kind of think you missed the point of her saying it was showy. Most people I would have thought, would have said \"oh sorry I'll take it off\" at that point. However, she really didn't explicitly say this so maybe you're not the asshole but then again actually you really are YTA for missing such a very obvious social cue.", "NTA. I\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t look like Cleopatra on crack. So no, she has no right to tell you to take it off. That\u2019s ridiculous. She must have been really unhappy to get married if she chose to focus on a necklace.", "YTA. You argued with THE BRIDE on her wedding day about your accessories. The Bride.", "~~NTA - your not part of the wedding, your just a guest.~~\n\nYTA - you were a bridesmaid", "YTA, she asked you to take it off when she told you it was too showy. And you knew that then and know it now.", "YTA - her comment was your cue to take it off.", "YTA, it literally wouldn't inconvenience you at all to just not wear it. Maybe it makes no sense but who cares? It's not your wedding, it's not like she told you to cut your hair.", "[deleted]", "YTA - if the other bridesmaids were all wearing subtle gold earrings and necklaces and yours were beaded you should have taken yours off.  The whole concept of bridesmaids is that there is nothing artificially different to focus everyone's eyes on one besides the natural things like height, weight, and hair color.", "Soft YTA. I personally think your native jewelry is fine and not showy but, since you were a bridesmaid and the bride told you it was too showy and it was her wedding. I think the bride was being too picky, but it was her day.", "ESH", "I'm not sure why the jewelry was such a big thing and she should have been more specific if it was so important to her. But that said, I think as a bridesmaid you just go with it for her big day.", "NTA-That\u2019s not flashy or showy at all.", "NTA - I feel so very sorry for that bride. She spent one of the happiest (ahem, expensive), days of her life being jealous of a necklace. Her vanity and low esteem ruined her day, not you.", "Native beading is PHENOMENAL. I bet you looked lovely.

Problem is that the instructions were not very clear. How flashy something is, is very subjective. You should have discussed before together. \n\nIn the Situation, it would have been better to offer taking it off or asking to keep it on instead of discussing and doing nothing.  It's her day and whether you follow her opinion or not, you should just have accepted it. Therefore YTA.", "I'm Native American, I'm not going to go into specifics on what tribe I am but I'm Native American.", "This is exactly what I was thinking. I just couldn't think of the words.

Their wording is a bit confusing but in the part of them getting ready, it said that they put their bridesmaids dresses on.", "I think at this point in her life, she could have used her big girl words to tell her she would appreciate it if she took some of it off. Passive aggressive behavior is the quickest way to create misunderstandings.

I just wanted to make sure that by its part of your culture you actually meant that rather than what some people would say just because it\u2019s something they like to wear when they go out. \n\nI just feel like it\u2019s important context that most in this forum would try to hide to turn the tide in their favor", "That's defiantly not flashy!", "Nvm they were bridesmaids", "THIS! \n\nif the bride wanted her to remove the jewelry she should have SAID THAT.", "She got a good reaction from the groom - not the bride.
