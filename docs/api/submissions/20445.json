You don't need a bra, why waste your money. I would love to not need a bra (actually no one NEEDS it, but I feel more comfortable with one as I have big boobs, the extra support helps my back) \n\nThem getting uppity about nipples is them thinning of women's bodies in a sexual way. Which unfortunately is the way of most of society. It's not on you, it's on them, but the likelihood is they won't see your perspective. \n\nIn your shoes I would be petty back,  any male members of the family showing any nipple or too much skin....point it out, tell them it makes you feel uncomfortable and it's inappropriate, ask them to go change, I'm betting no one else will agree with you, so then play dumb \n\"Oh...but when I did it I was made to change, can you explain why it's different?\" \nIf they attempt an explanation, continue to play dumb \"sorry that doesn't make sense, why isn't it the same for me, can you explain?\" \n\nSimply keep asking people who have an issue with your body, to explain why the same is ok for a male body. Have them answer those things over and over. If and when they can't, or do the \"it's just how it is\" simply state \"that's very interesting, I'll be a little more relaxed about my body parts too\"", "Back in the 90\u2019s there wasn\u2019t an urgent need to have a bra on in casual settings. My mom had no problem walking to the corner store or to get the mail in just a bra less T,and my sister was the same way. It seems like it only became a big deal again fairly recently. That\u2019s strange,because I thought we were moving toward autonomy and everybody being their best selves. How do you do that with *more* restrictions than in the past? \ud83e\udd14", "NTA\n\nWear what you like! They're trying to have it both ways, you're an adult, so you have to dress 'properly,' but also you're a child who has to listen to them and can't make her own fashion decisions. It's really not their business. Basically you are completely in the right", "I don\u2019t think your the AH, you can dress however you want. My friend is the same, small chest, hates bras\u2026 tho when it\u2019s colder she will wear a padded bralette/crop under certain shirts so there\u2019s no nips peeking through so maybe that may appease the fam so they get off your case?

Why are your family members commenting on your nipples, you\u2019re just minding your own business dressing comfortably because god forbid you do that around your family. Youre not shaking ass in someone\u2019s face, if your body is offensive when you\u2019re wearing normal clothes and hanging out that\u2019s their fuckin problem. If I was wearing grey shorts and my aunts commented that they were looking down there I\u2019d be weirded out and not return either", "Pff, you are 20. You have full autonomy over your body. Definitely NTA. Who do they think they are? Next time, just ignore them and tell them that if they are bothered by it, it's probably because they have perverted minds.", "NTA I see nipples all the time, men's and women's. I also see butts and even the outline of genitalia sometimes. I see them, but I don't look at them and I certainly don't allow them to make me feel uncomfortable. It's time for your family members to start acting like adults. You shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable because they can't control themselves. I would have come back to the barbeque with a bra on. But no shirt.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but sometimes it\u2019s easier to just do certain things around family to avoid annoying conflicts. You don\u2019t HAVE to wear a bra. I support that. But it will keep your family quiet if you at least wear something maybe more loose so your nipples aren\u2019t the talk of the family event. It sucks, but family stuff often does. \n\nBack when I had nipple piercings I was always more conscious about what I wore to family events because I didn\u2019t want to even come to the point where people were discussing my nipples, so I\u2019ve been there. That shouldn\u2019t happen. People should mind there own business, but they don\u2019t. I personally couldn\u2019t handle the idea of the confrontation. \n\nIn the end, it\u2019s up to you if you want to avoid conflict or stand your ground. Neither answer is wrong or makes you an asshole. Honestly, it\u2019s super cool that you stood up for yourself and maybe they\u2019ll back off if you just keep doing you.", "\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0fyou\u2019re an adult now.

You didn't need to wear a bra if it's uncomfortable,  but you could have put on clothing where the nipples are not obvious.", "NTA. You can wear what you want, same as you can say what you want as long as it\u2019s not illegal. But no one is obliged to spend time with you if they are uncomfortable with what you say or wear.", "ESH. Tbh, I don't wish to see any nipple regardless of gender. Being properly covered is polite, no matter the gender. Wearing a bra around family as to not make anyone uncomfortable isn't that much of a request", "Slight YTA- I don't wear bras either but I do wear crop tops so that I don't have the issue of nipples poking out. It is different between men and women.", "I get what your argument is but sadly we live in a society where women\u2019s breasts are sexualised & it often makes people uncomfortable. Is it fair no of course it isn\u2019t; we should 100% be free to dress how we choose without judgement regardless of gender but we can\u2019t. \n\nThis the kind of situation where wearing a bra would have saved a lot of problems. You were clearly making other people uncomfortable & knew you would before you went. Should others have just accepted this is how you are? Yes of course they should but you knew they wouldn\u2019t, you knew they would be awkward with how you were dressed but did it anyway. You then left & sulked because no one could see your point of view. But at the same time you refused to see theirs so I\u2019m going with ESH\n\nAnd trust me no matter how small you are (this is a woman who went up a massive 32A when I was pregnant so I\u2019m speaking from experience) older you will definitely thank you for wearing a bra more often now. You can get sleep bras that are very comfortable & would be ideal for this type of occasion", "[deleted]", "I would say NTA but at the same time, their house their rules.", "I don\u2019t care, but it\u2019s not the same for girls + guys, a guys areole aren\u2019t generally regarded as sexual", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If thats the way you want to live its your life but be aware of the consequences. Otherwise you might look into finding a different type of bra that's more comfortable for you (assuming you havent already tried them all) or just be more cognizant and choose thicker shirts or layers.
