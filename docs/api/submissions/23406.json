We meet in school and immediately fell in love with each other. \n\nOf course I was devastated when he suddenly broke up with me. He said he \"fell out of love\" and that I don't fit into his future plans. It felt like my heart was being ripped out and stomped on. But there's nothing I can change about it and life goes on. This was about a month ago. \n\nA week later I found out about a method to get over your ex faster which I tried of course. It's where you take a piece of paper and write down everything that was not right about your ex partner (personality traits, actions, things they said, etc...). So I did that and noticed how a lot of things were not right about him, (especially his misogynistic thinking) but since I was blinded by love I was oblivious to it.\n\nThis really helped me see that he is not worth my tears or my time. I told my friends about this method and they were all really positive about it and said that they're glad that I'm doing better. Except for one. She said I was being mean and an a-hole for saying these things about him, which resulted in a big fight between me and her. I didn't and still don't know why she gets so worked up about me pointing out his red flags. \n\nThe next day I was bombarded with angry messages from her. She said things like \"how could you spread lies about him\" or \"how dare you drag his name through the dirt\" and so on and so forth. The thing is, I didn't even tell them the things I wrote down. I simply told them about the list but nothing more. So why does she become so upset? Later she said that I was an complete a-hole and she hates me and that she gets why my ex broke up with me. This broke my heart since she was a really close friend of mine.\n\nSo, am I really the a-hole?", "created_utc": 1690638596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cstdr/aita_for_telling_my_friend_my_coping_method/", "score": 607, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
