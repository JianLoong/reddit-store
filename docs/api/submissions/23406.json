We meet in school and immediately fell in love with each other. \n\nOf course I was devastated when he suddenly broke up with me. He said he \"fell out of love\" and that I don't fit into his future plans. It felt like my heart was being ripped out and stomped on. But there's nothing I can change about it and life goes on. This was about a month ago. \n\nA week later I found out about a method to get over your ex faster which I tried of course. It's where you take a piece of paper and write down everything that was not right about your ex partner (personality traits, actions, things they said, etc...). So I did that and noticed how a lot of things were not right about him, (especially his misogynistic thinking) but since I was blinded by love I was oblivious to it.\n\nThis really helped me see that he is not worth my tears or my time. I told my friends about this method and they were all really positive about it and said that they're glad that I'm doing better. Except for one. She said I was being mean and an a-hole for saying these things about him, which resulted in a big fight between me and her. I didn't and still don't know why she gets so worked up about me pointing out his red flags. \n\nThe next day I was bombarded with angry messages from her. She said things like \"how could you spread lies about him\" or \"how dare you drag his name through the dirt\" and so on and so forth. The thing is, I didn't even tell them the things I wrote down. I simply told them about the list but nothing more. So why does she become so upset? Later she said that I was an complete a-hole and she hates me and that she gets why my ex broke up with me. This broke my heart since she was a really close friend of mine.\n\nSo, am I really the a-hole?", "created_utc": 1690638596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cstdr/aita_for_telling_my_friend_my_coping_method/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She seems to be taking personal offense to you having things you don't like about him.", "NTA\n\nIs your ex-friend dating your ex-boyfriend? Because that's the only reason I can think of for her going into a hissy fit over what you said. You didn't even say what you didn't like about him, you just told your friends you made a list of all the things you didn't like about him to help you get over him. There is literally no reason for her to get upset about that.", "NTA. That's an amazing way to get over someone who doesn't want you that your still in love with. Yes it would be bad to go tell random people that list, and yes I can see it as being petty potentially if you dumped him. But using it for you just so you can get over him is a great idea. if it works keep using it.", "Nta. Your friend is way out of line and it sounds like she wants your ex. Unfortunately there's nothing for you to do here; there's no apology you owe and nothing that will change her mind about your list (which is innocuous btw). It may be that this friendship has run its course, or maybe she'll come to her senses and talk to you. But you're not in the wrong here.", "NTA \n\nMaybe your ex met up with your \u201cfriend\u201d I find it highly suspicious that she got that worked up about you pointing out what you didn\u2019t like.

I also speculate, like some other commentor here, that they like your ex boyfriend.

It seems like your friend has some kind of feelings or loyalty to the ex and so is defending him or feels like you are judging them for the fact that they may like or have feelings for him and so it is perceived as an indirect attack.\n\nIf you want to keep the friendship then let her know that this was just something that you found that is helping you deal with your emotions and state of mind. You do not expect her or anyone else to feel the same way just because you have done this.  \n\nLet her know you understand if she has a different set of feelings and if she really does feel differently and sees something in him then that is her prerogative and you appreciate that she didn't pursue him when you were together.  You do not think that opinions about an ex you are trying to get over should dictate the relationship between you two.  If down the line she decides she wants to pursue him you may have a hard time with it at first but that you will try to not let it interfere with your friendship.  \n\nAfter letting her know this her reaction and how she responds will tell you everything you want and need to know.  If she is mature and honest enough with herself and you you will find out, and if she has a thing for him and hasn't done anything yet at least she can think about what you have said and have a friend that will be there for her on the other side with him.", "NTA", "Sounds like the friend is a bit obsessive about your ex and is harboring a secret crush. \n\nNTA", "The sad thing about getting old is you have no more teenage drama over literally nothing.
