We had an amazing relationship until the last 6 months of our marriage. His behavior changed completely. One day he came home and said he didn\u2019t love me anymore and wanted a divorce. This came out of left field for me at the time. It shattered my world. We got through the divorce and I picked up the pieces and put myself back together. Met an amazing man 37M who is twice the man my ex husband will ever be. \n\nA few weeks ago I received a call from the police department my ex husband has applied to asking for a reference. I hesitated a bit and asked the woman on the other line if she was aware I was his ex wife. She said yes and that it would be beneficial for the department to get \u201call sides\u201d so I agreed. It was fairly standard questions for the most part then one caught me off gaurd. \u201cWould you trust him with your life?\u201d No. Hard no was my answer. She asked me to explain. I told her about a year after the divorce I had lunch with a mutual friend of both my ex and I who told me my ex husband had been cheating on me the last 6 months of our marriage with his now girlfriend, who was also married when the affair started. This woman was no just a coworker but in fact one of his superior officers at the time. \n\nThe interviewer then asked if I had confronted him about this. I said no because I hadn\u2019t spoken to him since the day at court where everything was finalized, and as far as I knew he didn\u2019t know I knew of the affair. She thanked me for the honestly and we ended the call. \n\nA few days after my ex husband started messaging me via text and social media (have blocked on everything at this point) telling me I cost him the job and I was a selfish bitch for not just lying so he could get on at a better department. I never responded to him so his girlfriend started doing the same. Also blocked with no response. \n\nWith this reaction from the both of them am I the asshole here?\n\n**Update**\n\nEither my ex or his girlfriend decided to make a fake Instagram and message both my boyfriend and I. We\u2019re done and fed up with this situation. We have screenshots of EVERY message they have sent me, and as of tonight my boyfriend. \n\nThank you so much people of Reddit! I\u2019ve read most of the comments but my stress and anxiety are both out of control. My boyfriend and I will be meeting with an attorney to see what options we have before we make any moves or decisions.", "created_utc": 1683495927, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13b3xxl/aita_for_not_lying_as_a_reference_for_my_ex/", "score": 436, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The last thing we need is more untrustworthy cops.", "NTA and VERY GLAD this dude didn\u2019t end up becoming a cop. \n\nNot necessarily bc he was a cheater but bc of how he\u2019s treating you after not getting the job. Like be real, he really had no other significant relationships in his life he could have listed as a reference besides his ex wife with who he is NOT EVEN IN CONTACT WITH?!", "NTA. They were hoping you would lie for them. You didn't cause you owe him nothing. Good for you!", "NTA. If he didn't want someone telling them he cheated, he shouldn't have cheated. My now ex wife pulled the same shit and told me to lie to others about our split and I laughed in her face and told her I was going to tell others the truth about what happened and let them decide what to think.  Should have been nicer and I wouldn't have to tell others you were a prick.", "NTA. Tell them, \u201csorry, I thought lying to the police was a crime,\u201d if they ever contact you again.", "NTA, why would you have to lie for him? He's your ex, and (I assume) you weren't trying to sabotage him or anything. It'd be one thing if you lied to be petty simply because he's your ex, but he did cheat, you were honest, that's what you're supposed to do.", "NTA.\n\n>I was a selfish bitch for not just lying\n\nDoes he recommend to suspects that they should lie to escape punishment?\n\n>A few days after my ex husband started messaging me via text and social media\n\n>I never responded to him so his girlfriend started doing the same.\n\nHe still thinks he's suitable?", "NTA\n\n\"my ex husband started messaging me via text and social media (have blocked on everything at this point) telling me I cost him the job\"\n\nAbsolutely NOT!\n\nHE cost himself the job by his own actions. \n\nHe and his new gf started harassing you as a result of your refusal to lie for him.  \n\nThere is no way in HELL he should be a police officer, as others have said.", "Pretty sure him doing that and his gf also doing it can be considered harassment, which can have charges pressed. Maybe contact the dept that called you and inform them of his actions, not out of spite, but because they may like to know what kind of people are in their communities.\n\nNTA by the way", "NTA. Similar situation here when my abusive ex tried to get top secret clearance. He had been stupid enough to email me some of his threats and threats to his new wife's ex husband. I gave copies to the military person who interviewed me. He had also put in the email how he intended to use his government position to harass her ex's new girlfriend.  Oh he called and messaged in a fury when he was denied, but I ignored him. I can't imagine someone that evil having the power and authority of law enforcement or the military behind them.", "NTA\n\nGuess he shouldn't have cheated. You are entitled to your feelings and have no obligation to lie for an ex from years ago. I imagine his denial wasn't purely based on your response.", "NTA, you HAVE to be honest, you did nothing wrong.  Just block them all and move one.  He is the one that cost himself the job, not you.", "NTA. You owe him nothing. This is on him.", "NTA you don\u2019t owe him anything.", "NTA, why would your life for him? But I'm wondering, is that standard  behavior from the police department?", "NTA unless you said you would be a reference beforehand or lied. \n\nIt seriously astonishes me sometimes who people put as references. He should have been more careful, and got what was coming for him.", "NTA - and my stepdad is chief of police in a large dept. They need to know *everything* before they hire someone, they are quite literally putting the safety of the general public in their hands. Now the new dept knows if your husband does something against the rules or unflattering to himself he\u2019ll lie and cover it up to save his own ass. That makes him untrustworthy and not a good hire. Not to mention a liability. You did the right thing, and if you didn\u2019t tell them they would\u2019ve found out eventually.", "NTA if his girlfriend is messaging you make copies of the messages and sent them to her superiors.", "NTA Why should you lie for an AH who cheated on you?! Who name the ex-wife as the reference if you didn\u2019t broke-up in good terms?! You did people a favor. We don need such cops. How would he have done the work if he has no problem with twisting the truth till it is a circle as long as it benefits him...?", "NTA  \nPeople should NOT ALWAYS be the \"bigger person\"  \nIf you're pissed at someone (especially if its their fault) you have the absolute right of not helping them out.", "NTA- f- around, find out. Literally", "NTA and thanks for doing your small part in keeping lunatics with guns off the streets.", "NTA", "Solid gold NTA with glitter and tinsel on. If you couldn't trust him with your life then you couldn't trust him with anyone else's life either. Not sure how much of what you said would have been made known to him beyond that you did not consent to a reference, but you did the right thing. He breached a trust and a vow. That is a significant thing.", "NTA\n\nBut only because you presented the information as heresay.\n\nA mutual friend told you. You never confirmed. Sounds like the interviewer did confirm.\n\nYou really don't know if the friend was telling the truth. Maybe he wanted the promotion?\n\nIt would seem the friend was telling the truth, because verifying that the person he's now dating was his boss.", "NTA You were just being honest. What did he expect? If he didn't want the consequences of your reference he should have left you out of it.", "NTA, tell them that you're pretty sure that if they knew he wanted you to lie, he'd probably lose more than just a transfer/promotion.", "NTA FTP", "Absolutely NTA, and as a fellow officer, I\u2019m appalled that he even went that route. Lying on an application at any point is grounds for immediate termination if/when it surfaces, sometimes even years, later. What an idiot. Glad you found someone better and more deserving!", "NTA.  File a restraining order.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t cost him the job. His own behavior did that. He has only himself to blame. I wonder how many other lies the interviewer uncovered?", "You reported unsubstantiated rumor as fact and seem to have done so due to animosity. \n\nYes, your friend told you this stuff. But you haven't related any  \n\nSuch background checks are not to see if he was a great husband. It was to check for things like a history of domestic violence, other criminal behavior, or issues of personal dishonesty that you personally observed.", "[deleted]", "YTA honestly. Cheating sucks but not a reason to mess with someone's career nor does it mean you couldn't \"trust him with your life.\" I would have just told them I wasn't interested in being a reference and hung up.", "NTA\n\nKarma is a b*tch, but you\u2019re not.", "NTA.  If fact I would contact ex and tell him that he needs to back off and stop the harassment or you will contact his current department and report him.", "NTA. Sounds like the better department is better because it doesn't hire people like your Ex.", "NTA, and you could have been way more petty. I guess most people wouldn\u2019t change their ratings lol", "Minimally if someone wants you to lie for them they have to give you a heads up, but you\u2019re not obligated to do it.  Mind reading is never required, and lying for someone is optional.  NTA", "NTA. He should've thought about being an honest husband before deciding he just wanted his d!ck sucked all those years ago. Continue living your best life!!!", "NTA. But you should call his superior or someone higher up at his department and state that you\u2019re worried about him retaliating against you.", "NTA\n\nNah she asked you a question & you answered truthfully. You owe him nothing.", "NTACAB!", "Something that can be ruined by the truth should be ruined. NTA", "NTA.  You answered honestly.  Maybe he should have considered not being a dick.", "NTA\n\nLol I feel like you knew you were in the right but it does feel good to have a bunch of online people agree with you", "NTA. He obviously has anger issues and shouldn\u2019t be a cop.", "NTA. Honestly this is the definition of \"fuck around and find out\".", "NTA sounds exactly like the type of person who shouldn't be a cop, might want to change your phone number now though.", "NTA, THANK YOU for your honesty!! He isn\u2019t worthy of a job of trust and I\u2019m damn grateful that someone is actually checking to see if a person is worthy of trust before they give them power and a gun. \n\nHis shitty choices are not your fault, he should only be mad at himself.", "Hell no, NTA", "NTA. Lying about his affairs for a job of that position is unethical. How inpet do you have to be to put your ex-wife that you cheated on with another department official as your reference?", "You aren't obligated to lie for anyone,  ever. And as a member of the public, you have my thanks. We don't need more assholes with badges and guns on the streets. NTA", "You\u2019re in the clear. Not to be trusted w/ anyone\u2019s life.", "NTA. He lives in a dream world.", "NTA - you did that community a service, because anyone who\u2019d ask you to lie isn\u2019t someone qualified for the job.\n\nHe cheated on you. \n\nYou owe him nothing.\n\nKeep on moving on and enjoy your new life!\n\nI\u2019d also get a ring doorbell, because he nor the AP sound great.", "NTA. Honestly, glad he's now an ex-cop. He was clearly not a good one if he wanted you to lie to his supervisor/superior just to get a job at a better department. Glad you got away from him.", "NTA.  Lying to the cops is not a good look and I would have done the same in your shoes.  I agree with the others that say to let the department know about the harassing messages he sent you.", "Keep all those messages for when he next applies to a job. Just forward the screenshots.", "NTA. Sounds like a psycho who lies for a living!", "NTA obviously. But I\u2019m also concerned how the ex found out it\u2019s because of your reference that he did not get the job? References should be confidential. Makes you wonder about the police department\u2026.", "NTA who lists an ex without talking to them first. He's so dumb he shouldn't get the promotion. Liar, cheater and an idiot....glad you are with someone better.", "NTA. He\u2019s obviously abusive and a liar. He cost himself a job, not you or anything the OP did. He clearly has issues with taking responsibility for his actions and that should be a major red flag for any police department.", "I think you missed the fact that he's already a cop, just shopping for a better job.\n\nDoesn't detract from the validity of your comment.", "That's all cops", "Unfortunately he IS a cop. I helped him get the job in 2014. He\u2019s just looking at different departments.", "THIS. If he had been honest about the affair maybe this would have been different for him.", "I definitely wasn\u2019t trying to be petty or sabotage. I\u2019ve completely moved on from him which is why this whole thing caught me off guard in the first play. I was shocked he even listed me to be honest.", "And it should probably be reported to his current dept \ud83e\udd14", "Sadly he is. Just not with this new department. I helped him get on at his current department while we were married. Hindsight here.", "This is a good idea. Thank you!", "\u201cOh hello, consequences of my own actions\u2026\u201d\n\nNTA", "I actually dig into it. Apparently it was a requirement on the department\u2019s application to list any ex spouses along with current significant others. Who knew. Not me! \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I definitely didn\u2019t know. Apparently he was required to list me as an ex spouse per department policy.", "That feels petty but I\u2019m not opposed to it at this point \ud83d\ude02", "My boyfriend and I thought about this. Neither my ex husband nor his girlfriend know where we live. I got the shared house in the divorce because he couldn\u2019t afford it on his own and I could (also got the dog and truck, living a country song here). We sold the house 2 years ago and moved. A restraining order provides them with our home address.", "Definitely. Include the girlfriend if possible.", "Absolutely false.  She said her information was hearsay.  She did not report it as fact.  And the question was whether she would trust him and the answer was no and she shared why.  It was up to the department to decide whether or how to verify, believe or rely on this information.  \n\nLook at you affirmatively stating why the question was asked and how it should have been answered as narrowly as possible to protect the very type of person they are trying to discover by asking ex spouses this question.", "You really think we need more police officers who cheat on their wives, demand their ex-wives lie to the police, and then harass their ex-wives for telling the truth?? WTF.", "Oof. Welp, you certainly don\u2019t owe him anything further regardless!", "You would even be NTA to reach out to his current agency and let them know he\u2019s lying on applications to other agencies\u2026 that\u2019s a huge integrity issue.", "All cops are bastards. You married their king.", "It's not like you went out of your way and lied about it saying he was worse on purpose. You told the truth about it, which is exactly what they were looking for by calling his ex wife for different perspectives on topics. Not your fault if he made that truth an unfortunate one.", "Yeah, your ex is a major AH.", "My ex-husband did the same. Only he'd cheated as a security guard on a college campus with students. So that detail tanked his application.", "Please update on this!! And definitely NTA fuck that guy", "It\u2019s not petty, those cops are harassing you.", "Oh not petty at all.  He's mad at you for not lying.  Go for it", "If they are on the police-force they can easily find where you live.  You can request they not know your address as part of the protective order.  I would speak to an attorney.", "they could easily find out where she lives but unfortunately for him and the girlfriend it is actually against law enforcement policy to look up personal information like that unless its for a case if they look up her address through the department they could face loosing there jobs there shields and possibly criminal charges as well so I say let them dig themselves a huge whole they can't dig out of", "It was very stupid of him to list you without checking with you and finding out what you would say. NTA.", "So you wouldn\u2019t trust him with your life because after you were divorced, you heard a rumor that he cheated on you at the end of your marriage?\n\nIs that accurate? Or am I missing something? Is there more to it?", "NTA and you're a hero for being honest.  His shitty behavior cost him the job, not your honesty. Tbh I'd report his and his lady's harassing messages to his superiors", "You are good.", "NTA, you owe this man nothing. Idk why he thought you would be the one to sing his praises but that was a fail on his part. You were just being honest", "Clap Clap Clap!!!! Brava!!!!", "Sounds like harassment. Pretty sure there's laws against that \ud83d\ude02\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA, all this behavior does indeed sound like the behavior of a cop so not surprised", "NTA. Is he wanted you to speak warmly of him, he should have behaved better.", "NTA.  He literally effed around and now found out.", "NTA!  I have lived through such a similar story. My ex cheated on me and it cost him his job (his own fault, not mine). All I can say is karma catches up with people. Guess Karma caught up with your ex!", "He shouldn't have put someone he screwed over as a reference! That was stupid on his part. NTA", "NTA. \n\nYour ex's appalling reaction alone proves that you were right to reveal your friend's allegations that your ex had a 6 month affair with a married coworker in the police force.    The reaction of his gf proves that the two of them deserve each other and they are both a liability to whatever police forces employ them. I hope that they both find themselves unemployed very soon.   \n\nMaybe consider taking copies of all the text and social media abuse that they have sent you with the comments that you should have lied to the police to a lawyer or high profile politician who is very experienced in successfully working with law enforcement divisions to help them them get rid of the rotten apple officers that pollute their ranks.", "NTA - This is the exact REASON that police departments and public positions will often ask for and require applicants to list personal relationships.", "NTA.", "NTA. He cheated. He deserves everything that comes at him. Not to mention, he wanted you to lie to law enforcement? And it not benefit you in any way?", "NTA - you were clear that you got the information about the affair from a third party, and that you hadn't discussed the info you were given with your ex. If the interviewer/hiring team did their due diligence, they would have tried to confirm the accuracy of what you shared. Either it was confirmed, in which case your husband is facing a consequence of his own actions, or it wasn't confirmed but the department's screening processes took it into account anyway, in which case that's a consequence of their screening practices.\n\n(Of course, it's also possible that he didn't get the job for other reasons, or a combination of reasons.)\n\nRegardless, it was the department's decision not to hire him. But I bet he's not harassing them about it...", "Haha. I have heard of entitled cheaters getting mad at coworkers for not concealing their adultery from their wives, but mad at the wife for not concealing their adultery from their coworkers? A new one. \n\nNTA\n\nOK if you were going around \u201cwarning\u201d people about your faithless ex, that might be over the line, but not lying about being cheated on when lying might be a crime?", "NTA - he puts you on the application after years of no contact, doesn\u2019t bother to warn you, you tell the truth, and he and his gf get mad? If he wanted you to lie, he should have been a grown up, reached out, fessed up, apologized, and then left it to you to decide how to handle.", "NTA. Talk to your divorce lawyer for advice on whether you should agree to be a reference at all.", "NTA. Fuck him. Never ceases to amaze me how many people think treating you like shit and then asking you for a favor is a good strategy.", "NTA this is why the police contacted you. Do you think it\u2019s smart for them to employee a man who immediately started harassing you for telling the truth? You did the right thing for anyone who would have encountered him as a police officer. Anyone who would have lied isn\u2019t a good person", "NTA\n\n\nBut WTF is wrong with the hiring department that that let him know her comments were why he wasn't hired?! They put you at risk.\n\nStay safe.", "Of course NTA, there's no scenario where you want to use an ex as a job reference in an unamiable divorce.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t exaggerate. You just truthfully answered the questions they asked you. \n\n(Kinda shocked that would cost him a cop job based on how cops are, but that\u2019s his problem.)", "Definitely NTA. I\u2019d just send this in an email to his superiors at his current police department. That\u2019ll probably get him in trouble there.", "NTA.. he tried  to use you to get into a better situation for himself, his girlfriend is the one who will benefit.. he tried to make a fool out of you\u2026 the audacity of him to get upset. He sound really entitled, he could have at least give you a heads up about putting you down as a reference for him ,but I guess he thought so little of you that he assumed that you would just lie for him.", "NTA. \n\nSo they think harassing you will make you a better reference in the future? \n\nOdd.", "If he wanted to be remembered warmly he should have behaved better. It's not your job to lie for anyone. NTA", "\"Do you trust this man to protect and serve?\"\n\n\"HE CHEATED ON ME!\"\n\nYeah, he's a dick. I don't really think you answered the question appropriately. Also do you have kids with this guy? If so, wouldn't you WANT him to make more money?", "The last thing we need is more untrustworthy cops.", "nta, but why would standard policy for a job be to speak to someone's exes?  Of course they are mostly going to have bad things to say, that's why they are exes.  Very weird cheating disqualified him from the job; they should have been just looking for abuse (and frankly the questioning should have been just limited to whether he abused you).", "Asked and answered, nta. It would be different if you added in gossip for no reason, if the interviewer checked with him and he still lost the opportunity it\u2019s a nonissue. If they didn\u2019t check with him, he maybe able to appeal if the gossip was untrue. Why he didn\u2019t ask his current partner is interesting and telling. \n\nGood to hear you\u2019re looking at your safety, take care.", "I'm mad at HR for even telling him that you gave him a bad reference. That should be confidential information.", "Many application processes make you fill out all relationships going back decades. I had a roommate ask for my info 20 years after living together because she was applying to be a police officer. The woman who couldn\u2019t remove a small spider from her bedroom wanted to carry a gun.", "Nah. I have a brother in law that\u2019s in law enforcement and this is standard.", "He was required to list her as she\u2019s his ex-wife.", " the type of person who shouldn't be a cop, might want to change your phone number now though.", "Exactly!", "Yeah, could just say \u201cThe last we need is more cops.\u201d They\u2019re all bastards.", "Or be honest. And split up first. Then it\u2019s not an affair.", "Considering he thought you were the best choice for a reference, that's telling of how he's living his life.  Like everyone he's currently close too knows him too well to vouch for him?", "To be fair, I believe in a lot of cases they ask for all sorts of contacts\u2026 including exes. Omitting your name could be considered lying. Might be that rather than he just assumed you\u2019d lie for him!", "PLEASE screenshot the messages of him telling you to lie to police. They should know about it.", "It's not. Having a relationship with a subordinate is a massive abuse of power, and a huge red flag for a cop. So are the messages", "It\u2019s not petty when you think about the power that the police have over other people. He\u2019s trying to manipulate you about this, what will happen to an innocent person that just fits his narrative in a crime he wants to get credit for solving?", "I worked in law enforcement for years, including running such checks. I have a general idea why such checks are run.\n\nAnd I've dealt with a few excellent officers, a few who I helped convict, and a whole lot who are doing a job and nothing more. \n\nShe heard a rumor about her ex, well after they divorced. The more interesting follow up question should have been if she would have answered no after the divorce but before the friend told her this.", "u/Healtsbdc is a bot.", "Unfortunately, it's not a lie to list her as a reference on an application for a public position such as police. It is standard to list family, relationships, exes, children, etc, and for some positions it is a requirement. Ommiting the ex wife would be an integrity issue as well.\nThese references are submitted for the EXACT reasons as OP described above - so a department can have a picture of a persons history.", "Your perspective behind based on law enforcement experience is disheartening to hear.  I was giving major credit to the new department for reaching out to ex spouses of law enforcement - considering the rates of domestic violence and how important it is for LEOs to be honest, trustworthy, rational people - it seemed very progressive to go to the people who aren\u2019t likely to just rubber stamp a recommendation.  But from what you are saying, and what you think the follow up should be, it looks like you\u2019d actually be trying to ask questions as narrowly as possible to avoid a ding on the report.  \n\nFrom the outside perspective, she thought she knew him.  His behavior changed completely on a dime.  Whether it was adultery like she later heard, drugs, mental illness, split personality\u2026 who knows.  Most people would not feel safe with someone who can completely morph on the person they love with no warning or reason.  I\u2019d think that would be relevant to a character analysis.  \n\nBut from what you are saying, you wouldn\u2019t have seen it that way.  And you would discard her impressions because it wasn\u2019t based on firsthand knowledge (although the corroborating facts of him being with the woman he allegedly had the affair with is pretty damning).  \n\nUgh.  So hard to have trust in these institutions.", "Having an affair with a superior officer on the other hand....", "They are dumb enough to harass her and tell her to lie to the other department. We aren\u2019t working with the cream of the crop here.", "I asked questions to get at the difference between the personal experience an individual had with a candidate as opposed to what they have heard as a rumor.\n\nYou can certainly follow up the rumor. Ask this friend. Why do they think he was cheating? Ask the woman he was allegedly cheating with. Check for any facts you can nail down.\n\nI had to keep in mind what motivations the person providing information might have. Are they trying to make the candidate look good by hiding something? If I ask them about something negative I know about the candidate what would they say? Do they deny it? Claim no knowledge? \n\nAnd sometimes I had an ex tell me negative things that just did not mesh with verifiable facts. Are they trying to torpedo the candidate's application? What are they saying and why are they saying this?\n\nI would have asked a LOT more questions of people other than the OP. I would have been less concerned with infidelity and much more concerned with what, if anything, was done to conceal it (assuming he was unfaithful and this wasn't a falsity.)\n\nAnd sometimes you just can't tell for certain what the truth was.", "Your first response criticized OP for sharing her experience at all even though she told the interviewer the information was hearsay.  And you said that\u2019s not what they were trying to hear about.  \n\nBut now you are saying that you would ask all of these questions and interview all of these other people to determine veracity of what she shared.  \n\nI\u2019m sure there is a lot to the process and this forum isn\u2019t doing it justice, but it sounds like for OP, it was the right thing to share because it was her experience and she answered truthfully.  And now the LEO ex is harassing her on a few forums for it so we\u2019d all probably be better off if someone would check his behavior."]}
