We had an amazing relationship until the last 6 months of our marriage. His behavior changed completely. One day he came home and said he didn\u2019t love me anymore and wanted a divorce. This came out of left field for me at the time. It shattered my world. We got through the divorce and I picked up the pieces and put myself back together. Met an amazing man 37M who is twice the man my ex husband will ever be. \n\nA few weeks ago I received a call from the police department my ex husband has applied to asking for a reference. I hesitated a bit and asked the woman on the other line if she was aware I was his ex wife. She said yes and that it would be beneficial for the department to get \u201call sides\u201d so I agreed. It was fairly standard questions for the most part then one caught me off gaurd. \u201cWould you trust him with your life?\u201d No. Hard no was my answer. She asked me to explain. I told her about a year after the divorce I had lunch with a mutual friend of both my ex and I who told me my ex husband had been cheating on me the last 6 months of our marriage with his now girlfriend, who was also married when the affair started. This woman was no just a coworker but in fact one of his superior officers at the time. \n\nThe interviewer then asked if I had confronted him about this. I said no because I hadn\u2019t spoken to him since the day at court where everything was finalized, and as far as I knew he didn\u2019t know I knew of the affair. She thanked me for the honestly and we ended the call. \n\nA few days after my ex husband started messaging me via text and social media (have blocked on everything at this point) telling me I cost him the job and I was a selfish bitch for not just lying so he could get on at a better department. I never responded to him so his girlfriend started doing the same. Also blocked with no response. \n\nWith this reaction from the both of them am I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1683495927, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13b3xxl/aita_for_not_lying_as_a_reference_for_my_ex/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The last thing we need is more untrustworthy cops.", "NTA and VERY GLAD this dude didn\u2019t end up becoming a cop. \n\nNot necessarily bc he was a cheater but bc of how he\u2019s treating you after not getting the job. Like be real, he really had no other significant relationships in his life he could have listed as a reference besides his ex wife with who he is NOT EVEN IN CONTACT WITH?!", "NTA. They were hoping you would lie for them. You didn't cause you owe him nothing. Good for you!", "NTA. If he didn't want someone telling them he cheated, he shouldn't have cheated. My now ex wife pulled the same shit and told me to lie to others about our split and I laughed in her face and told her I was going to tell others the truth about what happened and let them decide what to think.  Should have been nicer and I wouldn't have to tell others you were a prick.", "NTA. Tell them, \u201csorry, I thought lying to the police was a crime,\u201d if they ever contact you again.", "NTA, why would you have to lie for him? He's your ex, and (I assume) you weren't trying to sabotage him or anything. It'd be one thing if you lied to be petty simply because he's your ex, but he did cheat, you were honest, that's what you're supposed to do.", "NTA.\n\n>I was a selfish bitch for not just lying\n\nDoes he recommend to suspects that they should lie to escape punishment?\n\n>A few days after my ex husband started messaging me via text and social media\n\n>I never responded to him so his girlfriend started doing the same.\n\nHe still thinks he's suitable?", "NTA\n\n\"my ex husband started messaging me via text and social media (have blocked on everything at this point) telling me I cost him the job\"\n\nAbsolutely NOT!\n\nHE cost himself the job by his own actions. \n\nHe and his new gf started harassing you as a result of your refusal to lie for him.  \n\nThere is no way in HELL he should be a police officer, as others have said.", "Pretty sure him doing that and his gf also doing it can be considered harassment, which can have charges pressed. Maybe contact the dept that called you and inform them of his actions, not out of spite, but because they may like to know what kind of people are in their communities.\n\nNTA by the way", "NTA. Similar situation here when my abusive ex tried to get top secret clearance. He had been stupid enough to email me some of his threats and threats to his new wife's ex husband. I gave copies to the military person who interviewed me. He had also put in the email how he intended to use his government position to harass her ex's new girlfriend.  Oh he called and messaged in a fury when he was denied, but I ignored him. I can't imagine someone that evil having the power and authority of law enforcement or the military behind them.", "NTA\n\nGuess he shouldn't have cheated. You are entitled to your feelings and have no obligation to lie for an ex from years ago. I imagine his denial wasn't purely based on your response.", "NTA, you HAVE to be honest, you did nothing wrong.  Just block them all and move one.  He is the one that cost himself the job, not you.", "NTA. You owe him nothing. This is on him.", "NTA you don\u2019t owe him anything.", "NTA, why would your life for him? But I'm wondering, is that standard  behavior from the police department?", "NTA unless you said you would be a reference beforehand or lied. \n\nIt seriously astonishes me sometimes who people put as references. He should have been more careful, and got what was coming for him.", "NTA - and my stepdad is chief of police in a large dept. They need to know *everything* before they hire someone, they are quite literally putting the safety of the general public in their hands. Now the new dept knows if your husband does something against the rules or unflattering to himself he\u2019ll lie and cover it up to save his own ass. That makes him untrustworthy and not a good hire. Not to mention a liability. You did the right thing, and if you didn\u2019t tell them they would\u2019ve found out eventually.", "NTA if his girlfriend is messaging you make copies of the messages and sent them to her superiors.", "NTA Why should you lie for an AH who cheated on you?! Who name the ex-wife as the reference if you didn\u2019t broke-up in good terms?! You did people a favor. We don need such cops. How would he have done the work if he has no problem with twisting the truth till it is a circle as long as it benefits him...?", "NTA  \nPeople should NOT ALWAYS be the \"bigger person\"  \nIf you're pissed at someone (especially if its their fault) you have the absolute right of not helping them out.", "NTA- f- around, find out. Literally", "NTA and thanks for doing your small part in keeping lunatics with guns off the streets.", "NTA", "Solid gold NTA with glitter and tinsel on. If you couldn't trust him with your life then you couldn't trust him with anyone else's life either. Not sure how much of what you said would have been made known to him beyond that you did not consent to a reference, but you did the right thing. He breached a trust and a vow. That is a significant thing.", "NTA\n\nBut only because you presented the information as heresay.\n\nA mutual friend told you. You never confirmed. Sounds like the interviewer did confirm.\n\nYou really don't know if the friend was telling the truth. Maybe he wanted the promotion?\n\nIt would seem the friend was telling the truth, because verifying that the person he's now dating was his boss.", "NTA You were just being honest. What did he expect? If he didn't want the consequences of your reference he should have left you out of it.", "NTA, tell them that you're pretty sure that if they knew he wanted you to lie, he'd probably lose more than just a transfer/promotion.", "NTA FTP", "Absolutely NTA, and as a fellow officer, I\u2019m appalled that he even went that route. Lying on an application at any point is grounds for immediate termination if/when it surfaces, sometimes even years, later. What an idiot. Glad you found someone better and more deserving!", "NTA.  File a restraining order.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t cost him the job. His own behavior did that. He has only himself to blame. I wonder how many other lies the interviewer uncovered?", "You reported unsubstantiated rumor as fact and seem to have done so due to animosity. \n\nYes, your friend told you this stuff. But you haven't related any  \n\nSuch background checks are not to see if he was a great husband. It was to check for things like a history of domestic violence, other criminal behavior, or issues of personal dishonesty that you personally observed.", "[deleted]", "YTA honestly. Cheating sucks but not a reason to mess with someone's career nor does it mean you couldn't \"trust him with your life.\" I would have just told them I wasn't interested in being a reference and hung up.", "NTA\n\nKarma is a b*tch, but you\u2019re not.", "NTA.  If fact I would contact ex and tell him that he needs to back off and stop the harassment or you will contact his current department and report him.", "NTA. Sounds like the better department is better because it doesn't hire people like your Ex.", "NTA, and you could have been way more petty. I guess most people wouldn\u2019t change their ratings lol", "Minimally if someone wants you to lie for them they have to give you a heads up, but you\u2019re not obligated to do it.  Mind reading is never required, and lying for someone is optional.  NTA", "NTA. He should've thought about being an honest husband before deciding he just wanted his d!ck sucked all those years ago. Continue living your best life!!!", "NTA. But you should call his superior or someone higher up at his department and state that you\u2019re worried about him retaliating against you.", "NTA\n\nNah she asked you a question & you answered truthfully. You owe him nothing.", "NTACAB!", "Something that can be ruined by the truth should be ruined. NTA", "NTA.  You answered honestly.  Maybe he should have considered not being a dick.", "NTA\n\nLol I feel like you knew you were in the right but it does feel good to have a bunch of online people agree with you", "NTA. He obviously has anger issues and shouldn\u2019t be a cop.", "NTA. Honestly this is the definition of \"fuck around and find out\".", "NTA sounds exactly like the type of person who shouldn't be a cop, might want to change your phone number now though.", "NTA, THANK YOU for your honesty!! He isn\u2019t worthy of a job of trust and I\u2019m damn grateful that someone is actually checking to see if a person is worthy of trust before they give them power and a gun. \n\nHis shitty choices are not your fault, he should only be mad at himself.", "Hell no, NTA", "NTA. Lying about his affairs for a job of that position is unethical. How inpet do you have to be to put your ex-wife that you cheated on with another department official as your reference?", "You aren't obligated to lie for anyone,  ever. And as a member of the public, you have my thanks. We don't need more assholes with badges and guns on the streets. NTA", "You\u2019re in the clear. Not to be trusted w/ anyone\u2019s life.", "NTA. He lives in a dream world.", "NTA - you did that community a service, because anyone who\u2019d ask you to lie isn\u2019t someone qualified for the job.\n\nHe cheated on you. \n\nYou owe him nothing.\n\nKeep on moving on and enjoy your new life!\n\nI\u2019d also get a ring doorbell, because he nor the AP sound great.", "NTA. Honestly, glad he's now an ex-cop. He was clearly not a good one if he wanted you to lie to his supervisor/superior just to get a job at a better department. Glad you got away from him.", "NTA.  Lying to the cops is not a good look and I would have done the same in your shoes.  I agree with the others that say to let the department know about the harassing messages he sent you.", "Keep all those messages for when he next applies to a job. Just forward the screenshots.", "NTA. Sounds like a psycho who lies for a living!", "NTA obviously. But I\u2019m also concerned how the ex found out it\u2019s because of your reference that he did not get the job? References should be confidential. Makes you wonder about the police department\u2026.", "NTA who lists an ex without talking to them first. He's so dumb he shouldn't get the promotion. Liar, cheater and an idiot....glad you are with someone better.", "NTA. He\u2019s obviously abusive and a liar. He cost himself a job, not you or anything the OP did. He clearly has issues with taking responsibility for his actions and that should be a major red flag for any police department.", "I think you missed the fact that he's already a cop, just shopping for a better job.\n\nDoesn't detract from the validity of your comment.", "That's all cops", "Unfortunately he IS a cop. I helped him get the job in 2014. He\u2019s just looking at different departments.", "THIS. If he had been honest about the affair maybe this would have been different for him.", "I definitely wasn\u2019t trying to be petty or sabotage. I\u2019ve completely moved on from him which is why this whole thing caught me off guard in the first play. I was shocked he even listed me to be honest.", "And it should probably be reported to his current dept \ud83e\udd14", "Sadly he is. Just not with this new department. I helped him get on at his current department while we were married. Hindsight here.", "This is a good idea. Thank you!", "\u201cOh hello, consequences of my own actions\u2026\u201d\n\nNTA", "I actually dig into it. Apparently it was a requirement on the department\u2019s application to list any ex spouses along with current significant others. Who knew. Not me! \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I definitely didn\u2019t know. Apparently he was required to list me as an ex spouse per department policy.", "That feels petty but I\u2019m not opposed to it at this point \ud83d\ude02", "My boyfriend and I thought about this. Neither my ex husband nor his girlfriend know where we live. I got the shared house in the divorce because he couldn\u2019t afford it on his own and I could (also got the dog and truck, living a country song here). We sold the house 2 years ago and moved. A restraining order provides them with our home address.", "Definitely. Include the girlfriend if possible.", "Absolutely false.  She said her information was hearsay.  She did not report it as fact.  And the question was whether she would trust him and the answer was no and she shared why.  It was up to the department to decide whether or how to verify, believe or rely on this information.  \n\nLook at you affirmatively stating why the question was asked and how it should have been answered as narrowly as possible to protect the very type of person they are trying to discover by asking ex spouses this question.", "You really think we need more police officers who cheat on their wives, demand their ex-wives lie to the police, and then harass their ex-wives for telling the truth?? WTF.", "Oof. Welp, you certainly don\u2019t owe him anything further regardless!", "You would even be NTA to reach out to his current agency and let them know he\u2019s lying on applications to other agencies\u2026 that\u2019s a huge integrity issue.", "All cops are bastards. You married their king.", "It's not like you went out of your way and lied about it saying he was worse on purpose. You told the truth about it, which is exactly what they were looking for by calling his ex wife for different perspectives on topics. Not your fault if he made that truth an unfortunate one.", "Yeah, your ex is a major AH.", "My ex-husband did the same. Only he'd cheated as a security guard on a college campus with students. So that detail tanked his application.", "Please update on this!! And definitely NTA fuck that guy", "It\u2019s not petty, those cops are harassing you.", "Oh not petty at all.  He's mad at you for not lying.  Go for it", "If they are on the police-force they can easily find where you live.  You can request they not know your address as part of the protective order.  I would speak to an attorney.", "they could easily find out where she lives but unfortunately for him and the girlfriend it is actually against law enforcement policy to look up personal information like that unless its for a case if they look up her address through the department they could face loosing there jobs there shields and possibly criminal charges as well so I say let them dig themselves a huge whole they can't dig out of"]}
