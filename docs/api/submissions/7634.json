No carbon monoxide, no ghosts, no-one else living in the house (I could only wish my house was big enough or soundproof enough for that to be possible!), no gas-lighting, and probably no serious illness either.\n\nThe camera itself was a complete failure. Between how infrequently the issues happen, me trying to be discrete, and me just forgetting to use it (yes, I\u2019m aware of the irony), I have not yet managed to capture any of my forgetting instances. However, when I came to take my medication one day, I saw I hadn\u2019t taken it the day before. I remember silencing the alarm I have for taking it, I remember going in with the intention of taking it, but no memory after that. It was too much to think my husband was somehow getting hold of another pack of my prescription medication to set this up, so it *had* to be me forgetting.\n\nBut the comments here made me realise why I was entertaining the thought at all \u2013 my husband was not reacting with what I considered the appropriate level of concern. In fact, he was actively downplaying everything. So, I sat down with him to discuss it.\n\nApparently, from his point of view, nothing has changed in what I\u2019m doing, just in how I\u2019m reacting to it. He says I\u2019ve always been absent-minded (he says it\u2019s a personality trait, not a symptom), but in the past I\u2019d be \u201cOh did I? Sorry,\u201d and now I\u2019m \u201cI don\u2019t remember that. There must be something wrong!\u201d He knows that I\u2019m already being treated for depression / anxiety, so he thought the best thing to do was try to calm me down. He didn\u2019t realise it was having the opposite effect. He\u2019s willing to support me in anything I want to do, but it\u2019s clear he\u2019s convinced it\u2019s nothing to worry about. His certainty rocked my certainty.\n\nAnd\u2026 my doctor agrees with him. The doctor is arranging for blood tests to make sure, but he says he expects the problems will largely clear up when I\u2019m a little further into my course (sertraline, for the curious). We\u2019ll see, but \"probably nothing to worry about\".\n\nThank you to everyone for your concern and suggestions, and the YTA did help me back off before taking a step that could have damaged my relationship forever. I am grateful for having a place I could talk this out when I had no one else I felt I could speak to. Your help has meant the world to me.\n\n**Edit to clarify:** The camera mentioned here is a small, portable camera I've been carrying with me and recording myself with.

I don't know if this will help put you at ease or not, but I found that until I settled into it I was all over the place mentally, I forgot to do things at work, it would take me an hour to walk home (20 minute walk) and I couldn't remember why, I would almost immediately forget conversations. Basically, my brain was a seive. I'm no longer on Sertraline as it had other, more negative, side effects for me once I did settle into it, but from what I can remember, it sounds like the 'brain fog' as such that you're experiencing is relatively normal when you're getting used to the medication. I hope it eases up for you soon!", "I\u2019m glad to see an update.

I have been on and off Sertraline for a few years.

One was putting keys on a metal, clip-on hook. The moment she took the key out of the ignition, she'd hook it on her purse, or do it directly after unlocking the front door. No locking the keys in the car anymore, no losing them all over the house.\n\nShe actually started singing some stuff after watching The Long Kiss Goodnight ([like 39ish seconds in, as an example ](https://youtu.be/HA-DMoHW1uo)) which actually worked. I don't sing but I *will* say some stuff outloud, such as \"I'm putting the folder on the counter\" or whatever.\n\nBut of god am I glad for alarms on cell phones. I need to take quite a few medications, 3 times a day, and without cell phone alarms I would be lost. I don't forget just because of my ADHD (which my doctors aren't comfortable medicating me for in combination with the other meds I'm on. It sucks) but my physical health problems and medication side effects can mess with my memory.", "So glad it wasn't anything dangerous or malicious!\n\nKeep in mind though that if you decided your medication isn't working for you in a few months, you can ask your mental healthcare provider about trying something else. It took me a handful of tries before we found a combo that didn't give me major brain fog. Best of luck to you!!", "God sertraline absolutely fucked me *up*. Turned me into a total zombie. I was on a micro MICRO dose, and would constantly be awake for hours without being awake. It was completely regular for me to phase back into reality while doing something dangerous like chopping vegetables. It\u2019s a wonder I\u2019ve got all my fingers. \n\nOnce my old roommate bought a kayak and had it sitting in our living room. Apparently I stepped right over it, insisted I was dreaming because bananas don\u2019t get that big when it was pointed out to me, made tea, and turned back around just to yell \u201choly shit how long has THAT been there?!\u201d \n\nHope you get things straightened out! It didn\u2019t work for me but I hope it works out for you!", "My mates currently on sertraline and while she's feeling better generally that she has in years, she's also getting random brain fogs and short circuits on her memory.

See a second doctor, if you can. Because women die all the time from preventable causes because a doctor went \"Nah, you're fine.\" Unfortunately, it is a thing for them to brush off genuine symptoms and concerns because they came from a woman.\n\nSignificant changes in memory are generally a warning sign that something is wrong. And I know your husband says you've always been like that, but then I'd be questioning why he only started bringing it up recently - because it sounds like you're *very* forgetful.It could be the medication you're on, if that's something you've only taken for a few months. It could be early onset dementia. It could be ADHD. It could be a *lot* of things, or it could be nothing.

Most women are underdiagnosed because our symptoms present differently than men. I also have anxiety and depression. They all have overlapping symptoms, so it is difficult to diagnose. Do some research and talk to your husband about what you find out because he will more than likely see more of the symptoms than you think about yourself. I have done everything you have done in both posts. Forgot taking meds, forgot to use something I specifically bought for something, left food out, left the oven and stove on, etc. Do you also drink alot of coffee or caffinated drinks or have a tendency to get focused on something and have a hard time stepping away from it?", "Hooray for boring updates! I think we were all a bit worried about you because it was such a stressful and mysterious situation, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re at least starting to get some answers, though I\u2019m sorry the memory problems persist and are still impacting your daily life, that definitely sucks! I wish you all the best!", "i'm glad you talked this out, and a minor suggestion i have in your talk with a doctor might be looking into depression causing short-term memory loss, it's one of the less talked about and lesser known symptoms of depression, which really sucks because it can be one of the worse symptoms", "Hey, so since your first post mentions you're in your mid 40s I'd suggest you join us at the r/menopause board and see if anything else rings a bell. Perimenopause can cause forgetfulness and it can make you irritable or anxious or depressed (and if you already had those, it can really ramp it up). Along with a bunch of other oh so lovely symptoms.\n\nBad news is most doctors don't even mention it as a possible cause of these issues and downplay it if they do. They seem to think its just hot flashes and nothing else. \n\nAnyway, good luck!", "ADHD? Depression and anxiety are often combined with that diagnosis, and it would explain a lot.", "What you are describing sounds like textbook ADHD, plewse get tested if you haven't done that already! Not every psychiatrist \"believes\" in adult ADHD (which is stupid, because you don't grow out of it), but it's actually quite common for girls/women to not be diagnosed in childhood. And untreated ADHD can lead to low self esteem, anxiety and depression.\n\nsource: I got diagnosed at 26", "I was hoping you'd update! I really thought you were being manipulated. As for the Sertraline I tried it a few years ago and hated it, I felt jittery and juddery and was in a 'fog' and I just felt angry and tense all the time. I spoke with the GP and she switched me to Mirtazipine and I've had no side effects at all and feel much better. No fog, no forgetfulness and the angry/tense feeling went away. Its not a sleeping pill but one of the side effects is feeling tired after taking it. So taking it before bed is ideal and I get a really good sleep.\n\nI just thought I'd mention it if it turns out Sertaline is the issue.\n\nI hope everything works out well for you! As the other comments say you can get an app that you can check off a list you've made. Like turned off oven? Check. Locked the back door? Check. Fed the dog?  Check etc, at least until things have settled and you've had your tests. Good luck!!", "Omg. Do you have a link for that?

I feel like we\u2019ve been conditioned to think the worst here.", "Not exactly, I got a little dictaphone-style camera and started recording myself doing things when I was alone. When I remembered :D. Lots of footage of me cleaning the kitchen, cooking, and now, taking my medication, but still managed to miss the one time I did forget to switch off the oven. From what other people have said about ADHD 'tricks', I suspect the fact that I was using the camera at all made me more likely to remember to do everything.", "Doctor has booked me for a set of blood screens, so he isn't completely ignoring me.\n\nAbout the frequency, I excluded a bit due to word limit, but my husband said this was a combination of co-incidence and me paying an unusual amount of attention to it and remembering how often it's happening. For most things he says he doesn't bother saying anything - if I leave out a jar of peanut butter, or something non-perishable, or my laptop in the bathroom, for instance. He only says something if it's 'dangerous', and that I go through cycles. The forgetting of the oven / hob is just something I've started getting worse about lately, so he's been speaking up more.\n\nHe reminded me of when, after we had a new alarm installed, I went through a few weeks of occasianally leaving my keys in the door before adapting. That was years ago. I just hadn't associated the two because that hadn't felt like something was 'wrong' the way it has been lately.\n\n(Edited to correct orphaned pronouns)", "I didn't spy on my husband at all. I only used the camera when I was alone.", "That's very clever - I'll look into that, thanks!", "I do the same things! Everything has one specific place it belongs or I WILL lose it. When I need to remember something, I focus on something visually or say something weird out loud so later I can be like \"yeah I did do that because that's when I said that weird thing\" or when I look at that spot, my brain gets connected to that thing I had to remember to do. If I'm afraid I'll forget to bring something I need, I put it right in front of the door so I HAVE to pick it up before leaving the house. I am very forgetful. I probably won't get good at remembering things but I've figured some stuff out to manage life as a forgetful person", "That\u2019s really cool and I think a good compromise that let you record stuff without violating your husbands privacy. \n\nI have ADHD and yeah, recording or keeping/referring to notes would definitely be something that brings you back to the present and focus more on your actions.", "Except it was your husbands house as well no? Did he know the camera was there?", "I was diagnosed well into adulthood with ADHD, too.  It is an interesting note that men and women's symptoms tend to be somewhat different (or perhaps we verbalize it differently).  I guess I'm lucky that I found ways of figuring these things out without a doctor or parent to guide me.  It's nice that you had someone to help you along.", "So glad everything turned out this way. I went through the last 2 months wondering if I had dementia. I am diagnosed with ADHD and I am medicated for it. so I didn't think that it was related. It seemed so much worse than the normal every now and then forgot this or lost that. I went to the doctor who sent me to a neurologist and a thyroid specialist and talked with my psychiatrist about the meds. I was so sure that my mind was going... turns out everything's perfect just had to tweak the meds twice.\n\nETA I've been singing little songs to myself to remember things I did not know other people did that.", "I'm seeing such a reflection of all my coping mechanisms here! Lol.  It's nice to see people who work the same as me.", "Women are still underdiagnosed because of presenting differently and that's sad as hell. It's still better than how many women are underdiagnosed for autism, though. That's just plain enraging.\n\nI know just how lucky I was to have her because I know I would have struggled so much without it. It meant avoiding the terrible self-esteem that so many people with ADHD have. I was lucky to have her, in so many ways.", "Great to hear this.\n\nI am VERY forgetful. I have reminders on top of reminders.  But honestly the only thing that really helps me are lists - things I have dead front and centre, and that I cross off once the task is done.  Because I know that for me, intent doesn\u2019t matter - I\u2019ll intend sincerity to do a dozen things, but in the end, only half of them get done without the incentive of my list.\n\nGlad it all worked out with your husband and finding the issue.

Partial complex seizures aka temporal lobe seizures can include physical activity during the seizure that is forgotten. ADHD doesn't cause this degree of memory loss.

I also made myself form a habit of making a physical or visual check that I have the key before closing the car door. Or sometimes I'll lock it with the fob button so I know I have the key and I watched myself lock the door", "Agreed.  I was diagnosed ADHD in my 30\u2019s and just realized I\u2019m also autistic a year ago.  A big part of the issue though is that until relatively recently, can\u2019t remember the date but it was a few years after my ADHD diagnosis, so approximately 10 years, they didn\u2019t realize that not only is it possible to be both ADHD and autistic, it\u2019s super common.  And up until a few years after that, doctors weren\u2019t ALLOWED to diagnose ADHD and autism both, they had to pick one or the other.", "I haven't been checked (I know, I should) but I wouldn't be surprised if I have ADHD, Anxiety, Autism and either depression or bipolar. There's a lot that goes in with my head", "I'm think I'm autistic as well, which I've suspected for a couple years but started *highly* suspecting it for a couple months now (I'll be totally honest, it was a video on Star Trek and neurodivergency- specifically autism, since the creator is autistic- that described things I've thought and experienced all my life by could never properly articulate. I don't think I've cried harder in my entire life). But if someone met me and had to pick between ADHD and autism, they would definitely pick ADHD. Especially if they also met my mom, lol.", "Self diagnosis is completely valid, there\u2019s so many barriers to diagnosis as an adult, and risks involved with getting an official diagnosis, at least where autism is considered.  I would start by reading books on both, following neurodivergent social media creators, and, while they do not constitute a diagnosis, there are a lot of online self assessments that are VERY effective at pinpointing whether or not it\u2019s likely that you are neurodivergent.  Many of them, like the RAADSR, are actually commonly used as part of official diagnostic assessments", "I also have anxiety and depression, and suspect I'm also autistic, lol. A lot of things that can be comorbid, basically.", "Glad it\u2019s nothing like carbon monoxide or your husband gaslighting you. Anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds can absolutely wreak havoc on you while your body is adjusting. I know mine did! Make sure your husband knows to watch out for any odd behavior, as it could be a bad side effect and you may need to try a different medication. It\u2019s a lot of hit and miss with mood medications. And be sure to stay consistent on the dosing, as withdrawals can be brutal. They can range from severe mood swings and headaches to life-threatening, depending on the med.

Your update made me think of that. It's reassuring that your husband was simply acting in a way that he thought would be beneficial to you. How nice.
