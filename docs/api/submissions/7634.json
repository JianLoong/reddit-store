No carbon monoxide, no ghosts, no-one else living in the house (I could only wish my house was big enough or soundproof enough for that to be possible!), no gas-lighting, and probably no serious illness either.\n\nThe camera itself was a complete failure. Between how infrequently the issues happen, me trying to be discrete, and me just forgetting to use it (yes, I\u2019m aware of the irony), I have not yet managed to capture any of my forgetting instances. However, when I came to take my medication one day, I saw I hadn\u2019t taken it the day before. I remember silencing the alarm I have for taking it, I remember going in with the intention of taking it, but no memory after that. It was too much to think my husband was somehow getting hold of another pack of my prescription medication to set this up, so it *had* to be me forgetting.\n\nBut the comments here made me realise why I was entertaining the thought at all \u2013 my husband was not reacting with what I considered the appropriate level of concern. In fact, he was actively downplaying everything. So, I sat down with him to discuss it.\n\nApparently, from his point of view, nothing has changed in what I\u2019m doing, just in how I\u2019m reacting to it. He says I\u2019ve always been absent-minded (he says it\u2019s a personality trait, not a symptom), but in the past I\u2019d be \u201cOh did I? Sorry,\u201d and now I\u2019m \u201cI don\u2019t remember that. There must be something wrong!\u201d He knows that I\u2019m already being treated for depression / anxiety, so he thought the best thing to do was try to calm me down. He didn\u2019t realise it was having the opposite effect. He\u2019s willing to support me in anything I want to do, but it\u2019s clear he\u2019s convinced it\u2019s nothing to worry about. His certainty rocked my certainty.\n\nAnd\u2026 my doctor agrees with him. The doctor is arranging for blood tests to make sure, but he says he expects the problems will largely clear up when I\u2019m a little further into my course (sertraline, for the curious). We\u2019ll see, but \"probably nothing to worry about\".\n\nThank you to everyone for your concern and suggestions, and the YTA did help me back off before taking a step that could have damaged my relationship forever. I am grateful for having a place I could talk this out when I had no one else I felt I could speak to. Your help has meant the world to me.", "created_utc": 1674032520, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10f2quk/update_wibta_for_putting_a_camera_in_the_kitchen/", "score": 104, "replies": ["I love \"boring\" updates, because it usually means things are going as well as they can be! I'm sorry you're fighting anxiety and depression, I know how difficult that can be. I'm really glad you were able to communicate so well with your husband.\n\nNot to make light of your situation, but I couldn't help but smile at the pill uncertainty. I have phone alarms set all over. I've walked towards my prescription, practically chanting \"take your med,\" only to not remember if I actually took it. I joke that my auto pilot failed. \n\nThere's lids you can buy that go on your prescription bottles, and it has a timer built in to show when you last opened it. I thought I should mention it, in case it could help.", "Hello, former Sertraline taker here! I don't know if this will help put you at ease or not, but I found that until I settled into it I was all over the place mentally, I forgot to do things at work, it would take me an hour to walk home (20 minute walk) and I couldn't remember why, I would almost immediately forget conversations. Basically, my brain was a seive. I'm no longer on Sertraline as it had other, more negative, side effects for me once I did settle into it, but from what I can remember, it sounds like the 'brain fog' as such that you're experiencing is relatively normal when you're getting used to the medication. I hope it eases up for you soon!", "I\u2019m glad to see an update. You\u2019re original post really stuck in my mind.  \n\nSo you did end up setting up a camera? \n\nI\u2019m glad you have a supportive husband.", "The first few weeks on sertraline I was a mess!! Forgetting things, or doing stuff and having no memory of it, being very emotional. If I forget to take my pill for more than 2 days it still happens. It stopped happening once my body was used to the med. The fog will clear. Just keep taking it every day! Glad to hear that it wasnt anything serious though! \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb", "As long as it isn't bad news, it's good news.", "There are actually loads of things you can do when you pinpoint the areas you are forgetful.  I'm like the OP, thinking I did things I didn't or vice versa.  I had to train myself away from it and set up special systems in my house for myself (giant keyhook by the door so I don't lose my keys anymore, prescriptions go in a box with the dates marked, I say out loud \"I locked the door\" to be sure I did it, I have nest cams to be able to check I didn't leave a window open or something).\n\nYou just have to keep trying things until you find things that work, then in a few years sometimes a new thing when that stops working.\n\nBut yeah, it's nice to see a boring update.", "Yep, I can also confirm. I have been on and off Sertraline for a few years. Every time I start up the course I'd experience a few weeks of brain fog until it settles to a mild form of muffling for the anxiety chatter in my head.\n\nI found being stoned to be quite frustrating as I would experience a similar kind of brain fog during and after.", "I'm glad my mom figured out some systems before my own ADHD kicked up a notch during puberty (she was actually diagnosed until shortly before I was, when she was nearly 50). One was putting keys on a metal, clip-on hook. The moment she took the key out of the ignition, she'd hook it on her purse, or do it directly after unlocking the front door. No locking the keys in the car anymore, no losing them all over the house.\n\nShe actually started singing some stuff after watching The Long Kiss Goodnight ([like 39ish seconds in, as an example ](https://youtu.be/HA-DMoHW1uo)) which actually worked. I don't sing but I *will* say some stuff outloud, such as \"I'm putting the folder on the counter\" or whatever.\n\nBut of god am I glad for alarms on cell phones. I need to take quite a few medications, 3 times a day, and without cell phone alarms I would be lost. I don't forget just because of my ADHD (which my doctors aren't comfortable medicating me for in combination with the other meds I'm on. It sucks) but my physical health problems and medication side effects can mess with my memory."]}
