I have always been under the impression that the babysitter is allowed to have a reasonable amount of dinner if they're expected to serve dinner. I've babysat a few times in the past and have never encountered this.\n\nWhen the parents came home to relieve me they asked how tonight went. I said fine, and said that the pizza place was really good as I had never ordered from there before. Mom looked at me puzzled, and asked why I ate the kids dinner. I said I just had two pieces of pizza and a breadstick. I feel as if this was not an inappropriate amount to eat. However, the parents disagreed. Dad said that they didn't expect to have to feed me dinner as well, and told me not to eat their family's food. \n\nOverall, I am very uncomfortable and confused by this experience. Both boys were fed, and did not complain about being hungry for the rest of the night.

In that case, I think it could be possible that you would pay for whatever they wanted and then you would buy your own food with your own money if you so chose. \n\nI think in that case, they should specify whether you could buy your own food with that money as well.

I\u2019d avoid babysitting for them again", "NTA, but they are. This is a huge red flag to not work for these people again. Seriously. What gripe will they have next? Because they will.\n\nAs a parent, I was so grateful for good sitters, and 100% okay with sitters enjoying the meal with my kids.\n\nImagine the other way. If you'd ordered delectable pizza to eat in front of the kids and hadn't shared with them, I imagine they would correctly think that wasn't cool, but you can't be expected to feed their kids, per their logic, and you have a right to eat dinner.", "NTA and never babysit for them again.", "NTA\n\nI have a feeling that if you clocked out to take a break and get your own dinner they wouldn\u2019t have been happy with that either, right? So wtf are they actually expecting from you?", "NTA. And definitely don't sit for them again.", "NTA. If I ever had someone watching my kids not only would they be welcome to food I ordered for the evening I usually let them know they could help them selves to snacks or beverages that were available, within reason of course, but no one ever took advantage...these people are tight wads, I would turn down future offers from them.", "NTA. if someone is babysitting kids and giving them dinner, they should be able to eat as well. Are they supposed to leave and go pick some up or something?", "NTA oh my goodness. I was a kid who was frequently babysat and my parents ALWAYS fed the sitter if it was a ordering food in situation. Don\u2019t sit for these people and warn other sitters. Those poor kids.", "NTA\n\nIt always amazes me... the parents trust you with their children's well being and lives.. but not with food. I'm sure if you sat eating nothing the boys would have asked if you were hungry and why weren't you eating with them.", "NTA. You always feed the babysitter. Don\u2019t work for people like this.", "I don't get it. Didn't you and the parents talk before they left? Food (you and the kids) usually comes up in this talks alongside of evening and bedtime routine. Or is it common nowadays that you have a complete stranger watching your kids and you don't even bother to talk to them for 2 minutes? Thats so weird.", "They are incredibly rude, the way they said it to OP was so awful. I had such crippling social anxiety when I was that age that if someone had said to me \u201cWhy did you eat the kids dinner\u201d and \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to have to feed you dinner as well, don\u2019t eat my family\u2019s food\u201d I would have been so mortified and upset I\u2019d have probably never babysat again for anyone and those words would be burned into my brain for years. What awful people.", "Agreed, I have always nannied and babysat - the expectation was always that I was welcome to whatever food was being served / at the home. I even was an au pair in Spain and never felt limited as to the food I consumed at the home. \n\nNTA, the parents are inconsiderate and rude.", "This. I can\u2019t imagine not feeding my babysitter when I had one. I used to tell my (over 21) sitter to help herself to a glass of wine when the little was asleep.", "At that age the snacks and being treated like part of the family was part of the fun of the job.  These people are duds; dump them!  NTS", "Right? I know expenses are going up but it\u2019s pizza for crying out loud.", "Yeah I babysat as a teen and never had a family not offer food. Now as a mom when I bring in a babysitter it's usually after my daughter is in bed but I always ask \"have you eaten anything\" and offer dinner anyway. Food in the fridge and in the pantry cabinet are fair game for people I'm trusting to watch my kid so I can go enjoy the night out!", "You always feed the babysitter! It\u2019s SOP.", "Yes this seems the polite and considerate thing to do, not sure what\u2019s up with the OPs family she bay sat for. That family is to be avoided if OP can help it.", "There were leftovers!", "Also, to me it is normal to feed the one looking after your kids. Provide them with dinner and snacks. That is the least you can do (besides paying them). It\u2019s mostly young people trying to earn some extra cash. A bag of crisps/ chips and some soda or a pizza is not that expensive when you can pay for a babysitter.", "NTA- Parents always expected me to eat if I was to feed their children (I usually cooked the dinner) around 5 or 6pm. Maybe it is because babysitters are paid much compared to what I got when I babysat, but it is not uncommon. As long as the children had their fill, you should not go hungry. Did they expect you to pack a dinner?", "They're also setting a terrible example for their boys. \"Remember, kids, the hired help doesn't get to eat with you.\"", "I agree. People that are that petty and small minded over a slice of pizza will look for other ways to find trouble.", "I thought this very thing, sitter gets blamed for something that comes up missing, kid gets a bruise etc. I would avoid this family completely going forward.", "This! And please advise any of your friends and neighbors of your experience with them. Or at least talk about it with friends, loudly, near the town gossip. So no one else sits for them either.", "I agree. People that are that petty and small minded over a slice of pizza will look for other ways to find trouble.", ">NTA Cross them off your list\n\nI've learned this lesson the hard way. When you need the money, it's hard to turn down clients. But these types of clients just aren't worth it. They'll likely end up costing you money in the long run.", "How thoughtful of those parents! Truly, that is how it should be, NTA.\n\nI babysat a lot in my teen years for dozens of families and every single one made a point of offering up their fridge and pantry.", "I won't even go over there. I'd just send them the link to this thread.", "As a parent if for some reason there's food in the house that I don't want eaten (example, saving for specific occasion or kids school snacks, etc) I'll mention what it is and where it is, and then follow up with an explaination as to why, and a help yourself to anything else. If I was planning to order takeout, I would make sure I let the babysitter know what was ordered and that they could have some or scrounge my kitchen for something different if they preferred. \n\nAs a babysitter, I would consider it the norm that if you're babysitting over a meal that you'd get a share. I don't assume snacks are available because a lot of the people I babysat for were definitely living paycheck to paycheck, and often brought my own. \n\nSo no, you are absolutely NOT the ahole. Maybe if you're babysitting for a new client in the future, you could ask? Just say you've had some clients that expect you to eat with their kids and some that don't, so you want things to be clear to avoid issues??", "Never babysit for them again.  Period. They are not worthy of your services and the food conversation will just rile them up as they're obviously entitled AHs.", "Blacklist these people too, if they're like this over a couple slices of pizza imagine the pain in the arse they'll be further down the line \n\nOP NTA", "The ones you never babysit for again.", "Also, what else was OP meant to do? Bring their own dinner? And then get the whole \u201cwhat are you eating? How come we didn\u2019t get that?\u201d from the kids? What if her food was better? Would she get in trouble for not sharing/sharing without permission? What a load of rubbish.", "Exactly! As a mom, if my daughter would have told me that, I would have called those AH and chewed them out!", "You are not alone in your misread.", "Same tbh", "Yep.", "Did they expect Op to take a dinner break and leave the kids unsupervised to run to McD's? Morons.", "I had parents send me home with snacks because I didn\u2019t grab something out of the pantry after the kids were asleep. \ud83d\ude02", "I went over that a few times in my mind of what would've been appropriate to do. I arrived at 5:30 so I guess I could've eaten beforehand? I guess I'm not a parent but I would feel weirder about a sitter getting out my pots and pans than if she helped herself to whatever the kids were eating.", "NTA I babysat for a literal decade and always ate with the kids. If there was something the parents didn\u2019t want me to touch they would say so and I wouldn\u2019t eat or drink it, but I still always ate with the kids or was allowed to make myself something when the kids ate, this is weird.", "Same! They had a basket for my snacks. A happy, reliable sitter is priceless.", "Nope, same culture", "The dad also said to not eat the family\u2019s food. Both parents were TA.", "Im not sure about this .. work is work and if u go for a 4h shift then u shouldnt expect to be fed. Not saying that OP is the asshole, parents should communicate that better.", "Our sitter doesn't usually eat the pizza we offer, but I ALWAYS say \"we'll have pizza at the house that you are welcome to\" and set out 3 plates (we have 2 kits) so she knows she is welcome to anything. This is such an odd response from the parents.\n\nNTA", "I mean me saying the pizza was good was a small snippet of a larger conversation about how the night went.", "It sounds like making pleasant conversation, filling them in on how the evening went with the kids, and saying she enjoyed the pizza place as a nice point of chat related to what she did with the kids after what sounds like a relatively uneventful evening. Its similar to if she had said that they had a really nice backyard after telling them she played with the kids there, or that they had a really nice TV setup after watching some TV with the kids. It\u2019s weird to be attacked for making a pleasant comment about something she did with the kids as part of babysitting.", "Everything you said is wrong.", "Found the parents account", "I think we found the someone who doesn't understand why no one wants to be babysit their children a second time.", "What? I babysat a bunch as a teen, and the parents always told me to help myself to whatever.", "It\u2019s one thing if OP was eating them out of house and home, or if OP had eaten the entire pizza and left the children with no food, but neither of those things happened. I babysit pretty regularly and I\u2019ve worked as a nanny before, every parent I worked for told me that when making/getting food for their children, I should get something for myself too. That\u2019s the norm with most in-home babysitting jobs.\n\nIf the parents didn\u2019t want OP to eat the pizza, I personally think that they should have specifically said \u201cthis is *only* for the kids\u201d instead of leaving it up in the air for OP to assume.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an A H thing for OP to have eaten part of a meal, when they were never told not to. If anything this situation would be N A H.\nThough imo, this is a NTA situation purely because from OP\u2019s post it seems as though the parents weren\u2019t as mannered as they could have been given the fact that it was a miscommunication on both ends.\n\nETA: fixed a typo", "Please never hire a babysitter if you are a parent.", "Lol what?? This has never been a thing in babysitting.", "What whack-ass planet of entitlement are you from?", "You've never had an interaction with an actual human before have you?", "Oh honey, no. You\u2019re drunk and wrong.", "Yeah that would have crushed me when I was a teenage babysitter. I used to essentially short term nanny the kids up the street from me when I was 18 over the summer, weeks they didn't have summer camps and such lined up. The parents always told me I could eat whatever I wanted, and they had a garage refrigerator they kept abundantly stocked with sodas, popsicles, and tons of snacks. I was there weekdays from 8am - 6pm while the parents worked, so I cooked lunch and dinner for the kids, and always made myself a plate of whatever I cooked. Sometimes they'd give me spending money to drive the kids over to a McDonald's with a play place or order some pizzas and they'd make it clear they gave me enough for me to get a meal too. \n\nI cannot believe they're mad over a couple slices of pizza! That's truly ridiculous, and if they really had rules like that they should have told OP upfront that they were expected to bring a lunch/not have anything from the house.", "No joke! Utterly disgusted by those people!", "Me too!  I would\u2019ve taken it a lot harder than OP did. What grown ass adults say that to their 20 yr old babysitter? \n\nAlso, OP doesn\u2019t say how long the babysitting job was, but I\u2019ve been a babysitter for some long jobs, think 4 or 5 pm until well after midnight. Depending on how long the job was, the family might be even shittier to expect OP not to eat anything.", "I know! And TWO pieces from a pizza they were already ordering for their kids. Unbelievable.", "That makes this even worse. I could maybe understand if you finished the pizza while the kids were asking for more food but everyone was feed and there were slices left. \n\nAvoid that couple", "You did nothing wrong at all. Don\u2019t babysit for them anymore. NTA", "I baby sat for over twenty years. Only had one weird family like this. They are rude and treating you like less than. Don't work for them again unless they paid well but the one I had like that were penny pinchers wanting me to arrive early so they could finish getting ready but not pay me for it because they were there. I was experienced enough to advocate for myself but if it had been earlier in my career I would have probably just ditched them", "There was still pizza left over and they were annoyed that you ***gasp*** ate 2 slices?! \n\nNTA, it\u2019s ridiculous and petty to make those comments over 2 slices of pizza, the kids were clearly full so it\u2019s not like you were taking food away from them. What next, they complain about you using their water if you needed a drink? \n\nEvery time I\u2019ve ever babysat I\u2019ve been told \u201chelp yourself to food or drinks, the snacks are in that cupboard\u201d, most people if left money to get a pizza in that situation would presume it would be okay to have a slice or two with the kids, it\u2019s not like you ordered yourself a whole large pizza with all the toppings to yourself.", "NTA They are AHs, cut them loose", "NTA \n\nWow\u2026 the parents are.\n\nAnytime I watched children, I was told \u201chelp yourself\u201d bc I was also feeding the children.\nWhen I hired sitters, I made sure they had their own snacks, drinks, & food  if they were going to fix a meal for the kids.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. I wouldn\u2019t work for them again.", "NTA. I would second the suggestion of being cautious of taking job offers from them. You didn\u2019t eat the whole pizza and left the kids hungry. And it sounds like you were being polite about getting to try it.  People like this can be weird and I wouldn\u2019t put it past them if they docked you pay in the future for something like that.", "They are nutters, you tasted food which children eat which is entirely sensible and normal.   Its safer that you check the food is fine to eat, total nonsense to complain about.  Ive worked catering retail and production, never presume its all perfect every time. \n   Dont go back there imo unless they are paying double for the privilege", "Were they not expecting you to eat or to order a whole pizza for yourself? NTA.", "NTA.  When I babysat, I definitely ate food there, same if I was housesitting for someone.  I haven't done either in a long time but if I had someone babysitting my child I would fully expect them to eat my food, especially if I had a pizza ordered.\n\nIf I were you I would avoid that family and not work for them again.", "As a former babysitter, this is reason enough for you to be *their former babysitter.* how dare they think that you wouldn\u2019t eat dinner at dinner time??", "Did you show up with a second shift lunch pail? The fuck did they think you were gonna eat while you were there? I would never do this to a babysitter.", "If they contacted you through anywhere that you can leave a review, please leave one. If you don't want the babysitter to eat with the kids you inform them beforehand so they can bring their own food or just decline to babysit for you. \n\nI always thought that if you've got a babysitter they eat with the kids and you make sure there are plenty of snacks for when the little ones are in bed.", "I don't have kids. But I remember being a kid and having babysitters. If my brother and I ate, so did they.", "I always thought it was the norm too. In the 90s they used to always joke about it on shows. I mean come on if she was thirsty were they going to not let her have water?", "Ew. Yeah you are so right!", "I think the nanny family used my daughter to clean up their children diets, no pizza, no macaroni and cheese, no process nuggets, it was grilled chicken/ fish, rice or potato, several vegetables and fruits. Either way it was very kind of the family to consider my what my daughter could and couldn\u2019t eat.", "No, send them a link to their state\u2019s labor laws. In my state I am entitled to a meal break after five hours of work. I\u2019m entitled to a paid meal break if I\u2019m required to stay on-duty.", "Agreed, she should just send the link lol.\n\nSomehow I think these parents know they\u2019re rude and cheap though, and just bullying OP because they\u2019re assholes.", "Totally this! Our babysitters are welcome to pretty much anything and I make that clear, and show them where the snacks and drinks are. One of my kids has autism so I meal prep a lot since he\u2019s a picky eater, so I will let them know about those few items specifically.  I always put a note on them in the fridge anyways because my husband forgets what specifically is for our son and will eat it when he\u2019s starving and comes home from work. I\u2019ve never had an issue at all with sitters and food. So ridiculous.", "Agreed - next they\u2019ll be accusing OP of stealing jewelry or something", "And let your friends know if any of them babysit.", "Exactly", "Yup", "That's such a good point!

This couple is kooky.\n\nDon't sit for them again.\n\nNta.", "I mean, as a parent my instinct is to make sure kids and guests get fed.

Why order such a large pizza if it isn't for you as well as the children?", "I agree. Don\u2019t babysit for them again. That\u2019s some weird af behavior from the parents.
