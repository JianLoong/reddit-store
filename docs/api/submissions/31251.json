I've babysat a few times in the past and have never encountered this.\n\nWhen the parents came home to relieve me they asked how tonight went. I said fine, and said that the pizza place was really good as I had never ordered from there before. Mom looked at me puzzled, and asked why I ate the kids dinner. I said I just had two pieces of pizza and a breadstick. I feel as if this was not an inappropriate amount to eat. However, the parents disagreed. Dad said that they didn't expect to have to feed me dinner as well, and told me not to eat their family's food. \n\nOverall, I am very uncomfortable and confused by this experience. Both boys were fed, and did not complain about being hungry for the rest of the night.

In that case, I think it could be possible that you would pay for whatever they wanted and then you would buy your own food with your own money if you so chose. \n\nI think in that case, they should specify whether you could buy your own food with that money as well.  I feel like most people in that circumstance would.

That\u2019s really weird they\u2019d have this take. We\u2019ve luckily never had to hire a babysitter as we have a ton of family around, but if we did, the first thing I\u2019d ask is what food they\u2019d like to eat as well.

If you'd ordered delectable pizza to eat in front of the kids and hadn't shared with them, I imagine they would correctly think that wasn't cool, but you can't be expected to feed their kids, per their logic, and you have a right to eat dinner.", "NTA and never babysit for them again.", "NTA\n\nI have a feeling that if you clocked out to take a break and get your own dinner they wouldn\u2019t have been happy with that either, right? So wtf are they actually expecting from you?", "NTA. And definitely don't sit for them again.", "NTA. If I ever had someone watching my kids not only would they be welcome to food I ordered for the evening I usually let them know they could help them selves to snacks or beverages that were available, within reason of course, but no one ever took advantage...these people are tight wads, I would turn down future offers from them.", "NTA. if someone is babysitting kids and giving them dinner, they should be able to eat as well. Are they supposed to leave and go pick some up or something?", "NTA oh my goodness. I was a kid who was frequently babysat and my parents ALWAYS fed the sitter if it was a ordering food in situation. Don\u2019t sit for these people and warn other sitters. Those poor kids.", "NTA\n\nIt always amazes me... the parents trust you with their children's well being and lives.. but not with food.

Don\u2019t work for people like this.", "I don't get it. Didn't you and the parents talk before they left? Food (you and the kids) usually comes up in this talks alongside of evening and bedtime routine. Or is it common nowadays that you have a complete stranger watching your kids and you don't even bother to talk to them for 2 minutes? Thats so weird.", "They are incredibly rude, the way they said it to OP was so awful. I had such crippling social anxiety when I was that age that if someone had said to me \u201cWhy did you eat the kids dinner\u201d and \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to have to feed you dinner as well, don\u2019t eat my family\u2019s food\u201d I would have been so mortified and upset I\u2019d have probably never babysat again for anyone and those words would be burned into my brain for years. What awful people.", "Agreed, I have always nannied and babysat - the expectation was always that I was welcome to whatever food was being served / at the home. I even was an au pair in Spain and never felt limited as to the food I consumed at the home. \n\nNTA, the parents are inconsiderate and rude.", "This. I can\u2019t imagine not feeding my babysitter when I had one. I used to tell my (over 21) sitter to help herself to a glass of wine when the little was asleep.", "At that age the snacks and being treated like part of the family was part of the fun of the job.  These people are duds; dump them!  NTS", "Right? I know expenses are going up but it\u2019s pizza for crying out loud.", "Yeah I babysat as a teen and never had a family not offer food. Now as a mom when I bring in a babysitter it's usually after my daughter is in bed but I always ask \"have you eaten anything\" and offer dinner anyway.

That family is to be avoided if OP can help it.", "There were leftovers!", "Also, to me it is normal to feed the one looking after your kids. Provide them with dinner and snacks. That is the least you can do (besides paying them). It\u2019s mostly young people trying to earn some extra cash. A bag of crisps/ chips and some soda or a pizza is not that expensive when you can pay for a babysitter.", "NTA- Parents always expected me to eat if I was to feed their children (I usually cooked the dinner) around 5 or 6pm. Maybe it is because babysitters are paid much compared to what I got when I babysat, but it is not uncommon. As long as the children had their fill, you should not go hungry. Did they expect you to pack a dinner?", "They're also setting a terrible example for their boys. \"Remember, kids, the hired help doesn't get to eat with you.\"", "I agree. People that are that petty and small minded over a slice of pizza will look for other ways to find trouble.", "I thought this very thing, sitter gets blamed for something that comes up missing, kid gets a bruise etc. I would avoid this family completely going forward.", "This! And please advise any of your friends and neighbors of your experience with them. Or at least talk about it with friends, loudly, near the town gossip. So no one else sits for them either.", "I agree.

If I was planning to order takeout, I would make sure I let the babysitter know what was ordered and that they could have some or scrounge my kitchen for something different if they preferred. \n\nAs a babysitter, I would consider it the norm that if you're babysitting over a meal that you'd get a share. I don't assume snacks are available because a lot of the people I babysat for were definitely living paycheck to paycheck, and often brought my own. \n\nSo no, you are absolutely NOT the ahole.

Its similar to if she had said that they had a really nice backyard after telling them she played with the kids there, or that they had a really nice TV setup after watching some TV with the kids.

I babysit pretty regularly and I\u2019ve worked as a nanny before, every parent I worked for told me that when making/getting food for their children, I should get something for myself too.

I used to essentially short term nanny the kids up the street from me when I was 18 over the summer, weeks they didn't have summer camps and such lined up. The parents always told me I could eat whatever I wanted, and they had a garage refrigerator they kept abundantly stocked with sodas, popsicles, and tons of snacks. I was there weekdays from 8am - 6pm while the parents worked, so I cooked lunch and dinner for the kids, and always made myself a plate of whatever I cooked. Sometimes they'd give me spending money to drive the kids over to a McDonald's with a play place or order some pizzas and they'd make it clear they gave me enough for me to get a meal too. \n\nI cannot believe they're mad over a couple slices of pizza!
