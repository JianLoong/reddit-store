I'm a lesbian and was definitely not interested, but it was a relatively conservative area and I didn't feel like getting hate-crimed that afternoon. The guy was honestly not being that creepy in the moment, but I've had a bunch of uncomfortable and scary interactions with men trying to hit on me in the past, and on top of my sexual orientation the interaction made me uncomfortable and nervous. I didn't want to give him my name, and most of the interaction was me giggling and telling him that I was drunk, trying to think of a way to get him to go away. At some point he asked my name again and I said \"my name is Jack, Jack Mehoff\".\n\nAfter that I got up and told him I was going back to my family who was hanging out nearby. They saw the whole interaction and commented about it, and mentioned that he had also hit on my sister at the bar earlier. I told them about what I said, and they didn't really say anything. \n\nThe next day they told me I was a major asshole and super immature for saying that, and that  I probably hurt his feelings because he was probably a socially awkward guy, and I should have respectively said I wasn't interested. I really don't think I did anything that bad, but we got in a small argument about it.\n\nMost of my friends don't think it was that bad, especially since he was hitting on multiple people anyway, but a couple did say it could be asshole-ish in certain contexts.\nI know this is a really stupid and superficial situation, but am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1689163301, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xmle5/aita_for_telling_a_guy_a_that_was_hitting_on_me/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just such an incredibly minor act that he\u2019s unlikely to have serious hurt feelings and if he does, that\u2019s on him not you.", "\" I probably hurt his feelings\"\n\nI'll put that up there with \"boys will be boys\" for expressions that excuse away abusive/intrusive male behavior.  You were clearly unwelcoming to him during the interaction and he continued to hit on you.  He got what he deserved, IMHO.", "Sounds like an invitation to me", "NTA. The way that some people infantilize men when it comes to HOW they should get rejected is absolutely wild. What even makes anyone assume that he's socially awkward and has hurt feelings? This wasn't even a mean or hurtful way to reject him.", "NTA. He was bothering you while you were alone. You were polite and he didn\u2019t stop.

Could you have said it more diplomatically? totally but their entitlement is the real issue.  Woman are at risk for saying NO.\n\nIts true what women say 'We are afraid men will murder us.  Men are afraid of being laughed at'.", "Eh. I wouldn\u2019t say you were an asshole, but you could have just said you weren\u2019t interested and asked him to leave you alone. Giggling at a man who\u2019s flirting with you sends kind of a mixed message, but I laugh when I\u2019m uncomfortable so I get it.", "I think if you say he wasn't rude nor creepy, it was kinda unwarranted, had he been either I would be the first one to say go for it!  but since that was not the case I think  a small YTA.

Unless he\u2019s already in a relationship I don\u2019t see the issue with him hitting on a couple of people at a bar.

Earlier this year I had an older man I was talking to at the bus station forcibly grab me and kiss me on the cheek multiple times. There were multiple times where I decided to take Ubers instead of taking the bus because a man was still creeping around me after I'd given clear indications that I wanted to be left alone. I went to high school within five minutes of the river we were at, and I definitely dealt with a lot of homophobia there, and had queer friends get threatened with physical violence or told to kts. It's definitely an area that makes me nervous.", "A lot of men don't take \"no\" for an answer. I understand why OP went for this instead.", "She didn't want to give her name this way it was clear a male name so a rejection of his advances. \n\nHow exactly makes this op an AH?!!

Me no think good.", "Giggling and saying you're drunk typically isn't a hint that you're uninterested tbh. She never said she dropped any other hints, just that she was thinking of a way to get out.", "If you doubt his feelings were hurt, what's wrong with making a harmless joke that's not designed to hurt feelings? It's a fun way to turn someone down, and it leaves him with a funny story to tell his friends.", "I'm a very socially awkward and anxious person myself, and I thought that if someone were to react this way to me hitting them up, I would just laugh it off and take a hint lol. I really didn't think I did anything wrong until my parents got upset at me about it.", "Yuuuup. I could work up the courage to do this maybe once and if it went even slightly badly it would never happen again lol. Even this story made me wince", "His feelings are not your responsibility, NTA. You did what you felt you needed to do, to be left alone. You're good, don't listen to your family, you did nothing wrong!", "Oh sure, you have to spend your life thinking about some poor dude\u2019s feelings even if you will never new him again.  I am sorry your family is assholes", "Right here in the bar or you wanna go back to your place", "That may be so, but perhaps giving a person a chance first is another tactic a person can try if they're worried about coming off as an asshole - which op is or she wouldn't be posting here. Like I said, I don't think op is an asshole, just offering an alternative.", "So the type of man that won't take no for an answer will be OK with being insulted to his face?", "???", "He didn\u2019t know her sexuality and she said herself he wasn\u2019t being creepy, so he wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. She spent most of the interaction giggling, which doesn\u2019t indicate a lack of interest, and then when he harmlessly asked to be reminded of her name she drops this awful pun & abruptly walks off. It just seems unnecessary.", "It\u2019s so weird they are worried about the feelings of a stranger that has hit on both (two of?) their daughters more than how their daughters felt about it.", "I feel like if he wasn't being harmless by flirting with someone without being creepy about it, then OP is equally being harmless by walking away after making a pun. It's not like she cussed him out or insulted him. She doesn't  have to tell him her sexuality, and making that pun while removing herself from the situation works just as well to let him know she's not interested as outright telling him she isn't, it's just a lot more fun for both parties. I don't see the point in calling it unnecessary as though flirting with someone isn't also unnecessary? They're both just ppl having a harmless, non-confrontational, no stakes interaction with each other. No damage was done to either party, so why is OP the asshole when nothing bad happened?"]}
