Your fears are valid. But as an anonymous third party, I look at it differently and would probably present it differently if you talk to him about it.\n\nA motorcycle (especially a Harley) is a luxury. It is a toy, essentially. You all cannot afford that right now. Even if the payout is more than what he owes (fat chance, unless he put down a huge down payment), that money should be put into savings so you have an emergency fund.\n\nMaybe in a few years things will be different financially and the idea of him owning a bike will be more realistic, but for now I would suggest using the practical argument over the fear. You said in another comment that you have other means of transportation. He may have to just use one of those for a while.", "I\u2019m torn here\u2026 Because on one hand this comes off kinda \u2018nagging wife\u2019.  The tone, as a husband of 20 yrs (who also has a wife who made him get off the bikes) is hard to swallow. But that might just be my baggage. \n\nTHAT SAID:  if you can\u2019t afford diapers, you can\u2019t afford a fucking Harley payment. And if you wanted to ride free of responsibility, you shoulda worn a condom. He\u2019s a husband and dad now, and that comes with an understanding that you don\u2019t get to take risks or spend on yourself first (and yes, a Harley payment when you need diapers is spending on yourself first).  \n\nSo I\u2019m going NTA, but tread lightly on how we get him to hang up the assless chaps, this has huge resentment opportunity if done wrong", "NTA - But you would be if you did not prioritize getting a sizable life insurance policy on your husband. Your fears are completely valid, but you cannot control his behavior. It sounds as though you have voiced your concerns and that they are falling on deaf ears.

It's not wrong to want your husband not to ride again.  But you might as well wish a dog would never bark again.   He is the man he is partly because he rides.  This is one of those 'careful what you wish for' situations.  He'd be extremely stressed out constantly if he thought he could never ride again, or even had to cut down drastically.   Basically, he would cease to be the man you married.  You'd end up married to a stranger.", "NAH. You've gone through a terrible shock and it's completely acceptable to be concerned.\n\nDoes he have another method of transportation? Or is he able to get to work without his own?", "Idk about an asshole but if he wants to keep riding and you give him some sort of ultimatum or start a fight over it then yes you would be.

That before he can ride again or get another bike, he needs to have proper life insurance, some money saved away and that he won't ride in dangerous conditions.\n\nYou have a child together, and this kid doesn't deserve to lose their dad over bad weather conditions or face financial instability because Dad likes his hobby that is more on the dangerous side.\n\nThe accident has made you think about and realise, you're really not prepared financially for a situation where an accident seriously injures or kills him.", "YTA. You're obsessing. Dude's gonna ride bikes. You won't be able to stop it. Figure out your own neurosis about it or you'll continue to be unhappy.", "NTA for wanting him not to ride. But you would be if you tried to force it. Don't voice that opinion to him. You have to come to grips about his desire to ride. Get an insurance policy, one that covers out-of-work personal accidents. You could even have a discussion with him about it and the need for it \"in case there is a next time\". As long as you NEVER say you don't want him to ride but instead are focusing on how he can ride and you both be protected financially, you won't make him defensive.", "We certainly can\u2019t afford it if he can\u2019t work for a period of time. \n\nWhen he got the Harley, he was working a different job and our finances looked a whole lot different. \n\nHe still owes like $13,000 on it I think? Not sure. My dad said insurance will pay what they think it\u2019s worth and it\u2019s a 2013 dyna superglide (I think? Maybe) so I have no clue what all that means.", "We can afford diapers don\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s just without his income that we would run into trouble on that. I don\u2019t work. He is the sole financial provider for our family.\n\nAlso, I wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s like a biker biker if you m ow what I mean. He only got the bike on my birthday back in March, and didn\u2019t have one for a few years before that. He\u2019s never consistently had a bike ya know?", "Absolutely agree with this response. \n\nTake a breath before having a conversation. Your points are 100% reasonable. Your fear is justified.  Buying a Harley right now was not a wise purchase.\n\nHowever, you have to approach him in a way that will achieve your goal of no more bikes for now. Going scorched earth on him will probably not work. \n\nThe good news is the wrist injury will keep him off the bikes for a bit. Hopefully this will be a wake up call for him", "10/10", "NTA for wanting him not to ride.", "I feel you. \n\nHonestly the furthest the conversation went about it was \n\n\u201cThis sucks. I hurt my baby. That bikes my child.\u201d\n\u201cI could give 2 f*cvs about that bike, all I care about is my baby\u201d\n\nAnd that was really it.", "He\u2019s already talking about how he\u2019s gotta do this and that to fix it, and saying how he\u2019s sad he won\u2019t be able to ride for awhile. I know he\u2019s gonna wanna get back on but now I\u2019m terrified. \n\nI mean, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s a biker biker if you know what I mean. I literally got the bike on my birthday back in March. He\u2019s never consistently had a bike so my thing is, why can\u2019t he just not have one ?", "Yes we have other methods of transportation. \n\nI\u2019m unsure how long or if at all that he will be out of work.", "It\u2019s more so just hoping that he can\u2019t get another bike/fix that one because now I\u2019m terrified of him getting back on one. \n\nBut you got a point on it effecting the whole family.", "That means if you owe 13,000 on it and insurance totals it but values it at 10,000, you will still be responsible for paying the 3,000 balance.", "Can you afford him out of work three months?  If you don\u2019t have that saved up, you really cannot afford it.", "> \u201cI could give 2 f\\*cvs about that bike, all I care about is my baby\u201d\n\n  \n\n\nThat's an awful response it that is what you said.\n\n  \n\n\nFirstly it's not \"my\" baby, it's our baby.\n\n  \n\n\nSecondly, your baby is fine, don't make his accident about you and the baby, people can and do get attached to possessions", ">why can\u2019t he just not have one ?\n\nSimply speaking, because he feels naked without it.  You don't have to join an outlaw biker gang to get hooked on riding.  You asking why he can't just give up the bike?  Why can't a bowler give up his bowling ball?  Why can't a golfer give up his clubs?  Why can't a musician give up his guitar?  It's a part of him.  When he's riding, it's literally a part of him.  When he's not riding, he feels like a part of him is missing.  That's why.\n\n(I am a lone biker myself, I understand)", "Point is that this won't address the underlying issue. It will just delay it. At some point if you guys have saved enough money he will just get another bike/fix that one.", "Yep. But I have no clue what insurance will value it at.", "I think there\u2019s some confusion here. The way I read it, the first line is the husband referring to the bike as his baby. The second line is OP referring to her husband as her \u00ab\u00a0baby\u00a0\u00bb.", "By \u201cher baby\u201d she meant her partner, not her infant.", "I\u2019m genuinely confused by this. \n\nHow did I make it about me?", "Except they have a child, wich comes first. They need to save money for unforseen circumstances like losing a job, getting injured/sick and a college fund. \n\nThe priority should be to create stability before doing something he wants to do.", "I mean, with his last bike that he got in 2021 he only had a few months before he up and sold it (I don\u2019t remember why, but nothing was wrong with it) and didn\u2019t get another one until March 2023, that\u2019s what I meant by not a biker biker. And before he got the bike in 2021 I don\u2019t remember him having one before that.", "Well, the chances of dying while bowling are pretty low. Chances of dying while riding a motorcycle are significantly higher. He has a child to think about.  \n\nI did crazy things when I was younger. Once I had kids, I pulled back. I need to be here for my kids. Even if it isn't life threatening, being in the hospital for an extended time will have a huge impact on this family", "The highest Bluebook value for a 2013 Dyna in any trim package is under $10k.  You rarely get much over Bluebook from your insurance.", "You made it about your fears for what \\*might\\* happen\n\n  \n\n\nWhilst he is processing what \\*did\\* happen", "For most hobbies, I would agree with you.  But riding is therapy.   You can have the worst day of your life.   Stress that threatens to give you a heart attack.  As soon as you mount your bike though?  ALL OF IT is gone, almost instantly.   \n\nI know you and I will not agree on this issue.  And the matter is moot, anyway.  He's a rider.  He'll never change.  You could list a thousand reasons why you think he'd be wise to stop riding.\n\nAnd as soon as his bike is fixed, he'll be hitting the  road again.  Might as well ask a kangaroo not to jump.  It's his nature.\n\nIf you don't approve of hubby riding his bike, the time to figure that out is before you get married.   You marry a biker?  Don't be surprised that he's riding.", "I don't know why he sold the bike either, or why he didn't have one before.  I can state, it's a TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE lifestyle.  Especially if you are into Harleys in particular.  Chances are good, his timing of ownership was based largely on fund$$$$$$$   Total speculation...maybe he got a cheap bike as that's all he could afford at the time, but quickly realized he set his sights too low.  I've done that once or twice, way back when, before I came into money.  \n\nThis is a battle you will not win.  He's a biker.  He always will be a biker.  If he doesn't own a bike, he will be sad and constantly planning how to get another bike as soon as possible.", "You seem to think that there is a great chance he will off himself while riding.  He could die in a car accident, also.  Does that mean he shouldn't buy a Camry?  \n\nRiding a motorcycle, for those who love it....it's what helps them keep their sanity.  Having a well-balanced father is good for the child.\n\nKid's going to have fantastic memories of riding with his dad someday.", "I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m struggling to see how it made my fears about what might happen. \n\nHe was voicing his concerns for the bike, and I simply said the bike was the least of my worries and I was more concerned about him and whether or not he was okay.", "Any hobby can be used that way by people.  It\u2019s not unique to biking.", "Sounds about right.\n\nAnd him and my whole family are all about Harleys. My dad has 2, my brother has one, my husband has (had?) one\u2026", "Please look at the statistics of death by motorcycle vs death by car. Doctors call them donor cycles for a reason. If he had been in car, in this situation, there would have been no injury.  \n\nOf course, we can die crossing the street. You can't eliminate all risk. However, a motorcycle is a big risk. While I have never owned a bike, I understand the appeal. I love riding on a motorcycle. A friend just bought a big, gorgeous Harley. I can't wait to go for a ride. But I don't have small kids at home who depend me for the sole source of income. \n\nI agree that parents need their thing to keep their head straight, but perhaps pick something with less chance of death/great bodily injury until the kids are older. \n\nI can tell you are passionate about your bike. This guy might not be at the same level. Sure, he seems to enjoy it, but he might be able to find another passion that is less dangerous", "You are totally right.  So find a hobby you love and throw yourself into it.  OP's hubby found his favorite hobby.  And he's in good company.  A good percentage of people on this planet can totally relate...men and women.  It does seem to be favored by men more though.", "OK, now I'm confused.  Your whole family is all about harleys.  So you know how men are, when it comes to bikes and riding.  But you think your husband can just give it up easily?  Ask your dad to give up his harleys.  His response should be educational, if nothing else.", "All you say is true.  But the older I get, the less I understand avoiding risk to prolong life.  My time on this planet?  I'll take quality over quantity, every day.  If my doctor told me I'd be dead next week unless I immediately give up everything I enjoy doing...\n\nI'd be like, \"Well Doc, it's been a nice enough life, I guess...\"\n\nBut someone riding a motorcycle is not facing that kind of decision.  Sure he's in more danger than if he's driving a car.  But there's absolutely no guarantee he's going to have a serious accident next ride or anytime soon.  And driving the car is work, while riding the motorcycle is fun.  It's not the destination,  it's the journey....", "Which means that if OP\u2019s husband is willing to try investing himself into other hobbies, he can find one that does the same thing for him without the risk of leaving his child fatherless or destroying their finances.", "I agree that the older I get, the more risk I am willing to take. However, this man is the sole provider for a family with a young child. Huge difference.", "Well, there's always mountain climbing.  Or sky diving.  Or naked crocodile wrestling.  The guy should broaden his horizons a bit.   \n\nNOTE:  just joking....\n\n(Had to add that last part as there's always that ONE GUY who will take it literally and flame the f out of you....)", "OK, we are not going to agree on this.   I can tell that already.  But if you are worried about the health of the sole provider, then ...\n\nKeep  in mind that stress is a killer, and riding is a very effective stress reducer.  I think the two balance themselves out, actually.  Increased  risk of injury sure,  but overall health better due to less stress and more exercise."]}
