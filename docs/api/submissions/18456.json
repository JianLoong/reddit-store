She was an addict and she od\u2019d. She left behind 2 kids, Rose (almost 17) and Lilly (7). \n\nMy (23f) husband (26m) is from California and we live on the east cost. My husbands only other family is his mom, who lives in her boyfriends small house. She\u2019s retired and doesn\u2019t make much. This is to say that they don\u2019t have much room and can\u2019t afford 2 kids. The older girl Rose plans on sleeping on their couch till she goes off to college next year. That leaves Lilly. She\u2019s staying with them for right now but MIL really can\u2019t care for her long term due to a multitude of reasons, Mils boyfriend also said he wants her out of his house.\n\nMy husband and his mom want us to take Lilly so that she doesn\u2019t go into foster care. I\u2019m pretty against this for many reasons. \n\nI don\u2019t think my husband is responsible enough to be a parent. He cooks maybe 2-3 times a year, and when he\u2019s not working he usually just wants to play videogames or relax. He\u2019s in the military and he deploys once a year ish for 6+ months. I\u2019m not willing to care for a child that isn\u2019t even related to me alone for that long, I have other responsibilities. When he isn\u2019t deployed he often works 12-16 hour days. He also works the Night Shift and sleeps during the day. And he goes out of town for work often. I know that if we took Lilly in I would be the one making sacrifices to care for her, not my husband. \n\nIf we took her in I know that I would have to be her sole caretaker. I don\u2019t even want kids and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to expect me to basically adopt a 7 year old I\u2019ve never met and am not even related to.

Yes, things happen but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to accept such a change, and you absolutely can and should say no to this if it\u2019s a dealbreaker for you.

He \"forbade\" that.\n\nHe cannot sign you up for a task and responsibility that he is not even willing to take on himself!\n\nNTA\n\nBut your husband is one - it is always easy to volunteer others. You can see true character by whether someone is also willing to do something themselves.\n\nAnd if you don't want to have children, it wouldn't be good for the girl to grow up with you either. She needs someone who wants to take care of her of own free will and who can love her.", "NTA\n\nIt isn't okay for your husband and MIL to assign this responsibility to you.  If your husband wants to raise his niece, get a legal separation or divorce and he can raise her without you.", "NTA, I think you and husband need to be brutally honest. I read your comments. If he doesnt want to parent and you dont want to, but he refuses to take her if you leave then it's clear that this isnt a good decision for anyone. Will that little girl really get what she needs with you guys? Not saying you are bad people, but kids can tell when they arent wanted around. If he takes her, all that's going to happen is it's all going to be pushed on you, until you walk and he will surrender custody at that point (judging by your comments) just let her go to foster care because it will be less upset, could you even take custody across the country or would you be expected to move? or is there paternal family that can take custody?  I really dont think your husband or MIL have really thought this through, it sounds like they heard 'foster care' and freaked out cause shes family and cant possibly go in care. I know there are so many hoops to jump through for custody/to be a foster parent, would you guys even qualify?", "NTA and tbh if anyone should take her it\u2019s MIL, you and husband chose to be child free.

What did he say? Do you think he actually understands how much sacrifice is required to be a decent parent?", "NTA.  To be brutally honest, you and your husband would not make good parents to Lily.  \n\nShe has special needs and she has lost her family. Being treated as an inconvenience and unwelcome is just going to make her worse.\n\nShe would be better off in a foster home with an open adoption, so that she can hear from her birth family occasionally and keep in touch with her sister.

Unless he's willing to make significant changes in his life it's clear the burden of caring for her will fall to you.  He needs to step up and come up with a plan where he contributes to her care.  \n\nIf you did agree to this plan, it wouldn't be good for her as you may feel a lot of resentment that would affect her.\n\nThat said, I am really sad for this little girl as it seems no one really wants to step up and help her through this difficult time in her life and that includes her biological family.", " NTA. It\u2019s an awful situation but considering that you\u2019d be the sole caregiver, if it isn\u2019t something you could handle then it\u2019s better not to.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband needs to get off of his moral high horse.\n\nHe doesn't contribute ANY parenting work, expect you to do ALL of the parenting stuff, and wants all the praise for being the stand-up uncle who to \"raised\" his niece.\n\n\nYou need to set clear boundaries and call out his BS.\n\nHe's asking you to sacrifice your whole life and break you premarital agreement (of child free) so his family could benefit from it.\n\n\nHe's incredibly selfish and you need to reevaluate your relationship if he refuse to respect your perspectives.", "NTA neither of you sound ready for children.  Seems like MIL is guilting your husband.

That child has already been through too much, having a parental figure that resents taking care ofc them and another one who's absent is not the answer", "You need to put him in the drivers seat. Tell him he need to step up. Circumstances such as this could qualify him for non-deployable status. If this is important to him he needs to demonstrate that in the coming months by doing his part and acting like a parent. If he isn\u2019t willing to make that sacrifice, why should you?", "NTA. Forcing you to be a parent when you don't want to won't work out too well.", "NTA.  It sounds like you already chose to live a child-free life.

People who don't want kids should not have kids.  Period.", "NTA  It\u2019s right for you to choose not to take in this responsibility.  If your DH wants to do so, on his time, that\u2019s his right as well.  He needs to change his lifestyle.  He needs to get a civilian job where he is present for this kid.  If you want to stay with him after he does so, great.  If you don\u2019t, that\u2019s cool.  But foisting kids on you and leaving you alone to it is just wrong.  But he is TA for expecting you to undertake this, particularly alone.  You should consider that this situation will be thrown in your face by DH and his mommy for the duration of your marriage.  Do you need that grief for 50 years?", "I feel like if your husband wants to adopt his niece he should be working with his command and planning to leave military service at the end of his service obligation or sooner if his command will support voluntary separation. He should be making a plan to be the primary parent. \n\nIf not, then no, YWNBTA.  You\u2019d need a lot of support and new skills to be the parent this kid will need. It\u2019s not something a person can do reluctantly.", "NTA. YOU would be taking care of these kids, not him. I\u2019m glad you said no.", "NTA\n\nIf he would let you / expect you to do this.... the relationship won't last bc he doesn't value your time or happiness. \n\nSo. Then what? \n\nI would make it clear that if he takes her in, you will be moving out. You don't need to break up in theory it could just be to see if he can handle it and mainly -- so that YOU don't have to.", "NAH\n\nThat\u2019s a really horrible situation all around but you have chosen a childfree life and would end up being her primary caregiver if you took her. Your preferences and reasoning are very valid. \n\nIf your husband wants to change his life around and take her, or provide financial support to his mother to take her, those are different conversations.

I would Never let my grandchildren go into\nFoster care\u2014your MIL will get money from\nThe state for fostering her own grandchildren.  It is about $2500-$3000 a month in CA (I am\na CA CASA).  \n\nBoth those kids probably have huge trauma and are entitled to counseling, health care, etc in CA.  I would be wary of taking them Out of the state.  \n\nAlso, raising a child who has experienced that much trauma is rewarding, but hard.  You aren\u2019t up for it  at 23.

Your husband's niece is not your niece?)\n\nAt any rate, you have very valid concerns, most definitely. But, I know I'd leave my husband if he suggested one of our nieces and nephews go to foster care, rather than our care.\n\nI have broken up with someone who suggested I get rid of my dog, after all. I'm not less devoted to children in our family.\n\nSo, NAH. You aren't wrong. But, this as a personal decision has the potential to change your marriage.", "NAH.\n\nYour husbands family is doing their absolute best to keep their family together. It makes total sense and is not an asshole move to ask you to take in the child. Their family is small. They dont want to lose anymore family. I understand.\n\n\n\nHowever, you not taking in the kid doesnt make you an asshole. Id actually argue that because you know you would be the sole caretaker most of the time, and that you are not prepared nor do you want to take on childcare, you're doing the right thing by saying no. Taking care of a kid is a monumental task and its one you kinda lock in for the next like 11 years. Thats a long term committment. If you say you arent ready and dont want that commitment, thats not an asshole move.\n\n\n\nObviously itd be better to keep the child with her family. But if no one in the family besides you can take her, and you lack the mental willpower and fortutude and dedication to care for her, that leaves nowhere for her but in foster care. Its hard, but sometimes there are no good outcomes in a problem. Either you get stuck with a burden you never wanted for the next decade, or a small family gets even smaller and loses its youngest member. Theres no assholes here.", "NAH this is a shit situation and I feel bad for the kids. You're not an asshole for having concerns about taking in a child, and while your husband is not an asshole for wanting to care for his niece, he would be if he forces it all on you. How many years in does he have? Does voluntary separation and getting a job nearby seem like an option? Because that would be a fair decision. If he wants to adopt his niece, he should step up and be primary parent. \n\nYou're both really young to have this put on you.", "What about the father of the child? Maybe he may want his daughter. OP said the sister was an addict. It doesn't necessarily mean that the father is one.", "NTA - but sheesh, if I was this 7 year old kid, I'd really want and hope for someone in my corner. This is heartbreaking.", "Has this been discussed with the 17 year old sister? I\u2019m very curious because the siblings will be separated.

I hope things work out!", "NTA... But what a horrible situation for an innocent kid. Her mom is deceased (where is her dad?) She probably has huge trauma over her moms death, grandmas boyfriend doesn't like her & wants her out of the house, her uncles wife (yes.. You're her AUNT) doesn't want her and would rather her go to foster care to have God knows what happen to her. Her grandma doesn't love her enough to take care of her. \n\nThis poor girl is either going to end up beaten & abused in the system, selling herself at 13 to survive bc she ran away, or deceased. \n\nI cant imagine having to live with that on my conscience.", "NTA here but not sure if I personally could live with myself knowing I could have helped a kid who just lost their parent have a better life and then chose not to especially family. Kind of a moot point though as I doubt your husband would just let his family be carted off to foster care when he is in the position to do something about it. Would you even want to be with someone who would let that happen?", "NAH \n\n\nThere is not a single way that anyone wins in this situation. The niece deserves someone who wants to love and care for her, and simultaneously deserves not to be separated from her family after losing her mother and put into a system that is corrupted. No one around her can ensure either one. She's the biggest loser here and she's only 7. \n\n\nNo one is obligated to take in a whole child, though, and definitely not if it's gonna stretch them beyond their means, which is what it would do to all the familial adults involved. You shouldn't have to take on 100% of the responsibilities. And the way you talk about her just now is a little on the cold side. You wouldn't be a good fit as a caretaker for her. Your husband is never around, her grandmother has health issues, and a 17 year old shouldn't get forced into being a parent like that. \n\n\nThere is no happy ending here. There is only bitter sweet doing what must be done and someone will be hurt.", "You are NTA. You and the boyfriend are unsympathetic though. She just lost her mom and now grown adults are treating her like this. Again that doesn't make you an AH, it makes you and your husband incompatible. He should file for divorce and raise his niece.

I\u2019m pretty against this for many reasons. \n\nI don\u2019t think my husband is responsible enough to be a parent.
