His end time should be 15 minutes after closing, with the understanding he could leave early with full pay if all cars were out of the lot. He is there to accommodate gym members.", "NTA i used to work a job where occasionally if it was slow i got to leave before closing, and it was awesome, but that is his job, he accepted it, and he is required to work his job until his shift is over.

You left before the posted closing time. It's not as if the attendant had an emergency or something.", "He\u2019s got some big bolos to try to force a customer out early and even coming in.

The gym is ~~at the basement of~~  in a mixed office/retail building with basement parking.  A section of the basement parking is allocated for retail customers including gym-goers (my bad for using the word \"lot\", I meant attended basement parking)\n2. There's a security guard at the entrance/exit of the parking (on the ground floor). I believe that guy stays there all night because there are offices that allow overnight parking. The section for customer parking that includes the gym people (which the attendant is attending to) is just closed off with cones.\n3. I wasn't sorry for my actions either. But I wanted to defuse it a bit because I still need to park there in the future.", "Oh I failed to mention that the parking lot is for the building, and the gym is a tenant there. So guy is employed by building, not the gym. But still he's there to accomodate all the building tenant customers.", "I wouldn't quite say Y T A but it's not cool either. Sounds like OP is really pushing the 11pm close time to the  minute bc they can. The guy probably does have to close up and lock up. He's likely scheduled to the minute and has to watch that he doesn't go into overtime and still get yelled at if he comes in late to adjust for being kept late. Not OP's fault, but still...\n\nAnd I bet the attendant probably thought OP wasn't going to leave at 11pm but would be later. So he's trying to hurry him along so he can get out on time.", "Bad take. The lot closes at 11pm, not 10:45pm. If he doesn't like that he shouldn't be working a job where the lot closes at 11pm. \n\nNTA", "Thanks for sharing this perspective.", "Yeah where I'm from, people are notorious for not actually being on time so I don't blame the guy if he thought I might not actually leave by 11. \n\nGlad to see other people's take on the matter."]}
