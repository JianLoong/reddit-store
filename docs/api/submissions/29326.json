I've met him a few times, and although I don't dislike him, he has a tendency to overdrink. This has led him being kicked out of bars, wetting his pants, falling down, and breaking things in public.\n\nOur wedding will have alcohol. We are having signature drinks and unlimited beer & seltzers. I asked her if it would be possible for him to keep his drinking to a limit, and she said she honestly didn't want to monitor his drinking because her telling him not to drink too much wouldn't work anyway. He's very much a person who does what he wants.\n\nI let her know that this is a wedding, not a night out. He can drink as much as he wants at a club or bar, but he cannot black out at our wedding.  This made her pretty upset and I let her know politely that if after she talks to him, he's still unwilling to change, he will not be permitted as a plus 1 for her.  She told me I could speak with him because he would take me more serious as I am the bride, but I told her again that this makes me uncomfortable because I've only spoken to him a few times. She said that if I'm unwilling to ask, it doesn't mean that much to me.\n\nShe thinks this is unfair because other people are bringing their significant others as +1 and they haven't been together as long she and him have. I told her that this is different because of the context of his behavior. She is still getting a +1, but she says she has no one else to invite.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: There's a comment stating that I'm forcing or pressuring people to drink. Nothing like that is going on.

It pains me too much even now to recite the details. The friend's wife was weeping in humilation, my parents were embarassed, and when he finally sobered up, the family friend was mortified that he had caused such a scene.

It\u2019s your wedding invite anyone you have a personal (and positive) relationship with, even if it is only through their partner.    \n\nA good party - including a wedding- has to be planned to have a good mix of people. That way someone without a plus one doesn\u2019t sit alone at your wedding.

It happens.  I get you not wanting to have that at your wedding.  At the same time, chances are, there will be another sloppy drunk there if you have an open bar.  So you trying to put some kind of soft limit on him that you aren't putting on others, just won't go over well.  \n\nNow, truth is, if I was the boyfriend, I'd be happy to not attend this wedding, since you clearly don't want him there.

My friend had a partner very similar to this, we decided to let him come to our wedding to keep the peace. We had beer and wine only- this guest was a large part of this choice. He snuck in a flask anyways and barfed TWICE at my wedding.", "NTA.  I dated someonenlike this.  No matter what you said he would deny it and say he could control it.  He would then proceed  to get so drunk that  he would still think he was fine till he had an accident, the change your clothes kind and it was everyone else's fault, because people didn't  stop him from drinking too much.\n\nHe won't change. Your friend isn't  being a good friend by trying to get you to tell him.  He will make a mess and she knows it.\n\nShe says she won't  have anyone to go with if he doesn't go, so you need to tell her that as much as you  would love to have her there you understand if she doesn't  attend because he is not invited to your wedding.  She can choose to come to your wedding solo, with a friend or not at all.  \nDon't give in because if you do you will spend the entire time worrying about how he will behave, etc. and you deserve to have your special moment without the drama.  You may also want to make sure you have people there that will keep him out if she decides to bring him anyway.", "NTA Though I would advise you follow her suggestion of being the one to speak to him. You claim this is not 'socially acceptable' because you've only met him a few times, and if this were just a generic gathering, weekend BBQ kinda thing, you'd be right. But it's not, it's a one-off special event: your wedding. \n\nYou are well within you rights to send him a message, or call him and say something like \"hey, I know you're expecting to attend our wedding as Friend's plus one, and we would love to have you there, however, I feel like I need to bring up something that's causing us some concern. We know you like to drink, and we're not judging you on that, but given this is our wedding, Groom and I would really appreciate it if you could practice moderation. We really don't want to be dealing with people who are black-out drunk at a night that is supposed to be a joyful event, and we will be stressed enough dealing with the day as it is. We're asking anyone who thinks they won't be able to control themselves and keep their drinking to a moderate level to really consider whether they might be better to attend the ceremony but not the reception, to think it over and let us know. We hope you'll be willing to make this concession and join us on this special day.\"\n\nMake sure you use 'we' and 'use' and not 'I' or 'me', so it doesn't make him think that he can get around you and \"well, you're just a prude and your fiance would agree with me!\" Also, make it sounds like you're not singling him out alone, make it seem like you're making this request of everyone. \n\nIf he then blows up, I suggest giving him a day, because let's be honest here, no matter how you phrase it, no one likes being told bad things about themselves, and our initial, natural reaction is usually defensive anger. But if, after a day or two, he's texting/calling you non-stop horrible abusive/insulting language, then you rescind his invitation altogether. \n\nOr if you really don't want to take the chance at all, maybe try and find a way to phrase it that is kind of passive-aggressive. Enough to piss him off, but not enough to make your friend angry on his behalf. \n\nGood luck. NTA.", "NTA.  If you decide to let him come, make it VERY clear that the moment he's seen exceeding two drinks, or shows any signs at all of drunkenness, he will be expected to leave peacefully before he has to be removed forcibly.\n\nAlcoholism isn't just drinking all the time; if you can abstain for weeks but are unable to control your intake once you start, that is a problem, too.  I hope she will take this as a sign to support him to find help.", "I mean she is right saying it might actually mean something coming from you instead of her. He\u2019d probably just brush her off and do t anyway. He might even embarrassed you\u2019re aware of him constantly pissing himself so much you had to have a conversation with him. I get it\u2019s her SO and she should do it, but maybe meet her halfway or just not invite him at all because I definitely see her way of thinking. And if she does talk to him he\u2019ll probably not care or actually listen and still get blacked out.", "NTA \n\nBut why don\u2019t you just alert the bar tenders and servers to limit alcohol consumption for all guests to keep people from getting too drunk? \n\nI mean, nobody should be getting blackout fall down drunk at your wedding. Not just this person. The bar tenders should have plenty of experience with this kind of thing, and they should know that in a LOT of places if they overserve someone and that person causes an injury (knock on wood that doesn\u2019t happen) then the bartender can sometimes be held liable. So a good bar tender will cut someone off without you even needing to ask them to.", "NTA no one wants a drunkard acting a fool, throwing up, or passing out at their wedding.", "YWNBTA at all. And I'm sorry, her excuse is just that, an excuse. Although I would be slightly worried why she is afraid to talk to her bf, it's still not your responsibility. This is something she is going to have to figure out or deal with. This isn't a hs party. People generally don't want or like to be around those who can not control themselves when they drink. He is an adult, and he needs to be responsible for his behavior. If he knows he gets out of control when he drinks, he either needs to monitor how, what, and how much he drinks or he needs to stay sober. This will not be the first, nor the last time, that her bf (and her by association) doesn't get an invite to events. It is also not your problem or responsibility if she doesn't have anyone else she can bring and doesn't want to go by herself. \n\nThis is what her future is going to look like if she stays with him. No one else is going to talk to him about it. That's not their job. Again, it's hers. \n\nYour choices are to tell her he can come but he is her responsibility, she needs to either monitor and control his drinking (which hardly ever works) or she needs to tell him to be an adult and behave properly at someone else's wedding. Or she can come alone or not come. The only other thing you could do would allow him to come, but have plans in place to kick him out the absolute instant he goes too far. It really comes down to how important it is to you that she be there. However, a wake-up call to her may not be a bad thing. Again though, her being afraid to talk to him (because that's what is sounds like) would worry me that he could potentially be abusive towards her and she doesn't know what to do or how to get out. That may not be the case at all. But it does concern me when a friend refuses to talk to their someone (SO, friend, family member whatever) about a known behavioral issue. She wants you to be the bad guy completely. She doesn't want to give him the chance to shoot the messenger. \n\nThe bottom line is if you don't want him there, he's not invited. If she doesn't want to come without him, you're sad she won't be there, but you understand. If she says he will behave, and you say ok, make it clear to her that he is her responsibility. That you will not hesitate to kick him out or call the cops if it comes to that. And you will not be responsible to any degree for any outcome of his presence", "NTA.\nThere\u2019s no requirement that she bring a +1 if that\u2019s the case. Does she know other\u2019s who will be attending? She can tag along with some friends. I have a suspicion that she\u2019ll also have a hard time telling her boyfriend he\u2019s uninvited because I\u2019m sure he will insist his drinking is not that bad\u2026if he goes at all, then she should be uninvited too. It\u2019s a hard thing to do, but the thing about weddings is\u2026it\u2019s not about the guests. It\u2019s about you and your partner. \n\nShe\u2019s still responsible when things get out of hand with him. I know it\u2019s not fun for her, but it\u2019s not fun for anyone. If she wants a night off from babysitting, she needs to leave baby at home. There\u2019s no amount of \u201ctelling you to tell him\u201d that will make you responsible for him instead of her, nor make him change if he doesn\u2019t want to change", "NTA  \nHow are you possibly pressuring people to drink?  \nAnyway, I'm sorry your friend is unhappy but there is no way in hell I would invite a person who has a history as a sloppy drunk to my wedding. There is no chance that he will suddenly be able to control his drinking. Your every day, good time drinker does not get kicked out of bars, wet his pants, fall down and break things in public.", "I sure wish **I** would get invited to weddings.\n\nI don't drink. :-D\n\nNTA.\n\nThis is \\*her\\* albatross to wear, if she's dating someone like that, not yours.", "YWNBTAH. \n\nMy youngest sister just got married last month and she\u2019s 27, her husband is 30.\n\nThey had an amazing wedding and spared no expense- open bar from start to finish. Busses to and from the venue from multiple hotels as well as tons of food and water being made available at all times. \n\nWe knew there would be people who really loved the open bar, and assumed that they would have a few people who would **really** take advantage of the free booze. \n\nWe had NO IDEA how much some people would actually drink, and there were truly at least 10 people who seriously embarrassed themselves that night. \n\nThe photographer and I walked in on a couple having sex, one of them fully naked, on my sister\u2019s bathrobe (the bride) on the chaise lounge in the bridal suite. \n\nThen we found someone SHITTING outside in the garden.
