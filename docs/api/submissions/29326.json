I've met him a few times, and although I don't dislike him, he has a tendency to overdrink. This has led him being kicked out of bars, wetting his pants, falling down, and breaking things in public.\n\nOur wedding will have alcohol. We are having signature drinks and unlimited beer & seltzers. I asked her if it would be possible for him to keep his drinking to a limit, and she said she honestly didn't want to monitor his drinking because her telling him not to drink too much wouldn't work anyway. He's very much a person who does what he wants.\n\nI let her know that this is a wedding, not a night out. He can drink as much as he wants at a club or bar, but he cannot black out at our wedding.  This made her pretty upset and I let her know politely that if after she talks to him, he's still unwilling to change, he will not be permitted as a plus 1 for her.  She told me I could speak with him because he would take me more serious as I am the bride, but I told her again that this makes me uncomfortable because I've only spoken to him a few times. She said that if I'm unwilling to ask, it doesn't mean that much to me.\n\nShe thinks this is unfair because other people are bringing their significant others as +1 and they haven't been together as long she and him have. I told her that this is different because of the context of his behavior. She is still getting a +1, but she says she has no one else to invite.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: There's a comment stating that I'm forcing or pressuring people to drink. Nothing like that is going on.

He is your friend's problem and she's apparently afraid to address his drinking problem with him, which is very telling. She is offended because she's in denial.

If her partner wants to continue to go on acting like an AH, maybe this will help her to wise up sooner rather than later.\n\nMany years ago at my brother's wedding, a family friend became exceedingly drunk and behaved inappropriately. It pains me too much even now to recite the details. The friend's wife was weeping in humilation, my parents were embarassed, and when he finally sobered up, the family friend was mortified that he had caused such a scene.

It\u2019s your wedding invite anyone you have a personal (and positive) relationship with, even if it is only through their partner.    \n\nA good party - including a wedding- has to be planned to have a good mix of people. That way someone without a plus one doesn\u2019t sit alone at your wedding.

It happens.  I get you not wanting to have that at your wedding.  At the same time, chances are, there will be another sloppy drunk there if you have an open bar.  So you trying to put some kind of soft limit on him that you aren't putting on others, just won't go over well.  \n\nNow, truth is, if I was the boyfriend, I'd be happy to not attend this wedding, since you clearly don't want him there.
