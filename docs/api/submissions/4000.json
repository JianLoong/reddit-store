I'm not sure entirely why. She loves the men in our family and can obviously work with men casually and professionally, but when it comes to personal relationships, absolutely not. Her male friends never lasted very long. \n\nThe only personal relationship I've ever seen her have with a man that wasn't part of our family was with her late husband. They married right out of college and were married until he passed almost three years ago. She's never expressed interest in dating men since.  \n\nMy husband's brother, Rick, has always struggled with dating. He always liked Bea and didn't hide it. About a year after Bea's husband passed, he begged me and my husband for approval to try to go out with her. I didn't want him to because she's never expressed interest in dating anyone since and it would make things awkward either way, but my husband convinced me to give it a try because \"they were both lonely\" and it's \"just a question\", so I did. I did tell Bea, who obviously wasn't interested but said she would be fine turning him down gently if she didn't have to be alone for it. \n\nSo we planned to have a dinner just the four of us at a local chinese buffet. As we thought, Rick spent all night trying to flirt with Bea. I'm not sure if it was the food or what, but she was starting to feel not right, but it seemed like it would be okay with some time and air. We finished dinner and walked over to a park. When he finally asked her out, she opened her mouth to respond and vomited. Not a little bit either. Like full stomach clearing out vomit. He tried to laugh it off, but she just said \"i'd...rather not\" before apologizing to us all profusely and leaving as quickly as possible. The night ended there.\n\nRick is now mad at us for letting him be \"humiliated like that\" and thinks that my sister should give him a chance at least. My husband is mad at me for not convincing my sister to do one date, and his mother thinks I specifically set up Rick to humiliate him and \"destroy the confidence he'd struggled so long to build up\". My sister says she didn't puke on purpose, but isn't willing to go out with him because she doesn't want to do a pity date. I don't think I did anything wrong. I told him it wouldn't work. I got my sister to come out and try and it all went wrong. Obviously I didn't know that it would be like that, but things happen.", "created_utc": 1670235178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd31mr/aita_for_letting_my_sister_puke_on_my_brother_in/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
