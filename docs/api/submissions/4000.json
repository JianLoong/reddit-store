I'm not sure entirely why. She loves the men in our family and can obviously work with men casually and professionally, but when it comes to personal relationships, absolutely not. Her male friends never lasted very long. \n\nThe only personal relationship I've ever seen her have with a man that wasn't part of our family was with her late husband. They married right out of college and were married until he passed almost three years ago. She's never expressed interest in dating men since.  \n\nMy husband's brother, Rick, has always struggled with dating. He always liked Bea and didn't hide it. About a year after Bea's husband passed, he begged me and my husband for approval to try to go out with her. I didn't want him to because she's never expressed interest in dating anyone since and it would make things awkward either way, but my husband convinced me to give it a try because \"they were both lonely\" and it's \"just a question\", so I did. I did tell Bea, who obviously wasn't interested but said she would be fine turning him down gently if she didn't have to be alone for it. \n\nSo we planned to have a dinner just the four of us at a local chinese buffet. As we thought, Rick spent all night trying to flirt with Bea. I'm not sure if it was the food or what, but she was starting to feel not right, but it seemed like it would be okay with some time and air. We finished dinner and walked over to a park. When he finally asked her out, she opened her mouth to respond and vomited. Not a little bit either. Like full stomach clearing out vomit. He tried to laugh it off, but she just said \"i'd...rather not\" before apologizing to us all profusely and leaving as quickly as possible. The night ended there.\n\nRick is now mad at us for letting him be \"humiliated like that\" and thinks that my sister should give him a chance at least. My husband is mad at me for not convincing my sister to do one date, and his mother thinks I specifically set up Rick to humiliate him and \"destroy the confidence he'd struggled so long to build up\". My sister says she didn't puke on purpose, but isn't willing to go out with him because she doesn't want to do a pity date. I don't think I did anything wrong. I told him it wouldn't work. I got my sister to come out and try and it all went wrong.

Shaddup' already! \ud83e\udd23", ">If she's come across other Ricks in her life, no wonder she's not all that interested in spending time with men\n\nYeah, I'm wondering how attractive and disillusioned she is, the whole\n\n>Her male friends never lasted very long.\n\nMakes me think that any guy she lets in at all eventually tries to get in her pants. OP's husband is disgusting.", "He isn\u2019t doing him any favors. His brother isn\u2019t entitled to any date. With anyone.", "It doesn\u2019t justify the behavior. Bea isn\u2019t some play thing for BIL because the husband cares so much about his brother at the expense of your sister. That is what is going on - your husband thinks it\u2019s fine for your sister to sacrifice her needs because his brother is more important.", "Aye I was quite confused when OP said they needed a meeting to 'let him down'. Like surely it's far more awkward to have a dinner and let him down in front of his brother and SIL than to just pass on the \"by the gods please piss off\" message to him.", "I ran into a couple people who wouldn't take no for an answer when I was younger, and it scared me a little and also really pissed me off. Like dude, I told you that you are not buying me a drink. Don't look at the bartender and try to order one for me anyway.\n\nThat family is nuts.", "I\u2019m extremely worried about how abusive and dysfunctional these family dynamics are, and that the OP doesn\u2019t recognize it. \n\nSo, the compassion goes towards the BIL and his fragile ego, not the woman with a gastrointestinal illness? Who lost her beloved husband and has expressed zero interest in a new relationship? \n\nI mean, how can the OP and her sister resist such a respectful fulfilling offer from BIL? So lucky they can fulfill this man\u2019s need for an easily available victim, ahem, future wife!", "Sometimes you just gotta' tell people to their faces: This is why nobody likes you. You're thirsty as hell. And that's annoying. So I'll help you out, my sister does not like you like that. And obviously most of the women you heckle about your loneliness aren't into you either. Any more questions? I'm here to help?", ">OP is AH for even agreeing to chaperone this \"date.\"\n\nIt wasn't actually a date. The plan was for Bea to turn him down, and she wanted OP there as support. It sounds like Bea gave her consent for this outing to happen for the express purpose of letting Rick know how she felt-maybe she underestimated how she'd feel about the whole thing, but presumably she's a grown woman (no ages are mentioned so I can't be sure) who can make her own choices. It's not like OP coerced her into this. OP just let her know how Rick felt, and Bea made the decision to turn him down.", "Like I said, the guy in this situation is being ridiculous. I'm just mentioning that, in the abstract, I don't think it's really \"desperate\" to still be interested in someone after that. It happens to the best of us.", "OP was trying to please everyone. I think she told the men Bea was willing to meet, and then told Bea it was a chance to let Rick down.\n\nThis is why Rick's mom is mad with OP and accusing her of setting Rick up, IMO.", "If only she'd give him a chance? It would take him off their hands?\n\nThat's what they really care about. Not having to listen to him whine that no woman wants him.", "Some stranger tried to ask me out on the street once. When I ignored him, he grabbed my wrist and said I was ignoring him when he was being nice. Just scary as all eff.", "I've had it happen with a couple women.  Like no, not interested, and that doesn't mean try to sit on my lap.", ">So, the compassion goes towards the BIL and his fragile ego, not the woman with a gastrointestinal illness?\n\nAlso, like, read the room? The way the post is written, it sounds like Bea expressed that she wasn't feeling well and needed some time and air to feel better and this dude thought \\*that\\* was the time to shoot his shot? \n\nIf you don't want to get vomited on, don't push a grieving widow to date you when she's already expressed reluctance and is already nauseous", "I'm snickering at \"this is why nobody likes you.\" Brilliant.", "Bea is a widow, so she must be a grown woman. If she's in the US she had to be at least... Oh. Well, I hope OP would've mentioned it if she had to get parents to sign off on her first (maybe only) marriage.", "The fellow in question clearly interpreted as a date. \n\nAnd there was enough pressure from the husband and MIL (and continues to be a lot of pressure) that Bea needs and deserves someone who will stand up and say \"she said \"no\" and he doesn't get anything except a \"no\" conveyed by the person he actually asked about this.\"\n\nThis guy didn't ask Bea out directly, and it was on whomever he spoke to in order to convey the message to pass on the \"no.\" \n\nAs it was, he got a meal with Bea, which he had no right to, because she was feeling pressure that she owed him to \"let him down gently\" rather than just convey a \"no\" through the go-between, and she's still getting pressure to date him.\n\nOP needs to be a strong ally to Bea in the face of this pressure.", "Aye that seems likely, so she's actually The Uber Mega TA", "I believe it. Sorry that happened, it's really uncomfortable when it does.", "If you believe in spirits, the spirit of the deceased husband was there for her one more time.\n\n\"You'll find love again, sweetheart, but this isn't the one.\"\n\n*pukes*", "Haha! Yeah, I forgot about Bea being married once while I was making that comment and only remembered by the time I already posted it and figured it wasn't worth it to make an edit for it. Thanks for the laugh!", ">Bea needs and deserves someone who will stand up and say \"she said \"no\" and he doesn't get anything except a \"no\" conveyed by the person he actually asked about this.\"\n\nShe also needs someone who respects her decisions. Of course, this is all down to who's idea the dinner was where Bea would turn Rick down. If it was OP's idea, then yes, she needs to also learn not to push her sister and stand up for her when she needs it. But if it was Bea's idea, then it would be patronizing for OP to take that decision away from her. \n\nTo me, it comes down to the ages of those involved as well. If Bea is still young, I can see where she'd be more influneced by her sister and agree to it if this was OP's suggestion. Whoever the older and younger sister is might play a part in this too. \n\nUnfortunately, we don't know the details of how they decided to have dinner with Rick: who's suggestion it was, was there any guilting involved in making a decision, etc. \n\n>As it was, he got a meal with Bea, which he had no right to, because she was feeling pressure that she owed him to \"let him down gently\" rather than just convey a \"no\" through the go-between,\n\nWe don't actually know if Bea was pressured to do so from OP bc OP didn't mention the hows or whys of planning the dinner."]}
