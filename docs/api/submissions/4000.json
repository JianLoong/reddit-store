I'm not sure entirely why. She loves the men in our family and can obviously work with men casually and professionally, but when it comes to personal relationships, absolutely not. Her male friends never lasted very long. \n\nThe only personal relationship I've ever seen her have with a man that wasn't part of our family was with her late husband. They married right out of college and were married until he passed almost three years ago. She's never expressed interest in dating men since.  \n\nMy husband's brother, Rick, has always struggled with dating. He always liked Bea and didn't hide it. About a year after Bea's husband passed, he begged me and my husband for approval to try to go out with her. I didn't want him to because she's never expressed interest in dating anyone since and it would make things awkward either way, but my husband convinced me to give it a try because \"they were both lonely\" and it's \"just a question\", so I did. I did tell Bea, who obviously wasn't interested but said she would be fine turning him down gently if she didn't have to be alone for it. \n\nSo we planned to have a dinner just the four of us at a local chinese buffet. As we thought, Rick spent all night trying to flirt with Bea. I'm not sure if it was the food or what, but she was starting to feel not right, but it seemed like it would be okay with some time and air. We finished dinner and walked over to a park. When he finally asked her out, she opened her mouth to respond and vomited. Not a little bit either. Like full stomach clearing out vomit. He tried to laugh it off, but she just said \"i'd...rather not\" before apologizing to us all profusely and leaving as quickly as possible. The night ended there.\n\nRick is now mad at us for letting him be \"humiliated like that\" and thinks that my sister should give him a chance at least. My husband is mad at me for not convincing my sister to do one date, and his mother thinks I specifically set up Rick to humiliate him and \"destroy the confidence he'd struggled so long to build up\". My sister says she didn't puke on purpose, but isn't willing to go out with him because she doesn't want to do a pity date. I don't think I did anything wrong. I told him it wouldn't work. I got my sister to come out and try and it all went wrong.

Someone needs to start keeping Rick away from her or you can best believe she\u2019s going to do it herself and stop coming around.\n\nI think the only real mistake you made here was that you let your husband try to push everyones boundaries here by trying to give Rick a chance like he deserved and that no one has called Rick out publicly for what he\u2019s doing.", "NTA\n\nBut you need to stand up to your husband and his family and not let them bully you and your sister like this. Put an end to this discussion quickly.", "INFO:\n\nWhy did you plan a double date when Bea wasn't interested and Rick had no chance anyway? What was the point? Not sure what your thought process was here, but it reads like the dinner was planned with the intention of rejecting Rick. Why not just skip the entire thing?", "NTA. What were you supposed to do?", "She doesn\u2019t have to give him shit. She said no and that\u2019s final. NTA", "NTA. Nothing good can come from catering to an incel.", "NTA. Here\u2019s the deal- I don\u2019t know exactly how other people operate, but I have to like someone on some level to want to go out with them. And, much like the forced family harmony thing we always see blowing up on AITA, it turns out that you cannot make someone feel any type of way about someone else.  \nIf I\u2019m not feeling it, nothing will make that change. Why would anyone want to date someone who wasn\u2019t just neutral about them at first, but was actively telling them \u201cno, I don\u2019t feel that way about you, I\u2019m not interested\u201d? It\u2019s weird and pathetic behavior to keep begging for a crumb of their time when they\u2019ve made it clear they don\u2019t feel any positive way about you, and getting puked on should be a pretty obvious sign that this is a non-starter. Your BIL doesn\u2019t live in some weird-ass hallmark movie where he eventually, through dickish persistence, wins the love of the prickly widow. She doesn\u2019t like him and he needs to leave her alone.", "NTA. And people wonder why Bea doesn't like men or want to date. Hmmmm", "You didn't want to ask, but your husband convinced you to ask.  \nShe did want the date, agreed to dinner.  \nHe spend all dinner flirting even though she clearly wasn't responding.  \nShe said no and your husband is trying to pressure you into pressuring her into going on the date.  \nHis parents are also putting pressure on you.  \n\nDid you marry into an entire family of date rapists? And why are you helping them?\n\nIf she owes him a date because he wants it and \"he'd struggled so long to build up\" his confidence, what will he think she owes him to make up for the puke?\n\nESH except your sister - stop being his family's weapon against your sister.", "I think you should ask why your husband and his brother have such a hard time understanding the word no. Particularly from a woman. It\u2019s not a good look.", "NTA. Tell BIL all of them that you  can't make Bea like him or want to date him. They all need to get over it and he needs to look outside the family pool for a relationship.  They act like you have a button you can push to get her BIL a date.", "NTA\n\n\"that my sister should give him a chance at least. My husband is mad at me for not convincing my sister to do one date\"\n\nShe already said she is not interested, she doesn't owe him shit.", "NTA\nThat is hilarious", "NTA. Your title makes it seem like you and your sister planned it. T A for click bait shit.", "NTA. Your title is misleading - from the story, you didn\u2019t \u201clet\u201d her puke on him, it just accidentally happened. \u201cLetting\u201d her would mean you knew it was coming and stepped out of the way so it hit him instead of you or something. \n\nHe tried to flirt with her, she wasn\u2019t interested, she said no. She doesn\u2019t owe him anything. Neither do you. He needs to get over this and move on.", "NTA - wasn\u2019t the double date with your husband the \u201cdate\u201d? Why would he get a redo? That\u2019s ridiculous", "INFO:  does everyone think that she vomited because he asked?  it sounds like she developed food poisoning.", "NTA\n\nYour husband and his whole posse of family cannot accept a \"No, not interested\" from a woman. Your sister met with Rick, and wasn't interested. But somehow she should go on a date with him. And when she again says not interested, what then? This is really worrying attitude and entitlement your husband, his mother and brother show here.", "NTA and even if she adored men your BIL isn't a prize among them. If you can't read the room enough to not ask a woman trying not to barf her guts out to go on a date then you have issues.", "NTA. Rick needs to learn that rejection is part of dating and \u201cno\u201d really does in fact mean \u201cno.\u201d It does not mean \u201cmaybe\u201d or \u201ctry harder.\u201d Honestly, it\u2019s demeaning and disrespectful when anyone, man or woman, won\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d for an answer. \n\nRemind him and your MIL that he\u2019s an adult and needs to learn how to handle himself as an adult with grace and integrity; not like a toddler throwing a tantrum when he doesn\u2019t get what he wants. If his ego and confidence are so fragile then he shouldn\u2019t be dating yet. He needs to work on himself.", "Ummmm I think your sisters actions speak for themselves. That was a HELL NO to a date. \ud83d\ude02\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nNo is a complete sentence. None of your husband\u2019s family seems to understand that.", "NTA. Their insistence is out of line.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for sharing this story, it made me laugh, not just because it's funny, but also for personal reasons.", "NTA. But careful, your Husband and BIL both give off huge 'manosphere' and incel vibes. Your sister doesn't owe anyone a date or even the time of her day. Neither is she a thing to be won or taken, she is an adult human being and seems more than capable of living her own life. Lastly being 'nice' or a 'nice guy' doesn't entitle you to a date with someone.", "NTA\n\nNo one is entitled to a date with anyone, no is entitled to just \"give it a try\". No is No.\n\nMaybe tell Rick that if he wants a chance to go out with someone, showing some basic respect for people would be a good start.\n\nRick and your HB are TA for pushing, for ignoring the NO and trying to demand other people give up their time for them just because they want to.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't throw up on purpose, first of all. Second of all, you warned him and he pushed anyway. You even told your husband it wasn't a good idea.\n\nNo one owes someone they're not interested in a pity date. No is a complete sentence.\n\nHope your sister feels better soon.", "ESH Your sister is an AH for not paying for the dry cleaning. Everyone else is an AH for not respecting her boundaries.", "BUT HE'S JUST A NICE GUY/s", "I think OP should look out for other signs of incel behavior/ misogyny from her husband. No male friend of mine would EVER demand someone go on a date they didn't want to, or try and get a friend to \"convince\" the non-consenting party to agree to a date (ie: wear them down), and certainly wouldn't act this entitled to someone's time and affection. \n\nIt's just gross all around.", "I personally can't get over the fact that OP's sister literally VOMITED on the dude while turning him down and he STILL wants to go out with her? To the point of being upset with OP for not forcing her to go on a pity date? \n\nHow desperate is this guy?", "NTA your husband and BIL are humongous ones though\u2026 the entitlement that she should have given him a chance", "OP now has the perfect excuse to stop this dead going forward: sorry BIL, you make her sick.", "[removed]", "NTA you already did more than you needed to do and more than you were comfortable doing. Stand your ground and tell them your sister has said she\u2019s not interested and they need to respect that. No means no.", "The OP is the AH for being part of setting up this weird \"let him down gently\" double non-date. I'm completely baffled as to why he had to be told no in person by the OP's sister, and why the decision was made to do it in a romantic pseudo-date setting of a meal followed by a walk in the park.", "This. Everyone agreee very amicably to the double date and it didn't work out. OP even warned both the BIL and her sister. It should end there. The brothers humiliation is his own problem.", "She did though. OP said that after declining she apologized profusely to everyone and left.", "Yes! The puking was an accident! It seems like she got sick from dinner, and everyone knew it, and she had to go outside to calm her stomach but was still a little green around the gills. And *this * is what BIL thought was the perfect time for romance?\n\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on \u201cmake her go on one date just to see.\u201d YUCK", "NTA\n\nAgreed that you're too harsh on her though. Even saying she's never shown any interest in men, when she's even been married to one. Since she has seemingly no trouble being around men professionally, what's the problem? Let her never date another person if that's what she chooses. Because all this should be her choice, and hers only.", "I guess if a guy is harassing your sibling and she progresses to ranged attacks, OP is supposed to dive in the way to shield the guy from the consequences of his own actions. Lol", "Kind of? Sounds like classic incel behaviour to me.", "She don\u2019t hate men, just doesn\u2019t feel comfortable around them but she keep it civil. So I see no issues, if a men has never liked a woman, if he doesn\u2019t insult or assault or if he isn\u2019t rude, then it\u2019s ok!\nPlus the physical reaction that she had around the BIL (a man) makes me think she may have some kind of trauma involving men. \nMisandrist is hating all men, but she doesn\u2019t hate men , just dislike them ( or more doesn\u2019t feel comfortable around them) so no she isn\u2019t.", "NTA\n\nTell your BIL and family to stop sexually harassing your sister.  They are getting close to criminal activity.", "I mean, do you really *know* you wouldn't wanna marry someone if you don't give it a try? /s", "Just organize the marriage and get over the issue already!", "I would say OP is potentially TA based on her putting her poor sister through this crap.", ">**misandrist**\n\n>/m\u026a\u02c8sandr\u026ast/\n\n>*noun*\n\n\n\n>a person who **dislikes**, despises, or is strongly prejudiced against men.\n\n\nIf I disliked and \"didn't feel comfortable\" around black people and therefore avoided them, would that not make me racist? The only difference here is the group being discriminated against. Do all the mental gymnastics you want, the only reason this is flying is because this sub leans SJW and believes in all that power imbalance bullshit. It's specifically ok because men are the group being attacked.\n\nEdit: For the replier. \"My sister Bea **doesn't like men** and never has\" Yes OP's sister. It's not up for discussion or argument, she's a misandrist. No personal trauma excuses it, because it wouldn't excuse a man either. Maybe stop with the double standards before you demand equality.", "Clearly the right thing to do here is for OP to take her husband and MIL\u2019s feedback as honest and completely unbiased, reflect on and disapprove of her sister\u2019s life choices, ignore everything her sister has said to date, and guilt the woman into a date with her husband\u2019s brother. Then and only then would she have done right \ud83d\ude44", "Hubbys mom not OPs mom", "Are you trying to respond to op?\n\nEdit: This comment was stolen from /u/MuddlerMeddler", "So not op's sister"]}
