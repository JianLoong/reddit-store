If she wants to make things about her you can't stop her. What you *can* do is make sure you are available to your aunt. Make her your priority. Ignore any drama your mum is causing and do what you think your aunt needs. Unfortunately since you have the memory of the death of your dad, you know what that might be. Do that.", "NAH - Everyone grieves differently, and your advice, while being a great one, may not be helping her through that grief.\n\nHer reaction is wrong but I'll refrain calling people asshole over how they handle losing someone as long as it isn't over the top.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFollow your advice yourself though, and be there for your aunt :)", "NTA As someone who has been where you are( dealing with someone who makes EVERYTHING about them), you are right. Your mother isn\u2019t going to change though. You do realize that? She sounds selfish, at the very least.", "I think you\u2019ve got the right spirit in wanting to help your aunt, but sometimes people are just the kind to fall apart when grief happens. You really can\u2019t tell people how to grieve. Your mom lost a nephew, too, so she is feeling her own sense of loss as well. It is awesome that your aunt is handling it so well, but maybe instead of telling your mom what to do, you could try being the person that your aunt can lean on and cry with if she needs to. NAH here", "NAH.\n\nYour dad\u2019s passing is still so recent. I imagine you all are still processing that, and that\u2019s likely affecting how you and your mother are handling this new loss. Were your mom and dad together when he died?", "NTA. You're absolutely right. Your aunt definitely doesn't need the stress of dealing with other people's grief right now.", "NAH\n\n\nI know you have your aunt's feelings at heart, and you're only trying to help.\n\n\nIt's not just a parent that grieves. Your mom is grieving, legitimately. It's not just about your cousin either, shes grieving for who your aunt used to be, because that person is gone now too. Trying to police grief is not OK. \n\n\nAlso, telling someone to calm down has a 100% failure rate, so only say it if you're trying to escalate the situation and make people feel less calm, because that's all it actually achieves. \n\n\nIf you feel in a position to help your aunt more, that's great, you absolutely should. Like you say, she undoubtedly needs it, i cant imagine the pain shes going through, and wouldnt want to. But you can't make you mom do it.", "NTA - You are correct in telling your Mom that this is about your Aunt & not her. That you need to be caring for said Aunt & not bringing more drama to the situation. I'm sorry you lost a cousin, even one you weren't necessarily super close to.\n\nI'm sorry for the loss of your father; I'm about 18 months into the loss of my own & did the same as you comforting everyone else & rarely allowing myself any time to grieve. Please once you are out of the current situation, make time for yourself to grieve.", "NTA.", "NTA. I would tell her you feel the way you do because of what happened with your father\u2019s death. Also, be there for your aunt because your mother will not.", "YTA, your mother has a right to grieve over the loss of a nephew. During the period immediately after a loss, people are going to react differently. Some will be stoic, others will be emotive, its not selfish to grieve with family.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like you're trying to bring some empathy into the room. Good on you. Grief is rough on everyone, and no one is showing up as their best selves because they're a wreck. Even your mom.

Ignore your mom's needs--she is entitled to them, of course, and is probably imagining what it might be like if it was directly happening to her. But you can focus on your aunt.

My mother was like this, too. When my aunt died, my mother's behaviour at the funeral had me sneaking in weed to deal with it.\n\nYour mom needs professional mental help. It's not normal, healthy, or helpful for her to turn on hysterics and claim she can feel her sister's pain or her late nephew's presence. It's not healthy or normal for her to try to faint on command.\n\nI wouldn't believe her. She's not feeling your aunt's pain - if she were, she'd be subdued. She's feeling the pain of not being the center of attention. She's not feeling his presence, she just knows invoking his memory gives rise to emotions in the room she finds appealing.\n\nYour mother doesn't know how to handle emotion like a mature adult, period.\n\nI think you'll have more luck talking to your aunt.

I will try.", "That being said, though, I don't think the hurt OP feels from having to comfort others instead of being able to grieve themselves when their father passed, coupled with the fear/worry that their aunt will experience the same emotional hurt, OPs mother will be more understanding. This is just because I think OP worded their concern not optimally and maybe even a little harshly.\n\nThat being said, though, I don't think OP's mom should have been so disrespectful as to tell OP, who is also grieving a loss, to shut up. That is not good parenting in my opinion but, idk.", "We\u2019re home while my aunt had to travel to get to his body.

Help your aunt pls do but make sure you take the time for yourself too xx", "Oh I\u2019d love to, really. But whenever things happen everyone loses it and someone has to stand straight and solve things and that\u2019s often me.

Help your aunt 1st i understand how much you need too i really do. Just make a promise to yourself an for yourself to get help for your grief when the dust settles. Let family think what they will, this is something you need an deserve as soon as you can <3", "This is a tricky one. I'll say NAH. I lost a classmate when I was in high school and the whole class went to the funeral and burial. His mother was crying, but seemed calm in her grief. One of the aunt, however, tried to throw herself over the casket once it started to descend on the ground, crying her heart out. I don't think she was trying to be the center of attention. Everyone feels their grief differently.  \n\n\nIf you feel your aunt can't deal with your mom's right now, that's ok. You are there for her. But you can't tell other people their pain (whatever caused it) it's not appropiate.", "NTA circles of grief theory.", "NTA\n\n>My mother said that I should just shut up if I didn\u2019t know what to say.\n\n\"I do know what to say due to being in her position six months ago when I lost my father. I couldn\u2019t go through my grief because I was busy comforting everyone - despite being the one who had lost one of my most important family members. I do not want my aunt to go through that. So we need to step up, help aunt however we can, and grieve in private to not put anymore stress and worry onto her.\"", "NTA. Having been in your aunt's position of comforting everyone else it's beyond exhausting and your mom needs to stop making this about her. I'm so sorry for your loss and your aunt has my deepest condolences and sympathy. She's going through an indescribable Hell."]}
