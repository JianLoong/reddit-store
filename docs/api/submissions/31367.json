My mom and I (25F) were sat next to two young girls (19 or 20 if I had to guess) and who I assume were their mothers were seated in front of us. The girl sat directly next to me was on and off her phone throughout the ENTIRE first act, texting people and also googling the cast (these cast members were literally feet away from us in the flesh so idk why she felt the need to look at a picture of them on the internet\u2026) my mom glanced at each other every time she was on her phone until finally after the 10th plus time my mother, much more politely than I would, tapped the girl and asked if she would mind putting her phone away because it was distracting. The girl didn\u2019t say anything, made an annoyed face and put her phone away.\n\nDuring the intermission she was back on her phone snap chatting away, which didn\u2019t bother me because that is in fact a time where it\u2019s fine to be on your phone. However, when I had glanced at her phone I saw something that had me seeing red. She was responding to a friend who had asked her how the show was. Everything after this point is a bit of a blur because of the adrenaline but she responded something to the effect of \u201cfine, until this fat c*unt\u201d and then something rude about my mom asking her to put her phone away. I didn\u2019t even process before I looked at her dead in the eyes and went \u201cexcuse me? You\u2019re going to type vile things about my mother when I\u2019m sitting right next to you\u201d? She was seemingly pretty snotty and entitled and her only response was I shouldn\u2019t be looking at her phone. Which fine valid, but tight shoulder to shoulder seats, wandering eyes, shit happens and it\u2019s not like I can unsee what she wrote. We got into a heated argument (not screaming or anything, I was conscious about not causing a scene and getting kicked out - only the people around us would have heard). I repeated back to her exactly what she had said about my mother and this girls mother heard and got very upset with her and my mom asked me to stop so I did (she was very thankful after I explained the situation to her, but at the time had no idea what caused the arguememt). We sat next to each in alot of tension after not speaking, but my mom and I still thoroughly enjoyed the show and even got to meet some of the cast after.\n\nAlthough I guess I don\u2019t necessarily care what my judgement is because I defended my mother and called someone out on their bad behaviour and I\u2019m proud of that - but I\u2019m curious about what others thoughts are because obviously I shouldn\u2019t have been looking at her phone.

It's annoying and distracting to everyone around them.", "nta. you defended your mom when someone was being disrespectful and hurtful. it's understandable that you looked at the girl's phone out of curiosity especially when she was on it so often. she shouldn't have been writing such derogatory things about your mother while sitting right next to you. you handled the situation calmly and didn't escalate it further. your mom appreciates your support and that's what matters.", "nta (not the asshole). you were completely justified in calling out the mean girl for her disrespectful behavior. it's not okay for her to make vile comments about your mother especially when you're sitting right next to her. the fact that she was on her phone throughout the entire first act and even during the intermission shows a lack of respect for the performance and the people around her. you were in the right to defend your mother and stand up against her bad behavior. don't worry about looking at her phone it's not your fault that you saw what she wrote. keep your head held high and be proud of how you handled the situation.", "nta. you defended your mother and called out bad behavior nothing wrong with that. she shouldn't have been texting during the show and definitely shouldn't have been saying such vile things. you handled it in a mature way so good on you.", "NTA- In anyway. The 20yr old sure was though. If you at a play\\\\ a movie or really anything you spend money on to attend, you should enjoy the show and put the phones away... Alot of kids and adults feel lost without their phones and dont know how to unplug, even for a few short hours .\n\nGood for you, for standing up to rude childish behavior.", "NTA - the girl was acting very entitled.  She needs to learn some manners and apparently her mother agrees so you are in the clear.", "NTA at all! The audacity of that girl. But for the future - alert an usher when someone's on their phone during a performance. They are used to handling it, and it's a more \"official\" warning", "NTA - If someone has their dick out in a locker room, then of \\*course\\* you aren't supposed to look (or at least make those looks glancing).  If that same person has their dick out on the sidewalk, they don't really have that same expectation of privacy.  And if their sidewalk dick is tattooed with \"your mother is a fat c\\*nt\", then they \\*really\\* aren't entitled to take offense.  \n\n\nIf you are going to have your phone out at inappropriate times or in very close quarters with other people, then you should expect that your bubble of privacy is going to be pierced.", "Well since you don\u2019t care about any judgment from anyone \u2026 why do you care about what the stranger sitting next to you was texting? I am a little challenged to believe you were able to just \u201cglance\u201d at someone\u2019s phone & get all this information from that. \n\nIt appears you want validation that what you did was something you should feel proud about. If you think confronting another person about what they are texting on their phone is okay \u2026 then you do you. \n\nIt appears you & mom had a nice time, enjoyed the show & had fun afterwards. That\u2019s all that matters!\n\nYTA \u2014 it\u2019s simply just not worth your time or energy to worry about what total strangers are talking about. Doesn\u2019t impact your life in anyway.", "ESH\n\nYou should have had an usher deal with the phone situation. You also should not have been reading what is on someone else's phone. She was having a private text conversation that was none of your business. \n\nPeople need to learn to put their phones away and show some respect for others. After seeing and hearing what was happening, her mother should have switched seats with her.", "ESH. The girl was obviously very rude for being on her phone, but IMO your mom was also rude for confronting them about it, and you were rude for trying to read someone else\u2019s texts. \n\nI think this was not a battle worth fighting at any stage and you and your mom would have had a better time at the show if you would have let the theater enforce its own rules rather than deputizing yourselves as the phone police.", "ESH.

If she hasn\u2019t included the \u201cfat\u201d part I might have let it go, but my mom is very insured and sensitive about her appearance and it was triggering to see something play out in real time", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "Love this analogy lol", "I think because it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever confronted someone like this and am feeling a little extra sensitive since it was my mothers. My eyes definitely did hover when I looked and saw someone was asking her how the show was because there was still a very obvious tensions. I assure you this isn\u2019t a habit of mine haha. Also you are probably very right that I\u2019m seeking validation - nobody likes scenes and maybe I\u2019m wondering if it was worthwhile. But I do honestly believe I would feel a million times worse if I didn\u2019t say something", "I agree with what you said about myself definitely not polite. But disagree about my mother. Not like we were at a movie, people pay 100s for these tickets and one of the only rules at theatres is not to be on your phones during performance - distracting to others but also the actors. Should probably have tried hard to find an usher but again, there was none immediately near our area. Easier to tap someone and politely ask then get up move around and be distracting to others.", "That's insane. The rule at every single Broadway show is that phones are to be off. Not silent, not on vibrate, off. Confronting someone who was distracting you from the experience you paid hundreds of dollars to see is simply standing up for yourself, and in a world that is constantly and unendingly telling women to just shut up and take it... well, congrats on adding your voice to the world's shittiest choir. \n\nThat awful girl was wrong at every step. Confronting her and her terrible behavior was completely called for.", "I can\u2019t give you validation because I have a very different perspective. There\u2019s no right or wrong here. \n\nThere are a lot of assholes in the world. I choose not to waste my time on those people because I know I will not change them in anyway. Not every occasion deserves a reaction.\n\nI just don\u2019t care what strangers think about me. I also recognize they probably don\u2019t care what I think about them. We are in the same space right now but we will never see each other again. So you decide what works for you \u2026 you feel the need to say something. Go ahead! I personally don\u2019t waste my time getting into situations with strangers. I just don\u2019t care enough to engage.\n\neta \u2014 I (54f) also have a bit more life experience than you do & I do not have any issue with confrontation. I have learned from experience that it\u2019s best if I just don\u2019t engage. I end up kicking myself when I do because it just was not worth it.\n\neta more \u2014 if the woman had actually said something to you or your Mom directly then you\u2019re totally justified.", "Or you could have just watched the show and let an usher deal with it when they were in the area. I go to the theater all the time and someone being on their phone is definitely annoying, but it\u2019s not as big of a distraction as you\u2019re making it out to be. Yes the girl was wrong to be on her phone, but it was not an urgent situation that had to be addressed right that minute.", "The fact that you compared someone being on their phone during a show to sexual harassment/assault says it all.", "Fair opinion. But I do find it distracting especially when it\u2019s the entire time. Difference of opinion", "If you only think women are silenced when they speak about sexual harassment and assault, you are simply proving my point that you are an ignoramus.", "Yes I took this as women being silenced in general\u2026"]}
