My parents (56M + 56F) had me when they were 16, I lived with my grandparents (dad\u2019s parents) while they were in college, eventually they settled down and had other kids much younger than me, the second youngest child, my youngest sister, is 22 and is getting married this summer. \n\nDespite our age gap, I\u2019ve always been close to my siblings, and have been excited about my sister\u2019s wedding, but a recent argument has caused some issues for us. \n\nOur 14 yo, Dreyson, is a freshman in high school. He asked a girl out to the 7th grade dance 2 years ago, shortly after they started dating and dated for a bit over a year. Unfortunately, last summer she was in a car crash with a family friend and she did not make it. Her parents and Dreyson have stayed in touch and he\u2019s got some of her stuff, it\u2019s been tough on him but Dreyson has amazing friends who have helped him get though this. \n\nDreyson\u2019s girlfriend was Sri Lankan, while she and her parents were born in the US, her grandparents were not and she had connections to her heritage, both her and Dreyson loved sports, so they would watch cricket together and sometimes he\u2019d go over to her house and ate traditional foods.\n\nFor the 8th grade dance last year, she bought him and asked him to wear Sri Lanka flag cufflinks she saw online. He agreed to and it\u2019s something he cherishes as a gift from her. Note, our family is not Sri Lankan.\n\nDreyson has quite a few gifts from her, including clothes, but these cufflinks are the only thing that would be appropriate to wear at a wedding. As the wedding is approaching, we decided to start going suit shopping. Dreyson found a suit he liked, we got it tailored and got the ready version last week.\n\nDreyson is a very confident person and felt good about the suit and even posted some photos to Instagram. On Sunday, we were at dinner at our parents house, my sister and her fiance were there and he asked if they wanted to see \u201chis fit\u201d. They agreed to see what he was wearing to the wedding. I could see my sister\u2019s face change while looking at him and she shortly after asked to see me in private, she asked if he could not wear the cufflinks because they didn\u2019t match her wedding \u201caesthetic\u201d, when I asked her to elaborate, all she said was that she\u2019s going for a \u201ctraditional\u201d theme and when I nudged her she said, she didn\u2019t think the cufflinks matched a \"Traditional American wedding\u201d and said she didn\u2019t want anything that could cause people discomfort. \n\nShortly after that, we left and I spoke about it with my husband, who agreed with me that her request was ridiculous and we texted her saying he would be wearing them and if he couldn\u2019t, we would not attend. She texted our parents and siblings and it\u2019s caused a mess, some of our family is siding with us but others are saying because it\u2019s her wedding, we should respect her rules.
