I (38F) have an unusual domestic situation.  My best friend for my entire life has been Adam (38M). We\u2019ve known each other since we were babies. Adam is gay.  I was the first person he came out to and he was my roommate for a long time after his parents found out and things got ugly. He married his husband John (39M) who was also a close college friend of ours, so we\u2019ve all been tight for a long time. I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m not the marrying type, but I did want to have children and Adam and John also wanted a family, so we decided to kill two birds with one stone. We have two sons (6, 8), both of which are biologically mine and Adam and John are each the bio father of one of the boys. It\u2019s worked out way better than we could ever have hoped. This year we decided to go in together on a bigger house and live together. The boys are getting to the age that they could do with their own rooms and all us adults have been roommates before so we know we live well together, plus it would simplify things a lot. The boys love us all being in the same house and it\u2019s a good arrangement for everyone.\n\nAdam has been talking to his parents for the last couple of years and they are trying to repair the relationship. He has been feeling positive about it. He asked and we all agreed that they could come visit the Saturday after thanksgiving and meet the boys. Adam had already explained the living situation. Because we always thought of the kids as all of ours and the kids call us all their parents, it didn\u2019t really occur to me that the bio parentage would be an issue for Adam\u2019s parents.\n\nThings were ok and everyone was behaving until we put the kids to bed. I went to my room to give the others some space to talk. I heard Adam raise his voice a little, but decided not to get involved. Not long after, his mom knocked on my door and asked to talk. It boiled down to she and her husband wanted to know which of the boys was their grandson. They both favor me right now more than Adam and John, so it\u2019s not obvious. I had a suspicion that something was up so I told her that she needed to talk to Adam and John about it. They refused to answer the question because both boys are their children, so she wanted me to.\n\nIt turned into a really uncomfortable situation, Adam and his dad aren\u2019t speaking, and I\u2019ve gotten some messages from his mom trying to backtrack but also press for info at the same time. A friend of mine said that while it was smart to not disclose without consulting Adam and John, we\u2019re delving into AH territory by refusing to explain the bio relationships involved and it\u2019s not wrong for the grandparents to want to know especially since John\u2019s parents know. They only know because they were very involved with helping us with the pregnancies and when the boys were tiny since my parents are passed on, however.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701377183, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187soan/aita_for_refusing_to_tell_my_sons_grandparents/", "score": 2760, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This would be Adam's decision since they're his parents, and he told them no at this point.  So you were right to re-direct her.\n\nBut John's parents already know which kid is which, so it's not shocking that Adam's parents would feel they deserve the info as well.    \n\nYour sons will likely want to know at some point, and you said you will tell them.  If Adam continues to keep his parents in the dark, then the kids will have to keep the secret as well---that's a burden I wouldn't put on a child.", "NTA. John's parents get to know because they are loving and supportive and have been there from the start. Adam's parents will push aside and ignore the child who does not share their blood.

It was always very clear to me growing up which relatives saw me as not really one of the family. A lot of little extra treats and attention always found their way to the kids who were biologically related behind my parents' backs while I was left out, I was introduced as the adopted one, I was given second-hand toys while the others got brand new, stuff like that.\n\nI expect, as well, Adam\u2019s parents would want to have that child come over to stay for weekends and take him on trips and use that time to exert their way of thinking on him.

Keep protecting your babies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I do think people deserve to know who their bio relatives are mostly\n\nThe children should have access to that information as they get older for medical history purposes.

If there ever comes a time to disclose such information, it's Adam's responsibility to do so. \n\nIMHO, Adam is right in not disclosing this information. He knows his parents better than anyone.

They are proving that Adam was right to distance himself in the first place.  Even if they had completely changed into seemingly wonderful people I would be super skeptical and proceed with caution.

They have given you overwhelming evidence that they do not deserve to be in any of your lives.", "I'm like 98% in the NTA camp but the fact that John's parents know and Adam's don't is not ideal.", "I am confused about one thing - did they not know their son had a child?  Could they not figure it out just from what age the children are?", "NTA, not even slightly.  By my standards, the only AH here is the grandparent.", "Nta it isn\u2019t your place.

When someone asks they are OUR children.\n\nWhen my brother and his husband were discussing having children they came to my sister and myself for help.  They were still on the fence.  It would\u2019ve been a family decision.  So it would be my sisters eggs and I would carry since she has hard pregnancies and my BIL would be the other donor.  This way their children would have DNA from both of them.  In the end they decided they would adopt instead of IVF.  But we had a plan in place just in case.  We still have a plan if anything ever happens to either of them.  My sister or myself would gain guardianship and then relinquish custody to the surviving person.", "You're definitely not TA. I could see a valid argument for the bio dad being an A for not telling his parents, but it sounds like his parents are real homophobes that are going to treat the other kid like shit so I don't even think that's the case. The (grand)parents need to resolve this with their son. Eventually the kids will be interested in who is their bio dad, and the kids have every right to tell their grandparents whatever they want, but until such time comes, I'd say don't tell them anything until(/unless they have already) bonded with both kids and showed both kids the love normal grandparents give their grandchildren.", "NTA\nThere is zero reason for grandparents to know.\n\nOnly you, Adam & John & the boys\u2019 get to know the biological connection. \n\nI do recommend speaking to donor conceived people for any advice on ensuring the boys have open and transparent access to their biological information. \n\nYou sound like you have a wonderful family, all the best OP.", "Info: have they said why it\u2019s important for them to know which one they\u2019re genetically related to? Because you can usually get to the root of it as they don\u2019t want to get attached the one that\u2019s \u201cnot really their grandkid\u201d. \n\nI think its smart to present a united front and advise that you won\u2019t provide the answer. The whole reason Adam didn\u2019t have a relationship with his family is because they couldn\u2019t accept him. Sounds like they\u2019re still set in their ways and only want access to a biological grandchild.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for them to want to know which child is their biological grandchild. And I think you were a bit naive to think this wouldn\u2019t be an issue/wouldnt come up,\n\nBut if you think telling them will cause them to treat one better than the other, then they shouldn\u2019t be in the children\u2019s lives at all.\n\nEither way is a completely unsustainable situation as is. This will continue to be a thing until you tell them or until you cut them off.", "NTA.  But one way or another, they're going to find out.  It sucks, but they will.", "Urgh lord knows what plan to do with this info. The smallest thing playing faves with the bio worst trying to take custody in some deranged situation. They're both of their children and your so therefore it doesn't matter. If everything was all good between them all it wouldn't be an issue but clearly he feels the need to keep this quiet. Don't leave them kiddos alone with them god knows what they might try", "I wouldn\u2019t let those people back in the house, or anywhere near the kids again. They would probably try to sue for grandparents rights or for custody, or maybe even try to take off with him if they ever found out which kid was biologically their grandchild.", "This is a truly bizarre situation. I think you were right to defer to their asking their own son for the info and not you. Your loyalty is not to Adam's parents after all.\n\nNta, though I think it is strange for Adam not to tell them.", "Nta mom tried to run around her son and put you in the middle.", "NTA for staying out of it. It's not your place to disclose this to his parents. And in fact, I don't see why you even need contact with them. I would block them, personally. \n\nIt doesn't seem like they're doing much to repair the relationship with how they're treating this situation. They're allowed to have feelings about this situation. It's not traditional and not everyone would be used to it.

Both of the kids are their grandsons.  If they don't accept that, they can go away again.", "It's a little bit different of a situation though because technically only one of the kids is actually biologically related to them.

Not sure what is the issue here? One kids has a mother and father. The other kid has a northern father and a mother. Not sure what is the issue here and what is the reason to keep this information secret.  Very strange behavior!", "YTA - I\u2019ll preface what I\u2019m about to say by stating that I am a gay man.  I appreciate that I am dissenting from most of the viewpoints expressed here.  I think it is a good thing that society is more accepting of the often unconventional family situations of gay people, including having children.  You are open about your family situation but I do not think that who is the biological parent of each child is an irrelevant detail.  I think that the children have a right to know at the right time and similarly, the grandparents should know.  I do not think that society has reached a stage of evolution of making who one\u2019s bio family is has become irrelevant.  You are causing upset and aggravation for the grandparents for no excessively good reason.", "You three are free to do what you want or don't want. \n\n From the grandparents perspective I would want to know for legal reasons.  Writing my will I might want to exclude the non biological child from gaining anything from my estate after I die.  That would be well within my legal right as a grandparent.\n\nThe grandparents could also contact the other set and ask them.  So what are you going to do, tell them to lie?", "ESH - I\u2019m donor conceived and the secrecy here really bugs me. All this should be open because all of this should be treated like it isn\u2019t a big deal or a secret the kids will have to carry.", "NTA and I would not disclose. It sounds like they are still harboring issues that they need to work through. Involving the children is not an option. Good for you for keeping your family safe.", "NTA. Neither you or anyone else in your household owe them any explanation. They either love both boys equally like their dads do or they don\u2019t need to have a relationship with you all.", "NTA. They want to know because they clearly will favor the one that is the bio grandkid, which shouldn't be tolerated. So they can either accept both kids as grandkids or not be part of their lives.", "NTA - Genetics don\u2019t make a family. They don\u2019t need to know the biology behind the kids. All they need to know is that they have two grandkids. If family relations were normal, they\u2019d know by now! And it would just be part of life and family history. But because of their crappy attitude, they don\u2019t qualify as being in the \u201cneed to know\u201d group.", "NTA. Is it possible that the reason that they've decided to try to repair the relationship is because they heard they have a grandson? I'm not usually one to jump to conclusions. It just seems really odd in timing and would explain why they want to know which one is their grandkid. You are all smart to keep them at an arm's length until a true relationship can be established. This is information that they very well could try to weaponize if their intentions are not true in rebuilding their relationship with their son. He is right to be wary in their intentions and until he is no longer wary of them, they don't need to know specifics.

And I would never divulge this information to Adam's parents, because what will very likely happen is they will dote on \"their\" grandson and ignore his brother, which will, take my word for it, not end well for anyone.\n\nThe grandparents need to either accept that both boys are their grandchildren and treat them equally, or not be involved at all. It's a simple binary solution set.", "Yeah, don\u2019t tell.  Ever.   The \u201creal grandson\u201d will flourish and the \u201cother\u201d will see how unequal things are.

Both children are their grand children. Just as, has the children been adopted, they would have both been their grand children.", "Nice writing exercise", "NTA, but I disagree with everyone hating on the grandparents for wanting to know. They can want to know as much as they want, that's perfectly fine for them, it's really completely natural. If I were a grand parent, I would also only want to leave any assets/inheritance to a biological grandchild.\n\nThat being said, they are Adam's parents, so it's up to him to deal with them, and not on you to tell them any private information. If he wants his parents to treat both his children as their grandchildren, it's really not your place to counter that.\n\nThose parents are not related to you in any way they have no authority over you, you are not married, you are not in-laws, you just happen to be the mother to one of their biological grand children.

I (38F) have an unusual domestic situation.  My best friend for my entire life has been Adam (38M). We\u2019ve known each other since we were babies. Adam is gay.  I was the first person he came out to and he was my roommate for a long time after his parents found out and things got ugly. He married his husband John (39M) who was also a close college friend of ours, so we\u2019ve all been tight for a long time. I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m not the marrying type, but I did want to have children and Adam and John also wanted a family, so we decided to kill two birds with one stone. We have two sons (6, 8), both of which are biologically mine and Adam and John are each the bio father of one of the boys. It\u2019s worked out way better than we could ever have hoped. This year we decided to go in together on a bigger house and live together. The boys are getting to the age that they could do with their own rooms and all us adults have been roommates before so we know we live well together, plus it would simplify things a lot. The boys love us all being in the same house and it\u2019s a good arrangement for everyone.\n\nAdam has been talking to his parents for the last couple of years and they are trying to repair the relationship. He has been feeling positive about it. He asked and we all agreed that they could come visit the Saturday after thanksgiving and meet the boys. Adam had already explained the living situation. Because we always thought of the kids as all of ours and the kids call us all their parents, it didn\u2019t really occur to me that the bio parentage would be an issue for Adam\u2019s parents.\n\nThings were ok and everyone was behaving until we put the kids to bed. I went to my room to give the others some space to talk. I heard Adam raise his voice a little, but decided not to get involved. Not long after, his mom knocked on my door and asked to talk. It boiled down to she and her husband wanted to know which of the boys was their grandson. They both favor me right now more than Adam and John, so it\u2019s not obvious. I had a suspicion that something was up so I told her that she needed to talk to Adam and John about it. They refused to answer the question because both boys are their children, so she wanted me to.\n\nIt turned into a really uncomfortable situation, Adam and his dad aren\u2019t speaking, and I\u2019ve gotten some messages from his mom trying to backtrack but also press for info at the same time. A friend of mine said that while it was smart to not disclose without consulting Adam and John, we\u2019re delving into AH territory by refusing to explain the bio relationships involved and it\u2019s not wrong for the grandparents to want to know especially since John\u2019s parents know. They only know because they were very involved with helping us with the pregnancies and when the boys were tiny since my parents are passed on, however.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They will absolutely favor their bio grandchild. Since they have problems accepting their son\u2019s sexuality it doesn\u2019t surprise me. I can also see them saying stuff like \u201cthis wouldn\u2019t be an issue if you would have married a woman!\u201d Just keep telling them that\u2019s not your place to disclose that information. I can see your best friend going back to no contact with them.", "NTA. They want to treat the children differently.

You handled perfectly and your family sounds beautiful.", "NTA. If they can\u2019t accept BOTH of their grandkids, they don\u2019t deserve a place in their lives. They clearly still don\u2019t accept their son\u2019s marriage as they don\u2019t want to accept both of his kids.", "NTA this is why they showed back up. They haven\u2019t changed.", "NTA they are both their grandchildren biology aside. You do have a very strange living arrangement but honestly it sounds like it\u2019s working great for everyone. I think you have to sit down with Adam and John and have a discussion about the role his parents should play in,what is essentially,everyone\u2019s lives.", "NTA and exactly why do they want to know?  Not idle curiosity, surely, or they wouldn't be making such a big deal of it.  Do they want to treat one of them better?  Better gifts?  Inheritance?\n\nIt's no different than if John was married to a woman, they had one biological child and one that they adopted, would the parents treat them differently? I kind of think they would and they have no reason to know now.", "I'm in a petty mood right now, so here is what I would do. If they do not know the details of how the boys were conceived, I would them both John and Adam came in a glass beaker, the ones with measurement levels, a pour lip, and juice glass sized. Tell them you stirred up the mixture and used a turkey baster. Buy two, and if they ever cone over again, serve them drinks from them.", "NTA\u2014for every reason everyone else has said.  Also, I just want to say that your \u201cunusual domestic situation\u201d is fantastic!", "Nta, frankly I would answer and tell him the truth. Both of those boys are the grandson. Whether or not it's by blood. As an adopted person both your biological parents and your adoptive parents are your parents from my perspective. And since the one dad is the adoptive dad with each of the boys. They're both their grandchildren.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t their business.  Adam claims both boys. Therefore both boys are his. Probably safer to not tell because I can see his parents favoring their bio grandson.", "NTA\n\nThe parentage does seem to matter to them. It absolutely shouldn't. But as a grandma myself, I think it would be so fun figuring it out. There are obvious personality traits in my grandbaby from both of her parents. It shouldn't be hard for them to figure it out if they know their son.", "NTA \n\nThe grandparents immediately asked which child shares their DNA.   And when they didn\u2019t get it, they threw a fit.  That shows they are likely to weaponize that knowledge with interactions with the kids.   They could have waited for time to pass and ask when the relationship was better, but they didn\u2019t.  I believe their intent is to never see the other child as their grandson.\n\nThe children will know in due time. Keep doing a good job, your family sounds wonderful.", "NTA They only want to know so they can have relationship with their bio grandson. Telling them would allow them to play favorites and exclude the other child.

NTA", "NTA. You guys found a way to have a family that works for all of the adults and puts the children first. I love love this and I am happy for your little family. Don't tell them as it seems like they wanted this information to only be grandparents to the bio kid.", "NTA the grandparents are trying to undermine the fathers in this situation. Once they find out which boy is theirs, they will drop/ignore the other boy. This will create division in your family. Block the grandparents, this is NOT where you belong in this situation. These people are looking for a way to Crack and divide your family. Don't be the person who helps them.", "NTA. It's not your responsibility to tell them anything. They need to understand the olive branch can be yanked away if they cross lines.", "NTA. So these people, after not being in their son\u2019s life for almost a decade and just meeting their grandchildren for the first time are already asking very private information? Sounds like they need to crawl under their rock indefinitely. They do not have a right to this information and are causing problems with your family by putting you in the middle. Block them and let Adam deal with them, hopefully with a cease and desist.", "I remember reading about a mom who had bio and adopted children.  When someone asked which was which she just replied I can't remember.", "NTA. But I\u2019m surprised that Adam\u2019s parents haven\u2019t looked at baby and child photos of him and then look at the grandchildren to see which one looks like him?", "NTA. Both kids belong to all of you. It\u2019s easy. They can either have two grandsons or no grandsons. They either accept their son and how he chooses to live his life or they don\u2019t.

My youngest brother was adopted it doesn\u2019t make him any less my brother than the other 2 or less a grandkid or kid.", "NTA either both are their grandchildren or none are easy as that. They clearly want to only favour one of the children and that would be awful so you\u2019re being good parents by not allowing them to.", "counter action: tell them one is their grandson, but next time they come to visit say its the other one. and keep switching it everytime they come to visit. gaslight them into thinking their crazy.", "NTA\nCut those people OFF. \n\nThey do not mean any of you well. They're trying to decipher which target IS their grandson for nefarious reasons. They are despicable people.", "Nta. Let the guys deal with the information with their parents as they see fit. You don\u2019t owe these people anything.", "NTA and please don't leave the kids alone with Adam's family. They seem the type to do a DNA swab and then leave out the other boy despite everyone agreeing they are everyone's kids. \n\nOn a different note--I love you all have made your own family!", "Nta", "NTA. You\u2019re honouring your friend\u2019s wishes. That\u2019s what matters.", "NTA. They're Adam's parents, so Adam gets to dictate how much information is disclosed to them and at what dose. It was indeed smart to side with your fellow coparents on this.", "Do you think they're going to try to sue for custody?", "NTA stay out of it, first they will start bringing things and taking out \"theirs\" grandson, for there make hell. theres a reason they didnt had a relationship for all these years, revisit that and ponder if giving them this information will do any good for the kids", "NTA and your friends are wrong and using the \"but John's parents know, so it is only fair\" leaves out some history.  The reason John's parents know is because they accepted their son for what he is, Adam's parents didn't.\n\nAdam's parents only want to spend time with the child who is biologically related to them.  They only want to acknowledge that one grandchild.  That can be harmful to both kids.  Adam sees both boys as his, if his parents can't accept that, they don't have a right to be involved.", "NTA and yall should really consider limiting their contact and never leaving them with the boys for even a second. They WILL do a DNA test the second they get the chance to yank a hair out or swab a cheek.", "NTA! As far as his parents should know they are both their grandchildren they can accept it or walk away now", "NTA. Totally not the question at hand, but can I just say your household set up sounds awesome! 3 parents who love their kids and love each other and all get to hang out together all the time? Sounds like a seriously beautiful family that you guys have created.", "Absolutely NTA. The moment they know which child is biologically Adam\u2019s is the moment they\u2019ll try to start treating them differently, even if it\u2019s subconsciously. And it really shouldn\u2019t matter because both boys are their son\u2019s, period! \n\nI would either stop answering the calls/texts from them at the moment or keep reiterating that she needs to speak with her son and that you\u2019re not getting involved.", "NTA\n\nThey are just beginning to rebuild their relationship with their son.  That should be their focus.  Maybe someday, they will have earned the trust so that Adam shares this with them.  Meanwhile, they have 2 grandsons and neither deserve to be the favored bio-grandson (or worse, the unfavored one)", "Obviously their sperm was mixed together so nobody could claim to be a grandfather/grandmother, duh!!", "NTA", "Absolutely NTA. Best case scenario they're trying to alienate their non bio grandson. Worst case scenario,  like many have said, they're hoping to come after custody because they feel the parental arrangement will \"mess him up.\" Which, depending on where you live, could happen. Even if it didn't work it would be traumatic for everyone involved. \n\nI hate to jump in the no contact train..but..", "Nope, definitely NTA. Adam\u2019s parents certainly are. They\u2019re both his children, period. It takes more than just DNA to make a family, and it sounds like the five of you are family. If his parents can\u2019t accept that both boys are his sons, then perhaps they can continue to be estranged, because as soon as they know which one is biologically Adam\u2019s, that son will be favored over his brother.", "Therapy bills are gonna go crazy. Feel bad for the kids stuck with parents who can\u2019t be mature adults.", "NTA - It\u2019s none of their business if you choose to not disclose.\n\nI imagine it\u2019s for estate reasons (i.e. they plan on leaving everything to their bio-grandson and that\u2019s it).", "NTA. Both those children are their grandchildren, because those children have two fathers.", "A long time family friend and his husband had 3 kids. A boy and twins (m,f). They used the same surrogate. They also didn't disclose who was the bio dad. And no one cared! Everyone was just so happy they had the family they dreamed of. \nAs they got older, you could tell who the bio dad is since my friend has dark hair and dark eyes (think Antonio Banderas) and his hubby is very fair (think Jesse Tyler Ferguson). They have favored their dad's since birth but again .... NO ONE cared! Why would you not want TWO beautiful grandchildren???? \nNTA!

Stick to conversations about the weather & the state of the roads.", "NTA. Your friends who are comparing the right of the grandparents to know (John's versus Adam's) are ignoring the fact that Adam's parents *kicked him out because he was gay*. There is  nothing equal about the role Adam's parents have played in your lives compared to John's parents. They have no right to anything in Adam's life that he does not choose to give them, which absolutely includes information about his children's biological parentage. \n\nAdam's parents can kick rocks, honestly. Block them.", "NTA. This is between Adam and John and the in-laws.

I\u2019m betting 6 mos or so after finding out, they would start to be \u201cconcerned for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d considering all the \u201cstrange relationships & who else knows what\u2019s going on in that house.\u201d  Alarm bells all over this one!\n\nOh and tell the \u201cBut John\u2019s parents know\u201d crowd that yes, that\u2019s what happens when you actually care about & are involved in your children so lives.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but keeping in mind that the other set of grandparents know, and they can find that way, is better to just tell them, with the provision that they treat both children the same.

If they disagree with the relationship and how you 3 co parent they might try to pull the grandparent rights thing and take one of the boys, if they see him as 'theirs'. They all of a sudden are fine now with everything? No, these people seem the type to try pull some weird shit.", "Your kinda MIL and FIL are completely disgusting. The boys are brother in every sense of the way. They might have 3 parents, but they ALL are your sons. If Adam's family cannot understand that they have two grandsons and not just one and \"the other boy\", they can go dry asparagus. I recommend your three (and Josh's parents) to have a sit down and come up with some sort of white lie. You should tell them you went full-on Glee style and the fathers mixed their sperm and you don't know who is who's. You can already see that of they find out the truth, one child will be pampered and treated like a prince whilst the other one will be some filth you live with. (Please don't assume I think of either child as filth, just saying how their point of view will be). Tell them that since you don't know who's sperm was faster (please, go into a lot of detail so they get physically sick and stop asking), you all have two children.", "NTA - John's parents know everything because they respect and love all involved. Adam's parents have not demonstrated this and could use the information to be decisive: Why welcome this into your family?  Grandparents who are slowly connecting a shredded relation can be curious but why does this question carry so much weight to them? \n\nConsistent respectful chats and inclusion is the priority at this stage.", "Well well well", "NTA If the boys are brothers then they have no need to know. If they can't treat both boys as grandsons then they don't deserve to know.", "NTA.

They are not private information, they are public record. And they only cost \u00a311. An extra \u00a33 for the staff to search the records if you don't know exactly what document you need and only have some information (the kids name, mothers name, and year of birth *will* do to find it).

It's not an amount of money that would be a barrier \n\nBasically who is the father according to the birth certificate is not something you can hide.", "NTA oh absolutely not! They have zero right to know first off. They actually have zero right to be in either of their grandchildren\u2019s lives. Your friends were being kind, even trying to give them a chance at all, but they blew it the moment they decided only one of their son\u2019s children was their grandchild.

It sounds like you all are happy.", "NTA.  They will ice out the kid who is John's bio son.  Don't give them ammunition to pick an obvious favorite.  That will cause more problems than their irritation at not knowing.  They don't need to know.

Tubal ligation for contraceptive purposes is more common. \n\nOnly one sounds wrong, though. Maybe on the public system, I guess, but they're generally fairly reluctant to add on procedures that aren't medically necessary. Waiting lists are bad as it is.\n\nFinding a surgeon for tubal ligation or even outright removal of the fallopian tubes will probably be much easier, at least/especially if you go private. Just call around and ask their secretaries if they do it. Having a hysterectomy before menopause isn't something I'd recommend if you don't need one. There are drawbacks to it; your body likes to have the full set of organs it started with and has opinions about their removal.\n \nPersonally I'm of the view that if my body wanted to keep the organs I've had removed it shouldn't have let them try to kill me, and therefore it can shut up.", "Oh my goodness, where in Aus are you located? I'm 34, have one planned kidlet, and just got approved to evict my uterus in the next 90 days. I was expecting resistance but my doc was refreshingly supportive.", "It\u2019s not easy to arrange and not possible in all states, but it can happen in some places if a judge agrees that it\u2019s in the child\u2019s best interest. It took longer to set up than I would have liked and there are aspects that could be challenged if politics takes a nose dive and we get an AH judge, but anything that gives the kids more security is worth it.", "Adam\u2019s parents made contact with him first. They didn\u2019t know that he had kids or was married according to Adam. I feel sad about this whole business in part because I also grew up around Adam\u2019s parents, they were kind of honorary aunt/uncle to me, and were very kind to me when my parents passed away. It was a total shock to both of us when they kicked Adam out. As much as I was hoping they had grown and would do their best to make things right with Adam when he agreed to have contact, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve changed now. They\u2019ve just learned to hide it better. So I don\u2019t trust their motives with the kids to be benign right now.", "They really do.  They\u2019re wonderful with the boys, they love Adam, and they consider me a bonus DIL.  John\u2019s mom was an absolute godsend with both my pregnancies since my mom couldn\u2019t be with me and they\u2019ve spoiled both kids absolutely rotten since the day they were born.", "Based on your stated preference I\u2019m missing several important puzzle pieces.\n\nMy husband and I are pan so much easier.", "Not everyone is a backstabbing turd, my dude.", "Wow one of those not a surprise", "Trust also takes time. Adam and family opened up enough to let them in and meet the children. They blew it by being pushy and not taking no for answer. They should have backed off and taken things slowly and shown respect for the family.", "No, I haven\u2019t so I\u2019m going off the information in the post- including that they were NC for a long time. Trust takes time to rebuild. \n\nAlso, it seems likely they are spotting potential ill intent- that\u2019s why they don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s safe to share that information. It shouldn\u2019t matter to the grandparents, as both children are their grandchildren. It\u2019s a huge red flag to be making a huge deal out of which one is biologically related to them.", "And that criss crossed family tree. Sheesh.", "And it\u2019s likely that the fact they have a biological grandchild is the only reason they\u2019re willing to repair their relationship with their son.", "YUP. They definitely see whichever kid is \"\"theirs\"\" as their do-over kid and will absolutely ignore the other, and probably try to alienate their bio grandkids from his dads to boot.", "Being gay is NOT a preference, and while you may not have meant it that way, calling it a \u201cpreference\u201d is extremely bigoted", "This was my thought too. Like they may want to gain custody saying their grandson is being raised in an unsafe environment or something if they are gross bigots.

If some guy I'm with wanted children I'd be like cool--- there's the door.", "I had 3 kids, my husbands consent and they still didnt want to tie my tubes here  in PA because there are women that have babies at 40.

When it comes to parenting, it's important to set boundaries and not let your kids' grandparents overstep them. In my opinion, it's best to discuss family decisions with your partner and be on the same page with regards to how their grandparenting affects your children.", "It sounds like you are all really fortunate! :) \n\nToo bad Adam's parents can't get on board.", "I suspect they did blow it by being pushy. I don't see enough information to  conclude there was ill intent. It is likely that they will favor their \"bio\" grandchild as that seems to be very common in blended families.", "oh good point", ">I\u2019m curious if legally one child over the other would get preference\n\nIn the absence of an estate plan, biology wouldn't matter, but legal parentage would.

Thank you for pointing that out. I will correct the verbiage.", "Well considering that has been the norm during most of modern legal history that makes sense. Law does not evolve quickly.", "The legal system around marriage exists to determine property rights and inheritence because that's what the Romans invented it to do. Well yes, probably intended for people who could bear offspring, so heterosexuals but also for legal rights of adopted children, but probably male adopted children, who might also be gay, what do I know about every circumstance?

Any man who wants children is not the man for me. My now husband has teenagers with his ex wife. I\u2019m cool with it as long as I don\u2019t have to interact with them which thankfully I haven\u2019t. His autistic son is cool but the older one is an awful human being.

Especially if the biological father is an involved father and you are just not together.  You don't want the stepfather to be granted custody because you were married to him when the biological father really wants the kid if something happens to you.  This is less of an issue once the kids become teenagers and have more legal right to voice their opinion.\n\nAnd then the next issue you have is if you break up with the current step father and marry someone else... does that mean a 4th person gets added as a legal father.\n\nIt's a rabbit hole that can get quite deep when you start thinking about it!", "Correct", "What does human norms have to do with the law....? \n\nJk"]}
