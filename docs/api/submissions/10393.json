My MIL (in her 70s) wants to come visit us for four days (hasn\u2019t been here in over a year). \n\nWe have a second bedroom with an ensuite bathroom on the ground floor (my little on shares our room). Unfortunately, we only have an air mattress (although it\u2019s a nice auto inflate one). She refused and demanded to be put up in a hotel at our cost of nearly $1000 (this would be on top already having bought her a ticket to a famous and famously expensive amusement park ticket). She has no mobility issues. She says she doesn\u2019t want to sleep on the air mattress and doesn\u2019t like our dogs (very friendly chihuahuas). \n\nI told my wife it wasn\u2019t fair to ask for something like that (I offered to get a real mattress). She still refused and canceled her trip saying that my wife can come visit her (MIL is retired with basically no responsibility outside of feeding a cat. Wife is SAH but would have to travel with a fidgety 15 MO). \n\nMy wife is now mad at me because I thought it was not a fair request.

Your wife thinks it's fine, and you think it's too much. This seems like a disagreement that can be settled very logically by looking at the family budget together.

Surely she realizes that when she married you and made a child with you that baby and you became her nuclear family and she is supposed to put you and her child's needs above ALL else's...including her mother's.\n\nMaybe your wife has been trained to think that it's her job to regulate her mother's feelings and cater to her wants but that is absolutely not acceptable when you have a spouse and child to consider. $1,000 is a huge amount of $ to demand of somebody just for the honor of them visiting you. It was incredibly kind of you to offer to buy a \"real\" mattress as well. Gently let your wife know that MIL behavior is really selfish and no parent/grandparent who wants to spend time with their kid/grandkids would cancel a visit over this.  I'm speaking as a grandparent with 4 grandkids and I'd sleep on the fucking floor to see them. Good luck...I hope everything works out.", "I had thought no, but after re-reading am leaning to YTA.\n\nIt sounds like you simply don't like yr MIL.

At that age it's harder to get yourself up, so sleeping on the floor might well be harder for her in getting up from the floor than it would be for someone in their 50s. You're demeaning about her; saying she has \"no responsibilities\" outside of her cat, for ex. I don't think you have an appreciation about how simple tasks like getting groceries, cooking, and cleaning get more difficult as you get older. And since you don't live near her, you have no idea what her \"responsibilities\" really are.\n\nYou seem to be putting all the blame on her; doesn't want to sleep on a mattress, doesn't like your dogs (maybe they're not friendly to her), etc. I think you just don't like her and didn't want her to stay w/you regardless, and this is perhaps what your wife is picking up on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your wife is allowed to think that having her mom come to visit is worth the money.\n\nBut do you want your MIL involved in your kids lives at all? If she can't sleep on air mattresses, and can't afford paying for a hotel herself, this is the only option for her to see the grandkids every couple of years.

So you could probably save some money there.\n\nAnd even if you were to spend that much on the mattress, it would be an investment. The one time cost would mean a ready guest room for years to come.

No, if she is visiting, she needs to make her own accomodations if she isn't happy with what you are graciously offering to provide. \n\nYour wife also should not be travelling with a fidgety 15 month old just to appease her mother.

At her age there is significantly increased risk of a fall, and if she fell, her recovery time would also be significantly longer. In fact it could shorten her life considerably. I'm in my early 50s with no mobility issues, but I'm getting more conscious of difficulties standing up from a lower position. Balance, tendon laxity, and bone density all change with age. \n\nI don't think that she was being unreasonable in refusing the air mattress.
