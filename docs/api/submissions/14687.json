ESH.", "I've been homeless and at a shelter (Salvation Army) I made friends with a (ftm) guy, and given his situation, they allowed him to sleep in a room by himself. This was in Oklahoma, a fairly conservative state lol.", "Her parents used to use an extremely humiliating and inappropriate punishment where she would sleep on the couch naked with no blankets while they recorded her on a security camera when she would misbehave", "Why do you think kids like this frequently end up homeless? Their parents let the internet raise them so they're often a really interesting combination of sheltered/entitled in their expectations once they leave their parents house. \n\n\nWe took in a young person like this briefly. Because we felt badly for her. (She was over 18 though.)  She was an entitled lazy slob with no motivation to better her status as she had a roof (our roof) & that was \"enough\" for her. We had to kick her out after we realized she was not going to actually try to better herself/learn to be an adult in any way.(which is good for us because if she had figured out how to be an adult at all she would have realized we technically had to go through the eviction process instead of just telling her to go.)\n\n\n She INHALED our groceries & laundry supplies & literally didn't shower or brush her teeth no matter how many times we asked her to. She would also demand rides to places & act like it was our job to figure her schedule/life out. She hoarded our food in her room & trashed it in the short time she was in there. \n\n\nWhen she left we found a stockpile of food & a full \"booger wall\" she also stole items that I would have given her if she asked. I understand this was a trauma response for her & it wasn't her fault she wasn't raised properly but holy shit. She absolutely wreaked havoc on our house & it was the longest 20 days of my life. I don't blame op for being cautious. We took someone in similar to OPs son's girlfriend & she really fucked our house up for a minute.", "We have tried CPS numerous times for other abuse and they have done nothing.", "You're bizarre genuinely for thinking a parent can control who their JR/SR in highschool dates. \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 All op would get out of \"forbidding\" her son from dating this girl is a son who lies to her about who he's dating. LOL", "You need to contact CPS again then, and push this issue as far as you possibly can, get your son involved as much as you can.", "Omg, that is so awful!\n\nCan your son sleep on the couch then, since he's so invested in making this work?", "If the schools ADMIT they cannot meet the child's needs, this case is pretty extreme (even with attorneys who specialize in this area, it is a herculean task to get a school district to admit this as they are then REQUIRED to pay for alternatives to address the child's needs).  \n\nStart with the school and CPS.  The child may be abused,  or she may be fibbing to get what she wants, which is a chance to live with her boyfriend and not have to live with her own parents. \n\nKeep an open mind.  NTA", "Omg , i am petrified by the level of abuse she went through.\n\ni really hope there is a solution somewhere for her", "Well shit. I saw in another comment you live in a conservative state. Do you mind sharing which one?", "I get that we often can't choose who our kids associate with.  But you didn't read the OP carefully.  It's one thing to disapprove of a poor choice.  IT IS QUITE ANOTHER TO WHOLE-HEARTEDLY APPROVE OF IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\"I love this girl like she was my own daughter and I am happy that my son has found someone like her.\"\n\nThat's like me (a father) stating...\"I am so thrilled that my 15F daughter got knocked up by Andre, who just got paroled for murdering his pregnant wife.  I love that boy like my own son...\"", "Thats a good option. He could also get a part time job.", "Texas", "We don't know anything about the son. He could be on the same developmental level as the girlfriend. Your example doesn't work unless there's a chance your 15 year old daughter is also on parole for murdering her ex boyfriend...?", "I would reach out to all of these applicable [organizations](https://www.queerency.com/17-organizations-supporting-trans-kids-in-texas/) to ask for help.", "People tend to be an approximation of the average of the 3-4 people who they spend the most time, with, outside of work or school settings.  You say we don't know anything about the son.  That is true.  Can we not conclude that the girl might be someone you wouldn't want your son spending too much time with, though?   I think that's rather obvious from OP's description of her.  And the scary part is...the OP was being kind!!!!", "Yeah I'm not going in circles with you anymore. \ud83d\udc80", "NTA. But seriously this relationship is super concerning. Assuming your son is a junior or senior in high school, he will be graduating soon and moving forward with his life as a young adult, finding his place in the world. His gf on the other hand is several years behind with developmental delays, and lacks the capabilities to be left alone without consequences to her physical and mental health. \n\nThese two people are not compatible in their life stages right now. Whether or not she\u2019s able to consent (especially after your son reaches legal adulthood) she needs to be focusing on the basics of taking care of herself without a parental figure while your son needs to be focusing on gaining independence as far as choice of college, budgeting, personal opinions and views on bigger issues, decisions that affect his future. \n\nIf your son stays with her through his young adult development he will likely be far more focused on being a parental or caregiver figure for her as opposed to learning about his own needs and wants and how to balance them.", "NTA for having trouble working out how to handle this, it's a difficult situation. It'd be good of you to let her stay, but you definitely shouldn't be expected to pay for her mental health treatment, medications or schooling, that's still the responsibility of her parents.", "NTA.\n\nIt is possibly illegal for them to remove a 17 year old child from their home, especially if the child is still enrolled in school. Many state laws require parents to support their children until they have graduated high school, even if they turn 18 before graduation. The age can be even higher than 18 if a student is special needs.  I would contact the school and let them know what is happening, if you don\u2019t feel comfortable contacting the parents and letting them know you\u2019re aware of their illegal behavior.", "If this is in the US, they may not be able to kick her out until she's actually 18. I'd let the police and child services handle this one. I wouldn't want her to go back to a situation that would be at all unsafe for her.", "NTA but with everything you have described here are you getting the full story about her parents? This is obviously a shocking situation to be in, are they just done with caring for her and using this as an excuse? One of them must be their full time carer currently? Are they just fed up? Can they not afford the extras like vegan food themselves?  I can't help but feel there more to the version of events than this.\n\nYes her parents sound terrible, but they've clearly put a lot in so far.", "NTA but I think you should find some resources, since she and your son are not equipped to navigate this on their own. There are organizations that help homeless LBGTQ homeless youth, because unfortunately there are so many like her being kicked out of homes. Help them find resources in your area. There can be a plan, even if that plan doesn't include living with you.", "NTA, but maybe explain to your son that this is likely illegal. Ask if he's willing for you to be sent to jail over this. Emphasize that you're not abandoning his gf, she's still welcome in your home, she just can't live here because you are not legally her guardian, and she needs an actual guardian right now due to her learning disability.", "Nta\n\nCall cps on the parents, she is a minor so they can't just kick her out. And the amount of issues you said she has, they may not be able to just kick her out at 18 either.", "NTA. From what you say this is simply too much to take on, and it would be naive to think that anything \"temporary\" would work, she'll have nowhere else to go and you'll be burdened with the responsibility indefinitely. In Texas CPS is your best option, hoping you are somewhere civilized like Austin.\n\nYour son's request is emotional, not practical.", "You might want to call CPS or the school.\n\nI believe it is illegal to kick her out before she turns 18. Considering her developmental restrictions, there may be other familial constraints/obligations as well.\n\nNTA", "Woah. Nope, way above my pay grade. Next", "I guess technically NTA but she would literally be homeless if you didn\u2019t extend the invite\u2026 so morally Y T A", "NTA but she needs to make other arrangements", "NTA. Letting her live with you would be a mine field. Hopefully your son/gf understand why you say no.", "Held back doesn't mean she's mentally not 17, more likely it's that she's struggled with traditional school formats because of her conditions and that's impacted her grades", "Clearly he plans to live with her one day soon when he moves out, but this seems like way more than an 18 year old living alone for the first time can handle.  \n\nBut, she needs to explain to her son that legally they cannot take this girl in.  Sure - in other circumstances a 17 year old would probably go without notice living with her boyfriend, but she has far to many academic and mental health needs that require a legal guardian to handle.  Tell him that you will support her in other ways and you can help her reach out to CPS for support - but she is just not in a place where she can fly under the radar.  \n\nAlso tell him that if he really wants to make it work with her then he needs to be grown up enough to understand that all of these things have to be dealt with and cannot be ignored.  Her life has a lot of challenges and if he wants to face them with her he needs to recognize what they are and that they will impact him.", "If it's the US and she's 17, I don't believe her parents are legally allowed to throw her out.\n\nBut yes, there are serious issues of consent here.", "Why is the least helpful comment top comment...\nOP you need to get child protective services involved, and to contact the girl's school. You can have your and your son's best interest at heart but still help his girlfriend by supporting her and getting her the help she needs after being kicked out.", "The fact that this is the top comment sucks. Being held back doesn't make someone 'mentally younger', it means they struggled with the traditional public school system. Being autistic doesn't either. And if they're 17 then they're in high school, so it's not weird that they could meet at school, where 4 grades (or more depending on your school) are together.", "it's very condescending and ableist to immediately assume disabled/mentally ill = unable to consent, mentally \"behind\" in age or whatever.\n\nA lot of disabled people face very condescending random strangers thinking they have the right to interfere with them being normal human beings with romantic and sexual interests. Being behind in school doesn't mean she's cognitively a child.", "Info: OP can you answer the question?", "My thoughts exactly.", "Oh you sound like a person who would do that for for her. Okay no problem how about you put your hat in the ring and feed and house the girl. Because you must be rich or very much able to take care of a person with mental disabilities in all that so you must extend your hand. NTA because Opie makes valid points", "Yes, she definitely needs the help of professionals and there could possibly be funding as well as resources.", "When I was 17 I dated a girl who couldn't do math beyond a second-grade level.  She had never been held back, but I think that had a lot to do with the fact that her mother was a lawyer and very active about getting her every accommodation.  I can easily see her being several grades behind if she came from a family that was less willing or able to advocate for her.\n\nShe was actually very intelligent despite her learning disability and she would have been offended (and rightly so) if someone made assumptions about her ability to consent based on her ability to understand fractions.", "Legally, no but they do and they throw their kids out at 14 here, even younger at times if they\u2019re a really messed up family.", "OP never said she was \"mentally far younger.\" Autistic, mentally ill, and behind in school do not equate to \"mental age\" (flawed concept, by the way) or ability to consent.", "Multiple grades behind in school can be for many different reasons, like lack of support for a learning disability, and doesn't necessarily mean she has a low IQ or that she can't be in a relationship, or that the son is molesting an intellectually challenged girl. For God's sake.", "  Yeah, I could write at a third grade level and read at a college level in middle school due to an untreated learning disability.", "Yeah, a lot of these comments are super ableist. Not once in the original post was it implied that this girl is immature for her age. OP seems to have no problem with the romantic relationship in general yet all of these people are jumping to shitty conclusions.", "why do you care if internet people down vote you?", "Honestly though, when will she actually leave? What is the long term plan? If she moves in with you. She\u2019ll never leave.\n\nShe has no money so are you gonna have to take care of her? Does your son have a job to pay for her needs?\n\nNTA, i would definitely tell my son that I\u2019m sorry he feels that way, but long term, gf has no plans and you can\u2019t afford to pay for another child / adult.", "Yes!! Like there are SO many areas of development that you can be delayed in, and the ones that define consent are NOT the ones that get you held back in school. The assumption that because she\u2019s developmentally delayed must mean she\u2019s a dumb kid who can\u2019t consent is just ableist infantilization of people with developmental disorders.", "lol I don\u2019t especially care but if I\u2019m 90% sure my opinion will be widely disagreed with I just don\u2019t bother adding to the thread", "We're only on subs like this so we can rake in those sweet, sweet Internet upvotes, because the user with the most upvotes wins!"]}
