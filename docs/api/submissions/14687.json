Focus on the son's girlfriend, and the description of the son's girlfriend.\n\n\\-  Has problems with self-care and needs help for that\n\n\\-  Serious mental health disorders making her A DANGER TO HERSELF AND OTHERS\n\n\\-  Lots of food allergies, expensive meds (that apparently don't work), vegan\n\n\\- Several grades behind her age group, requires \"special\" schooling\n\n\\- Can't help with housework, but greatly increases the workload in relation to housework\n\nAs a parent, THAT is what you want your son to be involved with?!?!?!?!?!?   I stand by my original assessment.  ESH.", "I've been homeless and at a shelter (Salvation Army) I made friends with a (ftm) guy, and given his situation, they allowed him to sleep in a room by himself. This was in Oklahoma, a fairly conservative state lol.", "Her parents used to use an extremely humiliating and inappropriate punishment where she would sleep on the couch naked with no blankets while they recorded her on a security camera when she would misbehave", "Why do you think kids like this frequently end up homeless? Their parents let the internet raise them so they're often a really interesting combination of sheltered/entitled in their expectations once they leave their parents house. \n\n\nWe took in a young person like this briefly. Because we felt badly for her. (She was over 18 though.)  She was an entitled lazy slob with no motivation to better her status as she had a roof (our roof) & that was \"enough\" for her. We had to kick her out after we realized she was not going to actually try to better herself/learn to be an adult in any way.(which is good for us because if she had figured out how to be an adult at all she would have realized we technically had to go through the eviction process instead of just telling her to go.)\n\n\n She INHALED our groceries & laundry supplies & literally didn't shower or brush her teeth no matter how many times we asked her to. She would also demand rides to places & act like it was our job to figure her schedule/life out. She hoarded our food in her room & trashed it in the short time she was in there. \n\n\nWhen she left we found a stockpile of food & a full \"booger wall\" she also stole items that I would have given her if she asked. I understand this was a trauma response for her & it wasn't her fault she wasn't raised properly but holy shit. She absolutely wreaked havoc on our house & it was the longest 20 days of my life. I don't blame op for being cautious. We took someone in similar to OPs son's girlfriend & she really fucked our house up for a minute.", "We have tried CPS numerous times for other abuse and they have done nothing.", "You're bizarre genuinely for thinking a parent can control who their JR/SR in highschool dates. \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 All op would get out of \"forbidding\" her son from dating this girl is a son who lies to her about who he's dating. LOL", "You need to contact CPS again then, and push this issue as far as you possibly can, get your son involved as much as you can.", "Omg, that is so awful!\n\nCan your son sleep on the couch then, since he's so invested in making this work?", "If the schools ADMIT they cannot meet the child's needs, this case is pretty extreme (even with attorneys who specialize in this area, it is a herculean task to get a school district to admit this as they are then REQUIRED to pay for alternatives to address the child's needs).  \n\nStart with the school and CPS.  The child may be abused,  or she may be fibbing to get what she wants, which is a chance to live with her boyfriend and not have to live with her own parents. \n\nKeep an open mind.  NTA", "Omg , i am petrified by the level of abuse she went through.\n\ni really hope there is a solution somewhere for her", "Well shit. I saw in another comment you live in a conservative state. Do you mind sharing which one?", "I get that we often can't choose who our kids associate with.  But you didn't read the OP carefully.  It's one thing to disapprove of a poor choice.  IT IS QUITE ANOTHER TO WHOLE-HEARTEDLY APPROVE OF IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\"I love this girl like she was my own daughter and I am happy that my son has found someone like her.\"\n\nThat's like me (a father) stating...\"I am so thrilled that my 15F daughter got knocked up by Andre, who just got paroled for murdering his pregnant wife.  I love that boy like my own son...\"", "Thats a good option. He could also get a part time job.", "Texas", "We don't know anything about the son. He could be on the same developmental level as the girlfriend. Your example doesn't work unless there's a chance your 15 year old daughter is also on parole for murdering her ex boyfriend...?", "I would reach out to all of these applicable [organizations](https://www.queerency.com/17-organizations-supporting-trans-kids-in-texas/) to ask for help.", "People tend to be an approximation of the average of the 3-4 people who they spend the most time, with, outside of work or school settings.  You say we don't know anything about the son.  That is true.  Can we not conclude that the girl might be someone you wouldn't want your son spending too much time with, though?   I think that's rather obvious from OP's description of her.  And the scary part is...the OP was being kind!!!!", "Yeah I'm not going in circles with you anymore. \ud83d\udc80"]}
