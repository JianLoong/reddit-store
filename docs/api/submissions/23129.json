She's not the one that needs quiet. She cleans and has to make sure she closes the cabinets softly. That's exhausting and just too much man. Obviously it's understandable that you need quiet but you should be the one hanging out in the soundproof basement so that the rest of the household can actually live. It's their home too.

But she is right, you are being controlling. If she is making too much noise you can just leave the room, especially if she is cleaning up. Kitchens are noisy places there's not really a way around that. Dogs are loud, you chose to have them. Also its easier to listen to sounds made by yourself than by other people so you may be just as loud as her but you don't notice it because you're in control of it. \n\nI live with my parents, they are aware that I struggle with noise. They tell me when they are going to make a loud noise (eg loading the dishwasher, blender) so I can either leave the room or put my fingers in my ears. But I'm also aware that when my dad is mowing the lawn, I need to use my noise cancelling headphones because I can't escape that noise.\n\nI think the issue is you have the problem and you're asking her to change her behavior to fix it. It is completely reasonable to say if she is coming into a space you are in that she quietens down, but you cannot enter the louder rooms of the house and expect silence. Can you designate a room of the home to be a quiet room? Or perhaps use the basement since it is soundproofed. This way she doesn't always have to worry about being quiet but you still have a space to relax.\n\nJust as a side note, if I was doing chores and they were done to an acceptable standard but someone didn't like the way I did them and demanded I changed it would piss me off. I think that is what she is talking about controlling. You can ask someone to pause for a minute while you leave if the situation is overwhelming but let her get on with her day. Its not really up to you how she plays with the dogs or uses cupboards, just leave the room. If she wants you in the room while she does these things then she has to do them more quietly. My mum doesn't listen to the radio in the kitchen because I'm less likely to come downstairs if it was on. I say that she should listen if she wants and I will just tell her when I want to come down but she knows I'm more likely to spend time with her if she doesn't play music. If I demanded she didn't play music that would be controlling but I encourage her to do what she wants and what she wants is for me to feel comfortable. See what I mean?", "She didn\u2019t listen the first several times you told her.  I think you did a great job of demonstrating the problem.
