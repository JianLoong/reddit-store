Good luck.", "NTA, this is where she should have apologised for not believing you", "NTA.  Honestly, that was a really smart way of showing her.    She's not embarrassed because you're 'controlling', she's embarrassed because she realizes she wrong and doesn't want to admit it.\n\nYou shouldn't have had to do that.   I prefer a quiet home simply because I'm sensitive to loud noises, my whole fam damily knows it, and you know, respects it.   To the point that if there's a loud noise people come scrambling to find out if something has broken or someone has been hurt.      You shouldn't have to prove a need to receive basic respect.", "NTA\n\nYou told her many times, but she didn't listen.  Now she feels \"insulted\" and \"controlled\" because of your demonstration?

And claim to have made attempts at verbally explaining yourself. \n\nYour method probably did make her feel small, but she wasn\u2019t getting the point otherwise. And she\u2019s lashing back out a bit for having that thrown in her face. \n\nThat said, no one can live a completely quiet existence, noise can be a sense of joy for a lot of people; like playing your favorite song loudly. If the space exists somewhere, I would suggest an actual nearly sound proof room that\u2019s literally just big enough for a recliner. Like a little isolation chamber when the world is just too much, go in there for like 20 minutes.

It's \"my\" home, she has \"free rein\" of ***your*** house and finances. Nowhere in this post is it \"our\" house or \"our\" finances.\n\nYour noise situation and desire for quiet, totally reasonable. Hyper-focusing on things like cabinets? Notsomuch. Household noise happens. Doing dishes is a normal household behavior. Telling her, and your dogs, they can only exist in the basement is pretty controlling.\n\nThis feels like either an ESH or NAH, because I get where you are coming from and wanting pure quiet is SUCH a need after working in a loud environment.

You call it \u201cyour home\u201d when your gf also lives there. 2. You want it to be quiet the entire time you are home. You talk so much about this soundproof basement. Why don\u2019t YOU go down there for an hour or two after you get home and let your gf go about her day. You are the one with the issue.

She's not the one that needs quiet. She cleans and has to make sure she closes the cabinets softly. That's exhausting and just too much man. Obviously it's understandable that you need quiet but you should be the one hanging out in the soundproof basement so that the rest of the household can actually live. It's their home too.
