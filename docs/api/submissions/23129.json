Also, if you need quiet after work so much instead of your household having to walk on eggshells... I mean, she can't even play with the dogs without having to isolate herself. She's not the one that needs quiet. She cleans and has to make sure she closes the cabinets softly. That's exhausting and just too much man. Obviously it's understandable that you need quiet but you should be the one hanging out in the soundproof basement so that the rest of the household can actually live. It's their home too.

YTA, moving around a house makes noise.  You want it quiet then put in the plugs and put on the muffs or take your lazy butt to the basement.  I've worked where you had to have both of those also, and there is no issue going beyond 85 decibels if you're using quality plugs and muffs.

She hadn't heard you when you spoke.\n\nThe only way you are \"controlling\" her is that you are controlling your environmenl home because you you work in a noisy environment.\n\nThink he is unhappy because she didn't understand what your dealt with and she can no longer make loud noises.\n\nNTA", "Look I have hyperacusis it severely impacts my day to day life so I do get your situation. But she is right, you are being controlling. If she is making too much noise you can just leave the room, especially if she is cleaning up. Kitchens are noisy places there's not really a way around that. Dogs are loud, you chose to have them. Also its easier to listen to sounds made by yourself than by other people so you may be just as loud as her but you don't notice it because you're in control of it. \n\nI live with my parents, they are aware that I struggle with noise. They tell me when they are going to make a loud noise (eg loading the dishwasher, blender) so I can either leave the room or put my fingers in my ears. But I'm also aware that when my dad is mowing the lawn, I need to use my noise cancelling headphones because I can't escape that noise.\n\nI think the issue is you have the problem and you're asking her to change her behavior to fix it. It is completely reasonable to say if she is coming into a space you are in that she quietens down, but you cannot enter the louder rooms of the house and expect silence. Can you designate a room of the home to be a quiet room? Or perhaps use the basement since it is soundproofed. This way she doesn't always have to worry about being quiet but you still have a space to relax.\n\nJust as a side note, if I was doing chores and they were done to an acceptable standard but someone didn't like the way I did them and demanded I changed it would piss me off. I think that is what she is talking about controlling. You can ask someone to pause for a minute while you leave if the situation is overwhelming but let her get on with her day. Its not really up to you how she plays with the dogs or uses cupboards, just leave the room. If she wants you in the room while she does these things then she has to do them more quietly. My mum doesn't listen to the radio in the kitchen because I'm less likely to come downstairs if it was on. I say that she should listen if she wants and I will just tell her when I want to come down but she knows I'm more likely to spend time with her if she doesn't play music. If I demanded she didn't play music that would be controlling but I encourage her to do what she wants and what she wants is for me to feel comfortable. See what I mean?", "She didn\u2019t listen the first several times you told her.  I think you did a great job of demonstrating the problem.  So, why continue to date, or allow her to live in your house if she can\u2019t respect your request? NTA", "NTA. Dump her. why the hell are you with her?  She does t respect you or care for you.", "Have you tried Loopz?

If noise at home bothers you so much, your GF should at least try to be quieter. \n\nI think your video was a great idea. Quite the education for her, since she had such trouble understanding. If she felt childish, maybe it was because she realized that she was being childish.", "I was wondering when the usual equivocating commenters were going to pick an insignificant part of the post to laser in on. \n\nAt *no point* is OP rude to his girlfriend. He doesn't lash out. He doesn't yell. He doesn't 'get even' by making a racket while she's relaxing or calming down. He doesn't ignore her or bail out on her to go somewhere quieter.\n\nHe tried communication. He tried communication *again*. He tried soundproofing the house and making places for loud noises in the house. He finally talked to her, asked her to experience what he experiences on a daily basis, and she agreed. She couldn't even get to the level he is regularly exposed to! Then, even when *she agreed that the sound was a lot*, she couldn't just apologize, and had to complain about feeling like she was being treated like a child despite *every possible step* being taken for him to ask for the smallest amount of consideration that should be a baseline for any reasonable relationship.\n\nBut sure, he's an asshole because he used 'my' instead of 'our' when talking to internet strangers. Do you *never* use the wrong words in conversation? This isn't a court room.", "> remain silent for the rest of the night\n\nOh yes, exaggeration.\n\nAsking her not to slam cupboards, rile up the dogs, and make a ton of noise doing dishes is in no way expecting someone to be silent.\n\n You don't have to walk on eggshells to be respectful of other people in the household."]}
