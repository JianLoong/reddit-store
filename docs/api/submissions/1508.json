I\u2019m on mobile. \nAnd sorry if it\u2019s a little hard to read. I\u2019m still upset\n\nEdit; I pointed out my husband is a good partner in the comments. This situation and for I said is more for when he\u2019s not working cause this happened on his day off. I don\u2019t expect much from him on his working days minus one diaper change\n\nFor context; I(F22) and my husband(M26) just had a baby three months ago. I\u2019m a SAHM and he works to provide for us. I don\u2019t get much \u2018me time\u2019 and we just got into an argument so I feel bad. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. \n\nSo me and my husband woke up today and he went and did errands while I stayed home with the baby. He came home and told me I can play apex for a few hours on the pc while he watches the baby. I was 100% on board with this since I haven\u2019t played in awhile without having to worry about the baby.\n\nSo I was playing the game and while doing so he kept saying things in a joking manner like for example; my aim is bad, I\u2019m blind for not seeing the other player, I really gotten bad at playing games all of a sudden and what happened. Stuff like that. Usually it doesn\u2019t bother me cause I really don\u2019t care but the jokes were more often than usual and I gotten upset with him. I told him I would still be good if I had the opportunity and time to play more but I don\u2019t since I have to watch the baby all of the time while he just comes home from work to play the game and then sleep or get on with his friends. Told him we don\u2019t spend any time together either of just the two of us. Or even to chill with the baby. You just work, sleep, eat, play. And a bunch of other little petty things. \nSo he didn\u2019t say anything other than to tell me to be quiet and to shut up(playfully). But then a few minutes later he texted me to take the baby and to get off. \n\nHe got off the phone with his friends on discord and that\u2019s when the argument happened. He said \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have never said any of our personal life on the phone with his friends. I embarrassed him. His friends think he\u2019s probably a shitty father and husband now and that he doesn\u2019t do anything. Which isn\u2019t true you know how I am and I say things jokingly to you and my friends. And if I\u2019m so unhappy I can just leave. You know I\u2019m trying my hardest to give you some time but it\u2019s hard when you are the only one working and have the financial burden on you\u201d. Then I started again with saying how I never get alone time with him or me time. I was just upset that he kept doing it. And how I just wanted to play and not have that in my ear. Since I never get to play really and this is how women after birth get really depressed because it\u2019s the baby 24/7. \n\nHe left the room after that and just texted me he hates me and that he wished I didn\u2019t say that stuff cause he feels embarrassed and awful. And if I\u2019m so upset we should just talk and figure things out \n\nSo I was wondering if AITA for saying some of our personal information with him on the phone and causing an argument.", "created_utc": 1667627150, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymlh1q/aita_for_accidentally_saying_things_about_me_and/", "score": 10, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But oooh boy did he have it coming.", "ESH\n\nMainly because you both lack communication there. \n\nHard situations need alot of communication and having a kid is hard af. So talk more about what your needs are before blowing them up in everyone's face.", "NTA He's more upset about his friends knowing he's lazy than his wife being overwhelmed. He says you should have talked to him about it like he didn't notice that he was having fun on his days off and you were having none. He noticed, he just didn't care until his friends found out. He was also mocking you in front of his friends. \n\n  However, you obviously need to be more vocal and stand up for yourself instead of losing your cool when he teases you. Tell him you don't want to get into the habit of 'asking' him to do things like change nappies etc, tell him you want both of you to know the baby's daily schedule, medical appointments etc and you don't want to have all the mental load of that. Tell him you also want to look after each-other too, as equal partners. He could completely change and you could have a really happy life together but so many relationships end up becoming parental rather than romantic when spouse ends up just being another child to look after. Nip it in the bud now, with an honest conversation.", "I may be in the minority here, but you don\u2019t need to keep his inability to be a partner and parent to yourself. You say he\u2019s a nice guy, but when is that? When he\u2019s at work, playing with his friends, or sleeping?

I get that having a baby and family can be stressful and you may not have your own time now. Your baby is just 3 months old. That\u2019s part and parcel of having a family. You chose it. You are looking for \u201cyou\u201d time as well as \u201ccouple\u201d time but you have to realize that when you started having a family, having less time for those is part of the package you signed up for. Now, if your husband is having as much \u201cme time\u201d as he wants and you are left doing the heavy lifting, that\u2019s a different story.", "ESH Why didn\u2019t you unload on him in private? How would you feel if he said things about you when your friends could hear him?", "Info: are these things you said on the call true?", "ESH\n\n * Him for, well, what you said.  A new baby is stressful on everyone and he needs to do his part to help you.\n\n * You for airing your private laundry in public.  Your title said \"accidentally\" but there was nothing accidental about this.  You got mad and you lashed out.", "Info: did you know he was on the phone with friends?", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't put dow or criticize a spouse in front of other people. That is what a relationship is about.\n\nYou recently had a baby and your hormones are still all over the place. You sound overwhelmed, and depressed. You watch your husband pretty much living the same life that he had pre baby and your whole live has been turned upside down.\n\nYou guys need to come together and communicate. The baby is your job for 8 or 10 hours while he is at work. Once he is off work, so are you. Just because you are SAHM mom, doesn't mean that your job is 24/7. \n\nOnce your husband is off work, everything becomes 50/50. You take turns doing the jobs at home and you take turns having the fun. This is what you need to discuss. \n\nCongratulations on your new bundle.", "YTA - in other comments you pointed out that he is always helpful as a partner and if he can help you with the baby (changing diaper etc.) then he does that. You pictured on the phone a deadbeat father. Yes you spend more time with the child but isn't that why the workload and the stress of keeping the job is more on him and that is the concept of one parent staying home and the other parent working?", "He\u2019s a good partner always. When I gave birth, he did everything for me when I came home from the hospital. It\u2019s just for this, I guess I got mad and like another commenter said, lashed out.", "That\u2019s true. We both say this but then don\u2019t proceed on doing that", "I\u2019ll take this to heart. Cause I do have to remind him about the baby\u2019s appointments, even mine. I could tell him the day before and he\u2019ll forget the next day. I really do not want to end up once of those couples that aren\u2019t together anymore because of this", "He does do stuff. For example, he prepared the baby\u2019s room all by himself. Even painted it. He took care of everything when I gave birth and came home to heal up. On his workings days I don\u2019t expect much from. Since he\u2019s working those days and I know he needs rest. It\u2019s more on his days off he kinda forgets that I want me time", "I wouldn\u2019t like it either. Nobody would. I just don\u2019t think sometimes when I\u2019m upset and angry.", "Yeah", "He does do his part. When I ask him to change the baby. He does. When I ask him to watch the baby to make a bottle or to go to the bathroom. He does", "I did. Cause he kept talking while he was on the phone with them but he was also making fun of me while he was in the phone", "Thank you. I did talk to him about that before pre baby but it kinda disappeared from his brain", "Yes. This situation was more about the fact that on his days off I still don\u2019t get any time by myself or with him. Like I can\u2019t walk to the farmers market by myself cause he would rather me take the baby with me", "So you lied? If all he does is sleep eat and play he\u2019s not a good partner always.", "Communication isn't always a natural thing. If I may, the best way I found for keeping the communication line open is creating these moments. \n\nThe key phrase for us is \"Hey ! Is there something you want me to work on that's been bothering you ?\". It might be tough to hear at first but when it's said with love and intentions to make things better it's easier received. Then the dialog is open and the problem solving begins. \n\nIt works very well in my relationship, maybe the idea could help in yours.", "So he was nice several weeks ago, and now he calls you a financial burden. He works some 40 hours, you child rear (a paid job when done by anyone else) 120 hours plus some on the weekends. This isn\u2019t the 1950s. A lot of men, dare I say most, are active parents on weekdays too now. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through it, I\u2019m more sorry that you\u2019re telling yourself that it\u2019s no big deal.", "Some things you can\u2019t just talk out yourselves. He\u2019s going to resent you for this and you clearly already have resentment towards him. It\u2019s probably best to involve a marriage counselor.", "Nta, he should be more concerned about his actual value as a father than what his friends think", "You shouldn't have to ask. He needs to step up on his own. This is his child and you're not the cruise director of the house. He needs to learn when to change the baby, learn the baby's schedule. He shouldn't need instructions whether you play a video game or leave the house for a few hours. He's not a babysitter. He's a father.", "Well in that case, YTA lol.  I assumed you were at least telling the truth when \"airing your dirty laundry\".  Serves me right for assuming.  \n\nThank you for the correction.", "He needs to realize that he is the father. He is not your helper or babysitter. He needs to recognize what the baby needs and to just do it without being told. He isn't taking responsibility. You need to be able to walk out the door and know your baby is being cared for by it's father.", "Then that changes the situation and my judgment to ESH. He should also keep time with his days off, because you also can't get an day off as a SAHM. Still not nice from both of you to do that on the phone but it is more understandable from your point now. Judgment still also on you, because you could have communicated that in a better more neutral situation. \n\nI suggest to plan time off, like on weekends as long as the child needs constant supervision, Saturday is mom's gaming day and Sunday Dad or something like that. Because you sound a little depressed and something weekly you can be excited for (e.g. Your hobby/gaming) can help. It is important to not lose yourself being a parent, you are still a person.", "I guess? Me coming home for the hospital was three months ago and when I recovered it was mainly me taking care of things", "Thank you. I\u2019ll take this advice. Right now he\u2019s on vr with his friends and I\u2019ll try to talk to him when he comes upstairs or in the morning using this phase", "Thank you. I\u2019ll try to talk to him about that but he doesn\u2019t like counselors or therapists so it\u2019s a hard subject", "Have a look at these and the discussion in those threads. I don't know what to think about this situation.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymlh1q/aita_for_accidentally_saying_things_about_me_and/iv4hrbt?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymlh1q/aita_for_accidentally_saying_things_about_me_and/iv4iv7t?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3", "He changes the baby when I ask him to or watch the baby to get a bottle. But he does ask me questions sometimes about the baby if the baby is crying and hungry or if tired", "You\u2019re welcome. I was more upset about not getting like actually \u2018me time\u2019 while he gets hours of it and changing the baby for example only takes a minute. I don\u2019t even get time to myself on his days off. This was just one occasion since I been taking about playing this new character but I accept your judgement", "Wouldn\u2019t have any \u201cdirty laundry\u201d if he did his part. Not to mention the dude is getting more upset she said that stuff in front of his friends than the actual problem at hand, taking care of his baby. It\u2019s more about him than anything. And clearly he\u2019s not fully \u201cdoing his part\u201d if OP still doesn\u2019t have time to do things that she likes, and he really doesn\u2019t spend time with her and him and/or the baby included. If he really does just come home everyday to change a diaper and watch the kid while she goes to the bathroom and then goes to eat, play games, and go to bed there\u2019s a lot more \u201cdoing his part\u201d the guy can pick up on with his days off", "That\u2019s true", "I accept the judgment. We had a talk about that pre-baby but when the baby came it kinda got forgotten in his head", "That\u2019s when you tell him to suck it up and get his ass to therapy with you or prepare for a possible divorce.", "Thank you for sending that even though it seemed to scramble my brain.  I also kind of assumed she didn't know he was on the phone because who would do that? One thing from this is so many couples just aren't on the same team. Why embarrass your partner? Imagine it was a business partner, you wouldn't put the relationship or the brand at jeopardy.  I can say she needs to control her emotions better . And she needs to evaluate if he truly is a wonderful partner when there's big problems there.", "Tell him to figure it out. Don't jump in and save him. He needs to learn why a baby cries. Hungry, dirty diaper, tummy ache, maybe too cold or warm. Give him the baby and make him figure it out. Stop rescuing him and taking over.", "I tell him the first part all the time. I love him very much and I really don\u2019t want to leave him so i try to find a solution without the divorce", "Of course you don\u2019t want a divorce but the truth is if he isn\u2019t willing to work on y\u2019all\u2019s resentment issues, that\u2019s exactly where you\u2019re headed. A marriage will never work if one person isn\u2019t willing to put the work in.", "You are correct. I\u2019ll try to talk to him and to see if he\u2019s open to talking to someone", "Good luck!!"]}
