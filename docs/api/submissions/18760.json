Does he always coordinate a big party?", "NTA as you\u2019ve got a lot on your plate right now. \n\nI will state maybe you should have expressed this to him as he\u2019s used to big things on this day and you were aware you wouldn\u2019t be able to do that this year.", "NAH \n\nYour boyfriend is used to more effort for his birthday. You didn't let him know that your plate was too full for that this year so he was disappointed. \n\nShould he know you are busy - yes. Does that exempt you from communicating and therefore managing his expectations? No. \n\nShould he be grateful for the effort you made? Absolutely!\n\nDid you ruin his birthday? Doubtful, he is likely overreacting. But since you are both parents of a young kid, you are both tired I'll give you both a pass for being tired humans that forgot to have a conversation and then ended up in an unnecessary disagreement.", "INFO:  What part did he consider \"ruining the birthday\"?  The lack of party or was there a lack of gift etc... as well?\n\nIf it's lack of party, then he's being an AH because now isn't the time and it's tough for new parents.\n\nIf there was nothing but the meal... then he may have a point... albeit a hyperbolic one.", "Sounds like you two aren\u2019t communicating well.  Were they surprise parties previously?  And\u2026 just out of curiosity what does he do for your birthday?  A big party?", "NTA. Could you have been more upfront and given him a heads up before his birthday that you didn\u2019t plan a big blowout party? Sure, but he definitely knows all you put up with between working and caring for a brand new human being. The level of anger on his part is just obtuse.", "**NTA.**  New moms absolutely get a pass on all sorts of things, and he's being the baby now.  Yes, it's really dislocating to have both of your worlds now centered around your daughter, and not just each other, but ... he needs to be much more understanding here.  You did fine.", "im going with NTA but- you probably should have let him know ahead of time that it was going to be a simple dinner, that you didn't have time or energy to plan a celebration. He might have been able to make arrangements with fellow friends or family to help him celebrate and take the burden off you, but because he was used to expecting a party and you didnt warn him, its reasonable that he was underwhelmed, again, ur NTA, but something to consider.", "NTA. There should be a point in everyone's life, especially after having a child, that we all get over ourselves and don't have a tantrum when our birthdays aren't treated like national holidays. If he wants to do a big thing, he can plan it himself. Meanwhile, you working, taking care of his child, and cooking his favorite dinner should be more than enough. Does he consistently throw you a massive party for every birthday? Cook you special meals? Buy you extravagant gifts? Even if yes to all of the above, if you have an infant at home \"I'm tired and busy but still cooked your favorite meal from your Mama's recipe\" is 100% enough.\n\nETA: And I'm going completely against the rest of the comments here so far to say you're NTA for not telling him in advance to have lowered expectations. It's a birthday. How many of them has he had already? He can be disappointed but no one over the age of maybe 21 should be having expectations for their birthday other than to be remembered by the people who love you. Again, you can love your birthday but the rest of the world is busy so if you want to have a big broohaha then plan it yourself. Or at least don't expect anyone to do that *every year.*", "Minor ESH.\n\nProbably should've been onto it before to temper expectations. Especially if he is a \"birthday person\" then you should've known you needed to pre warn him. But then he should definitely be able to read between the lines that things certainly change a bit once kids come along.", "NTA you just gave him the gift of carrying and birthing a child. I think that\u2019s enough for this year.", "ESH\n\nYou should've gotten a gift or a heads up about the much smaller scale birthday celebration. \n\nHe should have a more grateful attitude and realize changes come with a new baby.", "NTA but was this communicated to him ahead of time? If he\u2019s used to your making a big deal about his birthday and expected the basically the same effort as previous years, I could understand his reaction/feelings. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s an excuse for telling you that your ruined his birthday as that\u2019s a shitty thing to say but his feelings are valid if he thought it would be the same as the other years. He should definitely be more understanding that you\u2019re a mom now and have other more important priorities.", "ESH. You could have at least given him a small gift or a card, and he should have been grateful for you cooking a complex meal.", "A couple of questions- \n\n1. Did you get him a card? A gift? \n\n2. What does he do for your birthday?", "YTA because you didn\u2019t communicate with him about not being able to plan a party. If you know you\u2019re doing less and probably disappointing him it\u2019s fair to give him a little warning. Also immediately responding with \u201cdon\u2019t you see how upset I am\u201d when someone tells you that what you have done is upsetting to them is just manipulative.", "YTA. I'm sorry, but people here are too soft on you because of the baby. You're making up excuses for not clearly communicating with your partner in advance and put in little effort. It honestly doesn't take that much time and effort to put up some small decorations, buy a birthday card and order a small gift online. Show him you care.", "YTA\n\nCould you have asked a family member or other past party goers to help you this year?\n\nI think you should have at least given him the heads up that it would be more intimate and less impressive than other years rather than admitting to making no effort and then proceeding to get upset at his reaction\u2026 even if you couldn\u2019t plan a party, maybe you could have suggested he could go a friends house after your dinner with him. \n\nThe effort isn\u2019t just in the planning a party, it\u2019s making an effort in communication and letting someone enjoy their birthday even if you didn\u2019t make it happen.", "YTA.\n\nHaving a baby is exhausting and difficult. The life of new parents is stressful.\n\nBut if you want this relationship to work, you have to make time for each other. You have to put effort into maintaining your relationship. Even when you are tired and life is stressful.\n\nPunting on his birthday shows that you don't give shit. He has every right to feel that you put zero effort into his birthday because that's exactly what you did.\n\nThis entire post is based on a false dichotomy.\nThis birthday didn't have to look like his pre-parenthood birthdays, but there are a myriad of options that lie between his previous birthdays and putting in no effort to show that you care.\n\nIf he had put so little effort into your birthday, under these same circumstances, he would get buried here for doing so.\n\nThe fact that you tried to turn this around on him is wildly fucked up. \n\nYou put no effort into his birthday and then acted offended that he pointed it out? You are now acting like the aggrieved party? Somehow, showing no appreciation or care for your boyfriend hurt your feelings? \n\nSo now, he has to deal with how hurt you are by the time that you hurt his feelings? \n\nGet out of here with that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What you usually do for him, does he do the same for you?", "Yeah, this seems like key details someone should normally put. She didn't even write if she got him a present. \n\nDefinitely going to need more info", "This.\n\nNTA.  Absolutely understandable that you're not able to spend the time/money for a big bash this year.  I hope that you let him know that there would be no party in advance.", "He never asked for a party. He never complained about a lack of a party. These were just superfluous details used to obfuscate from the fact that she gave zero effort to show that she cared.\n\nReread the post. This was all about her exhaustion and stress, which made showing that she gave a shit impossible.\n\nBe real. \n\nWould you be cool if your baby daddy made dimner, like you both do any other night, and couldn't even be bothered to do anything else?\n\nOf course you wouldn't.\n\nHe never asked for a party. He just wanted her to give a shit.", "Excuse me. He asked her \u201cis this it\u201d. It sounds like he was wondering what else she had planned since he\u2019s used to more. Perhaps you need to reread the post.", "He was asking if this low effort birthday gift was it. She talked about how exhausted and stressed she was. This was absolutely true.\n\nShe was explaining why she was justified in putting little effort into his birthday. The pre-parenthood birthday parties she threw out are a canard to further deflect from her lack of effort\n\nNo gift. No card. No special note.\n\nJust dinner at home. Like always.", "I have a question - what does he do for your birthdays/anniversaries, etc?  I think we need to know what effort he puts into you before we can judge whether your effort was not equivalent.  Even so, I think you did quite a bit and made quite the effort.  I am going with NTA and that your BF sounds entitled and a bit spoiled.", "Did you tell him you weren't doing a party or just leave him to assume you were like you always do? Imagine thinking you're getting a party like usual, building up the hype, then nothing. That'd be disappointing. Also, what does he do for your birthday? That's important to note too. Without those extra details it's hard to give a definite answer so I gotta go with ESH", "apart from impregnating you what does he do for you his daughter the house seems like you are doing everything and he just shows up nta", "NAH\n\nYou aren\u2019t an AH for being tired and wanting to do something small. He isn\u2019t an AH for being disappointed it was small if he wasn\u2019t expecting it. It was a communication error on both your parts. You should\u2019ve asked if it was okay to do something smaller this year, and he should\u2019ve asked what you were planning and expressed what he wanted.", "He\u2019s an Asshole \nNo analysis required", "NTA at all. You\u2019re right to be upset at him, i\u2019d be mad happy if someone cooked me dinner on my bday. A dinner is better than nothing at all. Heck, i\u2019d be happy if my future gf/bf even REMEMBERED my birthday. I get that he might be used to big things for his birthday but he needs to realize he\u2019s not always gonna get that. To say that you *ruined* his birthday when things could\u2019ve been so much worse is just snobby imo lol.\n\n  But also, did you let him know beforehand that you weren\u2019t throwing him a party? Does he do the same for you on your birthday? That does factor into it tbh", "NTA. Lol what did you ruin?? You can\u2019t ruin a plan that was never made. What a little brat. I always say it\u2019s the ones who expect nothing but appreciate everything, who deserve the most.", "YTA - traditions and expectations are a big part of long term relationships. If you've created this expectation that you make a big deal of his birthday and you really didn't have the time or energy you should have reached out to a friend to help plan it. Or at the very least discussed it with him first so that he could make his own plans or temper his expectations for a smaller occasion.\n\nAn example from recently re. Traditions and expectations: every year my boyfriend has brought me flowers for our anniversary that are the same number as the number of years we've been together. He didn't do it this year and even though we had an amazing holiday away together it still made me sad. It didn't ruin the occasion overall but I did notice and was a little disappointed he hadn't done that tbh. However a perfect opportunity happened that meant I could do it for him instead to show him that it still mattered and I wanted to keep it going.\n\nEdit: this may also be me assuming your response, but if you use the excuse of having a baby to not have been able to go out for something like this, it's not valid. Ask a parent or babysitter to help out. Prioritising your partner after kids is so important and makes such a difference in keeping your marriage happy, healthy, and thriving. Commit to small things that are just for the two of you.", "Plus like, what should she have communicated. \u201cHey we have a baby now\u201d?? If you have two brain cells to rub together you can probably guess that a new mom back at work is not going to throw you a damn party.", "Sounds like you might be OPs BF \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude09", "It wasn\u2019t just dinner at home as usual, she got his favorite recipe from his mom and went to a specialty grocery store to get the ingredients for it."]}
