It's really not hard to just call someone the name and pronouns they say to use for them. She was actively and deliberately misgendering and misnaming op and she should be punished for that. \n\n'Didn't know it was that serious' my ASS.", "Also possible is the opposite - that the teacher is trying to be aggressively supportive to a student she assumes is a closeted male to female, without any care for what the student actually wants. I've known pushy people like that who pat themselves on the back for outing people.", "Exactly this", "Nah teacher just learned OP is actually cis and not her target of hate like \"oops heehee sorry about that!\"", "Bully kids? OP is 22.", ">\u201dI tried correcting her a few times and she brushes it off every time or just straight up says she not going to.\u201d\n\nHe did.", "Why?", "This. This is what happened. Fuck her and the horse she road in on.", "Yep. She only feels bad because OP is a man with a medical condition. If OP were trans, there would be no remorse.", "I was about to say the same thing. Tbh this sounds like a transphobe that thought she was \"redressing the balance\" by calling you something akin to your deadname and then reassigning your pronouns.\n\nShe completely changed her tune once she realised you were a cis man with a medical condition. This person should not be an educator.", "Yup.\n\nTotally what I thought when reading the post.", "you're a teacher and you didn't say their instead of 'his/her/their' ?", "TERFs that say stuff like they can always tell someone's agab are full of shit. I'm afab and for most of my childhood people assumed I was a boy because I had short hair and didn't dress girly\n\nTeacher is definitely the AH and is probably only acting nice now because during her meeting she found out OP is a cis man and now, in her mind, deserving of he/him pronouns", "Yeah. Honestly i hope the teacher gets fired, but i suspect there's not many people willing to teach at that place, can barely find teachers for regular highschools.", "Yeah, people who try to force an egg to hatch will find out the hard way they are assholes.", "That was my read as well.", "I read it as 12 my bad \ud83d\ude2d", "Fuck her WITH the horse she rode in on.", "THIS!\n\nA huge NTA!", "I'm sorry what? I literally wrote he/she/their. And yes, I'm a teacher. I don't need your approval to be one.", "Oh no definitely. I do have a slimmer of hope that at bare minimum they'll think twice before misgendering someone cause god forbid they misgendered another cis person lmao... or get mistaken as trans.", "My afab daughter hated \"tangle monsters\" when she was 3-4 years old, so she had a pixie haircut. People would think she was a boy even when she was wearing a tutu and a pink Dora the Explorer shirt.", "My best guy friend growing up was a foot shorter than me and had long hair. People would think he was my younger sister lmfao.", "Oh, Kyle looks like such a girl, they must *want* to be a girl, these are all things they are intentionally doing to *be* a girl, so I am going to respect their chosen pronouns and name that they have *explicitly told me are wrong* because only I can save this grown man from the closet.", "Lol, to be fair, there are teachers who treat kids the same.", "That doesn\u2019t seem fair to the horse.", "To be fair I think this still qualifies as a power imbalance cause teacher bullies student lmao. Would work in a uni setting. Bastard teacher.", "More fair than being fucked.", "It is, but imo it's less bad than bullying a kid.\nMostly cause kids are less mentally developed and usually more impacted. Though that *doesn't* mean OP shouldn't be upset, he should be and he's in the right for being uncomfortable. I'm just saying it's less likely to affect him long term.", "Oh yeah I'm not disagreeing with you! Just giving different \"the sentence might still work\" kinda vibe.\n\nI do fully agree with what you're saying there. The situation is truly upsetting. I am actually glad OP is an adult and can process this whole thing better.", "Yep! I knew you weren't disagreeing xD"]}
