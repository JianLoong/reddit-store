While tuna isn't everyone's favourite, it's not like cooking fish in a microwave, or sardines or something. \n\nA tuna sandwich isn't a POWERFUL smell, and most importantly it isn't a smell that lingers in the air, like perfume or something. I've literally ended up vomiting on airplanes from people using heavily scented hand creams or those sterilizing gels near me, because the fragrances linger in the air. A tuna sandwich might smell a bit fishy, but then it's gone. It's barely going to bother anyone. In fact, on more than one overseas flight of 10+ hours that I've been on, they offered tuna or egg salad sandwiches as \"help yourself\" snacks in the galley throughout the flight because they're considered fairly innocuous and widely-enjoyed by most people. Obviously I wasn't privy to all the hundreds of passengers on each Boeing 787, but as I wandered about to stretch my legs, I certainly didn't hear any comments or complaints, and most people seemed to happily reach for one or the other when they were offered.\n\nYou need to stop assuming that everyone experiences the world like you do.
