A tuna sandwich might smell a bit fishy, but then it's gone. It's barely going to bother anyone. In fact, on more than one overseas flight of 10+ hours that I've been on, they offered tuna or egg salad sandwiches as \"help yourself\" snacks in the galley throughout the flight because they're considered fairly innocuous and widely-enjoyed by most people.

Someone keeps trying to talk to you even though you have headphones on? Getting into your bubble?\n\nIt's not THEIR job to worry about strangers on a plane, so I hope you dont get upset at them.\n\nSo no, not your job to care, but common courtesy while you're stuck in the air with recycled air for multiple hours would be nice. People are so selfish nowadays, jfc. It just reminds me of when people said they didn't have to wear masks on flights because 'they don't do anything anyway'. Don't be that person. Think of others.", "As a frequent traveler, NTA, I would have done the same thing except I would have done it in front of her, handed her a $20 and tell her to purchase something more appropriate. \n\nFor some reason air travel makes people lose all sense.

But where you suck is by throwing it away. If she does end up taking it to the plane and people end up complaining? Let her deal with it. She's an adult.", "You are the hero we all need.  Thank you for doing a good deed for the people on her flight.\n\nNTA.", "Well, this is just weird...\ud83e\uddd0", "YTA", "YTA this was a weird thing to do to someone and highly inappropriate, you voiced your opinion and she disagreed, forcefully making the thing you think should happen because you couldn't accept her right to do what she wants in this instance was fucked up behaviour", "YTA. If she was able to get it past security (don't know how they would handle it since 1, I haven't flown in 20 years now, and 2, never tried taking food or drinks on a plane even BEFORE 11September2001), it wasn't your place to police what she ate where or when. Add to that, as far as I know, tuna is actually something airlines have served for meals, especially for lunch. And I hope you pay her back for whatever high markup thing she ended up having to buy to replace the food you decided to waste.\n\n\nETA. Something makes me believe that you're also someone who will throw coworker's food out because you don't approve of something about it", "YTA, and have absolutely no right to make that kind of decision for a grown woman, let alone your mother.

That was quite self-righteous of you. Awful behavior.", "YTA big time. Not only you wasted perfectly good food, but you also deprived your mother of the food she picked.

This is an annoying level of micromanagement.", "You threw away your moms food because if you were flying with her the smell would bother you but if your mom is hungry, that doesn\u2019t bother you. Nice reasoning. YTA.", "I hope she bought a tuna sandwich you little baby.", "YTA - It was your Mothers Sandwich.

Not more than any other kind of sandwich at least.", "They let you take food into planes now? The last time I went in one, the guy checking my bags threw my snacks away.", "Yes you are, what is wrong with you? Very rude, very sneaky", "NTA There is food she can buy on the plane if she gets hungry. And even if it was egg salad and not smelly, the mayonnaise could make her sick.

It doesn't matter what you think about it, if she's allowed to eat it on the plane, she can eat it on the plane. If it does become a problem, it's still not your place, but the staff's. Plenty of flights serve actual food, including fish dishes. But even in the hypothetical scenario that you had a point that she shouldn't eat the tuna sandwich in the plane (which you don't) you'd still be an AH for throwing it *in the trash*. It's perfectly good food, at least eat it yourself or give it to someone who would want it.", "You're right about an annoying odor for a few minutes but yta.

That would have been more acceptable imo. Unfortunately that is not how the story went.", "Poor passengers. Airline saving money at their expense.", "I am aware of your plans, but you won't be traveling on that aircraft. It is not your concern. Additionally, you wasted perfectly good meals.

You didn\u2019t save the people on the plane you just pissed off your mom and meter hungry. You clearly care more about other people than your own mother and that\u2019s saying something about you.

That being said, you are responsible for ensuring that you have your epinephrine injector while flying, as well as contacting the airline during seat booking 48 hours prior to flight time to notify them of your allergies to best allow staff to accommodate you. There is unfortunately no onus on an unknowing passenger to prepare food free of unusual allergens. All of that being said, I would understand this more if OP were worried about allergens.

The OP is right that it is rude to bring a tuna sandwich on a plane.", "Does your mind have an overarching narrative where you make sense. You threw out your mom's sandwich which is disrespectful and nasty and then justify that action by claiming you would throw up or a friend of yours will die from smelling tuna fish. These things are utterly nonsensical, which any same person would know, but even worse they are irrelevant. It is your mom who's taking on the sandwich, and it is your mom who is taking all the risk of that sandwich, and unless your mother has been committed to an insane asylum, this makes it absolutely none of your business.", "So I guess the flight attendants would need to make an accommodation, but this is not the kind of one of one off issue that impact this mom.", "Tl;dr, OP saved the passengers of the plane, and their mother (from the angry passengers).", "What are the limits of your power over the general population. is there a committee that helps decide what behaviors are acceptable?", "It\u2019s generally referred to as manners and common sense. Of which you have none, if you would eat a common allergen, one that\u2019s widely found disgusting, in an enclosed space, with multiple strangers, when there are endless other options.
