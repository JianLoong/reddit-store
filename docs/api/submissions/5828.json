You\u2019ve been far more patient than most would. \n\nAlso, idk how your husband feels about all of this, but if it were me I\u2019d feel so gross about this and probably refuse to be around those two.

You also should have shut it down immediately.", "I completely agree. They're definitely NTA. OP needs to get rid of them in their social circle and anyone that chose to side with them.", "This is so far beyond. It\u2019s a uper disrespectful, not at all funny. Block them, disinvite them from any party forever and cut them loose. Obviously they are no friend of yours and that kind of \u201cpick me\u201d attitude is very unflattering", ":( you may be right,  but I don't think I can cut out just those two. I'd lose the whole group.", "He thinks it's gross as a concept,  doesn't believe anyone is serious, and that it began as a joke at Selmas loneliness, and that at this stage it's more about annoying me.", "I don't know.  I'm still boiling inside. Atm I really don't want to speak to patty or selma ever again, but that would mean throwing away the friend group I've had since 19", "Wtf is this comment? Created a new problem? It's already done? She threw the trash out and she can be happy now.", "At first i didn't want to be controlling (like my mother is with my father but that's a _whole_ other conversation lol).. but Selma doesn't really come on to him anymore in any seriousness.  Its mostly Patty who still brings it up. \n\nHusband told me the various times that Selma brought it up. He always shut it down. Hard to describe,  but he more pitied her than anything. Told her to reverse the genders and how disgusting it would be, and she (Selma) got it.", "The game was 8 years ago. We were reasonably young, quite dumb. I was the only one in a long term relationship and never really toom part in earnest", "While that does suck, but since they sided with Patty and Selma... it is probably better to drop them as well.", "You absolutely have to. This is vile, disrespectful and homewrecking behavior. Those \"friends\" don't give a shit about you.", "Sounds like it's time for that friend group to go. Two of them constantly make jokes about sleeping with your husband, and the rest think YOU are being TA about it? The whole thing is beyond disgusting behavior. It's gross, not to mention sexual harassment. FRIENDS wouldn't spend their time winding you up and making shitty comments about your relationship.", "On the other hand if it was me... I text the whole lot of them & say \u201cit\u2019s not a joke when you find out that your friends don\u2019t care enough to listen. I asked for the nonsense to stop. But, clearly the joke is more important than my feelings or our friendship\u201d", "Maybe you should start by asking them why they think it\u2019s so funny to continue to imply that Selma wants to sleep with your husband. Does she? If you honestly think she would do that if she had the opportunity ... that\u2019s not a very funny joke nor is she a very good friend.\n\nIf they are just immature & like getting under your skin for whatever reason, this may not be a friendship that will fit in to your life anymore. The bet was stupid but it was funny when it happened. It\u2019s over & they haven\u2019t grown up enough to realize it\u2019s not really funny anymore. Perhaps, they believe your relationship is so solid with your husband that the joke could never be anything but funny because it\u2019s so unrealistic. Not sure but communication is really the only thing that can solve this if you want to resolve it.  \n\nCongrats on your marriage & welcoming a new family member. Wish you the best!", "The last sentence says it all.  Imagine your husband friend repeatedly makes passes at you.  Wouldn't you want him to stop bringing that friend around if you tell him repeatedly the friend does it.", "Winding people up and never being straight with each other is about as British as saying lift for Elevator:)", "I like this language. Going to use it. Thanks", "Thank you :)\n\nI know Patty keeps at it because they know it gets under my skin. \n\nI don't know if Selma wants him or the idea of him. A few times when we shared a flat she told him she heard us (thank you paper thin walls) and wished it had been her instead. He considered it both wildly inappropriate and sad. I'm not even sure if that counts as a come on though", "there.. is a difference between winding people up and sexual harrassment\n\ntry \"you've been sexually hqrrassing my gusband for years and I'm fucking done\" and then blocking them", "Oh yeah? Well, here in the US, repeatedly making \"jokes\" about banging somebody's spouse is a good way to get one's ass kicked. Rightfully so.", "So you are going to let your countrys stereotypes lead your life? Even if it makes you miserable?", "Why on earth do you keep associating with these people knowing how uncomfortable they make your husband? The fact that you haven't done something about this before now, seeing how wildly inappropriate AND disrespectful it is makes you the asshole, especially to your husband. \n\nYTA", "NTA\n\nA plot twist..

I feel like the joke should\u2019ve stopped being funny at the fact she refused the money cause she clearly wants to make good sleeping with her friends partner\u2026\u2026\n\nThe fact it was even continued after they were married is quite the bold move cause now you\u2019re basically telling this man\u2019s WIFE you want to sleep with him\u2026 \n\nAnd another friend egged it on?????? These women possess balls bigger than Mr Glouberman or Agent Clappers\u2026.", "NTA. I know your husband wasn\u2019t part of the original bet, but he could probably help shut it down permanently by letting them know that he knows about the bet, and he\u2019s definitely not interested.", "Firstly why are you even friends with these idiots acting like mean girls.\n\nThe joke wasn't funny when it was first said and isn't funny years later.\n\nI say good riddance", "Nta. You need to stop hanging out with both Selma and Patty. They are both toxic. Selma is being weirdly obsessive with your husband and Patty is just being awful.", "NTA sometimes being a bit lonely but having less shitty people in your life is a good payoff.\n\nAnd if you really think about it do you really want to keep a relationship with these people when they've literally just been trying to make your husband have sex with her; like that's what's going on here right??", "If you really lose the group about this is because you overgrown them and it was time to look for new friends.  Maybe is time tonadress the friendship in a more one on one approach and not as \" the group\".", "And please update after you do!", "sorry but there is a line even for us brits. the minute someone says enough you've taken it too far you stop. just because you are a brit does not mean you have to accept your husband being sexually harassed. \n\nyou did not agree to the bet. your friend went out of her way to help the other win. your friend wants tour husband and they are doing everything in their power to mean girl the situation to their advantage. \n\nthey are not friends after 19 years they should have respect for your view but dont. that is not friendship", "NTA. Those Bouvier sisters are always causing trouble.", "NTA, if she wants to play games she\u2019s going to win stupid, your husband needs to point out publicly that he\u2019d never be that desperate.

So definitely nta.", "NTA. May I suggest getting better friends?

I ended a friendship with someone that lasted for like 20+ years. She was the one I trusted the most in the world until she gave me enough reasons to not trust her anymore. I don't regret it one bit.\n\nThey are giving you enough reasons to come to the conclusion that they have no space in your life anymore.\n\n- sexual harassment towards your husband (!)\n- treating him like a sex toy that has no say in all this\n- disrespecting your relationship and you\n- ignoring your well set boundaries\n- masking their bullshit as \"joke\" to get away with disgusting behavior. More than once. Even after you make it clear that this is complete and utter BS. \n\nAnd quite frankly it is disturbing to think how long she might have had fantasies about sleeping with your husband, using this \"bet\" as a way to fulfill her fantasies. Does she even care about how you would feel? What is the end goal with that?\n\nYou and your husband deserve better than that. And I can't wrap my head around why your family and friends aren't appalled to that kind of behavior but to try to put the blame on you.\n\nSry for my mistakes but English is not my first language and this got me quite mad..", "Welcome to your 30s. I managed to keep my high school friends for a really long time but sometimes you just start to see things you can\u2019t overlook anymore.\n\nI\u2019m nearly 50 and have been thinking almost daily about cutting someone loose that I\u2019ve known since we were 12.\n\nIt\u2019s not awesome but my current friends are more aligned with my values.", "19 is really young. I'm still friends with a couple of people I was friends with at that time but my closest friendship group I made in my mid twenties and another one in my thirties. We grow up and move apart and it's ok to let friends go. I still value and cherish the times I had with many of my friends but our time was done and we all moved on. \n\nDon't fall for the sunk cost fallacy and think you're losing something because you've invested all this time and energy up until now. You don't lose what you already had but you could be signing up for a lot more of what you currently have - which is two friends who you don't enjoy spending time with. You don't have to ghost them and never speak to them again, but maybe limit yourself to doing stuff with them that you know you'll enjoy, avoid the situations that bring out the worst aspects of the friendship and just see how it goes - it might sink or it might swim. \n\nI have a good friend and our relationship was very rocky a few years back and I decided to let the friendship go gently. I only did \"activities\" with her, so no just sitting around having lunch or a drink, specific things like see a film, walk an alpaca, and so on (I didn't tell her this). It actually saved our friendship. We were able to spend positive time together and we're back on pretty good form."]}
