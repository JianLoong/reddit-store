One consideration I have is that her dad will be helping us move that day. The anniversary dinner is the very next day. \n\nI have a good relationship with parents and rest of her family. Do I risk spoiling things if I choose to sit this one out? WIBTA?\n\nedit: We've talked it over. The $150 would just be for my plate, not contributing to their parents meal at all. Just covering myself. We came to an agreement where I pay her $50.

I don\u2019t think so. If I were the parents I\u2019d never allow it. I\u2019ve never even bought myself a $150 dinner and I\u2019m 55 years old. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019d be the AH, but your partner may not agree.

Insane\u2026", ">Do I risk spoiling things if I choose to sit this one out?\n\nWell, if you were just \"dating\" after 10 months I'd say skipping wouldn't be too bad. \n\nBut it sounds like you and girlfriend are moving in together...? If so, you're now like a partner and not doing the dinner probably is going to come across as not great. \n\nI'll go NAH.", "NTA for being financially responsible. If your invited somewhere then it should be assumed it comes at no cost to you in most situations", "NTA.  Her not telling you sooner is a real AH move.  However due to you moving in together the day before the dinner I think you are stuck paying.  I don't get making the BF pay for the partner's parents anniversary dinner.  That seems out of line to me.", "NTA that's a very weird position to put potential guests in, if they want to have a private chef experience then they should either pay for everyone or prepare for people to send their best wishes but be unable to attend.", "NTA. That\u2019s a ridiculous amount of money and I wouldn\u2019t want to go purely because of that. Good luck, hopefully you\u2019ll update us all how it goes later on..", "From their point of view, I can see them thinking it\u2019s strange or some wrong of you to not attend. But that\u2019s only if they have no context. \n\nNTA - Would you be comfortable informing them of the financial situation? That it\u2019s not feasible to pay $150 per person for dinner? As much as you\u2019d love to attend you only just found out. It\u2019s a heck of a lot. They might be understanding. But it would look bad if you didn\u2019t show.", "NTA. I\u2019ve never invited anyone to come to a party I was hosting and asked them to pay a penny. People shouldn\u2019t host events if they can\u2019t afford them. Your girlfriend put you in a bad position. I can\u2019t say if not going will hurt your relationship with her parents, but I would certainly understand if someone had to bow out of an engagement because they couldn\u2019t afford it.", "YWNBTA. You were invited. Etiquette says the host pays. This is bait and switch. This isn't a family dinner; it's a fundraiser.\r  \n\r  \nYou have no obligation to buy a place, and you're totally entitled to cancel. Completely understandable that you don't want to pay $150 for a dinner.\r  \n\r  \nEven if you were a millionaire, you wouldn't be an AH for canceling. This is something that needs to be made crystal clear when the \"invitation\" is given.", "NTA.  Your gf needed to inform you of this expense beforehand, not days before.", "Who is hosting this party? The parents or their children? I don\u2019t know of any way you drop this on a guest last minute and it be okay.\n\nIt would be fine for you to sit this out, if you are asked by her father on moving day be honest and tell him that you weren\u2019t aware of the cost ahead of time and you don\u2019t have the money.", "NTA. You just can't invite someone to a celebratory dinner and then add later that it will cost 150 dollar to attend.\n\nThe compromise that you reached is more than reasonable. But are you expected to come up with a gift as well? In that case, the compromise sucks too.", "NTA. If they really like you and want you to be there maybe they would consider splitting the bill with you or covering you since they know you are trying to manage your expenses.  They can't be mad if you aren't able to come because you aren't able to pay for their private chef that they chose.", "NTA.", "NTA. If you can\u2019t afford it, you can\u2019t afford it. They definitely should have told you about the cost when it was first brought up.", "Nta.\n\nIts strange to me that they are hosting a party celebrating them, with what they want to do, and you say they are well off too, and yet guests have to pay 150? I am assuming they also expect gifts? That's a lot of money to celebrate someone else. I get if thats an amount YOU decide to spend on someone, but to expect it of another is a bit too much.\n\nIf this is their normal, this may also just be the beginning. You need to figure how to handle this not only for the sake of this time but for the future parties and get togethers.", "$150?! This is unreasonable - even for a wedding, the hosts (aka the couple getting married) don't get to dictate to guests how much $$ to gift them. Obviously there is a certain amount you can *hope* each guest might gift (which would be enough to cover their plate), but different guests have different budgets and that can't be the expectation. The only thing that can be expected is that not everybody can afford to cover their plate, which shouldn't matter because the reason for inviting someone isn't for their money.\n\nIt is the parents party that they're choosing to throw, yet expecting the guests to pay for? I would decline if this party was going to strain my financial situation; it's disrespectful to expect people to pay this.\n\nIf you are in the position to afford it, and given the moving situation (is the father saving you $150-300 by helping with the move?) then I would consider going. But if you can't afford it, then definitely NTA. Nobody should ever enforce financial obligations onto someone else.", "I'm glad you got it worked out, but what kind of hosts plan a party to celebrate themselves where their guests are expected to pay to attend?  Maybe this is a cultural difference but where I'm from in the US - I've never heard of such a thing.  You invite ppl to attend celebrations in your life that you'd like to celebrate with.  I've invited my daughter's boyfriends to attend celebrations that were for my family members but I would never have expected them to contribute.  If we were going out for one of my daughter's bdays they were invited.  If they also wanted to do something special, we would've made sure ours was on a different day, would not expect to be invited to their celebration and we would not expect them to contribute to ours.  But if we couldn't afford to invite ppl to this celebration, we would just keep it to immediate family or even to the specific child.  \n\nMy husband and I have been married for 31 years - never have we expected anyone to celebrate our anniversary with us.  I know that may be atypical but we had the means to celebrate in the way we wanted.  My in-laws didn't have a lot of disposable income so my husband and I primarily subsidized (a large amount for us at that point in our lives, along with what his brothers could afford reasonably)  a short cruise for one of their significant anniversaries.  \n\nIf these people live comfortably and are asking ppl to pay that kind of money to attend an event celebrating themselves, that just seems really off to me.  Maybe they don't actually live that comfortably and their finances are a house of cards but they have to keep up appearances?  There's no scenario in my mind, when I could ask a guest to pay for their own meal.  I do regularly go out to dinner with friends and we split the bill.  But if I asked if they wanted to have dinner, I certainly wouldn't choose a restaurant that would be $150 per person!   I mean, I may have had one meal in my life that was equivalent to that price.  \n\nI don't mean to be alarmist, but if you're in the US and someone is asking this of you AND then willing to negotiate!  - I mean these are red flags, imho.  \n\nI will backtrack - if the kids are hosting this, then they are just idiots.  You don't invite people to a celebration and then say everyone has to pay their own way - unless they are your peers - same age and socioeconomic status.  (I.e. Thursday is my bday - anyone want to hit up x for margaritas?)  Do something for the couple specifically - whatever they can afford collectively. \n\nAgain, I'm glad you guys figured it out, but if you're in the US, I think you're a saint of a bf having any part in this.", "ESH. If she's inviting you to this event for her family, that $150 should be coming out of her pocket, as you're her guest. You could have hacked it more maturely.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
