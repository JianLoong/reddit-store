I was more than happy to host her, prepared activities for them and everything went great. This morning, my daughter and Jane insisted on making breakfast, which was fine. I allowed them to make toast while I made eggs and smoothies for them.\n\nThey must have messed with the settings on the toaster, and the bread came out a little burnt. Jane said something along the lines of ew what happened and before I could react, she picked it up and put it in the trash. I was appalled and shocked. For context I didn\u2019t grow up with much so tossing food in the trash is not something I\u2019ve done or seen.\n\nAlthough I understand she\u2019s a child, I explained to her that this isn\u2019t okay, people work hard to afford food etc. and of course my daughter was very embarrassed which is understandable from her perspective. What is crazy is Jane\u2019s moms reaction who informed me that my behavior was unacceptable and I had no right to call out her child and it was probably traumatic for her. She took no accountability for Jane's actions.\n\nNow three people are upset and I'm here thinking AITA?\n\nEdit: It\u2019s not as much about the loss of the slice of toast as the nonchalance with which it was just tossed away that was surprising. Just to clarify.\n\nEdit 2: I was shocked, as in it took me by surprise. It was unexpected. I didn\u2019t yell at her, I just explained that throwing food away isn\u2019t okay, and why that is. She seemed to take it pretty well, but must have informed her mom as well.

NTA, but it's not that big a deal, unless you're literally living under the poverty line don't worry about a piece of burnt toast.", "Lots of people who can\u2019t read here", "NTA, you did nothing wrong by explaining her that food should not be just causally thrown away  if it is not to someone's high standards (I mean it depends how burned it was, if it was a little bit , then the reaction is ok, if it was all black, then obviously it would have to thrown as nobody would eat it but I assume that was not the case and you wouldn't intend to make her eat a completely burned bread).\nIt is good to teach kids gratefulness, her mother seem crazy...if you only explained to her daughter, there is no problem. It is good that her daughter sees other people perspectives on life,  it looks like she must be only pampered, if her mother thinks she will have trauma from a little telling off:\u2060-\u2060D", "NTA, food waste is ingrained in US culture to the point it is considered normal, but in most of the rest of the world this is not normal, where l come from no-one would think of throwing away a slightly burnt slice of bread. My daughter is six and she has known better for years now. You did a good thing by explaining to the child why this is not acceptable behaviour", "First if all, half the commenters don't appear to have read the post, because OP did not call Jane's mum.\n\nSecondly, I would also not be ok with a child just tossing food like that. Not at all.\n\nWhat makes OP TA is the overkill she used. \nSomeone else commented that OP really only needed to retrieve the toast, brush it off and say 'Oops, we don't toss food here,' or words to that effect. \n\nJane's mum obviously has different values she's teaching her kid so it's just about maintaining your house rules, not worrying about Jane's attitude to food.", "I agree OP probably made a big fuss because of the wording here but as a teacher\u2026yeah no kids definitely go running to their parents over every little thing. \n\nI had a student one year that told her mom I was always making \u201cmad faces\u201d and she didn\u2019t want to be in my class. I was squinting to read words because my glasses had broken and I was waiting for new ones.", "Also, OP seems to be blaming an eight year old for being blas\u00e9 about food waste, when she\u2019s probably only copying behaviour she\u2019s seen at home.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of suppressed anger directed at a small child here; OP definitely needs therapy.", "I agree with this take. OP, next time just offer to make the toast yourself. This kid and her mom should get over this, it really isn\u2019t that big of a deal unless there\u2019s some important detail we\u2019re missing.\n\nWhen you\u2019re 8 and at a friend\u2019s house, sometimes their parents have to appropriately discipline/teach you a house rule you\u2019re unfamiliar with. Just because your parents aren\u2019t there doesn\u2019t make you immune to this stuff, that would be a recipe for disaster. Sounds like daughter\u2019s friend got embarrassed (it happens) and took it way harder than OP meant for it to come off. I think the best damage control at this point is for OP to apologize, explain to the mom that she didn\u2019t mean to upset her child, and that going forward she\u2019ll approach things more delicately. She shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for the principal though, because I agree that wasting food isn\u2019t a habit I\u2019d want to watch a child form.", "Thank you! This is my take too and I'm really surprised by all the YTA responses. OP clearly didn't think the toast was burned enough to merit being thrown away, whereas Jane did, as that's probably what happens in her household. The OP (from what I can tell) gently told her that throwing away food that could reasonably have been eaten (in this case presumably by the OP or her daughter) is  wasteful. (Also, the issue for OP doesn't seem to be about food insecurity or expense, but about the principle of food waste, so I don't know why so many people are talking about the insignificance of the cost of a slice of toast - if a person cares about avoiding/minimising food waste, they're going to be upset over perfectly good food being thrown out regardless of how much it cost).\n\nAs long as OP didn't overstep her bounds and raise her voice at or intimidate Jane, nobody really did anything wrong. I think Jane's mum is kind of an AH for phoning OP to tell her off (unless OP went overboard in how she dealt with the kid, in which case OP is the AH and the mum is not).", "Op didn't contact Jane s Mom ,it was the other way around. According to edits NTA\n\n\n Also burnt is usually just a bit too much done around the edges not completely black as coal  so very much still comestible.", ">For future, maybe set expectations for other children visiting your home? \"If you don't want something, let me know before you throw it away, because we might be able to ...put it in the compost, use it in a different meal, someone else might want it\" etc.\n\nI absolutely love this idea for the OP! Setting expectations right off the bat and also explaining the reasoning behind not wanting food to be thrown away too readily.", "I read that OP was going to have the burnt piece themselves instead of making the kids eat it.", "Not to be rude, but depending on her environment, this might be either a bit of exaggeration or legit. Maybe she\u2019s used to composting. Maybe she\u2019s used to food rubbish going into one bin and getting sent out to animals. Maybe she\u2019s used to kids leaving food for the parents to handle and so she\u2019s not really seen kids toss their own food. \n\nWe don\u2019t really know a lot about where she\u2019s from or why she was so taken aback.", "You are siding with the mom who said their 8 year old was traumatized by someone explaining a cultural concept of not wasting food as rule in a separate household. It was unfortunate the rule was broken before it was explained, but it doesn\u2019t sound like OP was rude about explaining it. If Jane\u2019s mother wants her daughter to be able to waste food at other people\u2019s houses, Jane should not be invited back. This is a case of Jane\u2019s mother not respecting OP\u2019s ability to explain household rules to her daughter and overreacting.", "I'm surprised a the Y T A comments. Perhaps its a cultural thing, but I was brought up to respect the rules when visiting someones home, and to expect consequences when you don't.", "Op was probably planning on eating the toast like most parents do when their kids accidentally burn toast.", "Well said.", "Apparently you\u2019re supposed to eat the food you don\u2019t like or go door to door in your neighborhood until you find people willing to eat it.", "It's wasteful.", "They said \"a little burnt\" though. I don't know how inedible a bit of over browned toast is. It depends how burnt it was. What if it just wasn't to her liking but was still edible? A simple scrape would have been an easy fix. I'm not saying OP's reaction was okay but this also doesn't mean they have an unhealthy relationship with food.", "Honestly, this was my first understanding of the post too. It was the only way the anger made sense because who is getting angry over a slice of bread? Half this thread apparently \ud83d\ude02", "Who is sending their kid to the weird bread lady\u2019s house after this?", "You act like ppl don't write shitty misleading titles all the time here...", "Well it may have been a culture shock kind of thing.\n\n She might come from the kind of house where she's scolded if anything dropped or burnt isn't immediately tossed, and hasn't been exposed or didn't know this opposite attitude existed\n\nWhat's weird is op was shocked and she's not 8, presumably she knows people teach different things in homes.", "The OP was annoyed the mother didn't scold Jane though for burning and throwing the toast away. So it does sound to me like op sees this as a huge deal. Unfortunately, we weren't there so we can't judge how she told Jane off, it might have been too much or it might have been fine.", "yeah, there is a point you can't scrape of the burn taste it has got all the way through, so I ditch it.", "Why would you punish a kid over burnt toast? What would make you assume this kid has no discipline. I am a mom of 3 kids- if you burn a piece of toast, you throw it away and get another one- there is no need to make someone uncomfortable about it especially if they were a guest in your house.", "If someone is food insecure to the level that a piece of bread thrown out is going to seriously put a wrench in their ability to have enough food to eat, they are not having sleepovers with additional moths to feed at their home.", "Was the steak burnt in this scenario too?

Something very similar happened to me when I was about 16 and a friends mother got annoyed that I hadn\u2019t saved the egg whites while separating eggs. Those were far more viable than burnt toast but I still think she is a petty, daft woman who pinches pennies despite having plenty! I\u2019ve never been back to that house. \nYTA Op!

But if a kid that hardly knows me were to make that sound on their plate, I would probably flinch like normal and then turn it into a joke. Because they\u2019re just kids!

The charcoal from burnt toast has benefits too, for example it stops diarrhea", "Nope. Once it's trashed, it's gone. Good point on scraping burnt pieces off, but nobody knows how burnt it was. Everything you said is fine besides the fact that it was already put in the trash, that's unsanitary food practices regardless of if you re-cook or how you remedy it. Garbage cans can have insane amounts of germs, and those varying germs have varying living conditions."]}
