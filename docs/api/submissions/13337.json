I was more than happy to host her, prepared activities for them and everything went great. This morning, my daughter and Jane insisted on making breakfast, which was fine. I allowed them to make toast while I made eggs and smoothies for them.\n\nThey must have messed with the settings on the toaster, and the bread came out a little burnt. Jane said something along the lines of ew what happened and before I could react, she picked it up and put it in the trash. I was appalled and shocked. For context I didn\u2019t grow up with much so tossing food in the trash is not something I\u2019ve done or seen.\n\nAlthough I understand she\u2019s a child, I explained to her that this isn\u2019t okay, people work hard to afford food etc. and of course my daughter was very embarrassed which is understandable from her perspective. What is crazy is Jane\u2019s moms reaction who informed me that my behavior was unacceptable and I had no right to call out her child and it was probably traumatic for her. She took no accountability for Jane's actions.\n\nNow three people are upset and I'm here thinking AITA?\n\nEdit: It\u2019s not as much about the loss of the slice of toast as the nonchalance with which it was just tossed away that was surprising. Just to clarify.\n\nEdit 2: I was shocked, as in it took me by surprise. It was unexpected. I didn\u2019t yell at her, I just explained that throwing food away isn\u2019t okay, and why that is. She seemed to take it pretty well, but must have informed her mom as well.

I can't really tell now, on second read. Maybe they talked when the kid was dropped off.", "If you\u2019re gonna throw out food just because it\u2019s been sitting on the floor for any period of time at all I stg I will go make an 8 year old cry rn /s", "I get the feeling OP reaction was much more over the top then he\u2019s leading on", "This is my point\u2026 when she said \u2018appalled and shocked\u2019 her daughter was embarrassed, the other parent pissed. Sounds to me that the reaction for a slice of bread in the trash is disproportionate. Would I personally eat a burned slice of bread? No. Unless I m starving and in the house is the only thing left. Did they did it on purpose? Doesn\u2019t even sounds that.", "honestly seems like a symptom of some serious control issues", "Because kids get hungry.  They need food. \n\nWhat are they supposed to do? Have a sleepover and tell the friend,  sorry,  we don't have enough food for you? \n\nIf you can't provide for a guest, don't invite them over.", "It doesn't sound like it was that burnt.", "I\u2019ll reflect on that.", "Calling it \"traumatic\" for the child was over the top. Every adult here overreacted.", "LMAO!!!!", "oh definitely. I mean it's already bad given this thread but I am sure she was extra.", "In OP\u2019s opinion. Again, not her job to put her values on another person\u2019s child.", "It's not *putting your fucking values in*.\n\nIts *his damn food and based on his claim, the child wasted it over it being a bit too toasty.*\n\nPeople can go too far with this--my wife's grandparents grew up in poverty and hate it when you don't clean your plate. \n\nBut again this OP sounds like he was completely reasonable in how he handled it and why. And if you don't like that--don't send your child to someone else's house to get fed.", "Yikes. If you are going to try to parent my child & over-rule my values, you better tell me that before we agree to a sleep over, because you bet I\u2019m not sending my child to your house in that case.", "\"Try to parent my child\"\n\nThis isn't even scolding. This is \"the kid threw away perfectly edible food, so I educated them that this wasn't needed\".\n\nYes, when you send your child to eat food at someone else's place, and they disrespect their household and their food, they're gonna get  lesson likely.\n\nNow one piece of bread is a tiny problem and OP handled it in kind. Wasn't a plate full of food. It was a piece of slightly over-toasted bread.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot to mention, food doesn't go in the trash, it should get composted. Another \"value\" that I assume you don't believe should be educated to other's kids?"]}
