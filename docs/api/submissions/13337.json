I was more than happy to host her, prepared activities for them and everything went great. This morning, my daughter and Jane insisted on making breakfast, which was fine. I allowed them to make toast while I made eggs and smoothies for them.\n\nThey must have messed with the settings on the toaster, and the bread came out a little burnt. Jane said something along the lines of ew what happened and before I could react, she picked it up and put it in the trash. I was appalled and shocked. For context I didn\u2019t grow up with much so tossing food in the trash is not something I\u2019ve done or seen.\n\nAlthough I understand she\u2019s a child, I explained to her that this isn\u2019t okay, people work hard to afford food etc. and of course my daughter was very embarrassed which is understandable from her perspective. What is crazy is Jane\u2019s moms reaction who informed me that my behavior was unacceptable and I had no right to call out her child and it was probably traumatic for her. She took no accountability for Jane's actions.\n\nNow three people are upset and I'm here thinking AITA?\n\nEdit: It\u2019s not as much about the loss of the slice of toast as the nonchalance with which it was just tossed away that was surprising. Just to clarify.\n\nEdit 2: I was shocked, as in it took me by surprise. It was unexpected. I didn\u2019t yell at her, I just explained that throwing food away isn\u2019t okay, and why that is. She seemed to take it pretty well, but must have informed her mom as well.

I grew up not tossing away food because my parents are pretty eco-conscious (if I recycled wrong or didn\u2019t compost right I had to take it out and put it in the correct bin - we did our own compost). \n\nAnd so I was absolutely stunned at my friends house how if you didn\u2019t finish your food it went in the trash. If something didn\u2019t turn out - into the trash. At my house, a guest\u2019s leftovers would go in the garbage but ours would go in the fridge and we\u2019d eat it later. So she knew at our house if toast was burnt or cooking/baking didn\u2019t turn out right she didn\u2019t have to eat it, but we wouldn\u2019t toss it.

I was so surprised when I started school and I saw other children throwing food in the trash.  I think it was because my mother had read me Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Girl Who Trod on a Loaf\" when I was very little.  (My mother was very kind and patient about everything except wastefulness.  I could catch snakes and accidentally release them indoors and she would just have a calm conversation with me about how I shouldn't do that, but I think she would have been very angry if I threw out a slice of bread.)", "YTA OP, yeah I'm an Adult and I don't eat burnt toast.
