I feel for your sister but they\u2019re her and her partner\u2019s kids and their responsibility. They need to find a way to deal with it without constantly troubling others. It\u2019s nice of you to help here and there but it would be way too much for you to help her all the time, you have your own life and they\u2019re not your kids.", "NTA she's expecting you to spend the night away from your husband very short notice, when your job and studies aren't close to her.\n\nYour request for a decent amount of notice was completely reasonable, and even doing less would not make you an AH.\n\nYour sister just demonstrates poor planning/'It'll be fine' mentality, not just in this but in having 2 kids under 2 with a husband that works away.", "NTA. The fact that you have dropped everything in the past to go help her is great,, as is your willingness to help with some planning.  Yes, she is in a tough situation and I do not envy what she is going through, but she cannot expect people to travel to help her out.  Has she spoken to a doctor about the screaming?", "NTA - has your sister taken her son to the doctor to find out why he is screaming so much?  That doesn't sound normal.", "Definitely NTA. You're so nice for giving the help you already have but but your sister and her partner need to make a better plan for their family. This could also include relying on you with advance notice like you said", "NTA, it is not your child and it is not your problem, she should take her child to the doctor or see if she can hire like a nanny (i have no clue about the financials here)\u2026 i mean, u have school and work as well! She cant expect from u to turn your whole live upside down for this..", "NTA. I get why she's desperate, but she's not entitled to any of your time. This seems to be a case where professional help is needed, and you are not responsible for that.", "NTA she needs to discuss this with her kids\u2019 doctor.  The screamer could have something wrong such as a food allergy, etc.", "NTA\n\nIs she going to go to work for you?  Is she going to go to school for you?  Will she be studying for you?  Will she be going homework for you?  No you say? \n\nLook, you help when you can.  THE VERY LEAST she needs to do is give you dates well in advance.  If that's too much of an inconvenience for her, well too bad.  Maybe she should have thought about all that before having two children under two.", "NTA! I had similar situations like your sister with my children, it's very tough. And I appreciate your efforts to help so far. But first of you are responsible for your own well-being (health, work, school etc). So if you don't have the capacity, she should respect that.", "NTA\n\nNot your kids, not your responsibility. You definitely should help when you can and want, but she is no way entitled to your help.", "NTA - Babies sometimes have crying phases and there are cry babies. It's terrribly exhausting for mothers and I feel for your sister. All doctors advise you to get help if you are overwhelmed. That's what she did. But there is help other than supporting at night. You can bring food over, help with the laundry, tidy up or take the children for a walk during the day - during which she can sleep. And above all, the father has to help and come now. Why can't he take a holiday during this difficult time? Can the father's family help?\nAnd sometimes it also helps to have an open ear.\nBut you don't have to break yourself in the process! You have to be strong and healthy yourself so that you can help others.\n\nEdit for typo", "It's a hard one but NTA her husband needs to step up or his family. Alternatively, she can move closer to you and your Mom.", "NTA. Sister needs to talk with her husband about possibly changing jobs so he can be there to support her and their family. It\u2019s not fair to put it all on you or your mom.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re doing all you can OP, I know it massively sucks for her but you have your own life too. Can her in laws help at all?", "NTA. If she wants help, you did not flat out deny her that, you just set terms which are reasonable. What good is it if both of you are stressed out and drained? If she needs help, but can't plan a week in advance to get it, then she doesn't NEED it, she just wants it the same way it has been given before. Conveniently.", "NTA... but when your sister snaps and hurts those kids and kills herself remember her cry for help.", "NTA, and it\u2019s funny that yesterday a post blew up when a mom described how hard it was to get her toddler and baby to sleep, so she minimized distractions. Here\u2019s your sister about to have a breakdown because she can\u2019t get any sleep.  Your help probably has kept her somewhat sane until now, and I can\u2019t believe how much you must love her to put yourself through that.\n\nBut neither you nor your mom can do more than what you\u2019re doing. You may be able to only do a lot less.  \n\nI\u2019m a little suspicious at the dad having to work so far and so many nights from home.  Only because this commonly seems to \u201cjust happen\u201d when screaming babies make their inevitable appearance.\n\nJust as inevitably, many husbands (not all) will immediately become virtuous workaholics \u201cbecause I have to support the family.\u201d  They have to work all the time now, and definitely have to travel, so darn it, they just can\u2019t be home to do their share of childcare with a child they created.\n\nMaybe your sister just needs to tell hubby that since he can\u2019t be home to help, their main residence has to be near her family, so IF you can help, it\u2019s not such an ordeal.  Although, I would NOT blame you if that suggestion just gave you severe anxiety.\n\nAny time someone says that it\u2019s easy to just \u201cloaf around\u201d taking care of a baby, I remind them that playing the never-ending cries of a baby is a commonly used TORTURE device. \n\nHubby needs to step up more. Your sister seems to know he won\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m just sorry:(", "NTA. Can't they pay for child care? Maybe the family could contribute towards that?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Anymore than you're able to and it can become a situation where it just impacts multiple areas of your life. \n\nIt's great to be able help and look after family, but you need to look after you too. It's not being selfish or an A H. \n\nI have no kids, but have heard clingy babies will just cry until they're held. But in this case it sounds extreme. Is screaming really just a phase or is there something going on? Might be worth a check up, just in case. You never know, after all.", "NTA \n\nYou got your own life and responsibilities.

Don't know what's possible for them, but I live far from my close family so I paid for the help you'd normally ask family for when my kids were small, and we had the best babysitter! If your sister can afford it, this is really a great option, especially because it's transactional, so no favours involved.", "NAH\n\nYour sister is in a difficult position and you and your mom have lives that don't revolve around your sister and her kids.  One doesn't trump the other.\n\nHer husband needs to possibly take some time off work to help with the kids.\n\nWhich kid is screaming?  Is it the older one, or the younger one.  Screaming for hours on end is not normal.  Your sister needs to have someone look at the screaming child.  Start with a paediatrician.  There can be several reasons for this.\n\nAnother option is you and your mom put some money in to get a sleep specialist in for a few nights.  This may help your sister find a routine that works for them.  Maybe just one or two nights may be enough.  Works best when it's done in the home with familiar surroundings for the kids.\n\nYour BIL may need to look at his work.  Can he work closer to home in his occupation?  If so, is he able to transfer to a role that has him home every night?  This can be temporary.\n\nPerhaps the person your sister is actually angry at is her husband who isn't there and is taking it out on you and your mom.\n\nIt is a difficult time but there is only do much that others can do.  Your sister is exhausted and just doesn't know what to do.  Another thing that's worth considering is taking one of the kids to your place (or your mom's) for a sleepover (maybe the older one).  That way your sister only has one kid to consider.\n\nDo they go to day care?  That may not help at night but it may give your sister a chance to catch up on some rest during the day while she navigates the screaming child at night time.", "Nta. She decided to have children with a man who won't be home much. Not you.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. As painful as this sounds, your sister needs to realize that she can't depend on everyone forever. Your mom is 60 and still working as a nurse. You work and go to school. She can't expect people to drop what they're doing to help her out constantly. Her son needs a specialist and is her husband aware of her needing help?", "NAH. It's a preexisting big burden for you to take on, but it sounds like your sister is at breaking point so she's not TA for asking. \n\nHer husband needs to find a way to be home while they get through this stage and they need to figure out if there is something causing the screaming.", "I\u2019m confused by all the n t a. I feel for the sister, and while OP is absolutely not an AH, I don\u2019t think the sister is, either.\n\n 2 under 2 and screaming for hours, with hubby out of town for work, sounds like a hellscape. \n\nNAH it\u2019s just a really sucky situation.", "NTA. That\u2019s what she signed up for when she had kids", "Mine had colic, and seemed to scream constantly until we figured it out.  But each kid is different.  Sometimes you\u2019re just too exhausted to go to the doctor.\n\nNotice how the husband just takes for granted that the sister and mom will take care of his responsibilities even though they both have jobs?\n\nEven if you\u2019re struggling financially, you can\u2019t just leave all the chilcare to your partner and just hope they don\u2019t go insane from no sleep.", "Hopefully partner is compensated well for being away for days at a time.\n\nIf not, why is he doing it?", "The father HAS to come home and help. No point in working more hours if mom is too exhausted to take care of children and then some accident happens to her or one of them.\n\nIf this was a pilot or truck driver, they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to \u201cdrive\u201d if they hadn\u2019t rested. Oh, but that\u2019s an expensive truck or plane.  This is just a human life.", ">I\u2019m confused by all the n t a.\n\nWe are also confused by your N A H\n\nCos Op is doing her best already and couldn't this one time because you know, their own life, mental health, marriage and all that", "It's a really sucky situation entirely of the sister's making. She seriously thought having 2 children under 2 was going to be easy? I understand things happen sometimes but sounds like really poor planning to me.", "I\u2019m not honestly sure what you\u2019re getting at.

It also doesn\u2019t make OP the AH for saying no. \n\nIf the sis was all \u2018you\u2019re an AH for not helping me\u2019, then she would be an AH. But she\u2019s disappointed. She\u2019s allowed to feel whatever sort of way about it as long as she doesn\u2019t lash out because of it.", "Sometimes shit just happens. And even if it\u2019s poor planning, I empathize with a parent who has a baby crying nonstop for hours. Not to mention her hormones are probably still out of whack with how close her pregnancies were. This sounds like a fucking nightmare. \n\n\u2018IT wAs hEr cHoIcE\u2019 doesn\u2019t change that. Sis is in the shit and isn\u2019t thinking clearly. OP isn\u2019t obligated to move her life to change that, either. \n\nSo it\u2019s just a hard time for sis rn."]}
