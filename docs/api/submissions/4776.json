Why can't he take a holiday during this difficult time? Can the father's family help?\nAnd sometimes it also helps to have an open ear.\nBut you don't have to break yourself in the process!

If she wants help, you did not flat out deny her that, you just set terms which are reasonable. What good is it if both of you are stressed out and drained? If she needs help, but can't plan a week in advance to get it, then she doesn't NEED it, she just wants it the same way it has been given before.

Your help probably has kept her somewhat sane until now, and I can\u2019t believe how much you must love her to put yourself through that.\n\nBut neither you nor your mom can do more than what you\u2019re doing. You may be able to only do a lot less.  \n\nI\u2019m a little suspicious at the dad having to work so far and so many nights from home.

Although, I would NOT blame you if that suggestion just gave you severe anxiety.\n\nAny time someone says that it\u2019s easy to just \u201cloaf around\u201d taking care of a baby, I remind them that playing the never-ending cries of a baby is a commonly used TORTURE device. \n\nHubby needs to step up more.

They don\u2019t pay well enough for a nanny a lot of the time though, just better than the other options in their location.", "I understand that, and of course she should not drop everything and do whatever her sister says.\n\nYou see to me there is text and subtext.\n\nTo me the text is: I didnt do what my sister asked me to do AITA? - of course not.\n\nBut (again to me) the subtext is: My sister is physically and mentally overwhelmed, she is sleep deprived and exhausted. She is struggling to take care for her 2 young children. She had a breakdown and BEGGED me for help and I said no, AITA - yes\n\n\"she had a breakdown\" \"she begged\"\nTo me these are heavy word, and based on OP description of events it is posible that the sister is on a verge of a mental health crisis. Is OP being dramatic with this wording - mabey, but again I am only jugding from the text/subtext.\n\nShould OP do excecly what the sister is asking, no of course not. But if it is true the sister is in mental health crisis and asking for help - then OP needs to react, either by cheaking on the sister mental wellbeing, or find someone who can help her, or offer to help her find medical support that might help the sister.\n\nMental health crisis is very serious so is PPD, it is important to be alert for other people mental struggels. When a person who is in a mental health crisis begs for help there needs to be an immediate reaction - and anyone who fails to react on mental health crisis is AH, sorry just my opinion.", "Then the husband should pay for daycare or nanny for the kids.", "NAH. It's understandable to not want to continuously help, and it's understandable for your sister to really need help. She's probably really desperate. I've been where she is and it's awful. \n\nMy partner lost a job after the 2008 crash and just to have something had to take a job where he had to travel a lot, and at the time we had a toddler and a baby. I can still clearly remember being sick with a high fever and not being able to get anyone to come help me and being afraid that I wouldn't be able to even get the baby out of the crib because I was so sick. That's been 11 years and I definitely still have trauma from it. \n\nEveryone tells parents that they should ask for help when they're struggling, but the moment they do it's \"you shouldn't have had kids if you didn't want to deal with this\". Parents, and especially moms cannot fucking win, no matter what they do. \n\nYou don't owe it to her to come over, but she's not an AH for asking for help either.", "NTA.", "NTA, but is there a way you and mom can coordinate your help for a night? Maybe she drives to you guys, one of you takes the kids for the night the other takes the mom. Disrupts your lives less, less commute for you, and actually gives her a night to sleep instead of still being in the house with them.\n\nYou're already being incredibly helpful though!! I'm glad she has family like you. Would it be possible to talk to the husband and involve him in brainstorming solutions? Even if he can't fix his hours, surely there's something that can be done.\n\nEven if it's as drastic as downsizing and moving closer to her support system for a few years, it's better than her misery and exhaustion escalating to either damaging their relationship or putting the kids in danger.", "NTA but maybe you could help her find a solution. I\u2019m sure she is really struggling and could use support. Hiring someone to come in once or twice a week would likely help her a lot. She may be too stressed right now to even think logically about those resources though. I only have one kid but that sleep deprivation really makes you lose sight of what\u2019s logical and reasonable.", "You're NTA, her husband is tho \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Kid's are their parents responsibility, planned or not your sister and her husband decided to have two children with just one year between them.

This is an issue for her and her husband to work out.", "NTA. She's lucky to even have one family member around to help. She need a reality check to take what you can and DEAL WITH IT when you're a parent.", "NAH\n\nYour mom has work. You have school and work. Your BIL has work. Your sister is overwhelmed. You all want to help your sister, but are at a loss as to how. \n\nStart with a plan. It's not too late. For instance, if you have say, Tuesdays as light days, give her a Tuesday date for two weeks from now. Let her know that on that date, you'll schedule to be at her house overnight. That way, she's not harried for that day and night, and you both know that you'll be there. Have your mom do this, also. Your sister will see some light at the end of each week's tunnel and you all have a set schedule, This may help to reduce the panic calls, so maybe all of you will be a bit less overwhelmed. This, in turn, may help the little sleepless one - who's probably picking up on the stress and anxiety going around. \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA\n\nLook, your sister has a partner. He and she *chose* to have two kids.\n\nIt is THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND DUTY to do what they need in *their* lives to care for those kids.\n\nFamily aren't a guaranteed resource anymore. That was how Boomers raised their kids, but for adults having kids now? Unless your family has wealth, family gotta work to live. Your mom is busy. You are busy.\n\nYour sister *chose to have kids*.\n\nIt's her responsibility to arrange for childcare if she needs a break, and she can *hire* people for that.

For 'days' at a time. \n\nI don't know what your life is like that you think most households can afford a sahp and childcare, but that's not the financial situation of anyone I know.", "It may not be the ideal financial situation but the situation right now could become dangerous quickly. If she is truly sleep deprived, that is not safe. They may have to find a temporary option until they can get something more long term figured it out.

Thankfully my now ex was around and realized it and took over for awhile.", "NTA \n\nI feel for your sister but you don\u2019t owe her babysitting!\n\nAre there resources around?

Lol", "NTA. You're married.\n\nThe single version of me would just move in with my sister and live there if she needed me.

You can't uproot your life. Your mother definitely can't.\n\nI would just tell her, I can be over every Friday night to help out and put order to it. Take it or leave it. You would be devastated if in her exhausted state something happened to the kids. It's not your fault. It's not her fault.

She can hire someone to help.", "is it possible for your sister to get a babysitter on some days and have the babysitter take the kids out of the house for a few hours so that she can get some sleep? I\u2019m assuming part of the reason she\u2019s kind of at her wits end is that she is not getting enough sleep at night, so maybe if she could get a few hours during the day she wouldn\u2019t be as upset.

It\u2019s hard planning as a parent - so many things to arrange. So she\u2019s trying and only calling when she\u2019s beyond done.
