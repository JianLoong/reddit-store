I am living in CA, my brother in MI. My niece is staying with me for October, November & December while her dad sorts things out. \n\nThis morning she started her period. In her words I'm \"pro earth hippie\". I just don't see the reason to waste things when the reusable option has always existed. \n\nThrough her previous period she used products she'd bought, but I and my daughters use cloth.\n\nShe asked me if I'd grab her some pads and I told her they were under the sink. I honestly didn't think at first as its so normal for us. She came back and asked if I was joking. I chided her for being rude, told her that was what's available. I told her we had unused ones that she is free to claim. She was still a little upset, so I grabbed her a pack that she requested.\n\nI explained that I don't budget for pads and I don't really like the disposable ones. I don't mind if she doesn't want to wash them, I will, but if she wants disposable ones she has to pay for them & be responsible for taking them out of the house.\n\nShe got upset and called her dad who was unhappy; he told me I was singaling her out, she is struggling and needs me to support and not attack her. I agree, but I'm housing her for free. I am already paying extra. Pads are expensive.\n\nI have given in for now and gotten her some more, but explained that next month she will use cloth or buy her own because I will not be able to afford it in December. \n\nShe is still upset, had a bit of an emotional explosion, was sent to her room. Her dad is angry & hates that I made her so upset (and she can't be comforted being so far away). \n\nI do feel bad. AITA? I feel like this isn't too serious, but I remember being a teenager, md everything was serious at that point.", "created_utc": 1699911231, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ullbm/aita_for_telling_my_brother_niece_that_she_either/", "score": 649, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Teens don\u2019t have a ton of money, and right now it seems you\u2019re responsible for looking after her. Stop forcing her to use your hippie products.

Everything is different for her. In situations like this, kids crave the familiar. Now is not the time to be pushing new things on her like reusable pads. Get her what\u2019s comfortable for her. Stop making this such a big deal for her, and don\u2019t let her see anymore of the resentment you have for her temporarily staying in your home.\n\nAlso, one or two packs of pads should cover her entire stay, no? How tight is your budget that they can\u2019t be factored in? /gen\nIf the pads really can\u2019t be factored in because it would cut into grocery/gas/bills money, then talk to her dad about sending over $20 for her pads.\n\nEDIT: Also \u2014 I would feel very strange using pads that someone else has used.

EVEN IF the issue truly is financial and not just an 'eco-friendly' thing, the fact that you, in your own words, \"chided her for being rude, told her that was what's available\" makes YTA. You could have easily explained, calmly and compassionately, that unfortunately you can't afford pads at the moment, and that you're sorry if she's uncomfortable with it. Resuable cloth pads aren't the norm, and it's unreasonable of you to expect someone to accept them without any complaint. This is someone who's going through a period of instability, and it doesn't sound like she's old enough to be working, so that means it's not her fault. The mentality of \"she should be grateful and accept what she gets\" does not apply to children.

Your niece likely has some bigger things to be concerned about if she\u2019s having to live with you whilst her dad softs stuff out so it\u2019s probably not worth causing a rift or issue over.", "Ask your brother for the money and buy her disposable pads.

She was not comfortable with your way, I personally wouldn't and would view it an unsanitary to have flat out biohazards laying around. It's like saying \"hey, I know you've only ever used sanitary napkins but I don't so I'm forcing you to use this extreamly uncomfortable menstrel cup that's new and looks scary\", you wouldn't force that, would you? I'm assuming you've agreed to look after your niece for free(or why else wouldn't you ask for money off the bat), if you do that, that includes looking after her and supporting her during her cycle. Why did you agree to these terms if you where not comfortable with them? Why did you set expectations you wouldn't meet? \n\nIf you don't want to pay for your niece, that's perfectly fine, ask her father and mother for payment since you are taking care of her.

Please don't make this harder than it has to be for her. I'd never expect a child to use cloth pads.", "YTA I really hope you don\u2019t traumatize your niece from this experience. I hope you got that she\u2019s going to trust you atm, she probably feels mortified.", "YTA and you\u2019re humiliating a young adolescent girl. You sure can budget 5 bucks for some pads. Get over yourself and stop pushing your hippy ways onto a young girl. You\u2019re martyring her for asking for a basic right. Shame on you.", "Really? If She didn\u2019t choose to be separated from her home and parents, it sounds like it was against everybody\u2019s wishes. Disposable pads are like $4 at Walmart, and periods make teens self conscious already. Don\u2019t make it harder on her.\n\nYTA.", "Pads are expensive? Omg! It's already November, so you have her one more month! All you needed to buy was two packs! Hell, one can last a few months. You can't afford a five dollar pack of pads? Sounds like you got bigger problems. YTFA!", "I honestly think YTA for not trying a bit harder to help a kid out, but dad can just send his daughter $20 for a couple packs or send them over through Amazon or some other service, no?", "YTA.  Of all the hills to die on, you picked the absolute pettiest.  I'd almost be impressed if you weren't doing this to a defenseless teenage girl.", "YTA over *personal* fucking hygiene. Youre either caring for this child and providing what she needs, or you are not.  Make a decision.\n\nFucks sake.", "YTA anything that touches your genitals is a huge deal. Buy her the damn pads and let her throw them away in the trash like a normal person.", "YTA. Good god. Get over yourself.", "YTA \n\nWhy can't her father send you the money to buy her feminine products?  Pads are not really a luxury item.  Buy her pads.", "YTA. Periods are very personal and teenagers especially can be self conscious about leaking. You use what you know works for you. I\u2019d be a little grossed out using someone else\u2019s reusable pads. How old is she? Does she even have means to pay for her own pads? You shouldn\u2019t have agreed to take her in if you weren\u2019t prepared to help with basic necessities.", "YTA. The best period products to use are the ones that work for the person using them. Provide her the pads that are most comfortable for her. It is not your place to impose your own ideals on her body.", "YTA for a couple of reasons. \n1 - you've handled this on the assumption that everyone sees the world as you do, and has had the same learning and experiences. Many people don't understand reusable period products. I'd only ever heard bad things about them e.g. unhygienic - until my daughter started her periods. I wanted her to have an easier go of it than I ever did so I did a deep dive and researched it all. Since then we've both only ever used reusable. \nSo perhaps instead of judging your niece, you could try helping her to make an educated choice. Don't lecture her, and you'll need to begin with an apology for how you initially handled things. If, after this, she doesn't want to use reusables then that's her prerogative. You mustn't shame her because that will cause damage and potentially stop her ever reconsidering reusables. \n2- she's a young girl away from home and everything she knows. She will be feeling very sensitive right now. And especially at that age, periods are rough. You've been outright nasty to her. I get it, it's a financial burden for you. But instead of laying that on a child who didn't choose this situation - perhaps you could have asked her Dad first? \n\nPlease take some time to re-evaluate how you handled this and make amends.", "YTA, buy the girl some store brand tampons and pads and drop the subject.", "A big box of pads is like $20.  If you cant afford that, how can you afford to take care of multiple children?  YTA.", "Im a man and even I know that you don\u2019t tell women/girls what period products they can use, and I know if you are responsible for a girl you\u2019re responsible for getting her the period products of HER choice.

YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HER!\n\nIF ITS ABOUT MONEY... GO TO A WOMENS SHELTER AND GET HER SOME FOR FREE.\n\nWhat a weird hill to die on. You sound like fun.", "YTA, you're getting stressed by a 10 dollar box of pads? Be for real. If you truly are that poor, tell your brother to pay for it because this is not what was meant by the sharing economy. \n\nDo you all share underwear as well?", "And the aunt of the year award goes to...not you. As a woman, you should know periods are the most uncomfortable time of the month and we want to make ourselves as comfortable as possible, including what products we're using. She's comfortable using pads. Idk what type of pads you buy that are so expensive and yes I understand inflation...but is it really going to hurt your budget that bad? She's only there for 3 months, which half of that has already passed.\nI'm assuming she doesn't have a job since she's only in the state temporarily. Sure her dad could have given her a little cash to get by with certain things, but I'm not sure of his financial situation, and either way it shouldn't be that big of a deal. I'm sure she's never going to want to visit you again if she can't even be comfortable during that time of the month and you probably made her feel like a burden just for not using the same menstrual products that you and your family do. I wouldn't say you're an AH but you could have a little more consideration, especially since it seems her family is going through things.", "YTA. Pads aren\u2019t even that expensive. You\u2019re just being a straight up asshole. You shouldn\u2019t shame other women for doing what they need for their bodies. Some women have too heavy a flow to just use cloth. Like be for real.", "YTA. Your excuse is that pads are expensive, is 5$ per month really going to ruin you?", "YTA!! the occasional box of pads isn\u2019t going to break the bank.\n\nI don\u2019t have a uterus, but I keep a variety pack of tampons at my place for guests. It's just polite\n\nEDIT I don't know enough about menstrual products to have an opinion on the health concerns of various products. I erased that part cuz the rest stands", "Ha yes, let the young teen put things that make her uncomfortable in her underwears. Then be surprised she is upset. This is a very weird hill to die on, pads aren't even that expensive. YTA.", "Yta, you're an adult who has voluntarily taken on the responsibility of this minor. What each person uses for their period is a personal choice. If he dad can't provide, then you need to.  It's great that you think you're superior to anyone who uses it, but this is not the hill to die on.", "YTA. Most teenage girls are self conscious enough about their periods. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s really about the money. You just don\u2019t want to buy them. She will remember this for the rest of her life.", "YTA.  I\u2019m sorry that approximately $8 is going to break the budget, but are you serious?", "Big YTA she is in a new situation not of her choice, dealing with a new way of living, during a difficult time of the month and you are gonna die on the hill that she endure her period the same way you do. What are you god? Let the girl have one thing in her life be the same.", "YTA  see how you like it when she says that she is going to free bleed. Very hippie and environmentally friendly!", "YTA. Are you so strapped for cash you can\u2019t buy your niece a couple packages of pads? You can get them most times on sale, like $20 would buy her 2 decent sized bags to get her through the next couple of months. Her whole life has been turned upside down and you think now is the best time to make changes? She needs things to be as normal as possible and I would feel really weird using someone else\u2019s pads.", "YTA How would you react to someone trying to dictate how you or your children handle your period hygiene? \n\nYour niece is with you for support and it sounds like pushing the eco-friendly agenda is more important than actually caring for her.", "Dude, YTA. You agreed to house her for 3 months which includes supplying her products for her needs. The inconvenience that it causes you to buy products for 3 months is nothing compared to the inconvenience it causes your niece to use products that she is not comfortable using. Unless this was discussed prior to her stay, then you are responsible for providing her with period products of her choosing. It\u2019s seriously not worth upsetting her and giving her a reason to feel upset with you. Not to mention, cloths are not really hygienic feeling for most people. No shame to those who choose to use them, but some people find them to be reallyyyyyy gross and you shouldn\u2019t expect a child to just be okay with that because of your \u201cpro hippie earth\u201d lifestyle.", "YTA.  If you don\u2019t want to spend the money ask her dad to buy them for her but no reason to shame her for wanting to use standard products she has always used and are the typical products most people use.", "How expensive are pads in America for goodness sake? Can get pads here cheap as 70p (just over a dollar). How is that impacting your budget? Not everyone wants to cloth and clearly your niece doesn't wish to do so but yet you're alienating her for her choice to use basic human necessity?\n\nYTA. Give her a break, stop being tight and support your niece.", "YTA: every woman has her own preference for period care items. She\u2019s already uprooted from her life and going through a rough time. Don\u2019t make it worse. Just buy her the products she likes. A reusable pad sounds so gross to me, and I\u2019m an adult with decades of period experience behind me. She\u2019s just a kid, she\u2019ll likely find them more awkward and embarrassing.", "Can\u2019t ye go to dollar tree for pads?", "YTA- you can go to dollar tree and get her supplies.", "YTA - Buy the kid some period panties.  Or, buy what she is used to.  She already has enough going on without you adding to it.", "YTA. I buy a name brand, relatively expensive tampon brand and spend about $9-10/month. Generic brands, especially when there's a sale, are about half that. You really don't have $5-10 to spend on her sanitary products each month? Highly, highly doubt it.", "YTA. Your job while your niece is staying with you is to _**take care of her**_. This means providing her with _**everything**_ she needs. So you don't like disposable pads, that's fine. Your niece, on the other hand, has just been uprooted from everyone and everything that is familiar to her, and your response is to tell her to suck it up for yet one more thing that's unfamiliar?", "YTA, yeesh. Using cloth is your decision, but she's not your kid and you're expecting her to *share pads* with you and your daughters?! If you can't afford a box of disposable pads once a month, why did you agree to house her knowing children come with expenses? Also, how old is she? Does she have a job/income to even buy pads? Did you ask your brother to send a stipend for her necessities? Tbh it sounds like you only took her in to make yourself look good and have decided it's your way or the highway, kindness be damned. She's already had her life upended and now you're making a fuss over pads, ffs. Get over yourself, you sound insufferable.", "First of all, how old is she? Second of all, is this really that big of a deal? In case she feels more comfortable using disposable pads she should not feel ashamed for doing so. While I understand menstrual products tend to be very expensive, she has to have the right to feel comfortable at least.\n\nOverall, I would also say a soft YTA as her father should help both you and her out financially, however, buying two packs of pads for her should also not be considered too much in this situation.", "YTA. You don't budget for pads? It's less than $10 for a box that should last a couple of months. Stop making stupid excuses about budget and buy this poor girl some f#$%ing pads. She's going through enough without you piling on your stupid hippy guilt trip.", "YTA- every woman should use what they are comfortable with. Her dad can venmo you but you are ridiculous.", "yta", "If this is how you ran your house you should have discussed this up front with your brother and requested the funding from him beforehand. It is absolutely disgusting to make her use reusable pads! I personally would never. Then again, I use a period cup and some people would never use that. Asking her to make such a huge change is unreasonable. Her father expecting you to pay for her medical supply needs is also unreasonable. Still unsure why menstruation products are not considered medical necessities... But it is what it is.", "yta\n\nbuy her some pads\n\nforcing what you use is not right and as a women you should understand\n\nasking her to use reusable pads you or your daughter have used is not right\n\nyou sent her to her room seriously", "YTA- You agreed to care for your niece therefore you should adjust your budget to care for her and make her as comfortable as possible in this tough time. If you can\u2019t do that, then why did you agree to care for her? \n\nAs a teenager I was so embarrassed when it came to periods it took me about 4 periods to tell my mum. I also only liked to use pads cause that\u2019s what I was familiar with. One of my Aunties didn\u2019t like this and thought I should use tampons. I was like 14. She pulled me aside one family gathering and gave me a massive talk about tampons and how to use them and how it\u2019s a better method. It made me want to crawl in a hole and die. Im now 25 and am still in shock my Auntie had the audacity. \nI now use reusable options but if someone was staying with me I would go and buy whatever they wanted and some + snacks to make sure they feel safe and comfortable in my home. Periods are such a vulnerable time, just let the poor girl be.", "YTA- Ask her dad to buy them but there is no reason to shame a teenager for asking for a totally normal and standard product. Yes, you are housing them and that includes helping with basic needs. At that age I would have been freaked out too. And people with heavy in predictable periods probably need more that a piece of cloth.", "YTA and her dad potentially is too. He should be sending her and you money to support her. \n\nThe way you run your household and life is not normal for her, and she's a teenager who isn't living with either parent (trauma trigger maybe?) which can be uncomfortable. Her asking if you're serious isn't even that rude.", "YTA and I use cloth pads because I want to. But I've chosen mine with care and they work for me. I wouldn't share or use a brand someone else picked out. They're also rather expensive. When I used disposable pads there were some I liked and some I didn't. The few times I visited by dad and got caught without them he didn't blink at my specific brand requests for them.\n\nI still keep disposable pads in my house for when my sisters visit and get the good ones for them.\n\nFor a visiting teen-ager going through upheaval fighting over what they want to put in their underwear (as long as it's hygienic) is absolutely not an appropriate fight.\nEven with your own teen, it's not an ok fight.\nLet them choose and either fund it or quietly get a parent to fund it.", "Is your niece still in school? Since she has her period, I'm going to assume middle or high school since she is staying with you. So you want her to wear a diaper to school where she will be reluctant to change it. Then if it doesn't leak and she doesn't get an infection, she will subject her classmates to the odor of stale blood. Not to mention that she probably doesn't know how to use cloth pads. \n\nBasically you want her to be an outcast in her new school. YTA", "Ask her dad for the money. He should be helping financially while she is there", "YTA- how cruel and unsupportive can you be of a young woman already dealing with the horrible realty of being a woman? And also gross you really expect her to be fine using your reused cloth. Come on. You can budget the extra $8-$10 a month to help a young woman be comfortable with her period. This is ridiculous. Women are supposed to help women, especially young vulnerable women", "ESH but the poor girl who\u2019s displaced from her home that you just embarrassed.

So are you going to buy her her own fabric pads then?  What exactly does 'unused' mean as to the ones 'under the sink'?  What sort of fabric ones are we talking about here?", "YTA\n\nGross.", "YTA \n\nJust get your niece some pads. \n\nShe's staying with you while ' her dad sorts things out ' ...

Pads are not that expensive.", "YTA - you can\u2019t dictate what someone uses on their period, everyone is entitled to use what their most comfortable with. On top of this she\u2019s a kid going through a lot already. \n\nBut also please look into period underwear! I don\u2019t know if this is a thing in America, but they are quite popular in Aus and they kind of just feel like slightly thicker underwear but they\u2019re reusable, more comfortable than pads and don\u2019t seem as gross as reusable pads because you already wash your underwear.", "Yta - don\u2019t push your lifestyle/choices on a child that is going through a lot.

Geez.", "YTA. She\u2019s basically a child, and dealing with periods is hard to get used to. If you can\u2019t afford to buy her disposables, discretely ask her dad for money.

And I have HEAVY periods due to endometriosis.\n\nJust checked the Walmart website and saw the cheapest pack of pads for 3.58 USD for 22 pieces. That is more than enough for a period.\n\nYeah, her dad should fund this, not the teen girl. But if I was in your position, I would happily buy my teen niece some period products to make her feel comfortable. Periods suck, especially when you're a teen and still figuring it all out... \n\nI honestly think this is a weird hill to die on, OP, and YTA.", "NTA.  I used reusable pads and a menstrual cup.  Its not a big deal.  Everyone used reusuable until the first part of the 20th C.  Many of my friends\u2019 mothers did, as did my grandmother. They are more comfortable and leak less, which are the main reasons I used them. \n\nIf the girl\u2019s father wants her to have disposable pads, he can provide the money.", "NAH \n\nShe is a teenager, and I get why she is upset. Periods can be a hard and emotional thing to deal with as a teenager. I myself have heavy periods and the pads were overflowing when I still used them as my primary method of dealing with periods.

I hope I don't sound elitist or anything but... say you buy 2 boxes, one regular and one overnight,  a box of 20-30 is 8-9 bucks at my local target (for a brand name)?  so we're talking 20 bucks.

Though I disagree that the onus falls to aunt automatically.  \n\nDad and aunt need to communicate better in general and should use this to learn about any other needs that dad assumed would be met and if aunt is able to provide those or if something else needs to be worked out.\n\nAgree that it\u2019s awful in general for the kiddo.

Nothing wrong with that, but that\u2019s why I don\u2019t feel aunt was treating niece like a burden. When I got my period I would walk to the store and buy my own pads. At 12. Even if she doesn\u2019t want to go buy them herself, I completely believe a girl that is period age is within her abilities to call her dad and tell him she needs money for pads. The aunt didn\u2019t tell her she couldn\u2019t wear them, nor did she not provide an alternative, she just said she couldn\u2019t afford them. Dad is such an asshole for getting a call from his daughter about that and not thinking hey, let me send some money for aunt to help out.", "Nope. There's an absorbant layer, and a waterproof backing.\n\nI've literally never had leaks with reuseables. They're way comfier and more absorbant than disposables."]}
