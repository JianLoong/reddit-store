We came from different ethnic groups. I'm 100% Javanese and he is 100% not Javanese. He likes to make fun about my ethnicity on a daily basis, but it usually is just a light joke of how strict my culture is and how the Javanese often came from a poor family background. I usually just laugh it off.\n\nYesterday, we were talking about random stuff, but my boyfriend somehow managed to bring up my ethnicity to joke about it. It started by him saying that he doesn't want his future children to learn about Javanese culture or have Javanese names. I was confused because I'm 100% Javanese and I want my future children to understand their roots, so I asked him why. He said the Javanese are basically just a bunch of slaves back in the old times, so the culture is contaminated by it. I stayed quiet and he continued. He then explained that my ancestors are slaves and we inherited the slave mentality. I was so shocked and I straight up asked him if he thinks my parents are slaves. He said no, but my grandparents are, so my family and I inherited the mentality straight from them. He continued his speech by saying that the Javanese are suffering because of their own culture.\n\nTBH, I often tell him about the struggles of having strict parents that expect me to stick to our culture, the traditional way, all the time. I was complaining about it but I'm definitely not suffering from it.\n\nI was so mad at him and I told him that he just insulted not only my roots, but also my family and my culture. He got mad and he defended himself by saying that he was not insulting anyone because everything he said is just fact and it is actually in the book that he read during college. He also said he got a lot of Javanese friends who are okay with his statement. I told him that I will be telling my family what he said since it's \"fact\" and see how they will react. He said I'm overreacting and being an asshole about it. He continued by telling me what the Javanese are saying about his culture. I WAS FURIOUS. I never even once said anything bad about his culture or where he came from. He said that it's not me that said it, it's the Javanese out there. And I told him he should've just fought \"the Javanese out there\" instead of putting his anger on me, who did nothing or said anything wrong to his people.\n\nHe won't apologize because he genuinely thinks that I'm overreacting and oppressing him for telling facts. He also said I would understand the facts IF ONLY I can educate myself by reading the book that he read.\n\nHe's been giving me silent treatment ever since. I'm still so mad and I don't want to apologize for snapping at him even though he said I'm the one who's overreacting.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1684513420, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13m0bfq/aita_for_snapping_at_my_boyfriend_because_he_said/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
