You can tell her you have your own relationship with god but you need **her** advice.  Telling anyone, who is pushing religion on you, to stop, will get you nowhere.  Religion is thicker than blood.  You might just have to nod politely and let her say her schpeal.", "Religion and politics are the 2 things that you will never be able to change someone's mind about. All I can suggest is that every time she brings it up, tell her you love her, and you will hang up now. At some point, she will may connect the religious push to not talking to her. Also tell her outright that shes being rude to you. \n\nGood luck", "NTA. She probably means well, but she needs to do a better job listening to you and less lecturing/proselytizing.", "Sometimes when people are very religious, it's quite annoying. It's like someone who discovered a magic pillow and feels good when they hug it. Some hug the cushion from time to time and that's perfect but others always have it in their arms, talk constantly about their cushion and try to convince you that you would be so much better with the magic cushion too and rub it on you on it as soon as they get a chance.\r  \nYou have every right to be annoyed by the magic pillow, especially if the magic pillows don't mean much to you.\r  \nSometimes there's nothing you can do about this kind of obsession other than deal with it.\r  \nMaybe by telling her nicely, she'll try to be careful. Or join the church of the spagetti monster and talk to him about it constantly too ;)", "NTA\n\nBut at the same time, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s not going to give you support exactly the way you want it so you are going to need to go to someone else for comfort in the way you need it.", "NTA.\n\nThat first line of \"that's the devil speaking to you\" is your dimwit Grandma using God as an excuse to dismiss your problems.\n\nAlso, if you wanted to be petty, you could tell her \"Hey Grandma, I don't think Jesus would approve of you being so forceful - remember, you're supposed to be a Fisher of Men.\"", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole at all. In fact I think that it is awesome you set a boundary and expressed your needs. You needed someone to listen and even if god is the way she can comfort- you can tell her that\u2019s not comforting to you. You can respect her faith and still have your own viewpoints.", "NTA, but you need to stop going to her for comfort. You *know* she makes it worse, stop putting yourself in that position", "NTA But bit of advice? You can't change her, especially if she's old and on the god train.

If you don't want comfort in the form of religion, stop going to a deeply religious woman for help and advice. If you guys were just having a regular conversation and she was inserting Christianity in and pressuring you to convert then she would absolutely be wrong but it doesn't seem like that is what is happening here. If you lived in Rome would you go ask the Pope to patch up your worries and then get pissed when he says Find God too? For context, I am also an atheist. I don't want religious advice either, so even when it comes to therapy I only use doctors who don't believe in any deity.", "NAH.
