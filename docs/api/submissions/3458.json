Myles Berkowitz directs and stars as himself, a man who decides to combine \"the two biggest failures in my life--professional and personal\" by setting out on a filmed quest to have 20 dates and come out with both a movie career and a love interest.\"  \n\nSpoiler alert - he succeeds on his quest!\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20\\_Dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_Dates)", "I find this really sad, because to me it indicates he can\u2019t interpret her smiling and laughing as anything other than sexual interest. Like maybe HE would never bother treating anyone like that unless he was sexually interested.", "yeah that makes no logical sense at all. \u201cShe smiled and laughed when I said I\u2019d buy her dinner\" IN THE MOMENT. The lack of interest is evident in her lack of response to subsequent communications. Your friend doesn't sound too bright...", "It goes in one ear and out the other.  He will act like he\u2019s listening, but he never changes anything.  I\u2019ve always said if you\u2019re unhappy about something, but don\u2019t do anything to change it, you have no business complaining.  He won\u2019t change, so he can stay alone.  Those girls are not there to find a relationship, they are there to make money.  He thinks he will eventually find one that will want him to rescue him.  He only likes tiny petite girls, and he thinks the only way he will find one that looks good enough for him is at a place like that.  P.S. he looks like a gorilla.  He has his good point, he will give the shirt off his back to help his family, and my husband (he\u2019s the only friend he has), but he has ways that make me want to wring his neck.", "fr", "Hate to shit on my friend but he\u2019s also hit on clearly teenage waitresses and servers before. Like do teenage girls find it flattering when a guy in their mid twenties hit on them? I have a feeling the guys think y\u2019all must love it.", "or he could just read a book or watch a blog that gives a woman's take on dating and suggested dos and don'ts... the guy really sounds completely clueless...", "I am in a tough situation. There\u2019s no way I can go about this without him seeing it as an attack.", "That sounds like a great idea for a normal self aware person. But sadly my friend is very defensive and will probably see that as an insult.", "I mentioned in another comment that any sort of kindness he will interpret as romantic interested.", "No he just doesn\u2019t understand situations. He hasn\u2019t socialized much for the better half of the last decade.", "That\u2019s kinda like how my friend is. He asks for advice but when you say he\u2019s doing something wrong he gets defensive.", "It sounds like his problems go way deeper than just relations with the opposite sex.", "NTA. Dont think this needs more elaborating tbh", "NTA. If I was that girl, I\u2019d make a point to never be in his proximity again. Not the place or time, dude.", "The conversational cheat codes that some guys are pretty sure will unlock the Sex Achievement if you do them right. \"Flirting\" as it's done when you have no particular understanding of or interest in your interlocutor (or, more to the point in this context, your *target*) as a person.", "Nope, not flattering, guaranteed they're all bunched up together talking shit about \"The Creeper at table 5.\"", "Mostly its weird and uncomfortable. There is a select subset of girls who are all for it but the majority of those aren't in great mental spaces. I'm just gonna give you some advice he's not the best friend to have. Any woman you wanna date will look at your friends and will see what you are endorsing being friends with him. The good ones will just kinda fade away not willing to get in between you two and questioning your morals for being friends with him.", "Then your best bet I'd to tell him upfront, you want to help him and see him happy but you don't see any way of being able to do so without him feeling like you are attacking him. It's not an attack at all, but younunderstand that it's most likely going to feel that way. So, you'd be happy to help but he has to understand and accept that what you're going to tell him is going to be hard for him to hear and accept. If he doesn't want to hear it that's fine, but that means you don't want to hear about anything to do with love/romantic life/interests and if he does end up asking for your advice from here on out you are going to take it that hebis accepting that it's going to make him uncomfortable but he won't lash back. \n\nYou warn him and put the ball in his court. He can make whatever decision he wants and it keeps you from having to hear about it if he doesn't actually want to know what he's doing wrong. And if he does bring it up it allows you to remind him that you already told him it was going to be brutal and by asking he accepted that fact and needs to deal with it, not take it out on you. And then if you walk away you won't feel as guilty bc he did it to himself", "That\u2019s something he could start with in therapy.", "NTA.  You're actually helping him save his job.", "NTA.", "NTA - you are discouraging him from being a complete creep. As a woman who\u2019s worked in retail, I hate being on either side of the counter during these exchanges. I\u2019ve had cashiers and customers try to flirt with me or ask me out on a date and it is the creepiest, most uncomfortable thing. It got to the point where I bought a cheap wedding band to wear while working, and that didn\u2019t even discourage it. Even cashiers that saw the band when I was grabbing something on the way home from work would still flirt. \n\nI\u2019ve had a couple situations where a cashier wouldn\u2019t give me my change or even accept my payment until I accepted their number. Your friend needs to realize he put that woman in an extremely uncomfortable situation and honestly could (and maybe *should* depending on how many times he\u2019s done this) lose his job.", "NTA", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m tryin to do. He gets paid pretty well and enjoys it. I\u2019d hate to see him lose that.", "Look, if I had a friend who wanted to take up fishing and decided to start at the community swimming pool, I would be a decent friend by saying \"Hey, this is a chlorinated pool, there are no fish here, go try somewhere else\" instead of letting him sit there getting nothing done until the lifeguards made him leave.  There are no fish in the swimming pool of his work - and you are being a good friend by telling him not to chase dead ends.  If he wants a date he needs to look somewhere where the women are looking back.  Women are extremely jaded about being approached while just tying to live their lives - you can't corner a girl into dating you.  He needs to go try a pond or a lake (singles night, dating apps).", "I have a master\u2019s degree and make a good living, and I\u2019d be totally willing to date a guy with your friend\u2019s job if I liked him and he treated me well. \n\nYou know who I\u2019m not willing to date? Creepy dudes who force their number on me against my will. \n\nThe reason he\u2019s not having luck with getting dates isn\u2019t his position, it\u2019s his behavior.", "If he keeps texting her that's just going to make her come back to his job and speak with someone higher up to get him to stop.", "You might know he\u2019s harmless, but the woman he harassed at his job only knows he\u2019s pushy, tramples over boundaries, and ignores social cues, which can be a red flag saying this dude is dangerous. If he works as a cashier at a place like a grocery store, that puts a lot of pressure on her to now avoid an essential place because its employees might be a threat", "Now that I think of it I do remember a few of those girls in high school. I have always felt bad for them. I sure hope nobody gives me any problems!", "You are so correct, so many times. He\u2019s a creep, no woman wants that. He needs to find a recreational place he\u2019s comfortable visiting (gym, park, bar) and go have a good time.", "I was buying a for sale sign at a local hardware store when the worker who helped me find them asked about what it was for. I said I was selling my car and he asked me about the car pretending to be interested. So I gave him my number, I figured it would be on the sign anyways and he only asked about my car never flirted. He texted me to ask me out, nothing about my car. I had a bf at the time and even said that but he kept texting me. I felt so uncomfortable I never went back. A few weeks later I was the grocery store in that same center and he saw me and stopped me to chat. I said I was busy and had to go and he still tried to talk. I just walked away and never went back to that shopping center. Thank you for trying to help him not be that guy, you are NTA.", "NTA and I\u2019m sure that woman would thank you if she knew\n\nHe should not be treating work like a singles mixer. He\u2019s lucky no one overheard him and that the customer didn\u2019t complain, because she was well within her rights. She came in to conduct a business transaction and he made it weird. She probably gave him her number because she was cornered and wanted to remove herself from the situation as soon as possible. On this one, he needs to delete her number and consider himself lucky he didn\u2019t lose his job.\n\nHe is clearly desperate, delusional or both. It seems like he needs a lot of help learning to tone it down. And he should stick to dating apps for the time being because 1 - you know the women there are looking to meet someone (unlike unsuspecting customers who just want to do what they came to do and leave), 2 - if she\u2019s not feeling him, it\u2019s easier for the woman to cut it off and not worry about him not taking the hint and getting creepy, and 3 - it will give him experience on how to have normal interactions with women.", "So I met my significant other in similar circumstances. \n\nBut so many differences. She was a regular for over 6 months, we had a repertoire with each other, and I made certain to never make her feel uncomfortable. She was there for a service and my feelings did not matter. \nIt was after I put in my two weeks notice that I gave her my number. That way I was leaving and if it didnt work out then it wouldnt make her uncomfortable to go back to my workplace. I let her text me first, I did not get her number(she texted me back that evening).", "NTA", "NTA but given that this is your friend, your delivery sucked. Your message was spot on, but people rarely learn from their mistakes after they\u2019ve been talked to like that.", "nta but you probably should've said it a different way especially if you know he already has problems in that area. yea the truth hurts but some people in that position, if givin the wrong advice or talking to they could turn into something dangerous. also most people dont realize its sometimes not what you say but its how you say it n if you said it in the way im thinking it probably most likely should've been a little lighter", "You\u2019re right about women wanting to run errands without being harassed.  I can\u2019t even count the number of times I\u2019ve felt unsafe because of unwanted attention.  If a guy forces the issue about exchanging numbers you have to weigh your desire to avoid the awkwardness with the desire to avoid being assaulted or murdered because you refused.  Thank you for trying to stop him from being That Guy.  Hopefully one of the lessons sticks before he escalates.", "Yep, NTA. I do not want to be hit on while shopping and I 100% do not visit businesses where I have an uncomfortable experience like that.", "NTA\n\nFirst, you're right that this could be seen as a fireable offense. It's not worth it to shoot your shot after a 30 second conversation. \n\nSecond, most people I know would also be put off by someone flirting with them that blatantly after 30s seconds while running errands. \n\nThird, he did his whole pick up line thing. If she had been into it, she would have given her number without needing further prompting. So apparently he not only doesn't know the proper place for flirting, he doesn't know when to drop the conversation. \n\nAnd based on your comments about him hitting on teenagers.... yikes. You might want to consider distancing yourself from this guy. \n\nI see in a lot of your comments you blame this all on his lack of socializing, but let's be real. The guy is in his mid-twenties. He's old enough to know better. And even if he somehow isn't, you've told him and he's not taking it well. You've also said in comments that he would respond to other attempts to help him as an insult. That's not a socialization problem, that's someone who refuses to admit they may be in the wrong. I don't socialize much either, but I know how to take genuine attempts from others to help me understand what I'm doing wrong.", "NTA\nIf she wanted to chat she would. You were brutally honest , but perhaps he needs it.", "Omfg teenagers HATE IT. it makes you want to peel the skin off your face. Its horrible and at that age it's shocking and you dont have the life experience yet to tell people to piss off. Tell him to knock it off with anyone close to being a minor.", "I was trying to check a book out at a library when I was 15 and a 30 something tried to pick me up and wouldn't leave me alone, even when I was at the counter. I pretended to call someone and asked to talk to \"my dad, Officer X\" and he suddenly disappeared. \n\nSo no, we don't like it when older men are creepy at us. It's extremely disturbing, especially at work or places where we're vulnerable and alone. If someone in their 20s and 30s is hitting on a teenager, we usually know it's because people in their own age bracket find them abhorrent. Ugh.", "I wonder if he might be on the spectrum. If so that\u2019s no excuse though. I\u2019m on it (not formally diagnosed but all my formally diagnosed aspie friends are adamant that I\u2019m one of them) and I\u2019ve had such difficulties myself but it took time and effort to learn and overcome them, which I have more or less.", "The only girls I knew who like the attention that young were extremely insecure with no positive Male relations in there life. But even when those women grow out of that; guess what they look back on those experiences with horror.", "She laughed at his request for a date, she stopped replying to him. She's not interested. She never was. You know it, I know it, we all know it.\n\nYou're not discouraging him from dating or putting himself out there. You're discouraging him from going after someone who isn't interested, and from being creepy at work.\n\n\nNTA", "You don't get fired for asking a girl out. If he was hot you wouldn't feel it was creepy and he wouldn't have had to ask for her number because she would have given it. It's not your job to correct him. You are not his parent. Stop using someone needing advice as an opportunity to kick them. I can tell you are no prize either.", "NTA ofc", "NTA Every creep needs a friend to tell him to stop being THAT guy.", "Ha, I remember being a combination of happy and flattered (because severe self esteem issues) and grossed out (because creepy) and it was the worst feeling. Ugh."]}
