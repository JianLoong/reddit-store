Set aside the bit about him possibly (fairly) facing professional consequences for this horseshit, you gave him legitimately solid advice - she's ghosting him, and not taking the hint is at best embarrassing.

That's how you react. You don't send more messages, you don't apologize, you don't ask what went wrong. You respect their choice, even if you don't like how they chose to execute it.\n\nTell him you support him dating and that is why you are giving him tips so he doesn't get in trouble and you're only discouraging him from taking advantage of women by hitting on them when they are in front of him for customer reasons and risking his job.

Also, his game doesn't even sound any good.  He sounds like he has a lot more to work on before he's somewhat datable.  As a guy who spent a lot of time being single, the key to success with women is to not take it all so seriously. If you get bent out of shape about every interaction and take every rejection as a definitive referendum on your entire personality you will psyche yourself out, miss real opportunities, and won't take enough shots for genuine and lasting success (however you define that).   \n It sounds like your friend is doing exactly that.

Trying to score a number from a customer who\u2019s just trying to do what she came in to do so she can get back to all the other shit she\u2019s got going on is not the time or the place.
