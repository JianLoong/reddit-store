A lot has happened within the last five months of the incident at what was supposed to be my 18th birthday party. There were many ups and downs that's just mentally drained me.\n\nAlright, first off... I blocked my family members. The toxic ones, at least. A lot of commenters suggested this, so I took this as the best course of action. I've been receiving call after call from my family members chastising me for making a scene, and \"breaking my cousin's trust with them\". My cousin was appalled by their behavior towards me and decided to cut all of them out. I've been living with my cousin for about a month after that point. I was able to get a job, and help out just a little.\n\n\nI started taking online classes and saving up some money for my own apartment, because I felt like I was being too big of a burden for my cousin. My cousin tried to stress that I was welcome to stay as long as I needed, but I told her that I was ready to leave everything behind. Back in October, I was packing some things up to get ready to move. My cousin told a family friend about this, and said-friend told my mother, who reached out to me on a burner account on Instagram asking if we could meet up and talk. My heart ached when I realized who it was. I haven't heard from my mother for four months by that point, so I was admittedly skeptical. This may have been a dumb move, but I agreed to come \u2014 under the condition that my cousin assisted me. We met up at a local restaurant, and I saw my mother for the first time in months. She looked depressed and lost a lot of weight, and seemed happy to see me... for once. She tried to hug me, but I stopped her. She respected that. We sat down and began to talk, catching up with everything. At the end of the conversation, she apologized and asked if we could start things over. As much as I wanted a relationship with my parents, I just told her that I couldn't forgive her for the past fifteen years. Of always making me feel unimportant, and making me feel worthless after all this time. I told her that for once in my life, I was legitimately happy, and that things would be better if we never spoke again. My mother, surprisingly, didn't contest this. She just hung her head, and paid the bill. \n\nThat happened a month ago. As of right now? I've moved far away from home halfway across the country. I'm still no-contact with my parents and toxic family members, I live in a small apartment, and I have a decent job as a waitress. My cousin, little brother, and I chat time to time and we're still doing as great as ever!\n\nIt's a bit quiet here, so I might adopt a puppy soon. I wish I could say it was a happy ending with a shit-ton of drama and everybody clapped at the end, but it's best to just tell the truth. Thank you everybody for your advice.", "created_utc": 1699639455, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17s9uy6/update_birthday_cake_incident/", "score": 194, "replies": ["I am so sorry that this happened for 15 years and really sorry that it happened on your milestone 18th Birthday.\n\nHaving said that, it is ok to remove yourself from toxic spaces and remove toxic people from u to our life. You learned a valuable life lesson which is that people treat us the way we allow them to. You stood up for yourself, you called them out and you moved on.\n\nCongrats on the move, job, and new apartment. Focus on building a new life for yourself. Try to get into school or a certificate program. Good luck. \u2618\ufe0f\u2618\ufe0f\u2618\ufe0f", "Sometimes, all you can do is remove yourself from a toxic situation & live the best life you can. So, from that point of view, you are doing hella better on your own than you would be living at your parents' house. You deserve good things in your life, free from toxicity. Keep on living your best life :)", "I am also very sorry this happened to you. I can't imagine how sad it must be to have to tell your own mom you think it would be best if you never spoke again, and for her to not even contest it. Maybe she knew she was wrong. And I'm not saying you should do anything differently - I'm just lamenting that you had to do it at all. \n\nAnd your dad, did he not even care to come? That also is telling. \n\nI hope you are happy. And I would really recommend therapy. It seems like you've gone through a lot in a short amount of time.. and a long amount of time.", "I remember your original post and I was so glad you at least had your cousin and little brother in your corner. \n\nI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re in a better place now and creating a life that involves the people who make you happiest. I hope things continue to get better for you and that you get the cutest puppy to share it all with! \n\nGood luck OP!", "Thank you for the update, I wish upon you a glorious future(with a puppy).", "Good to know you're doing well\n\nPeace is harder to get than happiness, but you made it. Your cousing and brother got your back.\n\nGood luck with your studies and your new life", "I hope the first thing you did in your new place was to sit down, cut a slice of Oreo cake, and eat it in your living room\n\n\nI must say, you have gumption.  I moved out at 23 at my parents prodding, staying all my life in the same city.  While you're out there far from home at 18 living your own life.  I don't know how far you'll go.  But I think you can handle what the world throws at you just fine.", "All the best, you deserve to be happy.", "Sorry you had to go through that for 15 years.\n\nAnd don't feel pressured to let your mother back in your life. But don't refuse just because reddit said it either. \n\nWhat is important is what makes you happy and at peace moving onwards. If that means slowly letting her back in, go for it, but carefully\n\nAnd if you cannot forget those 15 years, and there is no loving relationship to get back, only pain... then don't let her in. Don't let anyone make you feel like her regret gives her the right to be in your life now. She burned that bridge for 15 years. And only stopped burning it when consequences hurt her\n\nGood luck", "Man, I'm sorry you had to go through that! \ud83d\ude1e\n\nAlso, how are your cousin and brother doing? You said your cousin cut contract as well. \n\nOut of this whole thing it makes me wonder why would your family do such a thing?! I just don't understand the logic, no matter how AH-lish it was.\n\nBut I'm glad your doing alright! \ud83e\udd70\n\nAnd Please accept my \ud83e\udd67\ud83c\udf60\ud83c\udf57 and \ud83c\udf84\ud83e\udec2\ud83c\udf81", "You managed to move across the country in 4 months? In this economy? And living on your own on a waitress's income? How??", "My dad never really cared too much about me, so he was pretty indifferent after I cut him off.\n\nAnd I'm working on finding therapy, it's just quite expensive.", "They're both doing fine! Though, my cousin still sometimes gets requests on her Instagram to get followed by our family members. (She privated it since our grandmother kept spam-commenting on all her posts.)", "I've been saving up money for a few years, especially since I knew that I didn't want to stay in that area anymore. Not going to lie, this was impulsive and risky, but I'm surprised that I'm staying alive.", "Are you in the USA? If so take the questionnaire on Benefits.Gov and it will tell you any and all Benefits you are eligible for and how to apply. Good luck to you.", "If I  might make a suggestion...look into getting a job at the post office. It's decent pay with good benefits including EAP(employee assistance program, for mental health.) If you don't mind being outdoors go for being a mail carrier (though it can be stressful) or if you prefer indoors look into going into the clerk craft. Currently you can retire at 55 years old if you have at least (I think) 20 years (might be 25 yrs) of service.\n\nI'm glad you were able to get out on your own and hope you continue living your best life.", "I am in the USA! And thank you fot the help!", "You are welcome. You may find mental health resources there."]}
