My friend (23f) does not. I helped her get a job in the town I work in which is about 25 minutes away from where I live. I wanted to help her because she hasn\u2019t had a job in a while, and I know she desperately needed one. Since she does not have a car or her license, I told her I\u2019d be willing to give her rides as long as she would try to get her license. My only condition was that she would get her license before I went on a trip. She started about a month and a half before my trip. I told her I would be comfortable leaving my car with her while I was gone so she could take herself to home from work. Every time she would get a paycheck she would spend it on stuff other than her license. Which is fine I don\u2019t want to control what she buys but I also made it very clear that her priority was her license. She started making up excuses saying she didn\u2019t wanna learn to drive when it starts snowing. (We live up north but it hasn\u2019t started snowing yet), or that I have to stop pressuring her. I even offered to help her get a car after she got her license. She keeps talking to me about how she wants to buy this and this and every time I remind her about her license she would bitch at me to tell me to stop controlling her and that I\u2019m not her mom and she can do whatever she wants with her money.  It was to the point where I was taking her to and from work even on my days off so I didn\u2019t get to relax. It was very stressful. So my trip came and she didn\u2019t have a license. So I told her I wasn\u2019t leaving my car with her because I didn\u2019t feel comfortable having her mom drive my car. And she made me feel bad saying \u201coh I\u2019m gonna lose my job\u201d or \u201cjust let my mom drive your car\u201d.  I\u2019m at the point where I feel like she\u2019s taking advantage of me, and now I just wanna stop giving her rides to work. I told her she had until the end of the month to figure out what she\u2019s going to do as far as rides to work because when December starts, I\u2019m no longer willing to give her a ride to work. She called me an asshole saying I promised her I would keep giving her a ride until she got her license. But I only promise to give her rides as long as she was making the effort to get her license and I wanted her to get her license before I left for my trip. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n\nEdit: forgot to add this to the post but she gives me about $10 in gas every week.", "created_utc": 1667542410, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylqlx8/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_my_friend_a_ride_to/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s long past taking advantage of you! She is acting entitled. She won\u2019t stop until you put a stop to it. She isn\u2019t your responsibility. Don\u2019t give her anymore rides or money for a car.", "NTA. Sweetheart, you are allowing her to walk all over you. If it were me, I would have stopped already and would have blocked her number by now. I would do exactly what you said and tell her that December 1st you are not coming to pick her up. She should be in charge of herself. You are not her mom.", "NTA, you made the conditions of your help clear and she failed to meet her quota. Your car, your choice, just be prepared to loose this friendship.", "NTA, you gave her ample time to get her license\n\nDefinitely taking advantage of you", "NTA. She\u2019s clearly not trying to help herself here at all, so it definitely isn\u2019t your responsibility to do it instead. She\u2019s had the chance for sure!", "NTA\n\nAssuming what you say you said is what you actually said. You said you would give her rides to work until she got her DL but she had to have it before your trip. You are back from your trip, are you not?

Is it possible that you could give her a ride only when you are going to work.   If you drop the \"get a license\" condition, and limit rides to when it fits with your driving schedule ... all of her complaints are eliminated.

But I suspect your friend has a fear of driving, and that is why she keeps putting it off.\n\nIt would be kind of you to help your friend find a solution that doesn't involve her taking advantage of your generosity forever.  Perhaps you'd feel better about driving her if she contributed toward gas and wear-and-tear on your car? And could your friend get a bus, taxi, or Uber/Lyft to work while you are on your trip so you don't have to worry about anyone driving your car?  Perhaps she should work on finding an apartment within walking distance of work, or on a bus route.\n\nEdit: wait, I see that I misread and you already went on your trip.  How did she get to work during that time?", "INFO. Does she give you money to help with gas?\n\neither way tho, NTA. You don't have to take her back and forth and you didn't have to be kind enough to offer. Thanks to you she had money in her pocket and new things to enjoy. She should have appreciated that and saved for her license AND a vehicle. She's 23.. She needs to start acting her age. I personally won't let ANYONE drive my car but my boyfriend (he technically owns the car) even my own best friend who is my sister, I don't allow her to drive my car. Accidents happen everyday and I can't afford to let anyone ever take the chance of an accident in my car, insurance wouldn't cover it if the driver isn't on the insurance. She completely understands and respects my choice. My point being that your friend should be soooooo fucking thankfully for you, you're an angel.", "NTA Your friend needs to grow up. She can Uber or ask her own mom to give her rides.", "NTA. Feel free to agree with her. You are not her mother. You are not her sister. But you are also not her chauffeur. She will simply need to find a different way to get to work, because you would like some more flexibility in your schedule and it is not convenient for you to be driving her. It's really hard to untangle yourself when you start out doing a good deed. And you don't want to become hostile. I went through this with someone from church, a single mother. She lived right on the way from me and at first I didn't mind taking her. But I was simply not as enthusiastic as she was about going to church every single Sunday. After a while, she could sense my irritation and found someone else to go with. We were closer friends when I was driving her every Sunday, but it fell off quickly after I stopped. That's how it goes sometimes.", "NTA and this girl is too old to be this entitled and clueless. You were clear about the stipulations and she absolutely is taking advantage now then trying to guilt trip you instead of taking responsibility. I don't know where you live but where I live $10/wk for gas for that much driving would be laughable. I would reconsider why you're friends with this person. People like this will always be needing something from you but never give back or even appreciate the help.", "NTA she\u2019s right that you can\u2019t control what she does with her money, just like she can\u2019t control what you do with your car. Freedom has to go both ways", "Info requested:\n\nWhat country do you live in and how much does it cost to get a license there? \n\nI only ask out of curiosity as to why she can\u2019t afford it, even with blowing her money on other stuff. No matter how much it costs you\u2019re NTA. You helped her out a lot and made your conditions on your time and effort clear. She couldn\u2019t fulfill the conditions so that\u2019s on her.", "NTA. That\u2019s not a friendship, she\u2019s using you. You are not responding for her getting to work. That\u2019s ridiculous.", "If I lose this friendship, I honestly will not be that upset.", "I am back from my trip, I was hoping she would maybe get her license while I was gone, but apparently not. (I was gone for two weeks.)", "I don\u2019t necessarily mind giving her a ride to work when we both have to work but she works earlier than I do so I have to wake up earlier so I can make sure she gets to work on time. I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m starting to get annoyed because I have to get up earlier.", "And before you all jump all over me for suggesting that she help her friend find a solution when it's not her responsibility to do so, I fully agree that it's not her responsibility.  However, not everyone has great life skills and problem solving capabilities at 23 so I suggested that it would be a kind thing to help her find a better solution.", "Yes, about $10 a week. I forgot to add that to the post.", "Getting up early for her benefit is out of the question.   She isn't showing the same consideration for you.   Friendship is about sharing.   She isn't sharing.", "All I know is that sometimes she got a ride from her neighbor and sometimes she got a ride from my mom.\n\nI\u2019ve tried offering her solutions, but I don\u2019t really have a lot to be honest because we don\u2019t have public transportation in my town, and Lyfts/ Ubers are about $45 each way. \n\nShe never told me that she was anxious to drive. In fact, she made it sound like she was excited to learn, and was pumped about getting her license.", "A week? ... She is using you..she is an adult, if she wants to keep working she will figure it out.   You even go earlier than you should... Helping friends is nice you wanted for her to improve her life... But you can't force her to improve it, just like she can force you to be her chauffeur.\n\nDo not lend your car.. she is too irresponsible.  what would happen if they crash? Would she say uppsie sorry.. or do you think she will pay to fix it... \n\nGood luck"]}
