We get along great and I love almost everything about him except for his selfishness. In our times together, I\u2019ve never seen him give anything to any cause even though he makes good money.\n\n We\u2019ve been to the grocery stores together many times and when the cashiers ask if he wants to donate, he always said no. One time we got into an argument because the cashier asked if I wanted to donate $1 to a children hospital and he said no. Who doesn\u2019t donate to the children hospital?!? Whenever we are stop at a red light, he never gives anything to the people at the corner asking for money. Never, not once.\n\nRecently a friend of mine got pregnant and her boyfriend bailed. Her parents said she\u2019s old enough to figure things out for herself so they\u2019re not helping her. She\u2019s 25 but they\u2019re still AH for that. Anyway, I threw her a baby shower because I know she\u2019ll need things as a single mother. Jack came and brought literally the cheapest thing on the registry, a bag of diapers. I was disappointed in him as I previously told him it\u2019d be nice if he got her the bugaboo stroller or the clek car seat, you know, something she really needs. We got into an argument about that too.\n\nI was at his house the other day when he got a package in. He opened it and showed me it was a new bottle of cologne and had me smell it. Although it smelled fantastic, I was speechless when I saw the invoice. He paid $450 for a bottle of cologne when all he bought for my friend was a bag of diapers. I saw red and went off on him.\n\nI know I\u2019m the better person and right but my sister is telling me I was being too harsh because he can spend his money anyway he wants to. I said told her he can do better.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668724953, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yy3xol/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_hes_selfish_for/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't give to charity because I believe it goes to ceos. I do give to local groups, but that isn't the point. It's his money. You want to buy your friend a gift, do it. Why should he?", "YTA what gives you the right to dictate how he spends his money. Is he a bit of a self centered AH, yes.

If donation and charity are important values to you (and to be clear, you do this yourself, don't just guilt others into donating their money), and he is someone who wants to spend everything on himself, that sounds like a big moral divide and you might both do better to find partners that match your values.", "Yta. \n\n> I was disappointed in him as I previously told him it\u2019d be nice if he got her the bugaboo stroller or the clek car seat, you know, something she really needs\n\nI just googled the price of those 2 things and Jesus christ. I wouldn't buy those for MY best friend let alone one of my partners friends.", "LOL what? YTA.\n\nListen, I agree that when we have it good, we should give. I wish we lived in a world where we didn't have to. I give to charity regularly, but I also don't give cash to people on the side of the road or charities I know nothing about. Sometimes I do give at checkout if it's a charity I know and like, but not always by any stretch.\n\nI'm also personally of the opinion that I'd rather give than have expensive crap I don't need. I'd want to be with someone who shares these values, and I personally wouldn't want to be with someone who had wealth and chose not to be generous with it.\n\nBut you never even mentioned whether your boyfriend gives in other ways, just these personal observations about how he doesn't just throw money at someone because they asked. And to pick an argument over it is just unreasonable.\n\nIf your boyfriend's values don't align with yours, then no, you don't get along great. And your insistence on his *performing* to align with your values is... frankly, unreal.", "YTA. And selfish. Why do you get to decide how he spends his money? And why do customers have to donate instead of the billion dollar company? Oh , wait, so they can take the credit and tax write off for your donation. Team BF. Stop spending other people\u2019s $.", "YTA - Why would your BF buy an incredibly expensive baby shower gift for someone he barely knows? He barely even knows you. You've only been dating for 6 months, get your hands out of his wallet.", "YTA. The worst type of people are those that spend other people\u2019s money for them. You also sound super naive.", "I never donate to those $1 requests at cashiers. I prefer to donate for charities I choose.\n\nHim having money doesn't mean he is obliged to buy your friend an expensive stroller.\n\nYou have a weird view on his money and choices of expenditures.

The fact you say you know your right is wrong as hell.", "Lol yta you are the worst kind of person lol. You feel good about supporting corporations which is what you are doing donating at the cash, lowering their tax bill. He bought your friend that he doesn\u2019t know a gift and he is in the wrong for buying himself something. Get your judgy self outta here . What a joke", "YTA. You do not get a say on what he does with his money. Why on earth would you expect him to buy a $1000+ stroller for a person he barely knows???", "YTA he has no obligation to help your friend and just because he bought himself cologne doesn't make you a better person. It's great you want to help your friend but you can't make that someone else's responsibility.", "You seem super controlling - after just 6 months of dating someone you think you get to tell him how to spend his money? Wow, yeah YTA.", "Anyone else check the price on that stroller? She's struggling but needs a $1000+ stroller? YTA he got her something she will need, cause diapers are expensive AF and you go through 100s of them.", "YTA\n\nNot your money, not your concern.\n\nIf you want a more generous boyfriend, get one.", "Yta....like your sister said its his money he can do what he wants.\n\nAnd he isn't obligated to do anything for your friend and he bought diapers get over yourself before he decides to dump you.", "YTA\n\nWhat is wrong with you?! You sound so jealous, bitter and judgemental. He can spend his money however he wants and doesn't have to donate to anything.", "\" I said told her he can do better.\"  by finding a new girlfriend.  YTA.  Who are YOU to decide how he spends HIS money after 6 months of knowing him.  I give money sometimes at stores, but I also know it helps the company more than it helps the charity.  \n\nI USED to give money to people at red lights, now I VERY RARELY do, because some of them have taken that as in invitation to jump into the car with me and ask for a ride...it is very hard to get them out at that point without giving them a ride, and when they get there, they also need $20 (and when you are younger, you give it to them just to get them out of your car, which is what they are counting on).  You have known him for 6 months, you have no idea what kind of life experiences he has had.\n\nMy point is, most of the time (in my experience), giving money away is more about YOU, and how it makes you feel like a good person, not about actually helping people...and that's fine, you are free to do whatever you want with your money, but you are not entitled to a second hand high from giving other people's money away.", "YTA. Your also a self righteous loser. It's his money. He can spend it as he chooses. What didn't you buy the stroller? Too cheap?", "YTA - Charity donations are optional. If he doesn't want to donate, he doesn't have to.\n\nHe earns the money and can spend it however he sees fit. You don't have to like it.\n\nThat \"I know I'm the better person\" line reflects really badly on you. If him not giving to others is this much of a dealbreaker for you then you can always end the relationship.\n\nI also don't see any reference to your charitable donations or gift purchases. Maybe you're extremely charitable and not compatible with him, or maybe you also don't give and are looking for him to do it for the both of you?", "YTA his money his decision. Get off your high horse.", "YTA. Youre not his mom. If you dislike the way he is, stop dating him. Do Not try to control his finances via manipulation. That is why you are the asshole.", "Yta. His money to spend as he sees fit. Btw I don't round up or donate at the store anymore either. Why should I donate through the store so the store gets the write off on their taxes? Donate directly.", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t give to cashier donations either because they can be sketchy. Would rather do my own thing. And it\u2019s a GD dollar, it\u2019s not going very far.\n\nI don\u2019t give to people on the street, it\u2019s a safety concern.\n\nHe bought a gift for your friend who he\u2019s probably met like twice over the past six months, and that\u2019s not good enough for you?? Why should he shell out $$$ when he barely knows you let alone your friend?\n\nYour priorities are all out of whack. You\u2019re expecting husband level shit from your bf of six months. That\u2019s insane.\n\nAnd honestly at 25 your friend should take care of herself and her baby, or have an alternative plan.

And as for giving to people on the street and retail establishments that ask for donations- good for you if you do it but it doesn\u2019t make you better than anyone else.

Just because you don't see your bf giving a dollar here or there, doesn't mean he doesn't give in other ways when you're not around.  And even if he doesn't, that's his choice.

Why should he subsidize your friends expenses? Or anyone elses. Not your money to spend!", "YTA good grief. Your friend needs diapers the absolute most. You\u2019re super hung up on money.", "YTA. You've only been with him for six months. He might not want to donate money through a grocery store for many reasons. I prefer to give directly. And it's unbelievable that you would ask him to buy a gift for your friend that' costs hundreds of dollars. She's your friend, not his. If you wanted your friend to have these items, you could have had your mutual friends pull their money together to buy them for her. \n\nMaybe your boyfriend is selfish. That's something you need to decide if you can live with or not--that's why people date. But your examples don't make much of a case for him being selfish.", "Oh your Boyfriend is selfish?

YTA... count your own money not his.", "YTA for making us read this work of fiction.", "INFO: if you're convinced that you are right, why are you asking here? For reassurance?", "YTA. First of all, I NEVER donate to those charities through the grocery store because the store ends up just using it as a tax write off. I would much rather donate directly to a charity of my choosing.\n\nSecondly, it's literally none of your business what your boyfriend does with his money, especially since you've only been together for 6 months. Your boyfriend is in no way obligated to help your friend at all, and he still bought her something off of your registry. Who are you to say what is 'enough'?", "YTA- One, never donate to a store for ANY cause. Do they use it for that, yes, but they get a tax write off for it. They get paid to use YOUR money to donate in THEIR name. It's a scam.\n\nTwo, this is only a 6 month relationship. No shit he's not shelling out big money for someone he doesn't know who is the relative of someone he BARELY knows.

He should probably find a gf who actually likes him.", "YTA you're very controlling over money that isn't yours", "YTA how he spends his money is upto him because it's his money and he has sent it. It's HIS choice whether or not he wants to donate to charities or not, and why should he buy your friend expensive gifts for her baby? He ain't that babies daddy?", "YTA.\n\nThis is still a newer relationship. You can\u2019t expect him treat your friends like family when he barely knows them. \n\nNot to mention, someone who is relying on others needs a stroller, period.

Better to give to an association that works with the homeless and can get economies of scale and actual work done.

You don't have to give to causes, or anyone for that matter.  What you do to make yourself feel good at night doesn't need to be enforced on another person.

It\u2019s really not your business, his finances are not your business, and why the hell would he pay for a 1000$ stroller for someone he doesn\u2019t even know?

It's really easy to be charitable with other people's money. I noticed you didn't mention anything about donating yourself or buying expensive gifts for YOUR friend (yours not his). Why should he? Diapers are a very good gift and he barely knows this person. You never ever should donate at light stops because it's a safety risk and there's a high chance they are scammers or drug addicts (it sucks for the legitimate homeless but its what it is). You don't donate at grocery stores because you're not sure if it goes to them and if it does they are using it for tax write off. Always donate directly to a charity if you want it. \n\nIf you got disposable income there is nothing wrong in buying an expensive perfume. All the things you mentioned only make you seem entitled, shallow and annoying. Keep at it and he will tire of you.\n\nAnd if you truly want a more \"generous\" boyfriend. This guy clearly ain't it. Stop wasting yours and his time.", "My word YTA. It's HIS money stop trying to dictate who and what he spends it on. He doesn't owe YOUR friend a single thing. Many people don't give panhandlers anything because they're scamming. Many don't give at checkouts because they donate to charities they want and not mass ones that often do not handle funds correctly. You are incredibly judgmental and, yes, sounds like he can do better and hopefully realizes before it's too late and takes off.", "YTA.   How he spends his money is up to him.  How do you know he doesn't have charities  he supports already?", "YTA-  for being upset with him because it\u2019s his money.  However, if you are a giving person to the needy and he\u2019s not maybe he\u2019s not the right guy for you.", "YTA! As it turns out.

When I was a kid my dad had a friend who wouldn't donate to United Way. I asked him why and he said it was because he was forced to donate via his paycheck when he was a young man. It was an automatic deduction and he had no say in it. He was in his 50s at the time so it had to have been in the 1960/1970s. However, it stuck with him and United Way became the one charity he would refuse to donate to everytime. I feel the same way.\n\nOP is TA.

Our financial advisor pointed us to a list that ranks charities on how much they spend on their cause vs themselves. The ones doing fundraising at our school tended to be at the bottom of that list.

Sure it was bigger, had the sit and stand function, and had a storage basket underneath(and a few other features I'm blanking on RN) but it was much more bulky harder to push and I honestly hated it. My cheap double umbrella stroller is light, easy to collapse, and much easier to push. It might not have storage but that is what back packs are for(either wear them on your back or I like to make the stroller 'wear' it. \n\nThe only thing I will not buy for less than 150$ is an infant carrier and base and the next stage up.
