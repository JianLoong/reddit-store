Today the slice was still in the fridge and while my daughter was at work I cut off a sliver and ate it. When she came home she asked if I\u2019d taken half of it. I said \u201cno.\u201d She then asked my wife if she\u2019d had some and she also said no. My daughter accused me of lying and so I said that I \u201cdidn\u2019t take half I took a sliver\u201d she got extremely upset saying that it was HER slice. I asked how it was hers and she said because she paid for the cake, so then I asked if the same applied to the rest of the food in the house (that I pay for) and she stormed off to her room.

I'm not gonna pretend this is, in any way, about the cake. You easily could have gone to the store and gotten your own.

That way, when confronted, you can put on the bumbling dad face and say, \"What? It's just cake!\" The thing is, you show your true colors in your smug and taunting response, and I think that's because this was all an elaborate set-up specifically so you could have an excuse to remind her that *anything she owns, you own. Because you own* ***her.*** You were never gonna apologize like a normal person because you are not one. Your well-practiced tactics, and your daughter's reaction (extreme distress that seems disproportional on the surface, and the fact that she knows it's better to just leave than confront you on your disrespect) indicates an ugly history here.
