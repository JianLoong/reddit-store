Today the slice was still in the fridge and while my daughter was at work I cut off a sliver and ate it. When she came home she asked if I\u2019d taken half of it. I said \u201cno.\u201d She then asked my wife if she\u2019d had some and she also said no. My daughter accused me of lying and so I said that I \u201cdidn\u2019t take half I took a sliver\u201d she got extremely upset saying that it was HER slice. I asked how it was hers and she said because she paid for the cake, so then I asked if the same applied to the rest of the food in the house (that I pay for) and she stormed off to her room.

I'm not gonna pretend this is, in any way, about the cake. You easily could have gone to the store and gotten your own.

That way, when confronted, you can put on the bumbling dad face and say, \"What? It's just cake!\" The thing is, you show your true colors in your smug and taunting response, and I think that's because this was all an elaborate set-up specifically so you could have an excuse to remind her that *anything she owns, you own. Because you own* ***her.*** You were never gonna apologize like a normal person because you are not one. Your well-practiced tactics, and your daughter's reaction (extreme distress that seems disproportional on the surface, and the fact that she knows it's better to just leave than confront you on your disrespect) indicates an ugly history here.

YTA OP, and I hope your daughter takes you up on your implications and works towards getting her own place where her ability to enjoy things isn't dependent on you.", "Ya'll should see his one comment on his profile. And YES it's about cake! This man has a food problem and is obsessed with cake. I feel sorry for his daughter.\n\nEdited: spelling error", "We'll see how powerful OP feels when their daughter cuts off contact in a few years.", "Exactly this! He didn't even have the guts to fess up and apologize. \nIf my dad did this to me, I'd demand him to buy a new cake entirely.\n\nOp YTA", "Worrrd. I grew up in a household like this and it really broke down my relationship with respect and boundaries. I ended up letting people walk all over me because my attempts at boundary setting would be ignored or retaliated against at home.", "I wanna know why he couldn't just buy his own fancy cake if he wanted it so badly? Then he could eat the entire thing, since he bought it and all!", "Have", "lol, way to  shoehorn in sexism.", "Not having much money should have taught you to respect other people's property.\n\nGuess not though.", "Its not a sliver of cake it's a boundary. Good on you for being a doormat though.", "Yout parents would disown you for claiming a slice if cake? I'm sorry", "Totally agree w you. Everyone\u2019s saying \u201crespect your daughter.\u201d It\u2019s literally a piece of cake. Who gives a shit if he ate a sliver of it, considering he has fed her and paid for her food her entire life. Y\u2019all acting like he stole $10,000 from her. Dad, as far as I\u2019m concerned, eat the rest of the damn cake and tell your entitled daughter to get over herself", "She's 21, so no.", "Toxicity at its peak", "Like, greedy people who eat cake that doesn't belong to them?", "So why are you siding with the greedy person?", "She did share with him. He literally got a piece, but was told no regarding the last piece. She wasn't selfish because she *gave* him a piece. He just wanted more & couldn't respect being told no. If he was actually right & believed he wasn't doing anything wrong he wouldn't have *lied* at first when she asked nor ate it when nobody was around. He was wrong here. Not her.", "I've baked a black forest cake, and it takes a lot of effort and expensive ingredients.\n\nYTA, OP. If cake is more important to you than respecting your daughter's boundaries, then you should seriously seek help.", "My sister stabbed my dad with a fork for trying to take food off of her plate.\n\nHe didn\u2019t do it again.\n\nSome people gotta learn the hard way.", "We used to have to hide the Halloween trick or treat candy every year when I was a kid. if my dad found it he'd eat it all. He'd eat an entire bag of those \"fun size\" candy bars by himself!", "I also had this thought when he lied about eating it.", "This is really well put.", "And lied about it", "If they can pay for the rest of the food they can drag their lazy ass to buy another cake. A WHOLE cake, to replace the slice they shamefully stole. And if they can be decent they won\u2019t ask for OR take even a sliver of the replacement apology cake. \n\nAnd you know what? Daughter is probably good enough to share the new cake with the selfish greedy cake sliver thief. SO petty. \n\nThis ain\u2019t the first sliver taken shamelessly either I guarantee ya that", "She even did share with them, just not the last piece", "And he's 50 & can't not touch a piece of cake (after already being given a slice so she didn't keep him from having any) nor respect no when he's been told it multiple times. He most certainly was using a power play because he had no leg to stand on period since I'm positive he tells her no regarding certain things he buys & expects her to respect it like she expected of him. OP YTA.", "It's not about being a doormat, its about realising how much emotion you want to attach to something which is not relevant in the larger picture and how much energy you want to exude into this. If a piece of cake can do this much damage, I wonder when real life actually hits how the daughter is going to handle it. I have struggled with the same hence can tell you. \n\nI bet if the father passed away in his sleep after eating the cake, the daughter would not be able to live with the burden that her last words to her dad was \" you are an asshole for eating my cake slice\" and then didnt talk to him ever again.", "Where didi say she's wrong about this? A person cannot be called an asshole for eating a bit of cake. That's ridiculous of course. Not treating your daughter right in the long term is the asshole part. From this information given we can only ask further questions and not place judgement too fast. It's just cake but the boundaries have been destroyed long before this silly situation", "In his childish head he didn't lie, because he didn't eat \"half\" he ate a \"sliver\" which is pretty pathetic.", "He shouldn't have been an asshole then. Just because your parents gave you shit and you ate it doesn't mean the rest of us have to. Imagine If the girl died and the last thing dad did was steal her cake? Is that better? What is \"real life\" to you?", "I'm just saying she's not wrong. She shared the cake & wasn't selfish. I agree about the boundaries before given his reaction to being called out & hers for him directing her no. However, someone can be called an AH for eating cake when they've been told no multiple times about it, did it anyway, lied when asked about it, & then threw a fit when caught. It's not about the Iranian yogurt.", "Nope, just seeing where the line is with this temptation thing", "If I did that my dog.would eat it", "Only cakes with cream or cream cheese icing need to be in the fridge. Buttercream is fine out for days (covered) unless you are somewhere hot and then the issue is mainly it melting rather than safety."]}
