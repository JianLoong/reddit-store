Just having the excuse of \"it's boring\" is questionable all by itself but you can't be bothered to dig deeper to find the root of her issue with her mother.

It's easier to suss out those \"I fucked up\" moments when you have constant contact with someone.

And you won't always be able to enable/shield her from it.\n\nIt sounds like you don't know what the reason is either, correct?  I think a conversation with your daughter is the place to start.  Simply trying to put the conflict into words is very powerful.  Unless I'm missing a huge part of what is actually going on, she is learning to avoid conflict through lies, not resolve it.  It's up to you as the parent to help her realize the power of her convictions and the strength of healthy boundaries.  \n\nThe key point is that she's not learning boundaries by pretending to be \"unavailable\" when her mother calls.  She's learning to avoid discomfort at all costs, because setting boundaries is not comfortable.", "And I'm not saying you're in the wrong here, because you are respecting your daughter's decision.

He was extremely self-centered and I quickly went from feeling neutral towards him to getting annoyed and frustrated every time he called. Sometimes he\u2019d call during class, or late at night when I was trying to sleep, and if I failed to pick up, he would get upset because he was \u201cgoing through a hard time.\u201d\n\nYour daughter may be going through similar emotions regarding her mother. I\u2019m lucky enough to be an adult who is \u201callowed\u201d to ignore my father if I really want to, while your daughter is a teenager and less at liberty to avoid her mother.

I'm not sure society could function without white lies (see: \"do these pants make me look fat?\").  If the daughter doesn't have a problem with mom but just doesn't want to talk as often as mom would like (which would be the case for just about every 14-year old on the planet), then not being available seems a lot less hurtful than saying \"mom, I do not want to talk with you.\"", "Respectfully and honestly speaking, can you give me an example of what he is supposed to do or say to get her to pick up the phone short of rethinking this whole custody arrangement which I think they should personally.", "if you see your mother once a year because of a custody battle, you too wouldn\u2019t have much of a relationship with her. OP\u2019s daughter likely sees her mother like a stranger who she\u2019s obligated to force a relationship with by the law. if her mother wanted to see her so bad and misses her so bad, why doesn\u2019t *she* fly out? \n\nbased on the limited info we have, the mother sounds like she\u2019s doing the bare minimum of parenting. if i were her and my daughter said she doesnt wanna talk to me, i\u2019d look within and re-evaluate my \u201cparenting\u201d instead of throwing a temper tantrum and attacking the parent who actually stepped up to the job.", "Well the daughter says the lies and he repeats them but point taken.", "History is not boring! The audacity!", "History is fun tho\u2026", "If this was the other way around would be judging negatively saying that the mom is responsible for ensuring that the daughter has a good relationship with the father. This should be no different. You\u2019re supposed to foster good relationships with the other parent", "Everything else aside, you are teaching your child to lie.  That alone makes you an AH.  My ex is a compulsive liar.  And guess what?  All 3 of our kids have started lying.  It sucks when you can't trust your iwn kids.  Sucks more when you realize you're to blame.  Trust me.  I don't lie, but I allowed him to manipulate me with his lies for years.  Had I stopped him, my kids wouldn't have learned it from him.  You'll regret teaching her to lie when she starts lying to you.", "It would be your responsibility to ask that if you and your ex were together. However, she's your ex for a reason. If you force her to talk with her mom, you'll be the one being left out next time. NTA.\n\nEdit: Tbh YTA for lying about it, you should've just said \"she doesn't wanna speak to you\" and then hung up.\n\nEdit 2: Your daughter's the real asshole. I could never imagine doing that io my parents. If you look through her mom's perspective, I bet she really doesn't know what she did wrong and she's probably crying now.", "NTA I actually grew up just like your daughter. My dad lived overseas since I was 7 and I saw him in the summer and some holidays. I don\u2019t know how long your daughter has been dealing with this or the exact situation but I held a lot of resentment towards my dad when I was a teenager. I also developed coping mechanisms to kinda push down missing him but that was much harder to do when I talked to him. It made me really not want to answer his calls and made me surly about the whole thing because I also felt badly.  And I didn\u2019t really tell my mom the reasoning. I distinctly remember saying it was boring. I completely understand what your daughter might be feeling right now. Highly recommend considering therapy to help her work through the feelings of having her mom live in a different country. Given that your ex yelled at you, I\u2019m guessing if you had said daughter didn\u2019t want to talk she wouldn\u2019t have taken kindly to it, so maybe that was a good choice. But it might help their relationship in the long run if you\u2019re more transparent.", "ETAH. Every. Single. One. Of. You.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that probably 90% of 14 year olds are going to say that talking to their parents is boring. They still need to talk. Because your daughter lives with you, you need to be encouraging their conversations not facilitating the lack of them. You definitely shouldn\u2019t be lying to cover for your daughter. Perhaps FaceTime (or Zoom, or whatever service you prefer) would be less \u201cboring\u201d.\n\nYour daughter has to understand that relationships go both ways. If the conversations are \u201cboring\u201d then she\u2019s half the problem. But make it clear she needs to talk with her mother. You\u2019re a parent. Be one.\n\nYour ex shouldn\u2019t have yelled at her, but can you really blame her? She just found out that you and her daughter have been intentionally avoiding her. Put yourself in her shoes. You\u2019d be pissed yourself.", "Projecting. Nowhere did OP say the mom was a dead beat.", "My parents refused to cover for me if someone called. (This was before caller ID, btw.) They never did that for each other, either. I had no choice but to speak to that person. Mom gave me ideas for how to cut a conversation short, but it was still up to me to deal with it.", "What I said,\n\nDon't teach your daughter to lie.\n\nWhat you heard,\n\nForce your daughter to speak to her mother.", "And yet look where it led. It doesn\u2019t seem less hurtful now does it?", "He could tell her if she doesn't want to talk to her mother, instead of her lying, and him lying to cover it she needs to tell her mother herself that she doesn't want to. Lying is not okay.", "Loud and wrong. There was no custody battle.", "You said she was boring on one comment now she\u2019s done something? Which is it?"]}
