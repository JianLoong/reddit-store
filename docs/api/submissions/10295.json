At that age it could be something big or it could be something so minor, you never know but if you get to the bottom of it you can understand and figure out where to go from there.", "YTA\n\nDo not teach your daughter to lie.

I don\u2019t think you should be forcing your daughter to talk to her mother but you shouldn\u2019t be lying for her either.  Your daughter is old enough to own her choices.

You shouldn't force her to talk to her mom. \n\nHowever, as a parent, when you notice a major shift in an important relationship, you should be asking questions. If something bad has happened to make her not want to talk to her mom you need to know about it so that you can support her. Losing a relationship with a parent is hard and you should not make her do it alone. If the reason she doesn't want to talk is super tiny you need to be working with her on her communication and conflict resolution skills. She doesn't have to talk right away but you also don't want to be raising an adult who runs away from every relationship over small conflict. You need to make sure she has the skills that it takes to make that choice intentionally when it's necessary to and not just whenever it's hard to have a relationship.", "NTA.  Forcing a kid to interact with a parent they want no contact with will only destroy the bond both parents have with her.  \n\nMy bet is that something went down between them the last time your daughter went to visit.", "ESH, except your daughter.

This could go under parent alienation.", "i need more info", "I did she said it's boring\n\nI don't live with my ex so I don't know what she had done to be so boring for my daughter", "You are allowing your daughter to use you against her mother.", "As teenagers they can decide to talk or not talk.

She needs to figure out why my daughter doesn't want to talk to her anymore", "The kid is 14. I think it's fair not to expect a 14 year old to stand up to their own parent.", ".....And you didn't think to ask them either one of them what was really going on!? I have a 14 year old son, and if I discovered that he repeatedly didn't want to talk to a family member anymore, let alone someone as important as a parent, I'd be sitting him down to talk to him and ask him what's going on.  Just having the excuse of \"it's boring\" is questionable all by itself but you can't be bothered to dig deeper to find the root of her issue with her mother. Seems like you're mentally checked out of your daughter's personal life and just going through the motions of raising her. Not to mention, you're teaching her bad life habits by using you to lie to her mother instead of teaching her to be responsible and tell mother how she really feels. Smh YTA", "History is boring. I bet if you found out your daughter was skipping history classes you\u2019d actually do more than accept it. Major YTA. Your ex was wrong for yelling but honestly I can\u2019t blame her given what she found out", "It is her daughter to.", "IMO your ex doesn't know why, and she was kind of unaware that your daughter was avoiding her calls (\"how many times have you lied to me\").\n\nTeenagers can be extremely inconsiderate in those matters, so it's unlikely she has communicated with her mom why she doesn't want to talk to her.  You can facilitate that by letting your ex know, \"hey, what's going on between you and (daughter)\" or asking your daughter why she's screening her mom's calls.\n\nYou need to realize that you're not an innocent bystander here.  You're your daughter's father and her mother's ex.  You can respect your daughter's boundaries and your ex's needs but you have to provide some guidance to your daughter on conflict resolution.", "Perhaps ask your daughter what her mother did so she doesn't wants to talk to her anymore?\n\nShouldn't you be interested in these kind of things as a parent?", "but if her only link to her daughter is through you, and you wont mediate, she has zero chance of finding out. Its also ridiculous and shitty communication to say \"figure out what you did wrong yourself\" instead of being clean in comms. Youre a bad parent OP, and need to think about the values you teach your daughter.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from. But you need to work out why your daughter doesn\u2019t as well. She needs to know because it impacts her, you need to know because it impacts your child.", "a 14-year-old can be honest about it, especially when that parent is not faced directly,\n\nthat conversation is coming that kid's way, latest when she has to be at her mother's.", "But OP lying for the daughter is wrong. Teaching the kid to lie is wrong.", "Usually when my daughter stops talking to me I know exactly why so I find it hard to believe my ex doesn't know what she had done", "And knowing that could change how you want to deal with it. Maybe letting her shut out her mom is the right choice, or maybe it\u2019s something they can and should try to work through, but need some guidance to get there.", "Yeah, but your daughter lives with you, right?  It's easier to suss out those \"I fucked up\" moments when you have constant contact with someone.  In either case, it's best not to assume, and whether your daughter likes it or not, she will always have to deal with conflict and she may or may not be able to avoid it.  And you won't always be able to enable/shield her from it.\n\nIt sounds like you don't know what the reason is either, correct?  I think a conversation with your daughter is the place to start.  Simply trying to put the conflict into words is very powerful.  Unless I'm missing a huge part of what is actually going on, she is learning to avoid conflict through lies, not resolve it.  It's up to you as the parent to help her realize the power of her convictions and the strength of healthy boundaries.  \n\nThe key point is that she's not learning boundaries by pretending to be \"unavailable\" when her mother calls.  She's learning to avoid discomfort at all costs, because setting boundaries is not comfortable.", "And I'm not saying you're in the wrong here, because you are respecting your daughter's decision.  However, I do think you have a responsibility to turn this into a learning experience, because she is still learning how to navigate the world and growing into an adult.  You have the opportunity to do both :)", "You live with your daughter.", "But you live with her. You see her daily. Your ex doesn't!", "Also, people are allowed to cool down, but you probably need to teach your daughter that the silent treatment isn't an appropriate conflict resolution method for the sake of her future relationships. It sounds like it's her default."]}
