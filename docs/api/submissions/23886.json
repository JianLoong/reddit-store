She was your mother\u2019s guest and your mother should replace the food.", "Nta. Since I am sure moving out is not an option right now I would do this go on fb marketplace and buy a mini fridge for cheap. Put it in your room and add a lock to it so they can't get into it. Keep your food in that. You can also get a locking cabinet for dry food.", "NTA it's your stuff and no one should take it without permission. Just one thing, lunchables are not cheap, it's like $0.45 worth of food for $2.00-$3.00", "NTA yes she is 1 but no she can\u2019t have what ever she wants in anyone\u2019s house. Because then your teaching your child to grow up entitled, spoiled and demanding.", "NTA because your family seems extremely entitled.", "NTA\n\nThat was your lunch and they should have asked if it was okay to take it. I certainly don't have the attitude that I can raid the fridge of any house I enter. What is wrong with some people?", "NTa. That\u2019s a really messed up mindset that they\u2019re creating for their child - \u201cwhatever house she\u2019s in everything is hers\u201d that\u2019s going to create an incredibly entitled and spoiled child", "NTA, I get it. I'm in the same boat with stomach issues.  It's upsetting to finally feel like eating and have the only thing you can eat in a kitchen FULL of food gone.  I am more financially stable though, and the people around me listen when I let them know.  My tongue tends to be VERY sharp when I'm hangry. They call me the Eviscerator.\n\nSo, the 1-year-old was hungry, and Mom and Grandma were too LAZY to prepare something for the kid.  I'm petty, I would teach the 1-year-old a sing-song: Momma and Grandma sitting in the kitchen L-A-Z-Y.  Look how their bottoms get big, but their brains get small. L-A-Z-Y.\n\nLaughing at you though is just a complete AH move!  The Lunchables are only $2-3, but charge them $10 for the convenience fee.  You will have to use your gas, and time to pick up a new one before class, so it seems fair.  If all they have is $20, then thank them for the tip.", "1yo can have anything, eh? That kid will be a spoiled nightmare to deal with. Is parenting like this how kleptomania develops? \n\nWould they also give her medicine, let's say your medicine you need to live if you have any, if it looks like candy when baby wants candy?\n\nNTA", "NTA.  I would ask them to go to the store right then and get me a replacement.  I would also tell them to get a couple more so we can have extra for next time your niece is here.", "Perhaps just have them pay you back?", "Your niece would not have known about the lunchable if they had not offered it btw.\n\nNTA Can you get on food stamps or visit a food bank maybe?", "NTA, I would have been so upset too. As someone who is also money tight most months I totally understand where you're coming from especially since you have a dietary restriction.", "NTA. Being an infant does not mean that \u201cwhatever house she\u2019s in, everything is hers.\u201d That\u2019s how we end up with adults that throw tantrums. They owe you a lunchable, and an apology. ESPECIALLY your mom. Who laughs and mocks their kid for being upset when their food gets taken? Next time your niece comes over, offer her something your mom was REALLY looking forward to, like a piece of cake or something from her favorite bakery. THEN we\u2019ll see if everything belongs to the baby!", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re definitely not the asshole. As a one year old, it probably does feel like everything is hers but that\u2019s why parents are supposed to say \u201cno that\u2019s auntie\u2019s, but you can have this snack she offered instead\u201d.\n\nAlso like someone else said, lunchables really aren\u2019t that cheap. I used to just make my own lunchable type meals for lunches (because I don\u2019t eat much) with some pepperoni, crackers, and cheese. I don\u2019t know if the pepperoni would be too much for your stomach issues but you could always cut up some turkey or ham slices. It would be a little more expensive all at once, but you\u2019d have lots of days worth of stuff. And if you\u2019re worried about not using all the stuff up in time, lunch meats and cheeses freeze fairly well so you could always use half at a time! \n\nI hope everything gets better for you with money and everything!", "Their argument was she's 1 and whatever house she's in, everything is hers.
