I (26M) previously work as a construction laborer,  fish filleter in a canning industry, and a food delivery rider since I was 18. I really love these jobs as I don't have many problems trying to fit in with people I work with and it has something to do with working with people having the same class as me. I graduated college at 26,  just recently since everything was online  it was easier for me to balance work as a delivery rider and as a college student. I did graduated late because I have two younger siblings and an ill father who needs his eldest son to be responsible at the age of 18. I have no issues with that, in fact, I really love working. \n\nI got hired in a law firm/industry two weeks ago. The first day I started, I wore a white polo and my black rubber shoes. It was my first time working in an office with cubicles and with people wearing really formal attire.  HR didn't notice anything wrong with my attire though so I thought everything was okay. I have my own cubicle and I love it! I have privacy. Now there are these two guys probably the same age went at my cubicle and introduced themselves and I was really appreciative of that gesture. As I stood up to talk with them, this one guy literally shouted while pointing at my shoes, \"what are those?\", and this other guy repeated the same thing the first guy said. I was confusedly laughing because I thought they were bantering but it turned out to be the other way. It happened the next day, and the following day as well where they also tease me wearing a maroon pants. At this point, I was confused and insecure. I started hating every minute working in this because other person would also laugh at their teases at me. I tried switching up, use my dad's old working shoes but it was huge. He was size 11 and I was 8.5 but i didnt care because i only wanted these guys to shut up about it. What a surprise, they still made a joke about looking like a clown. These guys are straight up bullies, WORK BULLIES at this point. I went to the HR, spoke to the person who brief me the first day, the only thing she said was \"You should get new shoes, and dont wear the same polo everyday\". At this point, im about to consider going back to delivery job. I'm so emotionally drained after what the HR personnel told me.\n\nYesterday was my 13th day at work, I wore my black rubber shoes and white polo, the same thing I wore my first day. There was a little incident with another workmate where she spilled coffee on her loafers. Now she was upset and worried, these two guys got her loafers that were soaked in coffee, slid it to me on the floor and ask me to wear it to get it dry fast. I had enough at this point and said, \"SURE\", while i removed my rubber shoes and threw it at this guy's desk which made a loud thumping sound that got attention from everyone. \n\nI'm sorry because this story was so personal and emotionally wrecking to me.

If you had a problem, you should've just talk to them first about then go to HR. \n\nSince this is a law firm environment, is there a reason you don't wear a suit or does your job allow you to wear what you want at the law firm?", "NTA (but you really should not have responded the way you did, I'm sorry. It's not fair, but your actions still weren't appropriate for a work place. I'm going with NTA instead of E S H because these coworkers are continually harassing you and 'morally justified' is NOT the same as 'appropriate for a work environment.'  Were you probably morally justified in throwing the shoe? I would say yes, since these guys decided to act like pre-schoolers, BUT, your actions were not \\*appropriate\\* and are liable to blow back on you.\n\nThat said, I'm sorry OP you really do need to invest in some more appropriate work attire.  Whether its 'fair' or not, if you work in a white collar job the expectation is that you 'represent' the company at work, and that means at least business casual (slacks in black, grey, navy, or tan. MAYBE a dark green but seriously the more boring the better).\n\nPolo shirts also really aren't okay. The good news is that men's button down shirts are not difficult to find at thrift stores! Again, get boring colors (preferably not white though, because white will show every little bit of dirt/stain). Stick with blues/greys/dark greens/ neutral colors. unless all the other men in the office are wearing ties, I would say you can skip the tie, just make sure your shirts aren't wrinkled.\n\nAnd yes, please buy some more appropriate shoes. Again, you don't have to break the bank! used leather men's dress shoes are not horribly difficult to find and with a little saddle soap and some neatsfoot oil they will look perfectly fine.\n\nA guy in white collar work should also have one black belt and one brown belt. Black belt = your black/grey slacks. Brown belt = your tan or navy slacks. (if you can't afford both that's totally understandable. get the black one first).\n\nIf you dont want to keep working in that environment that is absolutely valid! No one should feel attacked at work. But it seems like you're very qualified and a hard worker. To quote legally blonde, \"It would be a shame to let one (2) little pricks ruin your whole career\"\n\nFair or not, appearances matter in white collar work, and the shitty truth is as long as you don't \\*look\\* the part, you're probably going to continue to get judged/get pushback even from people who \\*arent'\\* as big of AHs as these particular coworkers.\n\nGood luck OP, you got this!\n\neta: grammar and justified NTA instead of e s h", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I sobbed in the bathroom every day at lunch hour until I quit about two weeks later. \n\nThere was actually one paralegal that worked there that apparently always took some candy out of dishes they had on their desk. she was a paralegal, they only secretaries, but she was kinda frumpy and dressed  like an old lady.  they always made fun of her. One day they decided to teach her a lesson and they put dog treats in the bowl.  apparently she grabbed some and started eating.  this was 40 yrs ago so i don\u2019t remember how it played out but i do remember how bad i felt for her\n\ni guess my point is you may never feel at home there.  you are NTA for your reaction but hopefully you can find something that suits you better. in the meantime if you have some spare cash, go to an outlet store and maybe buy some new shirts and shoes.  you\u2019ll need them for a new job anyway and it\u2019ll boost your self confidence", "ESH. Your coworkers are acting like school yard bullies and the way they are treating you is wrong. But like most bullies I doubt buying new shoes will make them behave better. Throwing your shoes at them is not okay and could have resulted in you getting fired. I understand that professional work attire is expensive but it does sound like you are underdressing at work. I would recommend checking out eBay, goodwill online or other second hand shops, my husband had a similar issue a few years ago and second hand stores helped build up his wardrobe at a fraction of the cost. I've worked at a few different professional jobs with some being better environments then others, if this particular job is not the right fit doesn't mean all similar jobs won't be a good fit. If you want to go back to delivery driving that's fine but please don't feel like you are lower class and you will never find your place in any professional settings.", "ETA yes these guys are total jerks. You still should not have thrown ANYTHING in response to them.", "Esh the guys are d!cks but u can\u2019t throw stuff at them, even if they deserve it. Look at what others are wearing. Go to goodwill and get yourself some professional shoes and clothes. It\u2019s an expected part of working in a law firm. Ignore the guys, they suck.", "Listen, this sounds rough, and they should not be bullying you AT ALL. But you have made a couple big mistakes here. What are other people wearing? When HR mentioned the clothing issue to you, did you consider getting some new items that are more in line with what other people are wearing?\nIf money is the issue, you can go to a thrift store and get a new pair of dress shoes and 5 shirts for about $20. If you need help picking things out online, I can help you!\nThrowing things at work is never the right response. Ever.", "NTA. Your new colleagues are being unprofessional and extremely rude. A decent coworker would take you aside one-on-one and offer you some *friendly* advice if your clothes aren\u2019t appropriate for the office or violate the dress code. If you have a supervisor, talk to him or her about the situation. Don\u2019t quit this job if it pays more than other jobs or will start you on a promising post-college career path. \n\nBut keep in mind that most offices do have dress codes and dress standards - often with some leeway. Find out what it is. If a dress code isn\u2019t formalized in writing or isn\u2019t clear, then take visual cues from the type of clothing your coworkers wear. Maybe you just need some oxford long-sleeve button-front shirts, khakis, and one or two decent pairs of shoes. If money is tight, save money by buying through eBay, discount sites, or at consignment shops. Good luck.", "I can wear a polo and tie but they are trying so hard to make fun of it. Call me out for repetitively wearing the same thing. I don't own a lot of thse clothings because I never had the chance to purchase it. It just sucks.", "Thank you so much. It's really rough. I appreciate you a lot.", "Ill save for new attire but i can only buy piece by piece because I'm also a breadwinner trying to achieve dreams as well.", "I do understand. I have never owned anything new or decent the past few years because I opted to pay education and necessities. I will be numb for few days until I get paid and decide if staying is still worth it.", "It is really rough. I will get paid after 30/31 days, for now accept the bullying I get until I can buy a pair of shoes.", "You are wearing a polo shirt and tie together?", "Ignore them. You're taking the bait every time which just emboldens bullies...Obviously HR is  useless so wear what you want and just keep working while ignoring their button pushing.\n\nRemember bullies are cowards, deeply insecure which is why they are trying to upset you. Never let them see that you are upset. It may take practice but it's way better than throwing shoes...", "Do what\u2019s right for you. I\u2019m sorry people can suck so much.", "You need more than just new shoes. You can also calmly ask your coworkers to please stop commenting on your shoes.", "I will probably prioritize working shoes first. That's all i could purchase after Ill get paid. I already did, Ma'am / Sir. I already did that for how many days to stop but it won't stop. They also made fun on my printed polo because it has floral design. Thats all I have. They are so immature.", "Have you tried looking at thrift/charity shops for work clothes? If what you have currently isn't enough or not the right stuff.", "If you are literally wearing the same shirt every day, I would prioritize the shirts"]}
