Enough said. Also I was curious to see if chatgpt could answer so I put your post into chatgpt and this was it's response. \r  \nIn your situation, it's understandable why you would feel conflicted. The key issue here seems to be boundaries and communication. As a self-employed individual working from home, your time is as valuable and constrained as anyone working in a traditional office setting. Your friends, including Claire, should respect your work hours and personal space.  \n**Setting Boundaries:** It's crucial for everyone, especially for those who work from home, to set clear boundaries with friends and family about work hours and personal time. It sounds like you've communicated your need for advance notice before visits, which is a reasonable request.  \n**Respecting Work Commitments:** Black Friday is a significant day for many businesses, and it's understandable that you would be particularly busy. Your reaction to Claire's unannounced visit during such a critical time seems to stem from the pressure of work commitments and a lack of sleep, rather than an intention to be rude.  \n**Handling the Situation:** Perhaps the situation could have been handled with more tact, but under stress and sleep deprivation, it's understandable that you were more direct than usual.  \n**Claire's Response and Subsequent Group Reaction:** It's regrettable that Claire felt hurt and that it led to a negative reaction among your friend group. However, it's important for friends to try to understand each other's circumstances and limitations.  \n**Reflecting on Your Actions and Their Perceptions:** While you might not be an \"asshole,\" reflecting on how your actions were perceived and finding a way to communicate your boundaries in a clear but respectful manner could be beneficial. It might help to have a conversation with Claire and your other friends to explain your situation and reiterate your need for boundaries regarding work time.  \n**Feeling Doubt and Seeking Resolution:** It's natural to doubt yourself when faced with criticism, especially from a group. However, standing by your needs and boundaries is not inherently wrong. It might be helpful to seek a resolution that acknowledges your friends' feelings while also making your own needs and limitations clear.  \nIn summary, you're not necessarily the \"bad guy\" in this situation. You have legitimate reasons for your actions, but there might be room for improved communication and understanding on both sides.", "YTA.

I get that some people have an open house and love drop in visitors.  But that is not a societal norm that everyone is required to meet.   Frankly I think everyone should always ask before coming but even if you are going to drop in unannounced then it's extraordinarily rude to not immediately and very apologetically leave when it's clear it's not a good time.   Absolutely NTA. \nThe only thing I can think of is that maybe your friend is having a difficult time - having a baby is bloody hard work and can really mess you up emotionally.

They were faster than the police because the streets around here aren't made for good car accesibility or driving fast, so calling the police turned out to be useless and installing real cameras could have gotten us in trouble and we may not use the footage in court so turning off the doorbell was the easiest course for me.
