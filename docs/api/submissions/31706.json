I recommend you make a sign for the outside of your front door that says something along the lines of, \"I'm working.  Do not disturb.\"\n\nBlock all of those \"friends\" and set up a Do Not Disturb for when you're working.  \n\nAlso, pick better people to be around.  You aren't their free coffee hangout.  Even SAHP can find ways to relax and entertain themselves without infringing on others.", "ESH.\n\nClaire, for repeatedly dropping by unannounced, despite your requests to not do so\n\nYou, for repeatedly answering the door or even letting her in; you\u2019re sending the signal that it\u2019s ok. This is why she thinks you\u2019re not serious. \n\nQuit answering the door and establish a firm boundary.", "NTA. Nobody should be stopping by unannounced. I don\u2019t even let my parents do that", "NTA.  You established a reasonable boundary.  (Don\u2019t drop by unannounced.) You have a reasonable explanation for establishing the boundary:  you work from home and don\u2019t necessarily have the time to socialize spur of the moment.  You enforced the boundary.  (Friend showed up unannounced and you turned her away.) Your \u201cfriend\u201d isn\u2019t much of a friend if she cannot be bothered to respect a reasonable boundary.", "Absolutely NTA.

My sister lives just off the high street in the student quarter (basically near a load of shops, where I go to run my errands) if I'm going to be in the area I text in the morning, \"hey I'm gonna be over on (street) today, lmk if you're free for a coffee!\"\n\nIf I don't hear back, I don't drop round. (Not to say she often ignores messages, but she's got 3 kids uner 12, I get she sometimes forgets or doesnt have time to reply.) It's really not hard to respect people's wishes and personal space!", "NTA\n\nI WFH, unless it is a delivery I do not open the door to anyone during work hours. I cannot afford to take my eyes off the ball and if I miss something our clients will invoke penalty clauses.\n\nI suggest you do the same", "NTA. If you're told people in advance not to come over, and they still do it, they are in the wrong.", " Nta. With friends like that who needs enemies am I right? Sounds like she did you a favor, gotta love when the trash takes itself out.", "If I decided to drop in unannounced my friend who's at work and busy, I'd be the AH.\n\nWhat difference does it make whether its an office, shipyard or your home. You're working to make money, no one should interrupt that!\n\nNTA and man is your 'friend' an entitled AH.", "NTA, in any way shape or form.\n\nI'm the type of person who doesnt mind dropping in at friends houses if I nearby, if they're home cool, if not cool, if they're busy, cool, I didnt give them any notice, and if they ask me to message first next time, I respect that.\n\nYour \"friend\" however has repeatedly violated your boundaries which you've let her know about on numerous occasions, and not only that but when you held true to stated boundaries, she ran her mouth to other people? This girl has zero respect for you. She's not a friend and it seems like she just revealed she's not worthy of even acquaintance status either.", "Nta it sounds like you have maybe out grown your friends? I would start cutting off the ones who feel comfortable shit talking you, especially on a public form", "NTA, but this shouldn't have gotten to this point.  One of 2 things went south.  Your request is hardly unusual; in fact, in my world it's the norm.  So the communication shouldn't have been difficult, because there's many ways to state it politely, but firmly.  The first time she did this, clearly it needed to be reinforced.\n\nThe other option is you have dumb friends.  Seriously.  If they all think you're the bad guy.....", "YANTA Claire seems to think she can do as she pleases and does not give a shit what you think or that what you told her doesn\u2019t apply to her. You did the right thing when she came over unannounced. So she makes a big drama out of it and tells people BS. Tell Claire to F off. Then when you get the chance, tell the story on FB and walk away. Of course misery loves company so if and so called friends join in her misery then so be it.", "Sounds like you just have bad friends. Someone with brainpower would not have any problems understanding that you are working and wouldn\u2019t come over. \n\nPlus the typical \u201ceveryone is on social media bitching about me now\u201d.

That\u2019s really thing?\n\nIf my doorbell rings and I\u2019m not explicitly expecting someone, I don\u2019t answer it.

Anyone with common sense won't just pop by when you've said to not do just that. Claire is the AH here.", "NTA.  She has zero respect for you.  That should be enough for you to understand.  And it sounds like that also extents to your other 'friends' as well.", "NTA.\n\nAnd coming over unannounced is the height of rudeness. I wonder what could be going on with your friends that none of them seem to realize this. You are not obligated to let anyone in if they come over unannounced. If they don't call or text first, how are they to know that you'll be even able to receive visitors? You could be working to meet a deadline, for instance, and even having to answer the door to tell them you can't see them now is a demand on your time you don't need.\n\nAnd if your friend does not take the hint on those occasions that she does overstay her welcome, there is also nothing wrong with informing them that you need to get back to work, and that you must ask them to go.", "NTA. For one you're allowed to decide whether or not you have time for visitors and secondly your home is also a place of business so your friend should definitely respect that. If your friend feels she wasted a trip that's 100% on her.", "NTA\n\nBeing 100% entitled she spins it to make her seem like the victim, but she showed up unannounced and demanded that you stop your job and stop earning money because she wants you to amuse her.", "NTA. Always remember\u2026 the person setting boundaries is always wrong, the person crossing the boundaries is always right. \ud83d\ude44", "100% NTA. Anyone who says otherwise is.", ">..if she bothered to text me asking if she could come.\n\nIn this day and age, who doesn't at least text \"Hey I'm a block away, want to have coffee\" or something instead of showing up at a friend's door?\n\nNTA obviously, but you're working at home or sleeping or whatever, why even answer the door in the first place to have this argument? I honestly don't know anyone who just opens their door any time the bell rings or someone knocks.  And get a doorbell cam!", "NTA, a simple post that\u2019s says: \u201cwhile I enjoy company and love my friends, I have consistently asked that they all respect my personal boundaries and not show up at my house unannounced and stay for hours on end and multiple days a week. While it may be convenient for some, not only is it inconvenient for me, it\u2019s out right rude and disrespectful to show up at someone\u2019s home (especially during their work hours) and expect you to be a gracious host. This is not the first, second or even the THIRD time I\u2019ve communicated to \u201cfriend\u201d that I do not like nor want unannounced visits to my home. If you are personally ok with that, I would ask that you provide \u201cfriend\u201d with an open invite to you home.\u201d", "NTA, my reply on FB would have been, real/true friends check before just dropping by during one's busy season or when working from home.", "**NTA**\n\nYou told your friends not to come by unannounced.\n\n> I told my friends to not do that and most of them actually listened or limited their visits...

You have a home-based business--your income source! \n\nSurely Claire is capable of making a simple text message to you?\n\nShe's pathetic.", "Ok and what if you're expecting mail? Literally have to answer the door sometimes.", "How does answering the door make her suck?
