Grant has a portion of lasagna that was as small as his fist,  which is the usual metric we use for his portion sizes to make sure we aren't giving him more than he can handle. He took a few bites of salad and literally 2 bites of lasagna, and then said he was full.\n\nLike every kid, we struggle with getting Grant to finish his plate, so over time we've tried a lot of different strategies to get him to eat, or to figure out why he doesn't want to. He's 10, not 2, so he's at an age where he is capable of articulating his feelings, wants, and needs. Sometimes if he doesn't like a food, he will say he is full because he doesn't want to eat the rest. So we asked him if he was really full, or if he didn't like the lasagna. Grant said he was full. We asked if he would like something else, like pizza rolls or a PB&J. Again, he said he was full.\n\nHe has a tendency to say he is full, then ask for junk food 20 minutes later. So when we took his unfinished plate away, we reminded him that since he didn't finish dinner, he doesn't get to have dessert or junk snacks, but if he is hungry later, we are happy to make him the food options we listed earlier, or have a healthier snack like a granola bar or veggies and dip. And if he finished a healthy snack, then we will consider some dessert type stuff. We don't want to deny him food if he is hungry, but also don't want him to load up on sugar closer to bedtime. We made sure he made eye contact and understood what we were telling him.\n\nIt gets to be around 8:30pm and Michael and Grant are in the living room playing Xbox together, so I slip away to have a couple bites of ice cream by myself in the kitchen. Well Grant got up and came into the kitchen to grab a snack from his snack station (it has granola bars, little bags of chips, fruit snacks, etc.), and he saw me. Immediately asked if he could have some ice cream and when I reminded him of what we discussed earlier, he burst into tears. Now Michael is saying that I was inconsiderate of Grant's feelings by \"waving the ice cream in his face\" and that I should have taken it into our bedroom so he wouldn't have seen it at all.\n\nIf I was the AH in this, it would be because I ate dessert when Grant wasn't allowed to have any. But I wasn't blatant about it, and I am an adult who deserves to eat what I want in my house. Grant had a long list of options to choose from if he was still hungry, and he understands that dessert is a reward.", "created_utc": 1675567151, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tzkvs/aita_for_eating_ice_cream_when_my_stepson_wasnt/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Grant said he wasn't hungry and was aware that he wouldn't be allowed ice cream after barely touching his dinner.  10 is way too old to be crying over not being allowed ice cream, especially after not eating his dinner and insisting that he wasn't hungry. Also, you didn't wave the ice cream in his face, you were eating it in a different room.", "NTA\n\nSometimes, being a proper parent sucks. Grant knew icecream wasn't allowed. Tears are a pretty typical reaction at that age, especially in the seeing ice cream when you aren't allowed ice cream situation.\n\nAlso, your husband is the AH. You were in another room enjoying dessert. Kids just effing know when the junk food comes out and they find it. I could almost guarantee, if you had gone to your bedroom he would have found you there.

It's not your fault he walked in and saw, and you shouldn't be expected to go eat in hiding.", "NTA, and your husband should have backed you up. You\u2019re allowed to have ice cream in your own house, and Grant could have had some too if he finished his dinner.", "Nta for the reasons you stated.", "NTA\n\nHe knew the consequences of not eating supper & was offered other healthy alternatives.

Your husband seems to be undermining his own decisions about your son's eating habits.", "NTA. The child's reaction was unfortunate, but you and your husband shouldn't have to hide your food. The offer remains the same: eat your dinner, or something healthy, and you can have dessert. Until then, no dessert. \n\nGrant is in what... 4th grade? 5th grade? He's old enough to understand this. \n\nI wonder if the presence of the snack station is part of the problem. Knowing he can \"graze\" junk food any time he wants isn't going to help with the dinner situation.", "NTA your partner is ridiculous expecting you to eat in the bedroom. The kid is 10 he's old enough to know that just because someone has something doesn't mean he gets to have it to.", "NTA. Sometimes parents have to be the \u201cbad guy\u201d in order to teach their kids good nutrition habits! If I may, your son is at an age that he may be more inclined to eat foods he helps make. Get him involved in food choices so he feels like he has some autonomy over what goes in his body. Also, maybe it would be helpful if he helped you prep these foods. Just some suggestions. Good luck", "NTA. Just normal parenting. You were clear with consequences and communicated healthy options if he was still hungry.", "NTA but your husband is the AH. It is ridiculous that he is mad at you. Why should you hide in the bedroom when you finished your dinner. No adult should have to hide from a kid because they are being punished. At the end of the day, he\u2019s 10 not 2.", "NTA. It sounds like you're trying to instill some healthy eating habits without just outlawing all sweets, etc. You weren't \"waving it in his face\" at all, and he could have had ice cream if he'd eaten a healthy meal.", "NTA. And you were literally trying to hide to eat it.  You could\u2019ve eaten this out in the open right next to him and you\u2019d still be NTA. He\u2019s a decent age and surely understands consequences. You\u2019re trying to set healthy boundaries with food which is fine. He made his own choice to not eat his meal and understands that means no meal. You\u2019re NTA for following through that. \n\nHeck, I do the same thing with my young (3&5) kids and it doesn\u2019t even result in a tantrum. One is getting ice cream because they ate healthy food and the other was \u201cfull\u201d? Perfectly fair. The one without usually quickly changes their tune, eats their age-appropriate meal, then can have a treat.", "NTA. You ate your dinner you get your dessert.

He's old enough.", "NTA\n\nActually you were more than reasonable about this. If he is too full for dinner or healthy snacks then he's too full for ice\ncream.

Y'all sound like good parents overall.", "NTA", "Most granola bars, \"fruit snacks\" and chips are even more unhealthy than ice cream, btw. Your rules don't have much to do with nutrition.", "NTA!!!! You are your dinner and deserve to have ice cream especially since your an adult in your own home. You laid out the expectations for Grant pretty clearly. Stick to your guns. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  This is basic parenting.", "NTA. You ate your dinner.", "NTA. Offer him a nutritious meal, let him eat or not eat as he pleases, then nothing more until the next meal. If he wants a snack you offer him leftovers. Forcing him to eat will give him hang ups about food.", "Isnt there an episode of Super Nanny or some other british child rearing show that outlines exactly WHY a childs eating behaviors should never dictate where and when other do or dont get desert?", "NTA so much. Also, you're taking a gentle, fair and overly reasonable approach to the whole eating situation as it is and that makes you even more NTA. As a parent with picky kids who will try all sorts of shenanigans to avoid eating, I applaud you.\n\nEdit: I should also mention that we've been very careful not to use dessert as a reward; it is a thing that we do rarely and not regularly. This has kept our kids from skipping dinner in an effort to hold out for dessert; if there's no 'payoff' to holding out, they seem more likely to eat what is given. Our strategy has been to try to have at least one part of the dinner that we know for sure they'll eat. That way, we know they'll eat at least one thing on the plate. Sometimes they'll suprise us and try the other stuff too. The less drama is made, the better it works.", "NTA.", "Nta not your problem", "I will say NTA you didn't grab the ice cream walk in front of him and started eating it you went to the KITCHEN which is in a DIFFERENT room because he was in the LIVING room at the time then he probably came in there to be nosey and do this exact thing !

Yeah, did I know ? Lol of course, did they catch on eventually but it worked the first 3-4 times easy.", "NTA. Sounds like you are doing the right things in regards to food. Kid just has to learn that sometimes other ppl get what he can\u2019t have. No one really likes that lesson.", "NTA insane he expected you to take it to the bedroom and hide just because you wanted some ice cream. That\u2019s unreasonable. You shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice everything without question just because your partner has a kid. It sounds like there are perfectly reasonable rules in place regarding his food, he\u2019ll get over it.", "Because I think it's important to say, I didn't keep shoving ice cream into my mouth while I reminded Grant of our discussion. As soon as he saw me with it, the ice cream went away. And I did apologize, not for eating it, but for upsetting him because I know he was frustrated.", "INFO: what time was dinner? / what time did he turn down all the food options?\n\nHow many hours/minutes was that before 8:30ish ice cream treat?", "NTA\n\nThe way you described handling food with him actually sounds really great", "NTA. but in general I wouldn\u2019t recommend the push to finish a plate. instead it might work better if you saved his portion for later, then when he asks for food say you have his leftover dinner, so if he wants something to eat he can eat that.", "NTA\n\nBut I have a nosy question. Does the full after two bites only happen with a certain type of food...\n Example, only when he's eating greens or only when he's eating pasta kind of thing? If so, he may have gas making him feel full.\n\nYou are doing excellent with your rules by the way. I'm not sure why your husband decided tonight was a good night to chastise you because his statement seems inappropriate. Children do need to learn they don't always get what they want just because someone else has a treat.", "YTA\n\nI had the exact same issues with my step daughter at that age.\n\nWhat I learned is that dessert is not a reward, that attitude creates bad eating habits and a bad relationship with food.  It puts extra focus on the dessert and it can motivate kids to overeat when they legitimately aren\u2019t hungry just so they can have dessert later.\n\nAlso, if I wanted dessert (which I do because I have a huge sweet tooth), I waited until after she went to bed.  Because I felt like a dick eating it in front of her and because I knew it would create resentment\n\nAre you entitled to eat dessert in the situation you described?  Yes, you are.  But it does also create bad dynamic with food in your house.", "Interesting you keep saying you want \"consistency\" in your comments yet for a child living a half life, as stepchildren usually do, there's no such thing.  There's constantly changing and fluctuating rules as the child goes through 2 houses.  YTA.  You could have taken your ice cream to your room but you want make sure you feel in control of your house and everyone in it.  It's about YOUR RULES.  Well, you made a kid cry.  You are the AH because you ate dessert with no intention of sharing, in a public space, when you had another option.  You didn't choose the option that was best for the kid, did you?  No you didn't.  You can come up with all sorts of justifications that sound great, and pure.  But when it comes down to it, YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE THE OPTION THAT WAS BEST FOR THE KID.  That is your authenticity.

I had siblings growing up and seeing the entire rest of the family enjoying dessert while you didn't get to reinforced the lesson. It's not like you were taunting him, you went to a different room to eat it. \n\nYour partner absolutely should have backed you up about this instead of telling you to eat it in hiding (p.s. don't teach kids that eating in the bedroom is OK). Kids learn from consistency between authority figures. Even worse, he rewarded his son's tantrum and, by extension, his unfinished meal by reprimanding you. What message is he trying to teach the kid? He needs to put on his parental pants and stop trying to be the friend parent/good guy by making you the bad guy parent. It's disrespectful to you and will foster resentment from your kid towards you. You both agreed to the rules, he needs to back you up when they're enforced.", "Nta you literally ate it in a different room. 10 is way to old to be pulling the 'I'm to full for dinner but not ice cream' routine and your partner knows this.", "How much food are y\u2019all putting on the plate because if it too much for him then giving him some of the ice cream like 2 scoops from a spoon wouldn\u2019t hurt and the left over food he didn\u2019t finish would be used as a breakfast choice in the morning for him to finish.", "NTA\n\nmy only thought is with \u201che\u2019s 10, not 2, so he\u2019s as an age where he is capable of articulating his feelings, wants, and needs\u201d. from this story (and of course as an outsider to your family), he maybe **should** be able to, but there seems to be some reason why he can\u2019t or won\u2019t. may be worth a pediatrician mention or a therapist figure to see if there is more of an underlying issue? maybe a mental block with foods or intolerance?", "NTA You're trying to be consistent and sensible about it.

I find I feel less bloated if I have it with a really basic salad and French dressing. When I say basic I mean iceberg and tomato, maybe a bit of cucumber. There's something about that combo that cuts through the bloatiness of just a plate of lasagna.\n\nHave you asked him if some foods make him filled than others?

Mostly it seems you're both setting him up with a terrible relationship to food, based on outdated info. Sugar doesn't wind kids up, for example. If you stop making food such a battleground issue, you'll probably find he eats much better.", "YTA. He's 10, surely you can just wait until he goes to bed? I don't know how long you've been a step-parent for, but if your new, it's always an AH move to eat something a child isn't allowed in front of them when instead you could just wait a little.\n\nIf it was the middle of the day I'd be more inclined to say maybe N-A-H. But really dude. Although, you really should not be using dessert as a reward. That's how you raise a kid to have eating issues 101. But I do really like the healthy snack bar idea, that's perfect for a kid that's having trouble eating everything.

In the past we have waited until the kiddo was in bed to eat our desserts. But dammit today I just wanted some ice cream!", "I agree. We have always told him he is allowed to dislike things and tell us when. I cook a lot of different kinds of meals and sometimes he loves them, sometimes he doesn't. And when he doesn't, we offer him alternatives. I gave him a lot of chances tonight and he didn't take them, so it was important he know that his choices have consequences.", "I give him a lot of passes on dramatic behavior because he has some issues that aren't being handled consistently between homes. Most nights, as soon as we get him tucked into bed he asked for a bedtime snack, because that's what his mom's side allows him to do. We do our best to establish a system that he understands and is able to agree to, but he still pushes it.", "My husband does struggle with wanting to be the \"fun dad.\" At his mom's, Grant has a lot less structure and very little one on one time with her because he has w younger siblings. We try our best to nuture his needs while also providing consistency and allowing him as much control over his life as possible.", "My husband talks himself out of things pretty constantly. I am not an iron fist demanding that things be a certain way. Parenting decisions always involve a discussion and we give each other opportunities to back out or change something. But once we decide, we try to stay consistent for Grant's sake. Michael just has trouble with wanting to be the \"fun dad.\"", "Usually we put the snack bowl away about halfway between lunch and dinner so he has time to digest and get hungry again, and then bring it back down for a little while after dinner in case he needs a little more to eat. Kids appetites can be so finnicky as they grow and we want him to feel like he is in control of his eating so he doesn't have to wait for us to make him something all the time.", "I love letting him help me cook! When he started showing an interest around 6 I encouraged it. His favorite meal to help with is breakfast, because he can scramble the eggs. This time with the lasagna it was a pre-made one that my gran gave me, and he does well with pasta dishes most of the time so I wasn't anticipating a problem. Ah well. Murphy's law I guess.", "Thank you. We try and it's not easy and we try really hard to adapt and change things up if they don't work.", "I mean I could give you a list of the brands of things I have in there. It's not just full of chewy bars and ruffles. I'm a pretty informed consumer when it comes to kid snacks, so I'm not loading the bo up with chewy bars and doritos.", "Dinner right at 7, finished up by about 7:30. We brought the snack bowl down around 8 in case he got peckish and made that known to him. I went into the kitchen at 8:30 to have literally a couple bites because I'm not one to make a huge bowl. I can admit to bad timing and probably could have waited longer.", "Man it's hard sometimes. We have had to change things up as he's gotten older and try to let him be more and more involved in the discussions and he feels like he has control over his life. For a long time he just would not communicate at all when he was hungry, and we would ask and ask just for him to say no. Then 5 minutes later, he would be sneaking into the kitchen to snag something off the counter. Setting up the snack station has been a huge relief and also very educational for us as his parents, because we can see when he gets hungry and how he regulates. The bowl comes down after breakfast and goes up a little while before dinner, then it's back down after dinner for a bit until bed time. Lunch is pretty free form at our house, and we usually just ask him around that time if he wants us to make him anything more substantial, or if he just wants to snack.", "Believe me we save the plates a lot, and it's more of a fight to get him to eat his leftovers than it is to get him to finish it when they're fresh.", "Good question. I haven't noticed a pattern with any certain types of food. I'm a pretty variable cook and sometimes he likes things, sometimes he doesn't. And I'm aware of how their appetites change as they grow, so more often than not I give him small portions with the chance for seconds than loading up his plate and demanding he eat all of it.", "You know I will keep this in mind in the future. My struggle as a child was always being served plates that were too full that I just couldn't finish, even if I liked the food. We try really hard to give him SMALL portions and when he finishes, we ask if he wants seconds or if he is ready for dessert. I guess reward is the wrong way to phrase it, and I will work on reframing how we have those discussions with Grant in the future.\n\nNow when it comes to me eating the ice cream, it is unhealthy to create the expectation that just because someone has something, that he gets to have it too.", "I'm a grazer myself and Grant goes through periods where he is too. It's why we keep dinner portions so small, like 3-4 bites of something at a time. And then it's \"do you want seconds or are you ready for dessert?\" Kids' appetites do crazy things when they are growing and sometimes he will put away a ton of food and other times he can't, but it's hard to tell whether he is really \"full\" or if he just doesn't WANT to eat any more because he doesn't like it.", "Wowwies. I'm going to guess you maybe don't have kids?\nIt isn't dessert as a reward. This is literally basic parenting so your kids have actual food in them prior to eating junk. Real food is a need. Ice cream is a want\nSecond - she literally says she snuck off while they wear in another room .. how is that waving that in the kids face\nAnd best for last of these parents doing things right - he has other real food options. Most families don't do that either due to cost or just honestly being strict. \nNTA to OP but people who judge like this always weird me out.", "I've been in the picture since he was 3, and my husband was young (22) when we met and I was getting a child psychology degree, so we helped each other learn how to be better parents. Unfortunately a lot of kids grow to believe that just because someone else has something, that they should have it to. He is not short on options, but he always wants the thing he doesn't have.", "That\u2019s a very different set of circumstances", "Unless he has something going on 10 is plenty old enough to understand consequences. If he gets that you can have ice cream and he can't then that may be the motivation he needs. If he never saw you eat any on the nights he couldn't he probably assumed you didn't. The idea that you can have it because you finished your dinner may be what convinces him. \n\nI do have to wonder about bursting into tears over ice cream. It's been a long time for me but that sounds like a younger kid's response. Are there other issues?\n\nNTA, however.", "Eat it in front of his young ass. he didn't eat his dinner, he gets no dessert, simple. He is not in charge.", "Maybe the kid wasnt hungry.\n\n>so it was important he know that his choices have consequences.\n\nThis makes it sound like you did it to prove a point and kinda be a dick about it.\n\nIts dinner, not armed robbery.", "Sounds like your partner needs a few lessons too - on understanding kids\u2019 psychology and on teaching kids good eating habits.\n\nNTA", "Having been through this, in retrospect I can not tell you enough to just give the kid a healthy snack.  It\u2019s what he\u2019s used to, it doesn\u2019t hurt anything and in 10 years you\u2019ll realize how much time and energy you wasted on something that didn\u2019t really matter.", "Sounds like you've got a pretty good handle on what's going on! I'd just like to share 2 little strategies that have helped us:\n1. A mostly-healthy bedtime snack is part of our regular bedtime routine. Having it planned every night prevents it from working as an extra delay tactic. (And in your case, it sounds like it would help keep things consistent with mom's house.) \n2. If our kids start drifting towards eating less & less at dinner but wanting more & more at snacktime, guess what they start getting offered for snack? Dinner leftovers! Calmly and cheerfully of course, because it's not a punishment; they just didn't happen to be hungry then, so we were thoughtful & saved their food for later. ;) They are usually a bit dismayed when it happens, but it generally only takes one night to 'reset' their appetites back to filling up on the meal like they're supposed to.", "\"Fun dad\" often means \"Mean Mom\" in a kid's mind.\n\nedit add\n \nAnd vice versa.", "Makes me smile knowing you guys cook together sometimes! That\u2019s great and definitely a bonding experience! Kids will be kids, hopefully he comes around sooner or later", "Another INFO:\n\nIf he\u2019d eaten more at dinner, could he have ice cream at 8:30pm? \n\n(You have comment about not wanting him loaded up on sugar before bed.)\n\nAlso what do you mean by dessert is a reward? A reward for what?", "Sounds like your husband was having an off night in his response and son was seeing if he could push a boundary just a little and the two collided with you in the middle. \n\nAnd it sounds like you are doing an excellent job of making sure he gets to try new foods and learn how to eat healthy.", "With difficult eaters, it\u2019s especially Important to establish a relationship of trust - especially that you trust that they will eat the amount of food they need, and they will try the foods that they are ready to enjoy.\n\nWhen you continuously ask and require different things, it shows you don\u2019t trust their own instincts and they will reactively push back on anything. They do this to ensure the expectations of them are not changed into something they are totally comfortable with. If they know they are trusted, they can feel safe when trying foods that they won\u2019t be forced to eat them if they didn\u2019t actually like it. \n\nLike the prior response - it\u2019s better to decide how often dessert will be available and serve it regardless of how the meal went.\n\nNo doubt you will go through a couple meals where the kid eats only bread. But in most cases once they understand it\u2019s really up to them what they eat, they quickly become a lot more open minded.\n\nIn summary - you decide what foods are served. They decide what and how much they eat.", ">Now when it comes to me eating the ice cream, it is unhealthy to create the expectation that just because someone has something, that he gets to have it too.\n\nIt\u2019s ice cream. In your house.  After dinner.  On a regular night.  It\u2019s not a life lesson.  you are creating an issue when there doesn\u2019t need to be one.  What you are doing isn\u2019t going to teach him anything other than to resent you.  Let it go.  \n\nYou want him to learn he can\u2019t have everything?  Then dont be the parent that buys him presents for other kids parties.  Have him donate old toys to charity.  Have him pick out a cool toy for Toys-for-Tots.  There are lots of ways to teach that lesson in a meaningful matter.  Eating ice cream in front of him ain\u2019t it.", "Kids always know lol. They say moms have eyes in the back of their head but kids have sonar hearing when it comes to that freezer door. Even if their out. Lol NTA your kid has the understanding of natural consequences. And you did offer him something else.", "The emotional outbursts are few and far between now that he's older, but sometimes things just set him off. Frustration seems to be the biggest trigger.", "It is less about proving a point than it is about consistency. We had a conversation before that he was involved in, understood, and agreed to. Then, when he tried to flip the script, I reminded him of what he agreed to, and he got frustrated that I wasn't bending.", "Yes to the first part, but it wasn't solely about the amount it was that he said he was \"full.\" Timing wise by 8:30 we would have allowed some ice cream, but we rarely if ever have had a night where he waits a full hour after dinner to ask for dessert.\n\nAnd I'm learning that reward is not the proper word to use, so I will be changing how I talk about dessert in the future. We want to make sure he has adequate amounts of actual food before we let him get into candy, cookies, ice cream, whatever.\n\nThis wasn't the first dinner he has eaten at our house and not the first time he's told us he is \"full\" and then asked for dessert as soon as he took his plate to the sink.", "OK, that makes sense. We all get overwhelmed. I was just concerned if there was a larger issue that hadn't been recognized. Again, if he doesn't see you eat the ice cream maybe he thinks it's just not an ice cream night. Now he knows that he is actually missing out because he didn't finish his dinner. \n\nThat may be the tipping point. And tell his dad that having to hide it from him is not the way to go. If he can't have it from a medical standpoint then that's just mean but he needs to learn that the privilege of ice cream is earned by eating a decent dinner.", "Probably cause he\u2019s hangry from skipping dinner!", "He\u2019s 10.\n\nIts ice cream.\n\nI get it, youre going to dig your heels in on this because you know you\u2019re right.  \n\nI did the same thing.  Now, 10 years later, I see how much energy and frustration I wasted.    \nIm not saying give the kid ice cream, just eat it after he goes to bed.  By eating the ice cream in front of him, you are making it a much bigger issue than it need be.  \nThis is not a hill worth dying on.  I promise you.", "It sounds like over an hour passed from when he said he was full to when he came for a snack. That\u2019s not super long, but it\u2019s not unrealistic that he felt full then & an hour later he wanted something to eat. \n\nAlso if he has a snack station with granola bars & fruit snacks that he can take freely (& eat as much as he wants), he has access to just as many (or more) calories & sugar as in the ice cream. \n\nIt\u2019s good that you give him alternative to other food & I think you have a point if he\u2019s coming back for treats 15-20 minutes later. But he came back an hour later. And he seems to have come with the intent of getting something out of his sanctioned snack station. It seems like he only asked for ice cream because he saw you having it. \n\nKids are going to get upset if they want food, they see someone having special/fun food & they aren\u2019t allowed to have it. \n\nI\u2019d be with you if you offered him a small amount (say 1/3rd cup, which is probably similar calories & sugar to a granola bar) & he threw a fit about not getting more. \n\nBut honestly, I think you kind of suck here.\n\nTo be clear it\u2019s not because you had ice cream. It\u2019s because of your illogical rules about what he can eat. (And maybe for being surprised about totally normal kid reactions.)\n\nIf you\u2019re going to have a weird arbitrary rule that he can\u2019t have ice cream/dessert (but he can have sugar/calories, other less healthy food in his snack station), it\u2019s probably best to wait until after he\u2019s asleep for you to get them out. It sounds like you have some really good behaviors about giving him options/not forcing him to eat at meals. But this seems a little nonsensical & with the potential to teach him some unhealthy habits (eating  more at dinner when he\u2019s already full so he can get the fun dessert later in case you\u2019re having it)."]}
