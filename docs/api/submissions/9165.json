Grant has a portion of lasagna that was as small as his fist,  which is the usual metric we use for his portion sizes to make sure we aren't giving him more than he can handle. He took a few bites of salad and literally 2 bites of lasagna, and then said he was full.\n\nLike every kid, we struggle with getting Grant to finish his plate, so over time we've tried a lot of different strategies to get him to eat, or to figure out why he doesn't want to. He's 10, not 2, so he's at an age where he is capable of articulating his feelings, wants, and needs. Sometimes if he doesn't like a food, he will say he is full because he doesn't want to eat the rest. So we asked him if he was really full, or if he didn't like the lasagna. Grant said he was full. We asked if he would like something else, like pizza rolls or a PB&J. Again, he said he was full.\n\nHe has a tendency to say he is full, then ask for junk food 20 minutes later. So when we took his unfinished plate away, we reminded him that since he didn't finish dinner, he doesn't get to have dessert or junk snacks, but if he is hungry later, we are happy to make him the food options we listed earlier, or have a healthier snack like a granola bar or veggies and dip. And if he finished a healthy snack, then we will consider some dessert type stuff. We don't want to deny him food if he is hungry, but also don't want him to load up on sugar closer to bedtime. We made sure he made eye contact and understood what we were telling him.\n\nIt gets to be around 8:30pm and Michael and Grant are in the living room playing Xbox together, so I slip away to have a couple bites of ice cream by myself in the kitchen. Well Grant got up and came into the kitchen to grab a snack from his snack station (it has granola bars, little bags of chips, fruit snacks, etc.), and he saw me. Immediately asked if he could have some ice cream and when I reminded him of what we discussed earlier, he burst into tears. Now Michael is saying that I was inconsiderate of Grant's feelings by \"waving the ice cream in his face\" and that I should have taken it into our bedroom so he wouldn't have seen it at all.\n\nIf I was the AH in this, it would be because I ate dessert when Grant wasn't allowed to have any. But I wasn't blatant about it, and I am an adult who deserves to eat what I want in my house.

Grant said he wasn't hungry and was aware that he wouldn't be allowed ice cream after barely touching his dinner.  10 is way too old to be crying over not being allowed ice cream, especially after not eating his dinner and insisting that he wasn't hungry. Also, you didn't wave the ice cream in his face, you were eating it in a different room.", "NTA\n\nSometimes, being a proper parent sucks. Grant knew icecream wasn't allowed. Tears are a pretty typical reaction at that age, especially in the seeing ice cream when you aren't allowed ice cream situation.\n\nAlso, your husband is the AH. You were in another room enjoying dessert. Kids just effing know when the junk food comes out and they find it. I could almost guarantee, if you had gone to your bedroom he would have found you there.

Your husband seems to be undermining his own decisions about your son's eating habits.", "NTA. The child's reaction was unfortunate, but you and your husband shouldn't have to hide your food. The offer remains the same: eat your dinner, or something healthy, and you can have dessert. Until then, no dessert. \n\nGrant is in what... 4th grade? 5th grade? He's old enough to understand this. \n\nI wonder if the presence of the snack station is part of the problem. Knowing he can \"graze\" junk food any time he wants isn't going to help with the dinner situation.", "NTA your partner is ridiculous expecting you to eat in the bedroom. The kid is 10 he's old enough to know that just because someone has something doesn't mean he gets to have it to.", "NTA. Sometimes parents have to be the \u201cbad guy\u201d in order to teach their kids good nutrition habits! If I may, your son is at an age that he may be more inclined to eat foods he helps make. Get him involved in food choices so he feels like he has some autonomy over what goes in his body. Also, maybe it would be helpful if he helped you prep these foods. Just some suggestions. Good luck", "NTA. Just normal parenting. You were clear with consequences and communicated healthy options if he was still hungry.", "NTA but your husband is the AH. It is ridiculous that he is mad at you. Why should you hide in the bedroom when you finished your dinner. No adult should have to hide from a kid because they are being punished. At the end of the day, he\u2019s 10 not 2.", "NTA. It sounds like you're trying to instill some healthy eating habits without just outlawing all sweets, etc. You weren't \"waving it in his face\" at all, and he could have had ice cream if he'd eaten a healthy meal.", "NTA. And you were literally trying to hide to eat it.  You could\u2019ve eaten this out in the open right next to him and you\u2019d still be NTA. He\u2019s a decent age and surely understands consequences. You\u2019re trying to set healthy boundaries with food which is fine. He made his own choice to not eat his meal and understands that means no meal. You\u2019re NTA for following through that. \n\nHeck, I do the same thing with my young (3&5) kids and it doesn\u2019t even result in a tantrum. One is getting ice cream because they ate healthy food and the other was \u201cfull\u201d? Perfectly fair. The one without usually quickly changes their tune, eats their age-appropriate meal, then can have a treat.", "NTA. You ate your dinner you get your dessert.

He's old enough.", "NTA\n\nActually you were more than reasonable about this. If he is too full for dinner or healthy snacks then he's too full for ice\ncream.

Y'all sound like good parents overall.", "NTA", "Most granola bars, \"fruit snacks\" and chips are even more unhealthy than ice cream, btw. Your rules don't have much to do with nutrition.", "NTA!!!! You are your dinner and deserve to have ice cream especially since your an adult in your own home. You laid out the expectations for Grant pretty clearly. Stick to your guns. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  This is basic parenting.", "NTA. You ate your dinner.", "NTA. Offer him a nutritious meal, let him eat or not eat as he pleases, then nothing more until the next meal. If he wants a snack you offer him leftovers. Forcing him to eat will give him hang ups about food.", "Isnt there an episode of Super Nanny or some other british child rearing show that outlines exactly WHY a childs eating behaviors should never dictate where and when other do or dont get desert?", "NTA so much. Also, you're taking a gentle, fair and overly reasonable approach to the whole eating situation as it is and that makes you even more NTA. As a parent with picky kids who will try all sorts of shenanigans to avoid eating, I applaud you.\n\nEdit: I should also mention that we've been very careful not to use dessert as a reward; it is a thing that we do rarely and not regularly. This has kept our kids from skipping dinner in an effort to hold out for dessert; if there's no 'payoff' to holding out, they seem more likely to eat what is given. Our strategy has been to try to have at least one part of the dinner that we know for sure they'll eat. That way, we know they'll eat at least one thing on the plate. Sometimes they'll suprise us and try the other stuff too. The less drama is made, the better it works.", "NTA.", "Nta not your problem", "I will say NTA you didn't grab the ice cream walk in front of him and started eating it you went to the KITCHEN which is in a DIFFERENT room because he was in the LIVING room at the time then he probably came in there to be nosey and do this exact thing !

Yeah, did I know ? Lol of course, did they catch on eventually but it worked the first 3-4 times easy.", "NTA. Sounds like you are doing the right things in regards to food. Kid just has to learn that sometimes other ppl get what he can\u2019t have. No one really likes that lesson.", "NTA insane he expected you to take it to the bedroom and hide just because you wanted some ice cream. That\u2019s unreasonable. You shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice everything without question just because your partner has a kid. It sounds like there are perfectly reasonable rules in place regarding his food, he\u2019ll get over it.", "Because I think it's important to say, I didn't keep shoving ice cream into my mouth while I reminded Grant of our discussion. As soon as he saw me with it, the ice cream went away. And I did apologize, not for eating it, but for upsetting him because I know he was frustrated.", "INFO: what time was dinner? / what time did he turn down all the food options?\n\nHow many hours/minutes was that before 8:30ish ice cream treat?", "NTA\n\nThe way you described handling food with him actually sounds really great", "NTA. but in general I wouldn\u2019t recommend the push to finish a plate. instead it might work better if you saved his portion for later, then when he asks for food say you have his leftover dinner, so if he wants something to eat he can eat that.", "NTA\n\nBut I have a nosy question. Does the full after two bites only happen with a certain type of food...\n Example, only when he's eating greens or only when he's eating pasta kind of thing? If so, he may have gas making him feel full.\n\nYou are doing excellent with your rules by the way. I'm not sure why your husband decided tonight was a good night to chastise you because his statement seems inappropriate. Children do need to learn they don't always get what they want just because someone else has a treat.", "YTA\n\nI had the exact same issues with my step daughter at that age.\n\nWhat I learned is that dessert is not a reward, that attitude creates bad eating habits and a bad relationship with food.  It puts extra focus on the dessert and it can motivate kids to overeat when they legitimately aren\u2019t hungry just so they can have dessert later.\n\nAlso, if I wanted dessert (which I do because I have a huge sweet tooth), I waited until after she went to bed.  Because I felt like a dick eating it in front of her and because I knew it would create resentment\n\nAre you entitled to eat dessert in the situation you described?  Yes, you are.  But it does also create bad dynamic with food in your house.", "Interesting you keep saying you want \"consistency\" in your comments yet for a child living a half life, as stepchildren usually do, there's no such thing.  There's constantly changing and fluctuating rules as the child goes through 2 houses.  YTA.  You could have taken your ice cream to your room but you want make sure you feel in control of your house and everyone in it.  It's about YOUR RULES.  Well, you made a kid cry.  You are the AH because you ate dessert with no intention of sharing, in a public space, when you had another option.  You didn't choose the option that was best for the kid, did you?  No you didn't.  You can come up with all sorts of justifications that sound great, and pure.  But when it comes down to it, YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE THE OPTION THAT WAS BEST FOR THE KID.  That is your authenticity.

Kids learn from consistency between authority figures. Even worse, he rewarded his son's tantrum and, by extension, his unfinished meal by reprimanding you. What message is he trying to teach the kid? He needs to put on his parental pants and stop trying to be the friend parent/good guy by making you the bad guy parent. It's disrespectful to you and will foster resentment from your kid towards you. You both agreed to the rules, he needs to back you up when they're enforced.", "Nta you literally ate it in a different room. 10 is way to old to be pulling the 'I'm to full for dinner but not ice cream' routine and your partner knows this.", "How much food are y\u2019all putting on the plate because if it too much for him then giving him some of the ice cream like 2 scoops from a spoon wouldn\u2019t hurt and the left over food he didn\u2019t finish would be used as a breakfast choice in the morning for him to finish.", "NTA\n\nmy only thought is with \u201che\u2019s 10, not 2, so he\u2019s as an age where he is capable of articulating his feelings, wants, and needs\u201d. from this story (and of course as an outsider to your family), he maybe **should** be able to, but there seems to be some reason why he can\u2019t or won\u2019t. may be worth a pediatrician mention or a therapist figure to see if there is more of an underlying issue? maybe a mental block with foods or intolerance?", "NTA You're trying to be consistent and sensible about it.

Mostly it seems you're both setting him up with a terrible relationship to food, based on outdated info. Sugar doesn't wind kids up, for example. If you stop making food such a battleground issue, you'll probably find he eats much better.", "YTA. He's 10, surely you can just wait until he goes to bed? I don't know how long you've been a step-parent for, but if your new, it's always an AH move to eat something a child isn't allowed in front of them when instead you could just wait a little.\n\nIf it was the middle of the day I'd be more inclined to say maybe N-A-H. But really dude. Although, you really should not be using dessert as a reward. That's how you raise a kid to have eating issues 101. But I do really like the healthy snack bar idea, that's perfect for a kid that's having trouble eating everything.

In the past we have waited until the kiddo was in bed to eat our desserts. But dammit today I just wanted some ice cream!", "I agree. We have always told him he is allowed to dislike things and tell us when. I cook a lot of different kinds of meals and sometimes he loves them, sometimes he doesn't. And when he doesn't, we offer him alternatives. I gave him a lot of chances tonight and he didn't take them, so it was important he know that his choices have consequences.", "I give him a lot of passes on dramatic behavior because he has some issues that aren't being handled consistently between homes. Most nights, as soon as we get him tucked into bed he asked for a bedtime snack, because that's what his mom's side allows him to do. We do our best to establish a system that he understands and is able to agree to, but he still pushes it.", "My husband does struggle with wanting to be the \"fun dad.\" At his mom's, Grant has a lot less structure and very little one on one time with her because he has w younger siblings. We try our best to nuture his needs while also providing consistency and allowing him as much control over his life as possible.", "My husband talks himself out of things pretty constantly. I am not an iron fist demanding that things be a certain way. Parenting decisions always involve a discussion and we give each other opportunities to back out or change something. But once we decide, we try to stay consistent for Grant's sake. Michael just has trouble with wanting to be the \"fun dad.\"", "Usually we put the snack bowl away about halfway between lunch and dinner so he has time to digest and get hungry again, and then bring it back down for a little while after dinner in case he needs a little more to eat. Kids appetites can be so finnicky as they grow and we want him to feel like he is in control of his eating so he doesn't have to wait for us to make him something all the time.", "I love letting him help me cook! When he started showing an interest around 6 I encouraged it. His favorite meal to help with is breakfast, because he can scramble the eggs. This time with the lasagna it was a pre-made one that my gran gave me, and he does well with pasta dishes most of the time so I wasn't anticipating a problem. Ah well. Murphy's law I guess.", "Thank you. We try and it's not easy and we try really hard to adapt and change things up if they don't work.", "I mean I could give you a list of the brands of things I have in there. It's not just full of chewy bars and ruffles. I'm a pretty informed consumer when it comes to kid snacks, so I'm not loading the bo up with chewy bars and doritos.", "Dinner right at 7, finished up by about 7:30. We brought the snack bowl down around 8 in case he got peckish and made that known to him. I went into the kitchen at 8:30 to have literally a couple bites because I'm not one to make a huge bowl. I can admit to bad timing and probably could have waited longer.", "Man it's hard sometimes. We have had to change things up as he's gotten older and try to let him be more and more involved in the discussions and he feels like he has control over his life. For a long time he just would not communicate at all when he was hungry, and we would ask and ask just for him to say no. Then 5 minutes later, he would be sneaking into the kitchen to snag something off the counter. Setting up the snack station has been a huge relief and also very educational for us as his parents, because we can see when he gets hungry and how he regulates. The bowl comes down after breakfast and goes up a little while before dinner, then it's back down after dinner for a bit until bed time. Lunch is pretty free form at our house, and we usually just ask him around that time if he wants us to make him anything more substantial, or if he just wants to snack.", "Believe me we save the plates a lot, and it's more of a fight to get him to eat his leftovers than it is to get him to finish it when they're fresh.", "Good question. I haven't noticed a pattern with any certain types of food. I'm a pretty variable cook and sometimes he likes things, sometimes he doesn't. And I'm aware of how their appetites change as they grow, so more often than not I give him small portions with the chance for seconds than loading up his plate and demanding he eat all of it.", "You know I will keep this in mind in the future. My struggle as a child was always being served plates that were too full that I just couldn't finish, even if I liked the food. We try really hard to give him SMALL portions and when he finishes, we ask if he wants seconds or if he is ready for dessert. I guess reward is the wrong way to phrase it, and I will work on reframing how we have those discussions with Grant in the future.\n\nNow when it comes to me eating the ice cream, it is unhealthy to create the expectation that just because someone has something, that he gets to have it too.", "I'm a grazer myself and Grant goes through periods where he is too. It's why we keep dinner portions so small, like 3-4 bites of something at a time. And then it's \"do you want seconds or are you ready for dessert?\" Kids' appetites do crazy things when they are growing and sometimes he will put away a ton of food and other times he can't, but it's hard to tell whether he is really \"full\" or if he just doesn't WANT to eat any more because he doesn't like it.", "Wowwies. I'm going to guess you maybe don't have kids?\nIt isn't dessert as a reward. This is literally basic parenting so your kids have actual food in them prior to eating junk. Real food is a need.

Your husband\u2019s rules are idiotic, but the best you can do is set a boundary that you\u2019re an adult and you\u2019re not going to hide food.

NTA", "I'm going to preface this by saying I fully understand that our (my family's) relationship to food is completely different from a lot of people's, but I thought I'd offer a different perspective. \n\nMy daughter is 10 and has a severe eating disorder. She cannot get herself to eat enough food to even survive and has a G Tube to give her more than half of her daily minimum calories. \n\nAll this started with our rigid views on what kids should be eating at mealtimes. If she didn't finish her dinner, she didn't get dessert. This made everything a lot worse, and I fully blame myself and wonder what would have happened if I want so strict about meals.  In all honesty, she probably would still be on a feeding tube right now, but still. \n\nNow, or rule is one bite. She has to have just one bite of everything on her plate to qualify for dessert. And \"one bite\" is loose. I just want her to taste it. We don't do \"healthy food and bad food\". Plus, ice cream has tons of calories. If I had given her salad and lasagna, she wouldn't have eaten that, but she could make up the calories with ice cream, so there's no way I'd turn her down if she asked for that. \n\nMy son doesn't have the same struggles, but he can also be a picky eater. So we focus on broadening his palate, not forcing his eating. After speaking to tons of professionals about the psychology of eating, attempting to force children to eat a full plate of food is never a good idea (unless your child has anorexia, and only then it should be done under professional guidance). Punishing then for not eating also rarely works. \n\nSo, in the end, even though I know this was about hiding when you eat ice cream, but the overall issue seems to be about using food as a reward or punishment. And from personal experience, plus what I've learned from professionals, this is not a good idea.", "NTA. \nwe have same rules for our kids (one specifically \ud83d\ude09) if they come up with excuses for not wanting to eat.", "NTA\n\nHow are you the bad guy here? A kid who didn\u2019t finish his dinner and an adult are not on equal footing. \n\nYou are allowed to have ice cream and he is not. Your partner seems too focused on taking the sting out of his son\u2019s punishments. Not a good dynamic. It could have been a teachable moment for his son.", "A wise pediatrician told us when our first was born that the caregiver's responsibility is to provide healthy food options and the child's responsibility is to eat it. At 10, your son can opt to eat what you make or make himself something else. You don't need to be measuring out portions and fighting with him over whether he finishes them. Desserts/snacks shouldn't be rewards either. They are just calories of a different sort that should be consumed sparingly. I'm extremely confused by the idea that chips, fruit snacks, and granola bars are totally fine but ice cream is the forbidden sin.\n\nI'd recommend changing the way you manage food as a family. Buy less snacks and junk and stop controlling access entirely. Let him choose what to do and take away the duty/reward framework around food.  Give him the opportunity to learn how to be responsible for his food choices. He can opt to eat chips for three days, but if you go to the store once a week, there won't be chips on days 4-7. He'll figure it out. Everyone will be much happier in the long run.", "NTA. But it sounds like you guys have never eaten dessert in front of him like that. So of course it was shocking.

He is old enough to understand he follows mum-rules and dad-rules in the relevant house. \n\nIf he\u2019s used to a pre-sleep snack then that would be worth continuing, since he will be physically used to it - but you can limit it to a couple of fairly boring options - eg one slice of toast & butter, banana, (third thing).

If not, the dessert was proportionally sized. We used to always make ice cream sundaes in coffee mugs. One time she ate hardly anything for dinner so I made hers in a spoon.

Do you know how much sugar is in a pb&j?", "NTA, eat your ice cream right in his face, flaunt how delicious it is, and remind him that he could have some if he would eat his dinner.", "Yta. So he cant have two bites of icecream because he was full earlier? Makes zero sense. You can eat more calories because you had more calories earlier? Because he ate less calories he gets less calories later. Way to encourage eating disorder behaviour op and all the ntas. You can be full and then hungry 3 hours later.  Youre teaching him to ignore his hunger cues. Dessert isnt a reward. Its food. Poor kiddo.", "NTA. I have a 9-year-old and we also go through this. If she is full, and doesn't have room for food in her stomach, then she doesn't have room for sweets in her stomach. The fact that I had room for food and sweets is irrelevant.", "NTA and don not hide while eating dessert ever!", "NTA at all. You bet your ass when my 4yo refuses to finish his dinner he gets to watch his father and I eat dessert in front of him and he doesn't get a single bite. He used to melt down about it, but these days he takes it more in stride and it's even resulted in the intended effect (watching him spitefully eat veggies is a bright spot of my day). Shielding kids from the consequences of their actions to avoid outbursts is not a good parenting method, I'm sorry.", "YTA. So you're allowed to have ice cream but your son can't unless he eats what you tell him to beforehand.", "NTA from a mother of a 10yo\n\nWhy was he getting a snack though? Did Dad say ok? If he didn't finish dinner my kid wouldn't get a snack. There's still sugar in fruit and granola bars", "NTA but neither is the kid- he's allowed to have feelings re: the ice cream and that's fine. But that doesn't mean y'all should cave and give him the ice cream. Partner shouldn't be mad at you that kid has feelings or mad at kid for having feelings. Gracefully handling kids' emotions is in the job description for being a parent.", "You ate your dinner.  Grant is seeing the direct consequences of his actions.  You are NA but your partner needs to do a better job of setting boundaries and not constantly altering your lives to dance around when Grant has to live with consequences.   It\u2019s hard to be the \u201cbad guy\u201d with his mom\u2019s house not setting rules but that means it\u2019s even more important to hold to clear and consistent boundaries.", "NTA. Grant is 10-years old, not 3. He's old enough to understand what is meant when you tell him that if he doesn't eat healthy food, he will not get dessert. You did not wave the ice cream in front of his face, unless the refrigerator is physically located in front of the Xbox. He got up to see what you were doing and then whine his way around the rules.\n\nOldest of 14 kids, mother of 3, stepmother of 2, grandmother of 9. This is a common game kids play.", "Nta.\n\nEvery parent has rules. He didn't listen, so he didn't get ice cream.\n\nYou didn't rub it in his face at all. He's a boy who threw a tantrum because he was told no.", "You are not in the wrong. The kid needs to learn that if you don\u2019t eat all your food you don\u2019t get dessert. Otherwise every kid everywhere would take only 2 bites of food, then ask for dessert. We all did it when we were kids lol. Yeah you need to hide in your own house and eat dessert hahahah. Your man is dumb lol", "NTA. My kids don\u2019t get dessert if they don\u2019t finish. And I have zero issue enjoying some myself or letting those that finish have some. He\u2019s 10. Crying over icecream is a bit extreme at that age. Sounds like they were crocodile tears based on his dad\u2019s reaction.", "NTA. You can\u2019t have any pudding if you don\u2019t eat your meat", "NTA he had plenty of food option to eat and you made it clear dessert was only for people who ate dinner first. Perfectly reasonable and if he wanted dessert he could have changed his mind about not eating dinner", "I wish more people understood this.", "I would say you should eat it in front of him (or just as naturally! With no regard) - he knows the rules! If he wants sweets he can have them IF he eats healthy food first. It\u2019s just a basic reminder.", "Yeah it's not fair for husband to put you in the position of being the \"mean mom\" bc he's uncomfortable w his kid's negative emotions. The book How to Talk So Kids Will Listen is a bit dated (in that the examples of what not to do are horrifying given the time period it was first written in) but has some good stuff in there about how you can't just show up for the positive/fun times in a kid's life and then expect them to come to you when they're having a hard time.", "Sounds like you and Grant may have an eating disorder and are passing it on to this 10 year old child.\n3 or 4 bites of something?\nHave healthy snacks like fruits and veggies instead of ice cream and chips.\nEating burgers and fries in moderation is fine if you also eat better foods in between. My husband stopped at Burger King today to get me a rare treat of a milk shake and i was disappointed they don't have a grilled chicken sandwich anymore. It wasn't as good as what I make but it was a better option than a double bacon cheeseburger.", "Yeah, the boy is a ten year old, not a two year old.  He's fully capable of figuring out that actions have consequences.", "I HATED having to clean my plate to get a dessert.  If I left one pea or corn kernel my parents would say NO dessert for you.   But, I knew the rules and eventually didn't even try to like different foods since I wouldn't get the ice cream 75% of the time anyway.  I would offer the meal first, and then after everyone finished offer dessert.  to everyone still sitting at the table.  Either way OP nta for following an agreed upon rule.", "It's not really a reward. If you are too full for healthy food, then you are too full for dessert.", "Yeah, clean plates club is a great way towards eating disorders (not in every case!) but in this case the kid took 2 bites so not enough to merit dessert. I would have had the ice cream as soon as main course was done, any questions? \"I ate my dinner so I get dessert\"", "I hated cleaning my plate, too, but my mother was the worst cook in the world. If she'd made some yummy lasagna like OP, I would have scarfed it down.", "They offered for the child to eat a small healthy snack and then getting desert.", "2030 is plenty enough past dinner time, close to bed to have a munchy. As stepmom has proven. The kid clearly had enough, went for a munchy, catches step mum with her ice cream so of course he wants that now. The ice cream wasn't desert, it was munchies. Step mum should have owned up and shared.", "Whatever you want to call it, he was given the option to eat something nutritious if he got hungry after dinner and then they could revisit dessert. That's a perfectly reasonable boundary so that the kid isn't always just eating junk.", "If we\u2019re talking the size of the child\u2019s fist, it seems actually pretty proportional.", "He wasn\u2019t punished for saying he was full. He was punished because he was aware of this agreement and had a tantrum anyway because he couldn\u2019t have the ice cream.", "what are you talking about??\n\nYou have quite the vibrant imagination.\n\nTraditional lasagna is not healthy food.\n\nOP said they offered A PB$&J sandwich as an alternative.  That with white bread and mass produced PB&J is not healthy.  All of those things typically have corn syrup in them.  The sugar content of that sandwich could be higher than the ice cream.  Hell, jelly alone has as much sugar as some ice creams.\n\nTeaching a kid that they have to keep eating when they are full in order to get dessert is how you create kids that overeat.  Or so said the nutrionist I consulted with when I had the same attiutude as OP.  \n\nAlso, thats what research says.\n\n[https://www.scarymommy.com/parenting/should-you-make-kids-eat-everything-on-plate](https://www.scarymommy.com/parenting/should-you-make-kids-eat-everything-on-plate)\n\n[https://www.newsweek.com/why-parents-shouldnt-force-food-picky-children-according-new-study-1044934](https://www.newsweek.com/why-parents-shouldnt-force-food-picky-children-according-new-study-1044934)\n\n[https://georgiahaasnutrition.com/2022/04/04/surprising-repercussions-clean-plate-club/](https://georgiahaasnutrition.com/2022/04/04/surprising-repercussions-clean-plate-club/)\n\n[https://www.nurturelife.com/blog/re-thinking-clean-plate-strategy/](https://www.nurturelife.com/blog/re-thinking-clean-plate-strategy/)\n\nHere\u2019s one from the Journal of American Medicine,  \n\n[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/717915](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/717915)"]}
