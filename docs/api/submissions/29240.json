It was helpful, even some I disagreed with. While things aren't perfect, they're both good kids and my wife is making amends for what she did.\n\n\nSince then my wife and I have been in therapy. She's apologised and tried fix it with Charlotte, but she lost a lot of trust with what she said. Even now it's not back to what it was. The therapy is helping, and she realised just how wrong it was.\n\n\nCharlotte has mostly gone back to normal around me, though a bit clingier. I've made it clear I'll always love and be there for her. And I've been making it clear it's unconditional, and she doesn't have to be perfect or 'deserve' it. She's obviously still in therapy and getting help. The girls have had some stupid fights since, but nothing like last time. Charlotte initially distanced herself, but Chloe got her back to normal quicker than my wife and I. She was really there for Charlotte. When she wants to be, she can be really thoughtful. Chloe is doing fine. I made sure to talk to her and she doesn't have an issue with Charlotte. As usual she basically said Charlotte can be annoying but she loves her, a normal sister.\n\n\nIt's not perfect, but improving. I think my wife's actions were a mistake, but they were from the situation rather than about Charlotte herself. All the little issues built up and she exploded. She didn't realise how much it grew to bother her. She's made it clear she knows Charlotte is our daughter now and that it was a horrible mistake. We are working to fix it. If she really can't handle it I will have to leave for Charlotte's sake, but I think our progress is promising so far.\n\n\nNow I want to clarify some things:\n\n\nCharlotte did have issues with women. However this wasn't her being rude per se. The issue was that she was terrified. She would basically be silent and overly obedient, but clearly scared and unwilling to open up. With me she let her guard down quicker to let me love and help her. For my wife it took months for more than one word answers and almost two year to stop the fear. Back talking and interjections were a problem, but because she was comfortable with my wife, not the opposite.\n\n\nI was heavily involved in raising the girls. I didn't leave it to my wife. I just happened to be working late that day, other days it's my wife working and me with the girls. Further, there are consequences for misbehaving. We just had a bigger issue that night.\n\n\nOverall, thank you for the advice. I hope things keep getting better, even if it's slow.", "created_utc": 1697728992, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17blq94/update_aita_pissed_at_what_my_wife_said_to_my/", "score": 213, "replies": ["Very happy to see this update! I'm glad your wife was able to come around and see what she said was incredibly hurtful and wrong. Both your daughters sound like good kids, and you guys will all come out as a strong family unit once the hardships wash over. Rare to see positive updates, so thank you for sharing!\n\nBest wishes to your family to continue to grow together! \ud83c\udf1f", "Your wife's actions and what she said was more than a \"mistake\".  It's great that you're all seeking therapy, but the words we get told, especially negative, never goes away. Charlotte will learn to deal, but it will always stay in the back of her mind as an emotional scar. \n\nAnd what happens the next time this happens? Because I doubt this will be a one off situation. It never is.\n\nJFC, telling someone she'll go back to her abusive parents if she doesn't behave. Unbelievable!!!\n\nLets hope Charlotte moves past the idiocy of others and has a happy and full life, despite the garbage hand she's been dealt so far.", "How did your wife come around to finally see how she was wrong? Does she actually have regret or feel upset that Charlotte is now distant with her?", "People here need to cut the wife some slack. What she said was horrendous and horrible but she is also watching someone she gave birth to constantly ridiculed by another kid. From what i read it seems like she never really accepted charlotte as her daughter and just thought of her a niece. Which honestly given the time span and the constant insults towards her one kid I can see that. But she was wrong and she should have never said that and it was inexcusable. But some people are acting like she\u2019s abusing her too and that\u2019s just wrong. This family has through a lot some slack needs to be given here.", "Glad to hear your wife is doing this work to ensure a happy household. \n\nStill side-eyeing your dismissive attitude about Chloe and how consistent insults from someone in her home impact her,  but hey, we can\u2019t have everything", "Thank you for the update!  I'm so happy that Chloe and Charlotte were able to patch things up quickly - you all are doing something right here!  I have three girls and sisters fight, nothing abnormal about that.  It's unfortunate that your wife is having such a difficult time, but unlike everyone screaming divorce all the time on this sub, working things through with your wife will have two very beneficial effects - your girls will grow up in a stable, two-parent household and your girls will see that people can have feelings, make mistakes, and work things out.  Good luck to all of you!", "Good update to read and glad everyone is fully participating in therapy! I admire what you\u2019ve done for your niece and it\u2019s heartwarming to read that she has a loving family after what she\u2019s been through. \n\nI hope therapy continues to help everyone!", "And what are the consequences to your wife misbehaving? I\u2019m sorry OP but I\u2019m floored by the fact that after your wife weaponized charlotte\u2019s deepest trauma over a petty argument, you all are just moving on and operating as if this was a little mistake that you all just need to move past. \n\nI wish we could jail emotionally abusive people like your wife for their destruction as well.\n\n**EDIT: I used the word \"consequences\" because I was mirroring OP's words \"there are consequences to actions\" when talking about Charlotte. The POINT is getting the wife the fuck away from Charlotte, NOT to \"punish\" for their actions. \n\nBesides, on a purely logical level how is it ok for you to show consequences for Charlotte but not consequences for OP's wife??", "I'm sorry, but if I were you, I still wouldn't trust your wife. The fact that your wife went there at all in a dispute between the kids shows that she genuinely doesn't see Charlotte as fully part of her family unit. The fact that your wife went there in such a big way makes me worry that she has done it in smaller ways in the past and may continue to be. If I were you, I'd consider that Charlotte's issues make her the perfect victim here. I obviously don't know her, but from what you've described, Charlotte may genuinely not tell you if your wife's behavior continues. She feels like she needs to be a perfect kid in order to be loved, and it seems likely that the potential disruption that would come if she told you about continued abuse would prevent her from telling you.\n\nIt also sounds like your wife might benefit from classes geared toward parenting teenagers in a healthy way. What she did was so wildly inappropriate that it's genuinely hard to put into words, and the fact that she didn't see that immediately means it's either what she actually believes (and she's just hiding it because she's knows you'll leave her), or she genuinely doesn't know what appropriate parenting looks like", "Your wife is doing this just because to says \"divorce\". This is going to happen again. Be ready for that.. Your wife is only getting better for her own sake, she doesn't care about your daughter... Only her been.", "Thank you! And I hope it keeps getting better. Seeing Charlotte so hurt and isolated again was horrible. But both girls are great in their own ways. I definitely hope we all come out better.", "If it's not a one off I intend to leave her, and that's been made pretty clear. And I'm doing everything I can to make sure Charlotte knows what was said was wrong and not how she really feels. I'm trying to make it clear my love to her and Chloe is unconditional, as I've been trying to all this time.", "After she had the time to properly calm down she agreed to see the therapist and talk more freely. And quickly realised how messed up it was. I do think it's real regret.", "Fr. He's neglecting both his wife and his own biological daughter and he's still too dense to admit it", "Chloe isn't consistently insulted. Charlotte can act out, but they're close. They have sibling squabbles, that sometimes leads to Charlotte saying the wrong thing as a result of her parents programming. She's not going around trying to hurt Chloe.", "Yeah they're good kids. They fight sometimes but get along. Obviously even now Charlotte hasn't fully unlearnt everything, but a lot better than she was. I definitely agree that it can work out and certainly hope it will.", "For the most part I'm just trying to listen to the therapist on it for that. It's not really punishment per se, but she is trying to work on making it up to Charlotte. Being punitive here isn't the answer unless we want to separate. What she did is horrible, but I think our approach is positive so far. Though I couldn't forgive her if it happens again.", "Accountability does not mean punishment. \n\nPer the OP, wife has taken accountability for her actions and is working to redeem herself with her family.", "And that is great you are in her corner, but I would observe how your wife (and even Chloe) treat Charlotte. Especially when you aren't around. Like if Charlotte is more withdrawn, not acting like herself, more than usual. They can potentially undo everything positive you try and do for Charlotte. And if it's not a one off, they will try so much harder to cover tracks.\n\nI sincerely hope that is not the case. Good luck as you continue to navigate through this.", "I truly hope that you\u2019re correct about your wife and hew viewpoint. \n\nHowever, \u201cShe knows Charlotte is our daughter.\u201d I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think she does. Would your wife have ever said to Chloe what she said to Charlotte? \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re all stressed out and justifiably so. But I think you also will need to face the fact that your wife truly does not view Charlotte as her daughter.", "Not trying to hurt doesn't mean not hurting.", "It's not about punishing your wife, it's at minimum, about not re-traumatizing the victim. The fact is that Charlotte shouldn't have to be rescued from one abusive situation only to be dropped right back into another abusive one.\n\nThe fact that your wife decided to weaponize a child's deepest core wound for such a petty matter is really telling to me. It's not even just re-traumatizing your child, it's traumatizing them in a whole different way as well.\n\nSo yes, I suppose in my mind the only thing to do right by Charlotte would be to separate.", "First of all, what has the wife done to take accountability? Second, Charlotte is a CHILD. Accountability doesn't heal trauma. Accountability just means that an adult acts like an adult and recognizes they did something wrong. Getting Charlotte out of a traumatizing situation is the priority.", "I've been doing this. Plus I've been making it clear to Charlotte to tell if anything happens even if I can't see it. I definitely hope so too. I would rather have it all go positive.", "I agree Charlotte shouldn't have to go through that. And I have taken it seriously. But being punitive won't solve anything. Were working to fix the cause and make sure it won't happen again.\n\nYou think I should just leave, and honestly I perfectly understand that. However I would rather work it out and have a positive ending. I'm still clear I support Charlotte and she knows what was said was wrong. I'm making clear it's unacceptable. But based on our progress I don't think this approach was a mistake. But if it happens again I will correct it permanently.", "What do you expect OP to do? Divorce the wife because she said that and uproot everyone's lives and stability? To make Charlotte feel like she caused the divorce? Accountability is realizing you were wrong, owning up to it, and working with the person you hurt, which OP said their wife has done. OP told us that Charlotte is making progress passed the situation. It was one time-- a horrible mistake, yes, but it hasn't happened before or since. They're all in therapy working through this. Nothing heals trauma and divorce creates more trauma. You're not their therapist, you're advocating for a punishment for someone who is learning from their mistakes that would bring chaos into that home and I hope OP doesn't pay you any mind.", "Accountability is going to therapy to better navigate the situation and improve herself and see things clearly. Relax.", "I hate to say this, but her regret might be coming more from being told clearly that you intend to leave her than over the actual treatment of her adoptive daughter.", "Is this like when you told your wife it was adopt Charlotte or divorce?", "You keep framing it as if separating is some punishment for your wife. No, separating is literally just taking a child out of a traumatizing situation.\n\nYour entire post is acting as if Charlotte's trauma is the problem to be dealt with. NO, your wife's ABUSE is the problem.\n\nI do hope that you're right that there CAN be a positive ending to this, but the fact is that you're choosing to force Charlotte to live with another abuser.", "LOL feeling like you caused a divorce is something you can ACTUALLY deal with via therapy. Being forced to live in constant fear with an abuser- that's a situation you canNOT work through with a little weekly therapy session. \n\nAnd why does everyone keep talking about punishment?! The point of separating isn't to PUNISH the wife, it's to create a SAFE ENVIRONMENT for Charlotte", "OP apparently said they'd get a divorce if she wasn't willing to adopt Charlotte in the first place.", "That was my thought too.\n\nThis can result in her acting like everything is good and she will never act this way again in fear of OP leaving her and not because she knows it's wrong. This has to be looked at carefully.", "If it's just one (completely horrible obviously) mistake, that's different from internal harm. There is a way to move on healthily. \n\nIf you're right and she hurts Charlotte again, or Charlotte is simply unable to live with her, then I will separate. I'm not minimising what she did, I know how disgusting it was. But this approach is on advice, not my gut reaction.", "I understand what she said was horrible but your stance is so rigid. How does making one horrible mistake = Charlotte being abused again by them? It sounds like they are working very hard to get her stable,  the wife is in therapy and I agree she will feel guilty if they divorce. Even if they take her to therapy. Are people not allowed to make mistakes, even horrendous ones, in parenting?", "She's not living with an abuser, she's living with a woman who, in anger, said a damaging thing because her kids were fighting. It's messed up and damaging, but that doesn't mean the wife is abusive. A divorce is not likely to create a safe environment for Charlotte, it's likely to cause more problems. You literally mentioned you wanted the wife to have consequences-- it's only when people said that's not the way that you said it was for the kid's sake. It's a shame you think one action defines OP's wife and that you don't seem to think there's such a thing as progress. Typical reddit wanting everyone to divorce.", "Agreed. When a person knows that they are wrong they take accountability for it immediately and also apologize. Her refusal to do so spoke volumes. Her silence spoke volumes. When words leave our mouth we cannot take them back. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThose words were malicious and cruel. This was not an oops my bad slip of the tongue. The words and lack of genuine remorse is egregious.\n\nAbuse leaves behind deep wounds that never truly go away. I speak from experience as a child SA victim. You learn how to manage your pain but it is always lurking.\n\nI believe that OP\u2019s wife has harbored these feelings since the adoption. For me it would be a deal breaker. I am not going to knowingly stay with a person who said a treated a victim so cruelly. Nope.", "So if Charlotte refuses to live with her, even if she does nothing else wrong you will leave her and traumatise your daughter\n\nDon't you think that might cause some.bitterness and resentment on your daughters part\n\nThis is a shit show", "Ok, well I hope you're working with a child psychologist (PHD) who specializes in trauma and listening to THEIR advice not just some therapist who works primarily with adults. \n\nAlso I will say that your daughter does seem great. She's probably the highlight of everyone in this situation. \n\nGood luck.", "Yep and sorry but as unforgivable and horrendous as this was, this is also a parent who had to witness her one kid constantly harassing the other and advocated (extremely poorly). Sorry but Charlotte may be the victim of abuse, but that doesn\u2019t absolve her of constantly insulting Chloe, for things beyond her control. Reddit really just chose not to see any nuance here and the commenters still calling for the wife\u2019s \u201cpunishment\u201d is so disappointing.", "That's what I feel. People can say horrible things once and that doesn't make it abuse-- everyone is an abuser, then. Life is not so black and white. People make mistakes, sometimes these mistakes other people, and learn and grow from them. How can we say that the wife must be removed without thinking of the wife's growth or the dire consequences that happen, especially with children, when that happens? If this was reoccurring then I would agree that separation would be best, but it's not reoccurring and we have no evidence that it is", "A mistake is saying something like \"Shut up\" or yelling \"How dare you?\" -- both of those are bad but they are honest mistakes. A mistake is not targeting a child's abusive past and weaponizing it against her, and threatening to put the child back into an abusive situation.", "I used the phrasing consequences because OP used the phrasing \"there are consequences for misbehaving\" in relation to punishing the niece. If you actually read what I have been saying - I could give a shit about OP's wife - just get her away from Charlotte!", "100% Seriously i think If anyone had to admit what they said and did in their worst moment it would be classified as \u201cabuse\u201d. It\u2019s horrible, and accountability is wife understanding Charlotte has lost trust in her and could permanently while still working to be a good mom and and repair it. Not op taking a stand that will probably  make the situation worse for everyone when everyone is trying! I agree it would be very different if the wife didn\u2019t see what she did was wrong.", "So you have never said anything out of anger that was really bad or using someone\u2019s past against them? Your parents have never done the same to you? You never have hurt someone\u2019s feelings by mentioning something very hurtful to them? I am just trying to understand what insane moral high ground you are on to classify his wife as an abuser, so I really need to understand how toy have managed to be so perfect your entire life?"]}
