{"id": 29240, "submission_id": "17blq94", "title": "UPDATE: AITA pissed at what my wife said to my niece", "selftext": "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/tICbLJvzc7)\n\nFirst I want to thank everyone for their responses. It was helpful, even some I disagreed with. While things aren't perfect, they're both good kids and my wife is making amends for what she did.\n\n\nSince then my wife and I have been in therapy. She's apologised and tried fix it with Charlotte, but she lost a lot of trust with what she said. Even now it's not back to what it was. The therapy is helping, and she realised just how wrong it was.\n\n\nCharlotte has mostly gone back to normal around me, though a bit clingier. I've made it clear I'll always love and be there for her. And I've been making it clear it's unconditional, and she doesn't have to be perfect or 'deserve' it. She's obviously still in therapy and getting help. The girls have had some stupid fights since, but nothing like last time. Charlotte initially distanced herself, but Chloe got her back to normal quicker than my wife and I. She was really there for Charlotte. When she wants to be, she can be really thoughtful. Chloe is doing fine. I made sure to talk to her and she doesn't have an issue with Charlotte. As usual she basically said Charlotte can be annoying but she loves her, a normal sister.\n\n\nIt's not perfect, but improving. I think my wife's actions were a mistake, but they were from the situation rather than about Charlotte herself. All the little issues built up and she exploded. She didn't realise how much it grew to bother her. She's made it clear she knows Charlotte is our daughter now and that it was a horrible mistake. We are working to fix it. If she really can't handle it I will have to leave for Charlotte's sake, but I think our progress is promising so far.\n\n\nNow I want to clarify some things:\n\n\nCharlotte did have issues with women. However this wasn't her being rude per se. The issue was that she was terrified. She would basically be silent and overly obedient, but clearly scared and unwilling to open up. With me she let her guard down quicker to let me love and help her. For my wife it took months for more than one word answers and almost two year to stop the fear. Back talking and interjections were a problem, but because she was comfortable with my wife, not the opposite.\n\n\nI was heavily involved in raising the girls. I didn't leave it to my wife. I just happened to be working late that day, other days it's my wife working and me with the girls. Further, there are consequences for misbehaving. We just had a bigger issue that night.\n\n\nOverall, thank you for the advice. I hope things keep getting better, even if it's slow.", "created_utc": 1697728992, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17blq94/update_aita_pissed_at_what_my_wife_said_to_my/", "score": 1000, "replies": ["Very happy to see this update! I'm glad your wife was able to come around and see what she said was incredibly hurtful and wrong. Both your daughters sound like good kids, and you guys will all come out as a strong family unit once the hardships wash over. Rare to see positive updates, so thank you for sharing!\n\nBest wishes to your family to continue to grow together! \ud83c\udf1f", "Your wife's actions and what she said was more than a \"mistake\".  It's great that you're all seeking therapy, but the words we get told, especially negative, never goes away. Charlotte will learn to deal, but it will always stay in the back of her mind as an emotional scar. \n\nAnd what happens the next time this happens? Because I doubt this will be a one off situation. It never is.\n\nJFC, telling someone she'll go back to her abusive parents if she doesn't behave. Unbelievable!!!\n\nLets hope Charlotte moves past the idiocy of others and has a happy and full life, despite the garbage hand she's been dealt so far.", "How did your wife come around to finally see how she was wrong? Does she actually have regret or feel upset that Charlotte is now distant with her?", "People here need to cut the wife some slack. What she said was horrendous and horrible but she is also watching someone she gave birth to constantly ridiculed by another kid. From what i read it seems like she never really accepted charlotte as her daughter and just thought of her a niece. Which honestly given the time span and the constant insults towards her one kid I can see that. But she was wrong and she should have never said that and it was inexcusable. But some people are acting like she\u2019s abusing her too and that\u2019s just wrong. This family has through a lot some Grace needs to be given here.", "Glad to hear your wife is doing this work to ensure a happy household. \n\nStill side-eyeing your dismissive attitude about Chloe and how consistent insults from someone in her home impact her,  but hey, we can\u2019t have everything", "Thank you for the update!  I'm so happy that Chloe and Charlotte were able to patch things up quickly - you all are doing something right here!  I have three girls and sisters fight, nothing abnormal about that.  It's unfortunate that your wife is having such a difficult time, but unlike everyone screaming divorce all the time on this sub, working things through with your wife will have two very beneficial effects - your girls will grow up in a stable, two-parent household and your girls will see that people can have feelings, make mistakes, and work things out.  Good luck to all of you!", "Good update to read and glad everyone is fully participating in therapy! I admire what you\u2019ve done for your niece and it\u2019s heartwarming to read that she has a loving family after what she\u2019s been through. \n\nI hope therapy continues to help everyone!", "And what are the consequences to your wife misbehaving? I\u2019m sorry OP but I\u2019m floored by the fact that after your wife weaponized charlotte\u2019s deepest trauma over a petty argument, you all are just moving on and operating as if this was a little mistake that you all just need to move past. \n\nI wish we could jail emotionally abusive people like your wife for their destruction as well.\n\n**EDIT: I used the word \"consequences\" because I was mirroring OP's words \"there are consequences to actions\" when talking about Charlotte. The POINT is getting the wife the fuck away from Charlotte, NOT to \"punish\" for their actions. \n\nBesides, on a purely logical level how is it ok for you to show consequences for Charlotte but not consequences for OP's wife??", "I'm sorry, but if I were you, I still wouldn't trust your wife. The fact that your wife went there at all in a dispute between the kids shows that she genuinely doesn't see Charlotte as fully part of her family unit. The fact that your wife went there in such a big way makes me worry that she has done it in smaller ways in the past and may continue to be. If I were you, I'd consider that Charlotte's issues make her the perfect victim here. I obviously don't know her, but from what you've described, Charlotte may genuinely not tell you if your wife's behavior continues. She feels like she needs to be a perfect kid in order to be loved, and it seems likely that the potential disruption that would come if she told you about continued abuse would prevent her from telling you.\n\nIt also sounds like your wife might benefit from classes geared toward parenting teenagers in a healthy way. What she did was so wildly inappropriate that it's genuinely hard to put into words, and the fact that she didn't see that immediately means it's either what she actually believes (and she's just hiding it because she's knows you'll leave her), or she genuinely doesn't know what appropriate parenting looks like", "Your wife is doing this just because to says \"divorce\". This is going to happen again. Be ready for that.. Your wife is only getting better for her own sake, she doesn't care about your daughter... Only her been.", "Thank you! And I hope it keeps getting better. Seeing Charlotte so hurt and isolated again was horrible. But both girls are great in their own ways. I definitely hope we all come out better.", "If it's not a one off I intend to leave her, and that's been made pretty clear. And I'm doing everything I can to make sure Charlotte knows what was said was wrong and not how she really feels. I'm trying to make it clear my love to her and Chloe is unconditional, as I've been trying to all this time.", "After she had the time to properly calm down she agreed to see the therapist and talk more freely. And quickly realised how messed up it was. I do think it's real regret.", "Fr. He's neglecting both his wife and his own biological daughter and he's still too dense to admit it", "Chloe isn't consistently insulted. Charlotte can act out, but they're close. They have sibling squabbles, that sometimes leads to Charlotte saying the wrong thing as a result of her parents programming. She's not going around trying to hurt Chloe.", "Yeah they're good kids. They fight sometimes but get along. Obviously even now Charlotte hasn't fully unlearnt everything, but a lot better than she was. I definitely agree that it can work out and certainly hope it will.", "For the most part I'm just trying to listen to the therapist on it for that. It's not really punishment per se, but she is trying to work on making it up to Charlotte. Being punitive here isn't the answer unless we want to separate. What she did is horrible, but I think our approach is positive so far. Though I couldn't forgive her if it happens again.", "Accountability does not mean punishment. \n\nPer the OP, wife has taken accountability for her actions and is working to redeem herself with her family.", "And that is great you are in her corner, but I would observe how your wife (and even Chloe) treat Charlotte. Especially when you aren't around. Like if Charlotte is more withdrawn, not acting like herself, more than usual. They can potentially undo everything positive you try and do for Charlotte. And if it's not a one off, they will try so much harder to cover tracks.\n\nI sincerely hope that is not the case. Good luck as you continue to navigate through this.", "I truly hope that you\u2019re correct about your wife and hew viewpoint. \n\nHowever, \u201cShe knows Charlotte is our daughter.\u201d I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think she does. Would your wife have ever said to Chloe what she said to Charlotte? \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re all stressed out and justifiably so. But I think you also will need to face the fact that your wife truly does not view Charlotte as her daughter.", "Not trying to hurt doesn't mean not hurting.", "It's not about punishing your wife, it's at minimum, about not re-traumatizing the victim. The fact is that Charlotte shouldn't have to be rescued from one abusive situation only to be dropped right back into another abusive one.\n\nThe fact that your wife decided to weaponize a child's deepest core wound for such a petty matter is really telling to me. It's not even just re-traumatizing your child, it's traumatizing them in a whole different way as well.\n\nSo yes, I suppose in my mind the only thing to do right by Charlotte would be to separate.", "First of all, what has the wife done to take accountability? Second, Charlotte is a CHILD. Accountability doesn't heal trauma. Accountability just means that an adult acts like an adult and recognizes they did something wrong. Getting Charlotte out of a traumatizing situation is the priority.", "I've been doing this. Plus I've been making it clear to Charlotte to tell if anything happens even if I can't see it. I definitely hope so too. I would rather have it all go positive.", "I agree Charlotte shouldn't have to go through that. And I have taken it seriously. But being punitive won't solve anything. Were working to fix the cause and make sure it won't happen again.\n\nYou think I should just leave, and honestly I perfectly understand that. However I would rather work it out and have a positive ending. I'm still clear I support Charlotte and she knows what was said was wrong. I'm making clear it's unacceptable. But based on our progress I don't think this approach was a mistake. But if it happens again I will correct it permanently.", "What do you expect OP to do? Divorce the wife because she said that and uproot everyone's lives and stability? To make Charlotte feel like she caused the divorce? Accountability is realizing you were wrong, owning up to it, and working with the person you hurt, which OP said their wife has done. OP told us that Charlotte is making progress passed the situation. It was one time-- a horrible mistake, yes, but it hasn't happened before or since. They're all in therapy working through this. Nothing heals trauma and divorce creates more trauma. You're not their therapist, you're advocating for a punishment for someone who is learning from their mistakes that would bring chaos into that home and I hope OP doesn't pay you any mind.", "Accountability is going to therapy to better navigate the situation and improve herself and see things clearly. Relax.", "I hate to say this, but her regret might be coming more from being told clearly that you intend to leave her than over the actual treatment of her adoptive daughter.", "Is this like when you told your wife it was adopt Charlotte or divorce?", "You keep framing it as if separating is some punishment for your wife. No, separating is literally just taking a child out of a traumatizing situation.\n\nYour entire post is acting as if Charlotte's trauma is the problem to be dealt with. NO, your wife's ABUSE is the problem.\n\nI do hope that you're right that there CAN be a positive ending to this, but the fact is that you're choosing to force Charlotte to live with another abuser.", "LOL feeling like you caused a divorce is something you can ACTUALLY deal with via therapy. Being forced to live in constant fear with an abuser- that's a situation you canNOT work through with a little weekly therapy session. \n\nAnd why does everyone keep talking about punishment?! The point of separating isn't to PUNISH the wife, it's to create a SAFE ENVIRONMENT for Charlotte", "OP apparently said they'd get a divorce if she wasn't willing to adopt Charlotte in the first place.", "That was my thought too.\n\nThis can result in her acting like everything is good and she will never act this way again in fear of OP leaving her and not because she knows it's wrong. This has to be looked at carefully.", "If it's just one (completely horrible obviously) mistake, that's different from internal harm. There is a way to move on healthily. \n\nIf you're right and she hurts Charlotte again, or Charlotte is simply unable to live with her, then I will separate. I'm not minimising what she did, I know how disgusting it was. But this approach is on advice, not my gut reaction.", "I understand what she said was horrible but your stance is so rigid. How does making one horrible mistake = Charlotte being abused again by them? It sounds like they are working very hard to get her stable,  the wife is in therapy and I agree she will feel guilty if they divorce. Even if they take her to therapy. Are people not allowed to make mistakes, even horrendous ones, in parenting?", "She's not living with an abuser, she's living with a woman who, in anger, said a damaging thing because her kids were fighting. It's messed up and damaging, but that doesn't mean the wife is abusive. A divorce is not likely to create a safe environment for Charlotte, it's likely to cause more problems. You literally mentioned you wanted the wife to have consequences-- it's only when people said that's not the way that you said it was for the kid's sake. It's a shame you think one action defines OP's wife and that you don't seem to think there's such a thing as progress. Typical reddit wanting everyone to divorce.", "Agreed. When a person knows that they are wrong they take accountability for it immediately and also apologize. Her refusal to do so spoke volumes. Her silence spoke volumes. When words leave our mouth we cannot take them back. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThose words were malicious and cruel. This was not an oops my bad slip of the tongue. The words and lack of genuine remorse is egregious.\n\nAbuse leaves behind deep wounds that never truly go away. I speak from experience as a child SA victim. You learn how to manage your pain but it is always lurking.\n\nI believe that OP\u2019s wife has harbored these feelings since the adoption. For me it would be a deal breaker. I am not going to knowingly stay with a person who said a treated a victim so cruelly. Nope.", "So if Charlotte refuses to live with her, even if she does nothing else wrong you will leave her and traumatise your daughter\n\nDon't you think that might cause some.bitterness and resentment on your daughters part\n\nThis is a shit show", "Ok, well I hope you're working with a child psychologist (PHD) who specializes in trauma and listening to THEIR advice not just some therapist who works primarily with adults. \n\nAlso I will say that your daughter does seem great. She's probably the highlight of everyone in this situation. \n\nGood luck.", "Yep and sorry but as unforgivable and horrendous as this was, this is also a parent who had to witness her one kid constantly harassing the other and advocated (extremely poorly). Sorry but Charlotte may be the victim of abuse, but that doesn\u2019t absolve her of constantly insulting Chloe, for things beyond her control. Reddit really just chose not to see any nuance here and the commenters still calling for the wife\u2019s \u201cpunishment\u201d is so disappointing.", "That's what I feel. People can say horrible things once and that doesn't make it abuse-- everyone is an abuser, then. Life is not so black and white. People make mistakes, sometimes these mistakes other people, and learn and grow from them. How can we say that the wife must be removed without thinking of the wife's growth or the dire consequences that happen, especially with children, when that happens? If this was reoccurring then I would agree that separation would be best, but it's not reoccurring and we have no evidence that it is", "A mistake is saying something like \"Shut up\" or yelling \"How dare you?\" -- both of those are bad but they are honest mistakes. A mistake is not targeting a child's abusive past and weaponizing it against her, and threatening to put the child back into an abusive situation.", "I used the phrasing consequences because OP used the phrasing \"there are consequences for misbehaving\" in relation to punishing the niece. If you actually read what I have been saying - I could give a shit about OP's wife - just get her away from Charlotte!", "100% Seriously i think If anyone had to admit what they said and did in their worst moment it would be classified as \u201cabuse\u201d. It\u2019s horrible, and accountability is wife understanding Charlotte has lost trust in her and could permanently while still working to be a good mom and and repair it. Not op taking a stand that will probably  make the situation worse for everyone when everyone is trying! I agree it would be very different if the wife didn\u2019t see what she did was wrong.", "So you have never said anything out of anger that was really bad or using someone\u2019s past against them? Your parents have never done the same to you? You never have hurt someone\u2019s feelings by mentioning something very hurtful to them? I am just trying to understand what insane moral high ground you are on to classify his wife as an abuser, so I really need to understand how toy have managed to be so perfect your entire life?\n\nEdit: the definition of a mistake is an action that is misguided or wrong. The wife is working to prove her actions and words were wrong. I don\u2019t think you know what a mistake did because yelling \u201chow dare you\u201d literally isn\u2019t a \u201cmistake\u201d in basically any context\u2026", "Did you say anything at all to charlotte about not jumping in where it doesn\u2019t concern her? Constantly being called lazy and ungrateful has got to sting for Chloe. I hope you actually spoke to both girls because now charlotte could rile your wife up and no matter what charlotte says, if you wife says anything rude you\u2019ll take charlotte\u2019s side.", "ESH except Chloe.\n\nYour wife for what she said. \n\nYou for weaponizing divorce, financial instability, and the threat of a broken family to get what you want. Having good intentions doesn't negate the hurt you cause.\n\nCharlotte for taking out her trauma on Chloe. Calling Chloe the \"inferior daughter\" and spoiled for not doing chores is her trauma now being used to traumatize your other daughter. Saying these are just \"normal sibling fights but they love each other like sisters\" is doing more harm to Charlotte by minimizing her trauma and how she imposes it on others. \n\nYou need far more therapy to balance your savior complex with your responsibilities of being a father to BOTH of your daughters, not just Charlotte while also reasurring your wife that she isn't just some expendable woman in your life that you would drop at a moment's notice. One day she may just take you up on your offer and leave with Chloe if that's what you want.\n\nTrying to force everyone to play happy family is doing a disservice to everyone in it.", "Look, the fact that you'd leave your bio daughter is kinda fucked up. I'm not saying Charlotte deserves less than your bio daughter, but the way you said you'd have to take Charlotte and leave ..... \n\nWhat about your Chloe? Just gonna leave her behind?", "So, uh, are we going to address the fact that you gave her an ultimatum and said you'd divorce her if she didn't agree to adopt Charlotte?", "YTA. You left A LOT out so that you would be painted in a better light & look like the hero for taking in your niece. \n\nYou need to take a good, hard look at yourself & maybe think about individual therapy as well. \n\nWhat your wife said is wrong, there is no doubt about that, but I don\u2019t blame her for finally exploding considering how you treat her and your own biological daughter compared to your niece.", "Oh, I see you're still being gross and not giving a shit about your actual daughter and manipulating your wife. Good for you, I guess?", "Honestly. Wife deserves better. I'm not saying she's right. But what shit time not having any emotional support from you. No self reflecting on your end in that update. You gave her no choice but a utamatium for your marriage. That was never fair to her, and you know it.", ">If she really can't handle it I will have to leave for Charlotte's sake,\n\n~~That's...alarming. Does your wife know that you plan to leave her and your bio daughter in favor of your niece/adopted daughter if she doesn't toe the line?~~\n\n~~Did your wife ever really want to adopt Charlotte?~~\n\nI have some sympathy for your wife. There's a lot being unsaid here.\n\nEDIT: YTA, and I now have a lot of sympathy for your wife. You threatened her with divorce if she didn't go along with the adoption, and you continue to threaten her with leaving.\n\nYou say that your niece has a problem with women, can be pushy or a bit aggressive at times, is combative with your daughter. You don't know how bad she is with your wife when you're not around, and she certainly wouldn't tell you since her marriage is contingent on her acceptance of your niece. So she snapped.\n\nYou realize that your niece could make up anything against your wife, and you would believe her.\n\nShe went along with it thinking she could do this and save her marriage. Unfortunately, she made the wrong call. She should have taken your other daughter and let you go through with the divorce.\n\nIt reads like your downplaying a \\*lot\\* of things. Hopefully your wife is getting individual therapy as well, since she has no emotional support from her husband.", "I mean this in the kindest possible way- I think you\u2019re playing with fire and don\u2019t even realize it. \n\nYou\u2019ve created an unbalanced dynamic where Charlotte now holds a LOT of power. You seem to be very protective of Charlotte, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s motivated by her past, but you\u2019re threatening to separate with your wife if you\u2019re not happy with how she\u2019s interacting with Charlotte. I can\u2019t emphasize this enough- this wouldn\u2019t happen in a vacuum, and would create pain for your wife and Chloe. Your wife will have to evaluate how Charlotte will react to any situation because if Charlotte has a strong negative reaction (which, as a former teenage girl, I tell you we have those even when we\u2019re otherwise happy and well-adjusted), there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll blow up your family\u2019s life. \n\nDon\u2019t forget that our history/medical conditions/traumas/(fill in the blank) is an explanation, not an excuse. I really hope that, in addition to reminding Charlotte that she\u2019s loved and always a part of the family, you also made it clear that what she said about Chloe was unacceptable and won\u2019t be tolerated. You can love someone and still have boundaries on acceptable behavior. To adapt a phrase: Please don\u2019t set your wife and Chloe on fire to keep Charlotte warm.", "Yta. I really hope wife is able to recognize her worth in therapy, and remove herself from this toxic situation.", "If I was the wife, I\u2019d take Chloe and leave OP with that belligerent Charlotte. \ud83d\ude44 Maybe the OP and Charlotte will finally be happy once the wife and Chloe are out of the way.", "NTA. OP is planning to leave his wife because of this ONE incident? Wow this is very unexpected! \n\nIt\u2019s good that you love your niece so much but may I suggest this: Your wife isn\u2019t necessarily an evil human being. I think she distinguishes her own daughter from your niece because she hasn\u2019t mentally accepted your niece as her daughter until now(which is sad). This is why she spoke like that in the heat of the moment. BUT if she was genuinely an evil human being she would have hid this information from you. I am hoping this behaviour can change through therapy for the sake of your family. \n\nBut if you are planning on divorcing your wife because of this please keep in mind about your daughter Chloe. It\u2019s quite difficult for children to grow up with divorced parents.", "I am so glad that Charlotte is fine. However, your wife might slip up again. Chloe ofcourse loves her as her sister, because she is her sister. I think Charlotte has been forced on your wife and she is trying to act loving so that you donot leave her. I sincerely hope that i am wrong and that she actually loves her.", ">She's apologized and tried fix it with Charlotte, but she lost a lot of trust with what she said. Even now it's not back to what it was.\n\nIt will take years for your wife to repair the damage she caused, if she even can. You have to accept the possibility that Charlotte will never trust your wife again. \n\n>The therapy is helping, and she realized just how wrong it was.\r  \n\r\n\nI hope your wife is horrified and ashamed, so she doesn't repeat her bad act.\n\n>Charlotte has mostly gone back to normal around me, though a bit clingier.\n\nIt's no surprise that she's clingier. Since she can no longer trust your wife, she sees you as the only thing standing between her and being sent back to her abuser.\n\n>I think my wife's actions were a mistake ...  was a horrible mistake ...\n\nDon't call it a \"mistake\" - that implies accidentality. Your wife didn't traumatize Charlotte on accident; it was a deliberate choice on her part. \n\n>If she really can't handle it I will have to leave for Charlotte's sake\n\nI'm glad you're willing to choose your daughter over your wife. I hope it won't come to that, but if it does then it's good to hear you'll make the right choice. Too many parents make the wrong one, ruining their kids in the process.\n\n...\n\nOP, you sound like a good father. Chloe and Charlotte are lucky to have you.", "I\u2019m happy to see your wife has come around. I hope Charlotte and your wife can reconcile fully.\n\nI do think it will take time for Charlotte. She will never live a life where such a hurtful thing was *not* said to her. Your wife has a lot of growing and maturing to do.", "I would have kicked the wife out that day. Nope!!! Your wife literally said what she thinks of Charlotte, why don't you believe her? She sounds like a disgusting woman and not much better than your sister. The fact that she \"didn't know\" how atrocious what she said was, shows that she will continue to use \"I didn't know it was so hurtful\" with alligator tears. Good job, you saved Charlotte from one abusive home, just to bring her into another one. This one is just hidden behind a mask. I wonder what else your wife says when you're not around...", "I am going to you what I told my dad. I wish he had initiated or allowed my mother to send me back into the system once he realized she was abusive. She started hitting me and verbally abusing me as soon as the adoption papers were signed. Told me at least once a month she never wanted me and threatened to send me back 1-4 times a month. If he wasn\u2019t willing to divorce her to protect me he should\u2019ve sent me back. Being raised knowing you aren\u2019t wanted and all it will take is one mistake and you\u2019ll be shipped off is awful. I honestly do not believe that your wife realizes what she said is truly awful, she spoke her true feelings and is backtracking to keep you happy, but I suspect she will say it again or do other things to hurt the poor girl. So you need to decide now if you will divorce her if she does it again, if you wont then you need to look into a safer guardian just in case. If you die tomorrow do you really trust her to treat your daughter and niece the same? Do you believe she wouldn\u2019t kick the girl out first chance she got?", "Sir, you are a God send to those girls.", "Chloe could probably use a break from relentless emotional labour and being told she\u2019s an inferior daughter, so that would probably be for the best.", "It sounds like a four people sharing a house, two kids and a single parent for each.", "Right?! I'm surprised that point isn't being talked about more.", "Can't believe I had to keep scrolling to find this comment.", "I feel like I\u2019m not understanding something here. It\u2019s not really like you can compromise in a situation like this. He wanted to adopt Charlotte, and if his wife didn\u2019t then the logical option is separation/divorce because they have irreconcilable differences about how they want to live their lives. Wanting or not wanting children ends marriages all the time\u2013 ideally people discuss this before getting married, but in a situation like this it\u2019s not something that you can necessarily prepare for. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of similar comments though, so I wonder if I\u2019m just missing something here. I\u2019m curious to see what other people think OP should\u2019ve done in this situation.", "He told his wife he would break up their existing family in order to take in another family member who, by his admission, already has problems with other women. He continues to threaten to divorce her.\n\nHe's given his adoptive daughter power to tell him anything his wife does that the girl doesn't like so he can take action. That is a \\*wild\\* potential weapon to give to a child. She could easily lie and be believed.\n\nShe's been consistently combative with the other girl in the house, and he's given her power to rat on her as well.\n\nI'm not sure the wife is doing the work \"to ensure a happy household\". This is not a happy household. \n\nWe don't know what her other options are. If she works, or if she works but part-time/lower income, if he is the primary financial provider for the household.

But in that moment, your wife's instinct might have been to defend her daughter. She truly might not have meant it.\n\nMy point is not to say Charlotte deserved it, or your wife was in the right just that you shouldn't jump to the conclusion that your wife is some 2-dimensional evil stepmother sort of character.

We're seeing lots of \"documented issues with women\" comments and language about how no kid should be able to go to one of their parents to tattle on their other with the assurance that the parent will take action because it gives them too much power and kids can lie. No acknowledgement that adults can lie too and that the adult in question here has more motive to lie. His wife's motive to lie is to protect her marriage and the child she cares about remaining in a nuclear family\n\nWhereas Charlotte has little to no motivation to provoke a divorce. it's a guaranteed way to get her sister and mother to hate her and she struggles to believe that she is worthy of unconditional love and even though her father has promised that he will take action there's a good chance he doesn't actually believe it. And again the costs to her would be devastating. Both the wife and the two daughters all share the same motivation to lie to cover up for the mothers bad behaviour\n\nAnd saying that it gives your children too much power to tell that that you will listen to them and believe them and take action if someone does something devastatingly harmful to them? Fucking bonkers. Children have so little power that merely the promise to listen to them and trust them and take action to protect them is somehow giving them power over the adults who have enormous power over them\n\nThat's all you're missing.

Because there isn't anything else\n\nWhat makes this threatening divorce instead of simply discussing divorce because they have irreconcilable differences? \n\nWhat if he was no longer in love with his wife is he allowed to suggest divorce then? Under what circumstances is he allowed to bring up divorce without it being an ultimatum? Is he only allowed to bring up divorce is absolutely nothing she can do or say will change his mind? If there is anything his wife can do that will change his mind about getting divorced does that automatically make it a threat?\n\nWhen is it okay to bring up divorce as an option and what turns it into a threat here?\n\nBecause nothing I've read indicates this was a threat\n\nAnd sure we don't know anything about their finances or how financially secure she was solo (just that they both work), but there's no reason they couldn't get divorced and continue their current financial arrangement or something extremely close to it\n\nBringing up divorce as an option doesn't have to inherently mean removing whatever theoretical financial support he may have been providing. Hell it doesn't even need to necessarily end their romantic relationship. They could have continued in a relationship, continued shared parenting of Chloe, and he could have adopted Charlotte on his own. Maybe his ex-wife would have eventually grown close to Charlotte and wanted to adopt her similar to the way a step parent would. Maybe not\n\nBut the idea that divorce would automatically mean him removing financial support from her (that we don't even know exists) and the end of their romantic relationship isn't necessarily correct\n\nAnd even if one or both of those things is true that doesn't mean that he's never allowed to bring up divorce as an option without it being threatening and manipulative and abusive\n\nWhy is him bringing up divorce as an option inherently threatening? Why is this not simply a solution to irreconcilable differences and the logical outcome in a situation where one spouse wants to be a parent and the other does not? \n\nWhy is him bringing it up now not a boundary but a threat? What's the difference here?\n\nAnd what is your option for Charlotte if you're against them separating even being on the table but also don't want her abandoned? \n\nAnd if your answer is some bullshit about supporting her while she is in an abusive household or trying to fight for her to be taken into the foster care system.... nah, that's still totally abandoning her in this context and it's insisting that the wife's preferences about adopting a child override the husband's since you won't even give him the option of leaving the marriage\n\nLegally speaking in US, divorce is basically his only option for solo adoption. An adult can adopt a child on their own and they can adopt a child with their spouse but they cannot adopt a child alone while they are married. There are exceptions for things like the spouse being declared legally incompetent so you wouldn't have to divorce your spouse with Alzheimer's in order to adopt a child but other than that you do not really have options. Maybe there is one state or something that has really weird laws and has some loophole allowing married adults to adopt children solo but even if that's legally theoretically possible in somewhere, there is zero way of getting a fight for an abused child in another home through the legal system like that. Nada. Not to mention what it does to its child to be adopted into a home where only one parent is interested in raising them", "I don\u2019t think he should have brought up divorce either.

But the niece is in the wrong as well for how she treats the daughter & wife. Go back & read some of the comments on the older post as well. \n\nThe niece telling the daughter she should be a better daughter, like the niece is essentially telling Chloe that Charlotte is the better child. & it really doesn\u2019t seem like the dad is doing anything to correct the niece on her behaviors.", "No, I'm giving OP a hard time about it. And we have to be realistic here, kids do lie and manipulate. And OP being how he is, he won't listen to his wife or daughter if Charlotte actually lied about something.

One spat, does not make this kid evil incarnate.", "That's what I was trying to point out. We only know what OP has told us about his marriage and family dynamics, so I can't determine if giving ultimatums is a thing he commonly does to get his way or if this was an act of desperation. That's why I just asked if we were going to acknowledge him making this ultimatum, rather than writing a novel about \"omg he's so abusive obviously he's evil and his wife should divorce him and take Chloe and leave him with Charlotte like he wanted\" and blah blah. I can't make those inferences based on a snapshot of OP's life, especially since this is written by OP and the natural tendency is to present ourselves in the best possible light.", "> Does the wife even have the capability to leave him and take care of their daughter? Or is she another person who will be destitute if her husband leaves her?\n\nWhat? First off, we do know they both work. We don't know their finances past that but there's every possibility that they bring in equal money or that the wife even makes more. We have no idea. In terms of finances and other stuff we've absolutely no idea who holds more power and how much more, so no, best case scenario this isn't an unfair power dynamic\n\nSecondly why would the wife be solely responsible for their shared daughter? Why would he stop being Chloe's father? Why wouldn't they co-parent?\n\nAnd if the husband does have more financial power what precludes them from coming up with a divorce arrangement where he provides the same amount for his wife and Chloe that he always has? \n\nHell they wouldn't even have to end their romantic relationship if they didn't want to\n\nLegally speaking they were at an impasse. The husband wanted to adopt a child and the wife didn't. Either one of them gives into what the other wants or they separate so that they can both get what they want. The husband can adopt Charlotte and the wife doesn't have to\n\nIn looking through everything that we have heard the only thing that is abusive from anyone in this situation is the wife and adoptive mother telling her adopted daughter that she is lucky and their love and support is contingent on her behaviour \n\nWe haven't seen anything abusive from anyone else. And that doesn't mean it's not impossible, but your assumptions here are wild\n\nYou've for some reason decided that a spouse bringing up divorce as an option when they have an irreconcilable difference with their partner is threatening and manipulative. Uh why? if I have an issue with my partner and I state a very clear boundary or need and say that I can't stay in the relationship if that need isn't met or that boundary isn't respected, am I threatening them? Am I allowed to leave the relationship at all? am I only allowed to leave the relationship if there's absolutely nothing my partner can do that would change my mind and so I can't discuss the possibility of ending our relationship in advance and see if it's possible to work stuff out? Is it threatening and manipulative for me to bring up the possibility of ending our relationship if they rely on me financially or in some other way? What if we have shared obligations like children? Am I stuck here until they're 18?\n\nYes there are situations in which bringing up ending a relationship is a threat and is manipulative and is abusive. But that's not inherently the case and that's not inherently the case even when the stakes are really high. \n What made putting divorce on the table here a threat?\n\nAnd why are we automatically assuming that the husband has more of any kind of power in this relationship than the wife does? Because other than being more privileged by gender we'd literally do not know anything else about them. The wife could be the breadwinner, or could have personal wealth to fall back on. Maybe the wife owns the home outright and it was bought via her personal wealth before the relationship or she personally inherited it. We know absolutely nothing about their relative wealth and power and earning income or anything at all except for one instance where the husband is socially privileged and the wife is not and that is gender. Given that we don't know anything about their races or ethnicities or any other identities he could still be marginalized in a bunch of ways that she isn't. I really don't understand how any of this has anything to do with weather simply bringing up divorce as an option is a threat\n\nDivorce can be a threat to leave someone penniless and destitute but it isn't inherently. The person both has to have that power in the first place and then has to actually use it that way. They could have easily negotiated an amicable split that was handled by lawyers where child support and alimony and a million other issues were given a legal protection\n\nAnd if his hands were legally tied and he couldn't adopt Charlotte, no, he absolutely cannot protect or help her in the same ways. Fighting to get an abused child out of their bio-parents house is a lot harder when you cannot provide an alternative. If you do succeed then they are going to foster care. unless they get lucky with a good family who wants to adopt them, they remain a foster child until they hit 18 or until their biological parents get them back. You can't even offer them the same kind of legal protections much less a safe and loving home that is a consistent environment, etc. you can offer to pay for things like therapists and other stuff but you can't force the issue\n\nHe wanted to adopt Charlotte and offer her a consistent living environment and unconditional love and support and everything she needs to thrive and legal protection. That meant that his only options were adopting her with his wife or getting a divorce. Insisting that his wife adopt Charlotte and not giving her a choice in the matter would have been abusive absolutely. So it's weird that you're insisting that the option where the wife has a choice as to whether or not she becomes a parent again is the abusive one. And you're arguing that in lieu of that and abused child could remain in a much more precarious legal physical and emotional state\n\nWhy exactly are you so suspicious of the husband potentially being abusive when you're literally advocating for a child to be exposed to more abuse?", "As a child of divorce saying that divorce is \"trow away\" your family is so weird to me. He never said the niece wasn't being called out by her behavior, he says he is always correcting her behavior and working on the root of It in theraphy. She was wrong, he never denied that. His daugher was also being a brat and disrespectuful at her mom.\nHe IS working on the problem but It takes time. His wife, an adult, saying a disgusting thing for the child is the focus here and more urgente because she made a damage she can't undone. Just because he thinks that IS worse, doesn't mean he isn't doing anything about his niece's behavior, this is just an unfair assumption.", "Yeah just fuck Chloe \ud83e\udd2e", "Ooo, I missed that! So basically her choice was adoption or divorce? Well, that changes everything.", "It's hardly one spat. Did you read the original story plus the update? This has been ongoing. Chloe is being terrorized by this kid.", "Exactly.\n\nI have no skin in this game. It's OP's life. I know my own personal opinion of him and his actions and his wife and her actions.  But there's so much more to every story than just these minute snapshots posted on AITA with obvious bias towards the self.", "It\u2019s not at all an unfair assumption based simply on the way he speaks about the entire thing. But ok.\n\n\n- also going to tack on that you probably don\u2019t have the most unbiased opinion because you are a child of divorce. Just because your experience went one way does not mean that\u2019s how every child of divorce is going  to feel.", "Everything with you from the start is Charlotte Charlotte Charlotte. You\u2019ve done zero reflection on your or Charlotte\u2019s role in any of this. You don\u2019t give a crap about Chloe let alone your wife.", "It changes nothing. OP said he was going to adopt Charlotte and gave his wife a choice. She chose to stay with him knowing what that would entail. He was upfront and told her what would happen with either choice", "Certainly doesn\u2019t change everything.", "Yeah that makes it okay for this grown woman to threaten to send a child back to her abusive parents.", "That's what I was thinking I don't see this last thing anytime you have to give ultimatum it's not going to last", "I read one incident of Charlotte be a smarmy know it all. Yeah that sucks, if I told you about the things my brother did to me, my comment would get deleted. He was angry and violent and even as an adult I was terrified of him. Charlotte can be reprimanded and taught not to be a jerk. You know what happens when you tell someone like my late brother to stop? NOTHING.\n\n\nCorrection, they've had some arguments, why is the automatic assumption that Charlotte is an evil monster? You are making this kid out to be a serial killer, she's not. She's a traumatized kid. What do you think op should do? Put in her foster care and shrug his shoulders?", "Remember, he was willing to do so at the start. He told his wife he would divorce her if she didn't go along with the adoption.\n\nImagine how that made the other kid feel. And then when the girl moves in, she's verbally combative, abusive and gets away with it.", "I think everyone is forgetting the fact that divorce also means shared custody.  And I\u2019m assuming that if\u2019s takin in his niece he\u2019s also you to fight for at least 50% custody, so her choice was between an adoption she didn\u2019t want and divorce and losing 50% custody her daughter.", "People trying to make OP a villain for taking his niece who was being abused is nuts. I mean, maybe OP wouldn't want to be with a partner who wasn't willing to help a child in his family and that's ok!", "Well, no, but it does explain why she might be more frustrated with her.", "Yes. He's failing his daughter, wife and niece. His first priority should have been his existing family. Other arrangements should have been made for this girl. He is not equipped for any of this. And judging by all the stuff he posted on reddit he has his head in the sand that this big mess is going to work out. It's not. This is all going to blow up in his face.\n\nAnd I'm sorry you had a shitty growing up. I had a very chaotic home life as well. Didn't see or talk to either of my parents after I left home for college until I went to their funerals.", "Also this has nothing to do with moral ground?? I could give a shit about the morality of it - I just don't want an already severely traumatized child to have to go through more abuse", "I have never as an adult weaponized a child's trauma against them. Correct.", "So being miserable and saying traumatizing things to an abused child is the best option?", "Sure but it's still her problem, she chose to stay and adopt this kid, she had a choice, he did the right thing by giving her a clear way out if she didn't want this kid, now she has to assume her decision or ask for a divorce but treating this child like she did is just inexcusable.", "I'm not saying he's handling it right she needs intensive therapy and he needs to treat this kid like his actual kid. She needs to be told no. And sent to her room. She needs logical NON ABUSIVE consequences for her actions. All kids do.\n\nI'm m asking why this abuse victim is being treated like an evil soulless monster. She's not. Abuse victims shouldn't be expected to be perfect to deserve empathy.", "That wasn\u2019t my question and yes it is moral high ground when you are shitting on op trying to actually do something good about his family and redirecting the conversation anytime anyone call you out. My question was have you NEVER done anything wrong to be able to have such an opinion and how did you become so perfect to commit no wrongs? Since you know so much better and are advocating about how op can be a better dad, please enlighten us all on how you manage to never hurt anyone so we can become as perfect as you. Since you hate seeing more traumatized kids, seriously please tell us your method of causing no harm so we can all be as idealized as you are."]}
