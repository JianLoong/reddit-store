She wanted to be a Playboy Bunny and me to be Hugh Hefner. Jane went to a pregame with her girlfriends and I couldn't go \"because the host didn't know me.\" I was twiddling my thumbs at home and an old highschool friend, Molly, FaceTimed me, asked me what I was up to and when I told her she said I deserved better treatment than what Jane was giving me and invited me to a smaller party with her friends. I agreed.\n\nWell, another high school friend, Alexa, was at this party. We were really close in school and hooked up a few times, but it never went anywhere (though many people even strangers would ask us if we were dating). Alexa has also had a boyfriend since around the same time Jane and I started dating.\n\nAfter waiting for hours, Jane was finally done with the pregame and I got an Uber for her, but she was super fucked up when she got there, much more than everyone else at the party. Jane was mad that I wasn't in costume & I told her why. She calmed down and we went back to the party and chatted with everyone and played some games for a while.\n\nJane was clearly really horny and trying to make out every second. She had been smoking cigs, which I'd told her I didn't like due to my father dying from cancer. When I rejected her, she started trying to grab my dick (over the pants). I told her to stop, and she started getting mad at me. Alexa told Jane to respect my boundaries and others present, but Jane got really catty, so I decided it was time to leave, hugged my friends goodbye, and called an Uber home.\n\nIn the uber I asked her why she was so plastered and rude. She blamed it taking a vicodin. In the past I've explicitly told her I don't want to be around her if she does that and I won't support or enable her taking painkillers and drinking.\n\nFinally we get home around 2 AM, and I'm exhausted from all the bullshit and I have work at 9 AM.  But Jane is grabbing me all over and trying to have sex. I told her I didn't want to have sex and and she exploded. Yelling that I make her feel insecure & ugly. I tried to reason with her, but she wouldn't stop and ended up waking my step-dad up, who told us to take it outside. \n\nOutside and she starts screaming at me and says \"Why don't you just go fuck Alexa!\" I told Jane that I want to be with her and that Alexa has a boyfriend. She responded with \"I see the fucking way you guys look at each other, I know you want to fuck her!\" At this point my neighbor wakes up and yells \"Some of us have work in the morning!\" (ironic). So we went back inside and used inside voices. I told her I'd drive her home because we aren't going to work this out tonight. She said \"Fuck that, I'm going to walk home.\" Her house is over 5 miles away and at this point it was like 3:30 AM.\n\nI finally snapped and told her, \"If you walk out that door, don't bother contacting me ever again.\" \n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1694222417, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16dsd3r/aita_for_giving_my_20m_gf_18f_an_ultimatum/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She also didn't respect your boundaries about not having sex or being touched. Even though she's drunk, it's still a red flag to me.

She sounds insecure, self medicating with pills/alcohol. This will be a toxic relationship if you continue. If possible though, so that she can work on herself and be a healthier more functioning adult in the future, you could take the time to explain to her when you\u2019re both sober the reasons why her behaviour isn\u2019t okay. \u201cYou had me wait around while you got wasted, tried to grope me in public, accused me of having feelings for someone else, and then accused me of finding you ugly when I didn\u2019t want to sleep with you after all that.

If you let her walk did you try to get anything else to pick her up?", "I feel like she was trying to be all up on you because you guys were around Alexa and she obviously feels insecure about it. And the way you were dissing her and then the audacity that Alexa said anything at all even tho it isn't her relationship probably made her feel worse. She probably just wanted you to reciprocate those actions to make her feel better about the situation. I mean it's not your fault technically but you should definitely address it if you don't like Alexa and if nothing will happen again. Tbh you're lucky cause if it was me, we wouldn't be at that party and my man would know better than to hang out with Alexa. But then again my man would've went with me to the pregame. Idk these are just my thoughts. She was obviously jealous so I'm just giving you a jealous person's perspective.", "YTA You are still with her", "So you went to a party a friend invited you to and hung out with a chick you used to hook up with and then you told your drunk girlfriend this info and now your surprised she flipped the way she did?

Here's the thing - some people can have a few drinks, even get drunk, act normal, go home, laugh, and then sleep it off. But there are others, who can't stop at one or two. Who get overly emotional when they drink too much and do/say shit that isn't so easy to take back the next day. Those are the unfortunate among us (I'm one, I know). Those of us have to either learn to drink only a few drinks and never to excess or we have to give up drinking altogether. Your gf is at a crossroads. She has to learn to control the drinking or she'll end up needing to completely give it up. It sucks. I have sympathy. I'm lucky that I was able to figure out how to alternate between alcohol and soda water/sprite in a cocktail glass with a lime so no one's the wiser and then you don't get so drunk you act like an idiot. \n\nSo NTA. This sucks for you. I hope your gf is able to get her drinking under control. Unfortunately, she's the only one who can make that happen. You made the right call. It's completely reasonable to require that your SO doesn't turn into an irrational lunatic every time they have a drink.", "NTA. But she\u2019s 18. You\u2019re 20. Go have fun.

I've maintained my position that I wasn't the asshole to her, just wanted other peoples perspective. I know that many people have problems and I see her potential to be a good partner, but I'm coming to understand I can't draw it out of her. I still think that I'm not going to find anyone who is flawless so I try to be understanding and empathetic, rather than throw something away from a singular incident.", "She goes to parties without me, but if I go to one without her it's always a huge deal.

What would you think?", "She needs to grow up and act her age and not her shoe size", "Don't date potential, date people. Anyone you date will be a flawed human, yes. But can you think of any flawed humans you know (can be like family, platonic friends, etc) who you enjoy spending time with, feel safe with, and who make you a better version of yourself by being in your life? Who if one of you hurts the others feelings or you have a disagreement, you can usually resolve it by having a calm discussion where you each treat the other with compassion and curiosity, and sincerely apologize if one of you harmed the other? That's the kind of flawed human that in the right context could be good relationship material\n\nIf you need to do major \"fixes\" to a person to make them into a good partner, and them continuing to exist as they are is hurtful/dangerous/unsatisfying/bad in your eyes, it's not healthy for either of you. For the \"project partner\" being thought of in that way like they're not good enough can be really condescending/hurtful/stressful. And the \"project manager\" is taking on a role they can't actually fulfill, bc real change comes from within. \n\nThink of it like buying a house where you don't have and can never get the kind of capital to do major renovation work. You'll never find the perfect house - and yeah it can be good to learn to appreciate or at least accept a slightly annoying commute, some questionable wall paper choices, or a bedroom you wish was a bit bigger. But would you sign up to live in a house with a massive termite infestation? Or aspestos in the attic? Or water draining into the basement causing a big crack to the foundation? \n\nTldr: pick the flaws you'd be willing to live with long term. The only \"project\" you can successfully take on is you", "It has been said on this sub many times before: You date the current them, not their potential because it may never be realized.\n\nYou won\u2019t find anyone flawless but you sure don\u2019t have to put up with immaturity, abuse, sexual assaults, and childish tantrums.", ">She goes to parties without me, but if I go to one without her it's always a huge deal\n\nWell that's not cool. All the more reason you're better off ending this.", "Why are you with her again? NTA but this girl doesn\u2019t respect you or your boundaries. You can, indeed, do better.", "Ok, then why are you asking this question now? It seems to me like you are trying to justify breaking up with her. Dude, you need no justification. Switch roles, what if you had done that to her? Just because you\u2019re a M, doesn\u2019t make what she did any less abusive. And if she\u2019s still being that \u201cterritorial\u201d, get out. It will only get worse. \nI\u2019m sorry that happened and I wish you luck.", "that's toxic AF brother, you need to sit her down and establish proper boundaries on this.\n\nJust flip the roles and think how bad and abusive it is when a boyfriend in this case is extremely territorial over his GF and thinks any dude she interacts with wants to fuck her.", "Info. Drifted away naturally as some friendships do or due to your gf causing so much drama each time you saw them? Cos if it's the second, that's not a good look on her.", "If this is a once off and you do love her, you probably could try and look at this as someone who had an adverse reaction to a bad mix of alcohol/pills who does definitely need some therapy. Hopefully she can see things from your point of view when she\u2019s more clear headed and is embarrassed by her behaviour.", "NTA you did everything in your power to help her, and she sexuality harassed you when you weren't into it. You drove her home and avoided negatives of her going home alone.", "Wait what do you mean? I think it\u2019s wrong for you to bring your partner around someone you have fucked in the past (especially because she didn\u2019t even know about it). She felt the vibes that they like each other and was acting out because she felt insecure. If the genders were reversed, I would feel the same way.", "Yeah cause it\u2019s right to hang out with people you\u2019ve slept with in the past with your partner right there. That\u2019s disrespectful. She was wrong to act out like that.

It\u2019s a crazy coincidence how she said it looks like you and Alexa want each other and you guys have hooked up and she doesn\u2019t even know that. And now that you said that you never told her, gives me a feeling y\u2019all were probably giving off that vibe.", "Idk who you are so idk why you calling me bestie. I just said it wasn\u2019t his fault. I\u2019m saying why she was acting like that. I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s possessive. We\u2019re talking about some chick he fucked, not someone who he is innocently friends with. And if you think it\u2019s ok for your man to hang out with girls he\u2019s slept with, you\u2019re not secure- you\u2019re just dumb.", "But did she walk out? Even if she didn\u2019t I hope she\u2019s your ex by now Lol NTA", "Had me in the first half, not gonna lie.", "I totally get your point. Since this happened I don't think she's been taking painkillers and drinking, and it's something that has only happened twice before. But I would definitely tell my friends to walk regardless", "Most of the time I just end up picking her up when she's pretty drunk and her girlfriends & whoever at the party always tell me she never stops talking about me and how much she loves me. But I just don't understand why she doesn't want me with her?", "Not harassed, grabbing is assault.", "Nope I drove her home", "For - what like ten months now? - sober Jane has defended the behavior of drunk pain killer Jane. They're the same Jane.\n\nI'd gently encourage you to take a step back from focusing on her - why she did that, why she keeps defending it, whether or when she'll do more of it, how to get her to understand or care how it affected you, etc - and take a moment to center yourself. Answering any of those questions about her won't make her behavior ok, and nothing you do can \"fix\" her into a more mature and respectful human than she already is.\n\nHere's a question to get you thinking: if Jane stayed exactly the way she is - not necessarily doing this crap again or more frequently, but also just as unapologetic and the same maturity level and communication/relationship repair skills, how much longer could you see the relationship lasting? And how would you feel about the prospect of continuing a long term relationship with Jane as she is today?", "You're WAY overthinking this. She's a trainwreck and a drama queen. Maybe she doesn't want you with her because she's using drugs etc and she knows you wouldn't approve? It doesn't matter, this ain't the one, move on.", "Because something better may come along."]}
