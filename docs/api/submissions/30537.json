Very (very!) soft YTA, not for your decision but for how you approached it.\n\nThis is your sister\u2019s partner and the father of her child. You must realize that not inviting him means she can\u2019t attend, but you framed it as though you still expect her to. That\u2019s insensitive and hurtful, even if your reasoning for not wanting him in your home is valid. \n\nI do think it\u2019s reasonable to not welcome him into your home, but please make it very clear to your sister that it\u2019s not because of his record, but because you have reason to believe he stole from your parents. Even if that was in the past, he has shown that he is willing to steal from your family, hasn\u2019t taken responsibility for it, and thus has yet to earn your trust.\n\nI think your best way forward is to suggest a change in venue; say you\u2019re happy to still do the cooking and prep, but you\u2019re uncomfortable having him in your home so it would be better if your parents or sister host. If a change in venue isn\u2019t possible, then you have a difficult decision to make: do you distrust him enough that you\u2019re willing to end your relationship with your sister? It\u2019s okay if that\u2019s the case, but you should realize that\u2019s almost certainly the choice you\u2019re making. They are currently a package deal, and that may never change.\n\nAs a brief advocacy note, I do want to say that a *massive* factor in recidivism is stuff like this. I\u2019m involved in research to reduce recidivism, and a quote I heard from a community partner on one project was \u201cPeople aren\u2019t leaving great lives to commit crimes.\u201d Most criminal charges come either from racial discrimination (unjust charges from a racist system), or desperation (people who cannot see a way to survive without the criminal activity). Some of the absolute best, most generous and empathetic people I know have criminal records. They were involved in crime due to desperate circumstances where they didn\u2019t see another option; support systems after incarceration (often people like your sister) helped them to completely rebuild their lives, and they are not the same people they once were. Another powerful quote was \u201c(when you have a record,) you have to earn trust a thousand times before you *might* actually receive it;\u201d feeling like people will only ever see you as a criminal makes it very hard for people to keep doing all the hard work to crawl out of those desperate circumstances, especially because having a record makes it *incredibly* difficult to find employment. I have no idea whether your sister\u2019s boyfriend is still an asshole; but I hope you\u2019re open to accepting him if he does show he\u2019s a different person now. You don\u2019t ever have to like him \u2014 plenty of people just don\u2019t like their sibling\u2019s partners \u2014 but do give him a chance to just be \u201cthe sister\u2019s boyfriend you don\u2019t like\u201d instead of \u201cthe guy with a criminal record.\u201d", "NTA.

The parents stuff going missing 2 years ago is completely circumstantial, it doesn\u2019t sound like the parents have any issues there so I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s the ONLY incident which does in fact mean that OP is completely judging him based off of the record. \n\nDoes she get to choose who is allowed in her house? Yes of course. But her choice will also have consequences and more than likely that will mean loosing her sister. \n\nI too would also welcome him to my table. Just like I have many family and friends who have criminal records from their past because of either dumb choices or being in tough spots and they did the only thing they could think of.

If you want to ignore all the stories on Reddit categorically then fine, I could give a dozen or more examples from my own life. A younger brother stealing from his brothers' friends.
