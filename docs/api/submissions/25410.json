Your house, and it was not disclosed.  The woman should not have spread her husband's ashes in a place that she would no longer own or perhaps no longer have access to.  I wouldn't say she's an AH, but she made some bad choices and has no right to be upset with you.", "NTA she didn\u2019t think about her husband for all these 5 months during your ownership of the house so what gives her the right to get upset at you when it\u2019s ENTIRELY her fault for being so careless she\u2019s the AH.", "OK, you already know you're not an asshole for doing this **unknowingly.** Come on.", "NTA \n\nIf nobody told you, you weren\u2019t to know.

She had the option not to sell it.", "Of course you're NTA. You didn't know. And this is exactly why you don't scatter ashes at a home even if you own it.", "NTA you had no prior knowledge. Even if you did something like that should've been taken care of by her or family. IE they should've moved the flower bed or taken it.", "You feel bad because you care about a stranger and her pain, that's great. That's a normal feeling. But NTA-- you wouldn't even have been if you knew and changed the garden. The woman has to grieve this change and it sucks, but it's not your fault. If you want, don't have to, ask her if there's anything you can do now to help. Is there another way to help her grieving and distress. Again, don't have to, but I'd feel bad too and would want to help if I could. ETA: But don't accept any kind of jerk behavior, you don't have to be her victim b/c of her loss.", "NTA-Stop beating yourself up for something that was entirely out of your control. Like you said, you did nothing different than every other person does when they buy a home and to expect that the garden would stay where it was when it was no longer theirs is absurd.", "NTA. You didn't know. Even if you did know, it wouldn't be a definite strike against you, since it is your house after all, but given that you didn't know there's really no argument to be made.", "NTA\n\nAnd quite frankly, you would be going quite a bit out of your way to respect her even if she had asked. She sold the house.", "NTA.  This whole thing is definitely on the previous homeowner.  If she wanted her husband's ashes and the flowers, she should have 1) told you about them and 2) made the sale contingent on her taking it all with her.  It wasn't reasonable for her to assume you'd never make changes to your own yard.", "110% NTA. Let me say that again\u2026 NTA. This is an inappropriate thing for an ex-owner to do. I will admit I occasionally check on my old homes\u2026online. I do NOT drive by. I do NOT contact them by phone or mail and ask to come visit my old home. I just check Zillow to see if they sold it and for how much lol. If that garden were that important she never should have moved. It\u2019s not your job to hold on to her dead husband and \u201chis flowers\u201d. It\u2019s not ok for her to think you should.

How were you supposed to know if she didn't tell you when you bought the house?", "NTA, how could you possibly know?", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't feel bad about it, no one said anything and honestly, why would she think the new owner wouldn't make changes if they didn't agree to?", "NTA. Also, why would she sell a house that had her dead husband's remains on it? Why would she spread her dead husband's remains on someone else's property? This woman makes no sense.", "NTA.  This is something she should have thought about when she spread his ashes.  She also could have arranged to have the soil removed and saved when she sold the property.", "NTA. You didn't know! I don't know what she expected to happen when she sold the property. Even if she told you about it, she had no guarantee that you'd be a kind person who cared about her attachment to the flower bed - the  new owner has the right to make changes no matter how the former owner feels about it. She should have moved the flower bed with her if she was that attached to it.", "You didn't know and it's not their house anymore.\n\nNTA", "I mean... EVEN if you knew... it's your house now. You can do whatever you want with it.\n\nIf this lady didn't want her late husband's ashes disturbed, then she should have kept the house.\n\nNTA.", "NTA How the hell were you supposed to know? She should have taken the flower bed or just not spread the ashes when she was inevitably gonna sell the house.", "NTA.\n\nYou literally had no way of knowing and had no obligation to preserve the yard exactly the way they had it set up. \n\nSucks for the lady that she lost her husband and a symbolic place to mourn him, but you aren't a mind reader. \n\nif you really want to go the extra mile for this lady maybe set up a smaller flower bed somewhere on the property that fits w/ your current yard and invite her to spread any ashes she might still have left. beyond thats there nothing you can really do, and even that is wayyyy above and beyond what any reasonable person could expect from someone", "NAH. You are not psychic and you didn\u2019t knowingly purchase a graveyard, so you\u2019re definitely NTA. She is out of line, but I vote NAH anyhow.  Here\u2019s why I cut her slack:\n\n* I was  widowed at 26 and can confirm that grief is freakin\u2019 hard. It sneaks up on you at the most unexpected times, and the pain is very deep and very real. I assume it was that dark, primal, aching part of her that was furious, and that she was probably really more angry with her husband for dying and with herself for whatever series of events that transpired that made her sell the home where her husband\u2019s ashes are than she was with you. She probably realizes (or will realize) she was being ridiculous and is embarrassed. She may reach out to apologize, but if she doesn\u2019t, she probably wants to.\n\n* My first thought was that she shouldn\u2019t have scattered her ashes there or shouldn\u2019t have sold the house. But she probably didn\u2019t plan to ever sell the house when she scattered them there. But the aftermath of being widowed, at least for me, made everything topsy-turvy. I was shocked to find my finances became a mess as I dealt with bills I never expected to have, and I ended up having to move 6 months later. \n* She may have asked the agent to tell you the ashes were there; in which case, she thought you knew. I can easily imagine an agent saying \u201csure, I\u2019ll let the prospective buyer know\u201d to placate her, and then not actually saying it because they either forgot or just thought it was a little creepy and wouldn\u2019t ever be an issue. I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t realize the old owner would ask to visit!\n\nRegardless, you are definitely NTA. You have every right to landscape as you please, but you actually sound like a really compassionate person, to be honest. If she does call back to apologize, or if you reach out to her, maybe ask her if she\u2019d like to put a little garden stone (not a headstone, but something the size of a paving stone or smaller) on the property? Of course, you aren\u2019t even obligated to do that and if she plans to come visit often, I wouldn\u2019t. But if she\u2019s not actually crazy, just knowing it\u2019s there could bring her peace of mind. \n\nNow that I think about it, if you do decide to do something, an even better alternative for both of you could be to give her  some of the dirt from the property in a vial and tell her it\u2019s dirt from that garden. They make necklaces to carry small amounts of ashes and she could keep it in something like that. That would keep her from visiting your home and you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the stone getting moved or broken. \n\nAgain, these are just suggested acts if kindness that would have helped me if I were in her shoes\u2014you are in no way obligated to speak to her or do anything for her.", "NTA. We sprinkled some of my Bella Nonna's ashes into the garden beds at her house near Cape Cod after the house was no longer in possession of our family (ownership reverted back to her late husband's family) because that's what she wanted. The family they sold the house to tore out the flower beds (and just left dirt, it was really dumb), but that's no great tragedy because the moment she stopped existing on earth, they were no longer her flowers or her flower bed. She was placed to rest in the places she loved most, but the past tense is really important here. \n\nYour home's former owner may have some feelings about her husband's resting place, but quite frankly it's none of her business. Past tense is important here too. The flowers served their purpose to put her grief and mourning into a specific place, but it was also her duty to maintain the space that's important to her. \n\nForgive yourself, you cannot hold yourself to the standards of malice when you did something out of ignorance. Give her some grace too, she's clearly mourning. Maybe if you're feeling very generous, invite her over to plant a tree or some flowers in the same area where the flower garden was, but you're under absolutely no obligation.", "She\u2019s mad at her lack of foresight. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA . If ypu dobt k ow, you dont know. Its your house not a memorial garden.", "NTA. Even if you DID know, you would have well within your right and standard of decency to get rid of it.  You sell a place you accept people will change it, she has no right to try and guilt trip you in to accepting her vision for your proprty. What gives her the right to try and use your garden as a mausoleum? Not every gardener wants to stick their hands in and dig around in human remains so a little heads up would have been a nice thing as well.", "NTA. You had no idea and you have every right to do with the yard as you please as it now belongs to you. You would still have the right even if you knew about this, and I'd question her decision to spread her husband's ashes in a place she decides to sell. It's an unfortunate situation but you're absolutely NTA.", "NTA. Frankly, you are generous of heart to even consider it. \nMany people would be mad and creeped out to not have been told. \n\nIn fact, I would bet you were not told specifically so you wouldn't back out of the sale over it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In fact, she shouldn't have placed cremains somewhere that could even potentially have been disturbed.\n\nMy mom put it into her Will that after she passed away she wanted her ashes scattered on a specific place on a piece of property she owned.  The problem is that we were going to sell that property so if we wanted to visit her final resting place, it would have involved getting permission in perpetuity from future owners.  Also, the spot would have been an ideal place to build a house due to the view of the valley & mountains on the other side.\n\nWe kids decided not to burden anyone else with that and we instead spread her ashes on a protected mountainside that will never be developed.  So, Mom still has her view and we can visit without inconveniencing anyone.", "NTA. Nobody told you a damn thing, and in all honesty, the former owner shouldn't have sold the house in hindsight.\n\nPS.: Personally, I wouldn't let the former owner visit my yard. No way. Again, she shouldn't have sold the house if she was so attached to it.", "NTA.\n\nYou can't be held responsible for something you have no knowledge of.

You said it yourself, you didn't know. Do not feel guilty about this. Part of her reaction is buyer/seller's remorse. It can happen months after the transaction. She chose to sell, for whatever reason, and now feels guilty that she left behind her husband. Moving forward, don't take her calls. You don't owe her anything. The house is legally yours.

If someone needs that connection and bond with the deceased person they need to put them somewhere they would have access to.", "Heck I don't think it's even off base to talk to the current homeowner if they're out in the yard when you're in the area. I grew up in a house that was built by my father, grandfather and uncle. It was sold over 30 years ago and has had three owners since then. The lady we sold it to was lovely and we kept in contact with her. After she moved, we didn't know the 2nd owners. When it sold again, we happened to see the new owners outside the house and introduced ourselves. They were very kind and gracious to us, but refused our request to take a look inside the house. We understood and accepted their answer. It's really that simple.", "Eh, knocking isn\u2019t even that bad as long as you are entirely okay with being turned away. I\u2019ve done it once, because my dad and his siblings had handprints in the concrete of the patio of my grandparents old house that I wanted a picture of, and the backyard was fenced off. One person living there said to give them a minute (presumably to check with other residents if it was okay to let me into the back for the picture), and let me through. But if I had been told no, I would\u2019ve just walked away.", "When I sold my parents house (outside the city limits - so county land) I told the realtor the family pets were buried under/near-by some bushes.  The couple who bought the house had pets so I think they understood.  If the family pet remains are still there I do not know.\n\nThe yard had trails from the dogs and the flagstone / bricked front door enclosure had dark areas from the dogs hair oil due to laying in the same spot.  Their dogs used the same trails and spots when they showed me the house a year later.  I felt I picked a winner.", "That\u2019s so sweet."]}
