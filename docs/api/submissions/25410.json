IE they should've moved the flower bed or taken it.", "You feel bad because you care about a stranger and her pain, that's great. That's a normal feeling.

If you want, don't have to, ask her if there's anything you can do now to help. Is there another way to help her grieving and distress. Again, don't have to, but I'd feel bad too and would want to help if I could. ETA: But don't accept any kind of jerk behavior, you don't have to be her victim b/c of her loss.", "NTA-Stop beating yourself up for something that was entirely out of your control. Like you said, you did nothing different than every other person does when they buy a home and to expect that the garden would stay where it was when it was no longer theirs is absurd.", "NTA. You didn't know. Even if you did know, it wouldn't be a definite strike against you, since it is your house after all, but given that you didn't know there's really no argument to be made.", "NTA\n\nAnd quite frankly, you would be going quite a bit out of your way to respect her even if she had asked. She sold the house.", "NTA.  This whole thing is definitely on the previous homeowner.  If she wanted her husband's ashes and the flowers, she should have 1) told you about them and 2) made the sale contingent on her taking it all with her.

I will admit I occasionally check on my old homes\u2026online. I do NOT drive by. I do NOT contact them by phone or mail and ask to come visit my old home. I just check Zillow to see if they sold it and for how much lol. If that garden were that important she never should have moved.

This is something she should have thought about when she spread his ashes.  She also could have arranged to have the soil removed and saved when she sold the property.", "NTA. You didn't know! I don't know what she expected to happen when she sold the property. Even if she told you about it, she had no guarantee that you'd be a kind person who cared about her attachment to the flower bed - the  new owner has the right to make changes no matter how the former owner feels about it.

She should have taken the flower bed or just not spread the ashes when she was inevitably gonna sell the house.", "NTA.\n\nYou literally had no way of knowing and had no obligation to preserve the yard exactly the way they had it set up. \n\nSucks for the lady that she lost her husband and a symbolic place to mourn him, but you aren't a mind reader. \n\nif you really want to go the extra mile for this lady maybe set up a smaller flower bed somewhere on the property that fits w/ your current yard and invite her to spread any ashes she might still have left. beyond thats there nothing you can really do, and even that is wayyyy above and beyond what any reasonable person could expect from someone", "NAH. You are not psychic and you didn\u2019t knowingly purchase a graveyard, so you\u2019re definitely NTA. She is out of line, but I vote NAH anyhow.  Here\u2019s why I cut her slack:\n\n* I was  widowed at 26 and can confirm that grief is freakin\u2019 hard. It sneaks up on you at the most unexpected times, and the pain is very deep and very real. I assume it was that dark, primal, aching part of her that was furious, and that she was probably really more angry with her husband for dying and with herself for whatever series of events that transpired that made her sell the home where her husband\u2019s ashes are than she was with you. She probably realizes (or will realize) she was being ridiculous and is embarrassed. She may reach out to apologize, but if she doesn\u2019t, she probably wants to.\n\n* My first thought was that she shouldn\u2019t have scattered her ashes there or shouldn\u2019t have sold the house. But she probably didn\u2019t plan to ever sell the house when she scattered them there. But the aftermath of being widowed, at least for me, made everything topsy-turvy. I was shocked to find my finances became a mess as I dealt with bills I never expected to have, and I ended up having to move 6 months later. \n* She may have asked the agent to tell you the ashes were there; in which case, she thought you knew. I can easily imagine an agent saying \u201csure, I\u2019ll let the prospective buyer know\u201d to placate her, and then not actually saying it because they either forgot or just thought it was a little creepy and wouldn\u2019t ever be an issue. I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t realize the old owner would ask to visit!\n\nRegardless, you are definitely NTA. You have every right to landscape as you please, but you actually sound like a really compassionate person, to be honest. If she does call back to apologize, or if you reach out to her, maybe ask her if she\u2019d like to put a little garden stone (not a headstone, but something the size of a paving stone or smaller) on the property? Of course, you aren\u2019t even obligated to do that and if she plans to come visit often, I wouldn\u2019t. But if she\u2019s not actually crazy, just knowing it\u2019s there could bring her peace of mind. \n\nNow that I think about it, if you do decide to do something, an even better alternative for both of you could be to give her  some of the dirt from the property in a vial and tell her it\u2019s dirt from that garden. They make necklaces to carry small amounts of ashes and she could keep it in something like that. That would keep her from visiting your home and you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the stone getting moved or broken. \n\nAgain, these are just suggested acts if kindness that would have helped me if I were in her shoes\u2014you are in no way obligated to speak to her or do anything for her.", "NTA. We sprinkled some of my Bella Nonna's ashes into the garden beds at her house near Cape Cod after the house was no longer in possession of our family (ownership reverted back to her late husband's family) because that's what she wanted. The family they sold the house to tore out the flower beds (and just left dirt, it was really dumb), but that's no great tragedy because the moment she stopped existing on earth, they were no longer her flowers or her flower bed. She was placed to rest in the places she loved most, but the past tense is really important here. \n\nYour home's former owner may have some feelings about her husband's resting place, but quite frankly it's none of her business. Past tense is important here too. The flowers served their purpose to put her grief and mourning into a specific place, but it was also her duty to maintain the space that's important to her. \n\nForgive yourself, you cannot hold yourself to the standards of malice when you did something out of ignorance. Give her some grace too, she's clearly mourning. Maybe if you're feeling very generous, invite her over to plant a tree or some flowers in the same area where the flower garden was, but you're under absolutely no obligation.", "She\u2019s mad at her lack of foresight. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA . If ypu dobt k ow, you dont know. Its your house not a memorial garden.", "NTA. Even if you DID know, you would have well within your right and standard of decency to get rid of it.  You sell a place you accept people will change it, she has no right to try and guilt trip you in to accepting her vision for your proprty. What gives her the right to try and use your garden as a mausoleum? Not every gardener wants to stick their hands in and dig around in human remains so a little heads up would have been a nice thing as well.", "NTA.

In fact, she shouldn't have placed cremains somewhere that could even potentially have been disturbed.\n\nMy mom put it into her Will that after she passed away she wanted her ashes scattered on a specific place on a piece of property she owned.  The problem is that we were going to sell that property so if we wanted to visit her final resting place, it would have involved getting permission in perpetuity from future owners.  Also, the spot would have been an ideal place to build a house due to the view of the valley & mountains on the other side.\n\nWe kids decided not to burden anyone else with that and we instead spread her ashes on a protected mountainside that will never be developed.

Even if you knew,  why would she expect you to let her into your yard anytime she wishes.", "YTA for making me read such an asinine post.", "NTA how could you be? You did not know.", "NTA this actually happened to my family where my great grandparents ashes were scattered. The house was never supposed to be sold but my grandpas brother was a greedy ass and forced the sale. The new owners ripped out the rose garden where they were scattered. I'm sure they didn't know. It sucks but there's nothing that can be done. I'm not mad at the new owners. I'm still mad at my grandpa's brother though lol it was a beautiful property and I have so many memories there. I wish I could take my kids there to watch fireworks over the river on the 4th like I did growing up.", "I hope this post/comments has made you feel better about this, hon. *No one* moves into a house and thinks \"oh shit I better keep this garden intact in case someone's ashes are in here\".", "NTA you got to put notice of human remains on properties!!! Technically your land is a cemetery, I think you can put in for reduced/eliminated property taxes?", "Y-WNBTA if you did this even after she told you.\n\nYou're double NTA for not reading her mind about it.", "NTA.  If only there were some type of small, portable pot that she could have kept some of the ashes in, instead of dumping every single one out into a flowerbed on private property that she ultimately sold.  I want to point out that this is absolutely a NTA rather than N A H because she is an idiot to dump this guilt onto you.  You have done absolutely nothing wrong.", "NTA - how could you have known? \n\nThis is the one of the reasons that cemeteries and memorials exist in the first place; public land set aside as a memorial and maintained as a place of remembrance, so that individuals don't have to manage that all on their own. \n\nMy grandmother was vehemently against the idea of a tombstone or formal memorial for herself, so we scattered her ashes in a state park which hasn't changed appreciably in a hundred years (with permission from the rangers). In the US I think it's a fault of our culture that we avoid talking about death and often don't plan or communicate well around it. When my grandparents drew up their end-of-life plans, deciding at which point in a medical emergency to not attempt revival and going over funeral wishes, it started a lot of conversations that I realized I've had with basically no one else I know.", "NTA. You\u2019re not a psychic. How were you supposed to know. Also, you bought the house at full value in a bargained for, arm\u2019s length contract. You can do whatever you want with it.", "Not your fault that nobody told you that his ashes were there tell her that directly", "They probably know, but feel very bad about it because even though they aren't an AH, they can empathize with the widow.", "You can't grant an easement to yourself. None exists here unless it was recorded on title at the time of transfer and then title insurance would have blocked the sale.", "I'm baffled that she said nothing during the sale!", "Yeah that's some bad feng shui. Here you'd be trying to live in the house you paid for and use the yard for its intended purpose, and here's the former owner hanging around treating the place as their personal graveyard. Op is very kind to consider it but its possible to be too accomodating. Maybe it would be okay to set up an annual date they can come by to mourn but they shouldn't be coming over whenever they want.", "It's more complex than that; the owner of a property cannot grant themselves an easement over it, so even in a scenario where someone else might have had an implied easement one does not exist from the owner to the subsequent purchaser.\n\nIt would need to be recorded on title, and title insurance would have flagged this at the transaction.", "When my mom passed away, I transplanted several flowers from her garden into mine since we weren\u2019t keeping her house. Eight years later and only one plant hasn\u2019t made it. All the others are still happily growing and blooming.", "I'm guessing she probably wasn't intending on selling, but ended up having to.  Or didn't think she could take some of the plants with her.", "Yeah I\u2019m kinda going on what I remember from the Bar exam and Property class lol. It\u2019s not explicitly my field, but it seemed what that person said was obviously wrong.", "Or start a passionate love affair with a younger man. It may not be love but it makes her feel alive", "This is my favorite option.", "This, among other things:  \n\n\n\"According to the same New York Times article, to zone for a burial ground, the deed of your property will make the burial grounds existence known and will restrict the burial ground itself from new ownership.\"", "Did you read the rest of it or just cherry picking to support your argument cause directly about that quote is says \" Generally speaking, the land that your loved one was buried on still belongs to you.\" So taking the whole thing in context while you live on the property if you bury remains of a family member then land where you buried them will be noted as a burial ground which is then exempt from future ownership", "I read the whole thing. Did you? Because...\n\n>So taking the whole thing in context while you live on the property if you bury remains of a family member then land where you buried them will be noted as a burial ground which is then exempt from future ownership\n\n...is not what it says at all \ud83e\udd23 A deed is a legal document transferring ownership of real estate. According to your own source, the *legal document* must make the existence of the burial grounds known. \"Generally speaking\" isn't a legal argument, and neither (according to *your* source) is \"I sprinkled ashes on some flowers and didn't tell you before you bought the house but you should have just known and now I can sue you.\" \n\nI'm sorry for the ex-homeowner and their loss, but OP did nothing wrong either legally or morally."]}
