In the first month we were seeing each other I told him a couple years back I was a surrogate and will be doing a sibling journey for the same family at some point (my Intended Parent - IP - and I discussed it at 2 weeks postpartum and I verbally agreed then I would be honored and carry again so long as I can get medically cleared when the time came). At the time he told me that was amazing I did that and would be willing to do it again. All seemed he was good with it and that was the only conversation we had until last night. When I told him my surrogate family reached out and told me they decided they will have me transfer again he was no longer supportive. His answer was \"No, you don't need the money. Babe, no. You're with me, you aren't a baby factory. We have future plans.\" \n\nAs you can tell it led to an argument where he is now trying to find a way for me to get out of being a surrogate. He's making it clear he doesn't want me to do it and that I should pick him and his feelings over my surrogacy family. We talked a little more today and he told me that while he was fine with it when we were new, and I was \"single\" he didn't think he would ever have to deal with it when we were together and now that we have gotten serious he isn't okay with it. He also said he didn't see why I couldn't understand his side as to why he isn't okay with it. I had to let him know that I will never be in his position, to be the partner of someone who could/is a surrogate. So I don't understand and I need him to talk more on it to help me see what the issue is.\n\nIn my eyes, nothing changes really changes outside of I no longer get a period. My pregnancies have always been easy, I don't really show till 5+ months and my IP is super chill. My contract is very bare on restrictions - literally the only one is when I'm 32 weeks and its not being allowed to go outside of a 2 hour range of the delivering hospital. \n\nPlus, I am close with my surrogacy family. We communicate with each other regularly and I get to see them often as well since we all live in the same state. They specifically wanted a surrogate who would be interested in a long term relationship and for the baby to know the surrogate since it will be pretty clear that they didn't come from their IP (they are non-uterus owners).\n\nWhile I have always gotten mixed responses when I have told people I was a surrogate, it's something I hold near and dear to my heart and I value the relationship with my bonus family. But at this point its being made pretty clear, it's my relationship with him or my surrogacy. \n\nSo...AITA for not really being willing to get out of my contract because my boyfriend isn't okay with it?\n\n\\*It should be noted I am already under contract for this sibling journey. We signed early this year and already did an initial transfer which failed. Per my contract I am committed to 3 transfers before I could choose to not continue.

He lied to you. Calling you a baby factory is insulting something you clearly put great value on - helping your IP complete their family. You are doing a very noble thing, and he is trying to denigrate it. \n\nA five month relationship doesn't give him a veto over your choice to be a surrogate.

He showed his support by showing up to meetings and being part of conversations and listening to all of the plans and arrangements that are in place to protect both surrogate and IPs and make it as safe and healthy as it could be.

It wasn't for me and most people I know who have done it as in Australia all surrogacy arrangements must be altruistic. But even when you can receive financial compensation it's not the main motivating factor. There are some things you can't pay for and can't quantify in terms of money and helping people become parents is one of them. The relationship you have with your surro-fam is another.

Will he pay for whatever the judgment amount is?", "Let me get this straight: I despise the whole idea of surrogacy and I think it\u2019s a massive exploitation of women.
