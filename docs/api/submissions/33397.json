{"id": 33397, "submission_id": "18mk7zn", "title": "AITA for not getting out of my surrogacy contract when my bf is not onboard?", "selftext": "I (33f) and my boyfriend (39m) have been together coming up on 5 months. In the first month we were seeing each other I told him a couple years back I was a surrogate and will be doing a sibling journey for the same family at some point (my Intended Parent - IP - and I discussed it at 2 weeks postpartum and I verbally agreed then I would be honored and carry again so long as I can get medically cleared when the time came). At the time he told me that was amazing I did that and would be willing to do it again. All seemed he was good with it and that was the only conversation we had until last night. When I told him my surrogate family reached out and told me they decided they will have me transfer again he was no longer supportive. His answer was \"No, you don't need the money. Babe, no. You're with me, you aren't a baby factory. We have future plans.\" \n\nAs you can tell it led to an argument where he is now trying to find a way for me to get out of being a surrogate. He's making it clear he doesn't want me to do it and that I should pick him and his feelings over my surrogacy family. We talked a little more today and he told me that while he was fine with it when we were new, and I was \"single\" he didn't think he would ever have to deal with it when we were together and now that we have gotten serious he isn't okay with it. He also said he didn't see why I couldn't understand his side as to why he isn't okay with it. I had to let him know that I will never be in his position, to be the partner of someone who could/is a surrogate. So I don't understand and I need him to talk more on it to help me see what the issue is.\n\nIn my eyes, nothing changes really changes outside of I no longer get a period. My pregnancies have always been easy, I don't really show till 5+ months and my IP is super chill. My contract is very bare on restrictions - literally the only one is when I'm 32 weeks and its not being allowed to go outside of a 2 hour range of the delivering hospital. \n\nPlus, I am close with my surrogacy family. We communicate with each other regularly and I get to see them often as well since we all live in the same state. They specifically wanted a surrogate who would be interested in a long term relationship and for the baby to know the surrogate since it will be pretty clear that they didn't come from their IP (they are non-uterus owners).\n\nWhile I have always gotten mixed responses when I have told people I was a surrogate, it's something I hold near and dear to my heart and I value the relationship with my bonus family. But at this point its being made pretty clear, it's my relationship with him or my surrogacy. \n\nSo...AITA for not really being willing to get out of my contract because my boyfriend isn't okay with it?\n\n\\*It should be noted I am already under contract for this sibling journey. We signed early this year and already did an initial transfer which failed. Per my contract I am committed to 3 transfers before I could choose to not continue.

I could be wrong, but it sounds like you'd have more regrets breaking the contract than breaking up.", "Let\u2019s see. You\u2019ve been dating this man for approximately 100 business days and he thinks he can come in and tell you what to do with your body?  \n\nJust because he feels a certain way doesn\u2019t obligate you to change your behavior/vacate a contract to make him feel better. He\u2019s a big boy and can work through those big feels on his own. \n\nMaybe this is not the right season for the two of you to be in a relationship.", "Nta lmao you've been datjng for not even half a year and he wants to control your body?  Good thing he's showing his true colors early on so you can dump him and haven't wasted to much of your life.", "NTA - You made your plans clear upfront. He doesn\u2019t get to clutch his pearls now when he always knew this was a possibility (especially since this is only what, 4 months later?). I\u2019m sure the fact that it\u2019s actually happening makes it more of a reality for him, and it makes sense that he\u2019d have some feelings to work through. But it still isn\u2019t up to him to decide what you do with your body, especially since, again, it\u2019s not like you sprung this on him out of nowhere.", "I'm a bit fearful about the possible symbolism his opinions about what you choose to do with _your_ body has for the future of your relationship.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou made a choice before he existed in your life that has been a wonderful help to another family. And you were up front honest with him that you would be doing this again. He gets to leave if he doesn't like it, but he doesn't get to treat you like you owe him your body, your life, your sense of self, your accomplishments.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend sounds like he doesn't understand how fulfilling this surrogacy contract is for you. You've told him, multiple times, right from the beginning of this relationship and it just sounds like that's supposed to be different now that you're his property. \n\nRun, dear OP, \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA\n\nYou have an agreement with a family you're close to, which includes a legal contract, that he previously said he supportive of you fulfilling, but when it came time to actually do it he changed his tune and is trying to make you not do it?\n\nThat's manipulative BS and he is the AH. He lied to you. Calling you a baby factory is insulting something you clearly put great value on - helping your IP complete their family. You are doing a very noble thing, and he is trying to denigrate it. \n\nA five month relationship doesn't give him a veto over your choice to be a surrogate. A good partner listens to the views of their partner and considers them, but listening to and considering someone's views does **not** mean doing what they say. You get to make your own choice and he clearly doesn't like that. \n\nAlso, \"we have future plans\" after five months? Have you actually discussed 'future plans' with him or is this something he just sprung during the argument? \n\nHe might leave over this, but that doesn't sound like the worst outcome.", "NTA. If he's not on board with this you guys are not compatible. After all you are intending to maintain a relationship with the family. This is literally a part of who you are (a surrogate) and your life that he's rejecting flat out. Worse he's seems to be implying  that there is something wrong with what you're doing by referring to you as a \"baby factory\".", "NTA; he was told the score from day one. You haven\u2019t been with this guy for even half a year, and he\u2019s trying to control you. He\u2019s trying to take ownership of your body. He was never ok with it, he just thought he could change your mind.", "NTA", "Just NTA. This is a him issue, not a you or us issue. He knew about this from the start and while his feelings are valid, they are his to work out. You are committed both by a contract but more importantly by your relationship with this family you are helping.", "NTA at all, you made your choice and it is your body. He is allowed to feel some type of way but ultimately it\u2019s up to you.", "I\u2019m sorry, you carried the previous baby longer than you dated this man! He doesn\u2019t get a say on what happens with your body! NTA and it\u2019s weird he\u2019s being so controlling.", "NTA. If he nodded along when you were newly dating then had more reservations later when you got serious and it became a reality, that would be understandable. A healthy person would ask questions and share their feelings and the couple would decide if they're compatible or not.\n\nHowever, that's not what he did. The way he is talking to you and responding to this is gross and a major red flag. He doesn't get to tell you what to do. He doesn't get to shame you for being a surrogate. He doesn't get to make future plans about your body without your consent. \n\nIt's lucky he showed his true colors now, before it got too far. You deserve better OP.", "NAH. You are committed to your surrogacy; that\u2019s fine and your decision. He is uncomfortable with his partner carrying a child for another family; that is also a fine boundary to have. Unfortunately unless one of you is willing to compromise, it looks like you\u2019re just not compatible.\n\nHe may be *slightly* TA for saying he was okay with surrogacy and then going back on it, but honestly I think it\u2019s a fair thing to change your mind on as pregnancy and childbirth are absolutely a big deal no matter how you spin it.", "NAH. You signed a contract and you\u2019re legally bound to see it through. Your boyfriend is also not wrong for having not so happy feelings about you carrying another man\u2019s child. Both of your perspectives are valid, so either you compromise, or you split up due to incompatibility. \n\nIt\u2019s good that you were upfront with him, and he was ok with it at the time. But it\u2019s also ok for him to change his feelings. Like I wouldn\u2019t care if someone I knew was a surrogate. But if my own sibling decided to go for it, I would have different feelings about it. People\u2019s feelings about certain topics change when they get close to people whom it affects. \n\nFundamentally you guys are gonna have to talk about it. And decide how to move forward.", "NAH. These are big decisions that affect both of you. It\u2019s ok that you see it totally differently, but it may mean you\u2019re incompatible as a couple if he can\u2019t support you.", "I have a feeling that he thinks that he can be attached to the idea of you  being pregnant with his baby , that he has to live with you pregnant but it\u2019s not his , so it is weird to him. He probably thinks it\u2019s not natural . Idk , I don\u2019t think he like you being a surrogate to begin with but since you two are in an actual relationship he think he can be honest with you. It\u2019s just one pregnancy and you are under contract right? \nYou are doing a wonderful thing for the family. You\u2019ve only been with him five months .. I think if you both are not on board with your decision I think you need to break up.", "He told you what he wanted to hear because you\u2019re beautiful, and he want you. He lied to you about his feelings regarding your potential surrogacy. Would you have continued the relationship if he\u2019d told you how he really felt?  No, of course not. That would have been your last date with him.\n\nNTA. In fact, you should stop seeing the lying liar.", "So he thinks that, having dated you for five months, he owns your body and can tell you what you can and can't do with it?\n\nThat what he wants is more important than what you want, even for your own body, and fir your sense of honour (sticking to a promise you made)? If it was and will be your eggs that were used,  you have to add in that you are the only person in the world who can provide a full sibling.\n\n\n>\"No, you don't need the money. Babe, no. You're with me, you aren't a baby factory. We have future plans.\" \n\nIt's not for him to say whether you need the money and, I suspect, it is about more than just the money for you and the couple.\n\n\"You're with me\" sounds like either:\n'You are with me, you can't do that' (yes you can) or\n'You are with me I will provide for you financially (but only if you do as I say)'.\n\nNope, that's no how it works. Especially after 5 months (or 100 business days!)\n\nNTA but you should seriously rethink this relationship.", "NTA he thinks 5 months is serious?", "NAH - I wouldn't want to have to go through a S Os pregnancy for 0 pay off, si I get where he's coming from.  But it's your body, do what you want.  He wouldn't be an asshole if he leaves though.", "Nta but neither is he.
