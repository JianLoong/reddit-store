Who we\u2019ll call Ethan(24M) and Brandon (22M). Brandon for the most part is pretty chill, super respectful of the shared bathroom space, puts the seat down, cleans when it\u2019s his turn (not exactly to my standard but I know i grew up in a house where my mom was super anal about cleaning and he tries, and that\u2019s really all i care about). He never leaves an egregious mess, and always cleans the drain. \n\nEthan however never cleans the bathroom, always leave various types of hair everywhere, often forgets to flush, leaves trash on the floor, and has the worst aim imaginable. It\u2019s like he tries to piss facing away from the toilet with a blindfold on. Ever time Brandon and I scrub the bathroom, the next day (sometimes even sooner) there\u2019s piss on the rim, seat, on the outside of the bowl, floor and WALL. All over basically. It\u2019s like someone exploded a piss monster inside the bathroom. and he NEVER wipes it up. I\u2019ll ask him, and he\u2019ll be like \u201cFor sure, I\u2019ll do that, my bad.\u201d and then doesn\u2019t.

The men you've consulted are balking at your AWESOME idea because it \"Might be a bit rude\". \n\nHey. You know what's rude? Pissing all over like an untrained animal and expecting OTHER people to clean up after you - or just tolerate wallowing in urine and occassional scat. But No One (in your house) wants to talk about that. \n\nSure the expectations are being rehashed in meetings. But who has said to Ethan. \"Dude you are a rude and filthy motherfucker and I'm not having it!\" Who has challenged him on his ultimate lack of decency and respect? The time for niciety is way past. This calls for more severe measures and Ethan deserves every bit of it. \n\nYES buy those piss targets and use them. Keep using them until the problem is corrected for a good week and the revert to it if/when Ethan forgets to aim. If he's embarrassed, well dude you SHOULD be embarrassed. That's the fuckin' point. You are embarrassing yourself for behaving like a toddler that never had home training and so now it's on OP, the House Mommy, to show you the way. Fuck Ethan's feelings. He's unspeakably rude and if he can't learn to live like a human he doesn't deserve to live with them. Hit the bowl or GTFO. And that's without even going into his failure to clean up after himself. \n\nOP NTA. Get the targets. Plus a roll of paper towels and clorox bathroom spray to park on top of the tank. If he misses the target, march him in and point at all the spots and supervise his cleaning of his mistake. He'll learn. That's how all us mom's taught our boys. I'm sorry Ethan was raised by alley cats and now it's on you to show him how to be a big boy. \n\nGood luck OP.", "NTA\n\nGrown 24-year old dude can't properly piss in a bowl? Yeah, get some stickers.", "NTA but that's not going to help. Maybe try hitting him in the wallet? If he can't aim or clean up, let him pay for a cleaner twice a week specifically for the bathroom.", "A sticker is rude but pissing all over the bathroom is not? You have weird, gross friends. NTA.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA\u2026\n\nI think it would be hilarious!!??", "TinylilSub has the best idea yet: **OP needs to tell this guy, \u201cI will use YOUR pillow, clothes, or towels to clean the toilet if he can\u2019t use it properly.\u201d Then do it.** NTA.", "I read the headline and thought you were a jerk, but no, NTA.  However, sadly, he's not going to change his behavior.  He may even spray harder. :(\n\nI hope you can get rid of him soon.", "My husband silts down to piss by preference.  He did it when I met him, so it wasn\u2019t my idea.  Men can ABSOLUTELY do that.  Weaponized incompetence like this deserves to be publicly shamed.  NTA", "NTA. You've tried. Embarrassment might work. I had a roommate who never took out the trash. We all decided to not take it and see what his breaking point was where he'd actually take the initiative and do it himelf. After two weeks of stacking trash as carefully as we could and him still not taking it out, we literally took the trash can and put it in the middle of his room while he was in class. He got home, took it out, left without saying a word, stayed overnight somewhere, and came back the next day. He got over it in a day and took the trash out frequently from then on out.", "I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a cultural difference here, but to me it\u2019s not just NTA, it\u2019s quite funny. I\u2019m Danish and here it\u2019s quite common to take the piss (pun intended) on your friends. I mean, you\u2019re right to be annoyed about it and instead of having a big argument, you\u2019re telling him to get the grip in a funny, teasing way. It\u2019s a prank but serious at the same time. So to me, just go for it, have a laugh about it, and he\u2019ll try to do better. But again, depending on your culture and the sense of humour in that culture, it could be different.", "NTA\n\nMaybe find him a giant funnel.\n\nMaybe he was told not to touch it.\nI'm a guy, I have know idea why some men think it is ok to make a mess.\n\nGo ahead a be rude,", "NTA. \nI'd use the stickers.. lol act like a child, I will treat you like one. \n\nIf the other roommates have an issue with the stickers then he can use their bathroom.

We all got along and to this day I consider them \"brothers from another mother\".", "NTA, it would be a reminder, but it's not going to work.

You either kick him out, become his mother and march him into the bathroom and stand over him while he cleans it until he get the idea or moves out, or live with it.", "NTA. But the sticker isn't going to solve anything either. Tell him you will tell his future SO if he keeps it up.", "NTA. Btw, it is never rude to respond to rudeness. What your roommate is doing is incredibly rude.", "NTA. If you're cleaning up his piss, I don't see how this is rude.", "NTA. This guy's a slob. It doesn't matter what you do.\n\nAlso, aim doesn't really help that much. I live alone and sit down for everything now. Just a better way to keep everything contained and when people visit, they aren't grossed out.", "NTA but the real issue here is that you guys keep cleaning up after the gross one. Make him clean, or charge him for housekeeping. Add it to his rent, or detract it from yours. Have a sit down with him where in the two of you explain that this is happening, and either he pays, plays, or moves out.", "NTA you\u2019ve already tried talking to him and you\u2019ve been putting up with this for months", "NTA. He should be cleaning up the mess he's leaving in the bathroom, hands down. For that alone, he's TA here. But there might be a reason why he has poor bathroom hygiene that might embarrass him? Like a medical issue of some kind? So maybe the stickers might be a tad mean if that's the case, but if he's just a straight-up AH, that's hilarious. You should be able to take a situation (that you're literally cleaning up the mess of) and make a harmless joke to help show him how much of an AH he really is.", "Throw some Cheerios in the toilet.", "NTA. Take pictures of his mess and post it on social media, tagging him. Let embarrassment do the work for you. He's literally decided that you can pick up his shit and clean up his pee. That's beyond disgusting.", "NTA but I\u2019d go nuclear\u2026 piss has nothing on used feminine hygiene products and period blood left in the same locations he leaves his piss. Just sayin.", "YTA\u2026 sort of. Before people kill me here\u2019s my reasoning. It\u2019s not going to work and you know it. All that\u2019ll happen is start a war. Your heart is in the right place and it\u2019s certainly a huge problem that you should not be dealing with. But stickers won\u2019t solve the problem, just create a new one on top of the one that you already have. \n\nHe can clean up his own mess. THAT\u2019s the solution, not a shot fired across the bow.", "The only thing you're going to do is cause problems.\n\nThe fact of the matter is unless he's sitting down, there's always splashback. If it isn't from the urine it's from the water in the toilet.\n\nI acknowledge it's a problem and at the very least they need to clean up after themselves, but if you're trying to *solve* a problem, this isn't it.\n\nESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Nobody wants to look at that.", "NTA - Next time he does it, bring him to the bathroom, then push his face in it and say \"bad boy!\"\n\nmaybe that'd work?", "NTA but buy a realistic looking bug sticker instead.", "NTA he aims better or he gets bathroom clean up 100%", "I\u2019d just move out. He knows it\u2019s a problem, he hasn\u2019t changed, he\u2019s not gonna change. Make him live in his own filth.", "OH MY EFFING GOD! MY STEPFATHER DID THIS AND I WAS THE ONE WHO GOT STUCK CLEANING THE BATHROOM! Um\u2026 and I\u2019m apparently still mad about it. NTA OP. Get the stickers. Get an arrow for the toilet tank and a splash guard for the floor. Then maybe he\u2019ll mind where he\u2019s pointing his man hose.", "Men can't sit down to piss or use the toilet without making a mess?  That's bullshit.  My husband grew up in a country where urinals aren't a thing.  He sits down to pee and taught our sons to do the same.  The seat is always down because of that and there's never a drop of urine on the seat.\n\nOnce our sons were fully potty trained we made them clean up whatever toilet mess they made immediately and left supplies in the bathroom for that purpose.  They're now 11 and 15 and never leave a mess on or around the toilet.", "Just FYI Ive bought some of the targets for my son when he was potty training. I did find any that stayed on the spot for more than a few flushes. Really disappointing. But great idea!", "Absolutely NTA. In fact I adore this idea! I'm 24, I met my bf at 22 and he's the first and only person I've ever been with. I've heard of guys doing what you're talking about and getting pee all over the place. Luckily, *somehow,* I was lucky enough to get a guy who doesn't do this, and he even puts the toilet seat down without needing to be asked to. I grew up in a house with my mom and my dad, and two older brothers so I know how uncommon it is to meet a guy who puts the seat down. More common to meet a guy who can actually aim for and hit the toilet when peeing, but still. If my bf had been the type to do what you're explaining I'd have probably done something similar. I would love an update on how things go if you go through with this idea!", "Have the guys talk to him. And, raise his share of the rent.", "Absolutely ANYTHING you do in response to this animal pissing on the walls is FINE, up to and including standing outside the bathroom door with a dead fish and slapping him across the face with it when he emerges.\n\nSeriously, his behavior is so disgusting that you can stop worrying about being rude. He needs a hard wake up immediately. There is no excuse for a grown man to spray urine all over the place.\n\nNTA", "NTA. That guy needs to learn to aim properly. Its like he doesnt care and because others clean up for him, hes doing literally nothing about it", "NTA, I share a bathroom with a male who literally refuses to flush his shit or clean the bathroom.\n\nNTA, you\u2019re trying to make light of a situation that\u2019s frustrating. If he gets upset then he knows it\u2019s an issue.", "NTA and just match his gross with your gross leave your used tampons and pads laying around out in the open leave blood stains on the seat on the floor on the wall and when he/they flip out be like oh I thought that was normal in this house you leave you can't be bothered to clean up your pee or aim so I didn't think I had to either \ud83d\ude09", "Disagree. This guy clearly doesn\u2019t care about OP\u2019s feelings; a rant and stickers won\u2019t change his behavior, at least not in the right direction. **IMO, he needs consequences that put the disgusting mess on HIM, where it belongs.** \n\nI commented elsewhere, piggybacking off what another Redditor told her guy roommates: OP should tell her roommate that from now on, she\u2019ll be cleaning the toilet & bathroom with his pillow, clothes, and towels. And then do it, throwing the used stuff on his bed afterwards for him to wallow in.", "I agree with you! Additionally, the guys should get together and tell Ethan to clean up his mess or wear a diaper (how about getting him some along with the stickers \ud83e\udd14?). Or, tell him his share of the rent goes up because you didn't sign up to clean his piss.", "this comment was probably the best thing ive read today. thank you.", "Especially feces on the floor, there is no universe where that happened by accident...", "Totally agree. As long as someone else is bearing the consequences (cleaning it up) this guy won\u2019t care what they do. He gets to be a slob, and someone else takes care of it\u2026 he\u2019s good.", "That would be unpleasant to step on coming out of the shower.. talk about shooting yourself in the foot", "NGL I\u2019d have wiped it up with some TP,  wrapped it up in a nice box with a little bow, then left it on his pillow with a note inside that says: Never leave this kind of \u201cpresent\u201d in the bathroom again. \n\nAs for the rest, I\u2019d keep cleaning it but put the used paper towels in his room. On his desk, in his sock drawer, in his shoes, in his gloves, in his gym bag, and if it persists: his car and his food. If he wants to be a nuisance that pisses like an unmanned fire hose that\u2019s perfectly fine; but he absolutely will NOT escape the reality of how much work he\u2019s creating for his roommates. \n\nIf all else fails buy him a litter box for his room like the animal he is.", "\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd23", "It was awful and no longer white, and did I mention crunchy. Even worse, a very humid climate with no ventilation, so it was just so disgusting.", "It was horrific and no longer white, and don't forget crunchy.", "At that rate I'd just offer to tear up the entire carpet\n\n...while wearing a hazmat. Never know! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23"]}
