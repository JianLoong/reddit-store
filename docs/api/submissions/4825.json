Who we\u2019ll call Ethan(24M) and Brandon (22M). Brandon for the most part is pretty chill, super respectful of the shared bathroom space, puts the seat down, cleans when it\u2019s his turn (not exactly to my standard but I know i grew up in a house where my mom was super anal about cleaning and he tries, and that\u2019s really all i care about). He never leaves an egregious mess, and always cleans the drain. \n\nEthan however never cleans the bathroom, always leave various types of hair everywhere, often forgets to flush, leaves trash on the floor, and has the worst aim imaginable. It\u2019s like he tries to piss facing away from the toilet with a blindfold on. Ever time Brandon and I scrub the bathroom, the next day (sometimes even sooner) there\u2019s piss on the rim, seat, on the outside of the bowl, floor and WALL. All over basically. It\u2019s like someone exploded a piss monster inside the bathroom. and he NEVER wipes it up.

The men you've consulted are balking at your AWESOME idea because it \"Might be a bit rude\". \n\nHey. You know what's rude? Pissing all over like an untrained animal and expecting OTHER people to clean up after you - or just tolerate wallowing in urine and occassional scat. But No One (in your house) wants to talk about that. \n\nSure the expectations are being rehashed in meetings. But who has said to Ethan. \"Dude you are a rude and filthy motherfucker and I'm not having it!\" Who has challenged him on his ultimate lack of decency and respect? The time for niciety is way past. This calls for more severe measures and Ethan deserves every bit of it. \n\nYES buy those piss targets and use them. Keep using them until the problem is corrected for a good week and the revert to it if/when Ethan forgets to aim. If he's embarrassed, well dude you SHOULD be embarrassed. That's the fuckin' point. You are embarrassing yourself for behaving like a toddler that never had home training and so now it's on OP, the House Mommy, to show you the way. Fuck Ethan's feelings. He's unspeakably rude and if he can't learn to live like a human he doesn't deserve to live with them. Hit the bowl or GTFO. And that's without even going into his failure to clean up after himself. \n\nOP NTA. Get the targets. Plus a roll of paper towels and clorox bathroom spray to park on top of the tank. If he misses the target, march him in and point at all the spots and supervise his cleaning of his mistake. He'll learn. That's how all us mom's taught our boys. I'm sorry Ethan was raised by alley cats and now it's on you to show him how to be a big boy. \n\nGood luck OP.", "NTA\n\nGrown 24-year old dude can't properly piss in a bowl? Yeah, get some stickers.", "NTA but that's not going to help. Maybe try hitting him in the wallet? If he can't aim or clean up, let him pay for a cleaner twice a week specifically for the bathroom.", "A sticker is rude but pissing all over the bathroom is not? You have weird, gross friends. NTA.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA\u2026\n\nI think it would be hilarious!!??", "TinylilSub has the best idea yet: **OP needs to tell this guy, \u201cI will use YOUR pillow, clothes, or towels to clean the toilet if he can\u2019t use it properly.\u201d Then do it.** NTA.", "I read the headline and thought you were a jerk, but no, NTA.  However, sadly, he's not going to change his behavior.  He may even spray harder. :(\n\nI hope you can get rid of him soon.", "My husband silts down to piss by preference.  He did it when I met him, so it wasn\u2019t my idea.  Men can ABSOLUTELY do that.  Weaponized incompetence like this deserves to be publicly shamed.  NTA", "NTA. You've tried. Embarrassment might work. I had a roommate who never took out the trash. We all decided to not take it and see what his breaking point was where he'd actually take the initiative and do it himelf. After two weeks of stacking trash as carefully as we could and him still not taking it out, we literally took the trash can and put it in the middle of his room while he was in class. He got home, took it out, left without saying a word, stayed overnight somewhere, and came back the next day. He got over it in a day and took the trash out frequently from then on out.", "I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a cultural difference here, but to me it\u2019s not just NTA, it\u2019s quite funny. I\u2019m Danish and here it\u2019s quite common to take the piss (pun intended) on your friends. I mean, you\u2019re right to be annoyed about it and instead of having a big argument, you\u2019re telling him to get the grip in a funny, teasing way. It\u2019s a prank but serious at the same time. So to me, just go for it, have a laugh about it, and he\u2019ll try to do better. But again, depending on your culture and the sense of humour in that culture, it could be different.", "NTA\n\nMaybe find him a giant funnel.\n\nMaybe he was told not to touch it.\nI'm a guy, I have know idea why some men think it is ok to make a mess.\n\nGo ahead a be rude,", "NTA. \nI'd use the stickers.. lol act like a child, I will treat you like one. \n\nIf the other roommates have an issue with the stickers then he can use their bathroom.

We all got along and to this day I consider them \"brothers from another mother\".", "NTA, it would be a reminder, but it's not going to work.

You either kick him out, become his mother and march him into the bathroom and stand over him while he cleans it until he get the idea or moves out, or live with it.", "NTA. But the sticker isn't going to solve anything either. Tell him you will tell his future SO if he keeps it up.", "NTA. Btw, it is never rude to respond to rudeness. What your roommate is doing is incredibly rude.", "NTA. If you're cleaning up his piss, I don't see how this is rude.", "NTA. This guy's a slob. It doesn't matter what you do.\n\nAlso, aim doesn't really help that much. I live alone and sit down for everything now. Just a better way to keep everything contained and when people visit, they aren't grossed out.", "NTA but the real issue here is that you guys keep cleaning up after the gross one. Make him clean, or charge him for housekeeping. Add it to his rent, or detract it from yours. Have a sit down with him where in the two of you explain that this is happening, and either he pays, plays, or moves out.", "NTA you\u2019ve already tried talking to him and you\u2019ve been putting up with this for months", "NTA. He should be cleaning up the mess he's leaving in the bathroom, hands down. For that alone, he's TA here. But there might be a reason why he has poor bathroom hygiene that might embarrass him? Like a medical issue of some kind? So maybe the stickers might be a tad mean if that's the case, but if he's just a straight-up AH, that's hilarious. You should be able to take a situation (that you're literally cleaning up the mess of) and make a harmless joke to help show him how much of an AH he really is.", "Throw some Cheerios in the toilet.", "NTA. Take pictures of his mess and post it on social media, tagging him. Let embarrassment do the work for you. He's literally decided that you can pick up his shit and clean up his pee. That's beyond disgusting.", "NTA but I\u2019d go nuclear\u2026 piss has nothing on used feminine hygiene products and period blood left in the same locations he leaves his piss. Just sayin.", "YTA\u2026 sort of. Before people kill me here\u2019s my reasoning. It\u2019s not going to work and you know it. All that\u2019ll happen is start a war. Your heart is in the right place and it\u2019s certainly a huge problem that you should not be dealing with. But stickers won\u2019t solve the problem, just create a new one on top of the one that you already have. \n\nHe can clean up his own mess. THAT\u2019s the solution, not a shot fired across the bow.", "The only thing you're going to do is cause problems.\n\nThe fact of the matter is unless he's sitting down, there's always splashback. If it isn't from the urine it's from the water in the toilet.\n\nI acknowledge it's a problem and at the very least they need to clean up after themselves, but if you're trying to *solve* a problem, this isn't it.\n\nESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

BLOOD EVERYWHERE.\n\nNTA btw op.", "I\u2019d literally tell any partner he brought over as long as it was happening!", "but he is not cleaning up his own messes, so your lack of a solution is to just have the other roomates have to eventually do it to not live in apalling conditions", "But he does not clean it. That's the whole point. Should OP and Brandon refrain from going to the bathroom or accept to walk and sit on his pee and shit because he is too disgusting to clean up?\n\nETA: NTA at all OP", "how the fuck is piss and shit on the floor not problems?", "OMG.  Tell the 'poor' man to grow a pair and pull up his big boy panties.", "Except it should say hours to start.", ">the guys should get together and tell Ethan to clean up his mess or wear a diaper\n\n%1100 this, 42m and I dang well sit down for my first pee in the morning because I know I'm nowhere near awake enough to aim with full accuracy.", "god this stuff infuriates me, we had a male friend stay with us for a while when i was in hs and he pissed and shit EVERYWHERE in our bathroom and it magically stopped when my mom stopped cleaning up after him, he had the audacity to say the bathroom was \u201cdisgusting\u201d too, like yeah dawg so are you get used to it", "facts. my ex refused to sit to pee because he wasn\u2019t a \u201cwoman\u201d but sat there and cried when mommy bitched bc he left pee all over the toilet seat. i think we only were together for two weeks or so after that, good riddance. with my current boyfriend, it\u2019s shocking to see him stand to go.", "Ty!", "Ok. So my nephew is like 6\u20197 and pees all over the floor. The kid is like 30 now. He used to come over every weekend to hang out with my daughter. Every time he came over there was pee. He actually destroyed the hardwood floors in my brothers house because the urine ate away the wood. In my old place the urine sunk into the tile so bathroom always smelled like urine no matter what you used or how often you cleaned. He had roommates who also complained he missed. It\u2019s nasty. \n\nSo then I moved. When he came over I put newspaper down on the floor around the toilet. He was highly offended. I told him that if he couldn\u2019t pee in the toilet then I was going to treat him like a dog who isn\u2019t housebroken. Every time he came over the newspaper went down. He did stop coming over eventually but it\u2019s better then him destroying my floors. My new house has wood floors in the bathrooms. I guess he probably doesn\u2019t like me much because I did that but we just saw each other on TG and it was all good.", "Natural if you don\u2019t clean your own bathroom", "  It\u2019s baffling when so many men clearly have an issue doing so hygienically and can become deeply offended when sitting is suggested.", "my thoughts, if you can\u2019t aim when you stand, don\u2019t stand. what is the power move when you stand and cover literally every surface with your urine", "To each his own. My wife has never complained because, as I said, I clean up after myself well if it ever happens. If it was an issue then I would sit down, but I also don't really think its acceptable to dictate what other people do in the bathroom as long as they don't leave a mess.", "WTF? I mean it. Really, WTF!  So he's a lot taller than average. Does he think the bathrooms in the NBA locker rooms are simply awash in piss? That these men in their unbelievably expensive homes just...splash piss everywhere? Jesus. I would be so damn embarrassed if I literally ruined floors trying to piss.", "If you are going to behave like a dog that needs to be housebroken, then you get what you deserve.  Look at him square in the eye (like I do my dog) and let  him know who's in charge at your house.", "I would have been handing him a catheter and a catheter bag... ffs what an AH. If you *can't* use a toilet, then you don't *get* to use the toilet.", "Frankly, if he\u2019s that tall he could kneel on the floor and get it in there no problem.   Posing everywhere is a choice. A lazy-ass choice.", "Well, except I live alone, and I keep my bathroom spotless.  If it's one of those rare times I miss the bowl at all, I clean up.\n\nTo be honest -I enjoy cleaning my bathroom, it's my favourite room to clean.  Nice smooth surfaces.", "No -it's baffling so many men are slobs, or too lazy to clean up.\n\nAgain - standing is a natural way to do it.\n\nI stand, because it's quicker and less effort.   It's pretty rare for me to miss, but, on the other hand, I clean up after myself.", "Gender-based ego? Lol. I think that's a bit of a stretch. Men stand up to pee purely for convenience. It's definitely not like most of us are purposely peeing everywhere like a dog marking its territory. Dude in this story might be, but even that is just a conjecture.", "Right, but if you can't aim and refuse to clean then you shouldn't whine about being told to sit, I'm a guy, I work in a factory warehouse with 200+ employees, if we could determine who was f'ing up the bathrooms without planting cameras in there they would be fired and blacklisted. It's disgusting.", "From the op -\n\n> Male friends i mentioned this to told me that [...] I can\u2019t expect a man to sit down to piss. (which i never said\n\nIronically, I know a lot of guys who sit to pee. B/c they're tall and don't want to have to deal with the backsplash mess.\n\n> not like most of us\n\nI'mma stop you right there, since I obviously said nothing about \"most\" guys. That's a fun straw-man, tho.^/s", "Ever worked as a cleaner?  Because the women's bathroom is usually even nastier.", "I'm 6'6\" and also sit down sometimes. I know guys that do and that don't. All I'm saying is that it is ridiculous to assume that lots of men are going around pissing on everything as some sort of gender dominance thing."]}
