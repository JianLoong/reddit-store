My family from all over the world regularly visit and stay with us. In return, we stay with them when we visit their cities for various reasons (work, vacation, etc). \n\nLast year I had to travel to the city where her brother lives and she decided to come to visit him and his family. She asked if we could stay with them and he declined because he\u2019s still protective of his family due to the world event. I understood at first and we stayed at a hotel but later got annoyed because they had no problem going to dinner and out with us in public. Earlier this year I had to go back to his city and again she came along to visit them. He again declined her request to stay at their house so we stayed at a hotel. I understand some people just don\u2019t like to have overnight guests. The visit went smoothly and everyone had a good time.\n\nLast week he called to ask if he and his family could stay at our place when they come here in a couple of weeks for their vacation. I got really annoyed at this because he didn\u2019t let us stay at his house but wants to stay at ours. I told my fianc\u00e9 they can stay at a hotel but she argued that they would need 3 rooms for 7 days due to their family size. She then pointed out we always let my family stay with us at which point I countered that is because we\u2019re always invited to stay with my family whenever we visit their cities. She argued family do things for each other without expecting anything in return. We went back and forth until bed last night.\n\nI\u2019m sitting here having coffee while she\u2019s sleeping and I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019m wrong. On one hand, I know I can be stubborn and petty. On the other hand, he doesn\u2019t invite us to stay with him while expecting us to house him and his family.\n\nWhat do you think?", "created_utc": 1690026009, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156huox/aita_for_letting_my_family_stay_at_our_house_but/", "score": 615, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason family (and friends) do things for eachother is because family is supposed to be a mutually supportive group, in which everyone contributes in some way, according to their ability. Sure, you aren't keeping score in a \"quid pro quo\" way, but the model works on reciprocity. If they couldn't let you stay because they had no room, and they were hospitable in other ways while you were in their town (having you for dinner, some sightseeing at their expense), I would say you should reciprocate by letting them stay, as each household was \"hosting\" according to their means. If they were coming to your town for, say, a health emergency, I would say that as family you should help them. But if they just don't want to be inconvenienced by you, you aren't obligated to offer them free vacation lodging.", "NTA.

Hold on, he wouldn't let the two of you stay with him\u2026 But he wants seven of them to stay with you?  Her argument of family does stuff for each other without expecting anything in return would hold more water if her family also felt that way. But it's not supposed to be a one-way street.

As painful as this might sound, it can lead to potential relationship issues and / or a dissolution of the relationship.", "NTA", "Info: have you ever been inside brothers house?

He clearly likes spending time with you. I feel like this may be a communication issue?", "NTA. She's arguing that they need 3 rooms in a hotel, but that's a bad argument. You were only two adults and so needed less room and would be less of a burden/noise in their house and they didn't let you stay. Now they want to stay in your house, need more rooms, have kids, more noise, WAY more of a burden and they just expect you to put up with it. In other words, they want a way way bigger favour than you hoped of them and they denied you. \n\nWas it also a week you went to their city to stay or was it only a couple of days as it's a work trip rather than vacation?", "NTA. But it is going to be a question of whether or not you will die on this hill. You aren\u2019t yet married, so visits will only happen more.

Then ask them if you wouldn't find the same or similar if they stayed with you and why they think it would be any different. Don't say no right away.

My family from all over the world regularly visit and stay with us. In return, we stay with them when we visit their cities for various reasons (work, vacation, etc). \n\nLast year I had to travel to the city where her brother lives and she decided to come to visit him and his family. She asked if we could stay with them and he declined because he\u2019s still protective of his family due to the world event. I understood at first and we stayed at a hotel but later got annoyed because they had no problem going to dinner and out with us in public. Earlier this year I had to go back to his city and again she came along to visit them. He again declined her request to stay at their house so we stayed at a hotel. I understand some people just don\u2019t like to have overnight guests. The visit went smoothly and everyone had a good time.\n\nLast week he called to ask if he and his family could stay at our place when they come here in a couple of weeks for their vacation. I got really annoyed at this because he didn\u2019t let us stay at his house but wants to stay at ours. I told my fianc\u00e9 they can stay at a hotel but she argued that they would need 3 rooms for 7 days due to their family size. She then pointed out we always let my family stay with us at which point I countered that is because we\u2019re always invited to stay with my family whenever we visit their cities. She argued family do things for each other without expecting anything in return. We went back and forth until bed last night.\n\nI\u2019m sitting here having coffee while she\u2019s sleeping and I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019m wrong. On one hand, I know I can be stubborn and petty. On the other hand, he doesn\u2019t invite us to stay with him while expecting us to house him and his family.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Maybe ask what the difference is so you can know for future reference and planning. \n\nYou are NTA for asking the question or saying no.  Brother is the T A for creating the situation.", "House guests are two yeses or one no. And I would say no in this case especially because they have refused hospitality not once, but twice, so give them a taste of their own medicine.", "I'd just say am not comfortable after recent world events", "Is the world event they mention the pandemic?", "Not just rooms but how many bathrooms? Three motel rooms generally means 3 bathrooms.  Interesting depending on how many guest rooms and bathrooms you have available.  I might suggest a local air b and b but I\u2019m petty enough you can\u2019t have 2 adults for short visit not sure I\u2019m going to inconvenience myself for a large family for a week.  How will buy food? Are you expected to take time off work and be tour director? Are you expected to give adults a date night and babysit?  Though if family has lots of children their house may not have extra space or be very run down and family is embarrassed.  I wouldn\u2019t let them stay so NTA.", "The disparity in the ask is what caught my attention. Also, from the way the story is presented the request to stay with the brother didn\u2019t come about until the wife wanted to join the trip to visit the brother (twice). Not sure why the wife doesn\u2019t recognize the hypocrisy. There may be some additional family dynamics at play here. NTA", "That's what I was thinking. They can't accommodate 2 adults but expect them to find room for 6, including kids, for a WEEK?! NUTS.", "I was wondering how huge their family would be to need three hotel rooms. \n\nGrowing up, we were a family of 6, and we got one hotel room. Lol. When we were a bit older, occasionally two, but that certainly wasn\u2019t even necessary. But on the other hand, if OP is planning on coming with a bunch of teenagers, that\u2019s still a whole different dynamic too lol", "Exactly. My sibling has had a lot of help and complains that family never help now. I can't think of anything they've done for any family member since they were in their late teens. You don't keep score but no one wants a one sided relationship where they give (time, money, effort) and get nothing in return even if they're family.", "This was my thought. If they need 3 rooms at a hotel, that's a lot of people in my house for a week. That's a BIG ask especially when you're unwilling or even unable to reciprocate. \n\nThe BIL sounds like a jerk tho, who turns down family....twice....then asks for the same favor with a bigger family? \n\nI wouldn't even have space for all those people. \n\nNTA", "This is the simpler more holistic answer in two parts.", "Not just that\u2026 but they are two people, they are bringing maybe 6 if not more. That\u2019s a hell of an ask when they wouldn\u2019t let two people crash.", "Seriously. I get what you are saying. It\u2019s nice in theory to think you could just be generous all the time regardless of what comes back, but we are humans and if a relationship is entirely one sided, resentment grows and it\u2019s a lot more toxic than just saying, \u201cno,\u201d and keeping things more equal.", "This", "Also what's the purpose of their visit? Is it just to visit OP and girlfriend? I think that should be treated differently than a business trip where the visit with family is secondary to why they're there.\n\nOP said they went to visit the brother's city for a business trip. The brother may think it's easier for everyone if the business just pay for the business trip accommodations and his family doesn't have to scrunch to let guests stay in one of their rooms since it sounds like there are a lot of them. \n\nWe need more info about the brother's situation.", "Then why would OP have the place to host such a large family then? Works both way.", "But if that is the case just say so don\u2019t blame it on world events.", "At that point one should say something like, we don\u2019t have any extra bedrooms but you\u2019re welcome to the couch/to set up an air mattress if you want.", "I wouldn't \"love to have you.\" I might \"be willing to accommodate your family with these 'limitations/requirements.\" \nHosting a large family with young children is work.", "It's just with covid and everything.", "Lol...perfect.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019d want to know, too. It obviously isn\u2019t about concern of COVID if he\u2019s willing to stay in their house. OP should tell his fianc\u00e9e he\u2019ll consider it if they can have a conversation about why they\u2019ve been unwelcome at her brother\u2019s house when it appears that COVID isn\u2019t the concern. It\u2019s perfectly fine to be hurt over this and to want to known what\u2019s been going on. I\u2019d have trouble with the relationship (with the in-laws, not the fianc\u00e9e) if I had this situation with my in-laws, and you don\u2019t want to start your married life with something like this between you and your new family.", "I honestly think he should die in this hill. Right now this is a fiance problem. If he caves now, it will only get worse. We've seen enough of these post on here to know this. We see it all the time", "She has a backbone. She *wants* her brother to stay and she's standing up for what she wants to happen in her house where she hosts his family all the time. \n\nWe have no idea what the brother's situation is. He could have a 3 bedroom small home with 7 people. It may be very difficult for him to host even 2 people without significantly disrupting their lives while OP can just pay for a hotel for his business trip through his business.", "Expect this to get worse from her family over time.", "My thoughts exactly. I would be a little bitter about it, but it is fianc\u00e9s house, too. If she\u2019s fine with it I would just let it go and know that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be with her family. Now, if they end up being horrible houseguests that\u2019s another story.", "NTA, ask your fianc\u00e9e to grow a spine.", "I agree with this - especially since there's a lot of info we don't have.  What if there's no space for them to stay with the family in question, or something else preventing it?  What if there are cultural differences between the husband and wife?  On that same note, what if there are different expectations in her family?  I have my suspicions that this situation isn't as cut and dry as the OP makes it out to be.", "This is a good point", "I feel like he should have said that and not blamed it on the pandemic", "This is what I thought.", "OMG.  An adult response?!?!?!?!", "This would totally be me.", "I think I'd be coughing and sniffling all over the place the whole time.", "I think there is an issue with brothers house he's embarrassed to share. Clearly he likes spending time with them.", "Families don't hang each other out to dry on work vacations", "Occupancy limits in the hotel rooms possibly?? I don\u2019t know for sure but this falls under not OPs problem TBH.", "Yeah family does stuff for family but theres times you have to help out in return, its all about give and take.", "Well if the kids are rowdy, they don't need to stay with OP.", "Or maybe his house is gross or something and he's self conscious about it. Not saying that entitles him to a free ride at OP's place but helps explain his motives a bit. Growing up I hated having friends over because we were poor and I was self conscious about how our house didn't stack up my friends. Also being immigrants we had foods and stuff I didn't wanna explain to people. Plus my crazy grandma lived with us and would always be poking around creeping out my friends.
