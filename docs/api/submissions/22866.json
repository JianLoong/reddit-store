My family from all over the world regularly visit and stay with us. In return, we stay with them when we visit their cities for various reasons (work, vacation, etc). \n\nLast year I had to travel to the city where her brother lives and she decided to come to visit him and his family. She asked if we could stay with them and he declined because he\u2019s still protective of his family due to the world event. I understood at first and we stayed at a hotel but later got annoyed because they had no problem going to dinner and out with us in public. Earlier this year I had to go back to his city and again she came along to visit them. He again declined her request to stay at their house so we stayed at a hotel. I understand some people just don\u2019t like to have overnight guests. The visit went smoothly and everyone had a good time.\n\nLast week he called to ask if he and his family could stay at our place when they come here in a couple of weeks for their vacation. I got really annoyed at this because he didn\u2019t let us stay at his house but wants to stay at ours. I told my fianc\u00e9 they can stay at a hotel but she argued that they would need 3 rooms for 7 days due to their family size. She then pointed out we always let my family stay with us at which point I countered that is because we\u2019re always invited to stay with my family whenever we visit their cities. She argued family do things for each other without expecting anything in return. We went back and forth until bed last night.\n\nI\u2019m sitting here having coffee while she\u2019s sleeping and I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019m wrong. On one hand, I know I can be stubborn and petty. On the other hand, he doesn\u2019t invite us to stay with him while expecting us to house him and his family.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nUpdate to answer questions:\n\n1. We have a 4 bedroom house along with many air mattresses. Once we hosted 10 of her college friends when they had a get together. People slept in the living room and dining room. They also have a 4 BR house and we would have been happy to sleep in the living room. We\u2019ve slept on an air mattress many times at my family homes.\n\n2. All of his kids are over 10 and his wife is bringing her sister along and she needs a BR of her own. No one in his family have any disability or condition.\n\n3. Our house is near many of the attractions they want to go to. Due to the popularity of the attractions they want to go to, hotels and house rentals close to those attractions are more expensive than normal. Also, our house is close to shopping and restaurants.\n\n4. My fianc\u00e9 just told me whether they stay with us or not, she\u2019s letting her brother borrow her car for the week so that they\u2019ll only have to rent 1 car. That means we\u2019ll have to carpool that week. This is even more annoying as that would add about an hour to my daily commute.\n\n5. My fianc\u00e9 is a better person than I am. I can be very petty when I\u2019m annoyed which is why I usually take cues from her and go with her decisions in certain situations. In this case, I\u2019m very annoyed which is why we\u2019re in an argument.\n\n6. When it was just me traveling to her brother\u2019s city, my company was paying for a hotel room. When my fianc\u00e9 decided to tag along to visit her brother, she asked him to stay so she could spend more time with her nieces and nephews.", "created_utc": 1690026009, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156huox/aita_for_letting_my_family_stay_at_our_house_but/", "score": 7408, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason family (and friends) do things for eachother is because family is supposed to be a mutually supportive group, in which everyone contributes in some way, according to their ability. Sure, you aren't keeping score in a \"quid pro quo\" way, but the model works on reciprocity. If they couldn't let you stay because they had no room, and they were hospitable in other ways while you were in their town (having you for dinner, some sightseeing at their expense), I would say you should reciprocate by letting them stay, as each household was \"hosting\" according to their means. If they were coming to your town for, say, a health emergency, I would say that as family you should help them. But if they just don't want to be inconvenienced by you, you aren't obligated to offer them free vacation lodging.", "NTA.

Hold on, he wouldn't let the two of you stay with him\u2026 But he wants seven of them to stay with you?  Her argument of family does stuff for each other without expecting anything in return would hold more water if her family also felt that way. But it's not supposed to be a one-way street.

Tit for tat really.", "Nope what goes around comes around.", "NTA. They won't let you stay with them but they want to stay with you and they have so many people that they would need 3 hotel rooms?

As painful as this might sound, it can lead to potential relationship issues and / or a dissolution of the relationship.", "NTA", "Info: have you ever been inside brothers house? Could there be an issue there like he is embarrassed compared to your place? A hoarding issue? Repairs that needed to be done that he hadn't been able to afford so hes embarrassed?

He clearly likes spending time with you. I feel like this may be a communication issue?", "NTA. She's arguing that they need 3 rooms in a hotel, but that's a bad argument. You were only two adults and so needed less room and would be less of a burden/noise in their house and they didn't let you stay. Now they want to stay in your house, need more rooms, have kids, more noise, WAY more of a burden and they just expect you to put up with it. In other words, they want a way way bigger favour than you hoped of them and they denied you. \n\nWas it also a week you went to their city to stay or was it only a couple of days as it's a work trip rather than vacation?", "NTA. But it is going to be a question of whether or not you will die on this hill. You aren\u2019t yet married, so visits will only happen more.

Then ask them if you wouldn't find the same or similar if they stayed with you and why they think it would be any different. Don't say no right away. Just establish the real reasons they said no, and figure out if they really apply anymore in the future.

My family from all over the world regularly visit and stay with us. In return, we stay with them when we visit their cities for various reasons (work, vacation, etc). \n\nLast year I had to travel to the city where her brother lives and she decided to come to visit him and his family. She asked if we could stay with them and he declined because he\u2019s still protective of his family due to the world event. I understood at first and we stayed at a hotel but later got annoyed because they had no problem going to dinner and out with us in public. Earlier this year I had to go back to his city and again she came along to visit them. He again declined her request to stay at their house so we stayed at a hotel. I understand some people just don\u2019t like to have overnight guests. The visit went smoothly and everyone had a good time.\n\nLast week he called to ask if he and his family could stay at our place when they come here in a couple of weeks for their vacation. I got really annoyed at this because he didn\u2019t let us stay at his house but wants to stay at ours. I told my fianc\u00e9 they can stay at a hotel but she argued that they would need 3 rooms for 7 days due to their family size. She then pointed out we always let my family stay with us at which point I countered that is because we\u2019re always invited to stay with my family whenever we visit their cities. She argued family do things for each other without expecting anything in return. We went back and forth until bed last night.\n\nI\u2019m sitting here having coffee while she\u2019s sleeping and I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019m wrong. On one hand, I know I can be stubborn and petty. On the other hand, he doesn\u2019t invite us to stay with him while expecting us to house him and his family.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Pride is a real thing and maybe he doesn't want to admit that he can't provide more space for his family.

Family is supposed to do things for each other without expecting anything in return (as long as there's no estrangement, history of exploitation/abuse).

Maybe they don\u2019t have space, maybe they were going through a particularly hard time and dealing with personal things, maybe the house was a wreck at the moment. With kids, it\u2019s always possible there is a routine/transition issue. Having sensory/anxiety/stimulation issues myself and with kids, sometimes it\u2019s just high stress for some reason. If it\u2019s the school year, I know something like this could throw off our kids whole week as opposed to when it\u2019s vacation time in the summer and we\u2019ve practiced what these transitions look like plus it\u2019s not going to snowball into meltdowns in their classrooms. \n\nAlso, as someone who deals with mental health issues, sometimes it\u2019s that.

OP says nothing about how they went about dinner and public events. Dinner on patios and masked when doing things indoors is a pretty different level of risk than sharing your toilet/kitchen with people who, if they begin showing symptoms/testing positive mid trip, are now stuck isolating in your home.\n\nSimilarly, we don't know much about OP's home, except that it is near the ocean and good for having guests, but it is possible that it is better suited for social distancing if it has things like separate bathrooms for guests and nice outdoor living areas. \n\n2. We don't know why BIL was so concerned about guests. If it was something like one of their kids had a medical condition that has since cleared up or was a baby with little immune system and now they are older or the numbers in their areas had been seeing a spike but are now down again, they could reasonably have different levels of risk tolerance then vs now.\n\n3. Space. If the BIL's family needs at least 3 hotel rooms on vacation, when it is normal for kids to share rooms and even beds, then they likely take up even more space at home. If we assume no more than 2 kids per home bedroom, no home bedrooms shared by kids of different sexes, and at least 3 kids per hotel room (minus 1 room for the parents) then that would suggest a 5 bedroom house for reasonable room sharing and unless we are talking about a house with over 8 rooms there is unlikely to be a guest bedroom if each kid wants their own room, so OP and wife staying over would likely mean kicking a kid out of their room for the visit. On the other hand, even if OP's house has 4 beds (which seems likely if his wife thinks that her brother's family would fit) but 3 are guest rooms then no one would need to be displaced for the BIL's family to stay.", "That\u2019s not accurate. Their reasoning over a year ago was based on different conditions. The catch you\u2019re looking for is that OP says they went out to dinner and out in public with the OP at the *same time and under the same conditions* they declined to have the OP stay in their home.

If there was some reason, the brother could have offered it himself; what he did is give a sus reason the first time and no reason the second.  \n\nAnd he isn't taking the refusal for rudeness, he in fact took the refusal very graciously, acknowledging that some people don't want overnight guests and they have every right not to host.

Maybe they gave small children who wake everyone up at night. Maybe they have dogs who bark a lot of a cat who pees on beds? I hate staying at a home with barking/poorly trained dogs.

You can be vague or descriptive, but you should be honest with yourself and others. Instead of using an excuse you simply acknowledge that \"the house is total chaos right now and you wouldn't be comfortable having anyone staying there.\" The problem with making excuses is that most people catch on eventually. Then you become a liar and people resent you for having to play along with the cover story. It just causes ill will.
