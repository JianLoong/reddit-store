I know it won't help your anxiety, but on the other hand, if it was urgent and they were told that there would be no \"talk\" until a topic was specified, and they refuse to provide one, then it can't be that urgent, can it? No need to worry in that case. \n\nAlso, you have reminded me of an old coworker who used to do this. I have just gone and posted a story about her in r/justnocoworker if you want to go and have a read.", "NTA, when I read your headline I thought OP was the asshole however OP\u2018s responses are perfect and hilarious!", "I had a boss who was literally sitting across from me tell me \u201cwe need to talk\u201d and then leave the room. I thought I was supposed to follow him, so got up too. Nope. He was just informing me we would be meeting that day. He had me book a conference room and then took me there to let me go.", "It really really is that easy. I absolutely hate this too, and SO MANY people do this to me. I\u2019m going to try your approach! \ud83d\ude02 NTA", " My mum would message me on Facebook, I heard the ding-ding-ding, by the time I get my phone, I'm greeted with:  \n\"HELP!\"  \n\"Please, I NEED you!\"  \n\"HELP me!\"  \n\"Where are you?!?!?!?!??!?\"  \n\"I'm desperate....please...\"  \nI call her, while wondering if this is what a heart attack feels like, and she's just \"Soooo, here are two pictures of lamps, which one do you think would look better in my kitchen?\" Even her \"we need to talk\" were accompanied by all the drama(\"it's important/urgent\", \"I'm so lost, I don't know how I'm going to make it\", etc.). Her reasoning was that by making it sound like she'd been kidnapped by the mafia, I'd call her sooner than I would for lamps. \n\nIt did backfire spectacularly when her father had the good sense of humour to die on April 1st. The police got in touch with her, she tried to notify the family, and...everyone thought she was just being her usual dramatic self and promptly ignored her. It was almost a day before her sister was also informed by the police and could start telling the rest. Meanwhile, my mum and I had a long talk about the middle-aged woman who cried wolf.", "No shucking way!!! Lmmfao my husband and I just got rear-ended at a stop sign. Husband got out first. I stayed in the car with the dog....I was driving. He comes back, shakes his head, and says simply \"it's bad.\" How bad???? \"It's bad\" then he walks away....and doesn't come back and elaborate!!!! I had to wait for 5 minutes before he came back and I gave him the dog....I know I could have got out and left the dog in the car at any point.... hindsight lmao...needless to say my car is facing 10,000 plus in damages and that's only if it isn't totaled \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 damn dodge ram", "Fair is fair NTA", "NTA\nI have deep anxiety problems and when someone does this to me, it ruins my whole day. You are a genius, i will start doing this too!", "NTA some people are kinesthetic learners", "NTA. If that makes you an AH, then they also are for doing that thing for a long time. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA. My mom does this too. It\u2019s a way of forcing a call and keeping everything on her terms. It\u2019ll annoying, but I\u2019ve stopped worrying about it.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting your mom KNOWS cryptic texts are manipulative and anxiety producing. She needs to cut it out.", "NTA\nThis is a passive aggressive power move that I hate.\nAs a kid I had someone prominent in my life who did this. I remember how emotionally crippling it was to have thos done to me.\nToday this is a non negotiable boundary with me. If you want to talk to me contact me and do so.\nMy response to ANYONE who tries is: you either talk now or we never talk and stick by it.\nAfter following through a few times, people get the hint and do not do this with me.", "Yeah its assholeish...but funny. Love the passive-aggressive stance. Gets them every time!", "YTA but a justified AH. Please keep doing this. People who say shit like \"we need to talk\" are terrorists and you are doing a public service by putting your unhinged family members in their place.", "NTA it is called tit for tat. Great work.", "NTA Your response is brilliant.", "NTA\n\nIf they can't communicate properly and are constantly diminishing your feelings being a little petty like this is totally fair\nThey are the ones at fault OP, not you", "NTA. That\u2019s brilliant! What\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander.", "NTA. Some people need to have empathy imposed upon them through experiencing what they subject others to.", "NTA and I'm going to star doing this omg you're my hero", "NTA - it\u2019s neither immature nor manipulative; it\u2019s a very smart way of showing them a mirror of their very own behavior and it\u2019s effects on you, and hopefully increases their empathy and will cause some behavioral changes in future.", "Also what great advice! I will be trying this strategy next time someone sends me a we need to talk message!", "Reply,  No we definitely dont.", "Boy do I get you!!! I used to work to the same company with my brother, and he was a manager while I was a supervisor. He was calling me \"come into my office in 10 min\" without another word. I hated it. It could be something simple as \"read this mail, do you remember anything else we should add\" but it could be that the CEO was waiting for us ready to eat our spleen because of a delayed project. I wanted to be prepared if that was the case, because he had the idea that we should remember everything without checking notes and emails and calendars.  I H A T E it with all me heart. So I got mad at some point and I was answering \"ok, I am a available, and the agenda of the meeting?\" While he was my brother i acted completely cold and professional so that I wasn't surprised. But OP that was work and an extremely stressful one with a toxic environment. You are correct about hating it and what you are doing is not manipulative. You just turn their stick into a boomerang.  My only advice is don't stress over things your sister or mother have to say. 99.999 in 10.000 it would be something stupid or light", "My health insurance company does this! They call me with a vague message about needing to call them right away because they have something important to tell me! And then when I call back, it\u2019s just a general message about a new service or something. They will keep calling back with the same vague message until I call them and listen to the announcement. They probably have laws they have to follow, but I would much rather get an email or a letter. \n\nDoes this tactic have a name? I feel like it needs one.", "A week or too is WAAAAAAYYYYYY too long for a UTI to go untreated. Recipe for a kidney or bladder infection that'll be way fucking harder to get rid of. You need meds within the next few days, sooner the better. (Source: have had 3 courses of antibiotics for UTIs in the last 3 months)\n\n\nWhat i dont get is why OP even had to see their doctor at all. I'm in Canada and havent seen a doctor in person in so long, ESPECIALLY not for a UTI! All of these I've just been using  telehealth line, they give me a call back and then i have the prescription sent to my pharmacy immediately. Never more than 48hrs until the meds are in my hands. Sorry abt your countries shitty laws OP,  here they just have to do a disclsimer and I agree and we're good to go\n\n\nETA\" the best way to do this is \"Hello, we hot your test results back, whats the soonest time you can come in to recieve them?\" Can press slightly further if truly urgent. \"We have spaces available in the next xxxxx, do any of those wotk for you? We would prefer (or: do need) to see you as soon as possible.\"", "Cried wolf"]}
