Then she'd call me and ask me what I need to talk about and I ask her what she needed to talk about and she'd say a quick summary of what it was and I'd just say \"is that so hard?\" After a few times she says I'm being a jerk and causing her unnecessary anxiety(lol ironic) She says it is manipulative and I'm messing with her head. I've done it to my sister a couple of times but she caught on and doesn't do it anymore but still called me an asshole. My mom seems to not learn and just keeps doing it.

You're meeting them at their level of communication.", "I don't think your actions are that immature, actually.  Assuming you have told them before that you do not appreciate the \"I need to talk\" text message with no context, they aren't respecting your boundaries.  Albeit it's a little passive aggressive but not enough to put you in the AH category.  If you want to do something less passive aggressive, you could respond to the \"We need to talk\" text with something like, \"Not until you tell me what we need to talk about.\"\n\nAnyway... NTA\n\n...and you're not alone.  I hate \"We need to talk.\" too.", "NTA a little passive aggressive but a harmless way to teach them to get to the point.", "NTA you\\`re giving them a taste of their own medicine. I hate people who do this to the point that I will call them straight away and get them to talk right then and there. I might start using your method though, I think it\\`s quite appropriate.", "Heh, I like your way of handling this. NTA", "NTA \n\nI would say ESH, but based on your post and comments, you've already tried just asking them to stop, and your mom can't be bothered to just say what's up.

And if they can't see how it feels and change their ways, then YTA.\n\nI've literally asked a boss to not to do this and...he said \"I'm sorry, good point!\". \n\nIt's not hard to be considerate of other people.", "NTA. I find this so funny because I would do the same thing. \"Treat others the way you want to be treated\". They give you anxiety with their vague responses, you give them anxiety. Simply, tit for tat.", "NTA. People never like having their shit returned.", "NTA, its petty and passive-aggressive but also kind of funny.", "NTA looool i'mma start doing this too hehe thanks for the tip", "Bwahaha! My dude, NTA.\nMy wife taught me how to do this very thing. But then, you don't pull that crap with her family, especially not her mom's side. They, and she, always replied to \"we need to talk \" with \"indeed we do and there will be consequences \". Which results in some hilarious reactions. My wife says it's a perfect way to give people who do that crap mental whiplash immediately. I find it's an effective way to stop people from playing that game. Because if you agree with their little attempt at passive aggressive manipulation and then throw in the consequences thingy,  their brains implode with \"what? What consequences?\" and ot will drive them batty until they can get hold of you,  lol.\nMy wife's family is not only petty but bent and twisted.", "NTA \n\nI was so ready to say you were based on the title but your a genius!
