And then just tell her about your day.", "I think this tactic is brilliant, and I'm stealing it!  NTA.", "Not gonna lie. I really appreciate this post, thanks for the hack. Coming from someone with a lot of ptsd and anxiety from this simple sentence. Ima start using it. NTA", "NTA. Turnabout is fair play and this seems like a very effective way of getting your point across. I do think if you haven\u2019t already talked to them about it that you should try doing so, but having had similar behavior from relatives in the past, I wish I had thought of this. Gonna use this trick if it ever becomes relevant!", "NTA they just don't like getting back what they give. I'd keep doing it to mom, except go radio silence until you are to meet.", "NTA. My ex Director and vice Director used to do this. It could be anything from asking me to organize a congratulations party to explaining how staffing cuts were going to affect the office (I was number three in line in management.) There was never any way to know where on the list from not \"important at all\" to \"completely up-ending someone's life\" this vague summons was going to fall. I hated it. It didn't matter if I said \"tell me what it's about so I can be prepared for the meeting,\" still no answer just \"we need to talk.\" It was maddening and you have to be exposed to people like this on a regular basis to understand exactly how maddening it is. I don't blame you at all, I resorted to this stuff while I was still with that company. And, like your mother, they didn't like having that screw turned on them. Unfortunately for your future anxiety, they never learned. Be prepared for constant disappointment on this front.", "NTA screw them. Good job.", "NTA\n\nI have a similar problem!  Thanks for the idea!  Though half of this is from work so not sure if I can get away with using this", "NTA\n\nI think that\u2019s a great way to manage it. \n\nYou\u2019ve tried being direct. Many times. They intentionally don\u2019t give a shit and continue to intentionally cause you stress. \n\nYou can also limit the conversations. If your mom says she needs to talk and won\u2019t clarify what about, then tell her you\u2019re available for a sit down coffee next month to talk. When she goes \u201cit won\u2019t be that long!\u201d then let her know she can either tell you now, or she can wait a week and have a week\u2019s worth of things to share with you over coffee.", "If you\u2019re an AH for doing this then they admit that they are too. Mom is pissed you learned her trick. Maybe try \u201cno, we don\u2019t, sorry\u201d just to ring the changes. Also I\u2019d try doing same to Boss sending him we need to talk texts before a big presentation then turn your phone off.  Then agree not to text at all. NTA but hilarious table turning - they all had it coming", "I think this is hilarious. NTA. I'm assuming you told her she does that to you all the time.", "NTA.. They dish it out, but don't like getting it back. Eventually, they will learn. I think it is brilliant.", "NTA, this is awesome!\n\nLet me know how it goes with your boss. \ud83d\ude01", "NTA \n\n That sentence gives me more anxiety than anything else! I have told every serious partner, please don't ever tell me we need to talk and then leave me hanging.\n\nI think you have found an amazing way to handle it! And the fact that they don't see the hypocrisy of being upset with you for doing the exact same thing they've been pulling all these years\u2026 well that's kind of BS.Keep it up! Don't cave until they change their ways and admit they've been a holes all these years.", "NTA - You asked them to stop and explained how you would prefer such interactions to go. They didn\u2019t listen so you gave them a taste of their own medicine. If they want to reframe the relationship into one where neither of you does this behavior to each other (like your sister catching on and stopping) then the ball is in their court now. If they hate it so much they are free to stop doing it to you.", "NTA, you are right, we neet to talks texts suck", "I really hate this but wasn't sure if the \"yes we do\" thing will work. And apparently it does. Thanks OP NTA", "NTA\n\nAnd this is hilarious. The pure irony of it. \ud83d\ude02", "That's not manipulating.\n\n\nThat's just returning fire.", "It's true, when people also sent messages like this to me, I get anxious and can't get through my day\n\nIt really isn't hard to give context, they just want the thrill it would give during the actual conversation. \n\nNow, when people message me like this, I don't reply until they added another message.", "Excellent.", "NTA. Good for you.", "NTA\n\nMy mom does the exact same thing. I\u2019m practically crippled by the anxiety it causes. I\u2019m stealing your technique. Effing brilliant my friend.", "NTA and also can I say FUCK WHOEVER DOES THIS TO THE MOON\n\nKeep doing you my dude, if your old lady can\u2019t get how much of a hypocrite she is well then maybe she should have a long talk with herself. \nYou\u2019re not an asshole for simply engaging with these people using the system they have put in place, perhaps you need to identify to them that the system is assholish", "NTA What you did is correct but scale it begin doing the same to her over tiny things like going to the mall, etc. And next time she complains just tell her you were agreeing with her.", "nta, continue doing it. love it!", "NTA you\u2019re an icon and I\u2019m using this thank you", "Moms used to do the same to me, I\u2019d text back the following when you do this it makes me feel anxious, so if it\u2019s important call me now, if it\u2019s the regular mundane bullshit talk to you whenever. NtA", "NTA I will be using this", "LOL NTA. What's good for the goose is good for the gander. They have no reason to be butthurt when you're simply doing what they do to you. That they both refuse to see how ironic this is, is hilarious.", "Oh so it\u2019s only manipulative if you do it but not them. NTA", "NTA\u2026and I find most women are AHs\u2026even the ones I\u2019m related to.", "I'd almost now do a complete 180 and every time she says \"we need to talk\" now respond \"no, we don't\" or \"eh, not feeling it.\" But that's me being petty and dishing out a-holery", "It may be petty but its absolutely hilarious to me... OPs sister is cool she can tell him he is an asshole because she stopped doing it. OPs mom on other hand is either legit stupid (no offense) or she is just inconsiderate. If its the latter its not even petty IMO its just getting rid of anxiety caused by someone who doesnt care by only way that you know.", "Asked my GP about this once after a similar incident. Untreated UTIs are not immediately life threatening but do need treated quickly. So not wrong to have urgency.\n\nAnd if tests for uti or cancer and it is cancer, then most doctors don't want to give a hard to handle diagnosis outside a space where people can ask questions, get support and they can check there is a network to help. So they can't say it is cancer on phone or text. But if they say it is a UTI, then people who don't get told know it is cancer or something as bad. People talk about diagnosis and messages. So best to say nothing until person in room.", "OP, no one in my life does this and I would be pissed if anyone did. That is to say: the way people have been interacting with you is not a required part of being human. You can go a whole lifetime and just not do that! \n\nNTA", "Oh helllllll no!  \n\nI hate being on the phone. If I call and have to leave a voice Mail I leave annoyingly long ones because I will cover everything necessary so that when I get called back I expect a to-the-point convo! \n\n\u201cHey it\u2019s me.

Hope you are having a good day!\u201d \n\nNo ambiguity in my messages.", "My sister LOVED doing this, we are LC right now, we bounce between that and NC. She is mad at me now though for enforcing a boundary, so she isn't calling me and I'm  not calling her. It's exhausting.", "It still doesn\u2019t quite make sense but I think we can blame autocorrect and maybe this whole thing is coming out wrong.", "And the award for the most dumb and useless advice goes to... This guy! Congratulations! /s", "Quit with the thread-jacking.  This is not a news site.\n\nDownvoted.", "I'm lucky - that time was a one-off and she never did it again after I told her how anxious it made me!", "I *think* they\u2019re saying OP is NTA now, but if the fam sees the error of their ways and change and OP continues this behavior then they will be TA.", "I'm glad she respected you enough to listen. Mine just huffs real loud and I can hear her rolling her eyes."]}
