We don't really know our neighbors except for 3-4 people. \n\nGot slapped with a big fine for general electricity coz of a mistake. Each flat pays by meter, but usage of electricity for elevators and what not was not accounted for for many years. Now electricity provider decided to get their money and each flat needs to pay an average of 3-4 months of individual usage on top of their own usage. \n\nWe consulted the company and lawyer and decided to pay, some neighbors decided not to. They were cut off on Monday.\n\nToday while Hb is out I was woken up from a nap by knocking on the door. We have a dog and she guards me when Hb is out, so during the whole convo I had to hold her back. I open the door and see a woman I don't know holding a kid 3-4 years old, the convo goes like this:\n\nMe: How can I help you?\n\nHer: you know, we have no electricity.\n\nMe: Okay, so?\n\nHer: Can I use yours?\n\nMe: Excuse me, what?\n\nHer: My child needs his daily inhalation. It's gonna take about 20-30 minutes.\n\nMe: I'm sorry, my Hb is out and I'm not letting anyone in.\n\nHer: You don't have to let me in, I'm gonna bring an extension cord so just plug it in and I will use it in my place \n\nMe: I'm sorry, my Hb is out and I'm not doing anything like that without consulting him first. Have a nice day.\n\nSo she goes Pikachu face and I close the door. I talked to my friend and she told me that she gets why I refused, but if she were in my shoes she wouldn't refuse (And I'm 100% sure she wouldn't).\n\nThe reasons I didn't agree: First of all, I don't know her and she didn't even introduce herself or gave me her flat number. Secondly, our network is old and my flat meter may overload if she plugs several appliances in extension cord (it has 3 plugs) and I can't control it coz it would be in her flat. Thirdly, I would have to shoulder the bill fow how much she would use. Fourthly, I would have to keep my apartment door unlocked for the extension and I wouldn't feel safe.\nI used my Hb as an excuse coz I was shocked somewhat.\n\nWhy I think I may be an AH is coz the kid's health was involved and they have no electricity for 5-6 days now.\n\nEdit: added fourth reason not to agree", "created_utc": 1694867023, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16k6968/aita_for_not_letting_neighbors_use_my_electricity/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She could have gone to the neighbours SHE knows instead of a stranger.\n\n\\- As she is without electricity, HOW LONG would she be using yours, had you agreed?\n\n\\- Also, as she has no electricity at all, what other appliances would she have connected to YOUR electricity: fridge, cellphone charger, lights in the evening, etc.etc.\n\nNTA", "They chose not to pay the bill.

You think you may be the a hole because a mom and dad with a sick child who uses electrical medical equipment decided to\u2026not pay their electric bill and are now putting it off on you as your fault?!?! Who is really at fault? Who is really responsible? I\u2019m assuming here they didn\u2019t just quadruple your bill at once and they were willing to work things out. (I\u2019m not even sure how that works. The elevator should have been factored into the cost of rent. But maybe this is your country specific. How did that work for people who just moved in? Did they pay the same amount as someone who had been living there 10 years? Just random curiosity.) NTA. You didn\u2019t feel comfortable. Mom and dad should have thought of this when they decided not to pay the electric bill.", "Nta.", "Seems as though she should have paid the bill or tried to make arrangements with the company if her child was reliant on a plugged in device.

NTA, you don\u2019t know who she is, if she even has a kid or what she\u2019ll be plugging in. Just because she said she has a kid on an inhaler doesn\u2019t mean she does, could just be a hustle to get some free power from the new guys.

All of us were warned about being cut off for not playing", "Exactly, she never gave me her name or flat number plus I was still drowsy from my nap which didn't make communication easier.\n\nThe only reason I feel like crap is coz of a small kid. I'm a teacher, childfree by choice but still have a soft spot for kids... And I've seen a ton of sweet kids who had very crappy parents(((\n\n\nEdit:\nAlso, they were cut off starting Monday. Today is Sat, that means she managed to get by somehow\n\n\nI have no idea if it was a one time ask or not, she didn't specify. \n\nI would have no way to check what she would plug into an extension coz the receiver would be inside her apartment.", "Thx. Yeah, I mean the bill was pretty big and unexpected. But I know that neighbors who payed at least part if it - weren't cut off. Only those who didn't pay a dime did.", "They did basically quadruple it. They did it at the end of June. So we had to cover June's usage and their new bill. I talked with company and was told that they will take action only after the 10th of Sept. So we paid our monthly bill plus some extra every month.\n\nThey didn't care when you moved in, technically common electricity wasn't charged for 5-10 years coz of poor management company. Now they hired another company and they double checked house meter (the general one) and split up the cost between all flats. Normally  it should be charged together with flat electricity usage. But there was a mistake so they bill was never issued. Now they took down the numbers and names it June's bill... messy, but legal(((\n\nWe don't rent, we own our flat and pay our own appliances by flat meters (electricity and water) and also house electricity and water, but usually it's a very small bill, less then a burger at MC. We were cherged for water fine, but the not for general electricity. So that's how sum build up so much\n\nAs it was done in June, it's counted as June's bill so the date people moved out is irrelevant. We double checked with a lawyer.\n\nI'm not sure if they have a dad of if she is a single mom. I don't even know what flat she is from", "Pretty much, she didn't flash the cord, vut told me she was planning to use it. Urf, the only reason I feel like crap is coz of possible kids health.\n\nDouble checked house chat (my Hb was added), no one said they needed help with electricity, they mostly discuss if they can turn it back on themselves, without paying a fee...", "*< they were cut off starting Monday. Today is Sat, that means she managed to get by somehow >*\n\nSo she had ample time to change her mind about paying and getting reconnected to the grid.\n\nShe's probably been mooching of other neighbours since Monday, and now it was your turn to give electricity, using her kid as a reason for you to give it to her.\n\nHer kid should have been a reason for HER to pay the damn bill.", "It was more of a if someone moved in 2 months ago why are they covering old electric bills. But this sounds like a condo and a \u201cspecial assessment\u201d kinda thing. They still gave you time to pay it. Not all paid within a week\u2019s time or no electricity. It was still a choice made.", "You don\u2019t even know if there really is a kid, and even if there is she could have paid a token amount to keep the power on, so don\u2019t feel bad, it\u2019s not your responsibility. Probably just someone cadging power to keep their bills down at your expense.", "You are right", "Yeah, you are correct.\nAnd paying even part of it guaranteed not to be cut off", "So\u2026not your llama.
