I\u2019ve mentioned to her nicely to change before but she keeps doing it. The other night she did it again and I just simply said, cover up. She got angry and said she lived there too and accused me of being worried my husband would sexualize her. I told her that is definitely not the case, but there was a young child in this home and it wasn\u2019t appropriate, she needed to cover up before leaving her room. We got into an argument and I basically said you could run around your room naked for all I care, but once you leave the bedroom you need to be covered. She didn\u2019t like that and has been avoiding me in the house the past few days.

I felt comfortable around my dad because he treated me like a daughter and I didn\u2019t have a pervy dad in the slightest. But I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay. My mom also had a hard childhood and she had a pervy step dad so there are very real fears that are instilled in women and for my mom that was at a young age. Others I can see are disagreeing, but they were probably raised different. I think sports bra and booty shorts are fine. But if she is walking out in just her panties that\u2019s too much. I\u2019ve lived in a house with all women and walking around in just underwear was fine by me, but it\u2019s important when living with other people to listen to their comfort level.

Yet here we have countless redditors who likely rarely go outside let alone interface with young beautiful women, or simply, people, claiming she\u2019s being unjustly sexualized when she specifically wears those clothing (as do other girls) in order to feel sexually attractive. \n\nFucking drones.", "I understand the sake of the kid part. OP and Husband live the way they want and are raising their child to also dress with that level of modesty. It makes sense that OP doesn\u2019t want someone living under their roof dressing with a lesser level of modesty.\n\nI give OP the benefit of the doubt because she has already shown herself to be kind and generous as she is hosting her sister in her home free of charge and the sister has her own room and is also fed. Not many people would open their home like that!   \n\nIt is a very small ask to have her sister not walk around in the group spaces scantily dressed!", "i agree with you. i was actually surprised to see so many nta posts. i feel like a lot of it is culture and how people grew up- like i still wear a big t-shirt and underwear when i\u2019m at my moms house and it\u2019s not weird because it\u2019s never been deemed inappropriate.", "This isn\u2019t ESH. \n\nOP is allowed to be modest in clothing choices. That does not make her an AH. \n\nWhat would make someone an AH is living rent free in a family members house and then after being asked to cover up, refusing to do so. \n\nDoesn\u2019t really matter the reason.", "So if she paid rent it would b okay for her to walk around the house completely bare ass naked coochie lips out and all is what ur saying?", "Lol yeah, When I was a child and even now when I'm visiting my parents, it's completely normal for people to be wearing only t-shirts and underwear when waking up and making breakfast in the common areas for example. Even when my girlfriend is visiting with me.\n\nI've also seen like 70% of my friends naked at one point or another (men and women). But I guess that's just Finnish sauna culture.", "Idk.

They\u2019re just stupid human bodies.", "Where does it say she\u2019s seeing it other than a sports bra (which people wear in public? An oversized t-shirt is going to cover the underwear.

At 4 my kids were just starting to come out of their (as I like to call it) \"little nudist phase\" that all toddlers go through as soon as they figure out how to rip their diaper off.   So could understand OP wanting Sis to wear more clothing simply because like it or not she is a role model, and no one wants to deal with \"I don't want to wear pants!\"  \"Auntie isn't wearing pants!\"  \"It's NOT FAIR!!\"", "You stay covered all the time? Like you\u2019re never outside of your room in less than pants and a full shirt. You never walk to the bathroom in a robe or leave in an towell. You never wear a bathing suit or a short dress?", "She also said \"Just a robe\" which may be just that and nothing under.", "They\u2019re insane. They would probably try to justify it no matter what even if she was naked.

That\u2019s absurd.", "Maybe they\u2019re Never-Nudes.", "I mean that\u2019s not completely outlandish. Some families are more traditional/modest. That\u2019s just their culture and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Personally, I prefer to be able to walk to the kitchen in my underwear and a t shirt but my family is more conservative. They don\u2019t leave our rooms without pajamas on. Certainly not in underwear/booty shorts and considering *I live there rent free*, I follow their preferences because it\u2019s not that hard to throw on a pair of pants because of house rules", "Wait, what's wrong with a house coat? Doesn't it cover more than enough?", "As a former female Resident Assistant, people do this in dorms all the time so definitely okay in that setting. It was some time ago now, but the go to lounge/sleepwear was a long tshirt, no pants for girls. But a dorm is a very different environment. You have a collective group of 18-20 year olds typically all one gender in a single hall. There\u2019s very much the ongoing feel of everyone knows there\u2019s no children/siblings here, no parents around to say anything, just young adults thrown into close quarters together who don\u2019t care much of what others wear, or lack there of. Had the sister lived in a dorm, no one would scold her but the way some students act in a dorm is not likely the way they\u2019d act at home\u2026 \n\nOn one hand sister is dressing the way the rest of her cohort does and I think for that reason perhaps she feels she is probably missing out on that laid back, YA only experience. But it is OPs house and she\u2019s being very generous to let her sister live their rent free as college is expensive. Think they should talk out some underlying tensions.", "Because people tend to be embarrassed about their insecurities. The kid is an easy cop out.", "This is a good way i think. My kids are 4 and 1. They are both boys. And, oh my, we shower together! Behold, i'm a female! Guess what, they don't care at all. And that's the right thing. I think kids should know how a human body looks and that there are two different versions of it. They can take a shower with me or see me change clothes as long as they don't show discomfort. Then they can go shower alone, there are doors that can be closed, you get the point.", "Yup. Her house, her rules fair enough. We all get it. .

This year I\u2019m in a different position, but today I filled in for a first grade teacher and many of her students were my former students (who watched my pregnancy progress and were explicitly told that I was gone at the end of the year because I had my baby). Several of them kept coming up to me, poking my belly, and asking me if it was a boy or a girl. When I showed them pictures of my now 9 moth old and told them he was a boy, they were quite shocked that he wasn\u2019t still in my belly. \ud83e\udd23 Guess I\u2019ve still got some work to do to get in shape. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I feel like I'd care less about the stripping if it wasn't him trying to strip in public or screaming for help \"mama help pants off no pants help pants!\" At the store in the car, or it wasn't mad dashes out the front door whenever a delivery driver stopped by or someone else opened the door.", "But it isn't her house.

I don't think it is a far stretch to assume she is doing it for attention.\n\nThe discomfort is probably not even sexual, she just placed that label on it (bc that's how she wants ppl to see her).

I wasn't talking about anything sexual at all, but he turned a conversation about diversity efforts at the office that way out of left field.  Like, what?\n\nI was wearing an ultra-preppy outfit that I could see either of my grandmothers having worn.  We were the only ones in the room.\n\nIf a guy's gonna get creepy, it doesn't make that much of a difference whether you're wearing booty shorts or a Lilly Pulitzer skirt.

My sister owns a house with my husband and me. They get along great. There is zero attraction there on either side. But neither of them walks around the house in their underwear. Or if they have a reason to (like we are currently having to shower down the hall so my husband often makes that short trek in his boxers), they make sure the coast is clear first. \n\nIt can be uncomfortable to be around other people in their underwear even if it\u2019s not an attraction phase. And if you\u2019re staying in someone\u2019s house rent free, just put some clothes on out of respect.", "I was thinking while the kid may or may not be an excuse it seems to be making op uncomfortable in her own home which is a valid reason to ask her to put on some more clothes.

They\u2019ve developed their own senses of modesty but still think nothing of engaging me in conversation while I\u2019m on the toilet.  They saw less of their mom nude so that freaks them out a bit more.  Either way, seeing Dad semi nude around the house on occasion is just the way it is.", "100%  I grew up around my mother who was the same way. It was normal to change and be naked wround others. I grew up with 3 sisters and a mom. A body is just a body. I talked to her while she was changing, taking a bath, etc. That level of visibility was normal and comfortable to me because it wasn't sexual. It was weird being exposed to the world and people thinking it was weird to change in front of each other. We're all just bodies man. But I understand people aren't all comfortable with it and that's okay. Its a tricky situation.", "My daughter was in my bedroom last night while I was having a shower.
