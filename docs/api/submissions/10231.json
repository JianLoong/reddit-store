I\u2019ve mentioned to her nicely to change before but she keeps doing it. The other night she did it again and I just simply said, cover up. She got angry and said she lived there too and accused me of being worried my husband would sexualize her. I told her that is definitely not the case, but there was a young child in this home and it wasn\u2019t appropriate, she needed to cover up before leaving her room. We got into an argument and I basically said you could run around your room naked for all I care, but once you leave the bedroom you need to be covered.

I felt comfortable around my dad because he treated me like a daughter and I didn\u2019t have a pervy dad in the slightest. But I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay. My mom also had a hard childhood and she had a pervy step dad so there are very real fears that are instilled in women and for my mom that was at a young age. Others I can see are disagreeing, but they were probably raised different. I think sports bra and booty shorts are fine. But if she is walking out in just her panties that\u2019s too much. I\u2019ve lived in a house with all women and walking around in just underwear was fine by me, but it\u2019s important when living with other people to listen to their comfort level.

Especially family. You want them to feel comfortable. Guess what I said was unpopular.", "Good manners to do what?

I\u2019m not saying \u2018expose\u2019 your child to explicitly sexual things, but existing as a women is not explicitly sexual unless you teach your kids it is, which is what OP  seems to be doing.

OP can see whatever ridiculous and asinine rules they want since it\u2019s their home. That doesn\u2019t make the rules any less ridiculous or asanine.

We aren't seriously going to police what she wears under her robe that we can't see are we?", "A big shirt is basically a dress. Booty shorts are not the same as underwear. Obviously, if OP doesn\u2019t like it, she can set whatever rules she likes, but that doesn\u2019t make her any less of an AH for sexualizing her little sister and her own son. YTA imo.", "I know it\u2019s ridiculous. I swear this sub will immediately disagree with anyone who in anyway dares abridge any perceived rights of any young independent woman. Without recognizing that hey maybe OP just isn\u2019t fucking comfortable with a half naked person chilling in her living room. \n\nThis sub is infuriating sometimes. Half the time they project their personal values as if that\u2019s the only way to see the world.", "Yeah I mean my husband and I wear underwear in our home all the time, but my brother or his brother moved in, I would not continue to lounge in underwear. I think there is a difference between lounging that way with your spouse, partner, or if rooming with a close friend, but not so around people you don\u2019t have that close bond with like the BIL. To me it\u2019s more about decency than specialization.", "The woman I replied to specifically stated she is not worried about her husband or her son seeing her 3 year old naked. My point is, yeah no duh. It is irrelevant to make that comparison to OP\u2019s adult sister.

If someone in the house feels uncomfortable about her walking around in booty shorts or underwear, they can either change or think about moving out. \n\nIt\u2019s really not that hard to not walk around in underwear. Who in their right mind even does that? \n\nIt\u2019s just about respect.

That's exactly what OP is worried about. The excuse with the kid makes absolutely no sense.", "Why are you sure of that?", "OMG this! It is about being respectful! Why should OP have to be uncomfortable in her own house when she is helping out her sister with a place to live.", "So you agree that OP hasn't given any reason to think the environment is unsafe for a child? Given that OP has said what she thinks the issue is, and that it isn't something that is in any way unsafe or inappropriate for a child, then there is no reason to think there is any risk to the child's safety here.", "Yeah... but since we are just guessing without any proof, what if op is a bit resentful that sister is not paying rent or contributing anything and everything sister does could be seen as wrong at this point?", "And you're gross. I live with men and wear underwear around in my own home. They have the decency to not objectify me in the comfort of my own home wearing underwear. Do you have the common decency to do the same? Doesn't sound like it", "Then why don't us Lesbians do that? I don't care if a woman is wearing underwear around me. I'm just not disgusting enough to objectify them. I don't sexualize women no matter what they wear, yet I'm sexually attracted to women. Please explain how I can control myself, and you can't", "I agree that OP\u2019s demand is unreasonable, but it\u2019s also unreasonable to leech of siblings with zero regard to their comfort.", "That\u2019s not shaming. That\u2019s different people having different boundaries. And if someone else is going to house you, you\u2019re going to need to abide to their boundaries. OP isn\u2019t her parent so there is no obligation to house the sister. If sister doesn\u2019t like having to dress modestly in OPs house, then she should move out. (Edit to add; saw in OPs comments that sister doesn\u2019t pay rent or pay for groceries or anything. OP is housing her out of the kindness of her own heart. The LEAST she could do is is stop walking around the shared spaces in revealing clothes.)\n\nAnd I say this as someone who is practically a nudist in her own home. So it\u2019s not like I\u2019m a prude. I\u2019m just actually an adult so I understand and respect the fact that not everyone has the same boundaries as I do.

She's not walking around naked, she's wearing more than a bikini would cover, so the kid has probably seen more skin on strangers at the swimming pool, so what's the problem with sis being comfortable in the place where she's living? Why should she have to be body shamed in her own home? Tell me OP's an AH that obviously doesn't really want her sister there without telling me that OP's an AH that obviously doesn't want her sister there. She should just say it instead of being passive aggressive and acting like her sister's body is the issue here.", "I understand what you\u2019re saying.

Also not entirely appropriate IMO because robes slip open very easily.", "I'm assuming by that you mean she does not pay utilities and whatnot and no rent. Once a month to babysit for an hour does not equal rent. For me it's NTA.   It is your home and so she needs to respect reasonable requests.", "NAH imo, I get why she\u2019s upset but she\u2019s living there rent free. Your house your rules.", "I don\u2019t think it matters in the least what the financial arrangement is stop being shitty about someone else\u2019s body", "Sounds like your issues are more about her contribution than attire.

The guy above me said that any guy will look at an attractive wearing wearing underwear. I agreed. I don't think this demonstrates a lack of control or is inappropriate. It's human nature regardless of your sex or sexual preferences.\n\nI don't think that's about self control.

You're extrapolating massively - OP didn't say she wears a robe which often falls open so she flashes my husband with her tits, OP just said she wears a robe which is an item that exists to be put over pajamas for warmth and modesty e.g. if you need to quickly open the door to sign for a parcel delivery. OPs judgement of what's inappropriate to wear is so far off reasonable that something else must be going on (maybe she's worried husband is eying up sister and decided asking sister to wear hessian sacks is easier than actually confronting husband, maybe it's something else entirely, but once you're complaining about someone wearing a dressing gown you're clearly beyond reason).", "I think there's not uniform agreement on this being a \"reasonable request.\"\n\nHey, don't walk around naked... reasonable request.\n\nHey, don't wear what is totally normal beach and athletic wear... not reasonable request.", "This is a bullshit take. If I am nice enough to allow you to live in the home I pay for, for free, you can accommodate the most basic expectations I have. Don't like it? Leave.
