Why was she so hyper focused on you instead of just getting on with and enjoying her event? You didn't make a scene, as you went outside to take the call. Also why was she trying to make you drink? \n\nI guess once she has children she'll see for herself what it's like being a parent.

Those kids are your main priority now.  You haven't said how they ended up in your care but whether it was removal from parents, parents gave them up or parents died, they are going to have trauma from it.  They are going to have a fear of abandonment and in all likelihood an insecure attachment to you and your husband as their new primary caregivers.  It can take years for kids in new family units to settle enough to be left with a babysitter or alternative family members.\n\nYour friend is valid to feel whatever she felt, what she isn't valid in is blaming you for ruining her night, accusing you of being better than her and trying to make you the bad person in the situation. Your friendship group will no longer be as high of priority now, and they need to adjust to that and support you or bow out of your life.  She ruined her own night by creating unnecessary drama.", "NTA, but don't go to events you can't commit to properly in future, it's worse than not going.", "Unless you are not telling the whole story... NTA\n\nDid you make a scene, did you loudly announce to the whole room that you had to call the kids? I assume not. You were late but you apologized for that. All in all no behaviour that \"ruins the whole night\".\n\nAnd honestly ... why is she so focused on you when it is her engagement party? Maybe let her cool down and talk again if you feel like it.", "NTA, she made you the center of her event by centering you at every turn. She begged you to come knowing you have different responsibilities now. \nYou didn't take the call in the middle of the event. You stepped away. You told her you weren't drinking, and she kept pushing. It seems like she has more pinned-up feelings than she is leading on.", "NTA. You decline an invitation, she begged you to come, and you did to make her happy. Yes you were late but you were there, which is what matters. Also 10 min to calm down a child is not much, let alone two. If your presence was mandatory for the speech, you should have been informed before leaving or they could have waited. What if instead of a call you had to go to the bathroom, or anything the like? \n\nAlso I hate people trying to force you to drink, parents or not, no matter the context, being intoxicated should be a choice.", "NTA.  I'm still trying to figure out why she was so hyper focused on you that it ruined her party.  Unless you made some grand production when you walked in late, loudly proclaimed for all to hear that your kids needed you to call them, made some kind of scene about not drinking, nothing you did should have ruined her night.  Even if the speech you missed had something specific to you in it, that still doesn't equal a ruined party for her.  Maybe she is already super stressed about something else, and took it out on you because you were an easy target.  Still not excuse though.  Sorry your friend sucks.", "NTA  Your friend seems to think the universe revolves around her and she should have your complete, undivided attention.  She sounds awful.\n\nThat you are uninvited from the wedding is a blessing, you will be better off without her in your life. Good luck with the boys, sounds like therapy all round would be helpful.", "NTA. Your friend is incredibly selfish and her night being \u201cruined\u201d is on her and her entitled attitude, not on you.", "NTA.\n\nYou say your friends understand, even her, but they clearly don't, especially her. Someone being late to a party is not a reason for the host to be upset. Someone not drinking at a party is not a reason for the host to be upset. Someone stepping out for a few minutes is not a reason for the host to be upset.\n\nEvery friend that thinks you ruined her party and hurt her doesn't get it. They are the assholes. You owe none of them an apology. But you need to ask yourself if they still deserve a space in your life. That type of negativity is never needed, ESPECIALLY in your situation.", "NTA at all, I can only imagine the stress of taking on two traumatized 5 year olds when having kids was never on the table in the first place, and while I would normally day it\u2019s good for kids to occasionally have their parents go out and have adult time, in this instance these kiddos are clearly not ready for that. Your friend should absolutely be more understanding. You are doing an amazing thing giving those kiddos a stable, safe, loving home. \n\nWith that said, I am wondering if your friend is lashing out because if an internalized fear of losing you. Not saying her behavior is right, but have you been unintentionally neglecting your friendships due to this major change. She may feel like she never gets to see you or spend time with you anymore and not know how to express that in a healthy way, or may be subconsciously lashing out and not even realize it\u2019s stemming from something deeper.  Just something to think about. Again it does not justify her actions, but it could explain them a little. I would suggest reaching out and not apologizing, but saying something like, hey your friendship really means a lot to me, and I know that with the kids I am just not available like I used to be, but that does not make our friendship less important to me. That is I am assuming that this is an important relationship to you.", "It was not a wedding", "OP declined the invitation! She went purely because of how much pressure the friend was putting on her by making her feel guilty.", "No scene or loud announcement, I just told the friend I was sitting with that I was stepping out for a moment and that\u2019s it.", "True this. But I have always been mystified by people getting upset because someone at a party is not drinking alcohol. I have seen parties get ruined by drunks, but never by people being sober.", "NTA. I'm CF and my husband is too. Her response is childish. There's no real reason you being a tiny bit late and not drinking should upset her this much. There's something she's not been telling anyone, I can't imagine what, but something.\n\nAlso, I really hope your nephews are in therapy for whatever they've been through. I'm sure you and your husband are doing the best you can but them crying because you're going out for a few hours without them is concerning.", "Bride sound like the type who thinks the guests need to put heir lives on hold for a whole year until the Grand Wedding happens!\n\nHow dare you CARE about your kids while she, the only  worthy and bestest bride to be, is partying OP! \n\nNTA of course. If your friends make you question this, drop them too. Your kids come first. Hope they're in therapy to help them cope. You're a good parent.", "NTA at all. When we adopted our nephew (3 at the time) we thought he would be ok at daycare bc he was previously going. He screamed and cried for hours in a way that breaks your heart, so much so that we couldn\u2019t leave, at least one of us needed to be with him. Your friend doesn\u2019t understand this, and that\u2019s ok; but it\u2019s not ok for her to treat you like your current situation isn\u2019t important. Time to find some new friends with kids.", "NTA cheese and rice, she seems awful. Telling you to   fuck off for taking a phone call from your fragile kids? Holy crap. You may not think you're better than her, but I certainly do. Because she sucks.", "NTA, even CF can understand the *2 traumatized children who need extra attention* point. I'm a CF myself and many of my friends are, in a similar situation all we would do and expect is support for the children.\n\nYour friend seemed to be competing with them, and judging by your other friends' reaction, she must have spread her pov around. It is possible you previously hurt her without realizing it, it is possible you previously dismissed something. Or it is possible she's just a childish person who is good at convincing others about her view, because tbh this is what seems to be from her behavior, since the begging to come to the drinking thing", "Your friend sounds like she\u2019s obsessed with you. How in the world does one person coming late or taking a 10 min phone call, or not drinking somehow ruined her night? That\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nAnyway NTA and her uninviting you is a win in my books", "Your friend sound less mature than your nephews. She needs to grow up. NTA", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry your friend is hurt, but your life has changed. You have different priorities and responsibilities and if she can't understand that, then maybe it's best that you guys put some distance between you. \n\nI truly don't understand how you being late and missing a speech ruined her night. She should've been focused on having fun rather than what you were doing.", "NTA.  Your friend doesn't sound mature enough to get engaged. God help her future partner", "It looks like you attract the adult codependent crybabies, too.", "You don't need friends like her.", "No, you're not the asshole. I, however, would be questioning why your friend is so deeply focused on you that you stepping out of a party that involved a bunch of people all there specifically for HER ruined her entire night. That's a strange attachment she's got there.", "Who needs enemies with friends like these. NTA\n\nYou have traumatized children who rely on you, yet you made an effort to appear despite that, and politely excused yourself to deal with the issue, then returned to continue to celebrate...\n\nI think you went above and beyond. I can't imagine how full your spoons must feel right now. \n\nAll the best to you and your family! Keep your chin up, you're doing awesome.", "Don't you dare apologize\n\nNTA... but damn your \"friend\" isn't much of a friend. Trying to make your drink after you've said no? Princess much? Does she have other narc tendencies?", "There's no real reason you being a tiny bit late and not drinking should upset her this much.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm sure from the sounds of it you're an amazing person to be stepping up to parent your two boys. \n\nI was treated in a similar way at an (ex I'm afraid) friends engagement party. I had had my first kid and I was also incredibly unwell with a chronic illness. However I made a massive effort to attend the event.  Like you I made no fuss or mention about it, I just showed up but I didn't drink and I like you I stepped out to talk to my husband briefly as our baby was really upset. Like you I just politely excused myself for 5 mins.   \n\nShe treated me like crap for the rest of the event, completely shunning me and making a point not to talk to me.  She then also seemed to get pissed off that despite this I was fine because my two best friends were there.  She'd become friends with them because the three of them had been my bridesmaids. My best friends couldn't really work out why they were at the engagement party because they didn't feel close to my other friend but nonetheless they were there and so I just hung out with them since my friend wasn't talking to me.\n\nShe was absolutely horrendous to me afterwards and then I didn't turn up to the wedding (I did remain invited to it) because I was quite literally in hospital very unwell with the illness I'd been struggling with at the engagement thing.....\n\nShe's not spoken to me since and that was about 8 years ago now.  I don't feel like I've lost anything because if that's the way someone's going to treat me well they can do one!\n\nI'm sorry that this has happened to you and like... I can totally sympathise with you - it did feel shitty at the time and I'm sure that it was even more challenging for you with the situation with your nephews and the things you mentioned (not being able to leave them with sitters etc). \n\nHopefully you can smooth over this with the people that you want to remain friends with and can re-evaluate those who are treating you poorly. You deserve more", "OMG you didn\u2019t get a piece of furniture, you are now parenting 2 living human beings.

So a little extra TLC is okay. You made time to go even if you were a bit late you still showed. She should have respected you aren\u2019t drinking. I hate that people think you have to drink to have a good time at a party/event. A lot changed when you\u2019re a parent and you\u2019re an unplanned parent to twin boys at an already hard age for children.", "NTA\nYou've been uninvited. Take it as a win.\nThe friend is childish and her enjoyment of her special evening shouldn't hinge so much on you.", "Yikes.\n\nMassive NTA.\n\nSounds like wedding is causing her to lose her mind. But it's not your problem. Keep it polite so when she comes up for air she'll realise its all her fault.", "NTA. If this is the whole story then you did nothing to ruin her evening. Coming late or stepping outside for a moment is nothing uncommon at parties. \nMaybe there is something else going on, maybe she is jealous or something like that with your new family life.

I hope that helps.", "I think it's due to the trauma the kids went through. OP didn't say what it is, but obviously, if they have custody of them, they lost their parents in some way. Whatever the reason they lost them is, it really is triggering to them because they cried when they saw OP getting ready to leave. So my guess is they were upset that she was gone and the husband called OP so she could assure them that she's coming back. I could be wrong, but that's what it seems like to me. The reason i think this is because she meantioned that a sitter is not an option for the kids due to the trauma, so i think it's the kids having issues with a parent leaving.

I can only imagine what they may have experienced. These boys probably feel so safe and secure with OP which is a good thing.

That\u2019s just life.", "Unfortunately, this sort of self centered weirdness seems all too common these days, even among full grown adults.", "Wow. This is a tour de force. Well said! \ud83c\udfc6", "It sounds like the kids suffered some trauma, hopefully OP and partner can get them therapy and work towards being able to use a babysitter or family member in the future, but it sounds like right now that\u2019s just not possible.", "Do you have the spoons to recommend any tools or books for working through trauma after being gaslit and cheated on for a long time", "Do you offer online sessions (like zoom or whatever?) Or can recommend people/places that do? Asking for a friend \ud83d\udc40", "How long is a session?", "Nor does she sound mature enough to be married. Marriage is compromize and open communication. She has expressed non of these behaviors.", "Whatever the reason is, it doesn't why the husband called OP.  That's what i was trying to get at. They are still new parents and to traumatized children so if he called his wife it shouldn't be a problem especially since they didn't want her to leave him calling her could have been related. No matter what we suspected he had a right to call his wife for help.", "Yep. When I stopped drinking, I lost SO many friends. It doesn't bother me to be around people drinking, I will still have fun. But some people thought I was being judgemental by not drinking...I told them that was on them, not me.", "\"Yeah I found out I have seizures. I'm not supposed to drink on the medicine, because it causes problems. I found out drinking makes me have seizures, and I end up being a problem because I'm inebriated and out of it from the seizure.\"\n\n\"Its just a free shot! Don't be a buzzkill.\"\n\n\"I could literally die from it, and kill someone else in the process.\"\n\n\"Asshole you're ruining my birthday!\" ***Begins sobbing dramatically.***  \n\n\nI wish this was a joke instead of an actual exchange that I've had.", "I am sorry the people you socialize with are such jerks. I grew up in a country where social drinking is super common and I now live in a place (and time, I guess) where it's less of a thing, and lots of people don't drink, but I would never comment on either choice adversely. I sometimes invite people for summer drinks on my patio, and if they say \"I don't drink alcohol\" I will give them non-alcoholic options, or say \"this punch has Pimms in it, that one is lemonade\". Nothing else.", "Agreed. \"Light jabs\" add up and can easily make people decide not to spend time with you anymore, even if they also play the comments off with laughs.", "I'm with you. People who pick on people for not drinking are just assholes. It's not funny, it's not a character flaw, and throwing out lame excuses for being sober is just you being an asshole. I'm not pregnant, I'm not a recovering alcoholic, I just told you \"no.\" It's pretty damn pathetic to try to guilt me into drinking.\n\nAnd it isn't just light jabs with no feelings hurt. You are ostracizing someone who thought you were a friend.\n\nPisses me off beyond belief.", "exactly this. i used to be big on partying and drinking when i was single, i got i to a relationship 2 years ago and honestly, its just not that enjoyable to me anymore. my friends are BIG drinkers and partiers and i\u2019ve stopped hanging out with them almost completely because of those \u201clight jabs\u201d. they may seem like nothing to them, but when they\u2019re coming from the people who are supposed to care about and support you and be your friends, it really starts to ruin the friendship. how am i ruining your night because i choose to only have 1 drink and not get plastered like everyone else?", "Amen to this. Please stop with the \u201clight\u201d\u2018or otherwise jabs.", "Non-drinking women are constantly pestered with questions about pregnancy. Because there's no other reason for a woman not to drink. /s", "Maybe ppl have internal insecurities", "I used to be as self centered like the bride to be. I still am self centered but a little less so as I have gotten older because I realized over time that it\u2019s better to be giving and generous and understanding and considerate and not so focused on my own feelings.  There\u2019s a time and place to process and deal with my feelings but reacting as soon as my feelings bubble up is not the wisest way of dealing with them.", "My standard sessions are up to 60 minutes but clients can request for sessions to end earlier if they're talked out.  I'm also happy to negotiate up to a 90 minute session if clients regularly come dysregulated and/or need more time to talk.", "Yeah I still drink from time to time, but there are times where drinking would be dangerous for me. And people are still \"Oh one little drink won't hurt.\" Like it absolutely could and I'm not risking it because you are way too invested what I'm doing.", "My mom (Boomer) told me many many years ago that partiers (usually) don't like non-partiers because they're useless to them. They stop hanging out with you because you don't have what they want (this applies to both drugs and alcohol). \n\nI've found with alcohol/drinking, that somewhere in the late 1990s-2000s or so the 'common wisdom' developed that you can't trust someone who doesn't drink. I assume some jerky comedian came up with this 'truth' and people ran with it because it rationalizes their behavior (drinking) and makes them feel superior (drinkers can be trusted/nondrinkers can't). Meanwhile, designated drivers are kind of important. And the sober person in the group usually makes sure everyone else is okay.", "Kinda weird", "Sadly I'm not surprised. I had a friend in my early 30s who was like that. I put up with her bs for years until one day I was like \"That's it. I'm done. I'm not going to be friends with someone who clearly does not care about my health.\" As I was walking home I got a bunch of texts about how she was so relieved not to have to be friends with a drama queen anymore. Since then I've seen her here and there and she always tries to be super friendly and suggest we meet up for brunch. And I'm always distantly vague and leave as quickly as possible.", "Good fucking god, you need better friends.", "Thank you. It's not an issue with my current social circle, but more when I've gone to large gatherings with family where it's an issue.", "I love drinking around sober people, \u201chey buddy take me to taco bell!\u201d", "Jim Gaffigan had a skit about this. Nobody ever bothers you if you decline mayonnaise. They don't assume you're a recovering mayo addict. They don't pressure you into eating mayo.

Soft drinks exist you know\" \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude09 Everyone had a little chuckle, that was that and a good night was had by all and he was super happy mocking us all the next day for being drunk and/or hungover \ud83e\udd23", "Agree", "This. Before my relationship, I used to love to get plastered and pass out somewhere random. Putting the pieces together from photos was so much fun. My ex roommate and I tried to go out after my boyfriend and I got together, but being her wingman, up til 5 am, and ending up somewhere random where I got drugged was not fun. It felt like a chore. I would happily go to class hung over when I did for my own enjoyment but now I would rather watch a movie in bed with my partner.", "Yep. Like, if you go to a party and they're serving hamburgers and hot dogs, and you decide to eat a hot dog, no one's going to pester you about why you didn't get a hamburger. So why should it be any different for alcohol?", "It\u2019s because when you\u2019re hanging out with people who have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol, they feel personally attacked when you don\u2019t drink as much as them. Oftentimes they know deep down that their drinking is problematic and think that people who don\u2019t drink as much are judging them (whether it\u2019s true or not.) It also makes them face an uncomfortable truth that drinking and partying isn\u2019t necessary for other people to have fun. \n\nMy parents are both alcoholics, thankfully in recovery, but anytime someone I know responds negatively to my light/non-drinking, I give them one chance to cut it out. If they respond by being rude or pushing the matter, I respond by avoiding them completely or avoiding them while they are drinking. Luckily 99% of the people in my life have been very chill about it\u2014mostly because they all have healthy relationships with alcohol.", "As a woman who does  not plan on having children, I feel this so much. My husband and I have been married almost 7 years and I think people are waiting for us to have kids. I got tired of always having to tell people I wasn't pregnant, but God, can you imagine how awful that would be for someone having trouble conceiving?", "agree", "You'll notice I used the past tense there, but also I'm almost 50.
