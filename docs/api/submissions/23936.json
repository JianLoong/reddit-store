What a shame. NTA", "NTA. what if OP had gone to the bathroom, would she still get chewed out? A phone call for a few minutes outside the room where party is taking place is not \"ruining\" anything. \nBride to be is a little self centered. Speeches at these events might mean a lot to the couple, but honestly are usually boring. You are fortunate to be Uninvited, you missed a lecture about  not coming to wedding or your behavior at wedding or something else she would be mad about.", "F her.....NTA", "Nta - why did you talking to husband/kids during her wedding and you not drinking ruin her wedding?  Weren\u2019t there other guests or was she just laser focused on you?  I guess your friends don\u2019t really understand, especially this now x friend.  Nta - I just don\u2019t think what you did was a big deal.  She overreacted and there has to be some underlying animosity on her part.", "NTA. Good grief!  This isn\u2019t a friend. I don\u2019t know what you should call her, but being uninvited to her wedding is a win in my book.", "NTA, for sure.  You stepped up to a bad situation and are doing your best for those two little ones.   Your friend sucks.", "NTA, for her to tell you to fuck off just for politely stepping out to take a call is just entirely inappropriate. She overreacted and now has ruined a good friendship. If she was sad about not being able to spend as much time together and wanted to express that to you, she could have done that. It\u2019s sad to see that she instead got angry and took things out on you.", "NTA I don't know why she was hurt that you turned up late. Fact is YOU TURNED UP! You could have not bothered to go at all and then what? You ruin her evening because you didn't show up? \n\nShe's not entitled to your time and I don't see what you did to actually 'hurt' her. Why was she so hyper focused on you instead of just getting on with and enjoying her event? You didn't make a scene, as you went outside to take the call. Also why was she trying to make you drink? \n\nI guess once she has children she'll see for herself what it's like being a parent. It's probably for the best she uninvited you, one less person you have to stress over in your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA - I'm saying this as someone who is passionately and happily childfree but also a therapist.  Those kids are your main priority now.  You haven't said how they ended up in your care but whether it was removal from parents, parents gave them up or parents died, they are going to have trauma from it.  They are going to have a fear of abandonment and in all likelihood an insecure attachment to you and your husband as their new primary caregivers.  It can take years for kids in new family units to settle enough to be left with a babysitter or alternative family members.\n\nYour friend is valid to feel whatever she felt, what she isn't valid in is blaming you for ruining her night, accusing you of being better than her and trying to make you the bad person in the situation. Your friendship group will no longer be as high of priority now, and they need to adjust to that and support you or bow out of your life.  She ruined her own night by creating unnecessary drama.", "NTA, but don't go to events you can't commit to properly in future, it's worse than not going.", "Unless you are not telling the whole story... NTA\n\nDid you make a scene, did you loudly announce to the whole room that you had to call the kids? I assume not. You were late but you apologized for that. All in all no behaviour that \"ruins the whole night\".\n\nAnd honestly ... why is she so focused on you when it is her engagement party? Maybe let her cool down and talk again if you feel like it.", "NTA, she made you the center of her event by centering you at every turn. She begged you to come knowing you have different responsibilities now. \nYou didn't take the call in the middle of the event. You stepped away. You told her you weren't drinking, and she kept pushing. It seems like she has more pinned-up feelings than she is leading on.", "NTA. You decline an invitation, she begged you to come, and you did to make her happy. Yes you were late but you were there, which is what matters. Also 10 min to calm down a child is not much, let alone two. If your presence was mandatory for the speech, you should have been informed before leaving or they could have waited. What if instead of a call you had to go to the bathroom, or anything the like? \n\nAlso I hate people trying to force you to drink, parents or not, no matter the context, being intoxicated should be a choice.", "NTA.  I'm still trying to figure out why she was so hyper focused on you that it ruined her party.  Unless you made some grand production when you walked in late, loudly proclaimed for all to hear that your kids needed you to call them, made some kind of scene about not drinking, nothing you did should have ruined her night.  Even if the speech you missed had something specific to you in it, that still doesn't equal a ruined party for her.  Maybe she is already super stressed about something else, and took it out on you because you were an easy target.  Still not excuse though.  Sorry your friend sucks.", "NTA  Your friend seems to think the universe revolves around her and she should have your complete, undivided attention.  She sounds awful.\n\nThat you are uninvited from the wedding is a blessing, you will be better off without her in your life. Good luck with the boys, sounds like therapy all round would be helpful.", "NTA. Your friend is incredibly selfish and her night being \u201cruined\u201d is on her and her entitled attitude, not on you.", "NTA.\n\nYou say your friends understand, even her, but they clearly don't, especially her. Someone being late to a party is not a reason for the host to be upset. Someone not drinking at a party is not a reason for the host to be upset. Someone stepping out for a few minutes is not a reason for the host to be upset.\n\nEvery friend that thinks you ruined her party and hurt her doesn't get it. They are the assholes. You owe none of them an apology. But you need to ask yourself if they still deserve a space in your life. That type of negativity is never needed, ESPECIALLY in your situation.", "NTA at all, I can only imagine the stress of taking on two traumatized 5 year olds when having kids was never on the table in the first place, and while I would normally day it\u2019s good for kids to occasionally have their parents go out and have adult time, in this instance these kiddos are clearly not ready for that. Your friend should absolutely be more understanding. You are doing an amazing thing giving those kiddos a stable, safe, loving home. \n\nWith that said, I am wondering if your friend is lashing out because if an internalized fear of losing you. Not saying her behavior is right, but have you been unintentionally neglecting your friendships due to this major change. She may feel like she never gets to see you or spend time with you anymore and not know how to express that in a healthy way, or may be subconsciously lashing out and not even realize it\u2019s stemming from something deeper.  Just something to think about. Again it does not justify her actions, but it could explain them a little. I would suggest reaching out and not apologizing, but saying something like, hey your friendship really means a lot to me, and I know that with the kids I am just not available like I used to be, but that does not make our friendship less important to me. That is I am assuming that this is an important relationship to you.", "It was not a wedding", "OP declined the invitation! She went purely because of how much pressure the friend was putting on her by making her feel guilty.", "No scene or loud announcement, I just told the friend I was sitting with that I was stepping out for a moment and that\u2019s it.", "True this. But I have always been mystified by people getting upset because someone at a party is not drinking alcohol. I have seen parties get ruined by drunks, but never by people being sober."]}
