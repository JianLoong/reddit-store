Why was she so hyper focused on you instead of just getting on with and enjoying her event? You didn't make a scene, as you went outside to take the call. Also why was she trying to make you drink? \n\nI guess once she has children she'll see for herself what it's like being a parent.

Those kids are your main priority now.  You haven't said how they ended up in your care but whether it was removal from parents, parents gave them up or parents died, they are going to have trauma from it.  They are going to have a fear of abandonment and in all likelihood an insecure attachment to you and your husband as their new primary caregivers.  It can take years for kids in new family units to settle enough to be left with a babysitter or alternative family members.\n\nYour friend is valid to feel whatever she felt, what she isn't valid in is blaming you for ruining her night, accusing you of being better than her and trying to make you the bad person in the situation. Your friendship group will no longer be as high of priority now, and they need to adjust to that and support you or bow out of your life.  She ruined her own night by creating unnecessary drama.", "NTA, but don't go to events you can't commit to properly in future, it's worse than not going.", "Unless you are not telling the whole story... NTA\n\nDid you make a scene, did you loudly announce to the whole room that you had to call the kids? I assume not. You were late but you apologized for that. All in all no behaviour that \"ruins the whole night\".\n\nAnd honestly ... why is she so focused on you when it is her engagement party? Maybe let her cool down and talk again if you feel like it.", "NTA, she made you the center of her event by centering you at every turn. She begged you to come knowing you have different responsibilities now. \nYou didn't take the call in the middle of the event. You stepped away. You told her you weren't drinking, and she kept pushing. It seems like she has more pinned-up feelings than she is leading on.", "NTA. You decline an invitation, she begged you to come, and you did to make her happy. Yes you were late but you were there, which is what matters. Also 10 min to calm down a child is not much, let alone two. If your presence was mandatory for the speech, you should have been informed before leaving or they could have waited. What if instead of a call you had to go to the bathroom, or anything the like? \n\nAlso I hate people trying to force you to drink, parents or not, no matter the context, being intoxicated should be a choice.", "NTA.  I'm still trying to figure out why she was so hyper focused on you that it ruined her party.  Unless you made some grand production when you walked in late, loudly proclaimed for all to hear that your kids needed you to call them, made some kind of scene about not drinking, nothing you did should have ruined her night.  Even if the speech you missed had something specific to you in it, that still doesn't equal a ruined party for her.  Maybe she is already super stressed about something else, and took it out on you because you were an easy target.  Still not excuse though.  Sorry your friend sucks.", "NTA  Your friend seems to think the universe revolves around her and she should have your complete, undivided attention.  She sounds awful.\n\nThat you are uninvited from the wedding is a blessing, you will be better off without her in your life. Good luck with the boys, sounds like therapy all round would be helpful.", "NTA. Your friend is incredibly selfish and her night being \u201cruined\u201d is on her and her entitled attitude, not on you.", "NTA.\n\nYou say your friends understand, even her, but they clearly don't, especially her. Someone being late to a party is not a reason for the host to be upset. Someone not drinking at a party is not a reason for the host to be upset. Someone stepping out for a few minutes is not a reason for the host to be upset.\n\nEvery friend that thinks you ruined her party and hurt her doesn't get it. They are the assholes. You owe none of them an apology. But you need to ask yourself if they still deserve a space in your life. That type of negativity is never needed, ESPECIALLY in your situation.", "NTA at all, I can only imagine the stress of taking on two traumatized 5 year olds when having kids was never on the table in the first place, and while I would normally day it\u2019s good for kids to occasionally have their parents go out and have adult time, in this instance these kiddos are clearly not ready for that. Your friend should absolutely be more understanding. You are doing an amazing thing giving those kiddos a stable, safe, loving home. \n\nWith that said, I am wondering if your friend is lashing out because if an internalized fear of losing you. Not saying her behavior is right, but have you been unintentionally neglecting your friendships due to this major change. She may feel like she never gets to see you or spend time with you anymore and not know how to express that in a healthy way, or may be subconsciously lashing out and not even realize it\u2019s stemming from something deeper.  Just something to think about. Again it does not justify her actions, but it could explain them a little. I would suggest reaching out and not apologizing, but saying something like, hey your friendship really means a lot to me, and I know that with the kids I am just not available like I used to be, but that does not make our friendship less important to me. That is I am assuming that this is an important relationship to you.", "It was not a wedding", "OP declined the invitation! She went purely because of how much pressure the friend was putting on her by making her feel guilty.", "No scene or loud announcement, I just told the friend I was sitting with that I was stepping out for a moment and that\u2019s it.", "True this. But I have always been mystified by people getting upset because someone at a party is not drinking alcohol. I have seen parties get ruined by drunks, but never by people being sober.", "NTA. I'm CF and my husband is too. Her response is childish. There's no real reason you being a tiny bit late and not drinking should upset her this much. There's something she's not been telling anyone, I can't imagine what, but something.\n\nAlso, I really hope your nephews are in therapy for whatever they've been through. I'm sure you and your husband are doing the best you can but them crying because you're going out for a few hours without them is concerning.", "Bride sound like the type who thinks the guests need to put heir lives on hold for a whole year until the Grand Wedding happens!\n\nHow dare you CARE about your kids while she, the only  worthy and bestest bride to be, is partying OP! \n\nNTA of course. If your friends make you question this, drop them too. Your kids come first. Hope they're in therapy to help them cope. You're a good parent.", "NTA at all. When we adopted our nephew (3 at the time) we thought he would be ok at daycare bc he was previously going. He screamed and cried for hours in a way that breaks your heart, so much so that we couldn\u2019t leave, at least one of us needed to be with him. Your friend doesn\u2019t understand this, and that\u2019s ok; but it\u2019s not ok for her to treat you like your current situation isn\u2019t important. Time to find some new friends with kids.", "NTA cheese and rice, she seems awful. Telling you to   fuck off for taking a phone call from your fragile kids? Holy crap. You may not think you're better than her, but I certainly do. Because she sucks.", "NTA, even CF can understand the *2 traumatized children who need extra attention* point. I'm a CF myself and many of my friends are, in a similar situation all we would do and expect is support for the children.\n\nYour friend seemed to be competing with them, and judging by your other friends' reaction, she must have spread her pov around. It is possible you previously hurt her without realizing it, it is possible you previously dismissed something. Or it is possible she's just a childish person who is good at convincing others about her view, because tbh this is what seems to be from her behavior, since the begging to come to the drinking thing", "Your friend sounds like she\u2019s obsessed with you. How in the world does one person coming late or taking a 10 min phone call, or not drinking somehow ruined her night? That\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nAnyway NTA and her uninviting you is a win in my books", "Your friend sound less mature than your nephews. She needs to grow up. NTA", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry your friend is hurt, but your life has changed. You have different priorities and responsibilities and if she can't understand that, then maybe it's best that you guys put some distance between you. \n\nI truly don't understand how you being late and missing a speech ruined her night. She should've been focused on having fun rather than what you were doing.", "NTA.  Your friend doesn't sound mature enough to get engaged. God help her future partner", "It looks like you attract the adult codependent crybabies, too.", "You don't need friends like her.", "No, you're not the asshole. I, however, would be questioning why your friend is so deeply focused on you that you stepping out of a party that involved a bunch of people all there specifically for HER ruined her entire night. That's a strange attachment she's got there.", "Who needs enemies with friends like these. NTA\n\nYou have traumatized children who rely on you, yet you made an effort to appear despite that, and politely excused yourself to deal with the issue, then returned to continue to celebrate...\n\nI think you went above and beyond. I can't imagine how full your spoons must feel right now. \n\nAll the best to you and your family! Keep your chin up, you're doing awesome.", "Don't you dare apologize\n\nNTA... but damn your \"friend\" isn't much of a friend. Trying to make your drink after you've said no? Princess much? Does she have other narc tendencies?", "There's no real reason you being a tiny bit late and not drinking should upset her this much.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm sure from the sounds of it you're an amazing person to be stepping up to parent your two boys. \n\nI was treated in a similar way at an (ex I'm afraid) friends engagement party. I had had my first kid and I was also incredibly unwell with a chronic illness. However I made a massive effort to attend the event.  Like you I made no fuss or mention about it, I just showed up but I didn't drink and I like you I stepped out to talk to my husband briefly as our baby was really upset. Like you I just politely excused myself for 5 mins.   \n\nShe treated me like crap for the rest of the event, completely shunning me and making a point not to talk to me.  She then also seemed to get pissed off that despite this I was fine because my two best friends were there.  She'd become friends with them because the three of them had been my bridesmaids. My best friends couldn't really work out why they were at the engagement party because they didn't feel close to my other friend but nonetheless they were there and so I just hung out with them since my friend wasn't talking to me.\n\nShe was absolutely horrendous to me afterwards and then I didn't turn up to the wedding (I did remain invited to it) because I was quite literally in hospital very unwell with the illness I'd been struggling with at the engagement thing.....\n\nShe's not spoken to me since and that was about 8 years ago now.  I don't feel like I've lost anything because if that's the way someone's going to treat me well they can do one!\n\nI'm sorry that this has happened to you and like... I can totally sympathise with you - it did feel shitty at the time and I'm sure that it was even more challenging for you with the situation with your nephews and the things you mentioned (not being able to leave them with sitters etc). \n\nHopefully you can smooth over this with the people that you want to remain friends with and can re-evaluate those who are treating you poorly. You deserve more", "OMG you didn\u2019t get a piece of furniture, you are now parenting 2 living human beings.

So a little extra TLC is okay. You made time to go even if you were a bit late you still showed. She should have respected you aren\u2019t drinking. I hate that people think you have to drink to have a good time at a party/event. A lot changed when you\u2019re a parent and you\u2019re an unplanned parent to twin boys at an already hard age for children.", "NTA\nYou've been uninvited. Take it as a win.\nThe friend is childish and her enjoyment of her special evening shouldn't hinge so much on you.", "Yikes.\n\nMassive NTA.\n\nSounds like wedding is causing her to lose her mind. But it's not your problem. Keep it polite so when she comes up for air she'll realise its all her fault.", "NTA. If this is the whole story then you did nothing to ruin her evening. Coming late or stepping outside for a moment is nothing uncommon at parties. \nMaybe there is something else going on, maybe she is jealous or something like that with your new family life.

Literally no one cared. Your friends just kind of a dick.", "NTA, friend, sounds incredibly entitled.  I'm not sure why the bride would center her engagement party around who was there and listened to her speech.", "WTF? NTA in any way. She wasn't getting engaged or married to you, so there's no way you not drinking or having to take a call should cause her to throw a tantrum. It sounds like you have outgrown these friends.", " \u201cit\u2019s a few hours, those kids don\u2019t have to be on your mind all the time\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nguaranteed to be one of those moms \n\nNTA", "NTA.  She chose to be hurt by your actions.  They were not inherently hurtful, and you had no intent of being hurtful.  She can take responsibility over her feelings, grow up a bit, and stop trying to make you the bad guy here.", "NTA, and your friend is the AH when drinking.", "NTA she is being entitled and inconsiderate and immature.\n\n(Unless there is something that you don\u2019t tell.)", "NTA, you made your best effort and you showed up. And yes, when kids are dealing with trauma, they do need to be priority at all times. \nYour friends reaction is really weird.", "NTA. I somehow missed that it was an engagement party. First of all, she's the one that begged you to come. You didn't miss her wedding, you were slightly late, because the kids were the priority. Then she gets mad you for being sober ? And missing a speech ? I'd understand if that was the actual wedding, but she needs to understand these kids have trauma and that they will always be your first priority", "NTA", "You don\u2019t need friends like that.\nNTA", "NTA. I really don't get this whole this is my special bride-engagement-wedding-nobody-counts-but-me nonsense. Is marriage really so bad, that people need one last special time just about them before going through with it?", "NTA\n\nWhy should you apologise for her being fixated on your movements?", "You\u2019ve already apologized so she\u2019s just being a pettybridezilla now. NTA.", "NTA. Also child free and I totally don\u2019t understand her attitude at all. Sounds like she\u2019s doing a lot of projecting (for whatever reason). Those kids are the most important thing and it sounds like you and your husband have really stepped up for them, in so very many ways.", "Social worker here.\n\nAbsolutely NTA. Your friend is selfish and doesn\u2019t grasp the reality of your situation. Which by the way, absolute kudos to you and your husband for taking in your nephews despite wanting to remain child free. I understand how you said it wasn\u2019t a hard choice at all to take them, but you are still allowed to mourn the life you wanted to have before with no kids, without feeling guilty. \n\nKids who come from traumatic situations take a long time to adjust, even with therapy/counselling. Your friend needs to understand that, and understand that as those kids\u2019 parents you and your husband have the responsibility to make them feel safe and secure at home. This might mean missing events like weddings and engagement parties. If they can\u2019t understand that, they are not really your friends.", "Raising traumatized kiddos is so hard and can be so isolating. I\u2019ve lost about half my friends since we adopted and it\u2019s honestly harder with my friends who *do* have kids because they think we\u2019re experiencing the same things. Be strong. NTA", "NTA This child-free wedding trend is getting really annoying. If people wanna ban kids from their wedding, that's their perogative but getting all butthurt and offended if people with kids can't come, leave early or whatever just shows how immature and selfish these people are. What an AH your friend is.", "NTA, but your friend is experiencing the realization that she\u2019s \u201clost\u201d her friend. You\u2019re not lost but your entire life perspective has had to shift. I think what you\u2019re doing for your nephews is selfless and admirable. But, just like friends groups that shift once people start having kids, this is pretty much the same. Your life has had to shift. Your #1 priority now is your nephews. Your friend misses the time she had with you before then, and she desperately wants it back and doesn\u2019t understand that she can\u2019t get it back. You can\u2019t just let go for a few hours, you have two very small, traumatized family members that you care about and have to have a mind for. Someday in the future, things will settle for you and you\u2019ll be able to go out completely free of obligations, but that\u2019s not right now. And yeah, these dynamics mean that friendships drift apart. You had freedom before, and now you have obligations. Your friend misses that. She enjoyed freedom friend, not obligations friend. It just happens. It sucks, and it sucks that she\u2019s framing it as meaning that you don\u2019t care about her, because it has nothing to do with it. She\u2019s just really sad that she suddenly lost her friend and doesn\u2019t know how to grieve/accept the loss.\n\nI hope y\u2019all can mend the friendship in the future when things settle out a bit. Good luck with your little boys, OP.", "I'm childfree. I'm a great auntie but have zero maternal instincts. Hold the baby? Sure, I'll even diaper or give one a bottle, but as soon as they start screaming in my ear? Here, Mama or Daddy, take your kid back, please. Run after a toddler. Uh, no. \n\nBut I absolutely cannot comprehend people who go ballistic when their friends put their children first! That is how it should be for crying out loud. And in OP's situation, suddenly the parent for traumatized 5 year old twins, that goes, well I was going to say double, but maybe quadruple is more like it. \n\nThere are some parents out there who are so uptight they won't hire a sitter. For the rest, if they won't hire a sitter, there's an actual *reason*. It could be a very long time before those kids are in a space where the mere idea of being left with someone else doesn't cause a meltdown. \n\nOP, your friends may simply not be able to handle having a lower priority in your life than before. That's sad and unfortunate, but predictable. Best of luck with the little ones, and most definitely NTA.", "NTA. Sounds like standard life for parents. \n\nI'm guessing she just wanted to have your full attention and devotion for one night like it used to be before you had kids to care for, but didn't clearly communicate that. Nor is it reasonable or fair, but nonetheless I think that may explain her upset at what are very normal things to happen at an event. \n\nMore than likely she also has some other emotions going on about the event and it's just firing in your direction. \n\nIt sounds like you were very nice and rational, and your experience in handling 2 five years olds was useful in handling her calmly and rationally and just responding with relevant feedback.", ">She told me to fuck off and said something like \u201cit\u2019s a few hours, those kids don\u2019t have to be on your mind all the time\u201d\n\nYikes!  Keep that woman FAR away from your boys.  Good Lord.\n\nThe fact that she demanded that you ONLY pay attention to her, that she spent time pressuring you to drink, that she got angry with you for COMFORTING YOUR CHILDREN is...selfish, egotistical, and ridiculous.\n\nYou didn't hurt her.  She CHOSE to get offended by your failure to dance 100% attendance on her every single second of the evening.  Normal, non-child-hating people understand that one's kids come first.\n\nPersonally, consider yourself lucky that she's shown her true colors so soon.  It sounds like she resents you for taking in your nephews...because she can no longer be the center of attention in your relationship.  I think if you really think about it, you'll realize that she's always been self-centered.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If she's really your friend then she will understand the situation. She's not your friend. She's a person that you know. Family always comes first", "She is not your friend. A friend wouldn\u2019t treat you that way.", " NTA at all. You took on a responsibility for those two kids when you took them in and you are fulfilling that responsibility. Your adult friend should not expect to be a priority over two traumatized children and, really, it seems like she was the one working herself up and looking for reasons to be upset with you. Who cares if you were drinking or not? You were on the phone for ten minutes, that\u2019s nothing. \n\nWould your friend have been as upset if those ten minutes had been for a bathroom break? Or if you weren\u2019t drinking bc you were on medication? Or if you were late bc there was traffic due to an unexpected accident?\n\nI ask bc it seems to me that your friend may be more upset just by the fact that you have new responsibilities in your life. Some people do not handle change well, especially when they see their friends changing their own lives, bc it means that their friendship dynamics may change and they can\u2019t handle that. \n\nIt also sounds like you\u2019re part of a largely childfree friend group / the first to have children and your friend doesn\u2019t know how to adjust to the changes that children bring but she can\u2019t say \u201cOP, I resent that you have kids now\u201d so instead she\u2019s expressing her upset feelings through \u201cOP ruined my engagement party!\u201d, with the underlying message of \u201cbecause she decided to have kids and kids ruin everything\u201d", "But you see, sue wasn\u2019t just late, she was late *because of the kids*. And she didn\u2019t just choose not to drink, she didn\u2019t drink just in case *because of the kids*\u2026 so obviously it makes sense to be upset because OP is choosing the kids over friends and flaunting That Parent Life in front of everyone. \n\n/sarcasm\n\nIt\u2019s weird OP, I\u2019d expect that reaction of we were of central importance to the party (you\u2019re the maid of honour, it\u2019s a joint party\u2026) otherwise I don\u2019t see why what you, one guest among many do matters. It ruined her part because she hyper fixated on everything you did instead of enjoying the party with all the guests. NTA", "I mean they're all probably feeling neglected by OP spending so much time and energy on the children but they need to get over it and accept that they have entered a different stage of friendship with OP, even if that means ending the friendship, because OP's priority is her children now, as it should be.", "Though I really hope the kids are in therapy working towards the point where the OP and her husband can leave without tears and distress.", "After she begged you to come\u2026 you tried to NOT be there to interfere with the night but she pressured you so they can kick rocks\n\nETA:  NTA", "Yes to this . NTA. And I am so curious as to how you hold so much power (in the eyes of the bride to be) that you can make or break an entire event by not drinking or discreetly stepping out to make a call?
