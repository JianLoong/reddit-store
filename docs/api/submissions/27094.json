People are asking him to have an amicable relationship with an ex-wife whom he divorced around 8 years ago after she was caught cheating on him.

We also don't know OP's financial situation, not to mention he has clearly stated that he does not want to be around his ex-wife. While his daughter is upset, she is a child and needs to learn the importance of communication, especially when discussing the use of other people's money and planning big events. This may be a significant cultural milestone, but it doesn't change the fact that her mother raised her hopes for a location without communicating and agreeing to it beforehand with OP. Any fallout falls on the mother in this case unless she wishes to cover the cost singlehandedly and have a separate party as OP suggested. OP is already planning out a party for his daughter with the help of his wife and is meeting his daughter's needs (maybe not all her wants though that is life).  \n\n\nEdit: I noticed that OP even attempted to organize it with his ex-wife and she refused to coordinate it initially because of her [petty shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16llgzp/comment/k133js2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

The mom who only put in 5% bc the rest of her family helped her pay. In the end, the dad and his family were treated like outsiders at the party even though they were the main ones who contributed. \n\nPersonal opinion: 15's are bullshit and a waste of money.

Why must OP have to be around his ex-wife and that side of the family when they can have completely separate parties for their daughter? \n\nWhile I think asking the daughter what she wants is fine in and of itself, if the daughter wants a party where everyone and her family is there, I find it strange that the OP not liking that idea makes him the AH and he should just do it \u201cfor his daughter\u201d.

He doesn\u2019t want to be around his ex-wife that broke his trust and cheated on him, ruining their marriage. Divorce is a traumatic experience for everyone involved. Making OP relive that is extremely unfair. Besides, it seems the only relationship he has to his ex-wife now is on rare occasions to discuss certain affairs with his kids on short notice, rather than both of them making a cohesive plan on how they want their daughter\u2019s future to be.

Both ass for that.\n\nIt seems daughter approached her mom on her own. Should she let her dad know as well? Yeah probably.

That's it.\n\nAs mentioned, I believe OP wouldn't have been very hands on in planning, since the party he is throwing is actually organized by his wife, not him. I swear, men look at a venue and THINK they are organizing something and let their wives to plan the ACTUAL event, from guest lists to napkins. Men don't even register napkins. They would go without or use whatever. If OP is the exception here, he should tell us.\n\nAnd again, if the cost of the party as planned by his ex was the issue, it could have easily been resolved with an adult conversation about costs and setting up a budget.

So only one of them excluded the other one completely and didn't talk to their daughter about it.", "Yep, depends on phrasing but it sounds like she *found* a venue she liked, and was running the idea by OP. That was his chance to say no it's too much money, or hey I want to help plan, or even \"What does daughter think?\"  \n\nAnd I think a lot of redditors are judging the word \"venue,\" thinking it implies something too fancy.

You literally stated the father was wrong for doing the exact same thing the mom was but the moms came with a price tag to boot. \n\nAgain they\u2019re both crap at coexisting as ex spouses but unfortunately, it happens often.

But for how important this upcoming party is, I would 100% say that she can, and should, make it clear on how she wants it. The party is for her, and it\u2019s celebrating a major milestone in her life, she should be expected to voice her opinions. \n\nShe\u2019s a kid in the sense that the law states that she needs parental consent for major decisions.

And I can\u2019t help but think there\u2019s a financial aspect to it, as his main \u201cunfair\u201d comment was regarding venue choice (where large portion of the budget, can go towards.) \n\nShould he had expected a quin? Yes, but from the post it seems like both daughter and ex knew he was planning one for her too. Now he hasn\u2019t responded on if it was prior to their announcement, but if it was then yeah, he\u2019s 109% right to say it\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d to be blindsided like this.", "There are two options realistically here. \n\n1. He is expecting Mom to throw a lavish party while he gets cake and paper plates and invites a couple immediate family members. If it\u2019s this, he\u2019s an asshole. This is a Quincea\u00f1era, not some random birthday party.\n\n2. He is planning to throw a huge party, but is not including his daughter to see what she would like, is not inviting her mother to her Quincea\u00f1era, is expecting his ex wife to ALSO throw a second huge party, and is expecting it to not be deeply weird and embarrassing for his daughter to have to invite all of her friends to two separate Quincea\u00f1era\u2019s because mom and dad can\u2019t get along for five minutes to have one party. If it\u2019s this, he\u2019s an asshole.\n\nI\u2019m not really seeing based on his story how it can\u2019t be one of those two things. \n\nEx wife should have included him earlier in the process, agreed, and obviously her cheating on him in the first place makes her an asshole. But in either scenario he strikes me as a clear asshole here. And after 8 years, with 4 kids together, if you\u2019re at the point of having to throw two separate Quincea\u00f1era\u2019s because you can\u2019t be in the same room as the ex wife, it\u2019s time to go talk to a therapist and get over it for your kids sake. As someone said, are you going to not attend your kids weddings or throw separate receptions? You absolutely never have to forgive someone who cheated on you but if you\u2019re not making an effort to co exist for the sake of the kids, shame on you.\n\nAnd again, it\u2019s a Quincea\u00f1era. Maybe he does throw his own birthday party for her every year. This is a bigger deal than a random birthday party, and even if he was planning on going bigger, you have to invite the mother. Having two separate big parties is ridiculous.", "For their Quincea\u00f1era? We typically do separate parties as well for my godchildren for the same reason, but a Quincea\u00f1era is not the same thing as a regular random birthday party.", "Except, that doesn\u2019t  make sense because he WAS planning a party to celebrate it.

It looks like OP is bitter that his ex married someone with money, and regardless of his new relationship, he\u2019s still very angry with his ex for the infidelity.   After 8 years, it sounds like OP needs some counselling to be able to move on and be able to parent his children effectively.\n\nAs for the party, from what I understand, a quinceanera is on par with a bar mitzvah or nearly a wedding, as far as large parties go.  It\u2019s ridiculous to have two, and it should be treated by the parents like a wedding, where you each bring your own partner, smile and suck it up for your daughter.\n\nThe ex wife is also an AH for choosing a venue without consulting the OP and just expecting him to help finance an event that might be beyond his financial resources.  They need to have a joint party that they are both able to afford, with input from both parents and the daughter.", "I don\u2019t believe for one second that you don\u2019t KNOW how significant a Quincea\u00f1era is to a girl.

Unless they have a history of doing things together, it would not make much sense that the mother would assume the father was going to celebrate together. She chose a venue without consulting him and then told, not asked, the father to put money in. This scenario and his choice of words also resonate with me because my ex does similar things.

She could easily arrange her schedule to be home to take care of the kids. She chooses not to.  She lives with her parents in a very nice house but my kids have told me repeatedly that there isn\u2019t anything to do, they are not allowed to sit on certain couches, not allowed in certain rooms, they are bored over there, etc.  Their house is a beautiful house, but a house, not a home. If you walked into their house, you wouldn\u2019t know kids lived there. My place is much more modest.  It\u2019s very obvious that I have multiple kids.  I have lots of art supplies, games, toys, etc. I take my kids swimming two to three times a week unless it\u2019s super cold. I also have a nanny for kids when I\u2019m working.  My kids think of her as a mother and she keeps them busy with activities.  Rarely do my kids sit around watching tv for extended periods at my house. I know they do at their moms because they don\u2019t have much to do by their own words. Every year my ex signs them up for some ridiculously expensive summer day program expecting me to pay for it. Or how about telling my kids that she is going to Hawaii but during the time when they are with me so they feel they are missing out.
