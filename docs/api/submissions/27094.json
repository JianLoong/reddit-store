People are asking him to have an amicable relationship with an ex-wife whom he divorced around 8 years ago after she was caught cheating on him.

We also don't know OP's financial situation, not to mention he has clearly stated that he does not want to be around his ex-wife. While his daughter is upset, she is a child and needs to learn the importance of communication, especially when discussing the use of other people's money and planning big events. This may be a significant cultural milestone, but it doesn't change the fact that her mother raised her hopes for a location without communicating and agreeing to it beforehand with OP. Any fallout falls on the mother in this case unless she wishes to cover the cost singlehandedly and have a separate party as OP suggested. OP is already planning out a party for his daughter with the help of his wife and is meeting his daughter's needs (maybe not all her wants though that is life).  \n\n\nEdit: I noticed that OP even attempted to organize it with his ex-wife and she refused to coordinate it initially because of her [petty shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16llgzp/comment/k133js2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

The mom who only put in 5% bc the rest of her family helped her pay. In the end, the dad and his family were treated like outsiders at the party even though they were the main ones who contributed. \n\nPersonal opinion: 15's are bullshit and a waste of money.

I make sure they go to school with shoes that are in good condition and clean. She sends them back with shoes that look like they are homeless.

Tell her that in the future you will always be prepared to have a party for her with you guys but that you will not be contributing to anything her mother arranged in the future.
