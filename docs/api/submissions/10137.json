{"id": 10137, "submission_id": "11416q2", "title": "AITA for not buying takeout for my unemployed girlfriend?", "selftext": "My girlfriend and I moved across the country to a big city at the end of January. Her job wouldn\u2019t let her stay if she relocated so I told her that it was okay to quit and I would take care of both of us while she looked for a new job (something I\u2019ve already done for us in the past).\n\nI make six figures. The thing is, six figures is only slightly over the living wage in the city we moved to. We can live comfortably but won\u2019t be able to eat fancy dinners or take frequent trips like we want to until she gets a job. My girlfriend has been applying for jobs since before we moved but hasn\u2019t gotten past the second round of interviews for any place she\u2019s applied for.\n\nHere\u2019s the issue: I can afford to get takeout for myself, but I can\u2019t afford to get it for both me *and* my girlfriend and be able to put money away at the end of the month. I buy our groceries so we have some food at home for her to cook, but the neighborhood we live in is known for its restaurants, so of course I want to have some every now and then. Whenever she sees a takeout box in the kitchen she gets really sad that I didn\u2019t offer to get her anything. I tell her she can buy her own but she has about $2500 in savings and doesn\u2019t want to spend any of it.\n\nThis morning I got myself a pastry and some coffee from a caf\u00e9 nearby. She got really sad and said she wanted some too, and when I told her to go and get some, she said she couldn\u2019t afford it. I told her I couldn\u2019t afford to get it for her either. She then suggested that we both eat at home for breakfast and lunch more - she cooks dinner for us every night anyway - so that there will be more money for us both to get takeout, just less frequently. I told her that wasn\u2019t fair to me. She didn\u2019t say anything and looked really sad. I finally sighed and said \u201cfine, I\u2019ll get you something.\u201d She refused.\n\nI moved here because I wanted to experience a big city and its culture, and if I\u2019m stifled by her lack of income, I feel like I would be robbing myself of that experience. It isn\u2019t my fault that she\u2019s having trouble finding a job. I shouldn\u2019t have to also deal with the struggles of that. I support her in every other aspect and I don\u2019t ask her to contribute to bills or groceries. I just want to be able to enjoy the occasional luxury of takeout in a brand new city. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I need to address this. It was not my sole decision to move. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve both wanted for awhile. We also made the joint decision to move to our current city. I didn\u2019t \u201cconvince\u201d her to move with me or quit her job. I told her it would be okay to. If she had any reservations about it she could have stayed back and continued to work but she wanted to move here just as much as I did.", "created_utc": 1676581812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11416q2/aita_for_not_buying_takeout_for_my_unemployed/", "score": 719, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YOU want to experience the local culture while she goes without? Five zillion times; **YTA!** You clearly do not love her, so it was unfair to uproot her to move to a new city.

You're clearly not able to empathize with her situation and really, you couldn't even get that poor woman a Danish? No, you convinced her to uproot her whole life for you because you said you'd take care of her. She believed you.

She's looking for work! In fact, she's getting second interviews, so it's only a matter of time before she finds something. This is entirely temporary.\n\nSuck it up for a bit, the luxuries will come.\n\nUnless you want to grow resentment, that's real healthy for a relationship.

You're supposed to be partners, and sometimes that means, if you can't afford takeout for both of you, you both go without and eat what's in the fridge. \n\nI cannot believe I just had to type out that sentence to an adult, so I really hope this is a troll post.\n\nYTA", "You guys live together?

She gave reasonable options to help both of you be happy, but it's all about you. Maybe you need to find a better job.

Times when we've been low on groceries and I didn't have time/energy to stop after work (2 jobs/day 5 days/week, think 9-5 and 5-9, 3 total, often not home until 10) and wanted to order take out or delivery...I texted him from work and asked what we wanted from different places and picked up for both of us. Are we still ordering appetizers and multiple entrees? No, we are BOTH cutting down on order size due to budget. But here's the biggest difference between me and you, I suspect: I love him. I'd never once, let alone regularly, only order take out for me and not him. More often I've wanted it, not been able to afford 2 portions, and went home for elaborate ramen or hot dogs and beans and whatever instead of only taking care of myself. I couldnt fathom it.

Her job wouldn\u2019t let her stay if she relocated so I told her that it was okay to quit and I would take care of both of us while she looked for a new job (something I\u2019ve already done for us in the past).\n\nI make six figures. The thing is, six figures is only slightly over the living wage in the city we moved to. We can live comfortably but won\u2019t be able to eat fancy dinners or take frequent trips like we want to until she gets a job. My girlfriend has been applying for jobs since before we moved but hasn\u2019t gotten past the second round of interviews for any place she\u2019s applied for.\n\nHere\u2019s the issue: I can afford to get takeout for myself, but I can\u2019t afford to get it for both me *and* my girlfriend and be able to put money away at the end of the month. I buy our groceries so we have some food at home for her to cook, but the neighborhood we live in is known for its restaurants, so of course I want to have some every now and then. Whenever she sees a takeout box in the kitchen she gets really sad that I didn\u2019t offer to get her anything. I tell her she can buy her own but she has about $2500 in savings and doesn\u2019t want to spend any of it.\n\nThis morning I got myself a pastry and some coffee from a caf\u00e9 nearby. She got really sad and said she wanted some too, and when I told her to go and get some, she said she couldn\u2019t afford it. I told her I couldn\u2019t afford to get it for her either. She then suggested that we both eat at home for breakfast and lunch more - she cooks dinner for us every night anyway - so that there will be more money for us both to get takeout, just less frequently. I told her that wasn\u2019t fair to me. She didn\u2019t say anything and looked really sad. I finally sighed and said \u201cfine, I\u2019ll get you something.\u201d She refused.\n\nI moved here because I wanted to experience a big city and its culture, and if I\u2019m stifled by her lack of income, I feel like I would be robbing myself of that experience. It isn\u2019t my fault that she\u2019s having trouble finding a job. I shouldn\u2019t have to also deal with the struggles of that. I support her in every other aspect and I don\u2019t ask her to contribute to bills or groceries. I just want to be able to enjoy the occasional luxury of takeout in a brand new city.

I had to take a temporary leave (about a month) from my job, we had savings, and she told me before I took the leave that it would be completely fine to cover it from the savings. 2 weeks in she wouldn't let me eat anymore because I was stealing from HER savings (that I had been contributing equally to for years).
