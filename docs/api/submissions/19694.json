I know we\u2019re both adults and can do whatever we want but we don\u2019t want to lose their respect so my boyfriend said he would talk to my dad and ask him for my hand in marriage and also talk to him about us moving in together once we\u2019re engaged and closer to our wedding date. We had a family BBQ yesterday with both my boyfriend\u2019s parents and my parents and my boyfriend said he would talk to my dad then. He didn\u2019t. I asked him afterwards why he didn\u2019t talk to him (he had lots of opportunities) and he basically said he\u2019ll ask him another time and that he\u2019s not in a rush and told me to be patient. \n\nIt\u2019s confusing because he\u2019s the one who brought it up and told me he was going to talk to him so we can figure out out living situation. I asked him if he was having second thoughts or is getting scared but all he says is \u201csoon, be patient\u201d.

Him simply answering your concerns with \"soon\" and no explanatioon is a huge red flag.

Do not buy a house with him.  \n\nNever be dependent on someone else for your living situation.  Sell the house, buy or rent a new one, do not put him on the paperwork of your new place.

And it sounds like \"soon\" has turned out to be \"never.\"\n\nWhy would you be an AH if you're not \"including him\" in buying a house? He's not including you in his life. He's too busy keeping you at a distance. Like the key issue; so what if his mother has a spare key? He takes his own key to a key cutting place and has one made. He hasn't done it because he doesn't want to do it.\n\nBuy your house.

If you can afford it on your own, it doesn't hurt your potential future together.   Don't see how he could be mad about you building equity before he is paying anything into it.\n\nThe key thing is a red flag, though.  This takes a couple of bucks and a couple minutes at any hardware store.", "YWNBTA, but you need to have a serious talk with him about what your expectations are for the future. If you allow him to keep making false promises to you, he's just going to keep doing it. \n\nHe needs to be honest with you about what he actually wants.

You would be extremely unwise if you bought a house with this man in this current situation and even unwiser if you paid for the house alone but put him in the deed. Don't do that. Seriously. Don't. \n\nI'm sorry to say that it sounds like your boyfriend is stringing you along. He brings up what he knows you want (proposal of marriage, living together, etc.) precisely so his word on it will have more weight (\"I didn't ask, he was the one who mentioned it, so it must mean he wants it\"). But he's just dangling the apple before you without any true intention to let you have it.\n\nThink about it: He wants to marry you... but he won't even trust you with a key to his place. That man is far from ready to commit. \n\nYou can try to lay it out for him that while he might \"not be in any rush\", you are ready to take the next step and you have no more \"patience\" because you want to start living the next chapter of your life and not waste any more time dragging the current one. You have goals and projects to fulfill, and you're unhappy with the way things are. \n\nBut my best guess is he won't react positively to that. So you need to prepare yourself for a breakup... or to be in this \"soon\" stage for the foreseeable future.", "NTA.  It is a TERRIBLE idea to rush into marriage just to appease your judgmental parents, though.  You need to stand up to them and make your own choices.  That's part of being an adult.", "NTA this is giving me some red flags that he\u2019s waiting so long and pushing it off. He could just be nervous but ehh. You\u2019re allowed to do what you want with your life; if he doesn\u2019t want to commit then that\u2019s on him, but you shouldn\u2019t put your plans on hold because he\u2019s indefinitely on hold himself.", "buy yourself a house!

This guy is stringing you along. Break up with him already!", "I think one of the main issues here is that you are rushing things because of your family's  ''respect'' over traditions. You need to understand that the only ones that are in this relationship are you and your boyfriend. and that you are always going to make something that will upset their traditional believes at some point or another in your life and relationships. So I think that you and your boyfriend need to come to terms with that idea and live your lifes at your own pace. \n\nBecause it seems to me that you both need more time to figure things out before the big commitement that living toghether and marriage is.", "NTA, I hate ultimatums but like.... if he isnt giving you an answer you need to tell him you are moving on. You deserve to know whats going on. Theres an idea of the perfect engagement, but it isnt happening because all thats happen is your feelings are being hurt. If he says soon again, then you counter with never. Save yourself an eternal lie of soon. And the idea he wont give you a key is stupid because you literally can go to any walmart and have one made. If he isnt cheating I would eat my shoe.", "NTA. you can't put your life on hold for someone who is not decisive. I think he is just appeasing you with all of the looking at rings, houses but he is not taking any actions. The spare key is really stupid his mom does not need a key it gives the feeling that someone else has the key not really his mom. There is something that my husband always says because we got married really fast and I was always scared we were rushing into it and he told me that when a guy really wants something he makes it happen no excuses at all. Start looking for the best living situation for yourself living in a crappy place is not good for your mental health, take care of yourself.", "NTA. But cut your losses.

Instead I'll say just leave him because of he's not certain what he wants in life and is dragging you along because of his uncertainty, it is not going to workout in long term. He is aware of your situation and still refuses to help you out from it, that shows how selfish he is.

If he's vague, keep pushing. \n\nIt honestly sounds like he's stringing you along bc he has no intention of marrying you but doesn't want to lose you. He can make a copy of his key. He doesn't need a spare back. \n\nAlso, don't use marriage or cohabitation as a means to escape. It won't work. Buy your own home. \n\nOh!

However, he had in a senses a roving eye. Never cheated in a physical sense.  He rarely had his girlfriend attend things with his friends. We all sensed he was just keeping an eye out for something better. Think it didn't help that his parents weren't a big fan of her either. Took 16 years to finally propose. She said yes and had everything booked in within a month. He was so shocked. You could see he wasn't expecting it so quickly organised. Like dude, what were you expecting? She's been with you so long that she would already know what she wanted. What do you think you will still be engaged for another 16 years. It was a sham of a wedding, too. He wanted to cancel it, but she gave him an ultimatum, she would leave (he said they spent a lot and she had family from overseas coming). That was 8 years ago.

She should buy a house, get rid of him and find someone that actually wants a future with her.", "On an actual read, my answer is still NTA. As someone who was in a similar relationship for... too long I only recently got out of, he's got you hovering in limbo; not able to move elsewhere, all thanks to a vague, ever moving promise of 'soon'. He's comfortable with how things are, and I have a feeling thanks to that things are NOT gonna change.", "Yeah man, my boyfriend gave me the key to his house within the first three months, because it was just easier this way, it was a no brainer.
