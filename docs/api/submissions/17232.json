My wife is currently pregnant and we have a 3-year-old daughter together. For the most part, our relationship has been fine except for one disagreement. I have a teddy bear stuffed animal and a blanket from when I was a baby. My mother made the blanket by hand and she had gotten the teddy bear for me on my 6th birthday. I loved these items but became attached to them when my mother passed away when I was 12. When I hugged my bear and blanket I felt like I was hugging her. These items were very important to me. Even though my wife knew how important they were to me she still hated the idea of me having them.\n\nThese items were never on the bed. My bear was on a chair in our bedroom and my blanket was in the closet. As I got older just looking at them made me okay and it felt like my mother was watching me and telling me life would be okay. Anyways, while I was working odd jobs yesterday my wife informed me she was going to donate the stuff that we gathered the day before. Turns out without my knowledge she decided to put my blanket and bear into the donation bags and I was pissed. She argued that these items could bring another kid happiness which resulted in a bigger argument. I ended up going to my father's house and canceled everything I planned for Mother's Day without telling her. Since I didn't tell her she was under the impression we were still going out so a few hours ago she called me asking when I was gonna come home and I firmly told her it was best if she spent Mother's Day at her mom's house. I offered to come get our daughter but she wanted her to stay so I hung up. I've been getting messages from her parents calling me childish and I should just get over it but I can't because she knew how important those items were to me. Reddit AITA?\n\nEdit: I wanted to add this. I don't bring the bear and blanket with me everywhere anymore that stopped almost a decade ago.

Obviously toxic move aside, no, decades-old plushies are not a great thing to donate. Also why does she want to make a big deal out of mother's day, but not spend it with her mother or her children, but with you?", "NTA and your wife is heartless", "NTA. That is horrible. She\u2019s so cruel. And expect you to celebrate her as a mother when she threw away something your own mother gave you?", "Nta. Your wife, wow man, to be offended by a stuffed animal and a blanket.  I would be so pissed if someone gave away sentimental items! You needed to cool off and for her to act like it wasn't a big deal... actions have consequences.", "NTA: Your wife disrespected you. You said your wife understands what your items mean to you, but still doesn't like the idea of you having them. She doesn't have to like it, but she has to respect it. Instead, she flat-out tried to get rid of the stuff that your late mom got you, and all because she didn't want you to have a teddy bear and a blanket.

If you go in and tell them that sentimental items were stolen then donated they will help you locate them. \n\nNTA. She should probably become familiar with doing mothers day alone.", "Nta. I think you need to consider if you want to stay in this marriage, or go to therapy and ask her why she has such and issue with the bear and blanket.", "NTA she didn't tell you that she was donating your sentimental items because she knew you'd disagree with her. Why wouldn't she keep them for you to share with your children? This was a calculated attempt to hurt you with no justification whatsoever.  Don't go back until she returns what she stole.", "NTA. She does not respect you and sounds abusive. You should to reevaluate your relationship with her.", "Massive, massive NTA!!! How dare she throw those things away! Your mother died, these were things that made you feel close to her in moments where you probably could have used a motherly hug! It doesn\u2019t matter how old you are, it doesn\u2019t matter what your wife\u2019s opinions are around these items, they were your belongings and she stole them and gave them away! I\u2019m sorry but your wife is heartless, I hope she remembers this when she has to go through the heartache of losing her mother. Also I really hope you can track the bear and blanket down to get them back! I kind of feel a little heartbroken for you and I\u2019m flabbergasted somebody would do this to their own husband.", "What is wrong with her?!  What an immature, despicable thing to do!

They took his skunk away and with no parents able to visit or that skunk to hold it affected him a lot. I'd never think of stealing his emotional-support stuffy. \n\nMy guess? She's embarrassed that a grown adult loves what she considers toys. It's entirely possible she did this to shame what she considers a childish need. She's wrong. \n\nJust so you'll know, 5-star resorts and motels alike have rules concerning stuffy friend's. They're treated ask valued possessions of the guest and given an honored place against the pillows. No staff would think of not shipping back a treasured possession to a departed guest and she just donated yours.", "NTA. Honestly I'd tell her she either gets the items back or you'll be spending every day for the rest of your life away from her because you won't stay married to a monster who would do what she did.", "NTA\n\nI'm pissed for you that she got rid of them.", "NTA - she threw out your only reminders of your dead mother. Now she wants you to take her out for Mother\u2019s Day. Oh the irony\u2026", "People are very quick to to talk about toxic masculinity, but stories like this where women cannot stand to have anyone other woman be part of their partners lives are examples of toxic femininity. This also applies to mothers who cannot accept their sons wives", "NTA. What is wrong with some people in this thread??? Are you seriously comparing donating the only 2 physical things that he has left from his mom with not telling his wife the dinner celebration is not happening??? And saying he was childish for not letting her know? If my partner and I had a heated argument and they left to their parents\u2019 house (which he admits he only does when he is really mad) I would immediately assume that the celebration is off. This just shows how entitled and selfish she is and that she only cares about herself. \n\nI bet the replies would be completely different if the gender roles were reversed and the husband was the one throwing away the wife\u2019s things. The double standard is appalling. \n\nSeriously Op if this was my partner I would seriously reconsider this relationship. She has no regards for your feelings or things and I bet she would be furious if you donated something of hers without her knowledge. I could never forgive my partner for this. You deserve so much better than her.", "NTA and this would be a deal breaker for me. If my partner broke my trust like this they could never gain it back.", "**NTA** So she decided to give away something that holds great value without consulting you. If my wife gave away something that I owned without consulting me and didn't hold great value I'd still be pissed.", "NTA even if you didn\u2019t have the attachment. I would personally would have wanted your daughter to have it. \n\nIt would have been something special from the grandma she never meet.\n\nWhat your wife did was petty and cruel. It\u2019s almost like she is jealous of a memory.", "please tell me you managed to get these items back \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGet a divorce. That AH KNOWINGLY BETRAYED and HURT you.", "She\u2019s that bothered by a sentimental gift given to you by your mom\u2026yikes", "NTA I really hate your wife she is a big AH, please try to get your items back. You might be able. Tell them they are mementos of your mom and your wife mistakenly donate them. I think you might be able to get them back if you act fast", "ESH you 2 shouldn\u2019t be together and I feel bad for the kids.  Wife was TA for throwing your things away.  You\u2019re TA for cancelling mothers days.  The kids see the way you are both shitting together and will think this is how to treat people they love.", "ESH. What your wife did was awful, absolutely awful. Instead of addressing it like an adult, you plotted against her and did something to get back at her which is incredibly immature and is in no way helpful. \n\nIf you are so upset that you don\u2019t want to be around her on Mother\u2019s Day, you need to tell her that and then take the time you need. When there is a problem, you two need to work together to fix it, not do underhanded shit to each other.\n\nSet a good example of how to handle problems to your daughter.", "ESH and this is bigger than an argument over a Goodwill donation.\n\nYep, it's pretty heartless of her to take meaningful items from your childhood and donate them without a discussion. \n\nThat said, you're the one who should make that call, but I'm curious whether there's something bigger going on. Is your wife frustrated with you not dealing with things that happened in the past in a constructive way? Have you seen a therapist - with or without her?\n\nEither way, I think what she did warrants a discussion, but it sounds like she's otherwise a great mom and wife - and refusing to spend mother's day with her seems immature and doesn't actually solve anything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I say take it (don't actually do anything to it, just hide it) and tell her you donated it to Goodwill.
