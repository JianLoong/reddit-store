She gave me a weird look.\n\nSD: What are you doing here.\n\nMe: I work here\n\nShe then went to talk to my boss.

Her rights end where someone with a life threatening situation begins. She could have killed a child.", "NTA. Dunno where you live, but where I am the accommodation required for someone's service animal is not absolute - it's to the point of undue hardship. That is, they have the legal right to reasonable accommodation (so you couldn't refuse entry to someone with a service dog just because you didn't like dogs), but if accommodating the service dog puts someone else in danger, then that is certainly \"undue hardship\" and you are not legally required to accommodate at that point.\n\nA kid with an allergy severe enough that she will go into anaphylactic shock after 5 minutes is a good reason for the woman with the service dog to be asked to wait outside. You weren't denying her service, anyway, you were simply asking that she wait somewhere else and explained why.  She's TA for insisting despite the kid with allergies.", "NTA, you had more common sense than the adult.

People who think they're entitled. That's not on you. Had you done something wrong, your boss would have said something.", "NTA But the daycare needs to meet this mom outside and talk to her out there about her son's behavior. This dog should not be allowed inside the building because of A's severe allergies. If that needs to be the policy for all parents to make it \"fair\" then that's what it needs to be.
