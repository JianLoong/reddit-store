My BIL (husband's brother) and SIL visited one night and left after we went to bed. They then sent a text that \"we\" were pulling out and \"we\" hit your car and \"we\" will pay. My car has a pretty bad scrape on the side. \n\nThe thing is that I know my SIL was drinking and I get the feeling she had been driving. But when I'm trying to figure out what happened it's always \"we\". So I keep trying to find ways to ask without straight up saying it, and eventually I say \"who was driving?\" and I get the response \"why?\". Like they are purposely hiding it. \n\nHere's the thing, my SIL and I don't get along at all. We're as polar opposites as anyone can be. I'm a hard worker, she's a self professed lay-about. My BIL makes all the money in their house and she spends it all while doing absolutely nothing. And she has money coming in from her parents as well. \n\nThe reason I want to know is because I think it's important that if she was driving it should be her personal money that pays for it not my BIL's. I don't think she's ever had to face the consequences of her own actions before. I also know she was drinking and think that if this was a drunk driving incident we should know. She could really harm someone with that behavior. \n\nMy husband and I got onto a fight about it now because he says why does it matter? He doesn't understand why I think it's important. Even when I said we should make an official report and go through insurance he said he doesn't want HER to get in trouble not them so he knows the truth too. Now we're fighting about it. \n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1695452695, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16pxmzx/aita_for_demanding_to_know_who_was_driving_when/", "score": 293, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When everyone labeled her an AH for her unnecessary overstepping behavior, she brought her kid to save her face. Now, bringing her kid makes her behavior even meaner. Her action now seems like full of jealousy and ungratefulness. It is a complete loose loose situation for her \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "YTA for what seems to be your motivation behind this. \n\nYes, a possible DUI is terribly dangerous, and if it was in fact your SIL driving, then she's an AH. So is your BIL *because he let her*. I don't care what others think about this point, if you are sober and let somebody drive who you know has been drinking, that's at the very least partially on you (special circumstances notwithstanding - I'm sure there are situations where the passenger has no choice). So the two of them saying \"we\" is correct in this regard. \n\nHowever, that doesn't seem to be your focus. Maybe it's just how you phrased your post, but it seems like you are quite envious of your SIL's \"easy life\". It always feels off when adults try to teach other adults a lesson, it comes across more like them wanting to take the other person down a notch. That's the vibe I'm getting - the actions you are pondering are not meant to make the situation any better, but to bring SIL down. \n\nFrom what I understand, there is no trouble with having the car repaired, they are going to pay for it. Your wish for her to pay for the repairs with her own money baffles me a bit. How do you intend to control that? They are a married couple, even if she sends the money from her own account, you have no way of checking whether he reimburses her. Do you want to see their bank statements from now until death? And there are a myriad of other ways he could get the money back to her on a day-to-day basis. It's just not feasible. \n\nIf her drinking is problematic enough to warrant an intervention, then by all means, go for it, but again, I get the impression you dislike her so much, you don't want to make things better. You want her to suffer out of envy. Wipe that smile off her face. It's not fair that her life is so easy while you have to work so hard. But this sort of envy doesn't dissipate when you put the other person down. It may feel good for the moment, but the root of it is dissatisfaction with your own life. There will always be people that have it better/easier, and every time that envy will raise its ugly head, unless you change your own situation.\n\nYour husband probably understands your intentions, maybe even better than you do, which is why he feels the need to protect SIL.", "\n>The reason I want to know is because I think it's important that if she was driving it should be her personal money that pays for it not my BIL's. I don't think she's ever had to face the consequences of her own actions before. \n\nThis fender bender is not going to be her canon event, and your reasoning is ridiculous. You just don\u2019t like her.\n\nYTA", "I get you upset and frustration but honestly, as long as the bill is getting paid, you shouldn't care who's pocket it comes from \n\nThey are a couple and they decide how there money is spent. You can be upset about her lifestyle choices but ultimately, she ain't your spouse and if bil is ok with it, then it's none of your business. \n\nAlso, if she was driving, then she's an AH for DUI. That's the only part you should be concerning yourself with, nothing else", "You are not your SIL's parent and you have no place in their relationship. You have no standing to demand anything or decree where any money should come from. No one cares that you think you're better than your SIL and are gnawing at the bit over your chance to prove it with this incident and hold it over her head for the rest of the time you know eachother. Grow up. YTA", "YTA\n\nYou don't like your SIL, that's fine. Stop making this about \"responsibility\" because you KNOW that's not the reason you're hell bent on making her pay for it. \n\nIf it really matters that much to you, call the cops and file a report. When you do, get ready for the shit storm you're going to be in the middle of just because you want to teach your SIL a lesson about personal responsibility.\n\nOh...if you DO call the cops?? She will NOT be charged with DUI because you cannot prove she was over the legal limit without a breathalyzer or blood sample taken at the time of the accident. All you'll be doing is making a police report about an accident. You can't even tell them who was driving because NO ONE other than her husband saw the accident and he will say he was driving. Good luck disproving that.", "YTA.\n\nStop trying to parent an adult. You're not going to teach anybody anything. Get your money and move on.", "YTA\n\n>I think it's important that if she was driving it should be her personal money that pays for it not my BIL's\n\nThat is absolutely not your business or decision to make. You don't get to control what happens in someone else's marriage.", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to dictate how a couple spends their money. Where their money is coming from is also irrelevant so long as it\u2019s not coming from something illegal. \n\nIt\u2019s a weird hill to die on. \n\nIf you want to file the issue through insurance, then that\u2019s your choice but I would reflect on how that would mean damaging your relationship with your in laws and potentially your husband. \n\nIf you\u2019re worried about drunk driving, address that separately in person with both of them. And not to prove a point or to make anyone feel bad but to make sure no one is being endangered on the road by someone else\u2019s reckless behavior.", "YTA. \n\nAlso if you prove she was driving and she was intoxicated. In Australia insurance will get voided. So basically it would end up making things worse for everyone not just her. \n\nGet your car fixed and move on", "WTF?! YTA. I believe you were trying to found out to know who to fill out a small court or case or something. But just because you wanna make sure who\u2019s fun money is using is dumb", "Soo.. you going to demand access to their finances to track whether BIL repays her once you unreasonably ask her to personally pay (rather than our if their family finances)?\n\nYou also **don't know** that she was drunk, you are making assumptions probably base on your bad relationship. \n\nYTA.", "YTA, you\u2019re gonna get paid, none of your business who\u2019s account it\u2019s from, you sound jealous of sil too", "YTA. \n\nGiven your cavalier attitude about her drinking and driving and watching your daughter, I\u2019m gonna guess she wasn\u2019t drinking much and you\u2019re just leaning on that as an excuse. What, did she have one glass of wine with dinner? \n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry, she\u2019s a lazy lay about but she\u2019s your childcare? She\u2019s clearly not doing nothing. \n\nAnd lastly - they are a married couple and have decided to incur this expense jointly. You can\u2019t decide for them.", "YTA. There is no good reason for your fixation on her, other than your general dislike and jealousy of her. You say you want to hold her accountable and think she is so irresponsible, yet, somehow you\u2019re still okay with her watching your kid. \n\nGet your car fixed. Worry about yourself.", "YTA Get over yourself as long they pay the damages etc who cares.   \n\nDo you think your opinion or punishment really matters, I know you want stick it to your Sil but this just makes you look bitter and unstable.   \n\nLet it Go.", "YTA.   \nShe\u2019s not a child and you are not her parent.   \nGet quotes to repair from your preferred repairer\u2026 And tell them (either/both) to pony up within 7 days or you are reporting it to your insurance.

If her husband and parents don\u2019t care about supporting her lifestyle, why do you have an opinion about it at all?\n\nEdit: If you have concerns about her drinking and driving, then she shouldn\u2019t be babysitting your child in the first place. Why would you need an admission of fender bender to make that decision?", "YTA. Your brother in law is also not blameless if he knew she had been drinking and let her drive. Get your money and stop making this a personal vendetta.", "YTA. You are not in charge of punishing another adult.\n\nYour husband is right, it doesn't really matter who was driving, because they have offering to pay for the repairs. Plus, it sounds like you really already KNOW it was SIL and that's why they don't want to tell you.\n\nIt's petty, controlling, and AH-ish that you want to dictate which of their personal accounts the repair money comes from.\n\nThat said, maybe your husband can chat with his brother about the dangers of drunk driving before SIL kills someone.", "YTA.  They offered to pay for the damage.  Who cares who was driving if they are willing to pay for the damage?  You aren't law enforcement, and you aren't her mother.  Unless she has her own bank account then their *joint bank account* is going to pay for it anyway.\n\n>My BIL makes all the money in their house and she spends it all while doing absolutely nothing. \n\nIn light of the information you withheld from your post, and then buried in the comments, this line does you ***zero*** favors.  Your SIL provides ***in-home childcare to your child!***  She isn't lazy and watching a child is hard work. \n\nIt also sounds like she's a \"social drinker\" who drinks with her friends and family but won't drink when she's responsible for someone's child.\n\nAs for the night of your car getting damaged:\n\n* Was your SIL visibly drunk?\n* Was she unable to walk in a straight line?\n* Was she slurring her words?\n\nIf she wasn't doing one of those things or all of them, she was probably fine to drive and would have passed a field sobriety test.  Most people can have a glass of wine with food and not be impaired, some people can have more than a glass and be fine.  You just want to pick a fight with them.  The end result will be a husband who is pissed off at you, and no childcare because you've pissed your SIL off.", "YTA. You aren't the one who define who will pay. Shut thr fuck up.", "You can't win this one.  You can't force a husband to make his wife face the consequences.  \n\nYou know who was driving.\n\nHe is complicit in this because he allowed her to drive drunk and is covering up for her.\n\nJust let it go.  Personally I'd go low contact with both of them.", "They\u2019re married, it\u2019s their money not his and hers, regardless of where it comes from.
