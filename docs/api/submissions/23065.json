This is a lot to deal with and harder to understand - and that\u2019s ok. \n\nYour mom asking you to go on social media to defend a full grown adult is laughable and toxic af. You are a child. It is not your responsibility to even acknowledge this, much less have the skills to defend her. Your mom is also a super AH for making you leave.

What you can do is tell your family that this is a lot to ask you to be able to handle.  High School is difficult enough when dealing with our own personal dramas.
