What you can do is tell your family that this is a lot to ask you to be able to handle.  High School is difficult enough when dealing with our own personal dramas.

People are shitty with bullying and this is a school problem, not a sister doing porn problem. \n\n\nI get why op blames her sister, but she's misplacing the blame. People will look down on those who do porn yet watch porn everyday. This is a shameful mindset that needs to die. If someone isn't doing anything to harm others than it's not your place to judge them.", "Her mother literally asked OP to go out and defend her sister.

The mother and sister are the ones who should try to educate people around them while protecting a MINOR child who is being harassed, irl and on social media, is a victim of s* crimes and is losing her friends. They should not offset this burden on OP and they should PROTECT her, instead of expecting her to protect them. \nNTA.", "OP is allowed to be upset about lost friends and the bullying she\u2019s experienced. She\u2019s explained that she blocked all messages coming in and never spoke badly of her sister. OP was minding her business when someone else decided to contact her mother.  I dont know if OP would\u2019ve cared if it hadn\u2019t gotten out to her school, but this isn\u2019t her fault. Her reaction wasn\u2019t the best but she\u2019s been dealing with all kinds of harassment just to be told she\u2019s not doing enough. Her sister is a golden child and she already has resentment towards her. In general, her sister seems incredibly spoiled.", "\u201cDid a favor\u201d\n\nSeriously?", "She's against being humiliated at school by her sister's career choice. How is that hard to understand?", "And yet here are sister and mother demanding that the little sister puts herself out there.\n\nAlmost like they need that approval.", "Pretty sure this whole post is fake", "Are you the sister?", "You need to be strong. Keep your chin high. A lot of people are going to try to ashame you or try to treath you bad. Those people are cowards trying to feed from insecurities, ashame feelings. So...dont give them food. Keep your chin high. Proud on yourself is the best self defense. And dont answer to bullies. Act like they dont exist.", "Can you show your mom?", ">and op will face the backlash from her classmates.\n\nOP is already facing the backlash from her classmates.

You puttng it out there and other will react to it, it might not be the reaction you want but those are the consequences of your choices.\n\nto me its unfair that OP has to suffer for the life choices of her older sister,  rthe sister failed to consider the affects it would have on those around her.\n\nI personally don't have anything against that profession, but it has always been controversisal and it's not a industry a person should  goes onto without serious consideration first.", "Silver_bread7 is reposting comments from other people:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158qzmn/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_will_never_accept/jtc1kbc/", "She isn't yelling at her for being an adult. She's yelling at her for making a life choice that made OP the target of extensive bullying.\n\nSister's job might be legal, but she cannot have made the choice to get into that career without knowing that a lot of people disapprove of it, or that if it got back to her hometown, it would have knock-on effects on her family's social opportunities too. She chose freely. Her family didn't get a say in that choice.

WTF is wrong with you", "OP's reaction is completely understandable.  \n\n\nA lot of her friends turned against her and her closest family turned against her. From one side she is pushed away by her friends or their parents for something she didn't even do since it wasn't her decision what her sister does. From the other side she is pushed away by her parents and her sister for again something she had no say in.  \n\n\nShe's being slapped from each side and she's being punished by both sides just because her sister decided to do that type of work.", "I was thinking the same thing. Extremely compassionate response. This is the kind of person we all need in our lives.", "The harshest and most unfortunate thing is that they are kinda right - it\u2019s those people that are the problem\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t change or solve anything. \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely NTA. You mentioned somewhere that your mother also cut off your brother, so based on this I\u2019d say if you can live with your aunt, that\u2019s the best solution.

I was just raised in a way that being angry doesn\u2019t excuse the words you say in anger. We also can\u2019t really know everything about their family dynamic apart from snippets we get from OP so I\u2019m not just gonna assume that the sister is favored. Of course she was angry, she\u2019s being bullied and her parents are doing a shit job. We\u2019re just going to have to agree to disagree about whether or not being mean to her sister, who had no bad intentions, was an asshole move.", "well she never really said that.

In no way shape or form is sex work a minor appropriate issue. Deal with it\n\nI don't care about your opinions regarding what is and isn't appropriate table talk with minors. The simple fact I pointed out was that it was pointless to further muddle the waters of communication by not referring to sex work as sex work in a situation where OP, the minor, clearly knew that her sister was involved in it. A better, more logical argument would have been to say that that topic should have never been brought up--except, oh, then OP would have had to suffer her classmates' harassment and bullying without support from her family.

I know former only fan ladies who do Real estate, personal training, recruiting, sales, computer engineering, marketing, and even writing. The thing is not many employers are gonna search, and some dont really care, especially if the worker isn't in a public facing profession. A jobs a job, if they didn't do anything illegal or unethical, then it doesn't really matter.

It's pretty shitty. When you're a teacher you see parents who do way worse shit than doing porn. Better to have a porn star mother than a crackhead parent that lets their partner molest you. This isn't a sister issue, it's an issue with the little shits bullying op never faced concequances. Unfortunately many schools won't deal with these issues because parents don't want their poor little babies to face concequances. In my mind these students need to be severely punished or even expelled. It's better they learn concequances when they can easily turn things around. If they pulled this shit in a college or a workplace they'd be expelled for fired. \n\nThe people messaging op are sexually harassing her, plain and simple.

She also said that they live in a small conservative town where everyone knows everyone's business. As someone who lives in a similar town, there are a lot of sickos who are created from that exact environment.

OP's sister is an adult, nearly 30 years old, and she's standing by while their mother joins OP's peers in bullying and ostracizing a teenager.

Asking OP to post supportive messages is a total AH move when the mom did it and would be the same if the sister did as well. I\u2019d say OP is a, very, very light AH with the comments during her blow up, but I completely get it. She feels like her life is being bombed for something she has absolutely zero control of and that sucks, especially at that age.
