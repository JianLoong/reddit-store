What you can do is tell your family that this is a lot to ask you to be able to handle.  High School is difficult enough when dealing with our own personal dramas.

People are shitty with bullying and this is a school problem, not a sister doing porn problem. \n\n\nI get why op blames her sister, but she's misplacing the blame.

She should not have to, her family should protect her, even if ideally these consequences should not occur in the first place.", "But OP is a victim of the same misogyny, except that no one tries to protect her and they expect her to suck it up in order to be supportive - publicly supportive. A minor should not be tasked with fighting this misogyny and defend s* work, she should be protected from it. It is up to the sister and the mother to publicly defend OP and s* work if they so wish, not the other way around. \nAnd OP is getting bullied for of her sister\u2019s decision (not because of her sister as she did not instigate it, but it would not have occured without her). It is unfair, but it is society, you cannot ask a 16 yo to ignore it.", "Yeah, cos teenage boys don\u2019t watch porn. /s", "Wait until you find out that their classmates will have older relatives who know ops sister well", "\u201cYou\u2019ll end up a sex worker and have to give your body to complete strangers because of how shit economy is\u201d \n\nYeah no people being forced into sex work to put bread on the table isn\u2019t actually a good argument", "I'm glad you have a support system", "Talk to you brother and your dad, show them the messages you're getting and ask for their help to report it to the school for bullying.\n\nIf you're able to get a fresh start with your aunt, grab it with both hands.  I'm sorry this is happening to you.", "Looks like your mom is about to have a fuck around and find out moment. Disowning two children is going to make the holidays rather lonely! I know you\u2019re 16 and emotions are flaring but I would look at her and say OK mom this is definitely for the best as I am not comfortable living with you or being around you since you obviously have no problem throwing your extra children away. Also, shame on your dad for allowing you to be kicked out. You might\u2019ve lucked out going to be with your aunt for your last years of high school.", "I used to subscribe to that view when I was in school, \"telling a teacher will make it worse,\" but I don't really have a clue why I used to think that way. Oh dear, these people who torment me will now also think I'm a grass?", "Agreed. You especially cannot expect a child to come to the defence of an adult, when it's the child who's getting bullied as a result of the adult's actions. \n\nOP needs support right now to deal with the problems she's experiencing at school/within her social circle; she doesn't need for her parents to blame her for her bullies' words being hurtful to someone who isn't actually the target of the bullying and doesn't have to see them and speak to them regularly.\n\nI'm deeply sympathetic to OP's sister feeling hurt that her own father has disowned her. I'm not at all sympathetic for her attempt to make OP being bullied all about herself. Yes, she's the precipitating factor but no, she isn't the victim in that situation. \n\nAnd for her mother to support her and punish OP...Terrible parenting. As much as I will never support throwing a child out, I think OP might be best off living with her aunt and starting at another school. It's just a pity her own parents won't support her against her bullies.", "https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep.html\n\nHopefully PrEP and U=U mean this is nolonger an issue", "Hahahahaha stop youre gonna wake the gf up", "Btw, I'm non-american but thought it was obvious what \"adult\" meant.\n\n\"Adult content\", or \"mature content\" has been used as code for all the countries I've been to.\n\nAlthough I would understand if it's not obvious to those not fluent in English, I don't think it's an American slang or term.", "It means that in most places, too. Not sure why you felt this was necessary.", "Want me to dumb it down for you? I absolutely will. I have arguments they\u2019re just so obvious I didn\u2019t think I needed to spell them out. When she lashed out she did so because of the audacity it takes for a grown woman to ask her 16 yr old sister why she can\u2019t post a TIKTOK defending her porn career (are you kidding me). Her sister is not a victim either this is content that can be accessed by anyone so cut the crap with the victimizing. Also yeah I said she lashed out at both when it was technically only at her sister, great observation although its a technicality that does not matter in this story so who genuinely cares.\n\nNext. The topic of sex work is being brought up during dinner. In a casual manner so you can guess they are not only calling it sex work and leaving it at that. They are talking about details and whatnot. Your argument is useless. Yes they can call it sex work in front of the minor. Now what? My whole point is that they shouldn\u2019t discuss the job and the details in front of a minor. Period.\n\nWe good?", "\"Demanded me to explain why I couldn't support her.\"\n\nMaybe you should read that part slower. The sister has 0 reason to ask that. It should be completely obvious to anyone with a shred of decency.", "can't quote as I'm on the phone, but you said something along the lines of 'all her sister did was ask OP to elaborate on why she can't support her and take action'\n\ndoes a sane person (any sane person) need an elaborate essay on why a bullied teenager in a religious town is run down by the consequences of her sister's job? \n\nand what sane person would try to then force a kid to publicly stand for an adult and her lifechoices?!?!\n\nI mean, the kid lashed out out of despair of the situation brought upon her and because of the fact that adults who should be protecting her are trying to put her on the front lines ffs \n\nand have actually KICKED her OUT of her house because she refused to do so...", "It's funny though because in this situation the 16 yo is arguably acting the most mature out of all of them.", "Who said forced?", "I can tell you why you think that. Because it's true I was bullied for close to 10 years because I was overweight and every time I told a teacher or even the principal, they got worse. The worst punishment they ever got was some talking to. They never got in trouble but they never failed to take it out on me even more after that.", "Good advice but mom took the phone", "Her sister doesn't owe her an apology. Her mom and a bunch of asshole teenagers do.", "I'm from Northern Europe and it was immediately obvious to me as well. It also translates similarly in all the languages i know. I think it's pretty universal.", ">Want me to dumb it down for you? I absolutely will. I have arguments they\u2019re just so obvious I didn\u2019t think I needed to spell them out.\n\nYes. Do you expect the people you converse with to be telepathic?\n\n>When she lashed out she did so because of the audacity it takes for a grown woman to ask her 16 yr old sister why she can\u2019t post a TIKTOK defending her porn career (are you kidding me).\n\nIt doesn't matter why she lashed out if the conflict hadn't been rising up until then. This is AITA, not am I a justified asshole. I gave OP her answer. Unnecessarily provoking conflict and saying hurtful words by definition counts as being an asshole. Grow up.\n\n>Her sister is not a victim either this is content that can be accessed by anyone so cut the crap with the victimizing.\n\nIt's like you're purposely being obtuse just to validate your perspective. Having your information leaked for malicious purposes--most likely to be outted and made fun of--isn't tolerated behavior just because her sister is a sex worker and she produces \"content that can be accessed by anyone.\" A soldier in an active warzone knows the risks of injury and death. Are you going to tell his family that he wasn't a victim simply because he was aware that the worst case scenario could occur? Delusional. \n\nHow are you going to say that minors shouldn't be exposed to sex work over dinner and then see nothing wrong with minors taking advantage of the open internet to harm a demographic notorious for being at risk?\n\n>My whole point is that they shouldn\u2019t discuss the job and the details in front of a minor.\n\nMy argument was only in reference to the last family meeting. I misread your original comment.", ">but you said something along the lines of 'all her sister did was ask OP to elaborate on why she can't support her and take action'\n\nDo you need clarification? I didn't say that \"she should be forced to defend a porn actress at school.\" Neither did the sister, because OP lashed out before that. She asked why she wouldn't. There's an actual difference there. The latter implies an attempt at communication, which leaves the possibility of actual conflict resolution. The mother was the one to \"force a kid to publicly stand for an adult and her lifechoices?!?!\" She lashed out at her sister. That is assholish behavior, regardless of whether it was justified. \n\n>does a sane person (any sane person) need an elaborate essay on why a bullied teenager in a religious town is run down by the consequences of her sister's job?\n\nDid the sister know that? You and I are operating on different levels of information than the sister and family. Was there any evidence in the post that OP had confided in her family regarding the bullying? Where in the post did it state that OP resides in a religious town?", "Nowadays I would advise my son to keep escalating it up the chain, and to make sure I'm aware of every instance too. If telling the teachers doesn't help, tell the teachers' bosses, and their boss' boss, and the boss' boss' boss, until your local politicians are sick of hearing about these bullies and the PTA has a restraining order", "OP said in a comment she comes from a small religious town.\n\nand your attempt at making a college philosophy discussion out of a highly emotional situation is laughable quite frankly... everyone lashes out at some points in their life, let alone a teenager in a situation like this. \n\nalso, we are all discussing this with the same information provided - and if you can read - you can see that OP lashed out after she was presented with her mom's deranged requests and after her sister - who was upset - DEMANDED from OP the explanation why she couldn't stand up for her.\n\nthose adults, who made their own life choices, should have taken OP into their consideration as soon as the sister started her job and instead of having casual conversations about it at diner, should have talked it over with OP and prepared her for dealing with it and dealing with the rest of the world if it comes out (as it did). \n\ninstead they failed her completely.\n\nalso, before you even start, in the comments OP has clearly stated that she tried to explain herself and the consequences calmly, but both her mom and her sister kept talking over her and wouldn't listen... sometimes the only way to be heard with those kind of AH is to shout and lash out.", "Unfortunately it doesn't work like this in France. And I only learned years later that you can sue people for harassment. They made campaigns against it when my bullies had already go to another school."]}
