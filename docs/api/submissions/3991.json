The salad is pretty simple, a bunch of bell peppers cut up with quartered cherry tomatoes, and crumbled feta cheese.

We have had arguments before, maybe once or twice a year (we've been living together since January 2016 and married since May of 2018).

I guess I just thought that offering alternatives would placate any worry about throwing out food or insulting her salad.

As she mentioned, we bought it at the market not 12 hours earlier in the day. The cheese showed no physical signs that it was bad. I would never offer my wife spoiled cheese.

It's seemingly something I really have to work on. I think that I could've avoided this conflict if I mentioned that the cheese not agreeing with my tastebuds immediately, instead of adding it on later when tensions had already escalated. Just imagine that she accepted to finish my salad for me though in the beginning, no conflict either. It's hard to convince myself that confrontation is answer because people in my experience are conflict averse like myself. It's going to be a marathon but I hope to become more confrontational and upfront going forward.

Thank you!", "As I've been reading these comments, I've been re-living the argument over and over again looking for missing clues. Now I just remembered that in the argument, I squinched my face to add emphasis to how off-putting the feta was when I first brought up the bad taste and I did it once more when she suggested to rinse off the feta in the strainer. That really could have insulted her and maybe that changes the entire dynamic of the argument. \n\nAgain, I was raised in a household where we had to clean our plates to leave the table but this feta cheese was so off I couldn't do it.

I just found the cheese to be off per my own tastebuds. I'm not sick or just overcoming a sickness either (last cold was early October (not COVID)), I think I will inquire about my wife having a cold now though, could be why our tastebuds aren't aligned on the issue.

Either way, if you found the cheese to be tasting odd, that was enough of an indication that something may have gone wrong in the process of making or preserving.  People can die by eating something that is tainted, so I still find it extremely weird that you would offer it to her OR that she'd want to eat it!

I am not as adventurous in my cheese tasting as she is, I trust her when she told me that the feta is fine. I only eat feta cheese and marble cheese.

Thank you for pointing that out, something that I never would've seen otherwise. I'm adding it to the list of things I'm going to apologize for and have a conversation about tomorrow night when we hash all of this out. Thank you so much", "I'm sorry I jumped down your throat like that, you didn't deserve that. The people on this post insinuating that I was trying to push spoiled food on my wife have made me confrontational. Her responses during the argument were pretty normal based on the history of our relationship, she knows that I like to look for solutions when conflict arises, so giving me those directions in a very serious and direct tone is normal; however, her cold shouldering and ignoring me is very out of character. Again, apologies for my initial response, you were fair to make that conclusion based on my post", "Oh okay, thank you for clarifying!", "I wouldn't say that either one of us is especially good at detecting whether or not food is going bad. We haven't really dealt with food going bad since we moved in together in January of 2016. We are good at planning our meals for the week and not over-buying fresh produce, meats, or dairy. It tasted off to me but she ate her salad no problem and after dinner last night boxed the salad up in a tupperware container, presumably to enjoy for lunch throughout the upcoming week. The feta showed not physical signs of being soiled or tainted in any way and we had purchased the feta less than 12 hours before it was served. I would never offer my wife food that I thought even had a chance of being tainted or soiled in any way", "That's you and your husband not OP and his wife\n\nNot to mention just because something tastes differently that doesn't mean it's going bad", "I\u2019m honestly in suspense wondering if she ends up sick from this. (No I don\u2019t want her sick but very curious if OP is \u201cright\u201d)", "Lol k.", "My definition of 'off' is something that doesn't taste like it tasted before. The taste had changed according to my taste buds. We hadn't eaten that salad since October, maybe my tastebuds changed, it could be anything. Based on the 'off' that I tasted last night, it was not at all spoiled, tainted, or gone bad. Again, if I even had the inkling that the cheese was ruined, I would've never offered it to my wife", "Okay. So the way your brain works contributed to the escalation of this conflict. ESH.", "This is your wife. Do you walk on eggshells around her all the time or something? This seems so odd to me.", "The point of this post is his wife's reaction and not about whether the cheese was bad or not. Whether it was or not the wife still didn't have to have such an over the top reaction to her husband not liking one single part of the entire meal.", "I never thought for a minute that the cheese was going bad, was spoiled, or was tainted. If that were the case, I never would've offered it to me wife! The taste wasn't correct to me but she felt like the salad was fine (and mentioned it in our argument). What am I supposed to do? Supercede my wife's decision-making autonomy and force her not to eat a salad that she tastes nothing wrong with? I have no experience tasting spoiled feta cheese, she loves feta cheese a lot more than me in fact. I trust her about the cheese being fine over my tastebuds disagreement with the cheese", "So glad I could help and that you actually wanted to listen!\n\nGo you!\n\nThat\u2019s perfect adulting right there!", "Hey no harm, no foul. I don't think you jumped down my throat, I made a brief and likely unfair summarization of your wife's behavior and you cleared it up. Please don't think twice about it, and I hope things work out with you and the wife.", "It could be something as simple as a different brand or different grazing for the dairy animals that gave the milk. Different time of year so different weeds, like wild onions for instance.", "She's okay so far, already went to sleep with seemingly no issues. Will update if she gets sick and I was wrong about the cheese not being spoiled", "Back when COVID caused you to lose your sense of taste and smell, the first indication I had the virus was that foods that I had eaten multiple times before started tasting slightly off. \n\nThe odd thing was I didn't  lose all my taste immediately, just some of them and then more and more as time went on. So I could still smell the food, and I could still taste it, but it would taste off. Not bad, or rotten, but just somewhat different and unappetizing.\n\nJust got COVID again, and even though I didn't completely lose my sense of taste or smell, I did experience this 'food tastes slightly off' effect again. Just saying.", "Is it possible that it wasn\u2019t feta, but a different crumbly cheese?", "I'm really glad you shared that about your repeat of Covid. Lost my sense of smell and most taste in a car wreck years ago. Had mild first case of Covid several months ago and for weeks just had zero appetite because nothing tasted right.\n\nThanks!", "Covid was honestly my first thought too. I know a lot of people who had Covid who said their first symptom was stuff tasting \u201coff\u201d.", "Yeah. The other odd thing was the degree to which some foods were affected. Fruits and vegetables were generally ok and tasted the same, but the flavours of stuff like cheese, meat or fish just went haywire.", "Yup yup. The first symptoms are usually the taste thing or an unusual sustained increase in resting heart rate. In my case I got those both before the rest of the symptoms showed up days later.", "She is treating you like a child that doesn't want to eat a perfectly good meal rather than an adult that actually likes that type of salad and is put off by a bad taste. And now she is sulking like a child? Does she usually pick fights over small stuff or is this new? Is there something else amiss?\n\nNTA. Your wife is blowing this up beyond reason. You need to have a talk about what really is going on here.", "Your tastes can also be off or change. Like a cold or something can affect the way things taste. I\u2019d think back to what you ate or drank earlier, have you been I\u2019ll or other symptoms? Was it the same brand of feta?", "NTA. I think you handled it good.", "YTA for the way you confronted her. Very passive aggressive and accusing towards her. Or that is at least the feeling I get when I read your story. \n\nJust simply say that the feta isn't tasting that good today and leave it at that. I don't get the whole trying to push it down her  troath because she ate it and making a whole thing about it. Just... Grow up?!", "Idk something about \" This feta tastes bad, my wife can take it to work\" seems  iffy to me lol", "> ESH for making a small thing into a big thing.\n\nShe did that, not OP. So why is he an asshole?", "That was my thought too. A meal i really loved, tasted really bland and bitter, 2 days later  tested positive for covid. Then my sense of smell and taste disappeared. Took a few months to go back to somewhat normal", "He thought the cheese was off and immediately offered it to his wife rather than point it out?", "He already mentioned in the comments that he didn't think it was bad, he thought it tasted different than before and he didn't like the taste. Also, she obviously didn't think it was bad, since she ate her whole plate.", "Do you expect me to come back and check every comment that comes after mine? In original post he says twice that he thought something was 'off'. Then he dodged the issue and tried other ways to get around it. Didn't seem at all the type of situation that needed subterfuge.", "NTA Does this seem like normal behaviour to you? If you don\u2019t want to eat the salad, why the heck are you receiving silent treatment over salad?\n\nThe Reddit connoisseur in me wants to believe that your wife purposely spiked your salad and she was sh*tty that you worked it out. She is not eating your portion of the salad because there is an undisclosed ingredient in there or because she gave you the day old fetta.\n\nUpdate your will and watch your back, OP.", "YTA. You made a whole big song and dance about it instead of just saying \u2018hey, is this a different feta to usual? It tasted weird to me tonight\u2019.", "My guess is She did a substitution and didn't like that you don't like it.. could be a low fat feta,a different brand, a non dairy version.. lots of things. \n\nAnyway. NTA. Nothing wrong with not liking something and you weren't rude about it.", "She got upset because you didn't want your salad? If what you're stating is all that happened, NTA.", "NTA If something doesn't taste right it doesn't taste right", "NTA\n\nIt's not impossible that it was off, it is also not impossible that you are coming down with something that has affected your taste buds so it was less appetising, or even that you have just gone off it, it really shouldn't be that big of a deal.\n\nIf I make something and my partner doesn't like it, he just has to tell me that he wasn't a fan or wasn't keen, and that is the end of it. If he wants something else he can help himself and if there are left overs I will either eat them myself or throw them out.\n\nYour wife's reaction seems very over the top. There may well be more behind it from her perspective, but if there is something else bothering her she should use her words and communicate that to you, rather than giving you the silent treatment.", "I bought by accident a different brand of feta the other day. \"Insert Country Name\" feta - should have known better as our country is not well known for being the best feta producers on this planet! \n\nBlegh! Eventually not to waste, added as a pizza topping - nope, squishy & dry. I need to start paying attention when buying certain stuff.\n\nNTA.", "Lol did she server you spoiled feta?", "I\u2019m going to go with ESH \nYour wife way over reacted but also you couldn\u2019t go \u201chmm the feta tastes weird to me today , I think I\u2019ll skip on the rest of the salad \u201c", "NTA She's poisoning you! Kidding but her behavior is as off as that feta.", "YTA for how you went about this whole thing. Why did you not simply say \"this tastes funny, I think the cheese might be bad\"? Instead you went through this whole charade of offering her food, asking about packing it up, etc, etc. Honestly why? Do you think she was deliberately trying to feed you bad cheese? Do you think it's some kind of secret plot to slowly kill you with aged fetta?", "Jesus, it\u2019s salad. ESH.", "That is a ridiculous thing to fight over, have you checked the feta package, could have goats milk in it...if you dont like goat's milk, it will taste off", "Hmm, did she add a secret ingredient...*of poison*...to his plate?", "I do this to my boyfriend all the time! \ud83e\udd23  I say \"this is disgusting, do you want it?\" He says everytime i say it there has never been anything wrong with the food except one time. I baked a banana cream pie and it tasted like banana cement.", "I HATE when my husband does this lol. He'll pick things out of his food and put them on my plate. Even if it's something I like and he doesn't, I don't want it anymore in that context! But I understand that's a personal preference thing.", "If you could taste the bad feta but your wife couldn't, she should probably be the one taking the Covid test.", "I think you\u2019re mixing up confrontation and honesty. It\u2019s not \u201cconfrontational\u201d in any way to say \u201chey this cheese doesn\u2019t taste right to me\u201d, it\u2019s just the truth. You may need to be more confrontational in other aspects of your life, like say for example if your wife hurts your feelings and you need to talk about it, but being *honest* is not the same thing. The conflict happened here at least in part because you didn\u2019t tell the truth, you danced around it.", "Why is something 'off' meaning it's spoilt or bad? It could mean that the oil it came in was different or something. \nNTA and your wife is either an absolute assailed and did something to your portion - hence why she's so against it being lunch for the next day - or there's nothing wrong and she's an asshole for not understanding that it wasn't to OPs taste this time. \nNot once did he go overboard with what he said. His wife ate it all. So he assumed she was fine with it. Where's the bad reasoning here?", "Maybe let the OP know his family better than us complete Internet strangers - yourself included- do?", "I like how apparently OP was TA for being condescending, but all of your responses are positively dripping with condescension", "Or it could be low-fat or something. Which is awful imo.\n\nSome things are meant to be enjoyed in small amounts and should be kept full fat. Portions are the important part", "If he knew his wife better. They wouldn't be having this fight to begin with."]}
