She asked me if I would create a new logo for the overarching company, as well as 5 additional logos for her subsidiary departments and social media carousels as needed.\n\nAs a bit of background, this friend has never struck me as struggling financially at all. She owns her house and does not have a mortgage (since her parents own it), she doesn\u2019t have a car payment, and from what it sounds like, she makes quite a bit of money servicing wealthy clients in Park City and the surrounding areas.\n\nYesterday, she invited me to dinner under the guise of meeting her new partner. During this conversation, she bragged extensively about how they had just bought a 5-acre plot of land in the mountains that they were planning on turning into a yurt AirBnB, and all of the trips they were planning on taking that could be written off as \u201cbusiness expenses\u201d. She also mentioned that she had slept with a man the previous night for $500 and was planning on making this a regular stream of income. The cherry on top is that she is leaving for a 10-day trip to Europe tomorrow. So, again, not strapped for cash as it appears.\n\nHowever, twice in this conversation, she casually mentioned that she couldn\u2019t afford to pay me for the design work I\u2019ve been completing for her, as her full-service business contract is in limbo with the ski lodge. The first time she mentioned it, I thought she was joking and laughed it off. But the second time she said she couldn\u2019t pay me was as I was headed out the door, and she quickly followed it up with saying that maybe one day she\u2019d surprise me with a trip and pay for me. \n\nI\u2019ve been stewing all day on how she basically tried to sugarcoat the fact that she is planning to not pay me the almost $600 she owes me. Would I be the asshole if I sent a text telling her I couldn\u2019t work for her until she paid at least for the logos I\u2019ve delivered to her already? I should have told her up front my pricing, but I really didn\u2019t imagine she would expect me to do this as a favor, and had originally planned to invoice her upon completion.", "created_utc": 1699140164, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17nyi4q/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_i_cant_do_graphic/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do think you made a mistake assuming she would pay you. The time to clarify would have been when she first asked you to do the work. At that point, you could have shown her your hourly fee and given her an estimate. At that point she could ask if you'd discount for friends or whatever.\n\nSo at this point, what you have is an ugly miscommunication. She thinks she asked for a favor and you agreed. You think she asked for your professional service, and **that's** what you agreed to. And it sounds like you've got no paperwork and not even a handshake agreement, because you never talked about terms. \n\nGiven the lack of formality, your options are limited. At a minimum I think you could say, \"I thought you were asking for my professional services! I'm afraid I can't do any more work for free.\" There are some other commenters suggesting that you take her to small claims court. Given the lack of agreement, even verbal, my hunch is that you don't have much of a case. \n\nBe careful letting her \"buy you a trip\"! The deal might include an extra man in your bed.", "NTA, you have a business, your business needs income, she owes you for your designs. No, you don't do any more work, nor finish any work until you get some money.", "NTA. She *absolutely* has to pay you for your work and it's gross of her to brag about her income and travels and then claim to not be able to pay you. No is a complete sentence. No new work until she pays you for the work you've already done, and no more work unless she agrees to pay for it. Going forward, get at least half before you even start working.", "NTA\n\nShe happily bragged that she made $500 the night before so she can pay you the money. \n\nDon\u2019t do anymore work until she pays you.", "NTA- if you're going to work for a fee, you need to be willing to fight for your fee when necessary or be taken average of often.", "NTA\n\nDo not do any more work for her until she pays you. Unfortunately I have a feeling you won\u2019t see the money for the logos you have already delivered to her but at the very least you can deny her the rest.", "YWNBTA\n\nIf she doesn't pay, take her to small claims court.", "No as a friend she should offer and then you can turn it down. But not for free, maybe a discount at most.", "You don't ask a practicing lawyer for advice and expect not to be billed. You shouldn't get art from an artist and expect not to be invoiced.\n\nNTA, but lesson learned - be upfront about your prices from here on out.", "YWNBTA. It's your time and effort and if she has enough money for vacations and all the other things she bragged about then she def has enough money to pay you for your work.", "NTA.   \nShe knows you were planning to invoice you - because she\u2019s intimating that she won\u2019t pay for them due to her business cash issues.   \nSend her the invoice. On it (or the email) indicate a \u2018friends discount\u2019 so she can\u2019t complain\u2026 \u201cNormally this work would be well over $600, but as a friend I can drop more than 10% off\u2026 so$540 for you\u201d and then hold firm. If she doesn\u2019t pay it tell her \u201cI want this paid, otherwise I\u2019ll need to take you to small claims court - I have expenses too, and my accountant is on my back about this bad debt\u201d.", "NTA, Don\u2019t do any more work until she pays you. This is the exact reason I have every client, including family and friends, sign a contract and pay at least 50% before I even start.", "I would not provide her with the final product of what you created. Tell her she can have it when she pays you and provide her with your rate sheet. If you already provided it,  send her an invoice and then follow up on whatever terms you have (30, 60, 90 day). Take this as a lesson to not work without a contract.", "NTA. However, since you've never spoken to her about payment, it's pretty clear that she \\*could\\* have misunderstood and thought that you were going to do the work for her for free as \"a favour\" since you're friends. \n\nThe only thing I think you can do is tell her, \"I'm sorry if I didn't communicate my terms better to you until now. It's okay if you don't pay me for the work I've already done, since there has been miscommunication, and you may not have realised I expected a payment. However, I will only do more work for you once you agree to pay \\*such and such\\* hourly fee for my work. This is the contract to sign for my services.\"", "Nta.

Seems she has 500 dollars she could use to pay you at least", "Didn't you give her a contract to sign? Don't ever do work until the person has signed the contract.", "NTA- Tell her that there may have been a misunderstanding and while you were going to give her a friendly rate, free never entered your mind and that by her saying she isnt going to pay bc of her \u2018excuse\u2019 that shows even she knows that is not how this should be going.

Stand up for yourself.", "NTA.   But when she asked  you, you should have told her your price for the job.\nI wouldn't any more for her", "NTA. Do not complete any more work until you are paid, and tell her she cannot use the graphics you have already made until she pays you for them. As they are your designs you own them and this is legally enforceable. Copyright law is with the artist unless there is a work for hire contract in place.", "NTA this is a no brainier. It's not even if she has the money at this point she wants your hard work for free. She can go find someone else and if she wants to resume business she will need to sign a formal agreement for payment.", "I appreciate your frankness! That\u2019s definitely where I\u2019m struggling, because I do admit that I should have been more clear in the terms. It\u2019s been a long road for me with asking people to pay me for my work at a rate that is competitive, and I\u2019ve struggled in the past with just saying \u201cno worries\u201d but then getting taken advantage of. Definitely a good lesson to me that regardless of whether I\u2019m working for friends or strangers, I need to have a contract or written agreement. At the very least, I clarified I\u2019d pay my way, and it would be okay if she didn\u2019t pay me at all, I just wouldn\u2019t do anymore work for her.", "I really like the phrase that no is a complete sentence!

Thank you!", "At this point I feel like I\u2019d even take just 50% since it was my miscommunication. But I am surprised that not even once did she offer to pay, and there was no opportunity to even say \u201cno, it\u2019s okay/yes, that would be great.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize the hole I\u2019d dug until it was too late.", "NTA.  Business is business.  Always get it in writing and a partial payment.  If they don't think they should pay because you are friends, they don't respect you.  Don't ever work for free.  Your rates are your rates, they are welcome to pay that or find someone else.", "Make sure any proofs you send in the future are watermarked. Upon receipt of FULL payment is when you will then send the final files.", "It wasn\u2019t your miscommunication. She thinks she can exploit you by taking your work and not paying you. Unless you\u2019re leaving something major out, this is not at all on you. It\u2019s up to you if you\u2019re going to let her push you around or if you\u2019ll be clear that you will not do more work for her without payment for what has already been delivered."]}
