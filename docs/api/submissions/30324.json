She asked me if I would create a new logo for the overarching company, as well as 5 additional logos for her subsidiary departments and social media carousels as needed.\n\nAs a bit of background, this friend has never struck me as struggling financially at all. She owns her house and does not have a mortgage (since her parents own it), she doesn\u2019t have a car payment, and from what it sounds like, she makes quite a bit of money servicing wealthy clients in Park City and the surrounding areas.\n\nYesterday, she invited me to dinner under the guise of meeting her new partner. During this conversation, she bragged extensively about how they had just bought a 5-acre plot of land in the mountains that they were planning on turning into a yurt AirBnB, and all of the trips they were planning on taking that could be written off as \u201cbusiness expenses\u201d. She also mentioned that she had slept with a man the previous night for $500 and was planning on making this a regular stream of income. The cherry on top is that she is leaving for a 10-day trip to Europe tomorrow. So, again, not strapped for cash as it appears.\n\nHowever, twice in this conversation, she casually mentioned that she couldn\u2019t afford to pay me for the design work I\u2019ve been completing for her, as her full-service business contract is in limbo with the ski lodge. The first time she mentioned it, I thought she was joking and laughed it off. But the second time she said she couldn\u2019t pay me was as I was headed out the door, and she quickly followed it up with saying that maybe one day she\u2019d surprise me with a trip and pay for me. \n\nI\u2019ve been stewing all day on how she basically tried to sugarcoat the fact that she is planning to not pay me the almost $600 she owes me. Would I be the asshole if I sent a text telling her I couldn\u2019t work for her until she paid at least for the logos I\u2019ve delivered to her already? I should have told her up front my pricing, but I really didn\u2019t imagine she would expect me to do this as a favor, and had originally planned to invoice her upon completion.\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for the input! I sent her the text and she responded positively, albeit appearing to backpedal a little bit. I\u2019m going to draft my own contracts moving forward, even for work that\u2019s \u201cjust for friends,\u201d since a lot of you have importantly pointed out that there is no distinction between friend/client when it comes to business, and things should be more professional to cover all the bases. It\u2019s easy to fall into something quickly without realizing what you\u2019re fully getting into, and I take responsibility for that, at least.

I do think you made a mistake assuming she would pay you. The time to clarify would have been when she first asked you to do the work. At that point, you could have shown her your hourly fee and given her an estimate. At that point she could ask if you'd discount for friends or whatever.\n\nSo at this point, what you have is an ugly miscommunication. She thinks she asked for a favor and you agreed. You think she asked for your professional service, and **that's** what you agreed to. And it sounds like you've got no paperwork and not even a handshake agreement, because you never talked about terms. \n\nGiven the lack of formality, your options are limited. At a minimum I think you could say, \"I thought you were asking for my professional services! I'm afraid I can't do any more work for free.\" There are some other commenters suggesting that you take her to small claims court. Given the lack of agreement, even verbal, my hunch is that you don't have much of a case. \n\nBe careful letting her \"buy you a trip\"! The deal might include an extra man in your bed.", "NTA, you have a business, your business needs income, she owes you for your designs. No, you don't do any more work, nor finish any work until you get some money.", "NTA.

Going forward, get at least half before you even start working.", "NTA\n\nShe happily bragged that she made $500 the night before so she can pay you the money. \n\nDon\u2019t do anymore work until she pays you.", "NTA- if you're going to work for a fee, you need to be willing to fight for your fee when necessary or be taken average of often.", "NTA\n\nDo not do any more work for her until she pays you.

Take this as a lesson to not work without a contract.", "NTA. However, since you've never spoken to her about payment, it's pretty clear that she \\*could\\* have misunderstood and thought that you were going to do the work for her for free as \"a favour\" since you're friends. \n\nThe only thing I think you can do is tell her, \"I'm sorry if I didn't communicate my terms better to you until now. It's okay if you don't pay me for the work I've already done, since there has been miscommunication, and you may not have realised I expected a payment.
