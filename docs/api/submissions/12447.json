I understand that you got upset because you're worried about her and your niece/nephew, but yelling isn't going to solve this. She's dealing with a lot, especially for someone so young. She is probably grieving the loss of the father of the baby and grief can make it hard to think or make decisions. On top of that, it sounds like your mom isn't really offering much help or support, so she is kind of on her own here in dealing with all the normal challenges of having a baby at a young age. \n\nI would say offer her whatever help you are willing/able to provide in preparing for the baby, and then step back and let her figure it out for herself when she is ready to face this.", "Honestly, she's probably in a bit of denial.\n\nNAH", "NTA, but as young as she is, she still believes everything will work out.

Everything you said was right. But a child has no comprehension of having to balance a job, a baby, school, etc. This isn't even touching the subject of whether she thinks she's gonna have a social life for the foreseeable future, OR the loss of her boyfriend. I guarantee that when that baby comes out, the absence of her deceased boyfriend is going to hit her hard.

You want her to think about this more but not completely freak her out and at moments she cant back on.  Remember,  there aren't going to be a lot of employers falling over to hire her right now and her example and daily support  is your mom. The last thing she needs is to feel like this is a terrible thing because she can't go back.  \n\nI would recommend being emotionally supportive and then revisiting the conversation about plans when things are calm and she hasn't just had her bank card fail.

There was at least 8-10 'couples' in their similar situation.  A good number of attendees were also 'generational teen parents'. \n\nThe godmother of this young mom-to-be, is the type to display wealth, talk about wealth, has to get the best of everything in life, would often gift the girl over-the-top expensive things neither of her parents/extended family could afford,  she often seemed to like showing up, kwim?   She did that for holidays, bdays, etc.  All that did was feed a severe sense of entitlement in that young, impressionable girl, now having a kid of her own.  It was uncomfortable for the parents/family every time.   \n\nFor the baby shower, the godmother took hold of her shower registry, which was quite normal initially, and switched everything in there to her bougie standards.  It was honestly so distasteful, from $27 shampoos to the full Britax stroller/car seat combo, which of course the godmother purchased and toted into the shower and made sure everyone knew it was from her.  Everything on that list  was things you would expect to see for a couple of above average means, with a high income social circle or, say, a celebrity....like in what world do you think any of the attendees can afford anything off that list?   There was also a push for family to go in for this over-the-top super expensive full kid bedroom set, dresser, rocker, convertible crib, etc....family was asked to pitch in for this of course.\n\nHere's what I remember, I was 25 with my first, married, both of us employed, living on our own independently, purchasing our first home.  I had a very modest baby shower, I recall my cousin gifting me her modest crib, I purchased the diaper changer thingy from a friend, and bought the new mattresses for both.  My car seat and stroller was safe and inexpensive, WELL within my means.  I think I recall 'splurging' on what ended up being a crappy glider.  My dad (RIP)- could not take seeing me in that uncomfortable thing, and bought me a lazyboy recliner I had for WAYYYY to many years lol. \n\nYet here in a different generation, a couple with no housing (couch surfing in a way)- no stable life, income, plans, etc....is expecting baby items in this category?  It's just surreal the entitlement.  \n\nSo yeah, sorry, but imo,  teens and young adults that aren't prepared in life, should not be pulling ridiculous stunts like this or expecting 'society' to gift you everything you can't afford.

She'll have to learn on her own how to grow up very quickly or she will lose the baby to the state in the end. It is NOT your responsibility to take guardianship or custody of that child at any time unless you so choose that.

So sad", "NTA, I probably would have yelled at her also. She needed the reality check even if she didn't want it. She needs to look into WIC, Tanf, food stamps and any other government programs that can assist her. \nOther people are commenting that she needs to apply for Social Security for the baby. This is only an option if the father was old enough to work and paid into Social Security. If he was also a teen, there would be little to no SS. \nA discussion needs to be had with the father's family. They should be help with the baby so the burden isn't all on you and your family.", "Well I guess this takes time...
