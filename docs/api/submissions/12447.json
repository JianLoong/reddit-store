I understand that you got upset because you're worried about her and your niece/nephew, but yelling isn't going to solve this. She's dealing with a lot, especially for someone so young. She is probably grieving the loss of the father of the baby and grief can make it hard to think or make decisions. On top of that, it sounds like your mom isn't really offering much help or support, so she is kind of on her own here in dealing with all the normal challenges of having a baby at a young age. \n\nI would say offer her whatever help you are willing/able to provide in preparing for the baby, and then step back and let her figure it out for herself when she is ready to face this.", "Honestly, she's probably in a bit of denial.\n\nNAH", "NTA, but as young as she is, she still believes everything will work out.

Everything you said was right. But a child has no comprehension of having to balance a job, a baby, school, etc. This isn't even touching the subject of whether she thinks she's gonna have a social life for the foreseeable future, OR the loss of her boyfriend. I guarantee that when that baby comes out, the absence of her deceased boyfriend is going to hit her hard.

She's sees it when she looks at her changing body, she feels it when she moves or hurts, and the fear of labor and delivery is probably weighing on the back of her mind.  She lost her boyfriend and her body is changing in ways that may be permanent and change how guys look at her.

You want her to think about this more but not completely freak her out and at moments she cant back on.  Remember,  there aren't going to be a lot of employers falling over to hire her right now and her example and daily support  is your mom. The last thing she needs is to feel like this is a terrible thing because she can't go back.  \n\nI would recommend being emotionally supportive and then revisiting the conversation about plans when things are calm and she hasn't just had her bank card fail.

You can't ask someone else to raise your child while you get your life together, and then just expect to get the child back and live happily ever after. I feel bad for the temporary guardians in that scenario, and the child who experienced the trauma of being taken away from the guardians who raised her.", "Sorry to hear. \n\nClearly based on her lack of initiative to plan, reckless spending, avoidance in proper discussion on caretaking - she is not mentally mature or in the right mindset to be properly taking care of your future niece/nephew. Maybe, she will snap out of it once the baby is born - but there's a solid possibility that she will continue her habits without proper prioritizing for her future child.\n\nu/hepindol sad to say at 28 you're living as a multigenerational caretaker - caring for mum, caring for younger sister, and soon caring for younger niece/nephew. It's not going to be easy at all.", "Tell them it's slang. Tell them a Coke to Jesus moment means when you really f' up. \n\nCap means lie or fake because of some random TikTok bs. Let's see what your kids can accomplish.", "It takes one google search. It is not wrong to comment back to misinformation to inform any women reading this that, yes, they do have options. In what world does telling young girls they just don\u2019t have a choice help anything?", "Lol, this is a whole lot of projecting. I never commented on the girl outside of saying that she does have a choice. All I am saying is that people like you, immediately commenting that she doesn\u2019t have a choice, are the reason a lot of young girls don\u2019t know that seeking out clinics with funding is even an option. \n\nI\u2019m not sure who would expect abortion funding and clinics to be advertised, and the funds and clinics can be found easily with a google search. No one is calling anyone an idiot for informing people that you are leading any young girl reading that comment to believe they don\u2019t have any choice at all.", "[deleted]", "So I used to be very pro-adoption, until I actually started listening to birth mothers and adopted adults. Adoption is incredibly traumatic for children. The best case scenario is to help mothers find the support they need to properly raise their child. This girl is clearly already traumatized from losing her boyfriend, she needs support. My mom had me at 15, it was hard and for many years we relied on government assistance. But we made it through. OP isn't an asshole for trying to get his sister to be realistic and make a plan. But adoption shouldn't be thrown out as the easy option when it's proven to be trauma. Adoption should be the last route when all other steps have been exhausted and there's no other way for the child to be cared for by family.\n\nGood article that talks about adoption tramua:\nhttps://mariedolfi.com/adoption-resource/relinquishment-trauma-the-forgotten-trauma/#:~:text=Without%20resolution%20of%20the%20developmental,grief%20and%20fears%20of%20abandonment.", "Correct, it is indeed horrible to tell young girls they don't have a choice.\n\nMy point is that this unfortunately does happen. This is why we fight for education, rights, bodily autonomy, equality, etc. Because these things are not a given for many.\n\nThis is not spreading misinformation. This is being cognizant that many women and girls still live in oppressive situations, and that it's more complex than \"just google it\".\n\nDon't assume that Google is a replacement for education and autonomy. If it was, the world would look very different.", "Lmao cause that's what I'm doing.\n\nContraception fails constantly. Proper use isn't followed usually, nothing is 100% to begin with, and realistically, it's nearly just as likely she did use protection and it failed.\n\nYour assumptions based on \"statistical likelihood\" are problematic. We don't know her situation enough to judge how she got pregnant."]}
