When she checked her account, there was $93 in it. 93 bucks. And she was laughing. That about did it for me. I bought the stroller and kept composure until we went outside.

Start sending her information for WIC (this is US dependent, not sure of your location) and other social services for pregnant folks in your area. \n\nStop offering advice or money.", "NAH. I understand that you got upset because you're worried about her and your niece/nephew, but yelling isn't going to solve this. She's dealing with a lot, especially for someone so young. She is probably grieving the loss of the father of the baby and grief can make it hard to think or make decisions. On top of that, it sounds like your mom isn't really offering much help or support, so she is kind of on her own here in dealing with all the normal challenges of having a baby at a young age. \n\nI would say offer her whatever help you are willing/able to provide in preparing for the baby, and then step back and let her figure it out for herself when she is ready to face this.", "Honestly, she's probably in a bit of denial.\n\nNAH", "NTA, but as young as she is, she still believes everything will work out.

Probably whatever plans they had about how to take care of the baby disappeared. You don't need to punish or scold her further - she is 6-months pregnant and she can't really hit the breaks. It is real for her. Yes, she is most likely in denial, but what is the alternative - cry and fall into depression? She will need your and your family help and it is great that you are offering to help her with planning, but maybe she is steering away because she is expecting more yelling and scolding.", "So if you have offered to make plans multiple times I will go with NAH,you want the best for her and tried to help while she evaded the issue and this was a wakeup call.\n\nShe isn't an A because as you mentioned she most likely has problems and would need therapy,going through the pregnancy alone because her bf died,to top that at her age which is already disastrous.\n\nThis issue needs to be Adressen and there is a whole lot of work to do because kids need time,patience and a whole lot of money,she probably is aware that she stands shortly before a dead end,try to be positive and Show her how she could get through all of this", "NTA.

Better for her to not live in denial", "If she isn't working and mom isn't either, why isn't she applying for medicaid or aid in her state? She needs help. That said, I hope the stroller you bought on her behalf was adequate and within your means; this sounds harsh, but if it's a high end stroller, exchange it for a safe but inexpensive one. She needs a reality check.  \nShe is in fantasy land right now, and yes you should sit down with her to offer advice on where to get state aid and how to think hard about needs vs. wants. if she will do that, if not; just write the information down and leave it with her.  \nSounding harsh here; do not enable her by buying her things she doesn't need right now - a stroller is a nice to have early on, not a necessity. She can buy a snugly to hold the baby to her chest and walk hands free until baby gets too big for that. (You should have told her you were sorry she didn't have enough to cover the stroller, and offer to go look for a snugly as a solution.)", "NTA.

NTA but maybe think about helping her get snap/heap/wic so she has a shot.", "NTA, but this can devolve quickly into TA territory in regards to how your sister sees you.\n\nYou were right. Everything you said was right. But a child has no comprehension of having to balance a job, a baby, school, etc. This isn't even touching the subject of whether she thinks she's gonna have a social life for the foreseeable future, OR the loss of her boyfriend. I guarantee that when that baby comes out, the absence of her deceased boyfriend is going to hit her hard. You're lecturing someone at a time in their life when they normally would be resistant to it, not counting a baby being on the way. Find a way to communicate that reaches her, because this isn't the way (again....everything you're saying is right)\n\nWhat role does your mom have in this? Has she offered advice? The thing is, the more you give your sister the harsh truth, the more she will probably pull away. \n\nAnd if money is a factor, please try Facebook Marketplace or the various Buy Nothing groups on Facebook for stuff.", "YTA\n\nYou're a grown adult yelling at an underage girl because she doesn't have her life in order. Did you have your life in order at 17? Add into that the fact she made a bad decision getting pregnant so young, and that the one person whos responsibility it was to help is no longer here, and you're going to be a mess. She needs a lot of support right now and if you can't handle being supportive you shouldn't be around her. Yelling at her is the last thing she needs. You shouldn't have done that. \n\nIt was gracious of you to buy the stroller for her but i think that's where you should end it. Unless you yourself can grow and keep yourself composed around her for the inevitable mistakes shes going to make as a teenager and a new mom.", "NTA, you handled it beautifully. Including the part where you actually bought the stroller. Having a baby is a total game changer. You have every right to be concerned. Hell, I'm concerned. She sounds oblivious to the reality of her situation, and unfortunately, the baby is going to be the one suffering the consequences. Praying she pulls her head out of her ass for the baby's sake and yours.", "NTA you did what you had to do and the real world is going to teach her a harsher lesson than you ever will.\n\nPeople like her have zero clue what they're in for. Sure ppl might fawn over her and the cute baby for a few weeks but after that it will be go time.\n\nShe isn't financially, mentally and emotionally prepared. So what's her plan. Is she even aware of how harshly she will be judged for being a teen mom?\n\nShe just had you spent your hard earned money on her fuck up. What's next?\n\nFYI be prepared to set hard boundaries because she is going to bug you for money and free babysitting", "NTA. I hope maybe giving birth and seeing her baby\u2019s face will snap her out of it.\n\nEven if you were harsh, you\u2019re allowed to have feelings too. It sounds like you have an incredible amount of empathy for her. That sounds like an awful situation to be in, I would also hate to have to watch my own sister go through this. \n\nWishing you the best \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nThis feels like genuine tough love to me. It doesn\u2019t sound like you said anything unkind or belittling. \n\nYou told her that she needs to get her shit together for the sake of this human life she\u2019s bringing into the world. She needs to be realistic about how to manage this extremely difficult circumstance.", "She\u2019s clearly grieving greatly right now and this kid is what she has left. It might not be feasible, but I can understand why she\u2019s in denial about it. \n\nNTA, but try to be a little bit more gentle and help where you can", "NTA - but unless you are about to convince her of an abortion, not the best approach.\n\nShe is pregnant, young and not thinking straight. She is also mourning. Probably very fragile.\n\nI would support her even if she doesn\u2019t listen to you. She is unfortunately in a situation where post partum depression is likely.\n\nI know its going to be frustrating and it is not your problem.

She\u2019s still a child herself and doesn\u2019t realize that she\u2019s going to have a baby very soon and reality is gonna knock her on her ass. Send her the info on WIC, Medicaid (she can sign herself and baby up), SNAP, etc.", "NTA she needs a reality check, kids are hard, time consuming and VERY expensive!

Watch she's going to be regularly asking you for help along with money once the baby is born.", "That's the thing, I have no idea what her plan is.

I doubt they had plans.", "So my mom isn't saying much about it, but she doesn't say much about anything.

I'm in my late 30s with two very young children, and i still don't have all the answers. The thought of going through it while still in high school is scary.\n\nDon't approach this as her needing to be prepared. No one is ever prepared for their first child. You can think you are, but you're not. Instead, focus on her acknowledging the basic needs and go from there. I'm happy to talk more if you want helpful resources or advice via PM.", "That seems unlikely given that the coming baby is her last connection with her dead partner.
