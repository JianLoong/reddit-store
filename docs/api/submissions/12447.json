I understand that you got upset because you're worried about her and your niece/nephew, but yelling isn't going to solve this. She's dealing with a lot, especially for someone so young. She is probably grieving the loss of the father of the baby and grief can make it hard to think or make decisions. On top of that, it sounds like your mom isn't really offering much help or support, so she is kind of on her own here in dealing with all the normal challenges of having a baby at a young age. \n\nI would say offer her whatever help you are willing/able to provide in preparing for the baby, and then step back and let her figure it out for herself when she is ready to face this.", "Honestly, she's probably in a bit of denial.\n\nNAH", "NTA, but as young as she is, she still believes everything will work out.

Everything you said was right. But a child has no comprehension of having to balance a job, a baby, school, etc. This isn't even touching the subject of whether she thinks she's gonna have a social life for the foreseeable future, OR the loss of her boyfriend. I guarantee that when that baby comes out, the absence of her deceased boyfriend is going to hit her hard.

She's sees it when she looks at her changing body, she feels it when she moves or hurts, and the fear of labor and delivery is probably weighing on the back of her mind.  She lost her boyfriend and her body is changing in ways that may be permanent and change how guys look at her.

You want her to think about this more but not completely freak her out and at moments she cant back on.  Remember,  there aren't going to be a lot of employers falling over to hire her right now and her example and daily support  is your mom. The last thing she needs is to feel like this is a terrible thing because she can't go back.  \n\nI would recommend being emotionally supportive and then revisiting the conversation about plans when things are calm and she hasn't just had her bank card fail.

Whether sister is ready or not she needs to face the future. If she's unable to cope with being a parent, alternative arrangements will need to be made for the baby.\n\nWe can sympathize with her to a point - and that point is where she's not doing right by the baby.", "Lol what? The alternative is to face reality and figure out how she is going to care for this child she\u2019s bringing into the world, or realize she can\u2019t and give it up for adoption.", "Speaking of support, maybe the child's grandparents could help financially on their sons behalf?", "Mom is not mentally stable, it's not entirely her fault she isn't helping out.", "Coke to Jesus", "Coke to Jesus gave me a much needed giggle lol", "What does coke to Jesus talk mean?", "It's really great that you want to help your family but it's also important to set boundaries with your family. Your sister might take advantage of your kindness and try to get you to pay for everything.", "That's all true, but will not change the sister's emotional response or willingness to engage with those issue.", "Who said she had a choice? Sounds like OP is in the US. 26 states have outlawed abortion since June of last year, and it's been more than six months since then.", "It\u2019s not a choice", "Well at least now that she\u2019s not taking to you you won\u2019t be bothered by her problems anymore", "No way. Like the commenter bellow mentioned, this baby is her connection to her boyfriend, she's far from considering adoption.", "Adoption is the way.", "The Newest Testament sure is pretty liberal.", "That coke is strong enough to raise the dead!", "That's an obvious error. Jesus did molly, not coke.", "They meant a \"COME\" to Jesus meeting.", "This! She needs to hear this now because she either a) isn't going to think about her dire circumstances until she has a screaming, dirty, hungry baby in her arms or b) believes you will be the one to step in and fund/raise this child.\n\nGive her a harsh look at reality NOW! Sign her up for a parenting class if you think that will help scare her straight. Tell her in no uncertain terms that you won't be giving her a penny and won't be babysitting. Ask her outright how she's going to get the money to feed, diaper, and clothe this baby. Ask her what her plans are for her own future. If she can't answer you (and even if she tries), I would still encourage her to think about adoption. Better to give this kid away to parents who can take care of it that let your teenage sister with no money, no job, and no prospects neglect it.", "There are funds for every clinic that will help with travel, lodging, and procedure expenses if her sister lives in an illegal state and if financial hardship is proven. There are choices.", "She chose to have unprotected sex with her boyfriend and chose not to take the morning after pill and is choosing not to put the child up for adoption, right?", "I disagree. While it may be a solution, the mother needs to be in the right frame of mind to do so. This MUST be her choice or she will always feel as if her baby was taken from her.\n\nThat is why I find programms for young parents to help them take care of their children very important.\n\nIt is easy to say give the baby away when you are not emotionally involved.", "Adoption isn't some magical word that guarantees a kid will be better off or even placed with a decent family. Many studies show that kids are better off with their biological parent(s) in almost every case except when abuse is present. OP's sister has a support network, which is more than most.", "ATHEY!", "I thought Jesus did Mary Magdalene, not Molly.", "Ooohhhh lol. I was like great a new phrase I have to remember \ud83e\udd23. My kids teach me new slang daily lol.", "And a 16 year old with a dead partner and disabled mother who is so far in denial due to the sheer stress of her situation is supposed to know that how? How would she even know where to start, and would the doctors in her area actually help her? There are pro-life, anti-woman doctors especially in states where it's illegal.", "There aren\u2019t any resources to care for the child. There is no maturity. The way people casually have children..? It is a the biggest challenge ever to raise adults, and this girl is not equipped to do so, from OPs description.", "> OP's sister has a support network, which is more than most.\n\nDoes she? She only has OP / the brother. \n\nMom is checked out mentally and dad is dead. I'm guessing preggo sister doesn't have a relationship with dead bf's parents (that or it may be a bit sour)?  \n\n\nThere's no consideration here with regards to OP and his needs or plans to support his own family (if he has one or wanted to have one but is burdened by having to take care of mom + sister + future niece/nephew).", "No, no, you see, that was *exorcism*, performed privately. The good book says he gave it to her 7 times. \n\nI wish I had as much stamina as Jesus.", "Probably would be easier if people like you didn\u2019t spread misinfo. Nobody said she was supposed to do anything, you just said she doesn\u2019t have a choice when she does. And I literally said clinics in legal states will pay for travel and lodging expenses, so what does that have to do with pro-life doctors exactly? Why would a pro-life doctor be\u2026.working at an abortion clinic\u2026..performing abortions all day?"]}
