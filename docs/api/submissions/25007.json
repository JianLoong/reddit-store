I was their only child for 14 years and in all the years I was living with them, they never believed in nice things or treating me for any reason. They had the money. My mom was often buying more makeup and shoes and my dad was into golf so their money went on their hobbies and I had basics for everything. Anything I wanted I was told no. Christmas and Birthdays were for practical gifts. School supplies they bought without me because it was basically plain everything and they didn't want me complaining about wanting a character backpack or a pink pencil or something.\n\nI always remember it was really hot one summer and I was 8 years old maybe. An ice cream truck stopped in our neighborhood and all the kids were getting ice creams so I approached my parents who were talking to some neighbors and I asked if I could have the money for one too. They said no, because ice cream was not an essential and I could go inside and get some water if I wanted to cool down. A neighbor offered to pay for my ice cream and my parents put a stop to that as well. I went inside for the rest of the day anyway because I was upset and jealous watching all the other kids eat their ice creams and knowing my parents wouldn't even let someone else buy me one.\n\nThey started to change after I moved out of home. I noticed when an invite came for my little sister's 5th birthday party and it was a huge surprise because I never got a birthday party. In the 3 years since they have thrown birthday parties, gone all out for Christmas, they took them on vacation, which I never went on but my parents did.\n\nThen several months ago my parents realized I was doing well for myself with my art. They asked me to buy my siblings these big gifts for Christmas and I said no. My parents said they could only get the so much and I shrugged. These were easily 300-400USD gifts each that my parents wanted me to buy. And of course I was to give the gifts to my parents to give to my siblings.\n\nA few days ago then my parents asked me for money for stuff for my siblings and I said no. They said I was being very tight fisted with my money and to think of how much it would mean to my siblings. This is when I told them they don't get money off me to spoil my siblings the way they refused to spoil me. My parents said I was being petty and that I was punishing the wrong people.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1692444216, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vdoj2/aita_for_telling_my_parents_they_are_not_getting/", "score": 10879, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And as the pettiness goes - I would go to my parents and say that if anything happens to them you would rise your siblings the only way you know.

Parents deserve a break from some of those duties, and they need time to devote to maintaining and improving their romantic relationship. Sure they might co-parent really well, but that breaks down if they fall out of love. Taking time for just the two of them, away from the kids is important too. That's when they go to a vineyard, hit up Vegas, or relax at a couples spa.\n\nSo I'd never judge someone because they didn't bring their kids on a trip.

Even if you've done the things on your own as an adult, setting aside a specific occasion can help change your bad memories into good new ones.", "I would be NC, long before this", "She was denied ice cream, while dad played golf, mom bought shoes and make up and they went on holly days with out her. They had the money! And now they are guild tripping OP and using their other children as a weapon. Tell me you hate your child without telling me you hate your child.", "This very much. They only grew up as adults after they had their second child much later in life and their first had to suffer their own development. The parents were emotionally immature, probably still are because they\u2019re overcompensating now. Great books about that subject.", "Exactly!! We didn't grow up with much and my folks weren't perfect in how they handled that, but they made an effort to give us special moments (even if they were cheap or free). \n\nIt doesn't sound like OP's parents were being careful not to spoil them. It sounds like they didn't care that children need joy. Like borderline abusive attitudes. Very effed up.", "I don\u2019t think they know if they messed up with OP. They don\u2019t sound like they are that bright amongst other things.", "Yeah these sound like the kind of parents you cut off as soon as you\u2019re an adult. They don\u2019t deserve you.", "Did she really, though? She's financially independent right now. That's all we really know. Children raised with emotional neglect, and this post screams of it, do not grow up \"OK.\" They have markedly higher rates of depression, substance abuse, relationship failures, and job difficulty. OP's post and comments don't just detail parents that failed to provide anything more than the essentials, they detail a pattern of emotional neglect. This IS A FORM OF ABUSE. In many cases, this can actually be more psychologically damaging than some forms of physical abuse. It is difficult for the victim to even realize the abuse because they were \"provided the essentials.\" However, food and clothing does not make for a healthy and stable adult.", "Exactly.  YTA.  As in, You're The Author of this troll fiction.", "And the name of that neglected child? Albert Einstein!", ">If a child could get over it, I'm sure the parents are capable of accepting it without a tantrum.\n\nYou're assuming incorrectly.

The birthday parties is just cruel. That's so sad.", "Your parents suck. Obviously.\n\nAt least you found a way to channel your rage into some beautiful. So many people would have become bitter addicts.\n\nIt isn't surprising that your art is successful. Rage and crappy childhoods make for some amazing art.\n\nCongratulations on your success!", "I get this. I was told I was an expensive child because I needed hearing aids. I never got included on anything and always left behind. I\u2019m livid with my mom now knowing she chose to leave me with a known predator.", "I agree with you. \n\nI spent a long weekend on a trip with my friends and their 2 kids and ... It was a lot. I love those kids but yeah, there's only so many times I can answer the same questions. And why does it take 5 year olds 45 minutes to finish some toast ?! \n\nSo if parents take a weekend break and leave the kids behind, to recharge, that's fine of course.

I just wonder about possible cultural differences they might have not adjusted to until your siblings were born and the immigrant pressure on kids to feel like they are supposed to share their financial success. They sound awful regardless and I\u2019m sorry.", "They sound religious. This concept of \"giving you life\" and demanding worship and unconditional love in return, or else, sounds a lot like Christianity.", "You really should just directly tell them (possibly in writing) that you are hurt by how cheap they were with you as a child compared to how generous they are with your siblings and that given that history it's extremely rude of them to ask you to buy gifts for your siblings and that they need to stop.", "My pitchfork was out", "Any chance that you were a result of an affair?", "Right?! Like if anything it seems like adopted kids are much more wanted. You can have a bio kid by accident. Adoption is expensive with lots of hurdles to jump through. I don\u2019t think this line of questions adds anything to the discussion and is stigmatizing towards people who are adopted.", "Or even better talk to the siblings about how the parents are treating them. See if there are shared patterns.", "It really is amazing how unaware people are. I have to wonder if it's truly that they are unaware, or are they playing some diabolical game and keeping a poker face the entire time? \n\nMy brother called me once to wish me a happy birthday and invited me to lunch. I was surprised because he never does things like this.

Removing toxic people from your life isn't \"holding a grudge\", it's holding people accountable.

Working OT and holiday doubles was always worth it though, when I got to see how happy my kids were after a week of summer camp or a special trip with friends.\n\nMy parents didn't make a lot of money either when I was a kid, so I know what it's like to go without some of the basics, let alone the extras. My mom got a better job after I moved out, so my siblings had an easier time. I wouldn't have wished my childhood on them, although it makes me sad that I got so used to things never being an option that I can't really enjoy gift giving holidays. \n\nMy kids are all young adults now, and I still enjoy doing little surprises throughout the year for them. I can't imagine being a parent who didn't enjoy seeing their kid's face light up after an unexpected treat/surprise.", "that's fair! i did get diagnosed and medicated for the arthritis so the bad days aren't nearly as bad now (i can at least still go to work and otherwise function instead of sleeping 12+ hours a day). the parents i'm still working on.", "Makes me appreciate my parents all the more... the ice cream truck never once made it past my house without stopping, LOL.

Good times!", "As long as you were happy, that's all that matters in the end.", "Oh please. It's a fuckin ice cream treat. The point is the parents are pricks", "I.

Could wake up from sleep completely paralyzed due to pain and would have to call out for help.\n\nThe solution (for me) was to workout my back. Make it stronger. Weak muscles are prone to pain.  These days at 36 my back is fairly bullet proof.

No.  Just no.

In a way, I\u2019m thankful to have too little rather than too much- you lose sight of some really important shit when you have too much, in my experience.
