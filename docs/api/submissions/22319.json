The woman protects a coaster ffs. A coaster is meant to protect furniture from being damaged so she\u2019s protecting the thing that\u2019s protecting the furniture. Wtaf?! Seriously controlling issues there. \n\nBut I totally support her right to have her own rules and so do you. That she ignores them is a her problem not a you one. \n\nAnd the step dads comment is just gaslighting. That they beat a hasty retreat says they didn\u2019t enjoy being held to account. Well done and carry on, you\u2019ll soon have them well trained!!", "NTA. A lot of parents have massive amounts of trouble switching from \"we make the rules and you have to follow them\" to \"my kids have rules and I have to follow them\" mode. \n\nPick a friend of hers who has a similar rule and ask if she'd follow that person's house rules or disregard it and come up with an excuse to not bother.\n\nParents who can't recognise their children became adults and that they have the same right to have rules over their own house/kids/etc just end up creating tension. Basically enforce the rules till she can make the conceptual break of you as her child and you as a person, then it will get a whole lot easier.", "It\u2019s not about the floors, this is about control and your trying to feel like you have some and your mom refusing to allow it.", "Honestly soft YTA if your floors are legitimately dirty. Have you considered having \"house shoes\" of various sizes by the door as a compromise?", "This one depends on how dirty the floors are. Is there a picture? If they\u2019re visibly brown, then I would want to keep my shoes on too. You need the clean the floors, so it doesn\u2019t really matter if shoes are on.\n\nBut if the floors were minimally dirty, then these rules should be respected.", "Sort of sounds like you just wanted to play tit for tat.\n\nYTA.", "If you have a dirty floor but expect people to walk barefoot across it...

Have you been ill or are they just taking care of you because they are parents and you're their child?

Last night it was super rainy and my stepdad traipsed muddy water in to which me and my mum were both like \u201cthe floors!\u201d But then we wiped it up. My mums comment comes more from this history of me being more untidy than her and she\u2019s saying \u201cthe floors are probably dirtier than my shoes\u201d to argue against me asking her to remove my shoes.

I appreciate her help but sometimes I have to set the boundaries! Like she will come round for a cup of tea and be like do you want me to wash up for you? No mum..
