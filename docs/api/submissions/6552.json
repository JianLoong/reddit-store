They then said that I shouldn\u2019t be thinking about living with someone unless I have a ring on my finger. \n\nSince then, when I mention houses at work (I work in housing to it comes up A LOT), they keep making snide remarks about the situation, saying I\u2019m an emotionally abusive partner for not supporting him. I\u2019ve told them to back off, but they\u2019re not getting the hint.\n\nI spoke to my parents about it, and they\u2019ve said that whatever works for us works for us and that\u2019s that.

I put down 95% including the loan and dh put 5% of the total. So his name is on the deed for 5%. And it didn't go smoothly, first he wanted 50% to which my face gave him the hell no answer. Then he wanted 20% and I sent him walking. Fair is fair, he wants 50%, put the money where the mouth is. He only wanted to contribute 5%, he's lucky to get that much in shares.\n\nJust living rent free while you pay the loan is too much, trust someone who'se in this. You'll still be expected to contribute to the household expenses half way so that's a big financial burden. Yes the house will be yours... In 20 years or so, when you could have rented it out or done whatever you want with it. If his name is on the deed, you can't do anything without his approval or going through the courts. So don't!!!\n\nFor the coworkers, let them talk, they don't know anything anyway. Better not to speak to them on the subject anymore.", "NTA You need to learn not everyone's opinions are worth considering.  Your coworker is a misogynistic idiot and I am sure if the roles were reversed he would be telling your bf NOT to put your name on the house.

If you're the one paying for it & doing all the upkeep, that is *your* house. You don't owe your boyfriend anything, & putting his name on the deed means that if you break up in the future, he can potentially take *your* house from you or force you to sell it & split the proceeds with him.

It's ridiculous.", "NTA, there are a ton of legal considerations about whose name goes on the house, as you probably know if you're in housing. \n\nI mean this nicely but you probably need to stop caring about what other people think so much.

The house you pay with your money should remain yours, because you never know how your relationship will turn out later in time.

This allows for recognition that the two people have put in different amounts at the start.
