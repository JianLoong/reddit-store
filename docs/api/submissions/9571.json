I looked at him with a worried expression as he brushes my forearm and says: \"(His girl best friend's name) asked me to be her date for prom.\" I look at him even more confused because she has a bunch of friends that she could go with and she knows my boyfriend's already taken. So I say: \"I hope she'll find someone before prom.\" But he looks at me with guilty eyes and that's when I think I get the *important thing* he wanted to tell me. I ask him what was his answer, and he explains that he told her *yes*. Since my prom is next year, he could still be my date and it will still be perfect like I wanted. However, his best friend would be alone and sad, since they've known each other for a long time they know it would be only \"friendly\". I was fuming, I understand that he wants her to have a perfect prom, but I'm his girlfriend and it would be so awkward for him to be her date. I left the mall without him because I needed time to think. It hurts me because I try to understand each point of view, but it doesn't sound fair to me. We haven't talked since that conversation, he did try to reach me but I told him to have a conversation with his best friend first explaining that he wouldn't go with her, but he says it's unfair to her.

But if you don't talk to him what do you expect to happen? People can't read minds, and shutting down conversation is a good way to make something bad even worse.

Talk to him and tell him that him being her date makes you feel insecure and embarrassed since he\u2019s *your* boyfriend. \n\nTrying to manipulate him by giving him the silent treatment is counter-productive to what you want, childish, and could actually push him away from you.", "YTA. The 'silent treatment' is a recognized form of emotional abuse. It's just an immature punishment for something you don't like. What are you planning to do? Stay silent until he begs forgiveness? What if he doesn't? Be careful, this tactic can backfire on you. Who wants to date someone who doesn't speak to them or isn't mature enough to come to the table and work through their issues?", "Soft YTA because the silent treatment never works, and communication is always important. \n\nWhat he did sucked, and you need to talk to him about how much it hurts you. If he chooses her over you, then he\u2019s telling you his relationship with his friend is more important than his relationship with you. When it comes to big things like prom, the girlfriend should really come before the girl friend.", "YTA.  I agree with ok-thatsenough.  \"Silent treatment\" isn't a healthy way to negotiate in a relationship.  \n\nThe two of you need to talk about this.  Ideally you should have discussed it and come to agreement before he accepted the invitation from his best friend.  What he did wrong was not to check with you first.  I'm not going to say definitively that he shouldn't do it unless you give \"permission\", but I do think that the two of you should have been able to discuss the consequences of his choices, before he gave the other girl his answer.    \n\n\nNow that he's already agreed to his best friend/classmate's invitation, though, he needs to figure out what to do, and he needs to do that with full information.

(NOTE: You haven't told us any of the backstory, like did they talk about this years ago, either about this specific event or in a general \"if you ever need an escort I won't let you down\" sort of way, is she just getting over a breakup or a family crisis, etc).  It might be that he keeps his commitment to her despite your discomfort and the two of you learn to communicate better and not encounter such mismatched expectations next time.  It might be that he apologizes to her, and breaks the date explaining that he had not understood it mattered to you to be part of his big night.  It might be that you go with your boyfriend, she goes solo or with someone else, but he still poses for a photo with his best friend, dances with her sometimes, or whatever.    \n\n\nYou got in this mess because the two of you were acting from different assumptions, and not communicating about your expectations.  Don't make it all worse by refusing to speak to him until you get your way.", "YTA, Silent treatment is never the answer especially long term like this. You need to decide if you want to stay with him or not.\n\nTo be clear silent treatment is a weapon, weapons don't belong in relationships as you should not be wanting to harm the other.\n\nTaking time to think without talking for a short while (Few days max) is different as your trying to find where your feelings stand.\n\nIt's important to understand why you are doing what your doing, if you want to cause hurt (Intent) cause you got hurt it's always an AH thing even if understandable.", "NTA but you are not helping yourself by acting like a child.  \nTalk to him about why you are hurt by this, even if it seems obvious to you.", "NTA", "YTA for the ultimatum and the silent treatment.  Better to have an all-cards-on-the-table talk than an edict-filled pout.  If you can't trust him, then your relationship is doomed.  That said, he's kind of a jerk for not accounting for your feelings.  Perhaps there is some sort of compromise you could reach -- it seems like it is important that he takes his friend to Prom and not so important that he has the night of his life.  Maybe you could be involved in some way that would make it really special for him while still respecting the friendship he has with this other person.", "Ahhh young love. \n\nI hate calling an AH, but, YTA. The silent treatment is never an answer, as others have said. You\u2019ll be doing yourself a favor now by learning and practicing how to express your feelings.

Yes, there should have been a talk before big decisions, but you are in high school. This age is where you learn the communication skills to build healthy, trusting, relationships long run.
