I agreed to it at first but under the condition it was 3 weeks and even then I didn't want to go. Well weeks later she said the flight had to be booked for 5 weeks. She promised I would be living in a very comfortable place during the 5 weeks and not in some run down place.\n\nFew days later she starts talking about how she is going to help me find better doctors in China and better medication. I got very angry with this and said if she was going to do this, I will not join her. I was expecting to just meet relatives and go sight seeing, not go to a foreign country where I don't even speak the language for medical help.\n\nSo after we arrive, I am introduced to my uncle's place which was barely able to qualify not as a slum. It did not have a working toliet and had to manually change the water. There was obviously no AC and I cannot stand the heat as someone that has lived their whole life in Canada. The bed was as hard as a rock. My mom had lied to me in order to get me to come. Well soon after I was checked into a hotel instead so that issue was solved. However, I was beginning to lose trust in my mom and that's exactly what happens next.\n\nLiterally the next day my mom goes and tells all my relatives about my depression and mental health struggles. I do not know these relatives at all and was not comfortable sharing this with any of them. I haven't even told some of my close friends. My relatives all of a sudden start treating me very differently and asking if I was happy. They started getting very touchy with me which I absolutely hate. Then they started slandering Canadian health care and saying the medication is fraudulent. Everyone was attempting to brainwash me into thinking China is the best and will solve my mental health. I was then scheduled for a doctor's appointment and my mom took all my meds to show the doctor later. I had went over this with my mom before I agreed to come, that I was here to visit family and sightsee, not to try and find medical help.\n\nI was very upset with my mom after this and she has lie to me time after time and we had only been here for 3 days. This was too much for me so I threatened to contact the Canadian embassy basically for a SOS because I was trapped in a foreign country and feel I am at threat of being hurt because I have no idea what my mom will do next with me if she already completely betrayed my trust, and also I am a risk to myself because of my mental health. The Canadian embassy would likely find a way home for me. My mom didn't believe I can go back myself and basically thought it was a bluff and told me go ahead and try.\n\nAITA in this situation?", "created_utc": 1700848303, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/182xrlt/aita_for_threatening_to_fly_back_myself_after_a/", "score": 339, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Please DO fly home.", "I'm an adult but I say trapped because 1, my mom is withholding my passport from me, and 2, I may not necessarily have the money currently to book a flight. Also I can't read and can barely speak Chinese. I wouldn't know how to properly book a flight back.\n\nI only have nationality in Canada. I have never even stepped foot outside Canada until this.", "This is a terrifying possibility. OP sounds so helpless, her mother has clearly kept her on such a short leash.", "> my mom is withholding my passport from me\n\nThat is very illegal. The passport is the property of the Canadian government and they will take this very seriously.\n\nCall  the Embassy NOW. As someone else said, you are in genuine danger of being locked up in a mental hospital with no chance of escape.  Your mother is dangerous and insane and you need to run. The Embassy should be able to get you a temporary travel document and will arrange a ticket (you will probably have to pay them back eventually but that's not a priority right now).  The Embassy might even contact the local Chinese police and have them take the passport back, but I wouldn't know. They know best.\n\nGood luck.", "> my mom is withholding my passport from me\n\nThis is not a joke. At the very least you need to call the embassy immediately. Talk with someone. Let them know your situation. Make sure they know you\u2019re in the country. This is very, very important\n\n> I wouldn't know how to properly book a flight back.\n\nThe same way you book a flight there. Google flights and book with a credit card.\n\nBut if you are really desperate you can just go to the airport and walk up to the Air Canada desk.

Going to the embassy and saying \u201cI\u2019m a Canadian Citizen, my mother has stolen my passport and seized my money\u201d *will* get you back to Canada.

Right now.  This is not safe. Go to the embassy so they can help you.\n\nCall people at home to let them know you are worried.

If it costs tell them to put it on the card used to book the flight.  If that doesn't work go to your embassy.  Explain you've had your passport taken from you and you need help getting back home.  For your own safety do whichever is quicker.  If you do go to the embassy go when you won't be observed leaving, even if it's the middle of the night.
