{"id": 23107, "submission_id": "15972zg", "title": "AITA for abandoning my friend's boyfriend after he jumped out of my car to confront a stranger", "selftext": "My (26F) friend's (25F) boyfriend (29M) is a really friendly guy, we get on pretty well but he has an incredibly short fuse and even the smallest thing can send him from chilled to rage.\n\nI was driving the three of us back to their house and stopped at a junction waiting to pull out. As a gap appeared and I started to move forward a jogger ran across the front of the car and I had to stamp on the brakes to avoid hitting him. He gestured at me and shouted something along the lines of, \"watch where you're fucking going,\" and continued running.\n\nMy friend's boyfriend jumped out of the car and started shouting at this guy. The jogger who was now about 20 metres down the road stopped and turned around and shouted something back that I didn't hear but was apparently along the lines of, \"chill out mate.\"\n\nMy friend's boyfriend then ran after this guy and continued shouting at him. At this point I'd been sat stationery at the junction and the car behind started beeping. There was nowhere to go but pull out onto the road and drive off and it was a fairly busy road so I wasn't keen on pulling to the side and stopping. I was also pretty pissed off at this point as my friend's boyfriend has a history of ruining social occasions by getting unnecessarily angry, and I thought, \"fuck it, if you want to run off and shout at a random guy then that's your decision.\" We were only around a 10 minute walk away from their house so I felt he could make his own way back pretty easily. I said this to my friend who didn't respond at first, but after asking if she was OK she said yes and we drove back to her house.\n\nWhen he got back he was still angry but not raging. More than anything he felt \"let down.\" He asked why I drove off without him and I explained it was because he ran off and I had nowhere to stop and didn't know if he even wanted to get back into the car at that point. He said fine, but he was just sticking up for me and was annoyed that I'd abandoned him while he was doing so. I said I couldn't care less what the jogger had said and I didn't ask or need him to stick up for me. He responded by saying he'd expect me to do the same if I cared about someone and asked what I would have done if it was my friend/his girlfriend driving. I said I wouldn't react like he did. He then turned to her and asked her what she thought about me admitting I wouldn't have stood up for her and she said she didn't want to be dragged into this and left the room. I followed her and he went off upstairs.\n\nI don't feel great about driving off but at the same time I'm glad I did because he regularly goes off like this and creates a bad atmosphere which ruins hanging out or going to events together, and I'm glad he faced some repercussions for it. But he believes I let him down by driving off while he was sticking up for me. He sees what he did as a good thing and is hurt that I don't see it that way.\n\nAITA for driving off?", "created_utc": 1690288031, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15972zg/aita_for_abandoning_my_friends_boyfriend_after_he/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A \u201cshort fuse\u201d is actually a very dangerous mentality to have and should not be minimized or excused. I wouldn\u2019t want someone like that in my life and certainly would not support their behavior. The last thing you want is to get yourself mixed up in a violent altercation especially over something small", "First, from your description, the jogger absolutely had the right of way. The jogger yelling at you was most likely just self-protective. Drivers actually do need to watch where they're going.\n\nThis makes this friend's boyfriend an even bigger AH for getting out of a car and confronting someone. (He would have been an AH anyway for doing that.) It sounds like he's a general hot-headed AH who can't control his temper, and that's not \"a friendly guy\" at all!\n\nNTA for driving off. In fact, I'd have nothing more to do with him. Next time he could decide he's angry at you.", "NTA sounds like your friend\u2019s boyfriend needs anger management therapy", "NTA. I'd expect better behaviour from a golden retriever with rabies tbh.  \nPerplexed he doesn't understand his behaviour is wrong.  \nAnd i'd question being friends with somebody who expects me to aggressively chase down a jogger for jaywalking.  \n\n\nAnd yeah. I'd drive off too, not my business or responsibility.", "NTA. I am very, very disturbed he does not even recognize what he did was a problem. If anything I think you were too easy on him.", "NTA, if he wants to grab every moment in life to confront someone he can carry himself home. Also a nice lesson of \"actions have consequences\" you did not ask to be defended on your behalf", "NTA   \nHe left you in an uncomfortable situation with nowhere safe to pull over. Driving off was the right decision, especially considering you didn't know if he would be coming back to the car and their house was a short walk away.\n\nIt sounds like he has a history of flying off the handle. You never know how the recipient   \nof these rage fits will respond, which makes this an extremely dangerous habit not just for him but for those around him. He clearly doesn't see anything wrong, and thinks it was noble for him to \"stick up\" for you in this way. That is such a dangerous mindset - rage should never be the answer and will only escalate situations. Additionally, it seems like he was trying to turn his girlfriend against you when he tried dragging her into it - that seemed very manipulative. The boyfriend needs to seek therapy IMO.", "NTA. He's full of it.  He wasn't sticking up for you.  He could not have cared less about you.  What did he do when he caught up to the jogger?  Did he beat him up?", "OP, please keep an eye on your friend. She might need your support to leave this guy one day. His anger management issues could easily bleed over into how he treats her.", "NTA. He's going to get himself killed if he carries on like that, I wouldn't go anywhere near him", "NTA. You were in a difficult position with no safe place to stop, and his choice to confront a stranger escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nDriving off was a reasonable decision to remove yourself from a potentially dangerous and confrontational situation. It's not your responsibility to support or condone his actions when they create a negative and aggressive atmosphere.\r  \n\r  \nNOTE: Encourage him to find healthier ways to cope with frustration and anger.", "NTA. I would never let this guy back in my car.   Oh, and your friend \"not wanting to get in the middle of this\" is already RIGHT SMACK IN THE MIDDLE of this, as she is the entire cause of having this ... walking, talking, living, breathing felony... in your life.", "Lol is your friend dating Dax Shepard?  Nta", "NTA - that's actually a great response, tbh. he needs to learn his lesson as well as get some therapy or something.  His short fuse isn't your problem but he is inadvertently involving you when he assaults people....I wouldn't want to be around there either.", "nta, dude sounds fuckin psycho. Who does that shit?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe friend's bf is an AH. He was not sticking up for you, he was endangering you all and causing an unnecessary scene. NEVER let him enter your car again.", "He is a hothead. NTA.", "nta that guy needs anger management", "NTA. Jumping out of a car to chase down a jogger who was almost certainly in the right isn't a friendly guy with a short fuse, that's an anger issue verging on actual mental illness. \n\nSeparately, Y T A for not looking for pedestrians. Believe it or not, people exist outside of cars, and sometimes they walk along sidewalks and through intersections. You need to pay attention to them, not just cars.", "NTA...Pedestrians have the right of way, in most jurisdictions. Your \"friend\" is like those tiny little dogs that are always going after anything they put eyes on. He is weak and immature. He is \"white knighting\" it, a form of simping, in order to look strong in you and his GF's eyes. He has definite insecurity's and is basically a weak man. You never implied, nor demonstrated you were bothered by the jogger to the point direct action was needed. He gaslights you by stating he would expect the same from you! He expects \\*you\\* to be a weak ass moron and go chasing after someone, for some perceived slight, in absence of any real and direct threat. Tell you what: That is a good way to get shot. It happens. Advise your GF to broom his ass, quick. She was smart: she stayed out of it. NTA either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
