As a gap appeared and I started to move forward a jogger ran across the front of the car and I had to stamp on the brakes to avoid hitting him. He gestured at me and shouted something along the lines of, \"watch where you're fucking going,\" and continued running.\n\nMy friend's boyfriend jumped out of the car and started shouting at this guy. The jogger who was now about 20 metres down the road stopped and turned around and shouted something back that I didn't hear but was apparently along the lines of, \"chill out mate.\"\n\nMy friend's boyfriend then ran after this guy and continued shouting at him. At this point I'd been sat stationery at the junction and the car behind started beeping. There was nowhere to go but pull out onto the road and drive off and it was a fairly busy road so I wasn't keen on pulling to the side and stopping. I was also pretty pissed off at this point as my friend's boyfriend has a history of ruining social occasions by getting unnecessarily angry, and I thought, \"fuck it, if you want to run off and shout at a random guy then that's your decision.\" We were only around a 10 minute walk away from their house so I felt he could make his own way back pretty easily. I said this to my friend who didn't respond at first, but after asking if she was OK she said yes and we drove back to her house.\n\nWhen he got back he was still angry but not raging. More than anything he felt \"let down.\" He asked why I drove off without him and I explained it was because he ran off and I had nowhere to stop and didn't know if he even wanted to get back into the car at that point. He said fine, but he was just sticking up for me and was annoyed that I'd abandoned him while he was doing so. I said I couldn't care less what the jogger had said and I didn't ask or need him to stick up for me. He responded by saying he'd expect me to do the same if I cared about someone and asked what I would have done if it was my friend/his girlfriend driving. I said I wouldn't react like he did. He then turned to her and asked her what she thought about me admitting I wouldn't have stood up for her and she said she didn't want to be dragged into this and left the room. I followed her and he went off upstairs.\n\nI don't feel great about driving off but at the same time I'm glad I did because he regularly goes off like this and creates a bad atmosphere which ruins hanging out or going to events together, and I'm glad he faced some repercussions for it. But he believes I let him down by driving off while he was sticking up for me. He sees what he did as a good thing and is hurt that I don't see it that way.\n\nAITA for driving off?", "created_utc": 1690288031, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15972zg/aita_for_abandoning_my_friends_boyfriend_after_he/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You never know how the recipient   \nof these rage fits will respond, which makes this an extremely dangerous habit not just for him but for those around him. He clearly doesn't see anything wrong, and thinks it was noble for him to \"stick up\" for you in this way. That is such a dangerous mindset - rage should never be the answer and will only escalate situations. Additionally, it seems like he was trying to turn his girlfriend against you when he tried dragging her into it - that seemed very manipulative. The boyfriend needs to seek therapy IMO.", "NTA.

You were in a difficult position with no safe place to stop, and his choice to confront a stranger escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nDriving off was a reasonable decision to remove yourself from a potentially dangerous and confrontational situation.

A short fuse can lead to a really dangerous situation. This does not seem like a stable person. Be careful op.", "To clear up the pedestrian issue, I'm in the UK where the law has recently changed. The jogger did have the right of way, but this new law is basically ignored by 99% of drivers and 99% of pedestrians still give way to cars. When I'm jogging I always run behind cars at junctions for exactly this reason, never infront. But technically he had the right of way but I just didn't expect him to run right across the front of my car as I was pulling out.", "Why do you assume the jogger had right of way?  It sounds dad like he was running between two cars in line for a light.  He should be running in the crosswalk.  Otherwise, what he is doing is unlawful.", "The fact that she described him as a \u201cfriendly\u201d guy makes me think she isn\u2019t the best one to keep an eye on her friend. Either way he sounds like someone who takes everything personally and has an ego to \u201cprotect\u201d. Not the kind of person I want to hang around romantically or not.", "I am worried about this.

I mentioned in another comment that the right of way law has recently changed in the UK which has caused a lot of confusion.", "Absolutely is the wrong word but it is still highly likely that the pedestrian had the right of way. \n\nIt reads to me like they are at an intersection, either a three way or four way, and were waiting for a gap in oncoming traffic so they could out and merge by making a right turn. \n\nWhich means either a stop sign, a yield, or a red light.  All of those give pedestrians right of way... At least where I live. \n\nMy guess is she was looking left at the traffic for an opportunity to pull out and when one arose she did not check right.", "Depends.

Just yesterday I had a car drive right in front of me because they were watching another pedestrian clear their lane (and making sure the child with them didn\u2019t turn around and run in front of them because kids are dumb) and didn\u2019t notice me approaching, walking the same direction but behind these folks. But I could tell they weren\u2019t paying attention so I was walking slowly and didn\u2019t enter the lane, if you walk a lot you get used to clocking whether a stopped or slow moving driver is aware you\u2019re there or focused on other hazards", "By \"friendly\" I meant he's the type of person who will hit it off with anyone. He's the type of person who makes new friends instantly, and loves hitting up conversations with strangers.

I just meant in this context that it's not safe to expect a 26 year old woman to do that. As in the boyfriend, he wasn't thinking about that while he's saying she would be a bad friend for not sticking up for them. I just spoke in this specific situation cause that's what the post is about.", "Where I live pedestrians always have the right of way. I wish more of them would pay attention to their surroundings because being right legally won't make them less dead when they step out into busy traffic without looking but legally speaking they're not breaking the law.", "In New Jersey, NO ONE outside of the car one is driving has the right of way.  Not people turning right, not pedestrians, and not the driver who actually has the right of way", "Thank you for taking the time to reply to me. The post I replied to is solid advice. That behavior can only be \u201ccontrolled\u201d for so long until either your friend or someone close to her does something that sets him off.

It's not just our fucking terrible attitudes: it's the jug handles.\n\nNew Jersey is a small state which has more miles of boardwalk than any other state, including California.  It's often used as a pass thru to both the beach and New York City.  We have a TON of traffic from folks who are not used to jug handles, so we have a ton of folks darting from the left lane to the right lane in 50 yards doing 55MPH.

What if you pulled around the corner, he eventually comes back to the car and you all head home, and later the police show up at your place because the jogger called them after being threatened. Or because he beat the shit out of someone. It's a huge liability to be around people like this. They will drag you into wild, dangerous situations in the blink of an eye, situations you have no ability to make good decisions during because you never in your life considered they would happen to you. And by that point it's too late.\n\nPersonally I would not hang around this person anymore. And be honest with your friend. I used to hang around people like this, and I never thought that much of it because everyone else in the friend group just tolerated it, and if you brought it up they'd just go, \"....Yeah....\" and not look you in the eye. Everyone was just passively tolerating their behavior. It wasn't until I talked to people outside the friend group about the behavior that I got a reality check and decided to get out of there, and it was a good idea because soon enough the police WERE involved.
