You did what needed to be done.  2 years of a lie... kids are sharper than that, especially as they continue to grow.  No good can come of that.\n\nUnquestionably your brother does not look like he's coping at all.  I can feel for the guy, but he was wrong from the start and I'd really raise an eyebrow at your friend's responses more than anyone.  They're more detached and can't see how messed up it is to tell kids that they're mum is still alive when she's not.  It'll never not hurt but it's not something that should be delayed because the longer the delay, the worse it is going to be.\n\nYou did the right thing, I hope your brother can find his way out of this downward spiral.  He seems happy to do it solo but clearly that's not working.", "NTA. TWO YEARS?! These girls deserve to know, grieve and move on. \n\nTheir dad has abandoned and lied by omission for two whole years. He's relinquished all rights to them by this point. By this point, they're barely his daughter's anymore. You're their responsible adult. You can and should make these decisions as he's not stepping up and has all but relinquished his parental rights. \n\nYou can't only see your children 12 days/weekends in 2 years and still claim you know what's best for them.\n\nYou might want to seriously consider speaking to a lawyer about your legal rights regarding your nieces.", "NTA at all, 2 years!!?? That isn't right at all. Someone had to do something, I'm sorry it had to be you, but it had to be done. Your brother needs some help though and I hope he gets it. \n\nNow to be a bit harsh here, your brother saying \"It's not your place\" is absolutely crazy in this context. He has effectively given up his kids at this point, and offers no financial assistance. He should really think about what his \"place\" is in this situation because it certainly isn't being any type of father.", "NTA as your nieces needed to be told their mother was dead when it occurred - in language that they could understand.\n\nMy brother died when my niece was five and she was told. Obviously she didn't have a sophisticated understanding at that age but she knew what was appropriate for her development stage and she staged her own memorial service for her father.\n\nThe girls are probably undergoing worse trauma from not being told the truth for the past 2 years and wondering why they can't see their mother and imagining all kinds of things.", "2 years?!?! i get a day or 2. but no, 2 years is 2 years too long.\n\nYour brother needs to deal with his grief but by avoiding telling the kids about it meant that you guys haven't been able to really help them. Instead they've been grieving the lost opportunity to be with mom while she's sick and now have to grieve her all over again. They should have been able to do that 2 years ago.\n\nI imagine your brother felt that if he never told the kids, it would never really make it true. And that's not how it works. And more importantly not telling the kids was incredibly unhealthy for them.\n\nIt sounds like you and your family have been doing all of the right things- and getting them the support that they need.\n\nHopefully some day, your brother will do the same for himself.\n\nNTA", "WHAT? TWO years after she died? Holy shit. That was egregious. \n\nHe is barely in their lives, he isn't dealing with his own grief and he's projecting that onto them (they'll never be the same, ruined happiness). It sounds like he is in serious need for intensive therapy.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  He needs mental help. \n\nMy husband died when our daughter was 5. I prepared her for it and told her within minutes.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother is off his rocker to think that withholding the fact that their mother was dead, *for two years*, is in any way reasonable. He's abandoned his parental role, but expects you to deal with his daughter's wanting to see their mother?!! Just ... no. At some point, they're going to find out when their mother died and that they were lied to for 2 years (longer, if your brother had his way).", "NTA. I would find waiting even just a couple days to be crazy, but 2 effing years?! Even if they're two young to be now, they're going to resent him for this.", "Thank god these two kids had you and your family to support them.\n\n100% NTA", "NTA at all. There are child-appropriate ways to approach death, and lying to them for years about it is not one of them. You\u2019ve gone above and beyond to be a great aunt to those kids.", "Given the length of time, NTA.\n\nSince he's shown no effort to get therapy or grief counseling, and is not able to provide for his children, you should also look into getting legal guardianship.\n\nIt's been too long. Those poor babies are gonna be even more upset finding out who their whole family has been lying to them for TWO years! They're old enough to realize it ain't adding up.", "Info: did she died 2 years ago? How old are the kids right now?", "NTA.\n\nAs everyone else has said, 2 years is way too long for those girls to not know their mother is dead. I genuinely feel sorry for your brother, as it\u2019s his wife and the mother of his children we\u2019re talking about. But his grieving has likely already caused significant psychological damage to his daughters. I\u2019m just glad he and his wife agreed to let you and your fianc\u00e9 take in the girls, because I wouldn\u2019t have trusted him to be mentally well enough to help them.\n\nAnd of course, his (questionable) decision to keep himself away from everyone by moving over an hour\u2019s drive away, barely visit his children, and outright refuse therapy shows that he was in no condition to be present for his daughters. Hell, I wouldn\u2019t even call what he did over the past two years \u201cparenting\u201d to begin with, you, your fianc\u00e9, and the rest of your family were the ones doing the real work of taking care of the girls.\n\nI also applaud you for setting up a support system beforehand to ensure telling them about their mother\u2019s passing would be as painless as possible.", "THEY DONT KNOW THEIR MOM IS DEAD\n\nHoly shit NTA \n\nPlease god tell them", "NTA your brother needs serious help", "NTA,\n\nThat's a really tough situation and I'm SO sorry for everyone in this story. But I don't think you're the AH at all. You're essentially full time carers for your brother's children. He hasn't been able to cope, unfortunately hadn't engaged nor presented a plan for how or when to share the news with the girls. \n\nEventually the girls were going to find out and if they realise the information was kept from them for years and years then they may have developed trust issues. Getting professional help and doing what was best for them was your priority. Of course getting your brother on board would have been best but I'm guessing that is why you waited so long before taking this step.", "NTA, he's spiraling mentally from grief and isn't making clearheaded decisions.", "NTA. At first I was thinking yes you\u2019re but then after reading your post I changed my mind. You aren\u2019t an AH. You are an amazing aunt and sister. You have stepped up when your brother has abandoned them.", "NTA. I expected to give a different judgment before I read the post. This is a *really* unique and difficult situation you\u2019re all in. \n\nAs it stands now, you are parenting your nieces. Their father isn\u2019t. I sympathize for your brother and I understand he is going through something unbelievably difficult.. but I also don\u2019t think he\u2019s in a position where he can get upset with you for telling his children the truth about their mother. Continuing with the lie would have done them more harm than good. You are taking over his responsibilities at this point and you are doing what needs to be done. \n\nI hope your brother gets himself some professional help - it\u2019s not even a question at this point, he needs it. I\u2019m glad your nieces have you in their lives. You\u2019re doing a good job managing a really difficult and impossible situation.", "OMG NTA. I did not expect the amount of time involved. If it had been a few hours or even a few days, I would think differently, but TWO YEARS.\n\nThe kids have probably been feeling abandoned and confused that whole time. And I agree that they will never be the same, but you cannot put people in stasis! They are two years older than they were - they are guaranteed to be not the same. I am shocked that your brother has friends who say you're AH here, as opposed to friends who pointed out that he was depriving his daughters of a chance to say goodbye, to know what was happening, and to grieve in the moment with their family around them. No, it wasn't your place to tell the girls their mom had died - it was their dad's - but he has failed to share that very important information for two years now. This was an incredibly harmful secret. You couldn't keep it.\n\nYou're doing the best you can in an incredibly strange and messed up situation.", "NTA - I had a different answer before I read the whole post. It's a tough situation but you did they right thing, if it were left to your brother he probably would've put it off until both girls were double digits. He seems to have checked out as a parent and if the girls are happy (as can be) and healthy, perhaps your brother should sign over his rights because it seems like he isn't fit to be a parent. I only say this because it has been 2 years and if he isn't seeking help so that he can be well enough to support his kids, thats a huge red flag.", "What the f did I just read? You let this go on your two years? NTA for finally telling them but everyone here including you has done these kids a major disservice to their mental health. WOW", "Nta. But holy shiet. You did the right thing. And it looks like you did your research and got all the support in place before you told them. That's thoughtful on your part and not something you took lightly.", "NTA...this is messy! As their guardian, you were doing what is right by them. This lie serves no purpose and could have been causing further harm. They will eventually know that their mother died and their father lied to them for two years, while essentially abandoning them. \n\nI sincerely hope you all can find a way to navigate this and bring the family back together. Your brother undeniably needs to get some help.", "NTA\n\nTwo years?! That's a third of one of their lives and a quarter of the other's, and that doesn't take into account how much they'd not have remembered during their first few years. How many years did he think was acceptable? Did he want them to have lived the majority of their lives under the lie that they'd one day see their mother again?\n\nSome day they're going to wonder what her body must have looked like on the day that they were finally told, and what it would have looked like when their father would finally have told them. They never even got the chance to say goodbye, their father withheld that from them.\n\nMaybe you should have told them earlier, but it's more important that you *did* tell them, that you decided *not* to continue the lie, and that you did your best to prepare for the emotional fallout.\n\nYour brother also sounds like he's on a dark path and needs professional help.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nThe idea that numerous adults would think lying to these children for two years was the right way to handle their mother's death, unbelievable.

They have 3 girls, who were 12, 9 and 6 when she died.  The girls were always told what was happening in a way they could understand, they were never lied to and nothing was ever covered up.  My mum was our guide in this, her dad died when she was 4 and she told us that not being told things made it worse, for years she thought her dad didn't love her anymore and that's why she didn't see him, and that they went from a happy house to a sad house overnight and she never knew why, or why all the adults would whisper or send her and her siblings out of the room to talk.  She eventually got bereavement counselling for it in her late 50s; that's how long it stayed with her and hurt her, so when my SIL was first diagnosed my mum said she wouldn't step on brother and sil's toes, but from her experience her advice would be to tell them what was going on.  \n\nThe girls are doing really well now.

Can you imagine trusting people when your own family would lie to you about something like this? Someone died. That someone was their mother.

I would also suggest petitioning the court for legal full time guardianship of these kids!! You\u2019ve been raising them for the last 2 years and your brother is clearly not stable enough to do it on his own. I hope your family can also talk him into grief counseling for himself.

They couldn't have landed in a better place than with you.\n\nYour brother was going to damage them so badly. He is angry because his way of dealing with this has been denial and avoidance. And he's an adult, if that's what he needs, then so be it. But doing that to his kids . . . he would have broken them, and then they REALLY wouldn't have been the same.

I suggested my parents or one of us siblings doing it but he didn\u2019t want that either. We\u2019d remind him every single month or tell him every time they mentioned missing their mom but he\u2019d have an excuse & would say he\u2019d do it next week or next month which is why after respecting his wishes for so long I decided it was time to tell them without his permission. It\u2019s also been extremely hard watching my brother (who was literally the kindest person, greatest father / husband & a ray of sunshine in our lives go into a very dark place\u2026  hence why we kept respecting his wishes. (I know that doesn\u2019t justify it but it was very difficult)", "This. While OP had the best intentions, she, along with every other adult in these girls' lives, knowingly participated in a lie. For two years these girls believed their mother was still alive and kept asking for her. Yes, OP did the right thing in the end, because her brother would likely have never told his daughters they didn't have a mother anymore and they would have eventually found out on their own, which would have been a lot worse. But still, there was no reason to let it go on as long as it did.", "Why does OP and the family suck as well? Because they went along with the dad\u2019s misguided wishes for two full years?", "Right? ESH. All those adults not looking out for those poor children!", "It\u2019s OP raising the kids, their father has isolated himself from his children for two years since their mother died. I think you\u2019ve misunderstood the post", "So you would be cool if they reached an age where the oldest graduated 8th grade and asked if mom could come to the graduation or at least facetime maybe and the response was 'Oh no, she can't to that.  Your mother died 6 years ago'  Seriously, two years is insane.  The mental damage that could have been done and that will still be done as they grow older and realize what happened is significant.  They should have been told the day of and grieved as a family.", "You\u2019re missing the point. It\u2019s been 2 YEARS since their mother died. The father has essentially been lying to them for the sake of not having to deal with it. Not to mention he, for all intents and purposes, gave OP guardianship and does nothing to financially compensate OP for her taking in his children. I have no doubt OPs brother would have continued lying about their mother\u2019s death for several more years. And he is hurting his children in a sense. He\u2019s hurting them by not telling the truth. They still thought their mother was alive and in the hospital for about 2 years after she passed, they wanted to visit her and couldn\u2019t understand why they hadn\u2019t been able to for that long. All because their father didn\u2019t get himself the help HE needed to grieve. OP went the extra mile to make sure her nieces had a proper support system in place BEFORE telling them. Do you think her brother would have done that?", "He's not raising the kids, he left them with his sister for years and shows up once every 2 months, and gives them no financial support. If it's not \"her place\" to do it then who's is it? Certainly not this  guy since he's effectively given up the kids and isolated himself. Dealing with grief sucks but it doesn't excuse abandoning your kids and then getting mad at the person raising them for telling them the truth after 2 fucking years. This dude needs to get his shit together, or just let his sister adopt them and get it over with.", ">As long as he\u2019s not hurting them\n\nHe is causing them unfathomable damage. This is horrific.", "Reread the post, OP has been raising them.", "I would argue that, by not telling them their mother had died, and pretending she was just in the hospital and not communicating, their dad *was* hurting the girls. Either they think their mom is comatose, which is its own kind of trauma, or they think their mom doesn't care about them - if she cared, she would call, facetime, sign birthday cards, thank them for their Mothers' Day gifts, ask about events in their lives. They've probably been questioning that for most of two years now, which is a recipe for major, lifelong emotional problems. \n\nIt is extremely rare that anyone is \"ready\" to lose someone they love, but people of all ages nonetheless need to know. Grief is painful. I would 1000x rather grieve people I love than go on believing that people I love are ignoring me, and then learn that I have been lied to by people I should have been able to trust. \n\nThe dad in this case has seriously psychologically injured his daughters, and people doing the work of caring for them were absolutely correct to limit that injury, and would have been correct to do so earlier.", "If two years haven't been long enough just exactly when do you think the brother is going to feel it has been long enough? How is it not hurting them when they are under the impression their mother doesn't want to even speak to them on the phone?", "Two years though? That's emotioanl abuse.", "Holy Molly, NTA. The damage caused for hiding something like this is absurd.", "The worst part is everyone was a part of it! That\u2019s conspiracy level crap they did to little kids. I get a month or two (not really they should have been told when it happened) but two freaking years. If they don\u2019t have major trust issues it will be a miracle. How did nobody involved step in and say enough is enough?", "Giving dad some time to grieve is understandable, but after at least the first YEAR - and arguably before then - it's apparent that it's been too long and everyone knows their mother isn't coming back. To let two years pass and THEN start to wonder if you should say something? Yes, that makes ESH\n\nThese kids are both arguably old enough to be able to remember their mom and this is all horrifying.", "I\u2019m guessing they think ESH because instead of telling them before about their mom, they waited for 2 years and waited for their dad to tell them.", "But that\u2019s not what op was asking. 100% her brother needs help but she still shouldn\u2019t have told the kids against his wishes. All that did was push him further away and make it harder for family to get to the kids.", "Please show where I said that.", "Yeah OP\u2019s family has really dug themselves into a hole here. I have no idea how this should be handled at this point.", "I feel like a single digit number of days should have been the limit. Certainly before the funeral.", "Push him further away from what. he's an absentee father already. Moved one hour away. Barely see his daughters. Doesnt provide financial support. And this has been going on for 2 years. That's not a father. He abandoned them. Fuck out of here.", "Sounds like the kids are still in OP's care.", "\"It's not up to you to decide when they are ready to know.  You are not their parent\"\n\nIt has already been 2 years, OP is their parent right now as she has been taking care of them for 2 years.  Dad is living an hour away and sees them once every other month and is showing no signs of trying to work to the point of telling them.  How long is it ok to keep up the charade?", "Therapy. Lots of professional therapy.", "So uh, I'm actually going to say YTA for letting this go on for two years.  Holy wow.  I guess from AITA rules, the father needs a judgement too, so we'll say ESH but woof.  You owe those girls a huuuuge apology along with a conversation about how sometimes adults make the wrong choices.  Hopefully with all the support you have involved, this has already been handled.\n\nTo be clear, even though I'm judging YTA for letting this go for \\*two years\\*, props for eventually telling them, and props for stepping up and caring for them after they lost both parents.  Because make no mistake, they lost their dad too.\n\nAssuming you're up to/plan to keep the girls, please talk to a lawyer if you haven't already to make sure all your legal ducks are in a row for whenever their father decides he wants to play dad again.  Preferably with an option to come after their dad for child support if he makes things difficult.", "NTA\n\nIt is completely unacceptable to not tell them that their mother was dead.\n\nYou made the right decision.", "NTA about finally telling them.  Through wow I want to vote E-S-H because two years. But you got teacher and therapist involved and had to deal with choosing between defying their father and waiting for your own firm guardianship\n\nI thought it was going to be a few hours and days but two years? Those poor kids. Wow are they going to have trust issues; waiting for their mom to come home. \n\nAnd your brother was never going to do it after two years. He meant it he was playing denial and got to hide from reality with his daughters. He probably kept telling them staying with aunt and uncle as I am focusing on your mom. When she\u2019s out then we can be a family. Urg", "NTA These girls were being done a terrible disservice. Now they can move forward in dealing with their grief. Until then they were in an emotional holding pattern of possibly false hope. Kudos for how you handled finally telling them.  Their dad\u2019s friends should stay out of this.", "NTA. I'll say it again in every thread where it is relevant:\n\nGrief is no excuse to treat people like shit. He was their father. They needed him, and the healthy thing would have been for all of them to grieve together. He decided to be a selfish asshole and live in denial & now he's just mad that someone loves those kids enough to pop his fantasy bubble.\n\nLosing your person is the most terrible that can happen, and he made sure those kids lost both of theirs.\n\nGood for you for stepping up and making sure they get a real childhood.", "NTA, you may want to prep the kids for dad coming around even less. It might be a long time before he visits, since his daughters knowing completely destroys the delusional world he would create with his visits.", "NTA. It wasn't and shouldn't have been your place to tell them but your brother made it your place.", "NTA, everyone that is saying you guys should have said something sooner to the girls is wrong. Suppose you would have said something and your brother did not get them any therapy or any help that they need and they will be a hot mess for real. Also, your brother may have just not let you have them and imagine what will be happening with them now and your brother being angry about y\u2019all telling them and not letting y\u2019all see the girls. With his mindset, you guys made his girls have grief. You should be so proud of yourself, your husband and your family because you have stepped up in a way that if y\u2019all had told them earlier without your brothers permission because they were still living with him everything that you put in place now for them to receive would not have been there. Your brother would\u2019ve isolated himself and the girls away from all of you guys. Saying the same thing that you ruined their happiness, and that they will be unhappy for the rest of their life. Hopefully your brother gets the help he needs and some better friends.", "Wtf 2 years!?!?! Every single person involved in lying to those kids are assholes!", "NTA\n\nHe wasn\u2019t doing this (not telling them) for them, he was being selfish and doing it for him bc he didn\u2019t want to break the news to them. He would have to really face the reality, he would have to work on his grief, he would have to comfort and be there for his children during THEIR grief . \n\nYou did the right thing.

Most likely, They thought their mum was sick and not wanting to see them this entire time.", "NTA", "Oh god, ESH SO HARD\n\nYes, your brother is clearly the bigger AH here. He\u2019s effectively abandoned his children in their greatest time of need and you\u2019ve done an amazing thing by stepping up! But good god, I could not imagine lying to children about their mother being alive for almost TWO YEARS. These kids are going to need therapy for the rest of their lives, not only because their mom died while they were young, but because every single trusted adult in their life lied to them and told them they still had a mom. I can\u2019t imagine the betrayal they must feel. In their eyes, they\u2019ve been denied seeing or hearing from their mother for two years now, which I\u2019m sure had it\u2019s own deluge of negative feelings. But now they know everyone was a liar. \n\nThey missed any real opportunity to properly say goodbye. They didn\u2019t even get to go to the funeral, which is shameful. \n\nI know you were all put in a tough position by the parent not telling them himself, but someone should\u2019ve stepped in and ripped the bandaid long ago. It\u2019s good that the kids are in therapy now.

Be aware that you made a bed of nails that you may have to lie on depending on if they remember how you all let them down. When someone dies it is never harmless to let anyone think they are still alive. This caused so much pain they never should have felt as you told them their mother was still alive knowing she is gone.

But my god, 2 years of them internally questioning why their parents were just \u201cgone\u201d. Taking away their choice of saying good bye. The abandonment and neglect they must be processing hasn\u2019t even begun to surface yet. This was beyond a selfish move and everyone failed them", "NTA. Fuck that, he lied by omission on THEIR MOTHER'S PASSING. Like honestly what was his plan? Like seriously? Did he really think that it would be better to stall for the rest of their lives instead of giving them the opportunity to grieve?\nAs someone who lost their mother a bit more than 3 weeks ago, i'd be furious if i learned my stepdad has hidden from me that she died.", "That's kind of what I thought, too, he couldn't tell them because then it's really real for him, too.", "That his \u201cfriends\u201d are calling an OP an asshole for telling his kids is infuriating.\n\nFar too often (and I see this in my own family) adults consider the feelings of their friends and siblings over how children are being treated, like children are posessions or equivalent to a personal opinion that no one can say anything about.", "Yeah even toddlers need to be told the truth in an age appropriate way. These girls got no chance to say goodbye! At all! They should have been told as soon as mom was diagnosed so they could process properly and be involved at their level with saying goodbye. I\u2019m glad they seem to be getting counseling because that is messed up. \n\nA friend of mine recently died in a car accident. Her fianc\u00e9\u2019s kids (early elementary and kindergarten age) attended and spoke at the funeral, with the support of their dad, AND their mom and grandmother, and my friend\u2019s mom and grandmother. It was important to them to participate and say goodbye- they were given the choice to go or not - and they weren\u2019t lied to about what happened. They participated at their own level with support from all the adults in their life."]}
