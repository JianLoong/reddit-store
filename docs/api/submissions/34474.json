Our two boys (13,12) and our girl (10). \n\nBefore we became parents my husband and I were ,one and done, meaning we only wanted one child. And we wanted a girl. And if our first child would have been a girl, she would very very likely be an only child. However, I am beyond thankful that we had to try 3 times. I love my boys and wouldn\u2019t trade them in for anything in the world. But the truth is that we only tried 3 times because the first one and the second one  weren\u2019t girls. \n\nYesterday my boys were picking on their little sister. Normally they adore her but yesterday they would not stop making fun of her. They said something like we should put her up for adoption because she is the last one. They were obviously joking but it upset their sister to the point where she had tears in her eyes. I told them to knock it off again and again but they continued. In the end I said that they should be thankful that their sister is the youngest one because I only wanted a girl and they would not be there if I had my daughter first. They looked at me in horror. My oldest one asked me if this is really true and I said yes. I know it was harsh and hurtful but they were bullies. My younger son started to sob and the older called me a b*tch. Then they ran to their room. \n\nWhen I told my husband what happened, he called me an absolute AH and nutjob for telling our sons the truth.

You literally stooped to the same level of behavior you asked your children to not engage in.  You literally just told them they were unwanted...it is going to be really hard to come back from this, as words like this damage children's psyche. It may be very difficult for then now to not see things as us vs their sister when it comes to the things you do for them.\n\nIt is a terrible feeling when you think your parent doesnt want you the same way they want your sibling. A when you have confirmation of it, let me tell you, that shit sticks with you.\n\nSo, I am horrified for your boys and I do not blame your husband one bit for what he said.  What kind of person says this to their children?", "Coming from someone who truly wasn't wanted because of her sex at birth ... YTA more than you could ever know.  Knowing the truth, this is still very hurtful even decades later.  I live my life knowing that I am never enough.  Your careless choice of words is beyond incredible.  Your husband and sons have every right to be angry and not speak to you.  What a condescending ugly inappropriate way for any person calling themselves a mother, to behave  \n\n\nLet me add this to \"my story\"  I intended to say/imply that I am never enough for the parent involved.  Yes, there has been therapy, I am happily married over 35 years and doing pretty well.  Thank you to those of you who reached out with positivity, support and love.  Honestly there is not enough of that anymore, please continue to do this, you are all so kind.", "Wow. YTA. Why would you tell your sons this?? \n\nIf they didn't know your daughter was your golden child, they definitely do now. \n\nYou deal with conflict between your kids like the parent you are.

Things may be normal soon but they will NEVER forget that you said this & it will play in their heads every time you do something nice for your daughter and even in other situations.

You told them to stop. They, like every child whose ever existed before them, chose to ignore their parent. \n\nSo instead of separating them, explaining what they did that was so hurtful and why it was wrong, and then doling out appropriate punishments, you decided to, what? Scar them for life and fracture your relationship with them, maybe irrevocably? And added resentment to their, previously fairly good, relationship with their sister. Putting a burden on her that isn\u2019t her fault at all. \n\nMy bet is this is not the first time you have done something wildly inappropriate as a parent. You need some real therapy. Like deep therapy. Individually and with your children and your children need it individually at this point as well. My bet is you need couples therapy with your husband too, after this. \n\nI\u2019d personally have a hard time ever trusting my kids with my spouse again if they did something like this.

Trust me they will forever remember this and hold grudge against you!\n\nThis reminds me of my own mother who told me and my siblings that she wished we never existed and wish to have daughters instead of sons. Do you realise how f*cked up that is for not feel wanted because of your gender? \n\nThe psychological damage you've created! This is so messed up! They will forever remember it in their grave! This freaking boils my blood when parents utter these kind of stuff to their own child!", "YTA, OP. Your children, each of them, deserve to feel you want them and they are cherished for themselves, not their gender. You do not need to share every nuance of your reproductive choices with your preteens and teens. There is such a thing as being too much information. Maybe when they are all adults and making decisions like that themselves, you could carefully share that in a way that would not hurt them. But now? And in order to stop what sounds like normal sibling roughhousing? YTA. Your husband is right.

I wonder if you will ever be able to repair your relationships with your sons. Not only that, they may very well develop a resentment toward your daughter through no fault of her own. What were you thinking? This doesn\u2019t sound like love at all. Shame on you. Every child deserves to feel wanted by their parents regardless of misbehaving.", "YTA better focus on your relationship with your precious daughter, since you\u2019ve just told your boys that you\u2019ll never want or love them as much as her.", "I also want to point out the damage this will do to the sister as well. She\u2019s also innocent but this is a way to create a division between siblings.\n\nI was the golden child as the only girl. I have two brothers in particular with different moms who treated me horribly because of me being my dad\u2019s only daughter, and I, in my 30\u2019s still feel like I owe them for being born but it got so bad I had to cut them out of my life because of how toxic their bitterness was. \n\nThey were innocent and made to feel a way about my birth by their mother and they took it out on me and I accepted that I DESERVED that treatment. It wasn\u2019t fair for either party. \n\nYour daughter is going to have issues too. Hopefully it will make them closer but her being the youngest and the only girl, and you saying this could drive them apart. \n\n+10000 for the husband and dad though!", "YTA as the unwanted child you\u2019ve destroyed your children. \n\nForever \n\nYou can\u2019t take it back.

Was is worth it?", "YTA. You were the adult in an emotionally charged situation, and instead of de-escalating it, you amped it up! There's no way those boys aren't going to resent their sister from here on out.

Good luck with the mess you caused.", "YTA you don\u2019t bully your children because they are teasing one of your other children.

Our two boys (13,12) and our girl (10). \n\nBefore we became parents my husband and I were ,one and done, meaning we only wanted one child. And we wanted a girl. And if our first child would have been a girl, she would very very likely be an only child. However, I am beyond thankful that we had to try 3 times. I love my boys and wouldn\u2019t trade them in for anything in the world. But the truth is that we only tried 3 times because the first one and the second one  weren\u2019t girls. \n\nYesterday my boys were picking on their little sister. Normally they adore her but yesterday they would not stop making fun of her. They said something like we should put her up for adoption because she is the last one. They were obviously joking but it upset their sister to the point where she had tears in her eyes. I told them to knock it off again and again but they continued. In the end I said that they should be thankful that their sister is the youngest one because I only wanted a girl and they would not be there if I had my daughter first. They looked at me in horror. My oldest one asked me if this is really true and I said yes. I know it was harsh and hurtful but they were bullies. My younger son started to sob and the older called me a b*tch. Then they ran to their room. \n\nWhen I told my husband what happened, he called me an absolute AH and nutjob for telling our sons the truth. When I begged him to help me to comfort them he told me to f*ck off and now he and my boys are not talking to me and the boys are ignoring their sister.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Makes perfect sense. \ud83d\ude44 Idk why you thought this would go any differently. Even if that was the original plan with your husband, your children don't need to know that.

That they should somehow be *grateful* their sister didn\u2019t come first.  \n\nKids squabble.  It\u2019s what they do at this age.  You weaponized your desire to have a girl as a reason why your sons shouldn\u2019t pick on their little sister.  Were they being cruel\u2026yes, in the way that siblings often are.

I\u2019m so sorry. Not to pry, and you don\u2019t have to answer, but were you a different ethnicity from them?

So they had to try 3 times to get me. My mom got her boys, my dad got his girl.

It was all such a blessing\u201d so very different", "I agree, but that's the key here: when they were older and more mature. \n\nWhile they're still in the phase of jeering about giving the youngest up for adoption is not that time. \n\nIMO you don't tell kids nuanced truths like \"Both of us didn't want kids when we found out we were pregnant, but proceeded with the pregnancy and grew to love the idea.\" Kids will hear what they hear, and it may not be the important part, and it may scar them to believe they were not wanted.", "If you read my post it doesn\u2019t say they\u2019re ok.

Even IF she hasn't doted on her, they're likely looking back and seeing something else entirely. She has effectively destroyed her family. I'd divorce her, and go for custody of the boys.

I'm not saying that it's ok in any way", "They'll be watching everything their mother does from now on, looking for favoritism. And they'll see it, whether it exists or not.
