She explicitly agreed. It was unfair for her to back out of that. If she couldn\u2019t pay her half as she said she would, then she should\u2019ve been open to rearranging the place or rescheduling the time.", "NTA \n\nWtf? You told her and then she threw a fit? Why do you HAVE to pay if that\u2019s your partner? Partners get through things TOGETHER. \n\nMaybe that should be your last anniversary dinner.", "NTA. You agreed in advance. Your girlfriend\u2019s behaviour is the embarrassment here. Plus why should you have to fund the whole dinner? It\u2019s a shared anniversary", "NTA. It's not a birthday; it's an anniversary that belongs to the two of you. She agreed to split it, which makes sense, then she made a fuss about...being expected to do what she said she'd do.", "I just can't imagine ever expecting that from someone and being so arrogant to tell them how embarrassed I am to have to ask them to pay for me for our anniversary. What did she do for you for the anniversary? Did she buy you anything? Honestly this would be the last anniversary if that were me. NTA", "NTA.  It was your anniversary together, not HER anniversary.  And you told her ahead of time.  Not sure why it would be just your financial responsibility to cover dinner.", "What did she give you for your anniversary?.\n\nNta.", "NTA Find someone more in tune with things.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is TA for agreeing to pay half and then backing out at the restaurant.", "NTA. If you sprung it on her at the restaurant yes, but you asked her in advance.", "Why are people in relationships if they view their partner negatively if they couldn\u2019t afford food or ask for a split. Things happen and if you have the means to do it, why not. No need to put down your partner. NTA", "Yikes NTA", "NTA\n\nWhen she backed out of the bill. You should have had the waiter split it. Paid your half and went home. Don't be a pushover. \n\nShe agreed to pay for half and backed out. That is when you should have been like fuck this shit. \n\nIf she cared about you and your financial wellbeing. She wouldn't have backed out. \n\nYour girlfriend is selfish and self-centered.\nAnd you don't have to tolerate it. \n\nYou deserve to be with someone who doesn't only care about themselves.", "NTA. Why couldn't she treat you for the anniversary?? She sees herself as the center of the relationship", "NTA - read the red flag and make it the last anniversary with her.", "NTA.  This is why you date for a period of time.  It's to get to know someone after they've let the mask slip.  I would view both the reneging to split the bill and the gaslighting as if she hadn't as red flags.  On another subject, drop this \"men pay\" nonsense.    If you were in a traditional relationship with a traditional woman, she would have said \" if there isn't enough money for that restaurant, lets go to a different one.\" Or even better, let's put the money you can afford towards the the makings for a good meal and we'll cook it together.\"  If she knew you couldn't afford it yet gaslit you into taking her to that restaurant anyway, she's likely not a keeper.", "NTA. My husband and I take turns paying. All part of being in a relationship. She knew in advance and agreed.", "NTA. I was with my last partner for over a year and even though the relationship didn't end up working out we always either split our bills for our meals or traded off paying for all our meals. We liked going out a lot and always made sure that were equally footing the bill. I'm (49 F) a lesbian and they were/are non binary. \n\nThe \"man pays\" is a stupid tradition and l really loved that neither of us ever expected other to pay. I think it's realy unfair of your girlfriend to expect you to pay just because you're \"the man\". That's ick. \n\nEspecially on your Anniversary, especially when you expressly told her money was tight. Super insensitive and not cool.", "Why should you pay? It is your anniversary too and she can pay for what she consumed. It isn\u2019t embarrassing to be an adult - NTA", "NTA", "NTA. She\u2019s dating you as well, it\u2019s not one sided", "NTA. \nWhy should only she get a treat when it's both your anniversary? Plus, she agreed beforehand. She is being absurd and acting like a spoilt child.", "NTA but she is. She's really selfish to know that you are short on money, agree to split the bill, and then act like a spoiled brat until she gets her way.", "NTA but I'd be amazed it you have a second anniversary.", "NTA. There is no reason the man has to pay for an anniversary dinner. You also told her the situation ahead of time, and she agreed.", "NTA. Is there a reason she didn't pay and treat you? Ffs, is she not celebrating being w you too?!?!", "Dump her.\nShe expected you to still go out when you said you were short on cash. When you said you still wanted to go, she fussed about paying half the bill. But she agreed. THEN she renigged abd had a tantrum. Are you sure this is the type of person you want a relationship with? Someone who is \"embarrassed\" to split the bill as ahreed upon previously? No one would have noticed or cared if she hadn't made a fuss.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you invite them and choose the restaurant, you should pay. Yes, it's a little bit sexist because guys are expected to ask. But the guy paying in perpetuity is a lot sexist. To me, it seems like borderline prostitution. Does she expect this on every date, or just because it's a special occasion? But it's your special occasion as much as hers. If it were her birthday, it might be a different story.\n\nIn any case, you agreed in advance. You didn't embarrass her. She embarrassed you. She didn't have to make a fuss.", "NTA", "Anniversaries are about bonding, not spoiling.  It\u2019s not her special day, you\u2019re celebrating each other.  Yikes and gross.

When you got home", "YTA- why would you suggest going out if you can\u2019t afford it? There are so many options for celebrating that don\u2019t cost much.", "YTA. I\u2019d have canceled the date the week before when you brought up splitting the bill.", "NTA , but seems like a lot of women think  there money is there money and his money is her money not all women but a vast majority of them and see it as a turn off if they have to split cost for anything , find a new gf who wants to go 50/50 problem solved", "You have different values. For her it\u2019s important that the male pays or she doesn\u2019t feel valued. You take a more practical approach, who pays depends in part on who has money. I\u2019d let tempers cool then talk about how you\u2019ll approach money matters going forward (assuming you want to stay together)", "NTA - you checked in advance and she agreed", "NTA at all.  More on her", "NTA. She agreed to split. You might want to think about things", "But the anniversary is for the both of you not just her", "She could treat you", "Discussed and agreed on. Don't sweat it.", "NTA \n\nBut only if that\u2019s the last dinner you have with her. If someone loves you they work with you in good times and bad, feast or famine. I had a bf tell me he was stretched thin financially but still wanted to take me out to a dinner I knew he couldn\u2019t afford. When he came to pick me up I surprised him with a homemade candlelight dinner. I told him I loved him and kissed him before he sat down. It was a wonderful, relaxing and fun night.\n\nGo find someone that cares enough to work with you instead of thinking only of themselves.", "What?????\n\nNTA. You asked ahead of time, that\u2019s so bratty of her.  \n\nAnniversary is for BOTH of you, split makes sense.  It\u2019s not a birthday treat", "NTA Red flag. Why didn't she treat you?", "NTA but you asked to split the bill?  Or paid half but your food was more expensive \n\nWere  your choices more expensive than hers? \n\n\nI would have asked for separate checks and if a bottle of wine was ordered than split that down the middle \n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t her birthday and you both could have made a n incredible meal together at home for a lot less", "NTA. It's an anniversary, it belongs to and celebrates both of you so I see nothing wrong with her paying too.\n\nNow if it was her birthday.... no. \n\nDoes she often expect you to pay for everything?", "You two sound incompatible.  She wants someone with money to pay for her. You want an equal partner, plus you're probably currently poor. Let her find someone else for her next anniversary.", "NTA. It was unfair for her to back out of paying, even though she agreed beforehand. If she also can\u2019t afford a fancy anniversary dinner, she should\u2019ve told you and you could maybe choose a more affordable place to eat at.", "NTA. She asked you and said it was fine.  This is your anniversary too, not just hers. You're not obligated to treat her unless you want to. It's not like it's her birthday, but it's a day for you both. This is beyond selfish of her. If she actually wanted a long term relationship with you, she should understand that sometimes you might not have it and she may have to help you out. That's how a healthy functional relationship works.", "NTA. You explained the situation prior to the dinner and she agreed. If it was an issue she should have told you when you brought it up. \n\nThe idea of celebrating an anniversary is to celebrate being together as partners. Sometimes that means you either split the bill or change the plans. If she wanted to be \u201ctreated\u201d you could have chose a different restaurant or cooked her a nice meal and cleaned up after.", "Nta. Maybe in her next anniversary with her next partner she will see her mistakes and pay for her share. Why are you with someone so selfish?", "why couldn't pay for both of you??\n\nIt's not a celebration for her alone... NTA", "Let me guess, she works but her money is her money and your money is our money. Live cheaper dude, try going solo for a while. You can't afford a gf.", "Attitude, she gave OP entitled attitude for their anniversary.", "He should have pushed for sex and then shamed her if she didn't want to. If I'm gonna get shamed into being the one who always pays, you're gonna be the one who puts out. If you don't like that treatment, there's the door. Harsh but there's your rigid gender stereotypes.", "You\u2019re wrong. She still should be expecting to pay her half since it\u2019s THEIR anniversary not hers.", "I agree!!!", "Not every relationship is transactional\u2026 I feel bad for your girlfriend if you have one.", "Is there an award for worst advice on the internet?", "Lmao. Who hurt you bud?", "This is sarcasm. Some women want to act like they're infallible when it comes to their expectations or preferences but if a man has any, he's out of line. Just like a guy acting like that wouldn't be acceptable, a girl acting like OP's girlfriend is unacceptable. Men are not ATMs and women aren't sex slaves. You treat each other with respect. Not with sexist expectations.", "The issue is you seem to think the two behaviors are equally bad. They aren\u2019t.", "Please get therapy. I\u2019m not being an ass.
