If you were in a traditional relationship with a traditional woman, she would have said \" if there isn't enough money for that restaurant, lets go to a different one.\" Or even better, let's put the money you can afford towards the the makings for a good meal and we'll cook it together.\"  If she knew you couldn't afford it yet gaslit you into taking her to that restaurant anyway, she's likely not a keeper.", "NTA.

If you invite them and choose the restaurant, you should pay. Yes, it's a little bit sexist because guys are expected to ask. But the guy paying in perpetuity is a lot sexist.
