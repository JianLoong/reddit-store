You don\u2019t know why she was fired; there could be a legitimate complaint there and that\u2019s why Jack has never been on board with Bella and Dave dating. And by supporting her, you are turning your back on him. This isn\u2019t a simple grudge.", "Although I think Jack is overreacting to you helping pay for the wedding or you attending, your comment does not speak to Dave or his family being a \"good\" family or having much integrity.

If his girlfriend was a scapegoat for Dave or his family's misconduct, that could be a big issue. \n\nIf she was fired to hide some sort of ethical violation, that could be an issue meaning that maybe Dave isn't as good of a guy as he is being touted and perhaps his family isn't really a good family. \n\nIt might not be any of those things, but OP has been very vague on the subject.", "I can see Jack\u2019s point about contributing to the wedding.

I went through your comments before passing judgement OP. Naturally you want your daughter to get married into money but this doesn't sound like a simple grudge.

If he genuinely thinks she was mistreated I can understand he's still salty about it BUT why does he not trust his sister's judgement in finding a partner? Surely if Bella picked Dave to marry, he's a good guy and Jack should think to himself \"Huh, maybe I made a snap judgement about Dave (and his family?) and maybe my ex(?) girlfriend was embellishing the story of how she was let go.\"\n\nJack should have a chat with Dave about it just to figure out what happened if Dave is interested in having this conversation.", "NTA\n\n\n\nDid it suck that gf lost her job so dave could be hired?
