You don\u2019t know why she was fired; there could be a legitimate complaint there and that\u2019s why Jack has never been on board with Bella and Dave dating. And by supporting her, you are turning your back on him.

If his girlfriend was a scapegoat for Dave or his family's misconduct, that could be a big issue. \n\nIf she was fired to hide some sort of ethical violation, that could be an issue meaning that maybe Dave isn't as good of a guy as he is being touted and perhaps his family isn't really a good family. \n\nIt might not be any of those things, but OP has been very vague on the subject.", "I can see Jack\u2019s point about contributing to the wedding.

I went through your comments before passing judgement OP. Naturally you want your daughter to get married into money but this doesn't sound like a simple grudge.

If he genuinely thinks she was mistreated I can understand he's still salty about it BUT why does he not trust his sister's judgement in finding a partner? Surely if Bella picked Dave to marry, he's a good guy and Jack should think to himself \"Huh, maybe I made a snap judgement about Dave (and his family?) and maybe my ex(?) girlfriend was embellishing the story of how she was let go.\"\n\nJack should have a chat with Dave about it just to figure out what happened if Dave is interested in having this conversation.", "NTA\n\n\n\nDid it suck that gf lost her job so dave could be hired?

Topic came up also years later with my mom. Instead of taking my brother's side (which you seem to do in this scenario from your son't pov), she validated my feelings, told me she would have been a lot angrier than I had been and so not okay with him having done that. It isn't the exact same scenarip of course, but it's still 2 sides where I can see your son not feeling validated.\n\nBUT him trying to direct you there is also out of line.", "INFO: chronological timelines, please?", "Read OP\u2019s comment: according to her, the department in this company that Jack\u2019s girlfriend worked in already had enough people by the time they wanted to hire Dave. So the hiring manager (who is also Dave\u2019s father) let\u2019s go of Jack\u2019s gf in favor of Dave. \n\nAnd while I agree that that doesn\u2019t mean Jack can tell his parents what to do with their money, it does provide context and doesn\u2019t exactly portray Dave and his family in the light that OP\u2019s post does. So I\u2019m going with ESH.\n\nEdit: OP gives more context that makes Dave\u2019s family look even worse \n\n>Dave's sister apparently passed off some of the work Jack's girlfriend's did as her own. There were a few people that worked together on projects, Jack's girlfriend would do her portion and pass it along to Dave's sister, which she then said she did herself in meetings and things. Jack said she made a complaint but they told her if she doesn't like it she can leave, and they'd write her up for antisocial behavior or something like that.\n\nSo Jack\u2019s girlfriend stands up for herself when Dave\u2019s sister steals her work, she later gets fired to make room for Dave, and then OP says they\u2019re a *good family* in her post? And she can\u2019t understand her son\u2019s frustration somehow?

Where you see a grudge I see someone seeing an injustice and wanting that acknowledged.\n\nRegardless of whether you believe this to be true or not, you've been entirely dismissive of your sons feelings. I also don't think you are in a good place to tell whether Dave is a good guy or not. Likely you will find this out in years he is married to your daughter. He may be someone who is just an opportunist, or this entitlement he may share with his sister and could cause issues with his life later on. Only time will tell. If that does prove to be true, by the response you gave I can guarantee two things, your son will remind you of this (if still talking to you) and you (based on this AITA), that you will be angry with him about that too, rather than acknowledge your own potential part in it.\n\nYou don't have to do what your son asks and you can respond in whatever way you see fit, however he will see this as standing up for something important and morally 'good', with you ignoring and saying it isn't important. If it were me, my respect for you would suffer tremendously as a parent.\n\nYour actions can be explained, but your words (which were more important), were terrible.", "Wow hard to make judgment call on this. But going to with ESH. If your son gets married to his girlfriend Besure to spend the same amount on his wedding (taking note with inflation) .", "NTA.", "You are a major disloyal AH or a troll.\n\nHere's the missing context people. Where asking:\n\n> What I heard is that Dave's sister already worked there and she had some issues with Jack's girlfriend. Then Dave was going to get a job at his dad's company, but they'd hired enough people for that department already, so his dad/hiring manager let Jack's girlfriend go to hire Dave\n\nand\n\n\n> Dave's sister apparently passed off some of the work Jack's girlfriend's did as her own. \n[...] Jack said she made a complaint but they told her if she doesn't like it she can leave, and they'd write her up for antisocial behavior or something like that.\n\n\nSo you and your daughter new Jack and his family where a bunch of nepotistic abusive AH 2 years before she started dating. And, even so, you both choose to side with them instead your son and his GF.\n\nYTA.", "NAH. How Dave's family treated Jack's ex gf was atrocious and immoral ( creating a hostile workplace, taking credit for other's work, umjustly firing her after a well-supported claim, and nepotism). For the previous reasons mentioned,I could understand why he would not support a romantic relationship between Dave and his sister. However time has passed since then so it's possible Dave has changed and his moral code has improved since being in a relationship with your daughter. You're not wrong for wanting to support and celebrate this major milestone in your daughter's life but you should see the situation from your son's POV as well. Your son formed his opinion on how Dave and Dave's family mistreatment of his gf and its not ok that you're throwing his feelings to the side. It's not ok for him to demand that you don't attend/contribute to your daughter's wedding and it's not ok that your don't respect his feelings about Dave/Dave's family", "YTA and NTA at the same time in my opinion. \n\nNTA because Jack can\u2019t expect you not to attend the wedding and contribute towards it. But at the same time, I completely understand why Jack is unhappy about the situation since Dave\u2019s family sound horrible based on the additional information you gave in the comments! Maybe you should try to listen to your sons side a bit more when his girlfriend was laid if due to a family obsessed with nepotism", "NTA but Jack is.", "i get  the brother... getting some toxic people to actually become your family", "Question is .. how does OP and the rest of the family treat Jack\u2019s girlfriend? Are you \u201cbeyond excited \u201c that they are dating as you are with Dave & your daughter? Do you include her in\nAll family functions and great her the same way you treat Dave? Is she a member of your family? I noticed you don\u2019t mention her by name throughout - but it\u2019s Jack, Dave, Bella, girlfriend-so I\u2019m thinking you don\u2019t approve or you don\u2019t treat her as a part of the family. You mention attending Jacks wedding (if they should marry) Are you planning on Contributing the SAME amount towards Jack & girlfriends wedding? \nAlso question- how did your daughter meet Dave? \nYou seem to be missing a lot of important information.", "Yah. She was fired because Jack's sister tried to use her as doormat and she wouldn't let her...\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15m5f1n/comment/jvfahhp/", "Also in another comment OP explains that the \u201cissue\u201d Dave\u2019s sister had with Jacks gf was that the gf reported when the sister took credit for her work. The girlfriend got told off and accused of being anti-social. They really are horrible ppl. WAY to bury the lead!", "They downsized during the pandemic but it's a smaller/medium sized company", ">How much is Dave contributing to the wedding? Is Jack's girlfriend still in the picture, the one who got fired?\n\nDave (and Bella) are paying for most of the wedding, but the 2 families are also contributing. We're only paying for around 10% of it. We would also contribute to Jack's wedding if he ever decides to get married. And no she's not", "Ok, but to be fair *Dave* didn't pass off Jack's girlfriend's work as his own nor did he fire her. Even if Dave's parents fired her to free up space to hire him (which, admittedly, is shitty if true) that's on his parents, not him.\n\nIt might make it understandable why Jack doesn't have the best opinion of Dave's family, but not why he's being ridiculous about the wedding between Bella & Dave or their relationship in general. He could easily say \"hey, you know I don't love Dave's family, so can you make sure I'm seated at a table far away from them please\". Jack & the girlfriend aren't together anymore so it's not like she'd be there & that might cause a scene. Jack is an adult in his 30s, surely he can suck up slights against his ex-girlfriend & just play nice with Dave's family (or at least politely ignore them) for ***one day*** at his sister's wedding?!", "Because of nepotism? They literally fired her so they could give Dave the job?", "That doesn't sound nearly as bad as others are making it out. Sucks to be let go, but a padded resume and some time to find a new job are a great boon. Unless it's low-/no- skill labor, most jobs can be used to catapult you higher in the field.", "\ud83d\ude02 you just keep avoiding telling the whole truth in one go, don\u2019t you? You know you\u2019re an AH and are just happy your daughter is marrying rich. \n\nFYI: stealing other people\u2019s work and then firing them when they complain is not a sign of a \u201cgood family\u201d. \n\nHere\u2019s hoping your daughter gets a good lawyer for her prenup so she isn\u2019t totally SOL when she gets traded in for a younger model.", "Do you really think what happened at that job 2 years before her daughter started dating Dave is good enough reason to not want to be part of her daughter's wedding. Give me a break... He is allowed to not go but he can't expect his parents to do the same. That's ridiculous.", "Of course, she'd care more about her daughter than her son's girlfriend.", "but would you hold such a grudge yeeears later and demand your parents not to attend your sister's wedding.", "Will you contribute financially to the wedding if Jack gets married?", "Nepotism rarely favors the higher skilled. In fact, the opposite is far more likely.", "Dave's sister apparently passed off some of the work Jack's girlfriend's did as her own. There were a few people that worked together on projects, Jack's girlfriend would do her portion and pass it along to Dave's sister, which she then said she did herself in meetings and things. Jack said she made a complaint but they told her if she doesn't like it she can leave, and they'd write her up for antisocial behavior or something like that.", "Because that's only Jack's girlfriend, not a fiance, not a wife nor the mother of his children. If they break up it'd be extremely awkward, Jack would have not attended the wedding of his sister because of an ex-girlfriend. I have wedding photos with my brother's ex included in \"family\" pictures because he thought she was the \"one,\" he's married to someone else lol.", "There is a vague reference that Jack and the girl are no longer together, but no direct confirmation. If they are atill together, then it is understandable. Heck, even if they are still friends it\u2019s understandable.", "I might not attend the wedding myself. And if my sister knows of this, I might be upset at her too. But I won't stop anyone from attending the wedding. Although it might hurt me, they have the right to attend the wedding. Him being upset is understandable, especially if he is still with his gf. And it is not wrong of him to express his feelings to his family. But if he is demanding things, then that is not right.", "Yes we would", "It could not be considered an equal footing anyway since if she is already working there and Dave was not, well he'd likely have to learn in order to be productive, even if he HAD the skills.", "I'm subscribed to /r/WorkReform and /r/AntiWork, so I already knew that, LOL. Either way, it's not a good idea to let problems develop with a co-worker when their father signs both of your checks. Until something comes out that paints those issues as more than workplace BS, though, I'm still disagreeing with that Everyone Sucks assessment.", "Mainly because if the person is higher skilled then it\u2019s not nepotism - it\u2019s just hiring the best candidate.", "I was assuming that her \"issues\" with them ultimately got bad enough that they were forced to choose between them.", "Listen how can you type this out, and the part about nepotism and not understand Jack's point of view?", "Oh so Jack is right...they are terrible people. YTA", ">Dave is a good guy from a good family\n\n\nWe obviously have different definitions of good. Someone who steals and takes credit for someone else's hard work is not good. A family who knows thier family member is doing this but decides to ignore and threaten the innocent party is not good. A man who knows his sister is bullying a colleague of hers and happily helps by taking that person's job is not a good man.\n\n\nThis family sounds morally bankrupt. But I wonder if your definition of good is less about morals and more about money.", "Yikes. N T A for doing what you want with your money. But Bella\u2019s SIL doesn\u2019t sound like a nice person. So i get Jack holding the grudge and think you shouldn\u2019t have criticized him for his own feelings. He overstepped by making demands of you guys though.\nESH", "So Dave\"s family are major AHs and you're defending them and intentionally leaving this kind of important details out of the main post. Maybe you should grow up.\n\nYou're not an AH for going to the wedding but YTA for your attitude alone. Would've cost you nothing to admit your son has valid reasons not to like Dave.", "Yeah Dave getting the job in his family company was about how qualify he was \ud83d\ude44 you can\u2019t be that  naive", "Are you really this naive? If she had the job then she was qualified for it. This isn't a case of them competing for the same job role they literally fired someone to open a spot for their family member. This is text book nepotism.", "Most likely because traditionally the brides family pays. They sound like the type to be super traditional from how OP talks.", "A lot of the time parents contribute to their kids weddings? We're not paying for all of it, we're contributing to our daughter's wedding. Dave's family is also contributing because it's their son's wedding, and Dave and Bella are covering most of it.", "Why would you assume that rather than good old-fashioned nepotism?", "Not where I am at now, but I have had managers and supervisors pass off things that I did as their work. And when customers have come back and point me out as the person that did the actual project/work, the supervisor would say, I am her supervisor and she would still take credit for it.", "That\u2019s a family business, of course that family will be favored. If he\u2019s as good as her, or better, then he will get the job. He will probably be in leadership at some point, that\u2019s how it works.", "Welcome to family businesses, what would you expect? \ud83d\ude05 if he\u2019s as qualified as she is or more of course he will get the job, he\u2019s the one that will have to lead the business at some point, or at least have some kind of leadership.", "And I get tradition, but in this situation we are taking about a wealth family the couple almost 30 and it\u2019s adding to a already tense situation because of past issues. Sometimes traditions are worth it.", "I wasn't? I've been saying this whole time that nepotism was almost certainly involved in why the owners fired the GF over their own son. I don't even know what the \"issues\" were, but it would be very unlikely for them to just randomly fire some woman in their son's department if there was no conflict at all.", "I think you pinpointed Jack's problem with this situation when you said \"most people would choose to support family over some stranger\" yet his sister and mother did not.\n\nPeople always want you to get over it when they treat you badly", "Nepotism sucks and, yes, it is expected in a family business. That doesn\u2019t mean that the victim, Jack\u2019s GF, nor Jack himself have to like it. Nor that he now has to become buddies with the person for whom his GF was let go, even if he is his future BIL. Depending on how Jack formulated his dissent with his parents\u2019 intention to contribute to his sister\u2019s wedding, you could or could not find fault with him. If he worded it coolly, calmly and respectfully, explaining what his problem with his parents\u2019 approach was (which they might have thought of without him having to tell them), then I\u2019d give Jack a pass on this one and call his mother an AH. If he wasn\u2019t respectful, then his mother could have told him off about that.", "Sheesh, well when you put it like that, I'm starting to agree with the mom(lol). Good points, though...", "That's so infuriating. I'm sorry that happened to you. I hope wherever you are now you are being appreciated", "So is it nepotism or not? At first you are saying he got it on merit and now it's just family business? It is straight up nepotism. Whether or not you consider it a good or bad thing is personal but it is what it is.", "I know that, and you know that, but I've met several families who would happily cover up the murder of a family member who broke their traditions or \"lives in sin.\" People be crazy about thus stuff for no reason", "Its causing tension in the  family, in a situation already filled with tension because of the past. I think tradition isn\u2019t worth it. And if Dave cared about the family he was marrying into he would try and make things better. A start to that would be paying for his own wedding. OP seems blinded by the wedding and Dave and his \u201cgood family\u201d to realize she could lose her son. He\u2019s likely to go NC. But maybe that doesn\u2019t matter to OP", "You haven't been saying that at all. I mean, your comments suggest only that they'd choose him on an equal footing, due to nepotism. The situation isn't equal.\n\nEveryone else is pointing out the facts that you are ignoring, which are:\n\n* She already had the job.\n* He (Dave) didn't have a job.\n* The department did not have capacity or space for one person.\n\nAt least in most places they don't really have an easy way to fire someone unless it is an at will state, generally places make roles redundant which makes it a little difficult to hire for people without being sued. Regardless it's not normal to hire someone to replace another person unless they have given notice (disciplinary procedures should be in order to turn the persons performance around, not a timeline for dismissal).\n\nThe point is it sounds like these issues never became an issue until Dave wanted a job. Which makes it much more likely these reasons were just managing them out. It's a little niaive to say things like, \"but it would be very unlikely for them to just randomly fire some woman in their son's department if there was no conflict at all.\".\n\nIt's more frequent in smaller companies (especially owner/manager companies), but I've seen it even in larger companies, where people 'managed out' for lesser reasons than giving their son a job. It happens and it's fairly common. Both nepotism and managing people out. Generally they are terrible in comparison to the average worker. \n\nThis makes no difference to the outcome however, Dave's father might be an AH and Dave complicit in it, but supporting their daughters wedding comes first over stepping into something Jacks father has no business over. One thing is likely is that the grandkids will have jobs.", "The issues were with Dave's sister who already worked there taking credit for the gf's work and then management telling the gf to like it or lump it. Theyre awful people and bullys", "I mean the mother is supporting her daughter, hardly a stranger.\n\nAs for his sister, if we go by what OP has said in comments, she was giving plenty of flexibility to find a new job. It wasn't a \"don't show up tomorrow\" situation. Not really mistreatment. \n\nAlso, we don't know Dave's involvement here. For all we know, it was always the plan for him to join the company. If so, he is blameless here, the fault is with whoever hired more people than they should. \n\nI don't blame Jack for not wanting to the wedding, in order to support his partner. That's his choice. But if Dave makes OP's daughter happy, why shouldn't OP support the marriage?", "The point is that he might deserve that job and not just get it because he\u2019s a family member. Then he will be favored because he\u2019s family and he\u2019s the future of the business, but that\u2019s just normal. It would be wrong if he was actually not qualified for the job and got it just because.", "OP just said contributing to the wedding and attending, no where I can read that they\u2019re the only ones providing. For some parents it is very important to contribute to their child\u2019s wedding, especially if it\u2019s their daughter. You don\u2019t like his family because they favored their son, got it, but you\u2019re still making a whole lot of assumptions.", "Ahhh, okay. Must've missed that in the post; I thought the issues between them weren't expanded on. Fuck they future in-laws, in that case"]}
