You don\u2019t know why she was fired; there could be a legitimate complaint there and that\u2019s why Jack has never been on board with Bella and Dave dating. And by supporting her, you are turning your back on him.

If his girlfriend was a scapegoat for Dave or his family's misconduct, that could be a big issue. \n\nIf she was fired to hide some sort of ethical violation, that could be an issue meaning that maybe Dave isn't as good of a guy as he is being touted and perhaps his family isn't really a good family. \n\nIt might not be any of those things, but OP has been very vague on the subject.", "I can see Jack\u2019s point about contributing to the wedding.

I went through your comments before passing judgement OP. Naturally you want your daughter to get married into money but this doesn't sound like a simple grudge. Your son's gf was let go to make a vacant position for Dave to join the company. Your daughter started dating the rich guy and none of you seem to care and want to sweep this under the rug.

That's not exactly indicative of a \"good guy from a good family\", and Jack is justified in not liking him for that.\n\nHowever...

She was given time, and not just fired on the spot, so while not great, they wanted to hire someone else for her position, and did so. That happens.\n\nJack holding a grudge over that is rediculous.

If he genuinely thinks she was mistreated I can understand he's still salty about it BUT why does he not trust his sister's judgement in finding a partner? Surely if Bella picked Dave to marry, he's a good guy and Jack should think to himself \"Huh, maybe I made a snap judgement about Dave (and his family?) and maybe my ex(?) girlfriend was embellishing the story of how she was let go.\"\n\nJack should have a chat with Dave about it just to figure out what happened if Dave is interested in having this conversation.", "NTA\n\n\n\nDid it suck that gf lost her job so dave could be hired?

Topic came up also years later with my mom. Instead of taking my brother's side (which you seem to do in this scenario from your son't pov), she validated my feelings, told me she would have been a lot angrier than I had been and so not okay with him having done that. It isn't the exact same scenarip of course, but it's still 2 sides where I can see your son not feeling validated.\n\nBUT him trying to direct you there is also out of line.", "INFO: chronological timelines, please?", "Read OP\u2019s comment: according to her, the department in this company that Jack\u2019s girlfriend worked in already had enough people by the time they wanted to hire Dave. So the hiring manager (who is also Dave\u2019s father) let\u2019s go of Jack\u2019s gf in favor of Dave. \n\nAnd while I agree that that doesn\u2019t mean Jack can tell his parents what to do with their money, it does provide context and doesn\u2019t exactly portray Dave and his family in the light that OP\u2019s post does. So I\u2019m going with ESH.\n\nEdit: OP gives more context that makes Dave\u2019s family look even worse \n\n>Dave's sister apparently passed off some of the work Jack's girlfriend's did as her own. There were a few people that worked together on projects, Jack's girlfriend would do her portion and pass it along to Dave's sister, which she then said she did herself in meetings and things. Jack said she made a complaint but they told her if she doesn't like it she can leave, and they'd write her up for antisocial behavior or something like that.\n\nSo Jack\u2019s girlfriend stands up for herself when Dave\u2019s sister steals her work, she later gets fired to make room for Dave, and then OP says they\u2019re a *good family* in her post? And she can\u2019t understand her son\u2019s frustration somehow?

Jack has legitimate quarrel with the sister and father, but the quarrel with Dave himself, the groom, is more tertiary. \n\nOOP could absolutely have been much kinder and more compassionate with how she approached Jack\u2019s objections, but Jack was being a little ridiculous for trying to insist his parents make objections in the first place.", "While I agree with you that it's more likely that in most cases, a nepotism hire is less skilled than a non-nepotism hire, I still don't think that's an okay correlation to make.\n\nNepotism isn't skill based.

His girlfriend is dead?!?! Where was this information? Because that explains a lot.\n\nThe wedding is probably reopening old wounds and griefs.

OP seems to want to take a \"boo hoo grow up and get over your dead girlfriend\" approach, which is an excellent way to lose a son.", "The thing with nepotism is it's a family thing and Dave could've always chosen not to take the job.  Instead he chose to take it and replaced Jack's late GF.  So Dave is just as much a part of the problem.", "My point still stands since this is the attitude the brother carried over.\n\nAnd if Dave or his family is competing with a corpse then Luke is definitely the ahole.", "I totally agree.

If it's true that Jack really has never liked Dave, I would lean towards N T A, but if Jack's girlfriend's firing was because of Dave and was not justifiable I would say Y T A, but as it stands I don't think it's clear enough.", "Where does OP say Jack's girlfriend was fired to give Dave a job? In the post it says she was fired for issues with the boss and Dave's sister (though the \"and Dave I guess\" is pretty frustratingly unexplained). \n\nAlso, as I said below, Dave's role in the filing is entirely relevant, so obviously if Dave was sexually harassing someone that would be 100% relevant to his character.", "You must be really broken if you can write out all of this and still, somehow, think you aren't an asshole.

I find it highly unlikely that his hands were clean. It is a small/mid-size family company, and the changes were made because Dave wanted in. Dave's family didn't axe Jenny just because, they did so in response to Dave's interest in her job. And it would require some willful ignorance to float the idea to his parents that he wanted a job, but remain unaware of what that would mean in the real world. Especially since his sister (and parents) already were being jerks to Jenny. And, even if he was ignorant of the particulars (which hardly suggests good things about his business savvy, being unaware of what was happening in the job they were carving out for him), he would certainly become aware of things on his first day on the job.\n\nAnd to emphasize, I did say ESH, in part because it's bad form for Jack to make the demands he did, but his part is understandable and to some degree excusable. OP's, however, are not.

They just treat everyone with kindness and respect. \n\nThis family obviously doesn\u2019t do that.", "Feeling it, yes. How\u2019s he\u2019s outwardly acting? No.", "So Dave quite obviously does NOT come from a good family.", "I think that\u2019s a reductive view.

We all let down a friend sometimes, or dismiss someone\u2019s feelings when we\u2019re distracted or in a mood, or are unfair to someone we\u2019re in conflict with. That\u2019s not being a shitty person, that\u2019s just life.

Is any of it her fault? No. Is her death related to losing her job? I doubt it. He\u2019s throwing his emotions around in a tantrum & THAT is the immature part."]}
