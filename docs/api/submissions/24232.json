What I heard is that Dave's sister already worked there and she had some issues with Jack's girlfriend. Then Dave was going to get a job at his dad's company, but they'd hired enough people for that department already, so his dad/hiring manager let Jack's girlfriend go to hire Dave. She was given time to find another job and the option to leave on her own, which is what she did.\n\nJack at the time insisted they did this to his girlfriend because of the sister's issues and she was the easiest to pick on. Then when Bella and Dave started dating he blamed Dave as well since he knew what happened. At that point it was a couple of years earlier.\n\nEdited to add some info", "The thing is, that doesn\u2019t even remotely matter. Jack still needs to grow up.", "No Jack's not married, if he ever does of course we'll attend", "This.  There\u2019s a missing detail or two.", "Are you the son?", "Ah, then in his view (I\u2019m guessing) his sister betrayed him by dating the guy his girlfriend had a problem with. You don\u2019t know why she was fired; there could be a legitimate complaint there and that\u2019s why Jack has never been on board with Bella and Dave dating. And by supporting her, you are turning your back on him. This isn\u2019t a simple grudge.", "Although I think Jack is overreacting to you helping pay for the wedding or you attending, your comment does not speak to Dave or his family being a \"good\" family or having much integrity. I can see why Jack and his girlfriend have no desire to be around them.", "Info: what issues did Dave\u2019s sister have with Jack\u2019s girlfriend?", "Honestly, your son might not be far off the mark with some of the motivation for his girlfriend\u2019s firing. Unfortunately, one of the risks of working in a family business is unfair treatment and nepotism. I think it\u2019s understandable if Jack and/or his girlfriend don\u2019t feel comfortable attending the wedding, but demanding you cut off support for your daughter is going a bit too far. It seems an unnecessary overreaction.", "So from what it sounds like is that, Dave\u2019s sister didn\u2019t like Jack\u2019s Gf, and at the same time, Dave was trying to get into his father\u2019s company so they decided to fire the gf to hire Dave. I would feel a way about my sister dating the man my gf was fired for, too. NTA for paying for your daughter\u2019s wedding and attending. But you are TA for telling him stop holding grudges and act his age. His gf was fired from a company for a nepotism baby, and in turn your sister not only dates him but plans to marry him into the family. Why would you expect him to be okay with that?", "It could matter. If his girlfriend was a scapegoat for Dave or his family's misconduct, that could be a big issue. \n\nIf she was fired to hide some sort of ethical violation, that could be an issue meaning that maybe Dave isn't as good of a guy as he is being touted and perhaps his family isn't really a good family. \n\nIt might not be any of those things, but OP has been very vague on the subject.", "I can see Jack\u2019s point about contributing to the wedding. If Dave\u2019s family  owns an IT company why would the parents contribute financially? Why wouldn\u2019t Dave, cover the cost of the wedding, his family likely has more money Something doesn\u2019t add up with Dave. I think the mom might be blinded by the excitement of the wedding to listen to what her son is saying. I don\u2019t know about the \u201cyou love her more he fired my gf\u201ddrama. But helping financially is weird when Dave can cover the cost", "Look at OP comments: the girlfriend was let go so Dave could get her job.", "TBF, Dave may not have been aware of the whole situation surrounding his hiring. I doubt his sister was telling him \u201chey, you got the job! Of course I had to fire someone to make you a space first, but family, right?\u201d", "How is Dave's family at all relevant to whether Dave himself is a good person and loves Bella? Frankly, even in the original post I don't see the point in the \"comes from a good family\" comment.", "And why isn\u2019t Dave, who family owns his own company paying for the wedding? Something seems off with Dave and his family", "Dave\u2019s dad owns the company, not Dave. I\u2019d assume they are contributing but regardless of who has what money, it is usually tradition for the bride\u2019s family to at least contribute towards the dress. And I don\u2019t think a brother can complain at that tbh regardless of the situation. Any mum helping her daughter with a dress is kinda normal imo and a big bonding thing for many", "Traditional the bride\u2019s family pays for the whole wedding except for the rehearsal dinner. \ud83d\ude0a", "You are correct, I made an assumption that because OP knows so much about it then Dave must know as well.", "> some issues with the boss and Dave's sister (and Dave I guess). \n\nIt sounds like Dave worked at the company at the time Jack's girlfriend got fired.\n\nWithout hearing Jack's side of the story/why Jack's girlfriend got fired, it's impossible to make a judgment. \n\nSmall, family-owned companies that bully and eventually fire anyone who doesn't \"fit in\", regardless of how good they are at their jobs, definitely exist.", "Imagine if she was fired because she reported Dave for sexual harassment. (That's not the case here but it could be for all the post shares)\n\nThe truth is, she was fired so they could give the job to Dave. So Dave is literally the only reason she got fired.", "I caught that too. I\u2019m on the fence and think OP is TA. There are some missing details here", "Still something seems off. Who cares about tradition. This isn\u2019t the 1950\u2019s,Dave\u2019s got money and he is a grown man. He should be paying for his own wedding. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s only the dress it could be alot more.", "OP\u2019s been hearing about it from her son for years. So it\u2019s not surprising she knows it well.\n\nAnd Dave may know now (I\u2019d be shocked if he didn\u2019t, honestly), but what is he supposed to do? Quit his job? That won\u2019t get the GF back hers! It\u2019s an unfortunate situation, but he doesn\u2019t - and shouldn\u2019t - have to sacrifice his financial security because he learned, sometime after the fact, that he got the job due to his sister being unethical.\n\nNow, if he knew at the time, that\u2019s another story entirely.", "True, but my point is that his family itself should not factor into whether Dave is a shitty person. Plenty of nice people have terrible families and plenty of terrible people have nice families.\n\nI do think that Dave's *role* in the reason Jack's girlfriend was fired is relevant, but not really any of the surrounding family issues there."]}
