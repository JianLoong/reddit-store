Which in fairness makes sense to think that'd be my size since I'm really short (only 157cm).\n\nMy problem is that I've always had rather disproportionately sized breasts. They are way bigger than average, especially because the rest of my frame is really small. This causes me to have a lot of trouble finding proper clothes since they are always way too tight around the chest. That's why I always wear a few sizes up, and manually adjust things like the sleeves and the general length.\n\nSo I did try on the size they gave me, but I had a really hard time buttoning up, and when I finally managed to do so, I had trouble breathing and felt like if I made even the slightest wrong movement, the buttons would pop off. \n\nI asked the manager if I could try on a larger size, but she said this size is right for me because apparently it's only based on height. I wouldn't be allowed to wear a larger size because they don't want their employees to wear oversized or baggy clothes because it doesn't look good towards the customers.\n\nBecause it was so uncomfortable I took the uniform off and told my manager I have to wear a larger size because the other one is just too small for me. She told me to just wear what she's assigned to me, and if I'm unwilling, she'd fire me.
