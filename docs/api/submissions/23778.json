You love her but this is your livelihood. Show them the income gap to make your rent now. Also draw a stick figure flow diagram showing how they blocked the traffic to the table. Calculate the % jump in sales the day they weren't there.  They probably won't listen though. Ask for.their business plan to help you survive.\n\nIf she's that great, they can arrange.and pay for their own booth for her next time. Don't back down on that.\n\nMake it very clear that you will not tolerate them dismissing your art like that. They're disrespecting you. Keep repeating that", "NTA...it's your income. If you can't survive, you're no inspiration to anyone. Let them set up and pay for her own table and experience the boring side of the industry.", "NTA so hard. I don't think you needed to go off her art so hard, a simple \"but she's a kid\" would be enough, but let's look at why you're not an asshole:\n\nShe's basically being brought to your office. Not just your office, but your extremely important business meeting. No other job would it be acceptable to have an interrupting child present under such conditions just because she's \"interested in business\".\n\nYou lost income. I would pull up numbers from an earlier event, and print them out. Print out numbers from this event. Explain the costs and say you love her, and you're proud of her and believe in her, but that you will not compromise your career for this. Especially since she could learn from you, an artist, having firm boundaries. I'd also have a talk with her about how art is a real job and that if anyone tries ro tell her it's less than, they're wrong. That way she gains a healthy respect for an artists' time and is better mentally prepared for all the \"but can't you just design my tattoo for free?\" questions she'll be bombarded with if she decides to go the art route.", "NTA. This is your income. Next time they can get a table of their own, but far away from you.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re F-ing over your livelihood. That\u2019s not acceptable and if they do it a second time it could mean you end up homeless. You\u2019ve basically taken a massive pay cut this year to let this child cos-play as a commercial artist. The absolute entitlement of them.\n\nThey can book and pay for her own table. They can learn the real cost of selling.", "NTA. It was very nice of you to let her have a little space at your table in the first place and they completely abused that. It's not fair that you lost income because of that, I would ask for compensation.", "NTA. If she stayed on her side of the table and didn't actively steal and block your sales, it would've been different. This isn't about whose art is better, it's about your livelihood. If you budgeted that you'd get three months' rent out of this, and only broke even, what are you going to do now? Did they pay you for her spot? For the babysitting?\n\nThe fact that you're a better artist is just a straw man thrown in there to make you feel bad.", "NTA. These people have no idea how anything works, especially not art at cons. Ignore them. Don\u2019t let it happen again.", "NTA", "NTA and I would send them a bill for half the cost of the table.

Your nieces parents are seriously compromising that, which is all future income. So unless they going to pay you to patron their neice - hell no.\n\nThis is like if your uncle was a builder, his kid wanted to build furniture, tried it and was ok at it so they let him let loose in a workshop and tried to sell his pieces.\n\nDraw the line. Hold firm. Bugger what family says. Working in the arts family just don\u2019t get what it\u2019s like, and it can be really hard sometimes.\n\nAlso as an artist you don\u2019t just walk into comic con, and it\u2019s part of the journey to build your practice, work and reputation at smaller events.\n\nIF you\u2019re feeling generous I\u2019d compromise on a 45 lesson a week, and time capped help setting up your niece with her own brand/socials. And then she can treat it as a business. Which is a much more valued lesson.\nMoney in = money for materials / market stall set up and fees. \nIf it crashes, teach her how to analyse and adjust her work for what\u2019s selling and how to price it.\n\nThat\u2019s the skill set and real value you can share, and either her parents get that, or they don\u2019t.", "NTA maybe you have to show spreadsheets about how much money you lost last time", "NTA - you supported your niece and she and her parents prevented you from making a living.  \n\n\"She could do art fairs, easier stuff.

Seriously.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t about you invalidating your niece - this is about your niece and her parents sabotaging your career.

You suggested that she do the work to become an actual working artist, and they got mad that you don\u2019t provide her a shortcut. \n\nYou are not the AH here. And if her parents insist on you being a \u201crole model,\u201d then they need to subsidize your losses.", "NTA they can make her an etsy or something if they want to pursue selling her art. protect your livelihood and good luck!", "NTA\n\nYou are not responsible for your niece's development or career, especially at the cost of your full time source of income. You're also entirely within your rights to put boundaries on the kind of support you're willing or able to provide.\n\nHer parents were way out of line for blocking your table (which you paid for), and actively diverting potential customers away from your art.\n\nGiven that you're a professional in your field, maybe her parents should be grateful for any support/mentorship you're able to provide, and more willing to take your advice on what's acceptable/unacceptable in what is still a professional environment.\n\nIt might be worth setting some very strict boundaries/expectations before your next con, cause your niece's sales are never going to pay your rent.", "INFO: Is she your niece or your cousin?

This is your job, you rely on this income. Don't bring them again. Your niece should be focusing on learning and developing her art skills, not selling art - realistically people buying it are doing it for the 'aww' factor which won't last as she gets older and may leave her with an unrealistic idea of her commercial prospects and a lack of fundamental art skills. It will hurt her in the longterm, her parents should be helping her get a sense of achievement through seeing her skills improve, not counting on sales.", "NTA, ive sold at comicon tables too and i know its difficult, It's also your full time job, her parents can get their own table if they want to sell.", "NTA\n\nIf they're that confident then they can spend the money getting her a vendor space and paying the fee.", "NTA. Reading the headline I thought I'd say differently but yeah if they want her to have a table and representing at these type of events then they need to rent her own table. And truthfully, having parents doing pressure sales at a your table would keep me from going by your table even if I really wanted to see what you had/eat interested in purchasing.

This \\^\\^\\^", "I doubt it will work. The parents seems unfazed by reality. \nParents can the kid and set up their own table. This seems to be a grift. \n\nOP NTA obviously. Stand your ground. This is a grift from the parents. They see the money.", "She will be fine. It will be the best thing for her to hear the truth and understand how it all works. If you care about her progress you can set aside some personal time to show her how the business end works. Let her see you filling out and submitting an application (and payment). Explain your total cost, how much you need to make to make the weekend worth it, and what you need to do to set yourself up for maximum sales. You could even scout out smaller events that are geared toward kids (elementary schools often have craft fairs that are open to the community) and help her set up her own table, use her print sales from your event to pay for her admission and supplies, etc. go with her and help her run her table and show her how it\u2019s done. This poor girl", "They are just so incredibly entitled, my head hurts. I would respond in writing: \n\n\"You called me a \"psychopath\" for wanting to earn a living as a professional artist, and my work as not a \"real job\".  Fine. If that is how you perceive me and my work, know this: This \"psychopath\" will not be getting involved in promoting an 8-year-old's amateur efforts, because we all know how dangerous psychopaths are, especially when dealing with parents who lack reasonable boundaries and have no respect for other people or the work they do. I owe you nothing of my work opportunities and spaces, the costs and expenses I pay for exhibitions of MY work, or my time. I am only sorry for \\[niece\\] that you have taken what could have been a fun and fruitful childhood learning process for her, and turned it into raw exploitation - both of her and of me.\"", "They're irrational, so you can't win. You can't afford to lose sales, so that's that. Watch out for them showing up unannounced at the next convention trying to shoehorn your niece's work onto your table in front of an audient.", "That's such a ridiculous take, and it's so invalidating of the seriousness of your career. The fact that they thing what you have worked for years to do is the equivalent of a child's effort over a few months is silly.I'd suggest to give them some space. You don't owe your nibling anything, and her parents are boundary-stompers. It's clear that they think what you do isn't \"real\" work, if they think it can be easily replicated by a child. I have a kid who's doing an art business, and it's a butt-ton of work. It's way more than showing up with some prints and being cute. Parents are fobbing off ALL of that back-end stuff on you, and that's no bueno.Give yourself a break from their toxicity and enjoy the rest of your summer!", "At which point you simply stop trying to explain since they\u2019re not going to accept anything that isn\u2019t what they want. Because they\u2019d rather see you not being able to make rent and somehow think that she\u2019s now entitled to HALF of your projected earnings. As an 8 year old artist of a few months.\n\nIf they continue to bring it up, grey rock them. You owe them nothing further. You may have to deal with them turning up to these events and just happening to come by your table. Do not furnish them with any more of your income info, and do not tell them your plans.", "OP, seriously, stop trying to get them to understand your POV. There is absolutely nothing you can say or do to make them understand. They\u2019re unreasonable, and they don\u2019t care. You\u2019re fighting a losing battle. Just say \u201cno\u201d and end the conversation. I know that is hard, I\u2019ve been there. It will get easier with time. From my experience with similar people, the more you explain yourself the worse they view you.", "Easy replay. They pay you whatever you lost or they'll be the ones putting money ahead of their daughter.", "Honestly, no arguing with people like that. Psychopathic parents who think their little angels are the second coming of art Jesus. \n\nI\u2019d just stop talking to them altogether, don\u2019t talk about conventions coming up or anything \u2014 don\u2019t give them any opportunity to get involved.", "I'm afraid you'll have to disengage and go NC or LC for awhile. They sound exhausting.", "As someone else pointed out, there's also the issue of her being a minor. Most cons wouldn't allow someone that young to have table space at all. And many/most cons have a stipulation that in order to share a table, the other artist must go through the process and be accepted by the con. AND, as the primary on the table, you would be responsible for anything going wrong.", "I get that. But I'm saying it'd be a nonstarter with the people OP is dealing with. They'll say they didn't use more than half the space the whole time when they already don't feel like they owe her shit", "And adjust historical figures for inflation.", "It undermines OP's point.  If this was any other job it would be clear it was nobody's business how much they lost, it should be enough that it's her booth for her business and she said it hurt her financially.  If she was selling aluminum siding nobody would be expecting that kind of info.  So I do understand why she hasn't said anything about how much she lost, and you have to also keep in mind that they would use that info to extrapolate a lot more about her total income.  What she has already said is more than enough: \"no.\"", "Best reply here, IMO.", "It's worse that that. They think that OP owes them for travel expenses plus \"bringing in business\". They're a couple of idiotic narcissists.", "OP mentioned that her neice would not get accepted at these cons.  The child does not yet have the skill to be allocated a table.", "yeah, what could go wrong???", "What kind of admin stuff does your bird help with? I just got chicks and would love to put them to work when they aren't eating insects and laying eggs. They won't be very busy when there is snow on the ground.", "That's so great. What kind of bird?", "I'm assuming you didn't say this directly to that child's face. If so, then I think you do need to apologize *to her* for being mean *to her* in how you said it. Not because you're wrong, but because this situation is not her fault. (But to be clear, your apology is for saying that she's not very good yet, not for not wanting her to go to cons with you and sell her stuff there. Emphasize that you're sure she'll be good *later*.)\n\nWith that said, you're NTA. Let her parents sort out her events. It's not your job to do it. If they weren't so awful I'd suggest getting her an art class for her birthday, but as they *are* awful I think that might just encourage the parents to be awful some more.\n\nEdit: I'm thinking about this - \n\n> They argue I should be a role model, I'm jealous of the attention, I'm afraid of the 'competition', I'm selfish for thinking I'm better etc. \n\nNext time you're in a situation like this one, try leaning into it. \"You're right, Aunt Dymphna, I am jealous of her. I'm glad you understand.\" \"You think I'm selfish? Yes, that seems about right. I'm very selfish, and that's why she can't come.\" Try to say it with sincerity, like you're not being sarcastic at all. In my experience, people have no idea what to do with this sort of response, and they tend to just fizzle out. Even if they don't, agreeing with them on every point can be really funny so long as you remember the goal.", "Gate keeper much?", "It's their child, not yours. You don't need to do more than being nice and polite. Even the lessons you're giving her are extras that you aren't obligated to do. Cut the ties, you'll be able to make peace with your niece when she's older. \nThis toxic family doesn't deserve you. Once they'll learn to have respect and really see you as a person and not a means for their interests, they can be family again.", "1. All this sounds harmful to your niece. She should not be taught to compare herself or to chase likes.\n\n2. Do *not* teach her anything. The parents can put her in art class. You need to disengage from the parents.", "Sweetie, there\u2019s no compromise with these people, they haven\u2019t listened to you up to now, there\u2019s not going to be a magic phrase that will turn them into decent people who\u2019ll hear what you\u2019re saying. Stop interacting over this, grey rock them. Good luck!", "Just reply back. \n\nYou: Ohh thank you for offering to pay my rent, I greatly appreciate it.\n\nThem: umm no what do you mean. \n\nYou: well your asking me to give up my income to help niece so I assumed that ment you would be supplementing my income for me to be able to do this. \n\nThem: No\n\nYou: ohh so I'm the only one giving up something to help niece out. I see you happy when I make the sacrifices that affect my livelihood but your not willing to help with the support to do so. \n\nThem.  . .. .  \n\nYou: So you agree taking nice to smaller shows that don't affect my ability to live and pay my rent is a better idea as well? \n\nIf the answer is anything but yes we agree. Then they can f off. Supporting your niece is great and all but it shouldn't be at tour expense. Art developes as your grow up. If you compared your current art now to what you did at 8 years old it would be worlds apart. Your niece need the time and support and experience to get to where you are. \n\nHer parents don't want her to have to sacrifice and go through the hard times to get to where you are. They just want you to give it to them. \n\nAlso is there a chance if they were to continue taking over your booth selling sub par material that doesn't meet their standards you would not be allowed to return??", "Your family is going to kill her love of art before she even develops it, it's absolutely bat shit. As a hopefully former con artist (the money is good it's hard to quit, i know exactly how you feel lol) we all have some fucked up relationships with art and that family is putting her on the fast track to needing therapy smh.", "You can't reason with some people because they lack the mental faculties to process the information being presented to them. \n\nNTA. This is your work. If they want her at conventions they can foot the bill for the table and whatever else and she can have her own space overseen by her parents so you can actually work. Your niece's parents sound absolutely insufferable.", "A) great username\n\nB) great points. I'd still offer there's some kind of middle ground as I understand OP wants to support the kiddo, and being able to actually sell art for money is a huge deal for kids. Maybe the smaller art shows are it. I totally agree the parents are out of line calling OP a \"gatekeeper\". That's silly for a 9 year old. \n\nAlso agree with you the option to pay anything back is a bad idea with too much room for additional problems. Maybe that's part of the upfront cost for this other family - hours to plan and set up for additional space?\n\nOP is an artist and very creative. There's a good chance they'll come up with something that works for them. \ud83d\ude0a", "Lol he stays and keeps me company when I'm like sending emails and updating accounts and stuff.
