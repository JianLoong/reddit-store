You love her but this is your livelihood. Show them the income gap to make your rent now. Also draw a stick figure flow diagram showing how they blocked the traffic to the table. Calculate the % jump in sales the day they weren't there.  They probably won't listen though. Ask for.their business plan to help you survive.\n\nIf she's that great, they can arrange.and pay for their own booth for her next time. Don't back down on that.\n\nMake it very clear that you will not tolerate them dismissing your art like that. They're disrespecting you. Keep repeating that", "NTA...it's your income. If you can't survive, you're no inspiration to anyone. Let them set up and pay for her own table and experience the boring side of the industry.", "NTA so hard. I don't think you needed to go off her art so hard, a simple \"but she's a kid\" would be enough, but let's look at why you're not an asshole:\n\nShe's basically being brought to your office. Not just your office, but your extremely important business meeting. No other job would it be acceptable to have an interrupting child present under such conditions just because she's \"interested in business\".\n\nYou lost income. I would pull up numbers from an earlier event, and print them out. Print out numbers from this event. Explain the costs and say you love her, and you're proud of her and believe in her, but that you will not compromise your career for this. Especially since she could learn from you, an artist, having firm boundaries. I'd also have a talk with her about how art is a real job and that if anyone tries ro tell her it's less than, they're wrong. That way she gains a healthy respect for an artists' time and is better mentally prepared for all the \"but can't you just design my tattoo for free?\" questions she'll be bombarded with if she decides to go the art route.", "NTA. This is your income. Next time they can get a table of their own, but far away from you.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re F-ing over your livelihood. That\u2019s not acceptable and if they do it a second time it could mean you end up homeless. You\u2019ve basically taken a massive pay cut this year to let this child cos-play as a commercial artist. The absolute entitlement of them.\n\nThey can book and pay for her own table. They can learn the real cost of selling.", "NTA. It was very nice of you to let her have a little space at your table in the first place and they completely abused that. It's not fair that you lost income because of that, I would ask for compensation.", "NTA. If she stayed on her side of the table and didn't actively steal and block your sales, it would've been different. This isn't about whose art is better, it's about your livelihood. If you budgeted that you'd get three months' rent out of this, and only broke even, what are you going to do now? Did they pay you for her spot? For the babysitting?\n\nThe fact that you're a better artist is just a straw man thrown in there to make you feel bad.", "NTA. These people have no idea how anything works, especially not art at cons. Ignore them. Don\u2019t let it happen again.", "NTA", "NTA and I would send them a bill for half the cost of the table.

Go ahead and piss them off.", "NTA - you not only lost the time you invested you lost income equivalent to 3 months rent! And 50% of been an artist these days is branding and engagement. Your nieces parents are seriously compromising that, which is all future income. So unless they going to pay you to patron their neice - hell no.\n\nThis is like if your uncle was a builder, his kid wanted to build furniture, tried it and was ok at it so they let him let loose in a workshop and tried to sell his pieces.\n\nDraw the line. Hold firm. Bugger what family says. Working in the arts family just don\u2019t get what it\u2019s like, and it can be really hard sometimes.\n\nAlso as an artist you don\u2019t just walk into comic con, and it\u2019s part of the journey to build your practice, work and reputation at smaller events.\n\nIF you\u2019re feeling generous I\u2019d compromise on a 45 lesson a week, and time capped help setting up your niece with her own brand/socials. And then she can treat it as a business. Which is a much more valued lesson.\nMoney in = money for materials / market stall set up and fees. \nIf it crashes, teach her how to analyse and adjust her work for what\u2019s selling and how to price it.\n\nThat\u2019s the skill set and real value you can share, and either her parents get that, or they don\u2019t.", "NTA maybe you have to show spreadsheets about how much money you lost last time", "NTA - you supported your niece and she and her parents prevented you from making a living.  \n\n\"She could do art fairs, easier stuff.

Seriously.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t about you invalidating your niece - this is about your niece and her parents sabotaging your career. If they want her to sell her art at the convention, perhaps they should pay for a booth at the convention themselves so they can see what it takes to *actually* run a business as an artist. \n\nYou aren\u2019t her role model - you are running a business and trying to make a living, and they are actively sabotaging that. You suggested that she do the work to become an actual working artist, and they got mad that you don\u2019t provide her a shortcut. \n\nYou are not the AH here. And if her parents insist on you being a \u201crole model,\u201d then they need to subsidize your losses.", "NTA they can make her an etsy or something if they want to pursue selling her art. protect your livelihood and good luck!", "NTA\n\nYou are not responsible for your niece's development or career, especially at the cost of your full time source of income. You're also entirely within your rights to put boundaries on the kind of support you're willing or able to provide.\n\nHer parents were way out of line for blocking your table (which you paid for), and actively diverting potential customers away from your art.\n\nGiven that you're a professional in your field, maybe her parents should be grateful for any support/mentorship you're able to provide, and more willing to take your advice on what's acceptable/unacceptable in what is still a professional environment.\n\nIt might be worth setting some very strict boundaries/expectations before your next con, cause your niece's sales are never going to pay your rent.", "INFO: Is she your niece or your cousin? If she\u2019s your niece, her parents wouldn\u2019t be your aunt and uncle.", "Shouldn\u2019t have even posted cause this isn\u2019t even debatable NTA", "NTA - I'm an artist. This is your job, you rely on this income. Don't bring them again. Your niece should be focusing on learning and developing her art skills, not selling art - realistically people buying it are doing it for the 'aww' factor which won't last as she gets older and may leave her with an unrealistic idea of her commercial prospects and a lack of fundamental art skills. It will hurt her in the longterm, her parents should be helping her get a sense of achievement through seeing her skills improve, not counting on sales.", "NTA, ive sold at comicon tables too and i know its difficult, It's also your full time job, her parents can get their own table if they want to sell.", "NTA\n\nIf they're that confident then they can spend the money getting her a vendor space and paying the fee.", "NTA. Reading the headline I thought I'd say differently but yeah if they want her to have a table and representing at these type of events then they need to rent her own table. And truthfully, having parents doing pressure sales at a your table would keep me from going by your table even if I really wanted to see what you had/eat interested in purchasing.

Send them the booth applications and tell them if they want to sell her artwork they can pay for a space like the rest of the artists.\n\nAlso warn them that you'd be willing to compromise and give her art the same space you did last year but if they behave the same way you would not hesitate to get security to escort them out for harassment.", "Charge them for table space.", "NTA at all, your livelihood is at stake here", "NTA,\n\nHonestly, it's very annoying when people think that drawing and the hard work that goes into art. I'm sorry you lost money, tbh you should've shut it down after the first day, OR if your wanted to \"compromise\" tell her she could set up on the last / slowest day so you had your opportunity to make your sales.\n\nArt takes time. **Alot** of time and I think because people only see the end product/ don't really see the process they think it's easy.\n\nI have self taught myself how to draw and have gotten really good at it, damn good. But it was years of practice. And I would **never** pull some shit like on that on someone, especially if it was there source of income.\n\nTbh I would take a huge step back. Tell them you can offer advice here and there, but disengage. She can put in the work to build her portfolio, you have no obligation to build her following, if she gets good at it her following will grow naturally.\n\nYou would be TAH to yourself if you let them walk over you again.", "Tell them to buy their own table, you can't spare the space.

A kid has no business being at something as taxing as a comics convention all weekend, let alone fucking SELLING ANYTHING.\n\nAdditionally, they wouldn\u2019t pull this at a fuckin\u2019 car dealership or whatever. They\u2019re doing it because they don\u2019t take this industry or arts seriously and see your job as comparable to a child\u2019s hobby.\n\nYour family are idiots who just want to show off their kid at your expense. Put your foot down, block them, and die on this hill- you have rent to pay. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour family can think what it wants. Even just being a *congoer* is expensive at conventions, and they forced you to foot the bill so their daughter could have some little kid fun. Now they're expecting to take over more of your table? That's a bridge too far. If they wanna spotlight your niece they need to **spotlight some funds from their own wallet.**", "NTA, I'm familiar with the artist alley table games you gotta play at these cons in order to make money. I'm surprised you didn't put your foot down harder mid-first day. This is your livelihood on the line.\n\nEdited to add, you were also super kind to offer to take her to smaller events, and they should have taken you up on the offer of they were smart.", "NTA.  It's your income at stake and you can't let that suffer for someone else's whims.  Sometimes family sucks.", "NTA... they should show concern for your livelihood because that is what supportive people do.

How if they were in my shoes they wouldn't be 'selfish' like me and would share the platform\n\nSimultaneously an art career is nothing when it's mine, everything when it's hers. Her work is so good that the only reason I might not want her to share is because she outshines me, yet at the same time she needs me because they know she can't succeed with her skillset\n\nThey want me to pull her up to my level here and now but even if I had that power she's literally not ready", "You're right honestly, line drawn, spine slowly growing\n\nSince the argument with her parents I've been bombarded with angry messages from extended family and it got my head in a spin even though I thought I was in the right\n\nThey all think I've got my head up my own ass about being an *artiste* (they're all STEM) to the point that I was willing to be shitty to a child and I was sort of terrified they were right", "They spent money on travel, tickets, hotel, and keep implying that I owe them compensation for their 'help'", "The literal hundreds of sweary messages from my extended family disagree\n\nI think they're seeing it as me being selfish and picking a fight with an 8yo and them choosing her side, so this post is more of a 'I'm not being shitty to this child, right?'", "Sorry I clarified in another comment, I think she's technically my halfstepcousin? No blood relation but her stepfather is my half uncle, with the 22 year age gap between me and her she calls me auntie, and the family usually refers to her as 'the little one' or 'little baby'. 'Niece' felt like the best way to explain the dynamic without bogging down the post with a family tree", "they've spent so much money on her, tablets and programs and supplies I can't afford, I think they think that they've 'given their part' so now I have to 'give mine'\n\nEveryone has to pitch in for the little shining star of the family and I'm the bad egg for not doing so", "That's up to them, though. There's nothing wrong with explaining to her that this is your way of making money and taking her was a one time exception. An eight year old can understand that. If somebody tells her you won't take her because her art is bad, that's cruel, but still not your fault.", "You need to tell your family and the niece how much of a financial hit you took.\n\nI'm guessing you didn't make it clear how much money, in actual dollar terms, they cost you.", "You could say, \"I'll give you the contact information to sign up for a table of your own!

It will just make them angry. It doesn't matter in this discussion anyway, if your niece was a genius she would mess up your sales anyway.\n\n\nYou have a valid point about the cons being your main income and essential part of your job. You have clearly lost income, and your time, attention and space at the table has a measurable monetary value.  That's more than enough arguments. Repeat like a broken record: \"I love helping my niece, but not in the wayst that cost me [the exact amount]. That's enough, and that's clear enough so they won't be able to turn it against you (I hope). If anyone shames you for that, suggest them that they could repay you the said amount. What they are pushing on you is downright insulting, and the way they stick to it despite the knowing the impact it had on you is malicious.\n\n\n(Also, check if there are rules about sharing a table at the convention. If it's not allowed, then, that's another argument. If it's allowed, then you can buy another table just for the niece - providing that the family will pay a full price for it, and the niece won't be your responsibility. If they manage to do that, accidentally buy them a table far away from yours)", "That's fine - it's up to them. Do not allow them to use your space, if they try, get the convention security to make them leave.\n\nThis is your livelihood. This is how you make money. Either you get serious about it, or you no longer have a life.\n\nThey will try to manipulate you - they already have. But if you are not willing to stand up for your job, you won't have one.", "you don't have to tell them about the  upcoming conventions right?", "As an artist who tables at cons as well- she is a minor and not allowed to table at conventions at all. Print and show those regulations to the parents, you have to be either 16+ to be at an artist alley, at least where I am. Tell them that you are not risking your job to break the rules as it is illegal.", "That\u2019s the whole point. She wouldn\u2019t qualify. She doesn\u2019t qualify. She can\u2019t get her own table at the convention.  Sooooo she\u2019s not getting a table at the convention. \nJust like I\u2019m not getting a table at the convention and my neighbor isn\u2019t getting a table and dude over there isn\u2019t getting a table and\u2026\u2026.\nThere\u2019s a process to getting a table and she can do the process. Oh, she can\u2019t do the process? Then she doesn\u2019t get a table. We are going in circles here. See? \n\nLogical thing would be to show her parents your numbers- your earnings on day one, day two, and day three. Show them the difference it made in your income when she was at your table. \nHowever, it doesn\u2019t sound like they are logical people . They would think you\u2019re being \u201call about money\u201d (well, yeah?) and it may not get you anywhere. \nBut you can at least show yourself those numbers and remind yourself \u2014- NTA !!!", "Then tough luck for them. There's a reason she won't get a table.  NTA but put your foot down. \n\nTell the to give you  the complete sum you made last year  cash in hand before going and you will refund everything you sell with them there -they can even keep score.", "Perhaps this is just my cynical speculation, but maybe they\u2019re hoping that being at a larger event like this will increase her likelihood of coming to the attention of a celebrity. One word on social media by someone like Tom Holland about the enterprising young artist he met at ComicCon and the next thing you know your niece is financing mommy and daddy\u2019s shiny new lifestyle. That may be why starting at smaller art fairs is unacceptable to them.", "I think you're right, she really needs to be more at local art shows, etc. Those tend to have more of a laissez-faire attitude with how they run. I would imagine in a setting like this (I'm guessing it's a ticketed event?) people probably don't have the patience for that. I doubt I would (unless there's wine involved).", "You\u2019re totally in the right. Did you tell them you usually makes three months of rent here and that if their daughter is going to cut into that, they need to make it up for you?", "Do not open that door. What if they do give you money to offset the expenses? Then you\u2019re back to the shitshow that was your last con. You really need to shut this down firmly and leave no opening for any kind of discussion or compromise. \u2018No. Niece/cousin cannot promote, display or sell at my table. If you attempt any of this, you will be escorted away by security\u2019. End of story. Rinse lather repeat. You cannot risk your reputation and financial safety. Good luck.", "I love the idea of the spread sheet showing what you invested. They either pay 50% of all costs from the last event or there is zero discussion going forward, even helping her with smaller events. They need to see this is a profession and takes so much effort.", "You barely broke even on an event you usually make three months rent at, NTA. It's not like you sat a child down and told her her art sucks! And it sounds like it doesn't suck, but is far from professional which is the standard required at the cons you're attending. You don't set this expectation the people running the cons do.", "Except that your niece and her parents blocked your potential customers from buying your art.  Huge difference.", "No one under the age of 14/15 should be working these cons and even then that's very young for the pressure.", "You're going to need to be very blunt. No, you cannot use my table again. You may have to get convention security to remove them if they get in the way.", "If anything they should be billed for the lost income\u2026", "Be proud that you have talent, the world needs artists and sounds like you're a pretty successful one too if you're able to pay bills on it. Any extended family that complains just ask them if they'll cover your rent instead and if they dont take the hint, block them. keep building that spine, you can do it!", "I do small, local events with my art. People are allowed to visit and hang out with me but they are not allowed to talk to me while a potential customer is in the vicinity and they are definitely not allowed to stand in front of my table. It feels mean but I just imagine that if I was a customer I would just walk right on by without it, just as you saw.", "You\u2019re NTA. If I were you I\u2019d put them in their place.

I\u2019d say they\u2019ll start backing off then. \n\nIf they won\u2019t drop it then tell them you\u2019re done talking about it.

I share it sometimes (just to my feed or story) and it tanks my engagement. One 'my little niece drew this, isn't it lovely' is received great, every day gets old really fast\n\nThey know how much I make at ComicCon and I know they expected that amount to just fall into their laps by attending", "Skip the lie. How many endless hours have you worked to be able to obtain this spot at conventions? Assuming a lot. \n\nThey are piggybacking on your success to elevate their daughter and make money.

Well if she can\u2019t get a booth off her own merit, why should she have a spot?\n\nDid anyone put you up on display at their booths and sacrifice months worth of income for you?
