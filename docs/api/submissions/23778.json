It's your occupation, your income. They're being inconsiderate and selfish.\n\nYou could show them a $ table of your expenses and net income at the event with and without adorable niece. You love her but this is your livelihood. Show them the income gap to make your rent now. Also draw a stick figure flow diagram showing how they blocked the traffic to the table. Calculate the % jump in sales the day they weren't there.  They probably won't listen though. Ask for.their business plan to help you survive.\n\nIf she's that great, they can arrange.and pay for their own booth for her next time. Don't back down on that.\n\nMake it very clear that you will not tolerate them dismissing your art like that. They're disrespecting you. Keep repeating that", "NTA...it's your income. If you can't survive, you're no inspiration to anyone. Let them set up and pay for her own table and experience the boring side of the industry.", "NTA so hard. I don't think you needed to go off her art so hard, a simple \"but she's a kid\" would be enough, but let's look at why you're not an asshole:\n\nShe's basically being brought to your office. Not just your office, but your extremely important business meeting. No other job would it be acceptable to have an interrupting child present under such conditions just because she's \"interested in business\".\n\nYou lost income. I would pull up numbers from an earlier event, and print them out. Print out numbers from this event. Explain the costs and say you love her, and you're proud of her and believe in her, but that you will not compromise your career for this. Especially since she could learn from you, an artist, having firm boundaries. I'd also have a talk with her about how art is a real job and that if anyone tries ro tell her it's less than, they're wrong. That way she gains a healthy respect for an artists' time and is better mentally prepared for all the \"but can't you just design my tattoo for free?\" questions she'll be bombarded with if she decides to go the art route.", "NTA. This is your income. Next time they can get a table of their own, but far away from you.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re F-ing over your livelihood. That\u2019s not acceptable and if they do it a second time it could mean you end up homeless. You\u2019ve basically taken a massive pay cut this year to let this child cos-play as a commercial artist. The absolute entitlement of them.\n\nThey can book and pay for her own table. They can learn the real cost of selling.", "NTA. It was very nice of you to let her have a little space at your table in the first place and they completely abused that. It's not fair that you lost income because of that, I would ask for compensation.", "NTA. If she stayed on her side of the table and didn't actively steal and block your sales, it would've been different. This isn't about whose art is better, it's about your livelihood. If you budgeted that you'd get three months' rent out of this, and only broke even, what are you going to do now? Did they pay you for her spot? For the babysitting?\n\nThe fact that you're a better artist is just a straw man thrown in there to make you feel bad.", "NTA. These people have no idea how anything works, especially not art at cons. Ignore them. Don\u2019t let it happen again.", "NTA", "NTA and I would send them a bill for half the cost of the table. Stop trying to cling to these relationships. Your sister is awful, her husband is awful, and that kid isn\u2019t going to turn out well either. Go ahead and piss them off.", "NTA - you not only lost the time you invested you lost income equivalent to 3 months rent! And 50% of been an artist these days is branding and engagement. Your nieces parents are seriously compromising that, which is all future income. So unless they going to pay you to patron their neice - hell no.\n\nThis is like if your uncle was a builder, his kid wanted to build furniture, tried it and was ok at it so they let him let loose in a workshop and tried to sell his pieces.\n\nDraw the line. Hold firm. Bugger what family says. Working in the arts family just don\u2019t get what it\u2019s like, and it can be really hard sometimes.\n\nAlso as an artist you don\u2019t just walk into comic con, and it\u2019s part of the journey to build your practice, work and reputation at smaller events.\n\nIF you\u2019re feeling generous I\u2019d compromise on a 45 lesson a week, and time capped help setting up your niece with her own brand/socials. And then she can treat it as a business. Which is a much more valued lesson.\nMoney in = money for materials / market stall set up and fees. \nIf it crashes, teach her how to analyse and adjust her work for what\u2019s selling and how to price it.\n\nThat\u2019s the skill set and real value you can share, and either her parents get that, or they don\u2019t.", "NTA maybe you have to show spreadsheets about how much money you lost last time", "NTA - you supported your niece and she and her parents prevented you from making a living.  \n\n\"She could do art fairs, easier stuff. I offered to take her to small events but that enraged them (how dare I gatekeep)\"\n\nThey don't want to accept that you had to work your way up so your niece will have to as well as her art improves.", "NTA - if this is a true story then your family is just weird. Seriously.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t about you invalidating your niece - this is about your niece and her parents sabotaging your career. If they want her to sell her art at the convention, perhaps they should pay for a booth at the convention themselves so they can see what it takes to *actually* run a business as an artist. \n\nYou aren\u2019t her role model - you are running a business and trying to make a living, and they are actively sabotaging that. You suggested that she do the work to become an actual working artist, and they got mad that you don\u2019t provide her a shortcut. \n\nYou are not the AH here. And if her parents insist on you being a \u201crole model,\u201d then they need to subsidize your losses.", "NTA they can make her an etsy or something if they want to pursue selling her art. protect your livelihood and good luck!", "NTA\n\nYou are not responsible for your niece's development or career, especially at the cost of your full time source of income. You're also entirely within your rights to put boundaries on the kind of support you're willing or able to provide.\n\nHer parents were way out of line for blocking your table (which you paid for), and actively diverting potential customers away from your art.\n\nGiven that you're a professional in your field, maybe her parents should be grateful for any support/mentorship you're able to provide, and more willing to take your advice on what's acceptable/unacceptable in what is still a professional environment.\n\nIt might be worth setting some very strict boundaries/expectations before your next con, cause your niece's sales are never going to pay your rent.", "INFO: Is she your niece or your cousin? If she\u2019s your niece, her parents wouldn\u2019t be your aunt and uncle.", "Shouldn\u2019t have even posted cause this isn\u2019t even debatable NTA", "NTA - I'm an artist. This is your job, you rely on this income. Don't bring them again. Your niece should be focusing on learning and developing her art skills, not selling art - realistically people buying it are doing it for the 'aww' factor which won't last as she gets older and may leave her with an unrealistic idea of her commercial prospects and a lack of fundamental art skills. It will hurt her in the longterm, her parents should be helping her get a sense of achievement through seeing her skills improve, not counting on sales.", "NTA, ive sold at comicon tables too and i know its difficult, It's also your full time job, her parents can get their own table if they want to sell.", "NTA\n\nIf they're that confident then they can spend the money getting her a vendor space and paying the fee.", "NTA. Reading the headline I thought I'd say differently but yeah if they want her to have a table and representing at these type of events then they need to rent her own table. And truthfully, having parents doing pressure sales at a your table would keep me from going by your table even if I really wanted to see what you had/eat interested in purchasing. I hate pressure sales like this especially when kids are involved. I think it's dirty and a little smarmy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did they open her her own account or get her her own piggybank for the money?", "NTA, it's your table and you shouldn't have to babysit while working. \n\nI think it's nice you wanna take her to smaller events and it's a good way for her to learn. \n\nMaybe you could tell the family you want to run the table alone, but will put some of her art on it for sale?

I have friends (adults) come and help me at big events sometimes, and even they burn out and get overwhelmed. I take a couple of days off after cons because of the mental stress, and yet they want to push a literal child into that experience?
