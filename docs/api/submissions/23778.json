You love her but this is your livelihood. Show them the income gap to make your rent now. Also draw a stick figure flow diagram showing how they blocked the traffic to the table. Calculate the % jump in sales the day they weren't there.  They probably won't listen though. Ask for.their business plan to help you survive.\n\nIf she's that great, they can arrange.and pay for their own booth for her next time. Don't back down on that.\n\nMake it very clear that you will not tolerate them dismissing your art like that. They're disrespecting you. Keep repeating that", "NTA...it's your income. If you can't survive, you're no inspiration to anyone. Let them set up and pay for her own table and experience the boring side of the industry.", "NTA so hard. I don't think you needed to go off her art so hard, a simple \"but she's a kid\" would be enough, but let's look at why you're not an asshole:\n\nShe's basically being brought to your office. Not just your office, but your extremely important business meeting. No other job would it be acceptable to have an interrupting child present under such conditions just because she's \"interested in business\".\n\nYou lost income. I would pull up numbers from an earlier event, and print them out. Print out numbers from this event. Explain the costs and say you love her, and you're proud of her and believe in her, but that you will not compromise your career for this. Especially since she could learn from you, an artist, having firm boundaries. I'd also have a talk with her about how art is a real job and that if anyone tries ro tell her it's less than, they're wrong. That way she gains a healthy respect for an artists' time and is better mentally prepared for all the \"but can't you just design my tattoo for free?\" questions she'll be bombarded with if she decides to go the art route.", "NTA. This is your income. Next time they can get a table of their own, but far away from you.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re F-ing over your livelihood. That\u2019s not acceptable and if they do it a second time it could mean you end up homeless. You\u2019ve basically taken a massive pay cut this year to let this child cos-play as a commercial artist. The absolute entitlement of them.\n\nThey can book and pay for her own table. They can learn the real cost of selling.", "NTA. It was very nice of you to let her have a little space at your table in the first place and they completely abused that. It's not fair that you lost income because of that, I would ask for compensation.", "NTA. If she stayed on her side of the table and didn't actively steal and block your sales, it would've been different. This isn't about whose art is better, it's about your livelihood. If you budgeted that you'd get three months' rent out of this, and only broke even, what are you going to do now? Did they pay you for her spot? For the babysitting?\n\nThe fact that you're a better artist is just a straw man thrown in there to make you feel bad.", "NTA. These people have no idea how anything works, especially not art at cons. Ignore them. Don\u2019t let it happen again.", "NTA", "NTA and I would send them a bill for half the cost of the table.

Go ahead and piss them off.", "NTA - you not only lost the time you invested you lost income equivalent to 3 months rent! And 50% of been an artist these days is branding and engagement. Your nieces parents are seriously compromising that, which is all future income. So unless they going to pay you to patron their neice - hell no.\n\nThis is like if your uncle was a builder, his kid wanted to build furniture, tried it and was ok at it so they let him let loose in a workshop and tried to sell his pieces.\n\nDraw the line. Hold firm. Bugger what family says. Working in the arts family just don\u2019t get what it\u2019s like, and it can be really hard sometimes.\n\nAlso as an artist you don\u2019t just walk into comic con, and it\u2019s part of the journey to build your practice, work and reputation at smaller events.\n\nIF you\u2019re feeling generous I\u2019d compromise on a 45 lesson a week, and time capped help setting up your niece with her own brand/socials. And then she can treat it as a business. Which is a much more valued lesson.\nMoney in = money for materials / market stall set up and fees. \nIf it crashes, teach her how to analyse and adjust her work for what\u2019s selling and how to price it.\n\nThat\u2019s the skill set and real value you can share, and either her parents get that, or they don\u2019t.", "NTA maybe you have to show spreadsheets about how much money you lost last time", "NTA - you supported your niece and she and her parents prevented you from making a living.  \n\n\"She could do art fairs, easier stuff.

Seriously.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t about you invalidating your niece - this is about your niece and her parents sabotaging your career. If they want her to sell her art at the convention, perhaps they should pay for a booth at the convention themselves so they can see what it takes to *actually* run a business as an artist. \n\nYou aren\u2019t her role model - you are running a business and trying to make a living, and they are actively sabotaging that. You suggested that she do the work to become an actual working artist, and they got mad that you don\u2019t provide her a shortcut. \n\nYou are not the AH here. And if her parents insist on you being a \u201crole model,\u201d then they need to subsidize your losses.", "NTA they can make her an etsy or something if they want to pursue selling her art. protect your livelihood and good luck!", "NTA\n\nYou are not responsible for your niece's development or career, especially at the cost of your full time source of income. You're also entirely within your rights to put boundaries on the kind of support you're willing or able to provide.\n\nHer parents were way out of line for blocking your table (which you paid for), and actively diverting potential customers away from your art.\n\nGiven that you're a professional in your field, maybe her parents should be grateful for any support/mentorship you're able to provide, and more willing to take your advice on what's acceptable/unacceptable in what is still a professional environment.\n\nIt might be worth setting some very strict boundaries/expectations before your next con, cause your niece's sales are never going to pay your rent.", "INFO: Is she your niece or your cousin?

This is your job, you rely on this income. Don't bring them again. Your niece should be focusing on learning and developing her art skills, not selling art - realistically people buying it are doing it for the 'aww' factor which won't last as she gets older and may leave her with an unrealistic idea of her commercial prospects and a lack of fundamental art skills. It will hurt her in the longterm, her parents should be helping her get a sense of achievement through seeing her skills improve, not counting on sales.", "NTA, ive sold at comicon tables too and i know its difficult, It's also your full time job, her parents can get their own table if they want to sell.", "NTA\n\nIf they're that confident then they can spend the money getting her a vendor space and paying the fee.", "NTA. Reading the headline I thought I'd say differently but yeah if they want her to have a table and representing at these type of events then they need to rent her own table. And truthfully, having parents doing pressure sales at a your table would keep me from going by your table even if I really wanted to see what you had/eat interested in purchasing.

It's a stressful weekend for you, not a fun time to hang out with your niece.", "Honestly, if that\u2019s the way they are behaving ? They aren\u2019t acknowledging the real problem because they don\u2019t want to and don\u2019t care. \n\nPeople who are ok with you not being able to pay your rent aren\u2019t people you need to take seriously.", "Let them know you will be happy to give her a spot at the con if they pay you the difference. A price tag might change their tone. And try to avoid talking about nieces skill level", "That sounds like weaponized incompetence. They know why you have an issue with what they\u2019re doing. Sounds like they just don\u2019t care. \n\nTime to stop arguing, give them a flat \u201cno\u201d and tell them to drop it. If THEY want to support the child they can buy her a table and do all these things themselves for her. If they aren\u2019t willing to do it themselves then you should not be compromising your work for her.", "It's time to stop discussing it then. They are not reasonable people. You do not need them to agree with you. No is a complete sentence.  It is no longer up for debate. NTA", "Tell them that if they pay you the difference between what you made at the show last year up front that you'll take her. You'll then reimburse them whatever manage to you earn whilst baby sitting your niece and giving her the benefit of your mentoring. If they're not willing to do that, then you're not willing to provide your skills. Then just tell the conversation is over.\n\nThen every time the try to communicate with you about it reply by texting \"It is your responsibility as her parents to inspire niece and pay for any associated costs. I WILL NOT risk my livelihood to mentor niece. This decision is final and will not change. I'm also no longer willing to provide any help or advice at all going forward, as YOU cannot respect my boundaries, so YOU have now ruined this for niece. You can stop asking me now, as the answer is, and will continue to be NO!\"", "Ok I'm gonna say somehting else. Your family obviously doesn't care about your life. So you should stop caring about what they think of your life", "Send them a bill for the difference and take them to court over the matter.  If money is not important, they shouldn't be hesitant to pay.  Or do they not love their daughter?  Or maybe they just want others to sacrifice for her, but not themselves?", "If they would say stuff like that, they are already incredibly toxic people. Just remember, you are an adult, you don\u2019t have to take that treatment, and you can just go LC or NC until they sort out their priorities\u2014or longer because it sounds like they pull this crap often. \n\nNTA. As another artist that has relied on Artist Alley money to pay the bills, I wish you all the good luck! \n\nLastly, Christmas without family can be the most amazing thing ever. First, you can avoid all the greedy shopping drama. Next, mull some wine, make a nice  dinner, watch some good shows, and enjoy the peace and quiet.", "I am sure you love your family and that this is very difficult to handle emotionally. However it appears that you are putting in more effort and understanding for them, than they are to you. I imagine part of why you struggle to stand up for yourself against them is this dynamic. It is painful and I am sorry this is how they respond to your valid concerns. I recommend that if you can afford it, finding a therapist to talk you through navigating family events like this will do you a world of good.   \nChristmas is important to many people, however, I have had the most relaxing and enjoyable holiday experiences when not attending (just food for thought). Exchange gifts and celebrations with people you know support you, not those who would leverage time together at celebrations against you. I will be thinking about you OP and I hope in future that things become easier for you.", "Block Them on Social Media Aunts uncle and co", "Just stand up for yourself. You're at work, not hosting", "Sounds like what you really need is to block them on social media.", "Nta. If you can't bring yourself to tell them the truth, show them this post. \n\nI'm sure the niece is talented for her age and cute, but you are running a business. Your sibling and sibling-in-law seem pushy to the extreme to try to force you to share your table without any compensation. \n\n Or, if you really want some more amenable solutions:\n \n If it smooths ruffled feathers maybe you could say that your niece is so cute that it's distracting people from buying anything. \n\nOR\n\nYou could put a few of your niece's pieces on your table (without them in attendance and with a clear sign saying these aren't your pieces and were drawn by an 8-year-old) and give your niece the money from whatever small amount of sales.", "Block them from your social media and then mute their phone numbers. They don\u2019t care about your livelihood, they\u2019re just using you to get what they want and are sacrificing their relationships to you to do it.", "Just fucking tell them no. Don\u2019t be a doormat and try to appease them. They are taking advantage of you and are not even remotely concerned with how you are affected because it benefits their daughter.", "Rather than lie to them, try being simply honest.  It isn't anyone's business how much you make off which shows or your overhead or learning curve, etc.  Just say no to sharing your space & leave it at that.  You owe no explanation.\n\nSerious art consumers aren't interested in the booth with the cute kid playing 'artist', they're interested in professionalism.  Being honestly professional can further your career, being a bumbling pushover will not.", "You're making this way more complicated than it needs to be. Just say \"no\", clearly and firmly. You need to communicate.\n\nSame with your niece at the convention. The moment she stood in front of your table, keeping you from your livelihood, is the moment you should have told her to sit down. You don't have to be mean, but you need to be firm.", "Can you block them on social media so that they can\u2019t see the dates? It might make your life a little easier.", "Unfortunately, kids just aren't well equipped to think about money like that. Plus her parents have probably already skewed the discussion for her.\n\nOP might get more mileage out of a heartfelt apology that she can't bring the niece even though she wants to. Which is true, I think! If there were no downsides, OP would probably be happy to have her there.\n\nThis would be a really convenient time to go foraging in the convention rules for some clause that OP isn't allowed to do the family selling thing. It probably wouldn't be hard to legitimately manufacture something like that by asking a friendly event organizer about this situation (though family doesn't have to know OP actively sought out the rule).", "Exactly this. And OP, I would not be giving out your income numbers at all. It's none of their business. Just tell them that she is a distraction, and you don't need that. This is your livelihood not a hobby.\n\nLet them purchase her own table if she can. That's on them to fund, not you.", "genuinely when they started threatening me with Christmas my initial feeling was like oh dang, that could be really nice actually! Plus I'm usually the one who cooks so their loss", "I would, but I have a website, and public art profiles on most social media, I'd miss out on a lot of potential marketing if I made it so they couldn't see it", "If their threat comes with relief on your end, I think that says everything you need about the family dynamic. They sound super toxic.", "Now that's funny - you're the one who usually cooks? Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face. I would bet money that when it gets closer to Christmas, they'll all of a sudden \"forgive\" you so you'll do the cooking. Might be a good time to rent an AirBnB for a couple of days and tell them \"sorry, I have other plans\".", "Honestly my first thought reading your post and your replies was, \"Why are you keeping contact with these people at all?\"", "Book yourself into a nice hotel out of town for Christmas", "No, just block *them*, not make it all private. So everyone but them can see it.", "No you wouldn\u2019t? Are they marketing *for* you? How does only them not seeing what con you\u2019re at effect your sales? That makes no sense", "Seriously, just be like, \"sorry, but I have a date with a mug of mulled wine and my favourite movie. I mean, you said to find somewhere else to be for Christmas...\"\n\nAs someone who's run a stall at a con before, I empathise so much. It's stressful enough to cope with barnacles (the ones who block your stall looking and maybe praising but not buying) without those barnacles being sabotaging attention seeking family members. NTA, OP. This is your job, even if they don't acknowledge art as a job. They probably won't ever understand, I'm afraid, so I can only wish you luck with the fallout. Just be firm."]}
