It was always an argument when I was younger because I would try to avoid photos and felt forced into it. I still feel like this as an adult but try and force a smile mostly for my grandparents on holidays. I am very self conscious and don't use social media much. Everyone in my family knows all of this and doesn't really care. If they want a picture they take it and I just have to 'deal with it.'\n\nLast weekend was my dad's birthday. Our whole family was there including my niece (11F) Sara. She recently got a cell phone and started a YouTube channel. She posts every day, multiple times a day.\n\nWhen they arrived she had her phone out and was recording everything. I talked to her mom (38F) privately on the side and asked her to please ask Sara not to film me. She laughed and said oh kids will be kids, she's just enjoying her new phone, no one sees what she posts anyway. I said hey I understand but I'm not comfortable being filmed, and as a kid and young female it's important to understand consent in all areas of life. \n\nThat didn't go over well. Aunt goes off on me, I'm a brat, she's just a kid, don't tell her how to mother, so on. \n\nI walked away, not trying to ruin my dad's birthday. Sara is still filming and I decide to speak directly to her. I said hey Sara, that's so exciting about your new phone. I'm uncomfortable being filmed though, can you please leave me out of it? She says ok, but then later starts filming everything including me again.\n\nI ended up leaving the party right after cake because I feel self conscious and just want to go home. \n\nThat evening, I see that my niece has posted multiple YouTube videos and I am in almost every one. Her channel is not private and one of the videos is already over 1000 views. Which is weird to me because again she is 11, who is watching this stuff? \n\nIn a moment of anger I went through and reported all of the videos i was in. The next week I get an angry call from her mom saying her channel was terminated because of her age. Apparently even with an adults permission you have to be 13 to have an account. And she knows I had to have been the one to report her. \n\nWe go back and forth a while and I did say we'll the age is there for a reason, why are you ok with 1000 people watching a videos of your 11 year old dancing? \n\nEveryone in the family thinks I'm a big ahole for reporting the channel and that I bullied my niece because I have low self esteem. They think I should apologize to her and my aunt for basically saying she is a bad mom. I don't think I'm the bad person in this situation and think I should be apologized to for ignoring my boundaries!", "created_utc": 1702231926, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18f9i5z/aita_for_reporting_my_nieces_youtube_channel_and/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(1) I reported the videos and niece's account got kicked off. I argued with her mom about it and basically questioned why she was ok with strangers on the internet watching videos of her 11 year old. (2) The whole family thinks I should apologize to niece for getting her account kicked, and i should apologize to her mom since I questioned her parenting. They think I made a big deal because I have low self esteem and don't want to be on camera.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You did not give consent to be filmed and 11 is more than old enough to learn that if people don't consent to something, don't do it. Also, she did violate YouTube's age policy, which there are reasons for existing, although I think even 13 is still too young.", "NTA. If niece isn't old enough to understand consent or the consequences of violating an apps agreements, she's not old enough to use the app. Neither is your family form the looks of it.", "NTA. No one is looking out for that girl\u2019s safety. \n\nYou know why an 11 year old\u2019s videos get so many views? Typically it\u2019s not other 11 year olds.", "NTA. Unfortunately her mother doesn't have the common sense to understand why it's not good for a 11 yo to freely post on the internet with a public account. If she can't see this, I doubt she will comprehend why you don't want to be filmed and put online without your consent. Unfortunately, your family seems to be struggling to understand this too. I'm sorry OP, you're surrounded by AH.", "Nta. People gotta learn to teach their children consent and not to record people who don\u2019t want to be recorded (and also not to post EVERYTHING online)", "NTA. Filmers should be aware of privacy and permission. And decency. obviously why 11 year olds shouldn't have complete free reign.", "YTA. Your reaction to being filmed is extreme.", "NTA I would do the same thing.", "Nta and i felt same about other relatives who lied about age on meta", "NTA", "NTA Why doesn't she realise how dangerous it is for her very young daughter to be posting images of herself? Is she unaware of all the predators out there just creeping around exactly for this content?\n\nAlso, your body, your choice. It doesn't matter if you're a very public person or a very private one. This is a violation.", " Nta", "NTA at all. In fact, you may have nipped some sketchy stuff in the bud before it happened.", "NTA.  She was underage for a YT account and doesn't understand consent.  That's two strikes.  In a couple of years, you'll have to report her new YT channel.", "NTA, you clearly stated your boundaries and were ignored multiple times. Consent is an important lesson for everyone to learn. Plus that fact that her mom was okay with her daughter having that much exposure online when she's 11 is kinda sketchy to me. there are a lot of stories of parents taking advantage of their kids for internet fame, even if it means exposing their kids to creeps online.", "NTA. As you said, they have to be 13 for a reason. I have rather dim views on why the over 1000 people would be watching these kids dancing. But the again, my views may be jaded and I shall not lay them out here. Use your imagination, if you must.", "NTA. I hate the \"kids will be kids\" offered up as a rationale; like because they are kids they can't/shouldn't be disciplined. Is she going to say the same if her daughter is assaulted? (\"Boys will be boys\").\n\nNiece's mother is obv poor at parenting to not notice the age limit of youtube. Was just reading an article about how those age limits should be even higher due to the destructive power of social media.\n\nAnyway, mother disregarded your boundaries. Daughter disregarded your boundaries. Daughter was violating youtube's service agreement. And does the mother not realize how dangerous it can be for kids to be posting online? With new AI technology seeing an increasing incident of fake porn, where someone's head is placed on a nude body?\n\nThey should be ones apologizing to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They need guidance to understand appropriate behavior. As your niece gets older, she will also encounter situations where she may not legally film regardless of what she wants to do, and even if she can legally record, there are many times when it is not the right thing to do. Your family is failing your niece. \n\nNTA", "Exactly. We all bang on about being responsible about what kids post because *bad things can happen*, but OP uses her own agency to protest being posted, and the response is, 'mellow out, kids be kids'? \n\nWhat's the point of even teaching kids about the permanence of the internet if you actually DGAF and laugh it off?\n\nShe's ELEVEN. 5th or 6th grade.
