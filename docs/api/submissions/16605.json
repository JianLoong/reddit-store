And if your family is trying to pressure you into Marine academy programs, they may well try to pressure you into actually enlisting.

But he\u2019s also 50 and about to enter rehab again after a 12-day alcohol bender that nearly killed him (it would\u2019ve had I not found him near death and sent his ass to detox), and the trauma he experienced in boot camp is part of the reason. \n\nThe military\u2019s goal is to make excellent SOLDIERS\u2014 not healthy, whole human beings.

It's not his fault for not doing it first, it's on his parents for not being clear that there were hidden caveats. As adults you get stuff presented in a way where you can see these holes (like, literally that's what terms and conditions have. And contracts in general), but as teens, parents can hide stuff.

I got a job as a swim instructor voluntarily when I was 16 while in school just because I wanted to feel grown up and I loved it. It didn\u2019t detract from school or my social life, but it did teach me valuable interpersonal skills like being comfortable talking to superiors and the sense of pride that I got from earning my own spending money spurred me to learn better budgeting skills, something I think every teen should learn while they still have the total safety net of their parents. If the kid is working 20-30 hours a week because of the oppressive forces of poverty then yeah that\u2019s a problem, but don\u2019t lump that in with a part time after school or summer job that is basically an extracurricular.", "Easy to say but what if the family can't give the kids what they need?

But I hardly grew up rich--my family really struggled at times--and even so I was able to periodically get a type of snacks I liked or a cupcake or something. I find it weird people jumped to \"kids don't get treats!\" If you can't afford to give your kid something nice once in a while \"just because\" it's sad, not something to be applauded.

Nor does it mean it\u2019s ok for kids to have to work to be able to afford things that should be given for granted. My point was: let\u2019s stop pretending it\u2019s normal. People in the comments are saying this kid needs to get a job to pay back his mom (when from what we gather it\u2019s not like the family is struggling). I believe that would be a cruel punishment.

That is not the only factor, my guess is all of you had different (while maybe just slightly) experiences growing up (or did you all also have the same friends, boyfriends, etc?). Also, unless you\u2019re all triplets (which I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not bc you\u2019re different ages) then even genetics/personality play a role. \n\nFun fact, I also have two other sisters.

I expect us to be different people, however my youngest sister has routinely been fired because she cannot seem to understand that she is not the boss. She was allowed to be the boss at home, didn\u2019t have to work for anything and when she finally left the house at 21 she didn\u2019t understand how to listen to the chain of command. She could have learned how if she had had a job when she was younger and still developing her world view. For comparison when I was 28 I had spent three years working full time as a CNA and medtech in an assisted living facility, knew how to budget and live within my means etc. She meanwhile has blown through over $250,000 in inheritance in under two years. She never learned how to be responsible for herself. She never learned how to not be the boss, and she never learned how to budget.", "So if a person exists somewhere, the default spot is the USA unless they say otherwise? \n\nThe mixture of that comment, plus the fact they were worried about a draft that(as many people have pointed out) hasnt been used in the usa for a long time tells us they aren't from the USA.

It\u2019s way harder and more demanding, and it\u2019s already a massive adjustment with being on your own for the first time.

Even if you live somewhere where school is free or have parents who can afford post secondary, having your own money grants a lot of independence. You also can\u2019t expect your parents to pay for every luxury you want or every outing with friends.", "I dunno why this is being downvoted to oblivion; astronomical and meteorological seasons are in fact different dates.", "Maybe\u2026 just maybe.. if kids were allowed to focus on high school instead of worrying about finding jobs and having enough money, they could actually learn something, develop in a healthy way and want (and would be able) to go to college/university after.\n\nAlso, it is one thing to WANT to get a summer job for a little extra money than having to work full time bc they can\u2019t afford housing or food. I\u2019m not suggesting anything, not proposing a universal age to start working, given that every person is different and we all have different developmental needs, when they should start to learn these skills is going to vary.

My point is, high school education is just as important as college, maybe even more so, given that you\u2019re still developing and learning life skills. Having to work (emphasis on having) can have detrimental effects on young adults. Even if it\u2019s \u201climited hours\u201d.

My bad if it came out like that. I\u2019m just surprised how many Americans (I know it\u2019s not all) think kids should grow up quickly and they want them all out of their house at 18, with every life skill necessary. I know this isn\u2019t what you were saying, but it is so important to let kids be kids, to let them develop in a healthy way. Let them grow in a safe environment without having to worry about jobs or finding a place as soon as they turn 18.
