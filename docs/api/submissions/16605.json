And if your family is trying to pressure you into Marine academy programs, they may well try to pressure you into actually enlisting.

But he\u2019s also 50 and about to enter rehab again after a 12-day alcohol bender that nearly killed him (it would\u2019ve had I not found him near death and sent his ass to detox), and the trauma he experienced in boot camp is part of the reason. \n\nThe military\u2019s goal is to make excellent SOLDIERS\u2014 not healthy, whole human beings. The two are very often incompatible. If you are okay with this, then it\u2019s not my business.

However, a lot of people tend to go back to their old ways when put back in their old environment, making it functionally a waste of time, lol.", "except this person just found some random program that is no way confirmed to be the op\u2019s lol", "Oh, you can enlist at 17 in the US, with parental consent. Because you\u2019re not old enough to legally enter into a contract.", "Homie you weren\u2019t drafted because the US hasn\u2019t drafted anybody since the Vietnam War.", "The US hasn't used a draft since the 70's...  filling out your selective service card doesn't mean you would have been drafted.  It sounds like your mental health got you out of the requirement wholesale anyway...  but even if you had been found \"fit\" to stay on the draft roles, you wouldn't have been drafted anyway.  Congress has to enact a new draft for those lists to be used.", "Lots of parents use summer camp as child care so it depends on how old op is", "He's not in the US, as he stated above", "If Op is old enough to attend what is essentially a military indoctrination program, they are old enough to not require child care over the summer.", " Bet you that she did and deliberately didn't mention it.", "Idk man, I'm not sure where op lives, but in America, you're never too young to be indoctrinated into the Military", "Better than compulsory service like a lot of Europe has!", "Yeah we had recruiters come to my middle school, they come to my high school every year, and there were even several engagements my elementary school hosted from military speakers about how \"noble\" of a career it was and how important it is that kids like us look at the military when we get older."]}
