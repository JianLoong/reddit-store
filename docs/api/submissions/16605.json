NTA if you are still in high school, if your parents didn\u2019t tell you about the deposit, or if the deposit is small enough for you to reimburse them in a reasonable amount of time. If you\u2019re in college or older and they did, YWBTA if you don\u2019t  follow through. \n\nThough, as the partner of a former Marine, I want you to know it\u2019s important to be aware the Marines reinforce stuff like head shaving at their summer programs in part because they use them to \u201cbreak\u201d potential recruits and increase their chances of feeling like they don\u2019t belong anywhere else, so that they will want to enlist. And if your family is trying to pressure you into Marine academy programs, they may well try to pressure you into actually enlisting. If that\u2019s something you want to go into fully informed because YOU want to, then that\u2019s your choice to make, but if not, I am BEGGING you not to do it. \n\nWhy? Partner joined up at 17 to one-up his abusive step dad, an Air Force guy who used his strength, violent tendencies, and fake superiority to terrorize my dude and make him feel worthless. And damn if he wasn\u2019t crazy, stubborn, AND talented enough to shut the guy up forevermore with his exemplary performance (step dad couldn\u2019t even come close). But even the experience of going through boot camp and the crucible created lasting trauma for him, and that\u2019s not uncommon at all. \n\nCould he save me in a zombie apocalypse or if society collapses? Could he kill someone with a knife in hand-to hand combat? Almost certainly. But he\u2019s also 50 and about to enter rehab again after nearly dying from a 12-day alcohol bender that nearly killed him (it would\u2019ve had I not found him near death and sent his ass to detox), and the trauma he experienced in boot camp is part of the reason. \n\nThe military\u2019s goal is to make excellent SOLDIERS\u2014 not healthy, whole human beings. The two are very often incompatible. If you are okay with this, then it\u2019s not my business. But please, PLEASE understand: a summer program is one thing, but enlisting is NOT a decision you should let anyone else railroad you into. Type \u201cmarines crucible trauma recruits\u201d and you will find some hecking terrifying horror stories. \n\nReally not trying to make a statement about the objective value of the Marines, but it\u2019s SO important that you learn what you\u2019d be getting yourself into if you are considering going farther with these people than a low-commitment exercise program. If this institution is not right for you and you enlist for the wrong reasons, it could literally still be jeopardizing your safety, life, and marriage at age 50. \n\nBe well.", "You should check things out before agreeing to do them.
