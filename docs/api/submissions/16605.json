And if your family is trying to pressure you into Marine academy programs, they may well try to pressure you into actually enlisting.

But he\u2019s also 50 and about to enter rehab again after a 12-day alcohol bender that nearly killed him (it would\u2019ve had I not found him near death and sent his ass to detox), and the trauma he experienced in boot camp is part of the reason. \n\nThe military\u2019s goal is to make excellent SOLDIERS\u2014 not healthy, whole human beings.

It's not his fault for not doing it first, it's on his parents for not being clear that there were hidden caveats.
