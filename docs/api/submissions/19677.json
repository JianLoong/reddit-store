I know they\u2019re very close, my son talks about him often, and likes to buy stuff for him as much as he can.\n\nI only met John 3 times, and the only thing I knew about him before meeting him was that his parents were very protective of him so the first time he came into our home was the first time he was allowed to be with friends. \n\nI was really happy to meet John at first, because he\u2019s my sons closest friend. But I don\u2019t know if he is those brutally honest types or doesn\u2019t understand theres a time and place for things.\n\nWhen I first met him, my son invited him to the birthday party of his oldest sister (28f). John asked a lot of insensitive questions about issues my oldest daughter was going through, which my son must\u2019ve told him, not sure why. He was very open with what he thought, even if it was just plain rude.  \nHe did this two other times when he was invited. \n\nMy son defended him saying that John didn\u2019t know it was wrong, because he was raised differently from us, each time he did it. We also never got an apology.\n\nWe were fed up by the third time, and I asked my son to not bring him around next time. He was still allowed to hang out with John, but not bring him over.\n\nMy son\u2019s birthday is coming up, and what we do is have a small celebration just family and some close friends, and then the birthday person celebrates the day as they wish. \nMy son wants to spend it with John, but also wants to invite John to the family celebration part. \n\nHe\u2019s asked multiple times and I said no, i\u2019d be willing to change my mind if John apologizes to the people he hurt with his questions and \u2018honesty\u2019.

I'd understand if it was another family member. But it seems a little cruel you don't want to let your son have who you describe as \"his closest friend\" at his birthday party. \n\nIf his parents are very protective and don't let him go out that much, that very likely explains why he doesn't have certain social skills. You should talk to your son about discussing with John what it's okay to share that you know and what needs to be kept to himself. Or, if he tries that in front of you again, straight up say to him that it's not the place to be asking those things.", "I think that your son should get to hang w his friend for his birthday, and what your son said is true, some people are just raised a little bit differently and don\u2019t seem to understand when to hold their tongue", "ESH\n\nJohn for his intrusive questions.\n\nYou for banning him on your son's birthday, when he's your son's friend.\n\nIf it was anyone but your son's birthday it would be N_T_A.\n\nMaybe you could say to your son John can come if your son warns him beforehand not to ask personal questions, and your son agrees that either you or he will redirect John if he starts making anyone uncomfortable.", "YTA.

It's your house, and you get a say on who comes in.", "YTA - it's your son's birthday, so his wishes should come first, and you don't want to refuse to let his friend go, as that might affect your relationship with your son.

It's apparent John has been brought up in a very confined and conservative environment, robbed of many qualities of life and normalcies of society that you mundanely enjoy.   \nYour son is the one who is trying to help his friend expand his horizons and get him to socialise. HE understands his friend has problems in social situations and is trying to help. I hope you can see that banning this child from healthy social interactions would be detrimental to his wellbeing, and irrevocably damage the relationship between your son and you.  \n\n\nIf Johns parents haven't broached the lesson of appropriate questions and handling curiosity at the age of 15 then they're unlikely to do it.

You have 364 other days to deal with this situation.", "Then I say NTA. You communicated clearly and directly. You don\u2019t have to host this kid.

If ypur son is sharing personal details and the friend is then asking invasive questions about your daughter than I absolutely understand not wanting them at a family get together, especially if you worry your daughter's privacy might be impacted around family.\n\nYour son can absolutely celebrate his birthday with his friend, but it being his birthday doesn't give him the right to create a hostile environment for his sister. It being his birthday shouldn't impact rules around who is allowed at the house. \n\nIt seems like there may be a deeper reason your son's friend isn't respecting boundaries, but that doesn't mean you need to put your family in a position that feels unsafe.

Neither of these things are his fault, but they are his responsibility to deal with and manage.\n\nI think you need to sit down with your son and have a serious discussion about how John's behavior has made other people feel. He needs to understand that even if John doesn't know what he said is wrong, it is still wrong. As John's friend, he should want to help John because in a few years, if he tries to go to college, enter the workforce, etc. a lot of people are not going to be as patient/understanding/kind to him when he acts insensitively.\n\nYou should also tell your son that telling other people about someone else's personal issues/struggles is not okay. What his sister is going through is not his business to share.\n\nNow to the birthday debacle, YWBTA if you invite your son's friends to the family celebration, but exclude John. The best option would be to make the celebration family only, and then offer to take your son and his friends out for a separate celebration.

Could be bad parents, could be a little bit on the spectrum, or he could just be a fucking teenager. Whatever the case may be the more he gets out and socializes the more of a chance he has at becoming a healthy successful adult. Talk to your son and tell him to have John come over earlier then everyone else. Sit them both down together, explain to John how some things he says makes others feel and ask him if he has any questions.

I am however just want to point something out. Often when a sibling is going through a tough time, it can negatively affect the other kid. If your son cares about his sister he may be worried about her. It could also possibly be raising concerns for him about really hard topics. (Like mortality, how easy something bad can happen etc.) You don't need to be directly affected by something for it to have a strong impact. Both for better and for worse. He may have chosen to talk to John over you in order to get support as a way to not burden you and your spouse durring a already difficult time. \n\nThis doesn't mean you failed as a parent. Just means things got tricky and a sixteen year old reacted the way sixteen year old do. Lean on the people they trust most. Typically those people being friends rather than family. What I'm trying to say here is it sounds like John is a huge source of emotional support and comfort for your son. NAH for this so far. Not wanting your daughter get bombarded with insensitive questions is reasonable and your letting him see John outside the home on his birthday. \n\nYou may want to consider getting to know John on a few more future occasions like taking the boys to the movies etc. Part of supporting someone can mean helping them support the people they love/care for.
