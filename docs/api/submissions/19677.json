I know they\u2019re very close, my son talks about him often, and likes to buy stuff for him as much as he can.\n\nI only met John 3 times, and the only thing I knew about him before meeting him was that his parents were very protective of him so the first time he came into our home was the first time he was allowed to be with friends. \n\nI was really happy to meet John at first, because he\u2019s my sons closest friend. But I don\u2019t know if he is those brutally honest types or doesn\u2019t understand theres a time and place for things.\n\nWhen I first met him, my son invited him to the birthday party of his oldest sister (28f). John asked a lot of insensitive questions about issues my oldest daughter was going through, which my son must\u2019ve told him, not sure why. He was very open with what he thought, even if it was just plain rude.  \nHe did this two other times when he was invited. \n\nMy son defended him saying that John didn\u2019t know it was wrong, because he was raised differently from us, each time he did it. We also never got an apology.\n\nWe were fed up by the third time, and I asked my son to not bring him around next time. He was still allowed to hang out with John, but not bring him over.\n\nMy son\u2019s birthday is coming up, and what we do is have a small celebration just family and some close friends, and then the birthday person celebrates the day as they wish. \nMy son wants to spend it with John, but also wants to invite John to the family celebration part. \n\nHe\u2019s asked multiple times and I said no, i\u2019d be willing to change my mind if John apologizes to the people he hurt with his questions and \u2018honesty\u2019. He stopped asking me, but its clear he is upset about it.\n\nSo aita? Should I go with it just for this one day?\n\nedit: just going to answer some questions that are being brought up a lot.\n1. Is John Neurodivergent?\nI don\u2019t know, but I see now it could be a possibility.\n\n2. Did I explain to him the questions/what he was saying were inappropriate?\nYes, multiple times. So did my daughter. He defended himself by saying he was just being honest, or that he just wanted to know.\n\n3. Why did it take so long for me to meet my sons best friend? \nWell he has protective parents. He wasn\u2019t allowed to visit friends until October when he was 15, around my oldest daughters birthday.\nMy son never introduced me to John when I pick him up after school, so they may also have different ways of getting to and from school.", "created_utc": 1686759618, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149c2hu/aita_for_telling_my_son_i_dont_want_his_friend_at/", "score": 2318, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd understand if it was another family member. But it seems a little cruel you don't want to let your son have who you describe as \"his closest friend\" at his birthday party. \n\nIf his parents are very protective and don't let him go out that much, that very likely explains why he doesn't have certain social skills. You should talk to your son about discussing with John what it's okay to share that you know and what needs to be kept to himself. Or, if he tries that in front of you again, straight up say to him that it's not the place to be asking those things.", "I think that your son should get to hang w his friend for his birthday, and what your son said is true, some people are just raised a little bit differently and don\u2019t seem to understand when to hold their tongue", "ESH\n\nJohn for his intrusive questions.\n\nYou for banning him on your son's birthday, when he's your son's friend.\n\nIf it was anyone but your son's birthday it would be N_T_A.\n\nMaybe you could say to your son John can come if your son warns him beforehand not to ask personal questions, and your son agrees that either you or he will redirect John if he starts making anyone uncomfortable.", "YTA.

It's your house, and you get a say on who comes in.", "YTA - it's your son's birthday, so his wishes should come first, and you don't want to refuse to let his friend go, as that might affect your relationship with your son.

It's apparent John has been brought up in a very confined and conservative environment, robbed of many qualities of life and normalcies of society that you mundanely enjoy.   \nYour son is the one who is trying to help his friend expand his horizons and get him to socialise. HE understands his friend has problems in social situations and is trying to help. I hope you can see that banning this child from healthy social interactions would be detrimental to his wellbeing, and irrevocably damage the relationship between your son and you.  \n\n\nIf Johns parents haven't broached the lesson of appropriate questions and handling curiosity at the age of 15 then they're unlikely to do it.

I assume he'll be at the friends part through? \n\nJohn may be neurodivergent, just keep that in mind. Or, he might just be an a-hole, I dunno - but you are the adult here. Set the ground rules.

You have 364 other days to deal with this situation.", "Then I say NTA. You communicated clearly and directly. You don\u2019t have to host this kid.

It being his birthday shouldn't impact rules around who is allowed at the house. \n\nIt seems like there may be a deeper reason your son's friend isn't respecting boundaries, but that doesn't mean you need to put your family in a position that feels unsafe.

Neither of these things are his fault, but they are his responsibility to deal with and manage.\n\nI think you need to sit down with your son and have a serious discussion about how John's behavior has made other people feel. He needs to understand that even if John doesn't know what he said is wrong, it is still wrong. As John's friend, he should want to help John because in a few years, if he tries to go to college, enter the workforce, etc. a lot of people are not going to be as patient/understanding/kind to him when he acts insensitively.\n\nYou should also tell your son that telling other people about someone else's personal issues/struggles is not okay. What his sister is going through is not his business to share.\n\nNow to the birthday debacle, YWBTA if you invite your son's friends to the family celebration, but exclude John.

If your son cares about his sister he may be worried about her. It could also possibly be raising concerns for him about really hard topics. (Like mortality, how easy something bad can happen etc.) You don't need to be directly affected by something for it to have a strong impact. Both for better and for worse. He may have chosen to talk to John over you in order to get support as a way to not burden you and your spouse durring a already difficult time. \n\nThis doesn't mean you failed as a parent. Just means things got tricky and a sixteen year old reacted the way sixteen year old do. Lean on the people they trust most. Typically those people being friends rather than family.

Not wanting your daughter get bombarded with insensitive questions is reasonable and your letting him see John outside the home on his birthday. \n\nYou may want to consider getting to know John on a few more future occasions like taking the boys to the movies etc. Part of supporting someone can mean helping them support the people they love/care for.

His behavior is all over the place. He acts as though he's never used a fork and knife.

He gets one more warning, I tell him that the behavior isn't how we act here, it is inconsiderate/rude/inappropriate and why that is as well as what behavior to replace the negative one, and if he chooses to continue to act appropriately, I will call his dad/mom to come get him. \n\nI have only had to call once, and one other time, he had a panic attack, and I called the mom to see what she wanted me to do.

Because if its something like asking about pregnancy or other things like that he might be curious and not understand why what he is saying is wrong (or inappropriate). Does he have some form of autism or something along those lines (which is why he might have been sheltered growing up because of fears of socializing and etc) because the friendship with your son might be really formative for him. But if he truly went out of line (there are alot of things which would count like commenting on a miscarriage cruely) then I can understand your point of view and an apology is needed. Because as much as socializing can help someone they also need to learn when they are in the wrong and apologize. Because sheltering them from things like that only stunts their emotional growth. The only thing I am slightly wary on is you said the party is Family and close friends, and not allowing the birthday boy to bring his own friends to his party is not a great thing to do.

Because if the rest of the family hates him than him being there does noone good if there is a massive amount of tension.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: BTW when I asked like how bad I dont mean specifically what did he say because I can understand wanting to keep it private (I mean the friend is a prime example of that lol).

Maybe if you were more specific about what was said I\u2019d have a different opinion. But, imo, it\u2019s one thing to expect an apology if, say, John came over and was goofing off and broke something, or was irresponsible and perhaps caused damage to your property or something, was making demands of you or even if he said something excessively disrespectful or judgmental, like \u201c[your religion, belief system, gender, race] are such prudes\u201d or \u201c[parents] are controlling and don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about\u201d, but teens learn by testing boundaries and it almost sounds like you\u2019re expecting him to apologize for an aspect of his personality rather than a mistake he made.

Your daughter deserves to feel safe attending your son\u2019s birthday party, and I see you\u2019re trying to make that happen. But on the other hand, your son\u2019s friend is clearly important to him, and your son\u2019s autonomy to make his own decisions and choose who he associates with is also something to be valued and fostered as he grows into an older teen and later a young adult. Making your own judgements and decisions about who you associate with, how it reflects on you, what actions you will tolerate and extend grace for versus what boundaries to set and maintain, etc. as a teen while you still have the safety net of your parents is an integral part of development, and your son is facing a doozy of a situation right now.\nWhile I see that others have, I won\u2019t speculate on whether there\u2019s a romantic element in the relationship between John and your son because men and boys (everyone, really, but for reasons beyond this discussion, it\u2019s something that ought to be especially fostered in young men) deserve to have close platonic friendships without outsiders pushing a sexual or romantic element. That said, given your description of the two, I wouldn\u2019t rule it out either. Regardless, it\u2019s not the deciding factor at this time, just food for thought.\nThe main issue- you don\u2019t want a repeat event where a guest in your home makes your child uncomfortable. I commend that. Your son wants his close friend at his birthday party, and that\u2019s valid too. He\u2019s 16 and should get some autonomy in making this decision for himself, and I do think there\u2019s a way to balance your desire to protect yourself, your daughter, and your other guests with your desire to respect your son\u2019s decision making about something that\u2019s clearly quite important to him.\nTalk to your son. Let him know that John, as your son\u2019s guest, is your son\u2019s responsibility and that as the junior host, your son has an obligation to monitor John\u2019s behaviour when he is inviting John into a shared home. It\u2019s fine and admirable that your son has recognized that a peer of his is struggling with important life skills and wants to help his friend, but that doesn\u2019t mean enabling or excusing bad behaviour, or lighting himself or his siblings on fire to keep John warm. I am not suggesting your son become this unfortunate child\u2019s keeper - far from it (and do keep an eye on your son\u2019s mental health in this relationship too, as it sounds like a complex situation), only that if this is an important person to your son, your son should be taking action to foster healthy interactions between the people important to him. In this case it means discussing these concerns with you, and then likely having a difficult conversation with John about what is and isn\u2019t appropriate to say to other people, and how things can be hurtful or inappropriate to discuss in certain circumstances and environments, even though that\u2019s not John\u2019s intention. If your son wants John there, then your son needs to ensure John knows what is expected of him, and the conditions of civility that are required for attendance at the event.\nJohn doesn\u2019t need to change his behaviour, but he also doesn\u2019t need to come, if that compromise isn\u2019t something he\u2019s willing to implement.\nPoor John. Trusting your son\u2019s judgement, it seems like John\u2019s parents have done him a huge disservice. It\u2019s not his fault that he has been handicapped by his parents choices or by a condition beyond his control that his parents seem to have inadequately addressed, but it is John\u2019s responsibility to not harm people around him to the best of his capabilities, whatever those may be. Your son is showing him grace as John learns, and I hope you will as well (up to the point of hardship you deem appropriate, of course) but make sure John knows there is a limit to the grace he can extend if John is unwilling to consider the consequences of his ignorance. I think your best course of action as a parent is to sit down with your son and guide him through this difficult interpersonal situation. It seems it\u2019s an opportunity for learning for both if these kids who are learning how to be young men. I\u2019d say let John come. Convey the expectations you have to your son. He needs to make sure John knows them as well.

I started tutoring him when he was 16 to prepare him for college. I knew he was always a bit quirky, but didn't realize how detached he was about things he should be doing at his age. He would sit down at the table and demand what's for dinner. My head must've turned around several times before asking him \"what did you say?\" I gave him an earful about how he needs to learn how to cook, clean and take care of himself! Thankfully, I'm close to his mom, so she let me set rules for him. Not only does know how to cook and clean now, but he is much better in social settings and doesn't just blurt out his thoughts.

At worse he's asking inappropriate questions and giving unwelcome opinions, not engaging in reckless, dangerous, or larcenous behavior.\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable, however, to inform John when he's asking something inappropriate and to refuse to engage further on a matter. Let's say for the sake the argument that John has poor social skills\u2014 or maybe he's neurodivergent (people on the autism spectrum can exhibit similar behaviors as you've described). Be that as it may, as his age he needs to have the ability to back off when requested, but you may need to be direct\u2014 again he may not possess the neurological ability to \"take a hint\", as it were.\n\nIf it were me, I would not bar John from the event, but I would proceed with the assumption that John is neurologically incapable of recognizing normal social boundaries or hints, and prep other guests for the same and make clear that John probably means no harm, nobody owes it to him to engage in discomforting interactions, and to be polite but firm if needing to disengage.\n\nYou also said your son once invited John to his older sister's birthday party. Unless John and your son are romantically involved (and new romantic partners that no one else has met yet are invited), he shouldn't have the power to unilaterally invite other people to someone else's birthday party. That should've been cleared with his sister first.\n\nSo in general it seems like some boundaries need to be set; but just banning John from your house, or setting up unreasonable conditions for his reentry, like demanding apologies for past interactions, these are just going to distance you from your son.", "Yta.

So he\u2019s not only asking inappropriate questions but also giving inappropriate advice and also violating his friend\u2019s trust because he\u2019s repeating things they talked about in private. \n\nYour son is violating his sister\u2019s privacy by talking about her issues with this friend.And, as the cherry on top, this friend talks crap about your friend\u2019s religion without asking any questions and then says \u201c Well I\u2019m just being honest!\u201d ( Narcissists use that every time they hurt others.)\n\nIt sounds like this kid John might be neurodivergent or on the Autism spectrum. He also could have zero social skills because he has lived a sheltered life. And he might also be looking for attention because even bad attention is still attention when you get none at home.Maybe this young man wasn\u2019t raised to be polite, have manners or know what you should not say. 16 is an awkward age, but perhaps nobody in his home is teaching him how he should behave amongst others and how to treat other people.\n\nHmmm. This could be a teachable moment for both your son and his friend about appropriate conversation for mixed gatherings of people and small talk for parties. It could also be a teachable moment about how you should not talk about others behind their backs because it is hurtful. This could also be a discussion on good conversation starters for parties where everyone can join in and feel comfortable and included. They both could benefit from some coaching from you.\n\nIf you don\u2019t wish to talk to your son and his friend, then there is a possibility that your son will spend less time at home and more with this friend. This friend might be a \u201c bad influence \u201c later on so it might be best to try to help him now.It is your son\u2019s birthday so it might be worth it to talk to both of them so hopefully John won\u2019t act out of line next time, and your son will be able to see him at his birthday party.\n\nI hope this helps, and John\u2019s feelings are  not in any way more important than your daughter\u2019s or your religious friend\u2019s as he is in the wrong for the things he said.

Some people can figure out things on their own, some can't and need guidance. If OP just said to John that the questions were rude and it's none of his business, but forgot to explain why exactly, then, of course, John didn't learn from that experience.

As others have suggested, maybe he\u2019s neurodivergent, maybe he\u2019s socially awkward, maybe he just has a crappy home life.\n\nMaybe try looking at it from his POV. He\u2019s been close with your kid since they were what, 10? 11? And he was never allowed to go to anyone\u2019s house. He\u2019s probably thought a lot about meeting you all over the years. Has heard about you from your son. Felt connected to you maybe even in a certain way. Yes he was completely wrong to make your daughter uncomfortable and that needs to be discussed, but his defensiveness could very well have been from the realization that he finally met his good friend\u2019s family and my god they think everything he does is wrong. Maybe he\u2019s a teenager and doesn\u2019t care, maybe it\u2019s crushing. \n\nI was socially awkward as fuck as a kid and young teen, and i made bad impressions on so many of my friends\u2019 parents without truly understanding how or why.
