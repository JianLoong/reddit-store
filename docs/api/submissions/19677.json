I know they\u2019re very close, my son talks about him often, and likes to buy stuff for him as much as he can.\n\nI only met John 3 times, and the only thing I knew about him before meeting him was that his parents were very protective of him so the first time he came into our home was the first time he was allowed to be with friends. \n\nI was really happy to meet John at first, because he\u2019s my sons closest friend. But I don\u2019t know if he is those brutally honest types or doesn\u2019t understand theres a time and place for things.\n\nWhen I first met him, my son invited him to the birthday party of his oldest sister (28f). John asked a lot of insensitive questions about issues my oldest daughter was going through, which my son must\u2019ve told him, not sure why. He was very open with what he thought, even if it was just plain rude.  \nHe did this two other times when he was invited. \n\nMy son defended him saying that John didn\u2019t know it was wrong, because he was raised differently from us, each time he did it. We also never got an apology.\n\nWe were fed up by the third time, and I asked my son to not bring him around next time. He was still allowed to hang out with John, but not bring him over.\n\nMy son\u2019s birthday is coming up, and what we do is have a small celebration just family and some close friends, and then the birthday person celebrates the day as they wish. \nMy son wants to spend it with John, but also wants to invite John to the family celebration part. \n\nHe\u2019s asked multiple times and I said no, i\u2019d be willing to change my mind if John apologizes to the people he hurt with his questions and \u2018honesty\u2019. He stopped asking me, but its clear he is upset about it.\n\nSo aita? Should I go with it just for this one day?", "created_utc": 1686759618, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149c2hu/aita_for_telling_my_son_i_dont_want_his_friend_at/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd understand if it was another family member. But it seems a little cruel you don't want to let your son have who you describe as \"his closest friend\" at his birthday party. \n\nIf his parents are very protective and don't let him go out that much, that very likely explains why he doesn't have certain social skills. You should talk to your son about discussing with John what it's okay to share that you know and what needs to be kept to himself. Or, if he tries that in front of you again, straight up say to him that it's not the place to be asking those things.", "I think that your son should get to hang w his friend for his birthday, and what your son said is true, some people are just raised a little bit differently and don\u2019t seem to understand when to hold their tongue", "ESH\n\nJohn for his intrusive questions.\n\nYou for banning him on your son's birthday, when he's your son's friend.\n\nIf it was anyone but your son's birthday it would be N_T_A.\n\nMaybe you could say to your son John can come if your son warns him beforehand not to ask personal questions, and your son agrees that either you or he will redirect John if he starts making anyone uncomfortable.", "YTA. It's your son's birthday.", "NTA\n\nYou said that he can still spend time with John, but you don't want him in your house because he was rude and made your daughter uncomfortable. That's totally fine. You don't have to include John in a personal family celebration. He still gets to hang out with John on his birthday. I think that's fair. It's your house, and you get a say on who comes in.", "YTA - it's your son's birthday, so his wishes should come first, and you don't want to refuse to let his friend go, as that might affect your relationship with your son.  It's not clear whether the comments were directly challenged by you the 1st 3 times it happened.  Perhaps there needs to be a discussion with John about what's acceptable/appropriate conversation and questions within your family.", "NTA, But you probably should go with it.\n\nIf you're hosting the party, then you can set the rules. But it's your son's birthday, and your son's relationships. Making him choose between his family and friends really sucks.\n\nYour son has the same right not to attend your party. How would that make you feel?", "YTA...It's your son's birthday and your son's celebration.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**This is YOUR SON's birthday. You are an AH if you don't let him have his friend with him for HIS brithday.** \" just family and some close friends\" .. so you want to invite YOUR frineds, but not HIS? - That makes you the AH.", "INFO: are you sure John is just a friend and not a boyfriend? If they\u2019re dating, you should probably try to work things out with John.", "YWBTA.  \n\n\nYour son appears to notice and understand the issue with John and his family more than you do. It's apparent John has been brought up in a very confined and conservative environment, robbed of many qualities of life and normalcies of society that you mundanely enjoy.   \nYour son is the one who is trying to help his friend expand his horizons and get him to socialise. HE understands his friend has problems in social situations and is trying to help. I hope you can see that banning this child from healthy social interactions would be detrimental to his wellbeing, and irrevocably damage the relationship between your son and you.  \n\n\nIf Johns parents haven't broached the lesson of appropriate questions and handling curiosity at the age of 15 then they're unlikely to do it. Best to have a chat with the kid and set some healthy boundaries.", "YTA just let him come lol it's one day and your son's best friend. Are we really gonna have beef with a 16 year old kid; i don't think he has bad intentions. worst case you step in and ask john to talk about other topics if he goes into things your family doesn't like", "NTA\n\nJohn doesn't need to be at the family part of the birthday. I assume he'll be at the friends part through? \n\nJohn may be neurodivergent, just keep that in mind. Or, he might just be an a-hole, I dunno - but you are the adult here. Set the ground rules. If John acts up, send him home. He may not be raised a certain way but he'll be in the real world soon enough and the real world has consequences.", "YTA \n\nI get that you and your family felt hurt by some of the things he asked/said but have you tried talking to him about it, did you try talking to his parents?\nDid you question why he might be like that?\nMaybe he isn't neuro-typical?\n\nAvoidance is no viable solution to this problem. Try being the adult here.\n\nAlso this isn't just a \"family celebration\" It's your son's birthday and he wants to invite his best friend. \nYou don't have to like him you don't have to be happy he's there, but if you have no justifiable reason to tell your son not to meet him anymore then you have no reason to exclude him from your son's birthday party.", "His birthday his choice, but you might want to flag up others might not come or that he might need to apologise for John. YTA. But if John was rude to me I\u2019d be rude right back at him.", "YTA sorry, but it's your sons birthday he should have whoever he likes at his party. Maybe forewarn your relatives about John, maybe his social skills aren't that great. My nephew has adhd and he's very blunt and asks lots of questions about stuff. Doesn't mean John is rude at all.", "NTA.  He should have read the room and stopped after the first time.  And she should apologize. Are you sure your son explained to him that he's being rude and that you're upset, or is he just hoping you'll gloss over this?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
