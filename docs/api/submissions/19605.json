Instead they tried to use your info to refinance a better deal cause their credit isn't good enough. You're not making them homeless, they can always downsize.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are manipulating you, and you shouldn't trust them.  In addition to them trying to trick you into a brand new mortgage (probably at a higher rate), they may also be up to some other shenanigans with the new mortgage.  For instance, your parents may be trying to refinance for more money than they currently owe to pull cash from their equity.  That would definitely make the mortgage unaffordable if they're on a fixed income.\n\nContact the mortgage company and tell them that you wonn't sign on a refinance.  Don't sign on any new mortgage, or any other debt, for your parents.  \n\nStay out of the issue between your parents and sister.  Just refuse to sign any new debts.  And don't sign any sales documents unless there's an individual check at closing for your 0.5% of the net.", "I have many years as a mortgage underwriter - if it can be documented that an obligated party other than your sister has been making the payments for the most recent 12 (or 24) months and there are no late payments in that period reported by the mortgage company, then most mortgage programs will allow the payment to be excluded from her debt to income ratio.  (Some programs may require no other ownership in another property but those are the exception.\n\nNTA - applying for a refinance adds a credit inquiry to your report which can bring down your score.  The new rate would be higher which would also put a bigger drain on your parents limited income.  Seems best for them to not complete this refinance either.", "NTA.  Tell them you are not the one forcing them to sell the house, it is your sister that is pushing the issue.  So they can either take both of your off and sell the house, or they leave both of you on.", "Refinance right now is a terrible idea. Usually, after so long, you can remove someone from the mortgage and the remaining people carry on with the old mortgage, at the lower rate, which they likely can afford since the interest rates were lower then.", "So if you do not sign the refinance paperwork, the original mortgage remains as is with your sister's name on it.\n\nIt seems to me YOU would want your sister's name to remain on the mortgage as she would remain financially responsible, as you would be, rather than you being solely responsible if the mortgage were refinanced.\n\nYour sister's issues are not your issues.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Don't risk your financial future for them. And they asked if you wanted out, you said yes, and this is part of being out.", "NTA.  That aside, there are still some things which can be done:\n\nOption #1: Sell the property (large capital gain from wat you said), pay off the kids, and parents relocate/downsize to a home consistent with their incomes.\n\nOption #2:  Have the kids quit-claim, have the parents do a reverse mortgage, and pay the kids out of the proceeds.\n\nNote: I'm assuming they have a great interest rate and aren't interested in doing a refi at current rates.  Also, I'm assuming there's no income potential for the property -- that parents can't increase their incomes by renting out part of the property (e.g., garage apt.).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They manage fine because they bought when it was still affordable but would spend double that amount for half the size. We live in a HCOL area.", "That\u2019s what I thought. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if my sister wanted equity to purchase a place hence why they need to refinance with my income", "You\u2019re smart to be weary. Honestly, your sister could have gifted your parents the .5% and it\u2019s right to ask why they need your credit, again. The manipulation is worrisome.\n\nGoogle \u201ctransfer mortgage\u201d or go to the bank and ask them how it\u2019s done. It appears that you keep the lower rate and over a decade of payment history should allow them to keep it. If you tell the bank you want to gift it to your parents, you shouldn\u2019t need to prove your income, they will though."]}
