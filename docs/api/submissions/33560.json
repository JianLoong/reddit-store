Planet Fitness threw him out. And frankly, something must have escalated to go from \"hey dude you can't just sit on a machine when people are waiting to use it\" to actually kicking him out.

And your friend is an idiot. It defeats the entire purpose of a circuit to have someone sitting stagnant.", "Absolutely NTA. After asking twice I\u2019d get the gym staff. \n\nIf he wants to sit down instead of working out that\u2019s fine, but do it somewhere else. Or at least a different machine. \n\nI doubt they kick you out for being on your phone at a machine, so I\u2019m guessing either he was rude to the staff or he was planning to leave anyways.", "NTA.

Guy thought he was really on a boat", "You aren't so much the AH as the hero. What he did was selfish and rude even on a regular machine. But the gym has set up an area for everyone to quickly be able to get in a workoout. By messing up that system unnecessarily so he could sit and talk he was thwarting the quick workouts of fellow members. He was also hurting the gym because it wasn't providing the service it promised.\n\nYou spoke to him directly, which was what you should have done. Speaking to him again would have been useless and could have escalated the conflict. You turned it over to the gym to handle, which was the right thing to do.\n\nHe got himself thrown out by committing a violation that the gym felt was severe enough to merit that response. You didn't insist on his eviction. \n\nThanks to your handling this right instead of silently allowing him to continue being disrespectful of others, you have improved the gym experience for those trying to actually use the gym as intended. Conflict is difficult to confront, we want to be polite and easy going. But that doesn't mean you have to be a doormat.", "You didn't get him thrown out. The gym chose to throw him out after interacting with him. You simply let them know what he was doing. NTA.", "NTA wish I could get everyone that does this shit st my gym kicked out", "NTA.

Case closed.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s really not your fault he got thrown out. That was the decision of the staff you informed. Besides you tried to talk to him directly first, and if he hadn\u2019t been a rude jerk then, he wouldn\u2019t have been in this situation to begin with. Besides throwing him out seems like an extreme consequence so I\u2019m guessing he wasa rude jerk to the staff member as well.", "NTA. You did not get him kicked out. He did that all by himself.", "NTA \n\nNot by a long shot. \n\nIt\u2019s bad enough out on the floor, but it\u2019s even worse when it\u2019s within the Express area. That is designed so members can get in a quick workout.", "If I complained every time someone was sitting around at the gym not using the equipment they are parked on I would spend the whole time at the front counter.

You handled it perfectly.\n\nYou didn\u2019t cause a scene and start yelling at the guy. You gave him every chance to snap out of it and display some basic courtesy over a shared space. And when that failed, you notified the person in charge of keeping that public space running and they took care of the problem.\n\nI like how the employee handled it too. It\u2019s an exercise machine, not a public bench. Get your reps done and move on. It\u2019s basic gym courtesy.", "Hi", "YTA - you should have handled it yourself without being a tattletale.

It's one thing to ask someone if you can work in between sets on something that takes awhile to setup like hip thrusts or deadlift (still fine to ask just more reasonable for the person to decline) but a machine?
