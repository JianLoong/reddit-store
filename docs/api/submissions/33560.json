Planet Fitness threw him out. And frankly, something must have escalated to go from \"hey dude you can't just sit on a machine when people are waiting to use it\" to actually kicking him out. He's obv a jerk who did/said something to the staff after being confronted. NTA", "NTA. You asked him multiple times and by pretending to use the equipment and then going back on his phone, it was clear he knew what he was doing. If he wanted to sit and play on his phone, he could stay home on his couch.", "NTA. He's hogging the equipment, but not using it. People pay to go there - it's a business.", "NTA. And your friend is an idiot. It defeats the entire purpose of a circuit to have someone sitting stagnant.", "Absolutely NTA. After asking twice I\u2019d get the gym staff. \n\nIf he wants to sit down instead of working out that\u2019s fine, but do it somewhere else. Or at least a different machine. \n\nI doubt they kick you out for being on your phone at a machine, so I\u2019m guessing either he was rude to the staff or he was planning to leave anyways.", "NTA. He's the kind of guy that's on his phone at a theater and he should get thrown out there too.", "NtA. lol what is wrong with people???? Guy thought he was really on a boat", "You aren't so much the AH as the hero. What he did was selfish and rude even on a regular machine. But the gym has set up an area for everyone to quickly be able to get in a workoout. By messing up that system unnecessarily so he could sit and talk he was thwarting the quick workouts of fellow members. He was also hurting the gym because it wasn't providing the service it promised.\n\nYou spoke to him directly, which was what you should have done. Speaking to him again would have been useless and could have escalated the conflict. You turned it over to the gym to handle, which was the right thing to do.\n\nHe got himself thrown out by committing a violation that the gym felt was severe enough to merit that response. You didn't insist on his eviction. \n\nThanks to your handling this right instead of silently allowing him to continue being disrespectful of others, you have improved the gym experience for those trying to actually use the gym as intended. Conflict is difficult to confront, we want to be polite and easy going. But that doesn't mean you have to be a doormat.", "You didn't get him thrown out. The gym chose to throw him out after interacting with him. You simply let them know what he was doing. NTA.", "NTA wish I could get everyone that does this shit st my gym kicked out", "NTA. I look at my phone between reps but not for more than a few minutes. He was hogging the machine. You asked him nicely and he blew you off. So you did what you had to do. Case closed.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s really not your fault he got thrown out. That was the decision of the staff you informed. Besides you tried to talk to him directly first, and if he hadn\u2019t been a rude jerk then, he wouldn\u2019t have been in this situation to begin with. Besides throwing him out seems like an extreme consequence so I\u2019m guessing he wasa rude jerk to the staff member as well.", "NTA. You did not get him kicked out. He did that all by himself.", "NTA \n\nNot by a long shot. \n\nIt\u2019s bad enough out on the floor, but it\u2019s even worse when it\u2019s within the Express area. That is designed so members can get in a quick workout.", "If I complained every time someone was sitting around at the gym not using the equipment they are parked on I would spend the whole time at the front counter. Is it bad etiquette? Sure. Can you move on or find something to hit the same muscle group? Also, sure...", "Yes", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I also go to PF and the people who don't use the 30 minute express zone as intended irritate the ever living daylights out of me. All of those machines are available on the floor, go monopolize them out there, not where people are trying obviously to do a circuit. I've never had the balls to complain about them though.", "NTA. If you're going to go to the gym and do one rep every ten minutes, you're not adhering to generally agreed-upon gym etiquette, and it seems the staff agreed with you.\n\nDon't worry about it, do your think and stay in shape.", "NTA  your not supposed to do multiple sets in the express room let alone sit there.", "NtA.  This monopolizing equipment to dick around on your phone is inconsiderate and bad gym etiquette.  Stand up and let someone else use the machine ffs", "NTA dude was doing that on purpose", "You asked him and he refused.

I asked him politely if I could use the machine he was on and he told me no because he was using it to watch tiktoks", "Literally. I saw a kid there once who went back-and-forth using two of the machines in one of the circuit training corners, and at one point he got up to go to the bathroom, and someone else had started using it.
