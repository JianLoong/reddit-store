Her rent had increased a lot, and her landlord was slow in making repairs. Our parents (M53 and F52) offered to store most of her belongings in our basement until she finds a new place to live in for when she starts school again in the Fall.\r\n\nOur house's basement has kinda been my personal space where I usually hang out with my friends or play video games. However, with Sarah's things are taking up nearly all the space, and there is no longer any space for me and my buddies. I understand she's in a tough spot, but I am becoming more annoyed with this.\r\n\nYesterday evening, I sat down with my dad and told him that I needed some space in the basement. \rMy dad listened and said that he acknowledged my situation. He said that he understood the inconvenience, but kept mentioning that Sarah was in a tough spot and that the arrangement was temporary. When I pointed its been four weeks, he again asked for my patience.\r\n\nWhen I tried to continue the conversation, my dad interrupted me. He suggested that he could pay me \"rent for the basement\" and allow Sarah's belongings to stay there. He started pulling out his wallet  and everything. I was annoyed by this, as I thought he was being dismissive and I refused his offer.\r  \n\r  \nMy dad was pretty surprised by this, and rescinded his offer and apologized for \"not fully listening to me\". He then said that he was serious about paying me for the remaining time that the basement was being occupied, but I yelled at him saying that he had completely missed what I was telling him.\n\nHe got frustrated and said that I needed to be more empathetic. When I tried to speak up again, he told me that ther was no longer anything to discuss.

You don\u2019t have to pay rent, you have no idea how the real world works and it\u2019s obvious. \n\nI\u2019m 20 and still living with my parents because rent is fucking tough. However, if one of my siblings needed to store their stuff in my personal room - no matter how much I hated it - I\u2019d let them and we\u2019d work it out.\n\nThis isn\u2019t even YOUR ROOM, it\u2019s the basement. You don\u2019t pay rent bud, it\u2019s not your house. Your father is an incredible man for being so patient. This isn\u2019t your house. You and your buddies can find a new place, figure it out. Show some love towards your sister. She\u2019s your damn sister. \n\nYou should be ashamed. YTA 100%", "Yta.  Your being an entitled little brat grow up", "YTA\n\nNot your house bro.", "YTA, you are lucky he even offered you compensation for not being able to access a room that he owns. I would have told you tough luck. Stop acting so entitled and realize the world doesn't revolve around your wants.", "YTA - It's not your house.  It's not your basement.  It's your parent's.  They can let your sister use 100% of it if they want and kick you out of it completely.  It's ridiculous that your dad even offered to pay you a single dime for letting her use it.  Stop acting like an entitled, spoiled brat.  Your sister needs a temporary place to store her stuff.  Find another place to game or hang out with your friends for a few weeks or months.", "YTA. Your sister is in a tough spot, it\u2019s only been a month, I\u2019m sure you can make do in your bedroom for as long as she needs.", "YTA. The fact that your dad made sure you felt heard and was willing to make accommodations you aren\u2019t owed, big big entitled vibes.", "YTA. Sometimes we have to be temporarily inconvenienced in order to help out family and friends who have a greater need. That's life. Get used to it. Grow up and start thinking about somebody besides yourself.", "YTA. I'm assuming you're still underage, but if you still live with your parents after you turn 18, or have the need to keep any of your stuff stored at their house, I really hope they decide to make you pay rent. \n\nMaybe once you've grown up some & have to deal with paying your own way, you'll have more empathy for your sister & her situation.", "YTA.  It's not your house, and you are demanding all the space in the basement?  Damn, that's some entitlement.", "YTA you sister has found herself homeless and had to return home, instead of helping out and being uderstanding you go to your dad whining that \"boo hoo I cant hang out in the basement with my loser mates anymore\", its your parents house so perhaps you should be the one paying extra rent for using the basement, really just grow up kid you are acting like a spoilt 7 year old who needs a good spanking - do you even like your sister?", "YTA\n\nWould be a different story if the basement functioned as your bedroom. But let me get this straight, in a house that you do not own or pay rent in (not that you should at 17) you have 2 spaces that are entirely your own. Your own room, and this hangout spot. That\u2019s really nice, but that is not something you\u2019re owed. Your dad was incredibly kind to offer to pay you money for a space that he/your parents own. Also, your sister is only 21. It\u2019s more than ok that her stuff is stored down there.\n\n\nYou are being very entitled, especially with the \u201cwell it\u2019s already been 4 weeks.\u201d Do you know how hard housing is at the moment? Cost of living for young adults? Yeah, she\u2019s back for the summer to save money and not dig herself into a hole she can\u2019t get out of. You said that you \u201cunderstand she\u2019s in a tough spot\u201d but I don\u2019t think you actually understand the gravity of this situation. If you did, you wouldn\u2019t think that your \u201cneed\u201d to have 2 entirely separate spaces just for yourself is more important than her living crisis. As a young woman about your sister\u2019s age living independently, I can tell you first hand how hard it is to navigate rent increases, trying to find an affordable place and bad landlords. \n\n\nYou expect your father to be empathetic to you, which he definitely has been, to a greater degree than most parents. Most parents would have said to suck it up because you have your own room and this is their home. But you expect more than empathy, you want things your way or no way, showing an extreme lack of empathy toward your sister. \n\n\nThink about things outside of your own bubble for a second. You can find another hangout place at 17, your sister is facing a much bigger problem at the moment.", "YTA. You are entitled brat. Your parents are doing right by your sister and your dad was trying to defuse a situation with you. If it would be me, you would not be allowed to use basement even after your sister\u2019s thing were removed", "YTA and entitled as hell. It's your home yes, but not your house. You don't own it or pay any bills. Time to grow the hell up.", "YTA sounds like a bad plot line of that 70s show", "LOL YTA it\u2019s your parents house you should be thankful they even let you use the basement as your own space. The fact that your dad offered you money to stop your complaining which is ridiculous and you had the audacity to yell at him shows what a spoiled brat they raised. You should be ashamed of yourself and apologize while your parents should start storing their own things in the basement taking the space away from you as punishment for being such an ungrateful brat", "YTA. Hands down, no questions. He even tried to pay you. It\u2019s his house, he can do whatever he wants with it.", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry that your sister was forced to move back home for a while.  It's nothing she is thrilled with either.  While it may feel like an eternity it's only going to be a couple of months and she will be back to school and you can have you happy hang out place again.\n\nFind someplace new to hang out for the summer.  These are things that happen with family.  It may happen with you someday too.", "YTA. It's fairly normal to be self centered and entitled at your age, but at some point, you need to learn that the world doesn't revolve around you. The basement may have traditionally been your space, but it's still your parents' basement. They're helping your sister out, most likely temporarily, which is the right thing force them for do. You have absolutely no right to complain.", ">Yesterday evening, I sat down with my dad and told him that I needed some space in the basement. \n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t tho. Objectively and seriously, you don\u2019t need it. You want it, and your parents have been very kind to let you use it. They have clearly raised you to be entitled, as most parents wouldn\u2019t consider paying you for the inconvenience of losing out on your extra space, and you are so entitled that you don\u2019t even take the deal. I hope your dad takes away his offer for money and doesn\u2019t give you the room back even after your sister stops needing it, as you are not appreciative of it.", "YTA. \n\nIt's not your basement. \n\nUnless that is your only actually room where you sleep, you have no argument here. \n\nThe basement is the property of your parents, and if you have a safe, private space- I'm assuming you have your own bedroom- then if they want to make the basement storage for your sister instead of a hang out for your friends, well that's the end of it. \n\nYour Dad was very kind to entertain your complaint and to try and make things better. Your want of hangout space is not a NEED, it is just something you like, and your sister having to leave her apartment and store her stuff is something that any rational person would prioritize, and any parent certainly would. \n\nYou have no right to be annoyed, and while I respect your desire to be \"heard\" you should understand that you were HEARD. Your Dad listened, he empathized, he offered a compromise by offering up some cash. He just didn't agree to what YOU wanted, which was more space in the basement to hang out. You need to learn the difference between being heard and having things your way.", "YTA.  Not your house.  Try to be more like your father as you get older", "YTA and super entitled. Frankly, your dad is also TA for enabling this behavior. \n\nYou better get your head right ASAP or you are in for the shock of a lifetime when you get out into the real world.", "YTA. It's not your house and no one owes you anything. Your sister is in a tough spot and you're focused on hanging with your buddies. Tough.", "yta. it's a fun luxury space, that is now needed for something else. for a house that you do not own. find another hangout spot. life happens sometimes.", "YTA and at age 17 you should be/embarassed/ashamed of yourself. For the short term you and your friends can hang out somewhere else. Your father was right there isn't anything left to discuss. He did not miss anything his toddler son had to say.\n\nDepending when your next birthday is maybe you can move out and see what ir is like.", "He offered to pay rent for his own basement and you refused? \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\n\nLike he doesn't need to do that. The fact is just because you called dibs doesn't mean you're the only one allowed to use it. Grow up. YTA", "YTA and privileged besides. Technically your parents fault for raising you this way but it's not an excuse on your part to not change it. Grow up.", "I\u2019m going to start with a suggestion. Instead of your parents paying you rent to use their own basement, you should ask your parents to help Sarah move everything from the basement into a storage unit. Either that, or have her compress her boxes and get rid of unnecessary furniture.\n\nAs for my verdict\u2026 YTA. But you\u2019re not even 18. Your sense of entitlement is thus far from terminal, and the fact that you\u2019re assessing your actions is a sign to me that you\u2019ll outgrow it in the next couple years. That said, still - YTA for now.\n\nIt\u2019s not your space. You may be accustomed to having it to hang out, but your father is literally offering you money for a space that he already owns. Your father is a saint for being so patient with you. He is trying to offer you a consolation prize for the inconvenience of losing a luxury, and you spat in his face.\n\nI get the desire for space for your friends. Most people do. Your father obviously does more than you think he does. But your sister got her first unpleasant helping of adult life in a very cruel way. Moving back in with parents can be humiliating and comes with it a lot of societal stigma. She might be dealing with that, in addition to the tacit financial difficulties and housing insecurity. Your sister\u2019s needs trump your wants - both in your parents\u2019 eyes, and from a moral point of view.", "YTA. And you don\u2019t deserve \u201crent.\u201d It\u2019s not your house. Go hang at one of your friends\u2019 homes.", "Definitely the asshole...not only is it not even ur house, but u shamed ur dad for trying to alleviate the stress of a temporary loss of space!", "YTA. It\u2019s a temporary situation so just suck it up. Your parents are just trying to help out their daughter and you\u2019re making it about you. Maybe if you paid rent you\u2019d have an argument but you don\u2019t, so no.", "YTA. Just because you didn\u2019t get your way doesn\u2019t mean you were not listened to. Your dad was taking the piss out of you in an attempt to get you to realize how entitled you were being.", "I usually don\u2019t comment whenever the overwhelming majority think someone is TA. But bro, YTA.", "YTA. Don't be surprised when you yourself are in this situation in a few years.", "YTA. By 18, your dad can kick you out or charge you rent. It\u2019s not your house. Get over it.", "YTA.  Who owns the house?", "YTA - the entitlement of this.", "Dude wtf. That is not your space. It is your parents space that they are letting you use. You are being childish. YTA", "YTA look I get that it sucks that you\u2019ve lost your space and it\u2019s frustrating but it\u2019s a bonus room it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve been kicked out of your bedroom. You don\u2019t NEED the space you want it. On the other hand your sister does NEED somewhere to store her things, she can\u2019t afford to just trash everything and buy new. \n\nI\u2019m currently a student struggling with rent shooting up, so speaking from experience this probably isn\u2019t ideal for your sister either. You want independence and freedom as a young adult but finding somewhere affordable to live is a nightmare. It\u2019s kind of scary wondering how your gonna survive when food and housing is so expensive and you can only make so much in a week. I\u2019m insanely grateful to have supportive parents to help me out. I bet your sister is to. Look at this as an example of the treatment you can expect in your early twenties trust me you\u2019ll be grateful for it then. \n\nIf I was you I\u2019d take the money and be very dam happy with it. You aren\u2019t paying rent, it\u2019s not your house and your parents have every right to use their basement. They don\u2019t need to rent it from you, my parents certainly wouldn\u2019t give my sisters money to use a space outside their bedrooms in the house. Your dad isn\u2019t wrong about you needing to be more empathetic. Your sister has nowhere else to go and it\u2019s coming across like you\u2019d happily toss all her stuff in the trash because it inconveniences you.

Her rent had increased a lot, and her landlord was slow in making repairs. Our parents (M53 and F52) offered to store most of her belongings in our basement until she finds a new place to live in for when she starts school again in the Fall.\r\n\nOur house's basement has kinda been my personal space where I usually hang out with my friends or play video games. However, with Sarah's things are taking up nearly all the space, and there is no longer any space for me and my buddies. I understand she's in a tough spot, but I am becoming more annoyed with this.\r\n\nYesterday evening, I sat down with my dad and told him that I needed some space in the basement. \rMy dad listened and said that he acknowledged my situation. He said that he understood the inconvenience, but kept mentioning that Sarah was in a tough spot and that the arrangement was temporary. When I pointed its been four weeks, he again asked for my patience.\r\n\nWhen I tried to continue the conversation, my dad interrupted me. He suggested that he could pay me \"rent for the basement\" and allow Sarah's belongings to stay there. He started pulling out his wallet  and everything. I was annoyed by this, as I thought he was being dismissive and I refused his offer.\r  \n\r  \nMy dad was pretty surprised by this, and rescinded his offer and apologized for \"not fully listening to me\".

Your sister is having life altering terrible real shit happen to her, and you\u2019re worrying about a circle jerk space for you and your buds? You\u2019re a horrible brother and entitled spoiled little child. Your dad was being generous, I hope you don\u2019t get any money from him for this. Maybe learn some empathy, and you\u2019ll become a halfway decent human being, but I won\u2019t hold my breath.", "YTA It's not your house, it belongs to your parents. They pay the mortgage.  Your dad is better than I would ever be. I would have told you that this is what is happening right now, so suck it up buttercup", "YTA. I can kind of see how your parents trying to be reasonable and generous with you have inadvertently raised a selfish brat. It\u2019s their house, their basement, unless you pay the mortgage, it\u2019s a privilege to live there.", "YTA - it is temporary and your sister is in a bind. Be happy that you have a home. Go to your friends houses if you need a hangout spot that bad.", "YTA. Nobody in this situation owes you ANYTHING. Yet you act like you own the house. You are an entitled little brat and should be ashamed of yourself. Honestly I would feel embarrassed if I were you. Your behavior is utterly embarrassing. Your dad owns the house and the room and yet YOU are entitled to it? Move out and buy your own house if you want to make demands about how the space is parsed out. Go apologize to your family and think about how shitty you are being.", "YTA. Grow up.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your house or your basement. It belongs to your parents. If they want to temporarily store your sister\u2019s things there, then that\u2019s their right. Your Dad was being nice by offering you \u2018rent\u2019. You were silly for not taking it since he didn\u2019t have to give you anything.", "YTA. Grow up, you're acting like a little brat. That is their house and can do what they want with the basement. You don't always get what you want, time to learn that life lesson.  Get over it.", "YTA, the sense of entitlement is unreal. You don't need the whole ass basement in general, so not having it for a couple of months sounds pretty reasonable. Also, more a side note, but your dad offered to PAY you for this. It's extremely sad that he has to do this because of how lacking you are, and it's also probably the dumbest decision ever to reject that lmao.", "YTA grow up you spoiled little turd.", "YTA. Are you paying rent to occupy the basement for you and your buddies? Do you own the house? No? Then deal with the inconvenience of your sister's emergency move-in. Your dad is right: there's nothing more to discuss here.", "you\u2019re being entitled to a house/space that already belongs to your parents. This new generation I tell you", "YTA. Bless your dad and his patience and understanding. Way better response than what I would have said to you", "YTA. \nYou lost total access to your clubhouse for a few weeks.  You don\u2019t own that house, it isn\u2019t your private bedroom, and your dad tried to compromise.  Maybe you can move down there and she can store her stuff in your bedroom.  That\u2019s pretty entitled though", "YTA. I'm sorry, you have your own bedroom in a house that you don't pay for, and you're complaining that you can't hang out in your parents' basement for a few weeks as your sister urgently needed it? What were they supposed to do, let her go homeless so that you can play more video games with your buddies? Grow the hell up.", " YTA. This is a joke, right? Your sister can\u2019t afford her rent and the place sounds like a shithole of the landlord \u201cis slow to repair.\u201d It\u2019s not your home and it\u2019s not your bedroom, it\u2019s literally just a space you want to hang out in. Seriously, stop being a spoilt brat and apologize to your dad.", "YTA and honestly your dad is kinda enabling you by playing along. It is not your house. You do not pay rent. You are not entitled to any space besides your bathroom", "YTA and dumb lol, free money come one.", "YTA I see it now. You\u2019ll be living with your parents forever because you have no idea what it\u2019s like in the real world.", "This has to be made up. Good heavens, OP, you're so very YTA. If you really don't know & have to ask strangers to judge your behavior, you're an even bigger AH than your question implies.", "YTA. Your sister has fallen on hard times while furthering her education, the least you could do is store some of her stuff in the basement. Unless you\u2019re leaving out some extenuating details about her abusing you, YTA, accept that her stuff has to be stored in the basement for a bit.", "Seriously? Dude you're the asshole", "For refusing the bribe? N T A, that was the appropriate thing to do. \n\nFor believing you are entitled to your parents basement, YTA. Your sister has every right to store her stuff there, infact she has more of a right as the homeowners have alloted her the space to use. Stop being such a spoiled brat and suck it up.", "YTA. Do not be surprised if when you move out and something bad happens your family is not willing to help you. You still have the protections of a child. Your sister probably feels extremely guilty even taking up the space. Y'all kids need to go outside and touch grass instead of literally rotting in your mom's basement complaining on Reddit.", "How small is that basement lol, but yeah you're kind of being TA", "YTA, I swear to god. If I had sat my mother and father down and complained about how they were using their basement like I had some claim to the space, they would have laughed their asses off and then told me to kick rocks.", "So your dad was willing to pay you for something he already owned?  Yta, and a brat. I hate to see you as an adult.  \ud83e\udd23 I wish one of my sons would pull some crap like this.", "YTA.\nAnd your dad is also an a**hole and that's why you are an  entitled brat.", "Wow you're being such an entitled spoiled brat \n\n\n\n1. It's not your house it's your parents house. They get final say\n\n\n2. The room your sister is TEMPORARILY storing her belongings in is a public space, not exclusively yours like your bedroom is.\n\n\n\n3. Your dad is right, your need to be more empathetic. Your lack of empathy for your sister who's in a tough spot is honestly alarming. You have a lot of growing up to do.\n\n\n\n\nYTA you owe your dad an apology.\n\n\n\nETA I pity any future roommates you may have. With your attitude and behavior, you're on track to being a roommate from hell.", "Did you stomp your feet and slam the door behind you? Boo hoo you can't have MORE space than what you already have because Sarah needs to store her necessities while getting adequate housing.\n\nStop acting like a child. YTA.", "YTA - an extremely entitled child. Not your house or your basement. Your parents are doing a very nice thing for your sister. Have some empathy for your own family. Go to one of your buddies house or go outside and play.", "YTA\n\nIt's your parents house and the only things they're required to provide you is food clothing and shelter. If they want to store your sister's things indefinitely that would be their right.\n\nYou presumably have a bedroom and aren't ENTITLED to a place to \"hangout\" outside that\n\nFrankly though he was in no way obligated to make the offer to \"pay you rent\" on HIS BASEMENT I'd have snatched it up.", "YTA. Your parents have two children, not one.", "YTA, you're living rent free with your parents, you're not entitled to anything except arguably your own bedroom. Your dad was nice enough to offer you money to rent HIS property from you, what else were you expecting from the conversation? Were you honestly expecting him to kick her out?", "YTA- I\u2019d understand if you didn\u2019t have a bedroom but I\u2019m assuming you have a bedroom and the basement so I don\u2019t understand the issue. You need some alone time then sit in your room. Not many people have more than one room to themselves in their house when they are living with their parents so why do you feel entitled to have 2 room. Also it\u2019s your parents house and your such a brat they are literally going to pay you for the basement even though I assume you contribute nothing to the house itself.", "YTA. Hang out somewhere else for the summer. Don't be so entitled. What do you want to happen, exactly?", "YTA. You\u2019re young so I understand the ignorance. \n\n>When I pointed out it\u2019s been four weeks, he again asked for my patience \n\nAnd he\u2019s absolutely not wrong. The economy is terrible right now, finding a suitable place to live in four weeks is nearly impossible. It took me four *months* to get a new apartment and my rent is now doubled, with no utilities included.\n\nYou\u2019re annoyed that you can\u2019t hang out in the basement with your friends? Imagine how your sister feels, dude. She is without a place of her own at the moment. Your parents don\u2019t sound like the type to let her go homeless, but the fact remains that she is technically \u201chomeless\u201d and you\u2019re more worried about hanging with your friends. \n\nLearn some compassion. And enjoy whatever time you can with your friends because the real world is going to railroad you.", "YTA \n\n\u2026.your entitlement is shocking tbh \n\nYou have a bedroom. That\u2019s what you\u2019re entitled to for personal space. \n\nCome on OP.", "LOLOLOL. Yes. YTA. It's not your house, you just live in it, and your father was overly generous offering to \"rent\" it from you.\n\nI'm guessing that since you're 17, you haven't lived on your own yet. Or had a full time job. Or had to pay all your bills. I hope not anyway, but the thing is: with that comes the understanding that four weeks to find an apartment isn't always enough. \n\nYour sister is having a hard time, and I suspect everyone will remember your tantrum when you are having a hard time when you're a young adult and not an entirely dependent minor child.", "Wow, you are so seriously the AH here - and an extremely entitled one at that.", "Oh my god do I have some choice words for you.\n\nYeah yta, and an entitled selfish brat to boot. It's not your basement, it's your parents, and right now your sister needs it way more then you do.\n\nSeriously, why can't you just hangout in your room instead? Or the living room? Or at a different friend's house? Or outside? There's literally so many different options.", "I typically do not vote on teen posts, but this one right here. I thought OP was going to say he had to give up his room.  No - he had to give up some of the basement. I hope OP recovers from this trying trying time.", "YTA and your dad seems like a really cool guy. I wish i had a dad like that.", "ESH. Everyone has already covered why you're the AH. It's not your house, not your rules. Your sister is going through a rough time, and you should be empathetic to what she's going through. \n\nThat said, you're under 18. It's not like you have a lot of choice in the matter. It's not as though you could rent your own apartment, even if you wanted to, so you're kinda stuck. You had some personal space in the house, and your parents took it away from you without consulting you. That sucks. \n\nBut what makes your dad an AH is offering to pay. You're right, he wasn't listening to you. It's incredibly insensitive for him to think it's as simple as just giving you money when they didn't take your feelings into account in the first place.", "YTA and you\u2019re a brat.", "YTA...Unless the basement is also your bedroom. Since you didn't say this, I'm assuming not. Hang out in your bedroom and let your parents (you know, who own the house?) do with their space what they please.", "YTA\n\nAnd its disturbing that you cannot see why.", "INFO: Do you own the house or does it belong to your parents? And if its your parents house, why do you think its your place to decide what can be stored in the basement? I'm confused.", "Can you make your room into a space for your buddies to hang?", "Yta", "\"kinda been my space\" \n\n\nSo let me get this straight, you have a whole bedroom, but also want the entire basement to be yours in a house you don't own when your sister is in crisis mode? That's like trying to claim the family living room as your second private room. Huge YTA", "It's not your basement. While you have enjoyed the use of it, for the summer, its job is to house your sisters belongings, which will be moved on or around the 1st of September (I lived in Boston - this is THE moving day for the entire city).\n\nSo, for the next month or so, you and your friends will have to find some other place to hang out.", "Yeah, YTA kid.  It's not your house.  And your sister is in a bind.  Your parents are being parents and doing a good thing.  Get over yourself.  Your father offered a very (more than in my opinion) fair offer to you.  You blew it.  Learn some empathy and patience.", "YTA. You dad is trying so hard to take care of his daughter and be understanding of how this affects you. He listened, he showed empathy,  and he tried to make it up to you by giving you money when he didn't even have to do. You still have your own room, correct? Hang out there and learn to be more empathic, like your dad.", "YTA. Take the money and buy a garden shed maybe", "YTA. They offered to store your sister\u2019s belongings and your parents pay for the space\u2026.game time is not important to anyone but you. Maybe you should work more hours or study in your room some more because you are so out of line it\u2019s incredible", "YTA.\n\nKinda your personal space isn\u2019t your personal space. I\u2019m assuming by that you mean you use it the most. \n\nIt\u2019s your parents house you don\u2019t get much of a say. Honestly your dad was super accommodating (I\u2019ll be it weird) in offering to pay you \u201crent\u201d. \n\nI get it\u2019s frustrating but so is life, time to grow up a little and realize not everything is about you nor will work out perfectly.", "YTA. Quit the entitlement.", "YTA you're an entitled little child and your dad's TA for enabling your crappy behavior.", "Omg ESH because you\u2019re an entitled brat and your parents because they are failing raising you.\nYou don\u2019t own the house. Your sister literally became homeless and you\u2019re worried about not having an area to hangout with friends????? There are so many real freaking problems, one of them is taking up room in your basement. Grow the hell up.", "The fact he thinks his sister should have magically achieved something in 4 weeks in this economy and rental crisis\u2019 globally is more than enough to show how na\u00efve and out of touch he is. He has a lot to learn before he one day moves out\u2026", "Yeah OP, definitely YTA. Your sister is going through a hard time and your parents are trying to help her. Your dad offered you money as a gesture of appreciation and compromise, not as a bribe. You were rude and ungrateful to him. You need to grow up and share the space. It\u2019s not yours alone.", "Makes me wonder...what kind of teenager declines an offer for free money from their parents???", "The dad offering money is crazy to me. OP is 17 and thinks he owns the basement, that\u2019s wild. Also, to keep pushing your dad and saying he isn\u2019t listening when you are completely clueless.", "Top comment!", "his parents are codling him waaaay too much... so i completely agree with the 'pushover' statement. especially since the dad *offered rent money* to OP, the dad pays rent to his son, in his own house \ud83d\ude02 what mad world are we living in???", "Omg, you win", "He's not losing a summer with his friends. They're not banishing him to Siberia. What are you talking about? His friends can't hang out in a million different places?", "He\u2019s not losing a summer with his friends. He still has his own room to hang out in and at 17 I\u2019m assuming one of them has access to a car and a license to drive places. Even if not, there are many options for hangout spots beyond this one basement space that does not belong to him despite his frequent use of it.", "How is OP NTA in your opinion? This is utterly assholy behavior and I don't see, how anyone could see it in any other way.", "How are the dad and sister assholes?", "\"It's not yours alone.\"  it's actually not yours at all to dictate OP. they are just usually the ones using it. Where is your room in all this.\n\nPart of it is that you are pretty young, so a month is still an eternity, but realistically, the stuff has an exit plan, and you know when it is. You need to adjust to hang out at another house, a park, a youth center, behind the bleachers. It's family space, yes, but if your dad set up a home gym in the basement, he still wouldn't be the asshole. It's your parents' house. So long as you have a room and bed and open use of the communal spaces, it's not really yours to dictate.", "The kind so spoiled that money is no object\u2026.", "It was wild to me too at first. I\u2019m not a parent but I think I get what dad was going for, even if it was subconscious. \u201cYour argument is so ridiculous I\u2019d rather pay you to shut up than listen to you.\u201d", "I was thinking the same thing. The basement can not be the only place to hang out. And even if it was, the parents own the house and get to decide how the space is used. Time to find a new hang out spot."]}
