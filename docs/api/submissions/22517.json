Her rent had increased a lot, and her landlord was slow in making repairs. Our parents (M53 and F52) offered to store most of her belongings in our basement until she finds a new place to live in for when she starts school again in the Fall.\n\nOur house's basement has kinda been my personal space where I usually hang out with my friends or play video games. However, with Sarah's things are taking up nearly all the space, and there is no longer any space for me and my buddies. I understand she's in a tough spot, but I am becoming more annoyed with this.\n\nYesterday evening, I sat down with my dad and told him that I needed some space in the basement. My dad listened and said that he acknowledged my situation. He said that he understood the inconvenience, but kept mentioning that Sarah was in a tough spot and that the arrangement was temporary. When I pointed its been four weeks, he again asked for my patience.\n\nWhen I tried to continue the conversation, my dad interrupted me. He suggested that he could pay me \"rent for the basement\" and allow Sarah's belongings to stay there. He started pulling out his wallet  and everything. I was annoyed by this, as I thought he was being dismissive and I refused his offer.\n\nMy dad was pretty surprised by this, and rescinded his offer and apologized for \"not fully listening to me\". He then said that he was serious about paying me for the remaining time that the basement was being occupied, but I yelled at him saying that he had completely missed what I was telling him.\n\nHe got frustrated and said that I needed to be more empathetic. When I tried to speak up again, he told me that ther was no longer anything to discuss. AITA?\n\nUPDATE - For those wondering, yeah, I've got my own room. But it isn't nearly as spacious as the basement. Anyway, I mentioned my irritation with the situation to my mom this evening (as I don't think my Dad will be receptive to it anymore), and she thinks that I'M being unfair. She said while she does understand that I'm upset, this was the only tenable solution and that I had to be more accommodating (and how I have other options for space). She even said that \"right now Sarah's need for that space trumps yours.\"\r  \n\r  \nI wanted to press the issue further, but my mom started giving me her \"you're in trouble if you keep talking\" face, so I decided to drop it. I understand that Sarah's in a tough spot, but I can't help but feel that I'm being overlooked and ignored by my parents.\r", "created_utc": 1689631965, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152fr5z/aita_for_not_accepting_my_dads_bribe/", "score": 670, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don\u2019t have to pay rent, you have no idea how the real world works and it\u2019s obvious. \n\nI\u2019m 20 and still living with my parents because rent is fucking tough. However, if one of my siblings needed to store their stuff in my personal room - no matter how much I hated it - I\u2019d let them and we\u2019d work it out.\n\nThis isn\u2019t even YOUR ROOM, it\u2019s the basement. You don\u2019t pay rent bud, it\u2019s not your house. Your father is an incredible man for being so patient. This isn\u2019t your house. You and your buddies can find a new place, figure it out. Show some love towards your sister. She\u2019s your damn sister. \n\nYou should be ashamed. YTA 100%", "Yta.  Your being an entitled little brat grow up", "YTA\n\nNot your house bro.", "YTA, you are lucky he even offered you compensation for not being able to access a room that he owns. I would have told you tough luck. Stop acting so entitled and realize the world doesn't revolve around your wants.", "YTA - It's not your house.  It's not your basement.  It's your parent's.  They can let your sister use 100% of it if they want and kick you out of it completely.  It's ridiculous that your dad even offered to pay you a single dime for letting her use it.  Stop acting like an entitled, spoiled brat.  Your sister needs a temporary place to store her stuff.  Find another place to game or hang out with your friends for a few weeks or months.", "YTA. Your sister is in a tough spot, it\u2019s only been a month, I\u2019m sure you can make do in your bedroom for as long as she needs.", "YTA. The fact that your dad made sure you felt heard and was willing to make accommodations you aren\u2019t owed, big big entitled vibes.", "YTA. Sometimes we have to be temporarily inconvenienced in order to help out family and friends who have a greater need. That's life. Get used to it. Grow up and start thinking about somebody besides yourself.", "YTA. I'm assuming you're still underage, but if you still live with your parents after you turn 18, or have the need to keep any of your stuff stored at their house, I really hope they decide to make you pay rent. \n\nMaybe once you've grown up some & have to deal with paying your own way, you'll have more empathy for your sister & her situation.", "YTA.  It's not your house, and you are demanding all the space in the basement?  Damn, that's some entitlement.", "YTA you sister has found herself homeless and had to return home, instead of helping out and being uderstanding you go to your dad whining that \"boo hoo I cant hang out in the basement with my loser mates anymore\", its your parents house so perhaps you should be the one paying extra rent for using the basement, really just grow up kid you are acting like a spoilt 7 year old who needs a good spanking - do you even like your sister?", "YTA\n\nWould be a different story if the basement functioned as your bedroom. But let me get this straight, in a house that you do not own or pay rent in (not that you should at 17) you have 2 spaces that are entirely your own. Your own room, and this hangout spot. That\u2019s really nice, but that is not something you\u2019re owed. Your dad was incredibly kind to offer to pay you money for a space that he/your parents own. Also, your sister is only 21. It\u2019s more than ok that her stuff is stored down there.\n\n\nYou are being very entitled, especially with the \u201cwell it\u2019s already been 4 weeks.\u201d Do you know how hard housing is at the moment? Cost of living for young adults? Yeah, she\u2019s back for the summer to save money and not dig herself into a hole she can\u2019t get out of. You said that you \u201cunderstand she\u2019s in a tough spot\u201d but I don\u2019t think you actually understand the gravity of this situation. If you did, you wouldn\u2019t think that your \u201cneed\u201d to have 2 entirely separate spaces just for yourself is more important than her living crisis. As a young woman about your sister\u2019s age living independently, I can tell you first hand how hard it is to navigate rent increases, trying to find an affordable place and bad landlords. \n\n\nYou expect your father to be empathetic to you, which he definitely has been, to a greater degree than most parents. Most parents would have said to suck it up because you have your own room and this is their home. But you expect more than empathy, you want things your way or no way, showing an extreme lack of empathy toward your sister. \n\n\nThink about things outside of your own bubble for a second. You can find another hangout place at 17, your sister is facing a much bigger problem at the moment.", "YTA. You are entitled brat. Your parents are doing right by your sister and your dad was trying to defuse a situation with you. If it would be me, you would not be allowed to use basement even after your sister\u2019s thing were removed", "YTA and entitled as hell. It's your home yes, but not your house. You don't own it or pay any bills. Time to grow the hell up.", "YTA sounds like a bad plot line of that 70s show", "LOL YTA it\u2019s your parents house you should be thankful they even let you use the basement as your own space. The fact that your dad offered you money to stop your complaining which is ridiculous and you had the audacity to yell at him shows what a spoiled brat they raised. You should be ashamed of yourself and apologize while your parents should start storing their own things in the basement taking the space away from you as punishment for being such an ungrateful brat", "YTA. Hands down, no questions. He even tried to pay you. It\u2019s his house, he can do whatever he wants with it.", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry that your sister was forced to move back home for a while.  It's nothing she is thrilled with either.  While it may feel like an eternity it's only going to be a couple of months and she will be back to school and you can have you happy hang out place again.\n\nFind someplace new to hang out for the summer.  These are things that happen with family.  It may happen with you someday too.", "YTA. It's fairly normal to be self centered and entitled at your age, but at some point, you need to learn that the world doesn't revolve around you. The basement may have traditionally been your space, but it's still your parents' basement. They're helping your sister out, most likely temporarily, which is the right thing force them for do. You have absolutely no right to complain.", ">Yesterday evening, I sat down with my dad and told him that I needed some space in the basement. \n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t tho. Objectively and seriously, you don\u2019t need it. You want it, and your parents have been very kind to let you use it. They have clearly raised you to be entitled, as most parents wouldn\u2019t consider paying you for the inconvenience of losing out on your extra space, and you are so entitled that you don\u2019t even take the deal. I hope your dad takes away his offer for money and doesn\u2019t give you the room back even after your sister stops needing it, as you are not appreciative of it.", "YTA. \n\nIt's not your basement. \n\nUnless that is your only actually room where you sleep, you have no argument here. \n\nThe basement is the property of your parents, and if you have a safe, private space- I'm assuming you have your own bedroom- then if they want to make the basement storage for your sister instead of a hang out for your friends, well that's the end of it. \n\nYour Dad was very kind to entertain your complaint and to try and make things better. Your want of hangout space is not a NEED, it is just something you like, and your sister having to leave her apartment and store her stuff is something that any rational person would prioritize, and any parent certainly would. \n\nYou have no right to be annoyed, and while I respect your desire to be \"heard\" you should understand that you were HEARD. Your Dad listened, he empathized, he offered a compromise by offering up some cash. He just didn't agree to what YOU wanted, which was more space in the basement to hang out. You need to learn the difference between being heard and having things your way.", "YTA.  Not your house.  Try to be more like your father as you get older", "YTA and super entitled. Frankly, your dad is also TA for enabling this behavior. \n\nYou better get your head right ASAP or you are in for the shock of a lifetime when you get out into the real world.", "YTA. It's not your house and no one owes you anything. Your sister is in a tough spot and you're focused on hanging with your buddies. Tough.", "yta. it's a fun luxury space, that is now needed for something else. for a house that you do not own. find another hangout spot. life happens sometimes.", "YTA and at age 17 you should be/embarassed/ashamed of yourself. For the short term you and your friends can hang out somewhere else. Your father was right there isn't anything left to discuss. He did not miss anything his toddler son had to say.\n\nDepending when your next birthday is maybe you can move out and see what ir is like.", "He offered to pay rent for his own basement and you refused? \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\n\nLike he doesn't need to do that. The fact is just because you called dibs doesn't mean you're the only one allowed to use it. Grow up. YTA", "YTA and privileged besides. Technically your parents fault for raising you this way but it's not an excuse on your part to not change it. Grow up.", "I\u2019m going to start with a suggestion. Instead of your parents paying you rent to use their own basement, you should ask your parents to help Sarah move everything from the basement into a storage unit. Either that, or have her compress her boxes and get rid of unnecessary furniture.\n\nAs for my verdict\u2026 YTA. But you\u2019re not even 18. Your sense of entitlement is thus far from terminal, and the fact that you\u2019re assessing your actions is a sign to me that you\u2019ll outgrow it in the next couple years. That said, still - YTA for now.\n\nIt\u2019s not your space. You may be accustomed to having it to hang out, but your father is literally offering you money for a space that he already owns. Your father is a saint for being so patient with you. He is trying to offer you a consolation prize for the inconvenience of losing a luxury, and you spat in his face.\n\nI get the desire for space for your friends. Most people do. Your father obviously does more than you think he does. But your sister got her first unpleasant helping of adult life in a very cruel way. Moving back in with parents can be humiliating and comes with it a lot of societal stigma. She might be dealing with that, in addition to the tacit financial difficulties and housing insecurity. Your sister\u2019s needs trump your wants - both in your parents\u2019 eyes, and from a moral point of view.", "YTA. And you don\u2019t deserve \u201crent.\u201d It\u2019s not your house. Go hang at one of your friends\u2019 homes.", "Definitely the asshole...not only is it not even ur house, but u shamed ur dad for trying to alleviate the stress of a temporary loss of space!", "YTA. It\u2019s a temporary situation so just suck it up. Your parents are just trying to help out their daughter and you\u2019re making it about you. Maybe if you paid rent you\u2019d have an argument but you don\u2019t, so no.", "YTA. Just because you didn\u2019t get your way doesn\u2019t mean you were not listened to. Your dad was taking the piss out of you in an attempt to get you to realize how entitled you were being.", "I usually don\u2019t comment whenever the overwhelming majority think someone is TA. But bro, YTA.", "YTA. Don't be surprised when you yourself are in this situation in a few years.", "YTA. By 18, your dad can kick you out or charge you rent. It\u2019s not your house. Get over it.", "YTA.  Who owns the house?", "YTA - the entitlement of this.", "Dude wtf. That is not your space. It is your parents space that they are letting you use. You are being childish. YTA", "YTA look I get that it sucks that you\u2019ve lost your space and it\u2019s frustrating but it\u2019s a bonus room it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve been kicked out of your bedroom. You don\u2019t NEED the space you want it. On the other hand your sister does NEED somewhere to store her things, she can\u2019t afford to just trash everything and buy new. \n\nI\u2019m currently a student struggling with rent shooting up, so speaking from experience this probably isn\u2019t ideal for your sister either. You want independence and freedom as a young adult but finding somewhere affordable to live is a nightmare. It\u2019s kind of scary wondering how your gonna survive when food and housing is so expensive and you can only make so much in a week. I\u2019m insanely grateful to have supportive parents to help me out. I bet your sister is to. Look at this as an example of the treatment you can expect in your early twenties trust me you\u2019ll be grateful for it then. \n\nIf I was you I\u2019d take the money and be very dam happy with it. You aren\u2019t paying rent, it\u2019s not your house and your parents have every right to use their basement. They don\u2019t need to rent it from you, my parents certainly wouldn\u2019t give my sisters money to use a space outside their bedrooms in the house. Your dad isn\u2019t wrong about you needing to be more empathetic. Your sister has nowhere else to go and it\u2019s coming across like you\u2019d happily toss all her stuff in the trash because it inconveniences you.

Hope your parents live a long and healthy life and you never have to rely on your sister for a helping hand because this will absolutely come up.", "But the basement isn\u2019t your room? It\u2019s just a space that you chill with your friends.

How far away is her school? Can the place she's looking for put her at a decent distance to those places so she's not spending over hundreds of dollars in gas just getting there and back every week? How much money does she make? Does she have any pets? What kind of apartment is she looking for? What is her budget? Are the apartments she's looking at capable of meeting her needs? How much room does she need? Will she be paying for the utilities, or will the landlord be paying and have it added to the rent costs? If she found the apartment that meets her needs, how much is the deposit in order to find that place?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of these variables, and more, need to be considered when looking for a place to live. If someone could find a place that fast in a *single month*, then they need to start a business because that is an impressive amount of skill. If you want to get an even better idea of what your sister is going through? Either set yourself, or ask your parents for some fake apartment details that are a REQUIREMENT and not just a want, as well a monthly budget for the rent, deposit, and utilities, and then try searching for an apartment with those parameters. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot to mention, as people have been so keen to tell you in the comments, it's not your basement? It's not even your house. Yes, it is a space that you regularly use, but to complain that other people are using it, especially when it's temporarily, is incredibly selfish.   Imagine going to your favorite fast food place and complain to the workers there that there are other people ordering food here, that it's not fair, and that you should be the only one allowed to order from there because it is YOUR favorite fast food place.

Why should she get rid of anything at all when she is looking at hopefully getting a house she can afford and can move it all back?", "This question makes it very clear how much you take your space at your parents home for granted, and that you haven't struggled with a place to live or lived on your own yet. It makes sense because you are 17, and live with your parents. Youll cringe pretty hard at this in a few years unless youre an entitled A hole then. \n\nHow long do you think it takes to save up money for something, or just to get around to an hours long task, as a struggling adult trying to make it on your own? \n\nAre you working a job to make money that you then use to pay for your: rent, lighting, heating, car insurance, renters insurance probably, possibly a car payment, phone bill, internet if she has it, gas, and food. You then have the time you have to work, the driving time to get there, the time (30m-1.5hrs per meal) to cook the food you buy because no-prep food is more expensive, doing laundry, cleaning yourself and your daily routine, cleaning dishes and any other house hold chores that are done daily or weekly, wiping spills and all those other little things, any time and driving time for any appointments you or your family have that you have to take them to, sleep (way more important than it seems but many of us adults get 4hrs when we should get 6-8 or more at times) and lastly comes time spent with family and friends! I say lastly because this example is working to get back on their feet, and would have to prioritise taking care of work and their home first. \n\nEverything in life takes time and effort, and once you start living on your own you take on a lot of responsibilities. Both large and small, constant and onconsistant. Theres always things that you need to be done, running on a list in your head, and thats just life. When everything on your list is done, or sometimes just what needs to be done this moment, you can relax for a while. Your sister cant relax right now, but at least she knows her parents are keeping her stuff safe. Wouldnt you want them to do the same for you if you were in her situation? Isnt her brother giving her compassion sort of what youd expect from this instead of you making her give up her things so she can never get them back? Things your sister cares about, mean that little to you? If you wanna focus on facts, its your parents home not yours, and any way you act about this can and should shape how they treat you in a similar situation in the future. I hope you learn from this experience and have some sort of understanding talk with your parents and also try to stop taking them for granted at least a little bit. They are supposed to care for you and keep you as healthy as they possibly can while loving and nurturing you, that doesnt mean that you shouldnt feel warm and grateful for it, instead of expectant and as if this world youre living in is yours to take as you please. Its nice of your parents to let you use the basement, they couldve used it for any number of other things. Storage, for one. Gym, laundry room, extra bedroom or air b&b, office, etc. \n\nAnyway, YTA.

It's really really hard. There is a cost of living crisis all over the world right now, and lots of people are struggling. Rental prices are increasing, but wages are not. Where I live, the rental market is ridiculously nsane as landlords are constantly raising their rents to make their own ends meet. I'm nearly 26 and still live at home because I simply cannot afford to move out.\n\nOther landlords are evicting their tenants as they have family - often their own children - who cannot afford their own rent and need somewhere to live. This is basically the same as what your sister has done.\n\nSo unfortunately, the properties are just not there. It might be that your sister has to look for an apartment further away from school so she has to factor travel time. If she has a job, might be she has to consider travel time to that as well, or even look for another job that is closer to a new apartment. You don't know unless you actually sit down with your sister and look at apartments with her. Then you might actually understand.\n\nWhile your sister is living at home, she has every right to store her belongings in the basement. It's not your room, so you have zero claim over it and absolutely zero right to demand she get rid of her stuff.

Genuine question, not here to be snarky. \n\nI\u2019ll tell you how it works in my area, which is likely a whole different country. Consider rent a monthly payment arranged by week so average cost of a one bed apartment in my area is $480 a week, 480x4=$1920 per month to live there. \n\nIf I were lucky enough to be selected for that property amongst the dozens of others applying I then have to pay one months rent in advance plus a bond. \n\nBond is usually 1-1.5 months worth of rent, we\u2019ll say in this example it\u2019s 1.5. So up front I must pay $1920+$2880=$4800. Immediately or I forfeit my contractual obligations to my landlord. I then obviously proceed to pay $1920 every month from then on. Plus electricity each month let\u2019s say that\u2019s $150, gas each quarter which is every three months so we\u2019ll say it\u2019s monthly for the example at $50 a month, my weekly food expenses of$125minimum so 500 a month, and then my phone at $100 a month. \n\nThis isn\u2019t including things like insurance, any loan repayments, costs of study, school supplies, new clothes or uniforms, medical costs, or that once a month treated eat out dinner. The bare necessities of living in a house that\u2019s not your parents in my local area costs approximately $2720 per month. \n\nThat\u2019s a lot of money for someone who is still studying.\n\nImagine having to rebuy everything you own to furnish the place on top of that, that would easily be another $5000.\n\nThere\u2019s a global housing crisis as well, people are finding it harder than ever before to secure a property to rent, especially as a single person. This was never going to be just a couple of weeks.\n\nMy advice to you, would be as much as this situation sucks, it\u2019s always nice to have a space of our own we can hang out with friends. Your sister needs a little bit of extra understanding from you now, you know this is temporary as she needs to get ready for the next schooling semester. Yes it\u2019s taking a little longer than you\u2019d hope, and I hope when you choose to move out one day the rental market isn\u2019t as awful as it is now and you\u2019re able to do so ok.\n\nI think this is a really good opportunity to start gaining some really good financial literacy that will help carry you through the rest of your life.", "It\u2019s not been sorted out for nearly a month!
