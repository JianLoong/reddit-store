We met in middle school and started dating late September this year. My girlfriend's BFF (14F), let's call her Kelly, made a joke a few days ago commenting on one of our friend's aviator glasses saying it made them look like Jefferey Dahmer. (I think you already know where this is going.)\n\nI spoke up, said that we shouldn't make those jokes because they're insensitive to the victims and their families, and that I already see enough people on tiktok \"cosplaying\" him and it's annoying. Kelly replies with \"I'd cosplay him too. Just give me a wig and glasses and I'm good to go.\" I got upset and berated her, but she didn't care.\n\nI then moved away from the group and brought up all my apps I had her added on and blocked her on everything but Snapchat because it was the only way to talk to my GF when I wasn't at school as she didn't have a phone herself. Nonetheless, the topic was broguht up recently when my GF needed me to tell Kelly and her partner that we wouldnt be able to walk with them to the bus ramp as my GF needed to grab something from her chorus class.\n\nI had handed her my phone and she went to text Kelly on Discord but realized Kelly had been blocked. She asked me about it and I told her. My GF asked me if I was going to do that everytime someone made a joke that upset me and push everyone away that easily. I didn't know how to respond so I stuttered. She asked me what would happen if it was her that made the joke, would I break up with her? Push her away?\n\nI got anxious as I really love her and try not to think about anxiety inducing things like that. I told her honestly that she was different, but if she made an insensitive joke like that, I would get annoyed too. She got awkwardly silent and I don't know if I should just unblock Kelly or stand my ground.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1667242311, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yil1sq/aita_for_blocking_my_girlfriends_bff_for_making_a/", "score": 8, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're allowed to feel some type of way about those kinds of comments, but I've got to tell you, you will be hearing \"jokes\" like that for the rest of your life.

The only people here who should be embarrassed for their behaviour are both Kelly, for making light of someone who took the very real lives in a horrific fashion of real human beings, and your girlfriend, for trying to shame you into feeling weird or embarrassed because you actually cared enough to say, \"That bothers me and I'm really not okay with it.\"\n\nContrary to what several commenters have said (and I'm guessing that it's because they allow people your age here on Reddit, and like your friends, they are known more for trying to impress each other than for their consciences or strong sense of self), you reacted exactly the way you should have: by being appalled that someone would not only think it's cool or edgy to talk about a murderer of real people like he was just a fictional character, but be dismissive of you for having feelings about it, and try to act like you were \"overreacting\". \n\nNope. The appropriate response to your girlfriend was: \"Yes, if you made a joke about someone who harmed people, I would also probably not want to be around you, because that's not okay.\" \n\nYou're a decent human being. That's not something to be embarrassed of. But whatever their nonsense is, it isn't cute or funny. You're NTA."]}
