Our friends were very excited and happy that we got together except our friend Rachel (who is 25).  At the party Rachel acted really sour toward me.  I noticed she didn't act the same toward my boyfriend.  She would try to hover around him and make physical contact while pretending I didn't exist. \n\nA couple friends noticed this and asked me if we were fighting or what happened.  I didn't know what was happening until later Rachel asked if we could talk privately.  The reason she was acting sour was because Rachel had a crush on him 6 years ago.  I recall this but I didn't think it was serious back then because Rachel crushes on a new guy every year and already had a crush on every guy in our group at one point. \n\nRachel insisted she doesn't have a crush on my boyfriend anymore and is now crushing on another guy but she's still pissed off that I started dating him without consulting her first.  She suggested that I reconsider dating him because I breached her trust and backstabbed her and this would make up for things.\n\nI was taken back by what she asked me and told her I wouldn't reconsider dating him for her. \n\nRachel asked me if I even feel sorry for her because the man she crushed on never reciprocated her feelings and only had eyes for someone else.  She pointed out how sad it is that she knew she never had a chance in the first place because he fell for another person even though she met him first. \n\nI thought Rachel's request was ridiculous so I told her that I didn't feel sorry and that is life.  If she never tried to ask him out it wasn't my fault. This pissed off Rachel even more.\n\nNow I'm wondering if I was too harsh by saying that I didn't feel sorry for her and not considering her feelings.

With the number of crushes you say she had and the fact that her crush on your current bf is so long ago, it should be irrelevant.\n\nShe's just jealous because you seem happy with your relationship status and she's unhappy with hers.  A very small amount of sympathy for her overall situation might be in order, but not for any type of rights or first dibs on your current bf.  That part is just ridiculous and she needs to grow up.", "NTA. You can date whomever you want. How your friend might feel about it is totally irrelevant.

No you\u2019re nta but she kinda is. I get she\u2019s hurt because he chose you or whatever, but you\u2019re both together now. If she\u2019s a real friend she\u2019ll say it sucks but move on but if she\u2019s the type of friend I get the feeling she is, then she\u2019s probably going to try and snatch him (all the touching and ignoring you). I\u2019d let her go personally. Good luck", "This is ridiculous. Since when did you need her permission to start dating someone you love who loves you back?

Your friend is hung up on the fact she had a crush on this guy *six years* ago. I guess I can see if your tone was harsh it might not have helped the conversation be productive, but ultimately, this is really mostly your friend's problem. \n\nDo you like this friend? If not, perhaps a slow fade is best. If you do want to keep this friendship, I might text her something like \"Hey Rachel, I don't like how our conversation went last night, if I came off as uncaring it's because I was actually pretty shocked you were upset - I honestly didn't even remember you used to have a crush on my boyfriend so many years ago. Hopefully it goes without saying that I want you to be happy, but at the same time I stand by my position that I don't need to ask you for permission, given how long ago your feelings for him were.\" Or something along those lines - i.e. you can show you have empathy for her (she mainly just sounds really lonely) all while not giving an inch to her unreasonable demand.", "NTA This sounds like drama 10 year old would do in a playground", "Ok, so I'm petty as hell, so maybe don't follow my example.
