I giggled a fair bit at Rachel 's strange, strange \"logic\". Its hilarious. It sounds like she wanted him as a fall back guy, or thinks she has some sort of claim on any guy she has associated with. Last time I came across something like this I was 15.", "NTA NTA NTA\n\nIs your friend fucking 8??? I saw him first he's mine you need my permission!? Wtf.... you did right telling her it isn't your problem. Girl needs a reality check. Someone like that wouldn't be in my friend group.... entitled possessive and dillusional.... super bad combination.", "NTA.  Rachel must always pissed since there are dozens of women dating her former crushes without her permission.", "I seriously had to scroll back up to double check if y\u2019all were adults or middle schoolers bc that\u2019s like peak teen behavior.

Bad combo - be wary.", "Tell your partner. Given how self centered this woman is, I wouldnt put it past her to try some sneaky shi with your man especially if y\u2019all share friends. \n\nIt\u2019s up to him to draw boundaries as needed and REINFORCE, if he even slightly plays the \u2018oh but I don\u2019t want to cause issues\u2019 card, drop his ass. \n\nNo man will put himself in a situation that can harm his relationship.
