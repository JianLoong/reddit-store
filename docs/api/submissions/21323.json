Charlotte usually sides with her so there's no problem normally. This time, I said no, I've heard and seen people take this and it helps them. She said that still doesn't mean there's scientific evidence behind it. She said it could also damage mom's liver if taken too much.\n\nI told her to please not give any unsolicited advice, and let the rest of us live life the way we want to.
