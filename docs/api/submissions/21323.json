Don\u2019t believe everything Reddit and Facebook spew to you.", "Especially on this sub, sad that this person even has upvotes, OP said absolutely nothing negative about them being women or lesbians, just stated the basics like everyone else so we understand the story easier. Perpetual victims on Reddit just bringing absolute cringe.", "Trouble with supplements is that there is not a huge range of peer-reviewed studies on them.", "Well said!", "OP says they're a nurse. I'm also a nurse and yup it's infuriating, some of us like evidence based research, some apparently like to risk their parents livers based on something they found online, gives us all a bad name!", "OP is a CNA per one of their comments, so not even actually a nurse", "RN or LPN? Huge difference in training/education.", "Florida's had a real problem with that lately.... maybe OP is in Florida.", "You were treated as Heros.  Hero is what they call you when they expect you to die for your work.", "You don\u2019t even need to be a Doctor to know these supplements are BS. It\u2019s concerning you\u2019re a nurse. Thank goodness you can\u2019t prescribe medications and make decisions on patient treatments and care. You need to be babysat. I\u2019ve met nurses like you and it\u2019s exhausting and stressful to be around people like you when you\u2019re sick and in pain.", "Immediately on Hannah's side.\n\nDoes she actually have a sense of superiority? It seems like this is firmly in her lane as a doctor, and is raising valid concerns about this supplement.\n\nYour recollection of a few anecdotal experiences of other people liking it doesn't trump where scientific evidence points to it being a placebo, or make it safe when there's evidence of it being capable of causing negative side effects. \n\nYour mum should find something else to take. At least a placebo without known negative side-effects.", "No no no that means it's all lies!!", "RN with 2 year degree", "Same with Dementia wards. Utter madness.", "Wow. Medical school and all.

So their might be additional things they can help your mom with.", "Being that homeopatic medicine is not actually medicine their production process is VERY lax and lacks security and health checks.

I\u2019ll stick with natural things I have seen work for myself. Water can kill you if you drink to much at a time.

A CNA is nowhere near being a nurse.", "A CNA\u2019s work is vital part of the health care system but you aren\u2019t a nurse, you are a nursing assistant.

You should definitely be listening to your SIL, who clearly cares about your mother more than you do.", "omg. so basically you have no scientific or pharmacology education to back up your thinking. at least ask her PCP first please, before you irreversibly destroy your mother\u2019s health. \n\n\nalso, stop calling yourself a nurse. you aren\u2019t a nurse, you\u2019re a CNA.", "Wait, like a nurse's aid?

She doesn't need to embrace her feelings and needs meds.", "Supplements are not subject to regulation by the FDA or any US government agency.  Drugs are...supplements and vitamins are not considered drugs and therefore are not regulated.

Their field of expertise is drugs & drug interactions. Doctors consult with them about drugs.", "I think there's a lot of times when nurses have a more accurate grasp on a situation than a doctor because they spend a lot more time with a patient.  I had a doctor clear me for going home because of my blood work.  The nurses knew I still had trouble sitting up by myself, that at home it was 30 feet between my bed and the bathroom, and that I was sometimes lightheaded.  I also lived alone, and the friend that was supposed to stay with me had gotten a covid exposure, so it wasn't safe for him to stay with me. \n\nSo a lot of times nurses do have better judgement than doctors because they know more about an individual patient.", "He's not an RN.

That's scary to think about.", "Oh he definitely lied so that people wouldn't question his credentials. I can't believe he actually admitted he's a CNA.", "That has nothing to do with medical knowledge. What a lot of nurses tend to believe is just because they can write a few medications they are equal. \n\nThe most difficult part is the diagnosis, which the DOCTOR does , treating the patient when you know whats wrong with them is super easy.", "Unregulated supplements are safer and undergo \u2018less strict testing\u2019 the same way that imploded Titan sub did\u2026 think on that.", "Soooo, he\u2019s absolutely not a nurse.  I love the techs and aides that assist me, but unfortunately there\u2019s not a science involved.  \n\nCNAs do back breaking work.  And I respect them.

No clue what it can be", "Absolutely CNAs do very valuable work. My mom is a retired ICU RN and she very much appreciated the assistance from the CNAs in her unit, but no, it's absolutely not the same as being an RN or a nurse practitioner.

Many of them, like essential fatty acids, have dozens of peer reviewed studies for dozens of applications, including inflammatory response. Many herbal and mycological remedies have been studied for decades.\n\nMany of the novel ones hitting the market have a lot of anecdotal and historical uses, but either don't have that many studies on them yet because they're so new, or because it isn't cost effective to study them, or because the ability to patent a natural compound is difficult, which is why you'll see proprietary blends of two or more components which is what this particular supplement does.", "Yep.", "I haven't worked in pharmacy for many years but is glucosamine and chondroitin plus fish oil not the norm as a supplement anymore?", "Thank you for mentioning that, I hadn't seen that comment.\n\nYeah, OP is middle-aged, a CNA, and a man.

Her daughter, my brother's wife. Who has studied medicine, and worked as a medical assistant to some degree (honestly the different levels of medical knowledge/degrees/\"permissions\" for lack of better words really confuse me; she could do a lot of stuff in a doctor's office, but she wasn't an actual nurse). I've worked as a medical lab tech, so I know a different side of medicine, but try to keep up with some things.\n\nAnyway she recently got into a... Faith that strongly believes in a lot more spirituality than I do, even with my own faith (which has had it's own struggles due to that but that's a whole different story). Anyway, due to this new path of hers, she told her mom that she'd be able to find a supplement somewhere that could help heal her mom's cancer cells so she wouldn't have to do chemo or anything like that....\n\nI'm pretty sure she even used the word \"cure\". It's been awhile, so I can't remember a hundred percent but that's pretty much when I was like \"I will no longer be taking medical advice from this woman.\"\n\nI have nothing against her faith as it's her spirituality and that's her thing.
