She was born from a one night stand with a now former friend(37M). We never got together and he refused to be involved in my pregnancy or my daughter's first 4 years of life. I was stressed out emotionally because its a big change, but I never asked for child support or force him to be involved. I have enough income to send my daughter to private school. I'm perfectly fine on my own.\n\nThe issue started when he reappeared from wherever he went and decided he wanted visitation. He's not in my daughter's birth certificate. Father is listed as 'unknown'. He wanted to have that amended. I said no, and that if he wants, best he'll get is to meet her in outings with myself or my daughter's godparents. He agreed, but he's been constantly pressuring getting parental rights. Court already gave him a big fat no, unless he pays 4 years of child support which with his income goes somewhere around 230k USD. He hasn't paid a cent.\n\nMy daughter doesn't even call him dad. Or recognize him as dad. She calls him 'mister'. I keep it very clean. I never bad talked him, never made up stories. When she asked about her father I used to say it was just the two of us. Even during court the assigned CPS agent testified that my daughter had no affection or clear relationship with her biological father.\n\nNow the main issue happen in a PTA meeting. He would say things like 'my family thinks' or 'what is best for my family'. I didn't agree with him and I voiced by saying 'my daughter' has different needs and those are priority. He was clearly angry.\n\nAfter the meeting there was a moment for teachers and parents to mingle and just talk how the kids are doing. One of the teachers approach me to apologize, saying she didn't know 'my husband and I' didn't like a project she was doing with the kids. I told her I had no husband and my daughter loved the project and wants to be part of it. The teacher then told me that my former friend was going around talking like he's my husband and he 'represents the family'.\n\nI saw red. I walked to him and very loudly told him we needed to talk in private. In the parking lot I told him we were not a family and that he either will respect I am the only one that can make decisions on my daughter's education or he won't be involved. He went on about being her biological father, then I reminded him he had not paid a cent for the pregnancy, my daughter's needs, or even the private school my daughter is in.\n\nHe hasn't tried to see my daughter since, which she doesn't mind at all. I asked her. I do feel a bit bad about what I said. AITA?\n\nI wanted to add this because the PMs are driving me insane: He has the money to pay child support. He chose -not- to pay. He was NEVER prohibited from being involved. He had my phone number. I sent him picture and invited him to birthdays and other big celebrations. He never came.\n\nPSA: We are not in the US.", "created_utc": 1703343943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18p7iv7/aita_for_telling_my_daughters_father_we_are_not_a/", "score": 2500, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For a restraining order, and to force him to pay. They can (and will if forced) garnish payment from his paycheck. I don't know what he wants out of this, but the fact that he continues to be a deadbeat child is concerning and frustrating. I wonder if a dying distant relative has asked him to produce an heir.

That is not a parent.", "Honestly, I would suggest that you do not include him in PTA matters since he is not legally her guardian, and he shouldn't have been involved in the first place.  He has never paid child support yet has the finances to do so and had no desire to be a dad ever until he showed up out of the blue one day.

He's already tried to just show up in her life as if he's always been there, now you're putting him in his place and it seems his ego is what is driving him with this. Hence, why he hasn't paid any of the back child support, but is still trying to go around and act like he has any authority whatsoever in regards to your daughter.\n\nRather than just risk assuming he has disappeared again, double or even triple check you have everything in place so he doesn't just show up and try to take her. Especially, from your comments, you said where you're from, being a single mother isn't the normal and from the sounds of it, looked down at, even slightly.

In some ways you're letting him play the part of Dad while also telling him he's not the dad. If your daughter doesn't want to see him then you need to cut him out of your life completely. Plus him showing up at her school and you not making it clear he has no rights can lead to issues if he shows up when you're not there. This is how kids get kidnapped.", "100% NTA.

After that when he proves he's not a deadbeat he can go back to court and get some form of custody. \n\nHe doesn't get to go to PTA meetings until he pays half of her school fees. \n\nWhilst it is nice you want to try and give yout daughter a relationship with her father he needs to earn it. He doesn't get to waltz in and demand to be head of a family he has not actively played a part in beyond providing the sperm.\n\nI'd contact the school and say direction in schooling comes from you only.", "ESH. He\u2019s an AH for bailing on your daughter, not trying to pay back child support, not getting tested to prove he is her father so he could be involved, and definitely for his behavior at the PTA meeting. \n\nYou\u2019re an AH for prioritizing money over your daughter. As you\u2019ve said, you\u2019re financially able to care for her, so using back child support seems more like a weapon. I get that she\u2019s fine without him and doesn\u2019t have a close bonded relationship with him, but she naturally wouldn\u2019t considering the contact she\u2019s had with him. No court would just give him visitation. He would have to go through several steps to be able to be a father to her. If he did so, and proved he could be a good father, why would you want to deprive her of the opportunity to have two loving supportive parents. Make him work for it, not just pay for it.", ">I never bad talked him, never made up stories\n\nYou didn't maliciously lie against him? That makes everything fine? Talk about setting yourself a low bar.\n\nThis reads like a load of ESH. Who it's weighted towards varies depending on the time we're focused on. He should never have been an absent father. He should have been there for his daughter for those four years. He has realized this. Bearing the child of a one-night stand creates exactly this kind of situation. \n\nSome of your anger seems to be about not getting child support. In reality, you chose not to seek it. In fact, you seem to be so well off that being a single mother didn't even stop you from sending your kid to **PRIVATE** school (!!!). \n\nDespite that, you're taking advantage of the court's ruling that he has to fork over 230k to block any attempt to forge a parental bond with his daughter, starting at the age of four. So for 2 years. You do not give the slightest indication that you need child support now, either. It's entirely about revenge for you, against him for not being there at first. You want to stop him from having a relationship with his daughter. And he does not seem to be reacting well. But then who would, when one does not have 230k lying around, and the 230k isn't needed *except* as a means of keeping one away?\n\n>I was stressed out emotionally because its a big change, but I never asked for child support or force him to be involved. I have enough income to send my daughter to private school. I'm perfectly fine on my own.\n\nSee, it really doesn't sound like money is much of an object for you. So very many people would be just about destitute in that situation. Yet you apparently had no problem at all, not even needing child support (you can't claim to have needed it if you didn't bother seeking it). And that matters in a moral sense. The only reason there is a 230k to talk about is because he tried to get some parental rights, and apparently 230k isn't as easily within his reach as the judge thinks. And from what you say, you don't need the 230k, apparently, or even seem to *want* it. Its function is just to block a father-daughter relationship.\n\nFrankly, it sounds like a lot is missing and you two just plain hate each other. None of this is about your daughter's best interests. It's about revenge on the father that relies on access to the daughter. I wonder what your daughter will think of this when she becomes an adult and cannot be kept away from him by parental order. She's likely to be less focused on your revenge than you are.\n\n(Or, hey, maybe he finds a way to scrape together 230k, buys his parental rights, eventually forms a loving father-daughter bond, and then daughter finds out the *real* reason he was away from the time she was 4 until whenever he finds the 230k).", "NTA.\n\nHe sounds like an asshole, or at the very least, a very confused person.\n\nIf you can, try not to antagonize him though - it is possible that in the future your daughter will want to connect with her biological parent.", "Oh. Got it. He has an obligation to pay money to see his child. I wonder if you would feel a similar responsibility if you had been absent for any reason and wanted visitation. Well, time generally rights the ship, and children find that which has been withheld from them. Best of luck OP.", "NTA.\n\nActually this need a new acronym: YAW (You're awesome)", "If hes not willing to pay up for the missing years he can't expect to be welcomed back into his daughters life just like that. NTA", "NTA. Sounds like \"Mister\" wants the promotion to \"Dad\" but without putting in any of the hard work that goes along with that title, even if it nothing more than paying up the owed child support. Don't beat yourself over telling him off and put the PMs on mute or block.", "NTA\n\nDoesn't need an explanation. You provided that yourself", "NTA. Talk to a lawyer and get a restraining order limited to school and after school activities.", "There should be room for a man to own up to his mistakes and be given a chance to be a father to a daughter, if only for the daughter's sake, but this man is not it.\n\nI'd be inclined to get a restraining order against him if he can't be stopped from falsely claiming parental status with the school", "NTA", "NTA \n\nCut off this douchewaffle. He\u2019s lying and being a bully.", "NTA  Make sure you name him on the 'not allowed to pick up' list for anyplace daughter goes such as school, daycare or anywhere she goes without you.", "He actually forced himself into the meeting. I wanted to give it a chance for him to be involved. I didn't expect him to act this way though.", ">Why is he in a PTA meeting with you?\n\nThis. OP, did you consider getting the restriction order from the court?", "She needs to be very clear with the school that he has no rights and must not be allowed to enter the school or pick her up. This is how parental abductions happen.", "[removed]", "Was wondering the same! If he's not on the birth certificate and has no legal standing as a parent, he shouldn't be at the school or going to PTA meetings. Let the school know that he is not welcome, and has no right to be there. I can't imagine they just let random people attend events?", "I've been trying to let him be involved. If he wants a relationship with my daughter, I'm okay with it. He has no legal rights, but I have no problem of him being part of her life. He just doesn't get to make decisions on things he's not paying for. Like school.", "You can't \"rebuild\" something that never existed.", "This is the vibe I get, too. Either he's a narcissistic creeper stalker who thinks he's entitled to unfettered access to the child and decisions regarding her purely because of the biologicalconnection, or based on OP's comment about the sperm donor being from \"old money,\" his wealthy family may have plans to get their hooks into \"their\" grandchild because they feel entitled to her.", "I made sure to speak to admin. Kids cannot be removed from school without signed permission from the legal guardian. Otherwise, kids take a bus straight from the school home. And I work from home, so I always receive her at the front.", "Oh my god this made me laugh more than it should. My girl calls her godfather 'Papa' and tells everyone he's a cowboy and talks a bit too much about ranch life. Gory details included.", "He said he wanted to be involved and see the school.", "This is not in the US, if you are trying to compare with the US like most people in my PMs. We are in Central America. We have different laws here and our CPS is always involved in cases of parental rights to avoid intimidation or manipulation by a parent.", "Oh stfu he wanna just now come back after years and didn\u2019t want nothing to do with her now all of sudden he can make decisions please just stfu", "I wondered why he was at the PTA meeting as well. How did he even know about it?", "Idk how it is in other countries, but here visitations are not guaranteed unless the father has parental rights. I am not denying him access, I just don't feel comfortable of him being alone with my daughter.\n\nChild support is mandatory for parental rights. He has never paid a dime, so the court deny him parental rights.", "If he's not willing to demonstrate significant commitment, why let him work for a relationship? OP says he's old money who could very easily pay it. Letting him have access is letting him skip the steps to prove he's actually worth working with.", "\"You\u2019re an AH for prioritizing money over your daughter.\"\n\nNope, the court decided that. As another commenter has put it, if he wants the rights of being a parent, he needs to demonstrate his acceptance of the responsibilities.", "It\u2019s clear from the post that the \u201creal reason\u201d he was absent from the first four years of her life, as you put it, is because he didn\u2019t want to be involved. OP didn\u2019t stop him from reaching out for the first four years, she didn\u2019t demand or ask for money, the dude just didn\u2019t want to be there. Now he\u2019s changed his mind. You can argue that child support shouldn\u2019t be part of parental rights if you want,  but don\u2019t change history and turn this guy into someone who wanted contact for the first four years.", ">The only reason there is a 230k to talk about is because he tried to get some parental rights, and apparently 230k isn't as easily within his reach as the judge thinks.\n\nThere are no rights without responsibilities. He avoided his parental responsibilities for the first 4 years, and this cannot be reverted already. The judge considered the case and decided that these 230K will be the best possible substitution of the skipped responsibilities. Why do you think that you know better?\n\nOP, NTA obviously. Especially taking into consideration your comment about an abortion.", "He actually asked me to abort, so there's your context if it helps. Also, to correct one thing:  I never kept him away. I called him to the birth, I called him for every birthday. I tried to have him involved but he always said he didn't want to be part of it. Two years ago he came up and began asking for rights. I never stopped him, but I don't feel comfortable with him being alone with my daughter.", "Your view of the child support is entirely wrong. Child support does not depend on whether the mother needs it or not. Child support is money for the child. The child has an unailenable right to that money.", ">Despite that, you're taking advantage of the court's ruling that he has to fork over 230k to block any attempt to forge a parental bond with his daughter, starting at the age of four. So for 2 years. You do not give the slightest indication that you need child support now, either. It's entirely about revenge for you, against him for not being there at first.\n\nAm I on a men's rights sub? The 230k is about doing the legal minimum to show his commitment to his daughter, not about revenge. According to OP, he hasn't even tried to pay down that debt. \n\nIt isn't about revenge, it is about protecting OP's daughter from basically a stranger and making sure they are serious about the lifelong commitment that comes with being a parental figure.", "He's got to demonstrate some kind of commitment before OP risk's her kid's heart on it. Right now the kid has no relationship with the ex and so there's no problem for her if he doesn't show up. If she gets attached and he ditches again, the kid's going to be a little fucked up about it.\n\nIt is in the child's best interests to keep her away from a known flake until he proves he can act maturely.", "And how exactly did he know time/place?", "When you say he can pay, is it like he's wealthy enough that he could pay it all in one go and not worry about it? Or that he makes enough money to eventually pay the back child support? \n\nEither way, you're nta. I think it'd still be nta even if he wasn't doing this alpha big man of the family stuff. Either way I think if you think keeping him entirely out of your daughter's life would benefit her more than having him there. She's still pretty young and although he's a huge asshole, but it's a bit different than if he just decided to come back when she turned 18 and tried to be the fun dad or whatever. I think at the end of the day you know what's best for your kid. I think whether we like It or not, not having a father figure in your life can affect you just as  not having a mother can as well. Even in same sex couples, I would still say usually there's a parent that takes a more nurturing role. \n\nIt's great what you've done for your kid as a parent, and I think you should always advocate for what's best for your kid. If you think he's the type to flake again, maybe she doesn't need that. It's all a very difficult situation, but even though I said what I said before, I think growing up without a father is better than growing up with a flaky or abusive father, as many can say from their own experience.", "You need to set up a meeting with the principal and your daughter's teacher and explain that he is not a legal parent.  Bring the court documentation if you have it.  \n\nThey need to know who he is and what their rights are.  Don't be surprised if they ask him to leave next time.\n\nDon't be so embarrassed by him that you stay silent.  Schools deal with AHs like him all the time.  Help them to be prepared.", "Well that was stupid of you. You can't afford to be this spineless.\n\nHe's going to use this shit in court, the judge is going to fucking love hearing how he's going to PTA meetings.\n\nOr maybe he'll just skip that and kidnap your daughter by taking her out of school early, I mean the teachers \"know\" he's her dad now and he can just take her.", "You say you keep it clean but you're not keeping it clean.  He's either in her life as her father or he's not, this thing you've been doing where he's in your daughter's life but not is BS and will likely mess your daughter up the older she gets.  It seems to me that for the foreseeable future, he shouldn't be in your daughter's life at least not until she asks for him in a significant way.  NTA", "I didn't want to get one. Like I said, I was okay with him interacting with her if her godparents or myself were present.", "There's some public events and technically open forums people can attend. This one is a bit in the middle. I sometimes bring my cousin and his wife, who are my daughter's godparents and would be her guardians should anything happen to me.", "Listen, he petitioned the court for a resolution and they gave him one - to gain authority, he must show responsibility. By allowing him to bypass that decision and thwart that process, you have invited harassment and inappropriate contact with your daughter's circle. Your sentimentality just bit you in the ass. What happens if he calls her doctor? Her classmates' parents? You need to insist that he obey the court order if he wants to participate in her life. It's not just for convenience or propriety, it's for safety and security.", "better question because he owes four years of child support if no court has ever forced him to pay, in fact he is not even legally the father so it is literally impossible for him to have to post ridiculously false stories", "You need to let him walk before he runs! He's showing you he's clearly not on your side or your daughters. He's trying to be \"the man of the house.\" You need him to take smaller steps before you allow him to inject himself. He can make decisions for your daughter when he's caught up financially or has been around consistently enough to know he's not just here for a dopamine fix.", "Very good point! I edited my post.", "Well done! If I were in your shoes I'd be really freaked out about him giving other people the impression he's got a say.", "Respectfully, I think the situation is your fault for letting him be there. You say he\u2019s not her father, don\u2019t need him or want him to be\u2014 but let him play dad at her school. There\u2019s a big difference between \u201coutings\u201d and a school pta meeting. It seems like it\u2019s a good thing he hasn\u2019t seen her since. Maybe you need to pick a side, as she gets older this could get way harder and more confusing for your daughter", "Right now his place is more like \"fun uncle\" \n\nHe is not a parent, and he is not the one making decisions for your daughter, stop allowing that \n\nSchool, medical decisions, and that kind of stuff are not his place \n\nGoing to the movies, ice cream, go to the park, that's his place", "That is so dangerous.

I just think if both parents are financially stable, it\u2019s less important to focus on the money than on the child. I would rather he work on the interpersonal relationship to show the child and her mother that he is committed than on the money. Her description seemed more in line with controlling the situation than protecting the child to me, especially since she described him as a friend before the pregnancy. She didn\u2019t mention any concerns she had about him when they were friends that would indicate he would be a danger to the child and even said she tried to get him involved. I feel like her resentment that he hasn\u2019t been involved is driving this, at the expense of the child. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think he\u2019s at fault for his behavior, but at least he\u2019s trying now when she\u2019s 6 instead of 16, and he stuck it out for 2 years with what seems like limited encouragement or positive outcomes. It\u2019s possible he doesn\u2019t see the point in paying back child support because it won\u2019t get him anywhere.

I get she invited him to parties and stuff and he didn\u2019t show. He was a total AH, or an idiot at the least.
