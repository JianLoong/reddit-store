It's a lovely neighborhood, and I generally have a great relationship with my neighbors. However, there's one neighbor, Dave (45M), who has been causing some issues lately, and I need some perspective on whether or not I am the asshole here.\n\nDave and his family moved into the house next door about a year ago.

This hasn't been a problem until recently when Dave started hosting large gatherings at his house.\n\nDuring these gatherings, Dave's guests would park their cars on the street, which would quickly become overcrowded. As a result, some of his guests started using my driveway without asking for permission. Initially, I let it slide because I didn't want to cause any conflict. However, it began happening more frequently, and on a few occasions I'd be unable to move my own car when I had to go to work or leave for my own business forcing me to go to Dave's house and play a guessing game for someone to move their car.\n\nI decided to address the issue with Dave, explaining that I didn't mind his guests occasionally using my driveway, but I would appreciate it if he could ask for permission first. Dave seemed understanding and apologized for the inconvenience.\n\nHowever, the situation didn't improve. Dave continued to host gatherings, and his guests continued to use my driveway without permission.

Dave confronted me, saying I was being unreasonable and that I should be more accommodating to his guests. He argued that it was just for a few hours and that I was creating unnecessary tension in the neighborhood.\n\nI stood my ground, explaining that I had tried to address the issue politely, and that my driveway is my private property. I added that he should have respected my request for permission and made better arrangements for his guests' parking.\n\nEver since then me and Dave have not spoke to each other with him and his family most of the time shooting me a bad look.\n\nSo, AITA for not allowing my neighbor to use my driveway for his guests, despite having tried to address the issue politely?", "created_utc": 1683468934, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ap1rs/aita_for_not_allowing_my_neighbor_to_use_my/", "score": 900, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is easy to be respectful, and only once did someone attending my party throw a fit about it, and everyone kind of laughed and brushed it off, because while we are loud and having a good time on a Friday night, we can still try to be as accommodating as possible. Never once has someone come over with a parking issue, and it's been over a year now.\n\nSo knowing this, Dave is the asshole. You tried to resolve it peacefully.
