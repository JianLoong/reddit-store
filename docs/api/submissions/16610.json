It's a lovely neighborhood, and I generally have a great relationship with my neighbors. However, there's one neighbor, Dave (45M), who has been causing some issues lately, and I need some perspective on whether or not I am the asshole here.\n\nDave and his family moved into the house next door about a year ago.

Dave confronted me, saying I was being unreasonable and that I should be more accommodating to his guests. He argued that it was just for a few hours and that I was creating unnecessary tension in the neighborhood.\n\nI stood my ground, explaining that I had tried to address the issue politely, and that my driveway is my private property.

Don't let it slide. It took me a while to learn this but you have to speak up immediately and say \"nope\". \n\n#1 - This can be hard because a lot of us (women) don't speak until we are at the end of our tether and so we think speaking up at all will be like that - that loud, that 'emotional', that hard on US. But if you can learn to speak up first in a very flat, this is just the facts, kind of way, you'll do yourself a favor. \n\nHonestly, there was this commercial on american tv (cannot find) that is about car sales and it's a salesman and a customer in a dealership. The salesman is telling the customer (who is standing very very close to the saleman) a list of things that are great about the car. When he finishes, the customer asks, 'Is there anything else you can tell me?' and the salesman replies, very matter of factly, \"Yes, you are standing way too close to me, dude. Personal space. Personal space.\" Cue customer looking sheepish and backing up and laugh track. But no joke, literally two days later, this co-worker of mine who also did that (stood way too close) was doing that to me and I thought, give it a try, and I said to her, \"FriendName, you are standing way to close to me for comfort. Personal space, girl, personal space.\" And she also looked startled and then looked at the space between us and jumped back and then apologized for doing it. She said it was a bad habit, she knew and she failed to realize she was doing it and asked me to just remind her again.\n\nAnd I was reinforced that often, saying the thing calmly the first time really does work. Then you don't come out of absolutely nowhere with anger (which I've done).\n\n#2 - Watch how men interact around you. Watch how often a guy will say calmly to another guy, \"don't do that\" or \"Not cool, man\" and how they accept it and move on. Channel that energy (if you can - it took practice on my part). Again, dudes often ignore women when we \"complain\" because we wait until we're upset about something and we 'let it slide' initially.\n\n#3 - No one else is a mind reader. We can have the whole conversation in our head about how we'll be okay this time and they'll just KNOW it was an overstep or a special one-time event, and the other person (usually a guy but not always) will be NOT THINKING about the interaction in any way at all other than maybe 'Cool, parking there is fine' - cuz how would the neighbor know it bothers you? Oh, he should 'just know'? Yeah, that doesn't work. Use your words (going forward).\n\n#4 - Not sure how to come back from this other than just be clear \"I was fine until you took advantage, now you get nothing. Any other cars not mine park in my driveway, I'll have them towed. End of discussion.\" Post a sign about towing, find a towing company and have them on speed dial. \n\nAnd 45M Dave is used to intimidating the women around him and telling you that living your life for YOUR convenience is inconveniencing him and expecting the women to cave.

When will that naughty little rascal learn, smh.", "The fact that the guests respect the sign makes me think that Dave told them they could park there. Once the sign went up, his friends knew that he didn\u2019t ask and that he\u2019s an asshole. That\u2019s why he and his family are mad.", "People wouldn\u2019t be sticking around for long if that was the case, it would be a semi constant stream of people in and out, not a party.", "I would never park in a stranger\u2019s driveway! That\u2019s so odd. You\u2019re absolutely right that the guests must have been told that they could do so, because I don\u2019t see why anyone would do it otherwise", "Good point.", "Fuck Dave", "NTA and your neighbor has boundary issues. Your property is your property. But I would say fine your guest can park there for a fee \ud83d\ude02 because that's just rude. Difficult because neighbors can go from good to bad quickly.

Neighbour should have respected that. NTA.", "In the US?  Don't give in.

Blocking people's driveways is dangerous, because what if it's an emergency? Besides, it's just plain rude, as it's already inconvenienced you on a number of occasions.

That's certainly not neighborly of dear ol' Dave.\n\nPersonally, I'd start towing. Tell Dave you're not going to ask people to move their cars anymore. If they block your driveway, you're calling a tow company.", "I live on a cul de sac in a very nice neighborhood. Most of us don\u2019t have extra cars in the driveways. Just the 2 or 3 in the garage. Parking is usually not an issue\u2026unless you\u2019re in the middle of the culde sac, like me. We are only 14 houses; ALL of us with the exception of 2 houses (1 of them my next door neighbors..and the subject of my post) are original owners and have been here 25+ years. We know each other. \n\nMy next door neighbors move in and right away it\u2019s like the Clampetts. On weekends and holidays it\u2019s like party central. Loud, ridiculous pool parties that start at 7 am and go all night. Parking; the entire neighborhood is blocked in. My driveway\u2026forget it. There would have to be 4-5 people move their cars for me & everyone else to get in & out of their driveways. \n\nWe finally had to call code enforcement every single time there was a violation on noise & parking (don\u2019t get me started about the nude sunbathing and no fence) and get the County to ticket & tow these people. Fortunately, the neighbors got a clue and they quit with the loud ass parties. OP, have you investigated calling code enforcement in the future? \n\nNo, NTA.", "Omg you are not the asshole!! You did everything right! Your neighbor is an asshole! If they wanted more space they shouldn't have bought that house or moves there! That is your property! You could try putting cones up at the end of your driveway to stop them.. otherwise just call the cops if that doesn't work once they park there. I mean u warned them multiple times.", "NTA", "You're too nice. I would have just opened with \"don't ever park in my driveway. \" NTA", "Dave\u2019s TA", "Surely you didn't need to type all that out just to find out you are clearly NTA?  Is it okay for his guests to use your living room, patio, bedroom, read your diary?  NO!", "NTA!", "Absolutely NTA. How rude for them to assume they can park there with out asking. Thats common sense! You needed to leave and had to go find someone to ask them move their car off of your property? You were forced to put the sign up. All they had to do was ask you first (even this would have been I sued but you hand the option). Dave is a rude neighbor.", "NTA. If something happens to anything or anyone on your property it\u2019s your responsibility. For example if someone who is parked in your driveway falls while going to or leaving their car and they get hurt then you could have a problem with your insurance. It\u2019s not about your inconsiderate neighbor it\u2019s having strangers on your property! I went through this at a vacation home, the neighbors knew that I wasn\u2019t there all the time so they parked in my driveway and I had to tell them that my insurance didn\u2019t cover anyone else\u2019s car on my property. He should have thought about how much room he needed before he bought the house. Not your problem!", "NTA. I had a neighbor who had very late parties. She woke up my kid and their neighbor's kid. With my kid being an infant and me already getting minimal sleep and it being 3am my ex went to her house. \n\nHe knocked. The person who answered the door asked what he wanted. He said, \"it's 3am, please keep the noise down.\". He told my ex to FO.  My ex said, \"cool, calling the cops\".\n\nMeanwhile, I was trying to get the baby back to sleep when the neighbor came pounding on the door waking the baby and begging for us not to call the cops. \n\nToo bad. \n\nIf your neighbor asks you politely to do something with regard to not being a neighborhood jerk, do it", "It's your property. Suppose some stranger gets hurt while on your property or your car gets damaged; who do you suppose will foot the bill?", "NTA.

They're taking advantage of you.", "That was my question - it would never occur to me to park in someone else\u2019s *driveway* like ever.", "Oh honey - you need to post your driveway and develop a relationship with an commercial tow company.   Put flyers in your neighbors mailboxes, post on your local Listserv/Facebook/NextDoor and get that mf towed the next time it happens.  You\u2019ll miss work that day (commercial tow trucks aren\u2019t as common) but what you are describing is absolutely unacceptable.", "I have an area behind my garage that faces on an alley it is big enough to park a car on. It is my property.  \n\nThe street behind me is small townhouses and parking is limited (like people sometimes need to park on surrounding streets and walk back to their house).  Although I consider myself a good neighbor - having people park in that space as if it was street parking does bother me.  I put up a \u201cno parking private property\u201d sign which helped and then I had a second vehicle (a truck) that I kept parked there for several years.  After I sold that vehicle, I put planters out to block off the parking.   I don\u2019t feel bad about it - it\u2019s my property.  I\u2019m sure the folks who live in the townhouses would like that extra parking space.  \n\nOP needs to post signs - no parking, violators will be towed and sync up with a tow company so the sign can post their number when the cars actually get towed.  And then call the tow truck.", "My across the street neighbor does this in front of her house.  Our street allows parking on one side.  (I park behind my house off the alley so it doesn\u2019t affect me.)\n\nShe got a permit for a curb cut and put in a parking space for one car on the front of the house (she also has blacktop space for two cars in the back, just saying) - the curb in front of her house has room for two cars and she will park her car on the street right in the middle of those two spots.  Won\u2019t park on her own property at all - just taking up two spaces on the street. \n\nI\u2019ve talked with her once when a tree in my front yard fell down after a storm and the whole neighborhood was out to look at it while the police were there - but dang, to have ~3 parking spaces on your own property and decide to use 2 on the street for one car - that\u2019s PETTY.\n\nETA: I\u2019m so glad I had the opportunity to post this here because I\u2019ve been itching to call her out on NEXTDOOR - but since I can do it here anonymously itch is scratched for now.", "This. I was visiting my father in Greenwich Village back in\u2026 \u201889, maybe? 5-6 times a day someone would ring his buzzer, he\u2019d go meet them at the elevator, then come back in three minutes later.

Fine. \n\nProvide an avenue for others to make poor choices while you make some cash? Still not great, but it's not my body. \n\nCustomers using in my driveway? We're done. I carry narcan, but I'd rather not use it while calling the EMTs to my own house. \n\nOnce I pointed out to the chief that we are also within spitting distance of the elementary school at which his wife is a teacher, and that these customers were also indulging their need in the school parking lot? There was a crackdown the next day. \n\n\n\nThen the house caught fire six months later and the fire department had to use extra precautions in case it was a potentially explosive or contaminated lab... but that's another story. \n\n\n\nThe neighbor is now deceased - in another house fire.

They didn't believe me until their next party where people parked trucks in my grass and the police came to issue tickets and impound what they could and get the rest towed. The guests quickly moved trucks they could get to tearing across my yard into his (ruining his well manicured grass) and a few got tickets. It stopped after that.
