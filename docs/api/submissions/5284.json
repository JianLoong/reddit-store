First she has a good point about the resentment, second as the one harmed by this I think she should have the final say in what you do.", "Ywbta. Amy is right your are going to create a huge issue between the two. Have you talked to the kid, or just lost your mind and gone for punishment? Kid do dick things you need to talk to him and have him understand the consequences of how his actions impact Amy.", "Ywbta\n\nHe's already grounded, and the only thing it will do is make him resent you and Amy and hate christmas for the rest of his life.

Was he showing off?  Did he learn it from your sister?  etc. \n\nLearning sign language as a child when he has a step-parent who is mostly deaf should not be an option.  How does it work, he just doesn't communicate with Amy unless they are facing each other and she can read his lips?  Many schools now offer ASL as a \"foreign language\", he would easily be able to do that and not impact his sports.  Please look for a creative way to have him learn, it will probably help their overall relationship.", "YWBTA.  I agree with Amy, and you should defer to her as she is the one who was mocked.", "YWBTA. \n\nYour son has seen an older relative do the exact same thing, and has modelled that behaviour. Now would be a great time to sit him down with Amy and explain why him doing that isn\u2019t okay, how it makes Amy feel, etc. - this has the potential to be a learning moment, and taking away his presents is just going to create more animosity than anything.", "You need a different punishment. I would make him apologise to your wife and you also need to have a talk to him about ableism and bullying.

Taking away Xmas presents is not going to help there", "YTA\n\nIf you think taking presents away from a child us going to do anything positive, think again. \n\nThere is a problem that sits within your family. You sister thought it was funny to make fun of someone's speech. Now your son is copying this behaviour. You need to get your son to recognise that he is disrespecting your wife. You need to speak to him to find out what it is that he doesn't like about her and why. Has she done some to make him feel this way or is he copying your sister's behaviour? Ask him how would he feel someone in his home was making fun about him behind his back. How would he react to that? Compare his answer to what she had done. Let him know how your wife feels about him and how disappointed she is with the way he is treating someone who cares about him. Hopefully they have a good relationship for him to realise the impact his behaviour has on her.\n\nYou need to parent your child to respect others in spite of their disabilities. He needs to learn to respect others. Above all of this,  you need to find out what's causing his attitude to be bad.", "Yes, YWBTA.  Charlie is 13, as a parent, it's a great opportunity to talk with him as more than a \"child.\"  And tell him that.  How would it make him feel if he were teased or bullied over  speech and hearing issues? I'm pretty sure that grounding is enough punishment, especially over Winter break.  I'm sure he'd love to hang out with his friends.  Teens sometimes make bad decisions, just like we did.  Don't go overboard on this.", "YWBTA.\n\nOf course his actions is completely wrong. But no-one learns anything from punishment and Amy is right. He will just grow to hate her. \n\nIt is your responsibility as a parent to teach him right from wrong. Do that instead. Talk to him about why it is completely unacceptable. Listen to why he did it. Help him be more inclusive about people who are different. But grounding him and taking away gifts are by no means teaching him anything!\n\nI know this is probably also a cultural issue. I am not from the US but it seems \"punishment\" is much more accepted as a way of parenting there.", "YWBTA - grounding (for now) is enough - don\u2019t go defcon and then have him resent Amy.

Get Ross Greene's book Raising Human Beings andclearn better parenting skills, especially how to come alongside kids to collaborate either them rather jan pushing them down and hurting hem with punishments that don't work anyway. Punishment only destroys relationships. It does not change future behavior. Tell him how much his teasing hurts. Ask if hurting Amy was his goal. If it was, get curious about why. If not, let his own conscience be his guide about stopping that behavior. He is young. He doesn't understand that she can only produce the sounds she hears. Ask him to imagine what it's like to not hear all the sounds, how it cuts her off from people, how his teasing makes something that already hurtful even more hurtful. Remember that it's Christmas. Give him the gift of forgiveness. You won't regret it.", "Not at you dating a 21 year old at 32 \ud83e\udd22", "Yes you would BTA if you took away his Christmas presents.

He's 13 and old enough to understand about bullying and mocking disabilities.\n\nAnd probably learning sign language as a family would be a good idea.", "YTA.\n\nNot for wanting to punish him but for using christmas presents to do so.  Take away his access to electronics, or ground him from hanging out with his friends, but don't turn a holiday about goodwill, giving, and happiness into a big ole punishment unless you plan on including a lump of coal in his stocking with a note about making fun of Amy.  That would be fine to do that as a reminder that it's shitty behavior.", "YWTA! Apart from grounding sit and explain him the reason. Ultimately punishing is not only your job teaching also.", "YTA. Grounding is fine. Taking away his xmas presents just means he's going to resent both you and Amy. Listen to Amy on this one.", "Nah. Your son probably deserves to have his presents removed, but your wife is right. This will make their relationship worse not better. His \"punishment\" should not be Xmas related, but instead to apologize and do something to make amends to her. Is there something she does to care for others in your house or community that you and he can take over together? If you assign him something alone he'll half ass it. If you do it together and narrate the caring part of the experience it will hit home more.", "Yta Amy is right punish Charlie after Christmas.

Where they see being nasty too each other as a \u2018joke\u2019 and just a \u2018laugh\u2019 but i think its too far taking everything away from him.

After all, he leaned it from somewhere. Wouldn\u2019t sitting down (you, Amy and your teen) and having a heartfelt discussion about how his comments affect the family and teach him more about Amy\u2019s hearing problems be the better thing in the long run?

He's 13.", "Firstly- did you call out your sister in front of him? Did he hear her mocking your girlfriend? If you called out your sister personally and did not afterwards told your son that she did wrong you have to.\n\nHe is a kid. And if he has seen another grown up doing that, she was not called out for it directly, he might assume it's is nothing bad at all. Just a fun thing. My kid has done some bad things as \"fun\" but I have explained why it is bad and the consequences if he will continue.\n\nIf you have called your sister out and explained everything to your son previously I believe that YWBTA  if you would take away his presents. Taking away Christmas presents are something I do not consider as a form of punishment. Even your girlfriend does not think so. She was the one who got mocked and I believe she does have a say in this also. It will damage our relationship and what you want is to improve the overall atmosphere not make it worse. \n\nIf you have not explained to your son anything- YTA already. You can NOT punish someone without explanation. That is not a good way of handling situations. If you have not explained it to him previously that you have called out your sister and given her a hard time about the mocking, if you have not explained the difference between the casual joke and bullying- DO IT NOW! It is our responsibility as a parent to teach these things. We all make mistakes. Kids make them constantly. But parents need to be there to guide them the right way. You have to be patient and understanding. Even though he is already 13 he might not understand  a lot of things yet.\n\nThat being said- don't ruin your and your family's Christmas. Sit down with your son. Explain why you did what you did. Why you got mad. And enjoy a lovely celebration.", "YTA: the punishment doesn't really fit the crime, and your other child did tell you not to for a very understandable reason  \n\n\ni think punishments should be consisent and within reason, and you can't exactly take away gifts each time, and all you do is making him hate you and his sister.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He lives more than half-time with Amy and your letting him opt out sign language was a signal to him that accommodating her disability was optional.   You need to backup and have a serious discussion with him about his callous disregard for his stepmother.    \n\nAdd another non-optional gift: sign language lessons.   If that means he has to skip another activity for the next few months, so be it.

I get it. This would be easy and it would give you the dopamine kick of being Leila\u2019s white knight and savior. The thing is, this would be really shitty parenting. Your son needs you to talk to him. Nobody benefits from these dramatic gestures except your ego. Let me be very clear, Leila also gets screwed when you set up a situation where her stepson hates her. \n\nA better consequence (I wouldn\u2019t even call it punishment) is to sign up our son up for a signing class. Each week that he attends and improves, he gets out of being grounded. He can learn something AND create a positive association with ASL.

This is what I have learned- for example, if a kid will try to light a lighter and you will just say \"Don't do it!\" it is very likely he will try again. If you tell him \"If you will do it you will burn your skin and it is going to be very painful.\" the chances are they will not try to do it again.\n\nAnd also make the chat a proper conversation, not a lecture. Kids do not hold attention well for long periods and he more than likely will zone off if you will just talk and talk and talk...\n\nFirstly ask him why he did what he did? Where did it come from?

Why immigrants sound so different while 2nd gens who were raised speaking multiple languages sound fluent in both. It's a good opportunity for learning.

Please, for the love of not scarring your child unnecessarily, don't. I know you're angry. Your family already got your defenses up where Amy is concerned, and your son is exacerbating that.

You want to teach him a lesson, and one needs to be taught, but you won't be teaching him the right lesson by taking away his presents and you'll be irreparably harming any chance Amy has of forming a lasting relationship with him. He's 13, so I'm guessing he's a bit of an asshole overall at this point. He's probably pushing your buttons just to see what reaction he'll get. Pushing his boundaries to see how far he'll get and figure out what to do with any distance he gains. Hang on, buddy. It's going to be a rough ride, but if you put your HEART into it, it'll be worth it. \nFor right now, with Amy, talk to your son, the three of you, and CALMLY explain to him why his mocking of her speech is both beneath him and insensitive. Ask him if there's any particular reason he would want to hurt Amy or yourself (he may know your family triggers you with this and is testing another of your 'buttons'), if there's anything in particular that's bothering him that you can resolve together. Your goal here is based on him: you want to help him actually think through what he did and his reasoning behind it and you want to give him an open space to air any grievances he may have that are causing him to lash out. LISTEN to what he says and don't demand he give you the answers to the questions you ask. Making him think on it and being calm with anything he opens up to you about are the goals. You probably won't agree with any grievances he has. That's fine. Listen to what he has to say and do your damndest to see it from his view (young, ignorant, hormonal, and emotional). Check your understanding with him, repeat his view back succinctly so he knows you listened, then explain your viewpoint in return and ask what kind of compromise he might suggest. Work from there. He's only 13, but he'll appreciate being treated as an equal in conversations and being a part of solutions. You can work towards these types of communications with him and make consequences appropriate and calm (don't be afraid to tell him you're too upset and need some time to calm down before determining an appropriate punishment so that you can do exactly that). \nFor a consequence for his actions now, I'd suggest the three of you going to do something together that is traditionally difficult for Amy with her limitations so that he can witness the struggle behind the target of his bullying.", "Taking away Christmas presents as a punishment is a terrible idea, every time.

There needs to be discussion, he needs to understand how hurtful this behavior is. The emphasis should be on making reparations. What can he do to demonstrate he feels bad about his behavior? You can involve him in this. He could offer to take over chores that your wife normally does. Perhaps he should be required to take some sign language classes or do some research on deaf culture. If there are influences in his life that you believe are contributing to callous behavior, then it might make sense to remove those influences for awhile, so there might be a case for a social media blackout for awhile, for instance.\n\nIf he shows no remorse, continues to deflect, thinks it's no big deal, etc. then there needs to be some family therapy. \n\nSometimes kids act out and do stupid things and feel bad about it, and need help figuring out ways to mend and repair relationships. Sometimes kids do mean things because they have a lot of resentment and hurt bottled up and it leaks out in other ways, which is where therapy comes in. Does he resent Amy or the new sibling?
