First she has a good point about the resentment, second as the one harmed by this I think she should have the final say in what you do.", "Ywbta. Amy is right your are going to create a huge issue between the two. Have you talked to the kid, or just lost your mind and gone for punishment? Kid do dick things you need to talk to him and have him understand the consequences of how his actions impact Amy.", "Ywbta\n\nHe's already grounded, and the only thing it will do is make him resent you and Amy and hate christmas for the rest of his life.

Was he showing off?  Did he learn it from your sister?  etc. \n\nLearning sign language as a child when he has a step-parent who is mostly deaf should not be an option.  How does it work, he just doesn't communicate with Amy unless they are facing each other and she can read his lips?  Many schools now offer ASL as a \"foreign language\", he would easily be able to do that and not impact his sports.  Please look for a creative way to have him learn, it will probably help their overall relationship.", "YWBTA.  I agree with Amy, and you should defer to her as she is the one who was mocked.", "YWBTA. \n\nYour son has seen an older relative do the exact same thing, and has modelled that behaviour. Now would be a great time to sit him down with Amy and explain why him doing that isn\u2019t okay, how it makes Amy feel, etc. - this has the potential to be a learning moment, and taking away his presents is just going to create more animosity than anything.", "You need a different punishment. I would make him apologise to your wife and you also need to have a talk to him about ableism and bullying.

Taking away Xmas presents is not going to help there", "YTA\n\nIf you think taking presents away from a child us going to do anything positive, think again. \n\nThere is a problem that sits within your family. You sister thought it was funny to make fun of someone's speech. Now your son is copying this behaviour. You need to get your son to recognise that he is disrespecting your wife. You need to speak to him to find out what it is that he doesn't like about her and why. Has she done some to make him feel this way or is he copying your sister's behaviour? Ask him how would he feel someone in his home was making fun about him behind his back. How would he react to that? Compare his answer to what she had done. Let him know how your wife feels about him and how disappointed she is with the way he is treating someone who cares about him. Hopefully they have a good relationship for him to realise the impact his behaviour has on her.\n\nYou need to parent your child to respect others in spite of their disabilities. He needs to learn to respect others. Above all of this,  you need to find out what's causing his attitude to be bad.", "Yes, YWBTA.  Charlie is 13, as a parent, it's a great opportunity to talk with him as more than a \"child.\"  And tell him that.  How would it make him feel if he were teased or bullied over  speech and hearing issues? I'm pretty sure that grounding is enough punishment, especially over Winter break.  I'm sure he'd love to hang out with his friends.  Teens sometimes make bad decisions, just like we did.  Don't go overboard on this.", "YWBTA.\n\nOf course his actions is completely wrong. But no-one learns anything from punishment and Amy is right. He will just grow to hate her. \n\nIt is your responsibility as a parent to teach him right from wrong. Do that instead. Talk to him about why it is completely unacceptable. Listen to why he did it. Help him be more inclusive about people who are different. But grounding him and taking away gifts are by no means teaching him anything!\n\nI know this is probably also a cultural issue. I am not from the US but it seems \"punishment\" is much more accepted as a way of parenting there.", "YWBTA - grounding (for now) is enough - don\u2019t go defcon and then have him resent Amy.

Get Ross Greene's book Raising Human Beings andclearn better parenting skills, especially how to come alongside kids to collaborate either them rather jan pushing them down and hurting hem with punishments that don't work anyway. Punishment only destroys relationships. It does not change future behavior. Tell him how much his teasing hurts. Ask if hurting Amy was his goal. If it was, get curious about why. If not, let his own conscience be his guide about stopping that behavior. He is young. He doesn't understand that she can only produce the sounds she hears. Ask him to imagine what it's like to not hear all the sounds, how it cuts her off from people, how his teasing makes something that already hurtful even more hurtful. Remember that it's Christmas. Give him the gift of forgiveness. You won't regret it.", "Not at you dating a 21 year old at 32 \ud83e\udd22", "Yes you would BTA if you took away his Christmas presents.

He's 13 and old enough to understand about bullying and mocking disabilities.\n\nAnd probably learning sign language as a family would be a good idea.", "YTA.\n\nNot for wanting to punish him but for using christmas presents to do so.  Take away his access to electronics, or ground him from hanging out with his friends, but don't turn a holiday about goodwill, giving, and happiness into a big ole punishment unless you plan on including a lump of coal in his stocking with a note about making fun of Amy.  That would be fine to do that as a reminder that it's shitty behavior.", "YWTA! Apart from grounding sit and explain him the reason. Ultimately punishing is not only your job teaching also.", "YTA. Grounding is fine. Taking away his xmas presents just means he's going to resent both you and Amy. Listen to Amy on this one.", "Nah. Your son probably deserves to have his presents removed, but your wife is right. This will make their relationship worse not better. His \"punishment\" should not be Xmas related, but instead to apologize and do something to make amends to her. Is there something she does to care for others in your house or community that you and he can take over together? If you assign him something alone he'll half ass it. If you do it together and narrate the caring part of the experience it will hit home more.", "Yta Amy is right punish Charlie after Christmas.

Where they see being nasty too each other as a \u2018joke\u2019 and just a \u2018laugh\u2019 but i think its too far taking everything away from him.

After all, he leaned it from somewhere. Wouldn\u2019t sitting down (you, Amy and your teen) and having a heartfelt discussion about how his comments affect the family and teach him more about Amy\u2019s hearing problems be the better thing in the long run?

He's 13.", "Firstly- did you call out your sister in front of him? Did he hear her mocking your girlfriend? If you called out your sister personally and did not afterwards told your son that she did wrong you have to.\n\nHe is a kid. And if he has seen another grown up doing that, she was not called out for it directly, he might assume it's is nothing bad at all. Just a fun thing. My kid has done some bad things as \"fun\" but I have explained why it is bad and the consequences if he will continue.\n\nIf you have called your sister out and explained everything to your son previously I believe that YWBTA  if you would take away his presents. Taking away Christmas presents are something I do not consider as a form of punishment. Even your girlfriend does not think so. She was the one who got mocked and I believe she does have a say in this also. It will damage our relationship and what you want is to improve the overall atmosphere not make it worse. \n\nIf you have not explained to your son anything- YTA already. You can NOT punish someone without explanation. That is not a good way of handling situations. If you have not explained it to him previously that you have called out your sister and given her a hard time about the mocking, if you have not explained the difference between the casual joke and bullying- DO IT NOW! It is our responsibility as a parent to teach these things. We all make mistakes. Kids make them constantly. But parents need to be there to guide them the right way. You have to be patient and understanding. Even though he is already 13 he might not understand  a lot of things yet.\n\nThat being said- don't ruin your and your family's Christmas. Sit down with your son. Explain why you did what you did. Why you got mad. And enjoy a lovely celebration.", "YTA: the punishment doesn't really fit the crime, and your other child did tell you not to for a very understandable reason  \n\n\ni think punishments should be consisent and within reason, and you can't exactly take away gifts each time, and all you do is making him hate you and his sister.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He lives more than half-time with Amy and your letting him opt out sign language was a signal to him that accommodating her disability was optional.   You need to backup and have a serious discussion with him about his callous disregard for his stepmother.    \n\nAdd another non-optional gift: sign language lessons.   If that means he has to skip another activity for the next few months, so be it.

I get it. This would be easy and it would give you the dopamine kick of being Leila\u2019s white knight and savior. The thing is, this would be really shitty parenting. Your son needs you to talk to him. Nobody benefits from these dramatic gestures except your ego. Let me be very clear, Leila also gets screwed when you set up a situation where her stepson hates her. \n\nA better consequence (I wouldn\u2019t even call it punishment) is to sign up our son up for a signing class. Each week that he attends and improves, he gets out of being grounded. He can learn something AND create a positive association with ASL.

This is what I have learned- for example, if a kid will try to light a lighter and you will just say \"Don't do it!\" it is very likely he will try again. If you tell him \"If you will do it you will burn your skin and it is going to be very painful.\" the chances are they will not try to do it again.\n\nAnd also make the chat a proper conversation, not a lecture. Kids do not hold attention well for long periods and he more than likely will zone off if you will just talk and talk and talk...\n\nFirstly ask him why he did what he did? Where did it come from?

There are no easy solutions here.", "YWBTA. Taking Christmas presents would be surely easy but counterproductive. You want him to stop doing this, not just being upset he didn't get his presents and resent Amy and you.\n\nIf you think you don't need to teach him making fun of someone is bad, this situation is just the proof you should have. \n\nIt would be better to give him deafening earplugs and record him talking so he can see how he also talk differently in this situation. Or anything else related to no bullying or not making fun of a disability. You need to teach him, that's your job as a parent : teach your children what they don't understand yet, or forgot.", "Oh honey, you're punishing him for *your* parenting failures.\n\n\"I don't think I need to tell him\" is very clearly the wrong way of looking at this.\n\nYour son should have been learning sign language this whole time. You missed the mark on that. It's not just for your wife, it will help him help others who rely on sign language as well. It is a valuable skill to learn, not a punishment.\n\nA good therapist can help you get to the root of your feelings on this. Taking away Christmas isn't the right choice.", "Honestly get noise canceling headphones or get a regular pair blast music have him keep them in for a while to see how he feels not being able to hear and rely on reading lips", "This is the second post I've read about taking away Christmas presents as punishment. How does any parent not know that is a horrible punishment and achieves nothing but resentment? And what do the children learn, that they aren't allowed to partake in a celebration that emphasizes giving and goodwill?  Charlie and your sister are both in need of some empathy and anti-bullying education, because that is what both are doing, bullying. Your sister needs to not be around your family if she as an adult chooses to make fun of another adult. She is unduly influencing bad behavior. Charlie needs to give up a few social outings or sports outings and told that until his social skills improve you can't allow him to be where he can easily bully others if he feels comfortable enough to do it at home.\n\n**EDIT:**  YWBTA if you don't do something proactive to protect your wife from your sister and find some redirection for Charlie that would have a positive outcome as in counseling. To think that your wife can't be herself and comfortable in her own home because of your sister and you calling her out and then \"putting it to bed,\" let alone having Charlie do the same. Charlie's mother needs to be involved. She might have some ideas to steer him in the right direction.", "So instead of being a father and sitting your kid down to talk to him about how rude and disrespectful it is to do that.. you want to jump straight to \"I care more about her than I do you\" and push him closer to your sister who is the real issue?\n\nYTA.

I presume he doesn\u2019t know what he is getting.", "YWBTA ask him where he eard those words from. And let him know like you did with your sister", "Better strategy: talk to his Mom and take away an extracurricular and put him in sign language classes.", "YWBTA \n\nYes, he should be disciplined, but taking away his Christmas isn't the way to go about things. I think making him learn some sign language and maybe learn about deaf culture (maybe with an essay for you?) Or something along those lines would be better.", "Jeez dude, there are a million ways to deal with this that do not include cancelling Christmas. YWBTA here, find a more suitable way to deal with it rather than making everyone miserable", "YTA if you take away the Christmas gifts - however I suggest you turn this into a teachable moment, if there is a deaf community in your area - Maybe let him spend the day there, seeing what it is like to be unable to communicate with anyone - where he is the minority, maybe he\u2019ll learn some empathy for his step mom.", "Op should make his son learn sign language and history/culture", "Good answer. What about having to volunteer for the Holidays?", "So? People love to act like getting presents on Christmas is the ultimate proof of familial love. \n\nIt\u2019s not. Treating gift receiving as this huge thing that proves your parents love you is stupid. \n\nThis kid deserves not to have any presents for mocking a disabled persons voice. \n\nJust think about what\u2019s worse: not getting presents vs having your self esteem and confidence destroyed multiple times", "I\u2019d like to point out that this might be a cultural thing in terms of this particular age gap. My husband is a CODA (Child of Deaf Adult) and both of his parents are profoundly deaf, so over the years I\u2019ve learned that the deaf/HoH community VERY MUCH has its own culture. OP mentioned that his wife prefers sign language, and most people prefer to date and marry a partner that they can easily communicate with. Add in that they are teaching their youngest sign language leads me to believe that he signs fluently as a second language. ASL is incredibly difficult to learn and if he took it as a second language requirement for school he would have been required to attend a number of deaf events. It can be hard to date outside of the community and it stands to reason that he probably made friends and connections at these events and continued to attend, likely leading to how they met and her comfort with dating a non-native speaker. I\u2019m certainly not an expert, but I think just knowing even a little bit about the deaf community very easily makes this much less about age", "Don't turn volunteer work into community service work. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with sitting the kid down and explaining \"hey, this behavior is shitty, here's why, let's fix it.\" Instead.", "Volunteer work should never be seen as a punishment. You\u2019re basically saying it\u2019s a terrible thing to do and therefore fits the purpose of punishment being a bad time", "Poor and/or disabled people don\u2019t exist as lessons for others.", "He should be encouraged to volunteer at a school for deaf children. Then he would be unable to communicate with the majority of the people around him, much like his step-mom must do every day. He might learn some empathy and a few ASL words pretty quickly. His reward can be something big. Money towards his first car, or towards a savings account for spending money for college. That way he is showing up willingly, and can still get some perspective.", "She was 13 when this boy was born.

A younger person guess after a more set mature person because the older person is more willing to send Duan and have a kid. Since prior do want kids. Since people just want to be a wife and mother.

Just ignoring predatory situations is what helps them be normalised even more.", "That's often *exactly why* the younger party is into the relationship, though, and there's nothing wrong with that.", ">And of course he immediately baby trapped her. \n\nWhat a crazy thing to say, as if she had no choice in it whatsoever.\n\nOr as if she can't at any moment just decide to leave OP after having the kid.", "11 years is huge when it\u2019s more than half of her life."]}
