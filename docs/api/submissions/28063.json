They got married in May and are expecting their first baby in December. \n\nWe all co signed a lease and are still contracted another 8 months (6 months after the baby\u2019s due). I for one adore children and even work in a child care centre. \n\nMy roommates have always been incredibly lazy. I cook everyone\u2019s meals, clean the dishes, vacuum, mow the lawns and pick up after THEIR dog that is always pooing inside and gets into everything. (I also agreed to an outside pet and we are not met to have any according to our lease agreement). \n\nAll of our friends were excited about the pregnancy and I was at first too. But now I\u2019m filled with dread. \n\nAt this points it\u2019s important to note that RM2 hasn\u2019t held a steady job in 3 years. So they always \u201ctight\u201d on money, unless the spending benefits them. While RM1 has 2 jobs, but is always off \u201csick\u201d. I use \u201csick\u201d as this was an issue even before the pregnancy. There have been multiple occasions where I have had to cover their rent and groceries (and I\u2019ve never been paid back). \n\nRM1 spends most of her time laying in bed complains that she\u2019s too ill to work or help around the house, but is ok to go out 3 nights a week and continues to play weekend sports. And RM2 always has an excuse to why he\u2019s not helping or he \u201cwill get to it later\u201d. As a result I\u2019m completely burnt out from maintaining the house, working 2 jobs, studying and looking after my 27-30year old children. \n\nWhen ever someone offers them any advice or assistance during the pregnancy they\u2019ll reply \u201cbut OP will help with the baby\u201d. And the closer it gets to baby\u2019s due date, the more they shift the responsibility of their unborn child onto me: \n\u201cOP will babysit\u201d\n\u201cOP will buy this, that etc\u201d \n\nAnd the comment that pushed me over the edge was \n\u201cIf we\u2019re too tired we\u2019ll move the cot into OPs room, she can deal with it\u201d.\n\nTo which I replied they shouldn\u2019t have a baby when they can\u2019t look after themselves, and that I refuse to responsible for their kid. This made RM1 cry, but I don\u2019t feel bad, it was long over due to be said, but they\u2019re now mad at me saying  that I\u2019m \u201ctoo young to know the stress of having kids\u201d. Half our mutual friends are on my side, and the other half are just mad that I said it, rather about what I said. Am I the asshole? \n\nThe easiest solution would be to move out, but currently everything in my area is out of my price range. I\u2019ve even applied for a few places on my own but am unfortunately unsuccessful due too lack of rental history, and the one I due have is ruined due their dog being inside, despite countless efforts to move him into the yard.", "created_utc": 1696252325, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xwax3/aita_for_telling_my_roommates_they_shouldnt_have/", "score": 906, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Precisely what type of fuckery is this? Why are you helping these people who are barely functional? Why would you wonder if you are an asshole when someone just said she plans to put HER future baby in your room, should the need arise. It doesn't matter if they are struggling, tired, sick, in pain or just plain incompetent, it does not follow that you become their caretaker and bank. Make it perfectly clear, OP, that you will not care for the baby at all. The guy is unemployed for God's sake, he has nothing to do but take care of the baby. You need to move out ASAP. Get those footprints off of your back", "NTA. its time to stop being their mum and start being a roommate. stop cooking for them and only clean up after yourself. if you are going to be cleaning, do it when it suits you, im assuming that they stay up late at night, so start cleaning early morning", "You've made yourself far too indispensible to them so if you don't complain, the'll assume, 'But OP enjoys doing it!'

When they are evicted you can get more socially acceptable roomates.", "NTA. But why are you cooking everyone's meals? The part about cleaning and maintaining the apartment I get since you are on the lease, but buying groceries and cooking for them your just enabling their behavior. \n\nThe reason they are so sure you'll take responsibility for their baby is cause you have taken responsibility for them without a fuss, you need to stop that now. Barricade in you room, buy groceries only for yourself and keep them in your room if you can get a mini fridge, stop cooking for them, talk to the landlord and tell him you'll be give him your share of the rent and he needs to collect your roommates share.

I prepare all meals and clean up after. It isn\u2019t sustainable and as you will both be parents soon, it\u2019s time for me to take a step back. Going forward I won\u2019t be making meals for the household, and I will clean my own dishes and any messes made in the common areas- but no more.

Part of this is on you for enabling them for so long and waiting until you were feeling so extra before finally speaking up. You can't change them, but you CAN and SHOULD change the way you've been enabling them.\n\nSTOP loaning them any money for rent or utilities.\n\nSTOP cooking dinner for them.  \n\nGet a LOCK for your bedroom door and keep your nonperishable food and valuables in the locked room.  This will also be helpful after the baby comes if they try to bring the baby into your room.\n\nStart looking for a new living situation IMMEDIATELY and relentlessly.

My friends (one I am no longer friends with) had a baby and seemed to be taking care of her. I was busy with school and I was involved in Theater so I wasn't home much. \n\nI came home at 2 am slightly buzzed after a cast party to find our 4th roommate sitting at the kitchen table covering her ears. I asked what was up. She told me the baby had been crying for HOURS and they had done nothing to stop it. I walked into the living room. The baby was in her bouncy seat screaming and had been for a while.  What were they doing? Playing the new Wii system they had just bought that day. I asked if anyone was going to take care of the baby. I was met with grunts and no actual words.\n\nI scooped her up.  She was freezing. I changed her soiled diaper and put her in some warm pajamas. I wrapped her in a warm blanket and went back to the living room. I walked up and unplugged the television and the Wii so I had their undivided attention.\n\n\"Hi. This screaming newborn? She's not mine. In case you've forgotten, she's your child. She should have been in bed hours ago. She's hungry, freezing, and exhausted. If the Wii is going to be that distracting that you can't take care of your own baby, I won't hesitate to smash the fucking thing. In the mean time, if I come home to her in this state again I am calling both your fucking parents and you can explain to them why a video game is more important than the life you created.\"\n\nI gently handed her over, took the Wii remotes and hid them in my room before going to bed.\n\nNever happened again. Don't let it get to thus point or worse OP.

Especially \"too young to know the stress of having kids\" - if it was me in that fuming state I would have retorted something of the sort of \"No, I am having you two for a while now, I know exactly how stressful it is\". \n\nYou need to draw clear boundaries starting now, OP. You are flatmates, you are not their handmaid or nanny, pet-sitter or whatever. You need to stomp your foot and split the house chores with them and if they cannot take care of themselves now, how will they do that with a baby? This includes also the money. They owe you money for rent and bills and you will be looking for a new accommodation in the next half a year. You need to settle these things before the baby comes or forget about it.", "I would say when baby comes just don't help. If they arnt taking proper care of the baby call social services. Not your circus not your clowns. Also report the dog to the landlord and make them take care of themselves. If they don't tell the landlord. It's not your responsibility to raise adults.

They got married in May and are expecting their first baby in December. \n\nWe all co signed a lease and are still contracted another 8 months (6 months after the baby\u2019s due). I for one adore children and even work in a child care centre. \n\nMy roommates have always been incredibly lazy. I cook everyone\u2019s meals, clean the dishes, vacuum, mow the lawns and pick up after THEIR dog that is always pooing inside and gets into everything. (I also agreed to an outside pet and we are not met to have any according to our lease agreement). \n\nAll of our friends were excited about the pregnancy and I was at first too. But now I\u2019m filled with dread. \n\nAt this points it\u2019s important to note that RM2 hasn\u2019t held a steady job in 3 years. So they always \u201ctight\u201d on money, unless the spending benefits them. While RM1 has 2 jobs, but is always off \u201csick\u201d. I use \u201csick\u201d as this was an issue even before the pregnancy. There have been multiple occasions where I have had to cover their rent and groceries (and I\u2019ve never been paid back). \n\nRM1 spends most of her time laying in bed complains that she\u2019s too ill to work or help around the house, but is ok to go out 3 nights a week and continues to play weekend sports. And RM2 always has an excuse to why he\u2019s not helping or he \u201cwill get to it later\u201d. As a result I\u2019m completely burnt out from maintaining the house, working 2 jobs, studying and looking after my 27-30year old children. \n\nWhen ever someone offers them any advice or assistance during the pregnancy they\u2019ll reply \u201cbut OP will help with the baby\u201d. And the closer it gets to baby\u2019s due date, the more they shift the responsibility of their unborn child onto me: \n\u201cOP will babysit\u201d\n\u201cOP will buy this, that etc\u201d \n\nAnd the comment that pushed me over the edge was \n\u201cIf we\u2019re too tired we\u2019ll move the cot into OPs room, she can deal with it\u201d.\n\nTo which I replied \u201c you shouldn\u2019t have a baby when you can\u2019t look after yourselves\u201d. This made RM1 cry, but I don\u2019t feel bad, it was long over due to be said, but they\u2019re now mad at me saying  that I\u2019m \u201ctoo young to know\u201d. Half our mutual friends are on my side, and the other half are just mad that I said it, rather about what I said. Am I the asshole? \n\nThe easiest solution would be to move out, but currently everything in my area is out of my price range. I\u2019ve even applied for a few places on my own but am unfortunately unsuccessful due too lack of rental history, and the one I due have is ruined due their dog being inside, despite countless efforts to move him into the yard.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
