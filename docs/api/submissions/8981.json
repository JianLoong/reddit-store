His father used to say he was lazy, but I supported him and now he has his second dream career at a great company. \n\nLast week I called him to eat at my house, but while I was making the food the gas ran out. When he arrived, I asked for $50  to buy the gas and finish cooking, as his father was yet to arrive from work. He gave me the money and a while later the gas delivery man arrived and I was able to finish cooking. \n\nThe next day he came to my house (to eat again) and during dinner he brought up the subject of money and mentioned that he would like me to pay him the $50. I asked why he thought I would pay him since he eats free at my house. He replied that my food is not worth $50. I was really upset because he really doesn't need $50 and I've already spent way more than that on him. \n\nThe last time he came to my house (he comes during his lunch break) he noticed that there wasn't a plate of food for him and asked where it was. I told him that if he wanted to eat he would have to pay me for the food. He said this was unfair and a jerk, I didn't listen to him and stopped him, saying the price was $49 because it wasn't worth $50. He left my house in a rage and now some family members are saying I was the asshole for it. I don't think so, but it doesn't hurt to ask. AITA?\n\nInfo: For the two years before he started college he lived rent-free and worked most of the time.\nAnd where I live we buy bottled gas because we don't have piped distribution.\nSome people didn't understand, so I'll explain. Even when I don't invite him, he always comes to my house for food and dinner. When I call him, it's to let him know that the food is ready, because it is already usually comes to eat at my house.", "created_utc": 1675374990, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10s25em/aita_for_charging_my_son_money_for_him_to_eat_at/", "score": 221, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not entirely sure but I think ESH", "NTA! \nBut I would have paid him back for the gas, and then mention to him that if he wants to eat at your house! He should contribute towards groceries. He seems to always go over to eat during his lunch, he is saving a lot of lot of money by not having to eat out. \nIf my mom was cooking lunch for me almost everyday, those $50 would have not been asked to be paid back. Even so, when I go to my mothers house, I will take some dessert, fruits or anything I know my mom enjoys.", "ESH. You don't charge guests to eat at your house. I'm sorry your son isn't more helpful to you, but you made him dinner as a gift, not as something you were going to get paid for.\n\n(Before any Americans jump in confused about the gas delivery, it is common in a lot of countries and how I fueled my gas stove when I lived in Central America)", "NTA. It is not like you planned on needing money to buy gas to finish cooking. It seems like he eats there all the time and of course it is family time, but if he is in a position to contribute every once in a while he should want to. He seems a bit selfish and entitled. I eat at home often and though I can't  cook I offer to pick up groceries or grab the family's favorite ice cream. They never ask me for money but it wouldn't  bother me because the cost of cooking does not just include food; it takes time and effort as well.\n\nEdit: Spelling", "ESH\n\nWhen you asked him for the 50$, he and everyone of us were under the impression you'd pay him back.\n\nGiven his insults, I wouldn't be cooking for him anymore either.\n\nBut you're the one who created this environment. You enabled him expecting lunch at your house because you made it everyday, even calling him to tell him it was ready. This is your parenting in action and you should take responsibility for it too.", "ESH. Y'all are petty.", "honestly NTA. asking for the $50 back was bad enough, but then backhandedly insulting your cooking and also coming over uninvited to eat said cooking? its ok to set boundaries, even with your son.", "Why do you call him to tell him the food is ready? Intake that as an invite. He should not have expected to be repaid m50 bucks since you\u2019re his mom  but the way you handled it was atrocious.", "YTA, you don't ask people over then charge them. You and your son have a weird relationship.", "ESH. I hope that between you y'all have enough cash to scrape together for family therapy.", "NTA and I don\u2019t understand all the hate. You\u2019ve been helping your son out in many ways, and when you needed help once, he couldn\u2019t come through, and then insulted the food he comes over to eat for free on a regular basis. He\u2019s not a guest. He comes over specifically for the meals that he claims aren\u2019t worth anything. So, take the money that you\u2019ve saved over all of the free unworthy meals you\u2019ve mooched, and go start buying your own lunches.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry but you simply cannot invite people over (regardless of who it is) and then charge them for food in any capacity. It\u2019s icky", "ESH: it\u2019s your child, but you\u2019re both adults do what you want. It\u2019s kinda rude though to make a guest pay for food in your house. I guess it also depends on the type of relationship you have with him. My grandparents raised me and while I live several hours away now and have my own place, I still have the key to their house and can go over whenever I want. The way you wrote your post makes it seem like you don\u2019t have a great relationship with your kid.", "ESH. Was the snarky comment worth your son avoiding you?", "YTA, you invited him and mentioned nothing about him needing to pay for the meal, so in his mind it was perfectly reasonable to assume he was lending money instead of being charged for a service. Now as to charging him in general I could see if he was being entitled, or raising your expenses above your means, but that doesn't sound like what's going on. I would also do an introspection as to wether you've been taking advantage of your son, as unless he's especially stingy or $50 is alot more where your from than heee in canada, it does seem weird that he wouldn't be willing to let it go unless this is just another thing compounded upon a bunch of other things you've asked him for without any notion of repaying him with either monetarily, with thanks, some form of service, or a promise of future assistance.", "YTA you invited him for dinner. Also, what? You use external gas cannisters for cooking? Are you off the grid or what?", "[deleted]", "YTA\n\nThat is some petty nastiness on your part. Unless you're serving filet mignon and caviar, your meal isn't worth $50. You are hateful to your own son.", "YTA. The way that you mention him having a great job now\u2026plus you saying you usually invite him over AFTER dinner is already cooked\u2026 I\u2019m getting the impression that you invited him over this time knowing you had no gas or money for the gas thinking he\u2019d just pay. Now you\u2019re guilt tripping him for wanting his money back. Not cool.", "ESH... He gets the AH for his entitlement to free lunches and snarky comment about food value.  But, If he expected to be paid back, he should have stated those terms for getting the gas in the first place.  You're the AH for playing the irritating \"be-grateful-that you exist\" card and returning his snarky comment.", "YTA, absolutely. He's your son, it shouldn't matter that he isn't living with you anymore. You only started asking him for money because you're mad he asked for his money (to buy your gas) back, and you're being petty. Do you charge people entry fees for dinner parties?  \n\n\nHonestly in hind sight I'd say EHS. Still, you don't charge guests for meals in your house, that's weird as hell.", "YTA. This is bizarre who charges their son for dinner? When you asked for $50 for gas yeah you should pay that back.", "YTA\n\nYou invited him over then took the money. If you want to charge your son for food, ok, but at least let him know in advance!", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s your kid, you don\u2019t invite people over and demand a fee. That\u2019s petty.", "YTA. Parenting isn't a tit-for-tat \"I took care of you for your childhood and now I get to demand money whenever\". If you'd asked him to stop at the store and pick up a $5 ingredient, that would be one thing, he'd look stingy asking for payback. But $50 isn't a small amount of money, that's like dinner for 2 at the Cheesecake Factory.", "YTA when you son has children in the future I hope he changes you a visitation fee to see your grandchildren, and a fee if you get old & need a ride to a doctors appointment, and a fee if you visit at the holidays and want a plate of food. Because money is more important to you than common decency especially since you INVITED him to dinner.", "If you claim him as a dependent on your taxes,you should not charge him for food.", "YTA, have fun not breaking bread with your son anymore.", "ESH sure your son shouldn't have been so nitpicky about lending you $50, you are family after all. But then you do the exact same to him by saying you let him live there rent free. But that's not what makes you the asshole, what makes you the asshole is your behavior after that. You are being petty and mean with what you are doing. How do you expect you son to chip in the expenses of a meal when you are acting like this.  \n\nThis could have easily been solved by you talking with him about how it hurt you that he wasn't able to share a bit with your expenses given how you are his mother. But you decided to act immaturely and inappropriately, all because you were offended.\n\nJust go talk to him, apologize for the whole asking money for a meal and living rent free, andd then talk about this with your son, explain how it made you feel and make up.", "ESH. I think you both are being a little immature. Do you need the money or do you not? Are you happy to cook for him or are you not? It sounds like you need to have a real conversation.", "NTA. Your son should learn to be more grateful for a mom like you. Unlike others, I never thought he should pay you back.\n And as to what others think, let them feed him.", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have asked for the $50 back bc your gas ran out. You should have offered and expected to pay him back. On the flip side, if I\u2019m mooching off good home food, you better believe I would offer to contribute one way or another or say \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it\u201d over the $50. Y\u2019all are having a pissing contest over the dumbest thing.", "If you expect your son to pay for the food you give him, that\u2019s something you need to give him a heads up on. You can\u2019t ask him for $50 on a whim that he thinks is a loan, then just drop it on him that you don\u2019t think you should have to pay it back. This is a conversation you should have had outside of a lunch situation. \n\nEither stop making him lunch or ask him to contribute towards your food shop. \n\nYTA", "ESH.\n\nIt's reasonable to ask him to contribute to food costs if you're feeding him frequently, and it would be nice if he would think to do that without being asked. And perhaps he could have let the $50 go.\n\nBut it's also reasonable for him to think he was just covering the immediate cost of the gas and expect to be paid back. Insisting he should pay it based on past generosity, freely given, isn't fair. Getting petty and making a scene of it was an overreaction.\n\nIf the problem is him not contributing in general, it would have been better to politely ask at another time if he would consider contributing a bit to groceries, now that he's older.", "My 2 oldest raid our fridge constantly when they are home. I could never imagine charging my adult kids to eat at our house.\nYOU let him live with you rent free so you can't hold that against him. My oldest moved back in with us for a short while to save money and we never even thought about charging him. Our other son is stationed in Georgia. His wife lived with us for 6 months before she moved down. We never once thought about charging her a penny.\nHe paid for your gas. My kids would have never brought it up but we would have just handed them the money the next time we saw them anyways. I feel like their is something else going on here. YTA", "ESH but mostly you. You are the parent. What parent charges their kid $50 for a meal? Or asks them to cover the gas because their dad isn't home and doesn't give it back? Like what?", "Wow - you both sound really petty. But I\u2019m going to give the slight nod to YTA since you\u2019re the parent and should be the \u201cbigger person\u201d in this relationship. (Though now that I think about it, this explains your son\u2019s behavior if that\u2019s all he\u2019s seen growing up).", "ESH. If you want him to contribute to the food costs or come less often, use your words like a grown up (and not after you never asked and then refuse to return the money he lent you). He just sucks for being a freeloader.", "ESH, him for being entitled and you for not putting your foot down. You are his meal ticket. You set a precedent that you'll always feed him. In your edit you say you call him to let him know food will be ready. Stop feeding him then", "Do you even like your son??", "ESH. If your son weren't around, you would still need gas to cook for your and your husband. That's on you. If money is tight, and it sounds like it is, he can't expect to always eat for free at your house without contributing.", "I'm gonna say you're the AH.", "wait so you invinted him for food and then asked him to pay.  \n\n\nYTA", "YTA, you shouldn\u2019t *want* to charge your son and you\u2019re going to pretty great lengths to do it.

I don't pig out, but she's messaged me saying she's happy I swung by and took some food. She likes knowing  im fed and that she can still take care of me without really taking care of me. \n\nAlso, what do you mean you've \"already spent way more than that on him\"? You're literally his mom. It was your job to provide for him. You're going to destroy your relationship with him if you haven't already.", "He's your son unless you're struggling financially he should be able to eat at your house free, especially if you invite him over. Now every day coming there for lunch is a bit much While your son he is a grown man.

But then there's this over emphasis on mothers to give everything they have to their children and maybe she felt uncomfortable asking if it's ok if  she kept the 50. She might be able to use it. She mentioned he's doing well.\n\nIt can be awkward when there's hurt feelings and misunderstandings. I think she should just tell him, I'm sorry, Son, you hurt my feelings when you asked for the money and I didn't want to say it. Hopefully he'll apologize for not helping out by contributing.
