But as a mom, who struggled to breastfeed and then moved to exclusively pumping (and supplemented with formula) I must remind you, there is no prize for only breastfeeding. If it\u2019s hurting you, if it\u2019s causing you pain, you should give serious thought to pumping. You can absolutely still have closeness with your child while feeding with a bottle, regardless of whether or not the bottle is filled with breastmilk or formula. The boob is not the only way to bond.", "NAH.  You are free to keep trying but your husband is not an AH for suggesting you switch to pumping.", "Funny, I was breastfeeding my 7 week old while reading this and have never been more grateful that babies in my family don't really cut teeth until they're almost one!\n\nFirst of all, babies who are teething tend to cluster feed while going through big milestones and teeth are a big milestone for sure! Not to mention they will breastfeed for comfort too. As long as his diaper output hasn't drastically decreased and he's gaining weight you're producing enough for him. \n\nSecondly, check your local hospitals and see if they have a breastfeeding group you can join, they do weighed feeds to reassure you about his weight gain and will certainly have tips for teething babies. La Leches League is also a group you could look up if your hospital doesn't provide any servies.\n\nNipple shields are helpful, you can also try unlatching your baby every time he bites down and eventually he will learn not to. Stick a pinky into the corner of his mouth to break the seal and it won't be painful to pull him off. Humankind has been breastfeeding for a long time without pumps and formula. Don't feel bad using those tools when you're overwhelmed!! I certainly use them myself. But also don't feel like you have no other option but to suffer through the pain or just stop altogether.\n\nAnd talk to your husband about your communication styles, this sounds like a classic \"I just want to vent\" vs \"I just want to fix it\" situation. A breastfeeding group would likely be a better place to vent most of your frustrations because everyone there has been through it or is going through it, but your husband needs to learn how to listen to be supportive instead of listening to respond. NAH so far but he's close to asshole territory because his advice is neither revolutionary nor helpful.", "It may have already been suggested, but have you tried nipple shields?", "NAH\n\nBabies nurse for comfort, too. So your little one is in pain, and the sucking brings relief. \n\nBabies also go for periods where they nurse all the time depending on growth spurts. \n\nYes, teething kids can bite. \n\nMy kids did not teeth till later that that though. Looking it up teething usually starts between 4-7 months, which tracks with my experience. (My kiddos are grown now) \n\nIf a child bite you the way I was told to handle it was to give a firm no-bite and remove the baby from the breast. Then allow them to latch on again. \n\nBecause he is so young though I would make sure you check with her pediatrician. It might just be a growth spurt coming. (I swear I felt like a 24 hr milk bar on some days) \n\nIt also depends on when he got the hang of it. If he just started really latching effectively, it's gonna hurt for a bit. \nBut eventually that goes away. \n\nI'm sure your doctor told you to count wet diapers and poop diapers to monitor intake. If your baby is pooping and peeing like they should, they are getting enough. \n\nI don't think your husband is an AH either, yet. He sees the woman he loves in pain and to him that pain is unnecessary, since their are other alternatives. \n\nI think you need to have a conversation with him and explain that when you are venting about motherhood, sometimes you just need a hug and some support.", "My youngest started teething at 3 months. Hyland's teething tablets were a lifesaver for me during nursing. The pain from teething interfered with latching on but those were like magic.", "NAH from what you've said. You certainly aren't an AH for wanting to continue breastfeeding. And it seems like your husband is just trying to come up with alternatives so that you aren't in pain from breastfeeding. I just hope he's bringing this up in a respectful and non-demanding way.", "NAH because you should do what feels right for you, and husband\u2019s reaction is coming from a place of concern.\n\nOnly because a few people are jumping in the comments to say breastfeeding is recommended for the first year\u2026 my 2 cents is that it gave me ppd and I didn\u2019t even realize it until I quit (after only 1 month). Felt like myself again the very next day. Quitting breastfeeding made me a better mom personally and my daughter and I are crazy close still (she is 3 now).\n\nEveryone is different! If you really love it, stick with it. Plenty of women do it for a very long time and really enjoy it for the bonding. I think that\u2019s awesome. But your husband is looking out for your best interests & overall well-being. Maybe hear him out too? You will be just as good of a mom if you formula feed and baby will be just as healthy. Whatever doesn\u2019t create resentment for you or make your life harder is the thing you should do. Parenting is hard enough!\n\nWhatever you decide, you\u2019re definitely not the asshole.", "NAH. \n\nBreastfeeding is hard for everyone involved including dad's, they want to fix issues and be involved too. He sees you struggling and knows there's a quick fix answer which seems perfectly logical to him, you seem illogical because you won't accept his 'help' \n\nYou want to continue which is obviously your choice. It's fantastic you kept going after your rocky start and you're a complete star for moving to exclusively breastfeed that's a freaking hard turn around!! \n\nCluster feeding when feeling icky isn't unusual for baby, it's a comfort thing as much as a feeding thing for baby :) \n\nIf you are worried about supply,. pumping can help reassure you your output is good as of course you can see it, it will also potentially help improve your supply if done correctly. \n\nDirty/wet nappies and weight gain are always the best indicator of getting enough, there's no set tim baby will feed. Some will feed for 20 mins and go 5 hours others will feed for 45 mins and do just a few hours. \n\nAlso have a look in your local area for breastfeeding support groups/cafes etc as they may be able to offer you advice on latch etc as it shouldn't be painful to feed and they may also be able to help with your concerns and understand the need to vent.\n\nUltimately remember to give both yourself and your husband grace, its a massive adjustment for you both mentally and physically xx", "No one is the asshole\n\nYou both just have to communicate and compromise. I don't think that there is something wrong with wanting to breastfeed but you should be careful. You said that it hurts sometimes, be mindful and cautious of that. Your baby might cause irritation or worse an infection if he bites an open wound. But I also understand the closeness you want with your baby. \n\nYour husband is just doing what a husband should be doing, caring and being concerned about his wife. If you don't want to stop breastfeeding, then I guess he can't stop you but just know that he is worried.", "Maybe switch to both? Have the first/last feed be breast then pump in between to give yourself a break but still have a closeness if nothing else works\n\nEither way NTA but dont be upset at your husband. He might not understand how close it may be for you and just wants to make sure youre okay. It can also seem \u201cstupid\u201d to him because he may not understand you enjoy it so much.

Fed is best. \n\nIf you have access to a lactation consultant (our hospital offered that service up to 1 year after birth, blessedly), it's so very worth it.

Generally only have to do this a couple times before they figure it out.   \n If you're having pain cause his latch isn't great cause of the teething gently stroke the nose and chin away from the breast when he's latched and that will help him settle into a better latch which should lessen the pain.   \nI used to be a breastfeeding counselor - nursing isn't just about food.

It's like using scisors to cut your nippl.\n\nIt might be because: baby's teeth grow (mine already had 2 at birth), baby doesn't know how to catch and keep the nipple (so baby closes his gums on you to prevent running food), your nipple hasn't formed yet  - like at the bottle, so baby catches something and doesn't release (this is where you can form the button by rotating it - or your SO \ud83d\ude09 and around here some dr advice during pregnancy to do so)\n\n- the more the baby latches, the more milk would be produced by your body - milk production is based on demand/offer.\n\nThe feeding should take around 40 minutes now (at 2 months)??? Don't remember exactly the duration of the meal, but there should have been some infos on the docs from the discharge (and you can ask the ped). If baby falls asleep after 5-10-15 minutes you can gently touch/tickle under nose, his jaw so that baby wakes up and start to eat.\n\n- After breastfeeding, eat some hot chicken soup (you will be starving) - and go to sleep as much as you can\n\n- Formula is the alternative. It helps if you don't have enough milk, to complete the meal.\n\nIt also helps in case you must go somewhere. With my second baby, born in Covid hospital, with me positive covid and baby negative, i knew i won't be seeing my baby until after the 2 weeks.\n\nSo baby was fed with formula because they didn't let anyone before me to send milk for the baby.\n\nI tried to stop or slow down the proces (for colostrum) and managed for 1 week. After that the milk started to come and i started pumping and arguing with the nurses (doctors said it was safe, the Health Department said it was safe and they have to do it) because they didn't wanted to give my milk to my baby. There were some hush hush things and everyone started happily taking the milk.\n\nThe problem was they started asking for more, but i wasn't able to do more because:\n\n- there wasn't enough food = no meat, no vegetables in the tastless watery \"soup\", plain rice (that's 4 lunch), 1 rice budding 4 evening = same rice from lunch, burned (black burned) & with a sprinkle of sugar. As 4 breakfast 2 slices of bread, 1 small glass (100-150 ml) of tea/yogurt, 1 slice of cheese (like in the mac for kids), 1 spoon of jam. I was starving. [well, they were stealing the food, everything you received was in so small servings ] \n\nSo as you can imagine, i needed to have more milk when i got out of the hospital. \n\nBaby refused formula after having my milk. Also, baby refused formula when i had to fight 2 months against an infection (from the hospital) and refused even when i went with the oldest for 2 weeks for a surgery for her. \n\nSo if your baby wants the formula, as extra or full meal, use it.

(She almost removed my nipple and I was already starting to dry up.) Fed is absolutely best, but people who can breastfeed and want to should be allowed to do so. They should also be allowed to voice their displeasure with certain aspects. I was pretty happy with breastfeeding until The Incident \u2122\ufe0f, but that doesn\u2019t mean every day was rainbows and sunshine. It was a brand new skill for me and my baby, so there was a learning curve.", "And get a good pump. That is not an area to skimp a few bucks a month in rental.", "Jumping on to say taking fenugreek really helped boost my supply when I was struggling.  \n\nMaybe it was just me, but pumping was so much more damn work than breastfeeding  - worst part of the whole experience for me.  I would not have switched over to straight pumping for anything.  Have you tried nipple shields?", "My husband is better at listening to me vent than I am him! I have had to start doing that for him, tbh. It takes the stress off of both of us.", "I would just like an ear that listens instead of immediately problem solving.", "Thank you, I'll be sure to do that.", "She\u2019s not though. There are other options like seeing a lactation consultant to figure out techniques that will work to discourage her baby from biting and to assess baby\u2019s latch for any issues that may cause pain. There may be stretches and positions that will help her baby nurse better. \n\nMany babies go through a biting phase but will quickly learn to stop but different responses work best for different babies.\n\nWhen I was having issues early on with BF, my husband located an IBCLC covered by insurance and made the appointment for me. He didn\u2019t just tell me \u201cpump or give formula\u201d because he knew nursing was important to me so he tried to help me achieve my goals.", "Because I've seen how the formula affects the baby, he throws it up each time and it hurts his stomach.", "This is so unbelievably rude", "\"It's not that I don't wanna hear about it at all, I just don't wanna hear about it over and over and OVER if you're not doing anything about it\"", "I will tell my partners \u201cI don\u2019t need you to suggest a solution I just want to vent\u201d sometimes", "Complaining over and over? She has a significant complaint and obviously formula isn\u2019t the answer for her, despite it being a solution for other situations or people. It\u2019s ok that she chooses to nurse through the discomfort and frankly, this is a marriage. Asking if your partner needs comfort or solutions is pretty basic emotional intelligence. Clearly she doesn\u2019t want formula suggested as a solution. \n\nSure it can\u2019t be easy for him. But at some point, just getting annoyed and offering the same solution you know isn\u2019t wanted, is more self serving than anything else.\n\nHe isn\u2019t exploring options or offering help beyond insisting on formula. \n\nExample, my husband hated seeing me in pain when learning to nurse. He offered, insisted, on formula. When I told him that as hard as this was, I wanted to see it through and would use formula if necessary, he offered other forms of help. \n\nLike telling me I was a good mum; bringing me snacks and water; checking to see if he could take baby once asleep so I could escape and not be touched for a while. \n\nThere are lots of other ways he can help out and support her, than offering the same unwanted advice.", "Mama, you're doing your absolute best and that is what baby needs \u2764\ufe0f \n\nI BF my first, and it was honestly hell. Everyone kept telling me I was \"doing it wrong\" and to \"just give it time\", but my milk took forever to come in, he wasn't getting enough, he massacred my nipples, and I was in so much pain constantly, every time I fed him, plus he refused bottles, and pumping got me nothing. He weaned at 12 months and it was glorious lol.\n\nwhen I got pregnant with #2, my husband looked me right in the eyes and said \"if you even think of trying to BF this one, I will not help with night waking, at all. Our baby needs YOU to be healthy, and will be fine on formula. If you aren't able to pump, oh well. Your mental and physical health are so much more important, and we can't have a healthy family without a healthy you.\" I took his words to heart, and now have 3 beautiful, healthy kids, 2 of them exclusively formula fed, and my PPD/PPA was quickly and easily managed by also focusing on my own health, physically and mentally. \n\nFed is best, always, and sometimes formula is your only option. You're not a failure, you're doing incredibly, and I'm rooting for you \ud83d\ude4f", "Definitely do not feel guilty! Having a baby in NICU is honestly the hardest thing I've ever done. \n\nBaby will be just fine with formula, but I also wanted to throw out there that bottle in NICU doesnt mean you definitely won't be able to breastfeed when babe comes home. I'm not saying that to pressure you, I'm hoping it makes you feel hopeful in case you wanted to try it. My first was a preemie and I wasn't allowed to nurse him while he was in NICU, but once he came home (2 weeks) I was able to breastfeed him until 32 months. I give a lot of credit to the NICU's lactation consultant who helped me both with the mechanics of it, suggestions for making the switch at home  but also she was super helpful with my mindset and reassuring me mentally when I too felt that guilt you're feeling right now. \n\nHang in there, I hope baby comes home soon, be gentle with yourself no matter what happens, but also don't give up preemptively if you do want to try breastfeeding once they're home!", "Yep. At the end of the day, there are benefits to breast milk that formula simply doesn\u2019t have and that\u2019s ok to admit. The issue is that those benefits become totally without value if the mother is not mentally well. Formula has a place. \n\nBreastfeeding was one of the hardest things I ever did. Kudos to those who make it past a year. I basically locked my bra shut on their first birthdays lol\n\nBut after experiencing it, I\u2019d never shame or think less of anyone who chose not to (not that I did before either, I just had more context)", "Fed is best.", "The recommendation is never to switch over.\n\nIt\u2019s EBF for six months and then continue to BF alongside complementary solids for two years and beyond if mutually desired by mom and baby with breastmilk being the primary source of nutrition until one year.\n\nOf course it is fine to choose to do something else and none of this negates the fact that what is what for individual families will vary.", "People say that an animal dying in stress tastes worse, too. Hormones modulate stress and stress modulates/imbalances hormones. They are significantly entwined. If you're a baby, running on instinct, and breast is one or the only thing you've had in your life, then I find it hard to believe that you can't tell the difference.\n\n(Hell, even the flowers the goats ate during the spring vs. summer makes their milk taste different, though that's plant matter. Wep, that's a hillbilly tale for another day.)", "My oldest started teething at 2 months.

She needs to talk to a lactation consultant.", "Same! My daughter is a no-nonsense sort of nurser and can drain my breast in under ten minutes. If I feed her from the right side first (my over producer with a very strong let down) some times she won\u2019t even want the left. And she surpassed her birth weight and then some within the two weeks (she was 8lb 6oz at birth, 7lb 13oz at her 1 week visit and 9lb 1oz at her 2 week visit). What can I say? She\u2019s her father\u2019s daughter - girl loves to eat", "My mom was fully on board the exclusive breast fed train until I cut a couple of teeth. Apparently I chomped down, she screamed, and that was the moment where I got switched to bottle and formula.", "> Wep, that's a hillbilly tale for another day.\n\nIt's actually not. In my country, you can buy milk labeled by what food the cows had.", "When I had a hard time with breastfeeding my husband found me an IBCLC covered by insurance, made the appointment, went with me to the appointment, literally would help me latch the baby, listened to me cry about how I felt like a bad mom and would tell me all the great things I had done for our baby, and would tell me he supports me whatever I wanted to do and constantly ask how he could help me. He filled up my water bottle, handled diaper changes and non hunger related soothing, kept me company, watched YouTube videos on breastfeeding techniques with me, etc.\n\nThere are a lot of ways that he can be helpful other than saying \u201cquit then,\u201d every time she expresses a problem.", "If you must know, the baby has puked up every formula I've tried. There is no other solution than breastmilk.", "It absolutely can hurt sometimes, especially when a baby is teething!", "Rollercoaster of insanity this one.", "And an LC can't solve everything - permanent nerve damage over here from it, huge amounts of cash down the drain to many, many LCs and actual PTSD from BFing. Nightmare all around. Doesn't work for everyone. Worth trying help, but not everything can be fixed.", "That means the latch isn't deep enough. OP needs to talk to an LC. \n\nI still breastfeed my almost two year old. He has lots of teeth. It only hurts when his latch isn't right.", "If the baby is using the mom as a teether, gently smoosh baby\u2019s face into mom\u2019s breast.   Baby will unlatch and stop biting.  A few times of this, and baby will stop using mom as a teether.  \n\nAlso, baby should be offered an appropriate teething item.", "What are the alternatives that are just as good?\n\n1. AAP, WHO, NIH, and virtually every medical organization that there is recommend breastfeeding for the health of mom & baby. \n2. Most women find exclusive pumping to be more exhausting, painful, and difficult to sustain in the long term\n3. Direct nursing has benefits in terms of things like jaw and palette development over bottles whether those bottles are formula or breastmilk.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be best for an individual family to do something other than the official recommendation of EBF.\n\nMoms deserve to be supported in their feeding decisions no matter what those are unless their decision is to starve their baby or something. It doesn\u2019t sound like there is a suggestion from OP\u2019s baby\u2019s doctor that baby is not getting enough food & so I would say that OP deserves to have her feeding goals supported. \n\nJust because something is painful doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t worth doing and OP\u2019s husband should understand this is a goal of hers and try to help her to achieve it not just discourage her every time she hits a road block. \n\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s so much an AH as underinformed about BF"]}
