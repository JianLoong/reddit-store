But as a mom, who struggled to breastfeed and then moved to exclusively pumping (and supplemented with formula) I must remind you, there is no prize for only breastfeeding. If it\u2019s hurting you, if it\u2019s causing you pain, you should give serious thought to pumping. You can absolutely still have closeness with your child while feeding with a bottle, regardless of whether or not the bottle is filled with breastmilk or formula. The boob is not the only way to bond.", "NAH.  You are free to keep trying but your husband is not an AH for suggesting you switch to pumping.", "Funny, I was breastfeeding my 7 week old while reading this and have never been more grateful that babies in my family don't really cut teeth until they're almost one!\n\nFirst of all, babies who are teething tend to cluster feed while going through big milestones and teeth are a big milestone for sure! Not to mention they will breastfeed for comfort too. As long as his diaper output hasn't drastically decreased and he's gaining weight you're producing enough for him. \n\nSecondly, check your local hospitals and see if they have a breastfeeding group you can join, they do weighed feeds to reassure you about his weight gain and will certainly have tips for teething babies. La Leches League is also a group you could look up if your hospital doesn't provide any servies.\n\nNipple shields are helpful, you can also try unlatching your baby every time he bites down and eventually he will learn not to. Stick a pinky into the corner of his mouth to break the seal and it won't be painful to pull him off. Humankind has been breastfeeding for a long time without pumps and formula. Don't feel bad using those tools when you're overwhelmed!! I certainly use them myself. But also don't feel like you have no other option but to suffer through the pain or just stop altogether.\n\nAnd talk to your husband about your communication styles, this sounds like a classic \"I just want to vent\" vs \"I just want to fix it\" situation. A breastfeeding group would likely be a better place to vent most of your frustrations because everyone there has been through it or is going through it, but your husband needs to learn how to listen to be supportive instead of listening to respond. NAH so far but he's close to asshole territory because his advice is neither revolutionary nor helpful.", "It may have already been suggested, but have you tried nipple shields?", "NAH\n\nBabies nurse for comfort, too. So your little one is in pain, and the sucking brings relief. \n\nBabies also go for periods where they nurse all the time depending on growth spurts. \n\nYes, teething kids can bite. \n\nMy kids did not teeth till later that that though. Looking it up teething usually starts between 4-7 months, which tracks with my experience. (My kiddos are grown now) \n\nIf a child bite you the way I was told to handle it was to give a firm no-bite and remove the baby from the breast. Then allow them to latch on again. \n\nBecause he is so young though I would make sure you check with her pediatrician. It might just be a growth spurt coming. (I swear I felt like a 24 hr milk bar on some days) \n\nIt also depends on when he got the hang of it. If he just started really latching effectively, it's gonna hurt for a bit. \nBut eventually that goes away. \n\nI'm sure your doctor told you to count wet diapers and poop diapers to monitor intake. If your baby is pooping and peeing like they should, they are getting enough. \n\nI don't think your husband is an AH either, yet. He sees the woman he loves in pain and to him that pain is unnecessary, since their are other alternatives. \n\nI think you need to have a conversation with him and explain that when you are venting about motherhood, sometimes you just need a hug and some support.", "My youngest started teething at 3 months. Hyland's teething tablets were a lifesaver for me during nursing. The pain from teething interfered with latching on but those were like magic.", "NAH from what you've said. You certainly aren't an AH for wanting to continue breastfeeding. And it seems like your husband is just trying to come up with alternatives so that you aren't in pain from breastfeeding. I just hope he's bringing this up in a respectful and non-demanding way.", "NAH because you should do what feels right for you, and husband\u2019s reaction is coming from a place of concern.\n\nOnly because a few people are jumping in the comments to say breastfeeding is recommended for the first year\u2026 my 2 cents is that it gave me ppd and I didn\u2019t even realize it until I quit (after only 1 month). Felt like myself again the very next day. Quitting breastfeeding made me a better mom personally and my daughter and I are crazy close still (she is 3 now).\n\nEveryone is different! If you really love it, stick with it. Plenty of women do it for a very long time and really enjoy it for the bonding. I think that\u2019s awesome. But your husband is looking out for your best interests & overall well-being. Maybe hear him out too? You will be just as good of a mom if you formula feed and baby will be just as healthy.

Parenting is hard enough!\n\nWhatever you decide, you\u2019re definitely not the asshole.", "NAH. \n\nBreastfeeding is hard for everyone involved including dad's, they want to fix issues and be involved too. He sees you struggling and knows there's a quick fix answer which seems perfectly logical to him, you seem illogical because you won't accept his 'help' \n\nYou want to continue which is obviously your choice. It's fantastic you kept going after your rocky start and you're a complete star for moving to exclusively breastfeed that's a freaking hard turn around!! \n\nCluster feeding when feeling icky isn't unusual for baby, it's a comfort thing as much as a feeding thing for baby :) \n\nIf you are worried about supply,. pumping can help reassure you your output is good as of course you can see it, it will also potentially help improve your supply if done correctly. \n\nDirty/wet nappies and weight gain are always the best indicator of getting enough, there's no set tim baby will feed. Some will feed for 20 mins and go 5 hours others will feed for 45 mins and do just a few hours. \n\nAlso have a look in your local area for breastfeeding support groups/cafes etc as they may be able to offer you advice on latch etc as it shouldn't be painful to feed and they may also be able to help with your concerns and understand the need to vent.\n\nUltimately remember to give both yourself and your husband grace, its a massive adjustment for you both mentally and physically xx", "No one is the asshole\n\nYou both just have to communicate and compromise. I don't think that there is something wrong with wanting to breastfeed but you should be careful. You said that it hurts sometimes, be mindful and cautious of that. Your baby might cause irritation or worse an infection if he bites an open wound. But I also understand the closeness you want with your baby. \n\nYour husband is just doing what a husband should be doing, caring and being concerned about his wife. If you don't want to stop breastfeeding, then I guess he can't stop you but just know that he is worried.", "Maybe switch to both? Have the first/last feed be breast then pump in between to give yourself a break but still have a closeness if nothing else works\n\nEither way NTA but dont be upset at your husband. He might not understand how close it may be for you and just wants to make sure youre okay. It can also seem \u201cstupid\u201d to him because he may not understand you enjoy it so much.

As soon as his nose is covered he'll pop off. Its a gentle way to enforce that biting = no boob. Generally only have to do this a couple times before they figure it out.   \n If you're having pain cause his latch isn't great cause of the teething gently stroke the nose and chin away from the breast when he's latched and that will help him settle into a better latch which should lessen the pain.   \nI used to be a breastfeeding counselor - nursing isn't just about food.

NAH", "Jumping here with advice(s) & problems i had\n\n- For boobs fast refill - hot chicken soup (eat the meat too) with too many vegetables (all kind of). Hot  as you can whithout burning yourself. It inflates the boobs better than any other hot liquid or warm/cold [[not worm]] drink, including those specifically made for stimulating the lactating.\n\n- If your boobs bleed after baby bites you there are baby safe creams (ointments) to use.\nMy oldest was chewing my boobs and i know that pain. It's like using scisors to cut your nippl.\n\nIt might be because: baby's teeth grow (mine already had 2 at birth), baby doesn't know how to catch and keep the nipple (so baby closes his gums on you to prevent running food), your nipple hasn't formed yet  - like at the bottle, so baby catches something and doesn't release (this is where you can form the button by rotating it - or your SO \ud83d\ude09 and around here some dr advice during pregnancy to do so)\n\n- the more the baby latches, the more milk would be produced by your body - milk production is based on demand/offer.\n\nThe feeding should take around 40 minutes now (at 2 months)??? Don't remember exactly the duration of the meal, but there should have been some infos on the docs from the discharge (and you can ask the ped). If baby falls asleep after 5-10-15 minutes you can gently touch/tickle under nose, his jaw so that baby wakes up and start to eat.\n\n- After breastfeeding, eat some hot chicken soup (you will be starving) - and go to sleep as much as you can\n\n- Formula is the alternative. It helps if you don't have enough milk, to complete the meal.\n\nIt also helps in case you must go somewhere. With my second baby, born in Covid hospital, with me positive covid and baby negative, i knew i won't be seeing my baby until after the 2 weeks.\n\nSo baby was fed with formula because they didn't let anyone before me to send milk for the baby.\n\nI tried to stop or slow down the proces (for colostrum) and managed for 1 week. After that the milk started to come and i started pumping and arguing with the nurses (doctors said it was safe, the Health Department said it was safe and they have to do it) because they didn't wanted to give my milk to my baby. There were some hush hush things and everyone started happily taking the milk.\n\nThe problem was they started asking for more, but i wasn't able to do more because:\n\n- there wasn't enough food = no meat, no vegetables in the tastless watery \"soup\", plain rice (that's 4 lunch), 1 rice budding 4 evening = same rice from lunch, burned (black burned) & with a sprinkle of sugar. As 4 breakfast 2 slices of bread, 1 small glass (100-150 ml) of tea/yogurt, 1 slice of cheese (like in the mac for kids), 1 spoon of jam. I was starving. [well, they were stealing the food, everything you received was in so small servings ] \n\nSo as you can imagine, i needed to have more milk when i got out of the hospital. \n\nBaby refused formula after having my milk. Also, baby refused formula when i had to fight 2 months against an infection (from the hospital) and refused even when i went with the oldest for 2 weeks for a surgery for her. \n\nSo if your baby wants the formula, as extra or full meal, use it.

Really make sure he has your whole aereola in his mouth, not the tip. \n\nIf you begin to supplement formula, it may erode into your supply because it will fill him up more than breast milk and it is easier to drink from a bottle so some babies will prefer it.
