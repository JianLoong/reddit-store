But as a mom, who struggled to breastfeed and then moved to exclusively pumping (and supplemented with formula) I must remind you, there is no prize for only breastfeeding. If it\u2019s hurting you, if it\u2019s causing you pain, you should give serious thought to pumping. You can absolutely still have closeness with your child while feeding with a bottle, regardless of whether or not the bottle is filled with breastmilk or formula. The boob is not the only way to bond.", "NAH.  You are free to keep trying but your husband is not an AH for suggesting you switch to pumping.", "Funny, I was breastfeeding my 7 week old while reading this and have never been more grateful that babies in my family don't really cut teeth until they're almost one!\n\nFirst of all, babies who are teething tend to cluster feed while going through big milestones and teeth are a big milestone for sure! Not to mention they will breastfeed for comfort too. As long as his diaper output hasn't drastically decreased and he's gaining weight you're producing enough for him. \n\nSecondly, check your local hospitals and see if they have a breastfeeding group you can join, they do weighed feeds to reassure you about his weight gain and will certainly have tips for teething babies. La Leches League is also a group you could look up if your hospital doesn't provide any servies.\n\nNipple shields are helpful, you can also try unlatching your baby every time he bites down and eventually he will learn not to. Stick a pinky into the corner of his mouth to break the seal and it won't be painful to pull him off. Humankind has been breastfeeding for a long time without pumps and formula. Don't feel bad using those tools when you're overwhelmed!! I certainly use them myself. But also don't feel like you have no other option but to suffer through the pain or just stop altogether.\n\nAnd talk to your husband about your communication styles, this sounds like a classic \"I just want to vent\" vs \"I just want to fix it\" situation. A breastfeeding group would likely be a better place to vent most of your frustrations because everyone there has been through it or is going through it, but your husband needs to learn how to listen to be supportive instead of listening to respond. NAH so far but he's close to asshole territory because his advice is neither revolutionary nor helpful.", "It may have already been suggested, but have you tried nipple shields?", "NAH\n\nBabies nurse for comfort, too. So your little one is in pain, and the sucking brings relief. \n\nBabies also go for periods where they nurse all the time depending on growth spurts. \n\nYes, teething kids can bite. \n\nMy kids did not teeth till later that that though. Looking it up teething usually starts between 4-7 months, which tracks with my experience. (My kiddos are grown now) \n\nIf a child bite you the way I was told to handle it was to give a firm no-bite and remove the baby from the breast. Then allow them to latch on again. \n\nBecause he is so young though I would make sure you check with her pediatrician. It might just be a growth spurt coming. (I swear I felt like a 24 hr milk bar on some days) \n\nIt also depends on when he got the hang of it. If he just started really latching effectively, it's gonna hurt for a bit. \nBut eventually that goes away. \n\nI'm sure your doctor told you to count wet diapers and poop diapers to monitor intake. If your baby is pooping and peeing like they should, they are getting enough. \n\nI don't think your husband is an AH either, yet. He sees the woman he loves in pain and to him that pain is unnecessary, since their are other alternatives. \n\nI think you need to have a conversation with him and explain that when you are venting about motherhood, sometimes you just need a hug and some support.", "My youngest started teething at 3 months. Hyland's teething tablets were a lifesaver for me during nursing. The pain from teething interfered with latching on but those were like magic.", "NAH from what you've said. You certainly aren't an AH for wanting to continue breastfeeding. And it seems like your husband is just trying to come up with alternatives so that you aren't in pain from breastfeeding. I just hope he's bringing this up in a respectful and non-demanding way.", "NAH because you should do what feels right for you, and husband\u2019s reaction is coming from a place of concern.\n\nOnly because a few people are jumping in the comments to say breastfeeding is recommended for the first year\u2026 my 2 cents is that it gave me ppd and I didn\u2019t even realize it until I quit (after only 1 month). Felt like myself again the very next day. Quitting breastfeeding made me a better mom personally and my daughter and I are crazy close still (she is 3 now).\n\nEveryone is different! If you really love it, stick with it. Plenty of women do it for a very long time and really enjoy it for the bonding. I think that\u2019s awesome. But your husband is looking out for your best interests & overall well-being. Maybe hear him out too? You will be just as good of a mom if you formula feed and baby will be just as healthy. Whatever doesn\u2019t create resentment for you or make your life harder is the thing you should do. Parenting is hard enough!\n\nWhatever you decide, you\u2019re definitely not the asshole.", "NAH. \n\nBreastfeeding is hard for everyone involved including dad's, they want to fix issues and be involved too. He sees you struggling and knows there's a quick fix answer which seems perfectly logical to him, you seem illogical because you won't accept his 'help' \n\nYou want to continue which is obviously your choice. It's fantastic you kept going after your rocky start and you're a complete star for moving to exclusively breastfeed that's a freaking hard turn around!! \n\nCluster feeding when feeling icky isn't unusual for baby, it's a comfort thing as much as a feeding thing for baby :) \n\nIf you are worried about supply,. pumping can help reassure you your output is good as of course you can see it, it will also potentially help improve your supply if done correctly. \n\nDirty/wet nappies and weight gain are always the best indicator of getting enough, there's no set tim baby will feed. Some will feed for 20 mins and go 5 hours others will feed for 45 mins and do just a few hours. \n\nAlso have a look in your local area for breastfeeding support groups/cafes etc as they may be able to offer you advice on latch etc as it shouldn't be painful to feed and they may also be able to help with your concerns and understand the need to vent.\n\nUltimately remember to give both yourself and your husband grace, its a massive adjustment for you both mentally and physically xx", "No one is the asshole\n\nYou both just have to communicate and compromise. I don't think that there is something wrong with wanting to breastfeed but you should be careful. You said that it hurts sometimes, be mindful and cautious of that. Your baby might cause irritation or worse an infection if he bites an open wound. But I also understand the closeness you want with your baby. \n\nYour husband is just doing what a husband should be doing, caring and being concerned about his wife. If you don't want to stop breastfeeding, then I guess he can't stop you but just know that he is worried.", "Maybe switch to both? Have the first/last feed be breast then pump in between to give yourself a break but still have a closeness if nothing else works\n\nEither way NTA but dont be upset at your husband. He might not understand how close it may be for you and just wants to make sure youre okay. It can also seem \u201cstupid\u201d to him because he may not understand you enjoy it so much.

The baby is still an infant.", "What the heck? Both things can be true? That is like telling someone never to work out again because they said it was hard and tired them out and then they were sore. All of that can be true but it\u2019s still worth doing. She should do what she wants to do but breastfeeding is a lot of work and it\u2019s nice for someone to appreciate it. If the husband is feeling excluded he should say so with words and not manipulation through lack of support and discouragement.", "Yeah, I agree! Taking care of a baby is hard!! \n\nTry to take a date night soon. \ud83d\ude0a", "The baby is two months old.", "The baby is fucking two months old, dude. They don't know what they're doing!", "Babies can bite when very young, but it is strongly recommended to breast feed for at least the first year. I\u2019m not so sure of your advice.", "Teething is easier on babies if they continue nursing through it.", "It is better for the baby to nurse. There are other options to manage pain while still nursing. Maybe instead of just saying to quit, the husband could help OP look into some of those.", "She wants support, not just the same solutions. Sometimes you just want to vent.", "He does not actually have equal say in all baby matters. If he wants the baby breastfed, and she does not, he doesn't get to choose that.", "There are other things to do than just pump. Maybe her husband should do research before suggesting something. Like nipple shields help. There are more options to help.", "Pumping isn\u2019t an indicator of supply. A large percentage of women don\u2019t respond well to the pump and can\u2019t pump out as much as baby would get out while nursing. Babies are way more efficient at emptying the breast than a pump is and the body will regulate supply to baby\u2019s demand as they nurse.", "NO. The rice-in-the-bottle thing is an outdated suggestion that has been proven to be VERY unsafe for babies that young.", "Op, please do not take the suggestion regarding baby rice. That is absolutely not safe for a young infant (less than two months old per op).", "Babies can be born with teeth. It's rare but it happens. 2 months is early but not even close to impossible.", "My middle child got her first tooth break through at 4 months and the doctors were shocked it was so early. I have heard of babies being born with teeth, but my understanding is that it is more of a birth defect and tend to be more of a problem. I have never heard of a baby having teeth break thru at 2 months.", "OP is just as capable, if not more since she\u2019s the one actually breastfeeding, of finding a solution to the problem.", "neither party seems to be doing that to be fair", "Seconded - though I had so much milk it was embarrassing.\nUnlatch, say something like \"Mummy is not a chew toy\", then try again.", "Also google a technique where you press the baby closer to your chest, there is something about that movement that stops the bitting.", "The baby is growing up. That's what happens when time passes.\n\nThe way the issues was framed was that:\n\nBaby nursing = pain.\n\nHusband showed concern.\n\nSaid, maybe don't nurse.\n\nResponse. \n\n\"no, it means to much to me\"", "That's why I didn't judge her as the butthole. All I'm saying is if she's getting THAT reaction from her husband and she's worried that she's being a butthole then it's better to just not complain about it if she enjoys the act anyway as there's nothing wrong with continuing to do the breastfeeding. I don't think the husband feels being excluded anyway, as I genuinely think that he's just offering a solution to the wife's perceived problems.", "[removed]", "Thank you.", "Yes but that doesn't change the fact that the husband isn't being supportive of her breastfeeding and is instead encouraging her to quit, which is especially disheartening to hear when you're sacrificing things to breastfeed.", "There's a certain point when you have to put your own comfort above another.\n\nIn this instance, it appears, the wife is doing the opposite.\n\nWhat she's doing. She's literally being physically hurt but it's prioritizing the \"bond\" of breast feeding over her own comfort. \n\nYou should prioritize your child, but there should be a limit. \n\nAs posted, she's putting herself past that limit for the sake of \"her child\". \n\nWe need some self care, as things are presented. She's neglecting her own self care", "I'm gonna add a note here from my own experience.\n\nMy ex had BPD and I strongly suspect, narcissism.\n\nWhen our daughter was born she switched her focus on her \"image\" to what she thought of other's image of her being a mother.\n\nOur daughter wouldn't latch at first.\n\nThat made her failure as a mother.\n\nShe worked so hard to get that. For her to be natural and not use formula.\n\nBecause if she didn't, she was a failure. Because of what she thought others thought of her.\n\nThere may be some other stronger issues at play", "Lmao ok. Expecting a partner to be supportive of goals = slavery. That's definitely how marriage works.", "I don't know about that. Nobody likes seeing their partner in pain so it makes sense that's he trying to suggest different solutions other than breastfeeding if she's venting about it often. It's likely that he doesn't know about the other options that are breastfeeding friendly."]}
