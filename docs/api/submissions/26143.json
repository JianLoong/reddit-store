My older brother has been seeing his girlfriend for a few months.

I'm the only one in my family that my brother is comfortable introducing me to his new girlfriends because I don't judge, so I did keep my thoughts to myself. I got to know her a little better through the months and those thoughts never really changed. \n\nFriday I got a text from her asking if we could talk. I wasn't quite sure what to expect in this talk, but I said sure. That evening she come over and said my brother was upset with her but wouldn't tell her why. I asked what had happened up to the moment he got upset with her. She told me that she told him she was pregnant and that's when he got upset and shut down. He refused to talk to her and told her to leave. This is where I could be the ah. My Exact words were, \"he's upset because you either cheated or you're not pregnant, because my brother can't have kids. He was tested when his ex wife and him tried having kids and it is him who is infertile.\" She looked like a deer caught in headlights. She denied that she cheated or is lying about it. I just said \"ok, well that's most likely why he's upset. Expect a paternity test when you have the baby. Congratulations by the way.\" \n\nAfter she left she text me that I'm a b word and that my brother should have been the one to tell her that information at the beginning of their relationship, not me. I told her that it was her who asked me a question and I answered it honestly. My brother confirmed with her, and then me, that is exactly why he's upset. She still claims she didn't cheat and she's not lying. \n\nMy family is mostly on my side, except my sister. My sister said that it could still be my brother's and I'm an ah for basically calling her a liar. Then she added that I shouldn't be giving out my brother's health information without his consent. I did ask my brother if he was upset with me for ripping that bandaid and telling his gf his health info, but he says he's not mad at me and that me telling her helped him. He said he couldn't tell her himself because of how hurt he is that she either cheated or is lying. He 100% cannot have children, so if she's pregnant then it's not his kid. \n\nAm I the AH for telling my brother's gf she's a liar?", "created_utc": 1693765070, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16942m2/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_gf_shes_lying/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m over the moon excited and drive to his friends house, who he is helping to move, and I tell him the news immediately with the proudest smile on my face. His face drops and he asks me if it\u2019s his kid. I\u2019m devastated by his response. How could he think this of me? It was a fair question, though, and I understood his perspective. It still hurts to think back on (which is more than I like to admit) and we have been married 13 years now. Our daughter is very much his and they look the most alike. \n\nIs this a miracle baby? Maybe. Did she cheat? Maybe. Have your brother get a DNA test asap.", "NTA. You told the truth, and frankly I wish we had a picture of her face when it happened.", "NTA. However, I wonder why your brother never disclosed that to her himself. I know it's a personal and unpleasant thing to share, but if I get into a relationship with someone, it means I potentially see them as the person I'd want to have a family with in the future, and therefore it would be super important for me to know this early on so as not to waste valuable time and before I've gotten too attached to them, otherwise if a couple of years go by and he proposes to me and I accept, then he tells me he can't have kids, I'd be pretty livid. Not everyone wants to adopt either.", "NTA, you told her the truth. Has your brother found out the truth yet?", "NTA. She's just trying to cause drama. Why would she even talk to you about this if she wasn't trying to drive a wedge between your brother and the rest of his family?

We can\u2019t all be told things to help our delicate dispositions. She asked the question and got the answer. If I got pregnant and heard this news I\u2019d say I know I didn\u2019t cheat so I look forward to proving that.

If I were you, I probably would have asked her so many questions with the most excitement on my face while delivering congratulatory speeches. Next I would have mentioned the extravagant baby shower I would help her plan only to tell her she was either cheating or lying! Petty, but she is obviously not the person for your brother and is upset she got CAUGHT!", "YTA:  Well you didn't call her a liar but you did basically say she either cheated or she's lying with nothing in between.  Now the issue here is what if this is a miracle baby. Happens all the time and if it happened here your brother now may have to fight to be around the child he thought he couldn't have", "NTA!

You accused her of lying or cheating, and you are being pedantic by saying you didn't accuse her of lying. There is still a chance that she is pregnant with your brother's child and if so you probably effed up their relationship and your relationship with the mother of your niece or nephew. Infertile does not mean sterile and his ex could have had contributing factors that weren't the main issue, but someone without them would have a higher percentage chance of getting pregnant.

If you want to you could respond to the her saying you weren\u2019t trying to accuse her of anything and you weren\u2019t trying to be harsh, you were just explaining the situation like she asked. That way if it\u2019s a miracle and she is pregnant you can try to mend the relationship and if she is a liar or a cheater then she has no one but herself to be mad at. And to the people saying your brother should have told her right away I don\u2019t think it was wrong of him to wait for the right time to discuss something that\u2019s so painful for him.", "I will have to ask him the exact wording used. I just remember that was a major factor when his ex wife and him divorced. She take wanted kids and he couldn't have them.", "Her words according to her is \"you either cheated or you're not pregnant.\" So yeah she did tell her she was either a cheater or she lied. Saying she didn't tell her she was lying because she didn't use the word lie is being pedantic.", "[removed]", "They've been together just about 4 months. I do agree that is something he should have told her himself in the beginning. \n\nI have my tubes tied and I went on two dates with a really good guy. The first date we actually discussed him not having children yet and how I'm not having anymore. Second date I realized I needed to cut the cord, because this guy is younger and wanted kids, but seemed to still want to date me. I didn't want to waste our time on anymore dates since I can't give him something he'll eventually want.", "They stated that they had only been dating a few months. That would be a conversation if it was getting serious, they might not have been there yet.\n\nEdited to change a word", "Found the AH", "I asked him today if he was alright and he said he would call me later.", "I'd say her baby trap is going to blow up in her face.", "I will update after I talk to him later today.

I wish my brother could have kids. He would be a good dad.", "If it happens all the time, not really a miracle then is it", "This is exactly why I thought I might be the ah here, because I cut straight to the point and didn't soften the landing.  \n\nIn all honesty, I wish my brother could have kids and if it's his and it really is a miracle baby, I'm willing to kiss major ass to be close to this baby.", "God forbid people hate cheaters. Lol you always have the most garbage takes in this subreddit", "Just keep in mind, infertile =/= sterile. So if he is \"infertile,\" there is still a chance the baby is his.", "Because his marriage fell apart on the bases that he couldn't have kids, he probably went through a lot emotionally, so even though you could have worded it differently I'm going with NTA.\n\nShe might not have cheated, but that is very rationally the first thought that both you and your brother would jump too. \n\nHis gf should understand this.", "We had to do IVF to have a child and what we found was that our odds were very very low. Like they wouldn\u2019t say we were infertile but said we had about a 5% chance of getting pregnant over five years with perfectly timed sex. It just really really wasn\u2019t likely. It\u2019s possible your brother is in the same situation. It COULD happen, it\u2019s just the odds are really low. \n\nThat being said, OP, you were asked a question and you answered it. You didn\u2019t know that she didn\u2019t know about the diagnosis. She is taking it very personally. IF it\u2019s your brother\u2019s and she didn\u2019t cheat she would feel like everyone is seeing her as some sort of loose woman and a cheater. That would really hurt, especially since she may have been really excited to tell him, and may have imagined this as one of the great moments of her life (assuming she wants kids).  For your brother, he has gone through all of the struggles that come with dealing with infertility and coming to terms with Never having kids. So honestly, no one sucks here. \n\nThough I would suggest the brother not wait so long to tell someone, because if someone wants kids and it\u2019s not a possibility with him, that\u2019s a hard conversation that\u2019s needs to happen.", "Yet you took the time to read and comment? \ud83d\ude02", "Found the troll", "See, that's the right way to go about it.", "They were clearly having sex already, and a few months is already quite a bit of time to have this kind of conversation and they're not that young either to not care about that topic yet (given the brother's been married and divorced). It's not just 2 or 3 dates. When was he even planning to tell her? 2 days later? I doubt it.\n\nMe personally, if I'm having sex with someone, it's already serious, at least for me. I don't do casual sex, but I guess not everyone operates the same way.", "You're like a wart on my AH.", "I believe so. I've never posted here either. :)", "GF's reaction says a lot though. Her reaction wasn't shock followed by relief- \"Im hurt that he thinks i cheated,, but i see why.. This will be so easy to fix, we will get a DNA test\". Instead it was \"He should have told me\". Why? So she couldn't claim someone else's kid was his?\n\nShe still might be telling the truth, but her reaction is off to me.", "You can try but just know that may still mean nothing. With all the ass kissing in the world she is not going to forget this", "I\u2019m guessing you were in shock. You knew she hurt your brother, you made the same assumption he did, and if her reaction is as you described, she knew she was caught.", "You're a good sibling, you have your brothers back and didn't sugar coat it, also willing to do what ever you need to if you are wrong.", "> because I cut straight to the point and didn't soften the landing. \n\nNo, you made factually unsupported statements, was the problem.", "Thank you. I have no idea who you are or the quality of your takes and I am happy that way. You are insignificant and what you think means less than nothing to me.", "Still nothing wrong with what op said. That's why the bro is upset. Op didn't directly accuse of anything just explained why the bro would be bothered by it. If you haven't been cheating that legit gives you a direct answer to why they are doubting you. You can then ask this shit and work it out and explain the difference. \n\nObviously if yo ass been cheating then this news guna be a way bigger deal than having something you can directly address and get someone to understand the difference in.", "When he calls me later I'll ask him which word was used when he found this info out. I may be the one messing up with the wording and if not, then I'll let him know the difference in the words and for him to contact his doctor.", "I dated my husband casually, having sex, without talking about settling down. \nAnd when he proposed I was drunk and he had to ask again the next day. I even asked my mother if I had said yes. It was less than a year of dating. We started baby talks before signing paperwork, but people can have sex casually without asking for anything serious. Not recommended, use protections, but it happens", "Psst\u2026 people don\u2019t have sex solely for reproduction", "I felt the same way with her reaction, but I also know I was \"to the point\", so I was giving the benefit of the doubt. \n\nPlus, she said she didn't know why he was upset and that's why she asked me, but when I asked what happened leading up to him getting upset, it wasn't a puzzle. She went to his house, when they were having dinner she told him she was pregnant, he got upset and asked her to leave. How did she not know what made him upset to where she had to come to me to ask?", "She should be understanding under the circumstances. I know if it was me and I found out I was pregnant and the father was told he couldn't have children, would I be hurt at first? Yes I would but I would also understand why he thought I cheated and I wouldn't hesitate to get a dna test to prove it's his baby to ease everyone's mind. I'm petty but I'm not unrealistic.", "Who cares? Quite frankly she was wrong to drag OP into this. She invited an outside opinion. You get what you get. NTA", "What do you mean factually unsupported statements? She said that her brother is infertile and was tested by a doctor. You can\u2019t get more support about a medical condition existing if it was diagnosed by a doctor", "Yes, does happen. That's why I said not everyone operates the same way as I do. However, it sounds like neither you nor your husband had any infertility issues to disclose anyway so that wasn't a discussion that you needed to have early on, casual sex or not.", "Do you know how to read?\n\n\"but I guess not everyone operates the same way\".\n\nWhat do you think this means?\n\nNo, sex isn't just for reproducing and each time you have sex, it doesn't mean you're wanting to start a family then and there, even if you are in a serious relationship. However, sometime in the future you (not you literally, I mean the general person) will likely want to, and what good does it do if the person you want to have kids with can't have kids yet doesn't tell you early on, even if you're not looking to have kids YET?", "Going under the assumption that she didn't cheat maybe she was hoping that your brother wasn't a dick who would get mad and kick her out because she was pregnant? There are enough deadbeats out there that will cut and run in that situation that it would be a fair assumption, and she would be giving him a lot of credit asking if there was some other reason.", "Depends on why he was diagnosed as infertile. One diagnosis is this:\n\n>A lower than normal sperm count (fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen or a total sperm count of less than 39 million per ejaculate)\n\nAs well as low motility count (poor swimmers)\n\nThere is a small chance that with either of these he can still get someone pregnant."]}
