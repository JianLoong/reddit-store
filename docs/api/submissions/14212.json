We went to a campground that allows alcohol and has a natural spring. We brought a lot of beer, liquor and hard cider. We drank a lot at our campsite and generally unwound from the work week. After that, we went swimming.\n\nMy cousin's girlfriend tried to stop up from going swimming. She said it wasn't safe to swim while drunk. We assured her that we had done so before and were aware that it was riskier than swimming sober. We told her she didn't have to come. She did come and stood by the side the entire time, yelling at us to get out of the water. It was incredibly obnoxious and somewhat dampened the party atmosphere.\n\nWhen the camping trip was over and we were headed back my sister snapped at her \"in case it isn't obvious, you're never invited to come on a family trip again, ever.\" Cousin's girlfriend got really upset. She said she was scared that something would happen to us, that we would die. I told her that would have been our responsibility, not hers, and she can't control what other people do.\n\nMy sister added that driving to and from the campsite on the country's deadliest highway was the most dangerous thing we did all weekend, but she didn't say a word about that, she just wanted to feel morally superior. I cut her off and said we just all have different beliefs and it's fine, so we shouldn't vacation together. Cousin's girlfriend has since reached out to me and tried to make me understand her point of view. I said it's water under the bridge, but she wants me to see her point of view. She said she had a moral obligation to prevent us from drinking and swimming. I said she didn't and I don't want to talk about it anymore.\n\nThings ended up getting heated, and she said she should have known better than to expect more from white trash assholes.

How drunk are we talking? How deep is this natural spring? Were you all generally within the same area or was the spring fairly large(ie would it have been possible for someone to go out of sight and drown without anyone noticing)? Sounds like it was at night, was there additional lighting so you all would be able to see if someone was drowning? Was anybody sober/not drunk so they could potentially save someone from drowning? \n\nBasically just trying to gauge how safe/unsafe this activity was, because I think that is relevant to gauge whether cousin\u2019s GF\u2019s reaction was appropriate.", "Idk everyone kind of seems annoying here\u2026", "ESH", "ESH. The cousin's gf was right. Swimming while drunk is dangerous and stupid. However,  after pointing that out to the group of idiots, she should have let it go. I agree, though, you all shouldn't travel together. You guys sound obnoxious, and if this was a public campground,  you probably annoyed all the campers around you because drunk people tend to be loud AF.", "YTA. She wasn\u2019t acting \u201cmorally superior\u201d and this wasn\u2019t about beliefs. It doesn\u2019t sound like she didn\u2019t want you to get drunk, it sounds like she was concerned that swimming while shitfaced is dangerous. You\u2019re the one who acted like it\u2019s about \u201cbeliefs.\u201d I veer a little towards E S H due to her not just walking away after you chose to be completely dismissive of the very real risk and the \u201cwhite trash assholes\u201d comment, but the latter was after she\u2019d apparently been berated repeatedly. Fear that you all could die (and it\u2019s very dangerous to swim when trashed - gasp reflex is slowed, orientation is impaired, and so on) is not the same as acting morally superior. And no, it doesn\u2019t much sound like you tried to get along with her at all.\n\nYou probably just ruined either a) your cousin\u2019s relationship with his girlfriend or b) your relationship with your cousin. Either way, grow up, dude.", "ESH\n\nHer - for cursing at you and calling you what she did. That was really uncalled for.\n\nYou all guys - for frankly being dumb. She is completely right, swimming while drunk is very much not a safe practice.", "YTA for how you dealt with it. \n\nThe title is misleading too and should read \"AITA for how I treated my cousins gf\" (side note, most misleading titles tend to have AH writing them)\n\nShe wasn't wrong. It'll be all fun and games until someone actually drowns.... you blew it off because nothing happened or has happened, but you know what kills people? Complacency. \n\nIf she was \"morally superior,\" she probably would have nagged about everything, including the \"most dangerous highway\"... You have all had fun in the past and want to keep it going for as many years as possible, I get it, but it still doesn't mean you get to be an AH", "YTA. You were admittedly drunk and she was sober. She was the much better judge of your ability to swim in your condition. And your attitude that one of you dying would be none of her concern speaks volumes about what a PITA you and your sister were, if that\u2019s what you think even when sober. You should have apologized for stressing her out with your drunken antics, not doubled down.

If your drinking is impeding other peoples safety/comfortability, it\u2019s a problem. I had a friend do this very same thing and he hit his head. I\u2019m glad people cared about your safety.", "YTA. It's not just your risk. Drunk swimmers put everyone around them at risk as well.\n\nYou and all your drunk idiot friends and family need to realize that if you're drowning, people are going to try to save you.

While the campground allowed alcohol I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t want rowdy drunk people doing dangerous things.

It is incredibly dangerous to swim while drunk, especially since I'm assuming nighttime. If someone died and she didn't at least try to save them, who gets in trouble and has to live with that? Who's family is going to blame the sober person? Oh wait, I know! Just because it didn't happen this time won't mean it won't happen the next. She was literally looking out for your lives, and you decided she wanted to be morally superior ? What she said was wrong, and I won't condone that, but that also doesn't mean you were right.", "NTA, for the question asked.\n\nI think most of us can agree it\u2019s not too intelligent to get intoxicated and enter an unpredictable body of water. I would say YTA for potentially putting other people in danger, but that\u2019s not what was asked.\n\nIt sounds like she went way overboard trying to stop adults from doing something they were going to do. Anything other than \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t do this\u201d is overkill. Standing by the side telling you to get out, and still talking about it days later is insane.", "NTA in the moment ig you could give her a pass for how she acted but she still acted the same way days later. At a certain point it goes from caring about your safety to wanting to be morally superior. I would just advise making it crystal clear to your cousin as to why she isnt welcomed.", "NTA, different strokes and all.", "NTA - There isn't some universal, absolute prohibition on combining alcohol with swimming. Adults judge the risk/reward calculus for themselves and make a decision that works for them-- without forcing anyone else to go along with it.", "NTA. \nYou tried to talk through it with her?

But it seems cousin's gf needs bit of tape over her mouth.", "YTA\n\nShe was right, being drunk and swimming without a sober person keeping watch will go right plenty of times, until it doesn't.\n\nETA: and you or one of your adult friends having an accident does impact more than just you drunk people.\n\nOther groups will have to deal with the fallout of a corpse being dragged out, in the group itself people will jabe to deal with guilt.\n\nAnd emergency services will have to deal with your stupid shit as well instead of being able to assist in proper emergencies.\n\n\nYeah definitely YTA", "NTA - She's on some moral high horse, or maybe the spectrum, either way, her actions were kinda nuts.    \n     \nI don't understand what she needed from you at the end but her calling you all white trash when she didn't get whatever it was shows how she's likely viewed y'all all along.     \n     \nYou went camping, drinking, and swimming.  Big deal.  Young people be young people all the time and this is just what young people do.     \n      \nAnyone that says they have a moral obligation over petty stuff is not someone you generally want to spend much time around.", "NTA.

She dug her own grave, and deserved everything said to her. I've had vacations like this before, where that one friend of a friend is not vibing with everyone else, it sucks.", "NTA.\n\nSo she decided to play \"morality police\" around a bunch of adults who were on vacation, then got angry that nobody wants her around. Shocking.", "Title is misleading. I don't think anyone had a problem with you being drunk. \n\nIn any case - if the spring is relatively benign - like no current or major hazards - I would say your cousin's girlfriend should have let it go.

Not even a little higher, it\u2019s massively higher. According to studies, alcohol is the leading factor in the majority of adult drowning death with at least 70% of adult drowning victims having alcohol in their system. The higher your BAC, the higher the likelihood of drowning. \n\nAs a 911 operator in an area with heavy aquatic activity, I deal with adult drownings pretty much every single day in the summer season. Some days we have multiple drownings. The vast majority of drowning adults are drunk or on drugs. Any adult drowning I\u2019ve worked where the drowned victim was sober was an absolute freak accident, for example a swimmer getting run over by a jet ski (but the jet ski driver was DUI and speeding in a no wake zone.) Alcohol is involved in basically every aquatic call we take. Even if it\u2019s a missing or drowned kid call, the parent is typically drunk! \n\nIf you made the choice to drink and swim, it\u2019s true that you have to deal with the guilt of that if something goes wrong, but you\u2019re also responsible for the trauma you force onto other people by your bad decision making. From the witnesses, the survivors in your group, the 911 operator, the on scene responders\u2026 you\u2019re forcing all of them into this situation because of your shitty choice. \n\nIts one thing to have *one* beer and enjoy the day, it\u2019s another to be drunk and making poor choices.", "ESH.

Drunk people underestimate dangers, and overestimate their own critical thinking.", "NTA. Drinking and swimming is risky but it was your risk to take. I think if someone were blitzed out of their mind I would understand taking action to stop the person from swimming, or getting buzzed a operating a moter vehicle would justify inter vention. What you did wasn't smart, bit that doesn't make you assholes.", "Agreed, I think it depends on how much the group had to drink as well as the depth of the water, distance from shore, etc. \n\nI pictured calmer water not far from shore and a group of people that\u2019s been drinking but not falling-down drunk, but not sure if I\u2019m just giving OP benefit of the doubt. \n\nRegardless, cousins gf wasn\u2019t invited to babysit or lifeguard, she said her piece and the group made their own decision.

( you really shouldn\u2019t be in the water at all if you are drunk but I\u2019m not going to fight people on wading)\n\nYour reaction times are slower, your coordination is off (which is kinda key in the whole swimming thing) all it takes is for someone to accidentally take a breath too early or gulp some of the water, and panic. \n\nIt is so incredibly dangerous. \n\nIf no one their is lifeguard certified and sober, the ability of someone to help a drunk drowning person, without drowning themselves, is extremely low. \n\nThere is also dry drowning.", "The OP answered some of this in a comment, the water was over their heads but it was still daylight out and there were other groups of people around.", "I feel like when you don't really know people, you can express a concern once, then you have to let it go. \n\nShe chose to continue to berate these adults.

It was indeed dumb AF.", "Drunk people have drowned in 5-10cm water.", "Wait, you were swimming buzzed but with a group, around others, in water without a current, while it was light out?

Sounds like a pretty massive overreaction from cousin\u2019s GF. You were all clumped together. The sun was still out and there were several people who would be able to identify if something bad was happening/going to happen. Sounds like most of the group was not blackout/time warping drunk. I don\u2019t see this as a super high risk situation, her reaction was not warranted. A snarky comment about how you all were being stupid would definitely have been warranted. Certainly calling you white trash was uncalled for.\n\nTo your last point, level of danger absolutely matters. If you all were piss drunk and this was at night with no lights around, I definitely would have gone the opposite way. Being adults with your own free will doesn\u2019t mean people shouldn\u2019t attempt to stop you from doing something incredibly dangerous. I just don\u2019t see this particular situation as incredibly dangerous.", "With this context you\u2019re definitely NTA.\n\nWas there risk involved with your decision?

Even in calm water on lakes. \n\nIf you can\u2019t drive a car because of the amount you have had to drink, you shouldn\u2019t be swimming. Your reaction time is slower, your thought processing is slower and not as good. \n\nAlso, just a thought here, when you drown you panic, you will grab onto people to try to stay above the surface, this can kill them. \n\nI once had a kid grab onto me shove me down and stand on my shoulders in a pool because he or she panicked. I survived (obviously), but I still remember standing at the bottom of the pool getting kicked in the head by another kid and wondering if I was going to run out of air before this kid got off me. \n\nAll of which is to say, you could literally kill one of your friends, and you are more likely to do that, because you are all clumped together and they won\u2019t be able to get away from someone who is panicking, quick enough because they are also drunk and their reaction time is also slower.", "People drink and swim in their backyard pool all time.

You can encourage them to make other decisions.  But you can't force it.  And she made her thoughts known.  She chose to stay there and continue yelling.  She then chose to bring it up later.  To me this is a situation where bringing it up later served no purpose.

I live in Chicago.  I've been out with female friends of mine who got drunk and decided they were walking home.   I told them not too.  I offered to call them an uber.  I have even called them an uber.  They still made the choice to walk home.  At that point, there was nothing more I could do.    But what I wasn't going to do is yell at them about it the next day.    At that point, nothing happened, so what is the point in bringing it up later?", "I hear what you\u2019re saying. Trying to force a drunk person to do something is like trying to talk to a wall. However, if someone\u2019s actions under the influence impacted you, I think having a sober conversation about it later on is appropriate.", "I work in Chicago and don't even like walking to the train after dark stone cold sober. But you tried and ultimately we're responsible for our own decisions, even when drinking.", "I'd agree if this is someone you actually had a relationship with.  \n\nIt sounds like (but I could be wrong) this was the girlfriends first time meeting these people.  That just won't go over well.  She was not the person to have that conversation with them.  Maybe her boyfriend, the cousin could have done it.  But not her", "I think that\u2019s the point though really, she didn\u2019t actually want a conversation she just wanted them to say that she was right. I do agree with you though.", "Exactly,  and that is why I think the girlfriend is the problem here.  She tried, which is what she should have done.  But after that, she was beating a dead horse."]}
