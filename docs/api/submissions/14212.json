After that, we went swimming.\n\nMy cousin's girlfriend tried to stop up from going swimming. She said it wasn't safe to swim while drunk. We assured her that we had done so before and were aware that it was riskier than swimming sober. We told her she didn't have to come. She did come and stood by the side the entire time, yelling at us to get out of the water. It was incredibly obnoxious and somewhat dampened the party atmosphere.\n\nWhen the camping trip was over and we were headed back my sister snapped at her \"in case it isn't obvious, you're never invited to come on a family trip again, ever.\" Cousin's girlfriend got really upset. She said she was scared that something would happen to us, that we would die. I told her that would have been our responsibility, not hers, and she can't control what other people do.\n\nMy sister added that driving to and from the campsite on the country's deadliest highway was the most dangerous thing we did all weekend, but she didn't say a word about that, she just wanted to feel morally superior. I cut her off and said we just all have different beliefs and it's fine, so we shouldn't vacation together. Cousin's girlfriend has since reached out to me and tried to make me understand her point of view. I said it's water under the bridge, but she wants me to see her point of view. She said she had a moral obligation to prevent us from drinking and swimming. I said she didn't and I don't want to talk about it anymore.\n\nThings ended up getting heated, and she said she should have known better than to expect more from white trash assholes.

Fear that you all could die (and it\u2019s very dangerous to swim when trashed - gasp reflex is slowed, orientation is impaired, and so on) is not the same as acting morally superior.

Not even a little higher, it\u2019s massively higher. According to studies, alcohol is the leading factor in the majority of adult drowning death with at least 70% of adult drowning victims having alcohol in their system. The higher your BAC, the higher the likelihood of drowning. \n\nAs a 911 operator in an area with heavy aquatic activity, I deal with adult drownings pretty much every single day in the summer season. Some days we have multiple drownings. The vast majority of drowning adults are drunk or on drugs. Any adult drowning I\u2019ve worked where the drowned victim was sober was an absolute freak accident, for example a swimmer getting run over by a jet ski (but the jet ski driver was DUI and speeding in a no wake zone.) Alcohol is involved in basically every aquatic call we take. Even if it\u2019s a missing or drowned kid call, the parent is typically drunk! \n\nIf you made the choice to drink and swim, it\u2019s true that you have to deal with the guilt of that if something goes wrong, but you\u2019re also responsible for the trauma you force onto other people by your bad decision making. From the witnesses, the survivors in your group, the 911 operator, the on scene responders\u2026 you\u2019re forcing all of them into this situation because of your shitty choice. \n\nIts one thing to have *one* beer and enjoy the day, it\u2019s another to be drunk and making poor choices.", "ESH.

Drunk people underestimate dangers, and overestimate their own critical thinking.", "NTA. Drinking and swimming is risky but it was your risk to take. I think if someone were blitzed out of their mind I would understand taking action to stop the person from swimming, or getting buzzed a operating a moter vehicle would justify inter vention. What you did wasn't smart, bit that doesn't make you assholes.", "Agreed, I think it depends on how much the group had to drink as well as the depth of the water, distance from shore, etc. \n\nI pictured calmer water not far from shore and a group of people that\u2019s been drinking but not falling-down drunk, but not sure if I\u2019m just giving OP benefit of the doubt. \n\nRegardless, cousins gf wasn\u2019t invited to babysit or lifeguard, she said her piece and the group made their own decision.

( you really shouldn\u2019t be in the water at all if you are drunk but I\u2019m not going to fight people on wading)\n\nYour reaction times are slower, your coordination is off (which is kinda key in the whole swimming thing) all it takes is for someone to accidentally take a breath too early or gulp some of the water, and panic. \n\nIt is so incredibly dangerous. \n\nIf no one their is lifeguard certified and sober, the ability of someone to help a drunk drowning person, without drowning themselves, is extremely low. \n\nThere is also dry drowning.", "The OP answered some of this in a comment, the water was over their heads but it was still daylight out and there were other groups of people around.", "I feel like when you don't really know people, you can express a concern once, then you have to let it go. \n\nShe chose to continue to berate these adults.

Drinking and swimming, as long as you are not falling down drunk, is a state-beloved past time. Maybe landlocked states feel differently, because they mostly swim in pools?

It was indeed dumb AF.", "Drunk people have drowned in 5-10cm water.", "Wait, you were swimming buzzed but with a group, around others, in water without a current, while it was light out? Perfectly normal adult activity, and indeed less risk than the drive there. NTA", "Ok, I think this is enough to go with a NTA verdict. Sounds like a pretty massive overreaction from cousin\u2019s GF. You were all clumped together. The sun was still out and there were several people who would be able to identify if something bad was happening/going to happen. Sounds like most of the group was not blackout/time warping drunk. I don\u2019t see this as a super high risk situation, her reaction was not warranted. A snarky comment about how you all were being stupid would definitely have been warranted. Certainly calling you white trash was uncalled for.\n\nTo your last point, level of danger absolutely matters. If you all were piss drunk and this was at night with no lights around, I definitely would have gone the opposite way. Being adults with your own free will doesn\u2019t mean people shouldn\u2019t attempt to stop you from doing something incredibly dangerous. I just don\u2019t see this particular situation as incredibly dangerous.", "With this context you\u2019re definitely NTA.\n\nWas there risk involved with your decision? Yes.\n\nThat\u2019s why the sign says \u201cswim at your own risk\u201d not \u201cswim if OP\u2019s cousin\u2019s gf says it\u2019s ok.\u201d", "NTA.  She should have dropped it.  I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s about moral, I think it\u2019s more about her, wanting to be right, and having the last word", "Look, if it were my friends, I would tell them not to do it.\n\nWhen they were sober, I would be ripping them a new one. \n\nI mentioned this elsewhere, but I grew up in a city on the water, which is also surrounded by lakes.\n\nThe number of people who die every year swimming while drunk is stupid. Even in calm water on lakes. \n\nIf you can\u2019t drive a car because of the amount you have had to drink, you shouldn\u2019t be swimming. Your reaction time is slower, your thought processing is slower and not as good. \n\nAlso, just a thought here, when you drown you panic, you will grab onto people to try to stay above the surface, this can kill them. \n\nI once had a kid grab onto me shove me down and stand on my shoulders in a pool because he or she panicked. I survived (obviously), but I still remember standing at the bottom of the pool getting kicked in the head by another kid and wondering if I was going to run out of air before this kid got off me. \n\nAll of which is to say, you could literally kill one of your friends, and you are more likely to do that, because you are all clumped together and they won\u2019t be able to get away from someone who is panicking, quick enough because they are also drunk and their reaction time is also slower.", "People drink and swim in their backyard pool all time. Is it safe, probably not, but people don't scream not too do it. NTA", "Nobody is disputing that it was dangerous/dumb. It most definitely was. The question is whether that danger warranted her to zealously and continuously try to stop them.

I think the context is going to be how drunk they actually were and how much \"swimming\" was actually involved. \nPool's and beaches all serve alcohol. So swimming while drinking is more acceptable to some people. \nWhere I'm from Springs are like creeks. I'm picturing the OP soaking in water like you would a hot tub. Not exerting themselves like you would in a wave pool or treading water.", "Maybe.  But at that point, she still should have let it go", "My sister is 24. I'm 27. Our cousin is 25. My sister was the youngest person there, and the oldest was 29.", "Actually, if she saw the person drown she likely would have tried to help and drowned also. She would probably have been traumatized by the search for someone missing, the call to police, then the dredging of the natural spring to locate the body. Looking the family in the eye at the funeral would be no picnic either.", "Sure, but the original commentor implied that we were breaking campsite rules and/or culture, which is inaccurate.", "I get what you\u2019re saying. But also remember pools and beaches also have lifeguards.", "Aren\u2019t we supposed to take care of our people? Imagine if no one said anything and they got hurt. Then, everyone would be calling the cousin the AH for not intervening and watching out for them.", "I guess here is how I see it.  You can tell people your thoughts.  You can encourage them to make other decisions.  But you can't force it.  And she made her thoughts known.  She chose to stay there and continue yelling.  She then chose to bring it up later.  To me this is a situation where bringing it up later served no purpose.  It would've been better to just make a note to not travel with these people again. \n\nI don't think anyone would have called her an AH for not intervening.  \n\nHere is an example I've been a part of.  I live in Chicago.  I've been out with female friends of mine who got drunk and decided they were walking home.   I told them not too.  I offered to call them an uber.  I have even called them an uber.  They still made the choice to walk home.  At that point, there was nothing more I could do.

Even if they aren't actively being hurtful or aggressive, the smell, the slurring of words, the demeanor of a drunk person can really bring someone back to trauma surrounding an alcoholic they knew. \n\nThen there's also trauma associated with losing someone you love. I have pretty severe PTSD, I witnessed my grandma die when I was 15, and a few years ago lost a friend to an OD. Many other traumatic events throughout my life, have caused me to be quite nervous when the potential for death is increased ever so slightly. \n\nI truly become severely afraid and anxious very easily in regards to many things, most people without extensive trauma wouldn't find nerve wracking. \n\nNow, by no means is it your responsibility to cater to someone else's triggers or emotions, but I do think it's fair to consider, there may have been some underlying factors contributing to her fear. \n\nThe fact she stated she had a \"moral obligation\" is something I say often, I believe as a human, it is my moral obligation to help and protect other humans, even if they may not like it.

It may have made her a buzzkill, but her being concerned or afraid for everyone's safety, is just a sign that she genuinely cares.
