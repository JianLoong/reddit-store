We went to a campground that allows alcohol and has a natural spring. We brought a lot of beer, liquor and hard cider. We drank a lot at our campsite and generally unwound from the work week. After that, we went swimming.\n\nMy cousin's girlfriend tried to stop up from going swimming. She said it wasn't safe to swim while drunk. We assured her that we had done so before and were aware that it was riskier than swimming sober. We told her she didn't have to come. She did come and stood by the side the entire time, yelling at us to get out of the water. It was incredibly obnoxious and somewhat dampened the party atmosphere.\n\nWhen the camping trip was over and we were headed back my sister snapped at her \"in case it isn't obvious, you're never invited to come on a family trip again, ever.\" Cousin's girlfriend got really upset. She said she was scared that something would happen to us, that we would die. I told her that would have been our responsibility, not hers, and she can't control what other people do.\n\nMy sister added that driving to and from the campsite on the country's deadliest highway was the most dangerous thing we did all weekend, but she didn't say a word about that, she just wanted to feel morally superior. I cut her off and said we just all have different beliefs and it's fine, so we shouldn't vacation together. Cousin's girlfriend has since reached out to me and tried to make me understand her point of view. I said it's water under the bridge, but she wants me to see her point of view. She said she had a moral obligation to prevent us from drinking and swimming. I said she didn't and I don't want to talk about it anymore.\n\nThings ended up getting heated, and she said she should have known better than to expect more from white trash assholes.

How drunk are we talking? How deep is this natural spring? Were you all generally within the same area or was the spring fairly large(ie would it have been possible for someone to go out of sight and drown without anyone noticing)? Sounds like it was at night, was there additional lighting so you all would be able to see if someone was drowning? Was anybody sober/not drunk so they could potentially save someone from drowning? \n\nBasically just trying to gauge how safe/unsafe this activity was, because I think that is relevant to gauge whether cousin\u2019s GF\u2019s reaction was appropriate.", "Idk everyone kind of seems annoying here\u2026", "ESH", "ESH. The cousin's gf was right. Swimming while drunk is dangerous and stupid. However,  after pointing that out to the group of idiots, she should have let it go. I agree, though, you all shouldn't travel together. You guys sound obnoxious, and if this was a public campground,  you probably annoyed all the campers around you because drunk people tend to be loud AF.", "YTA. She wasn\u2019t acting \u201cmorally superior\u201d and this wasn\u2019t about beliefs. It doesn\u2019t sound like she didn\u2019t want you to get drunk, it sounds like she was concerned that swimming while shitfaced is dangerous. You\u2019re the one who acted like it\u2019s about \u201cbeliefs.\u201d I veer a little towards E S H due to her not just walking away after you chose to be completely dismissive of the very real risk and the \u201cwhite trash assholes\u201d comment, but the latter was after she\u2019d apparently been berated repeatedly. Fear that you all could die (and it\u2019s very dangerous to swim when trashed - gasp reflex is slowed, orientation is impaired, and so on) is not the same as acting morally superior. And no, it doesn\u2019t much sound like you tried to get along with her at all.\n\nYou probably just ruined either a) your cousin\u2019s relationship with his girlfriend or b) your relationship with your cousin. Either way, grow up, dude.", "ESH\n\nHer - for cursing at you and calling you what she did. That was really uncalled for.\n\nYou all guys - for frankly being dumb.

It'll be all fun and games until someone actually drowns.... you blew it off because nothing happened or has happened, but you know what kills people? Complacency. \n\nIf she was \"morally superior,\" she probably would have nagged about everything, including the \"most dangerous highway\"... You have all had fun in the past and want to keep it going for as many years as possible, I get it, but it still doesn't mean you get to be an AH", "YTA. You were admittedly drunk and she was sober. She was the much better judge of your ability to swim in your condition. And your attitude that one of you dying would be none of her concern speaks volumes about what a PITA you and your sister were, if that\u2019s what you think even when sober. You should have apologized for stressing her out with your drunken antics, not doubled down.

If your drinking is impeding other peoples safety/comfortability, it\u2019s a problem. I had a friend do this very same thing and he hit his head. I\u2019m glad people cared about your safety.", "YTA. It's not just your risk. Drunk swimmers put everyone around them at risk as well.\n\nYou and all your drunk idiot friends and family need to realize that if you're drowning, people are going to try to save you.

While the campground allowed alcohol I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t want rowdy drunk people doing dangerous things.

It is incredibly dangerous to swim while drunk, especially since I'm assuming nighttime. If someone died and she didn't at least try to save them, who gets in trouble and has to live with that? Who's family is going to blame the sober person? Oh wait, I know! Just because it didn't happen this time won't mean it won't happen the next. She was literally looking out for your lives, and you decided she wanted to be morally superior ? What she said was wrong, and I won't condone that, but that also doesn't mean you were right.", "NTA, for the question asked.\n\nI think most of us can agree it\u2019s not too intelligent to get intoxicated and enter an unpredictable body of water. I would say YTA for potentially putting other people in danger, but that\u2019s not what was asked.\n\nIt sounds like she went way overboard trying to stop adults from doing something they were going to do. Anything other than \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t do this\u201d is overkill. Standing by the side telling you to get out, and still talking about it days later is insane.", "NTA in the moment ig you could give her a pass for how she acted but she still acted the same way days later. At a certain point it goes from caring about your safety to wanting to be morally superior. I would just advise making it crystal clear to your cousin as to why she isnt welcomed.", "NTA, different strokes and all.", "NTA - There isn't some universal, absolute prohibition on combining alcohol with swimming. Adults judge the risk/reward calculus for themselves and make a decision that works for them-- without forcing anyone else to go along with it.", "NTA. \nYou tried to talk through it with her, and she kept trying to force her \"moral beliefs\" on you. \nIt's your vacation, you have a right to choose who to bring.", "NAH just many obnoxius people", "NTA My first thought after reading the headline, how drunk were you?  But it seems cousin's gf needs bit of tape over her mouth.", "YTA\n\nShe was right, being drunk and swimming without a sober person keeping watch will go right plenty of times, until it doesn't.\n\nETA: and you or one of your adult friends having an accident does impact more than just you drunk people.\n\nOther groups will have to deal with the fallout of a corpse being dragged out, in the group itself people will jabe to deal with guilt.\n\nAnd emergency services will have to deal with your stupid shit as well instead of being able to assist in proper emergencies.\n\n\nYeah definitely YTA", "NTA - She's on some moral high horse, or maybe the spectrum, either way, her actions were kinda nuts.    \n     \nI don't understand what she needed from you at the end but her calling you all white trash when she didn't get whatever it was shows how she's likely viewed y'all all along.     \n     \nYou went camping, drinking, and swimming.  Big deal.  Young people be young people all the time and this is just what young people do.     \n      \nAnyone that says they have a moral obligation over petty stuff is not someone you generally want to spend much time around.", "NTA.

She dug her own grave, and deserved everything said to her. I've had vacations like this before, where that one friend of a friend is not vibing with everyone else, it sucks.", "NTA.\n\nSo she decided to play \"morality police\" around a bunch of adults who were on vacation, then got angry that nobody wants her around. Shocking.", "Title is misleading. I don't think anyone had a problem with you being drunk. \n\nIn any case - if the spring is relatively benign - like no current or major hazards - I would say your cousin's girlfriend should have let it go.

Not even a little higher, it\u2019s massively higher. According to studies, alcohol is the leading factor in the majority of adult drowning death with at least 70% of adult drowning victims having alcohol in their system. The higher your BAC, the higher the likelihood of drowning. \n\nAs a 911 operator in an area with heavy aquatic activity, I deal with adult drownings pretty much every single day in the summer season. Some days we have multiple drownings. The vast majority of drowning adults are drunk or on drugs. Any adult drowning I\u2019ve worked where the drowned victim was sober was an absolute freak accident, for example a swimmer getting run over by a jet ski (but the jet ski driver was DUI and speeding in a no wake zone.) Alcohol is involved in basically every aquatic call we take. Even if it\u2019s a missing or drowned kid call, the parent is typically drunk! \n\nIf you made the choice to drink and swim, it\u2019s true that you have to deal with the guilt of that if something goes wrong, but you\u2019re also responsible for the trauma you force onto other people by your bad decision making. From the witnesses, the survivors in your group, the 911 operator, the on scene responders\u2026 you\u2019re forcing all of them into this situation because of your shitty choice. \n\nIts one thing to have *one* beer and enjoy the day, it\u2019s another to be drunk and making poor choices.", "ESH.

Drunk people underestimate dangers, and overestimate their own critical thinking.", "NTA. Drinking and swimming is risky but it was your risk to take. I think if someone were blitzed out of their mind I would understand taking action to stop the person from swimming, or getting buzzed a operating a moter vehicle would justify inter vention. What you did wasn't smart, bit that doesn't make you assholes.", "Agreed, I think it depends on how much the group had to drink as well as the depth of the water, distance from shore, etc. \n\nI pictured calmer water not far from shore and a group of people that\u2019s been drinking but not falling-down drunk, but not sure if I\u2019m just giving OP benefit of the doubt. \n\nRegardless, cousins gf wasn\u2019t invited to babysit or lifeguard, she said her piece and the group made their own decision.

( you really shouldn\u2019t be in the water at all if you are drunk but I\u2019m not going to fight people on wading)\n\nYour reaction times are slower, your coordination is off (which is kinda key in the whole swimming thing) all it takes is for someone to accidentally take a breath too early or gulp some of the water, and panic. \n\nIt is so incredibly dangerous. \n\nIf no one their is lifeguard certified and sober, the ability of someone to help a drunk drowning person, without drowning themselves, is extremely low. \n\nThere is also dry drowning.", "The OP answered some of this in a comment, the water was over their heads but it was still daylight out and there were other groups of people around.", "I feel like when you don't really know people, you can express a concern once, then you have to let it go. \n\nShe chose to continue to berate these adults.

Sounds like a pretty massive overreaction from cousin\u2019s GF. You were all clumped together. The sun was still out and there were several people who would be able to identify if something bad was happening/going to happen. Sounds like most of the group was not blackout/time warping drunk. I don\u2019t see this as a super high risk situation, her reaction was not warranted. A snarky comment about how you all were being stupid would definitely have been warranted. Certainly calling you white trash was uncalled for.\n\nTo your last point, level of danger absolutely matters. If you all were piss drunk and this was at night with no lights around, I definitely would have gone the opposite way. Being adults with your own free will doesn\u2019t mean people shouldn\u2019t attempt to stop you from doing something incredibly dangerous. I just don\u2019t see this particular situation as incredibly dangerous.", "With this context you\u2019re definitely NTA.\n\nWas there risk involved with your decision?

Even in calm water on lakes. \n\nIf you can\u2019t drive a car because of the amount you have had to drink, you shouldn\u2019t be swimming. Your reaction time is slower, your thought processing is slower and not as good. \n\nAlso, just a thought here, when you drown you panic, you will grab onto people to try to stay above the surface, this can kill them. \n\nI once had a kid grab onto me shove me down and stand on my shoulders in a pool because he or she panicked. I survived (obviously), but I still remember standing at the bottom of the pool getting kicked in the head by another kid and wondering if I was going to run out of air before this kid got off me. \n\nAll of which is to say, you could literally kill one of your friends, and you are more likely to do that, because you are all clumped together and they won\u2019t be able to get away from someone who is panicking, quick enough because they are also drunk and their reaction time is also slower.", "People drink and swim in their backyard pool all time.

You can encourage them to make other decisions.  But you can't force it.  And she made her thoughts known.  She chose to stay there and continue yelling.  She then chose to bring it up later.  To me this is a situation where bringing it up later served no purpose.

I live in Chicago.  I've been out with female friends of mine who got drunk and decided they were walking home.   I told them not too.  I offered to call them an uber.  I have even called them an uber.  They still made the choice to walk home.  At that point, there was nothing more I could do.    But what I wasn't going to do is yell at them about it the next day.    At that point, nothing happened, so what is the point in bringing it up later?", "I hear what you\u2019re saying. Trying to force a drunk person to do something is like trying to talk to a wall. However, if someone\u2019s actions under the influence impacted you, I think having a sober conversation about it later on is appropriate.", "I work in Chicago and don't even like walking to the train after dark stone cold sober. But you tried and ultimately we're responsible for our own decisions, even when drinking.", "I'd agree if this is someone you actually had a relationship with.  \n\nIt sounds like (but I could be wrong) this was the girlfriends first time meeting these people.  That just won't go over well.  She was not the person to have that conversation with them.  Maybe her boyfriend, the cousin could have done it.  But not her", "I think that\u2019s the point though really, she didn\u2019t actually want a conversation she just wanted them to say that she was right. I do agree with you though.", "Exactly,  and that is why I think the girlfriend is the problem here.  She tried, which is what she should have done.  But after that, she was beating a dead horse.", "NTA. She is right about drinking and swimming being risky although you still have the right to make your own choices and she didn't seem to go about getting her message across in a productive manner.", "NTA. She should have stopped once you all were in the water. Plus, she shouldn\u2019t have called you and continued trying to get you to understand where she was coming from. You all understood but you didn\u2019t agree with what she was saying. Her inability to just let it go made her the AH in this situation. One warning would have been enough.", "I mean, it really depends on how drunk you were and how dangerous the swimming spot really was, but probably ESH.", "It\u2019s hard to pass a judgment on this one because\u2026\n\nYes, you are an adult and should be allowed some autonomy. You are making your own decisions and unlike drunk driving you are only endangering yourself and the other idiots swimming with you (unless she decides to jump in to save someone, I wouldn\u2019t). This is all assuming, of course, that you actually know the risks of drinking and swimming. Not just that your coordination and reaction time is off, but that the water temperature makes it more likely that you will faint in the water. If you faint, you will not struggle, making it unlikely someone will notice your disappearance unless they are directly engaged with you. \n\nBut she has a point as well. She only ruined your vacation because nothing happened. If someone had drowned or gotten severely injured, that guilt would have followed all of you for a long time, possibly for life. You WOULD NOT simply pass it off as \u2018well we were adults making our own decisions and now we must live with the consequences\u2019 and neither would the families. \n\nWe all make stupid decisions. I\u2019m fact, I used to make the exact same one you are making. We used to go tubing down the river with ice chests full of alcohol. We got lucky, some didn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t until you see and experience the ones that didn\u2019t or you have more to live for that you start changing those decisions. \n\nAnd comparing every decision to each other is a misnomer. Such as \u2018well driving is dangerous so swimming drunk should be fine\u2019. Uh no. If you are going to go that route you might as well say \u2018well we drove today so we might as well stand on the lip of an erupting volcano\u2019. Feel free to compare the stats, but when you come up with lower drowning stats, also keep in mind the sheer amount of people driving on a daily basis vs people swimming on a daily basis. If you do that, I think you\u2019ll find the drowning stats far more staggering.", "NTA, but my petty ass would send screen captures to the cousin.", "NTA\n\nI gather from this post that this took place in a more rural area, and that most of you are from a similar area. IDK what GF thinks happens in places like this, but drinking and then going for a swim is probably on the safer side of what you guys could have been doing. This is how you guys live out there, this is socially acceptable for your area.\n\nRegardless of how safe or unsafe your activities were, nobody appointed her the safety warden of your group. It's fair for her to express her objections to what you're doing, but she doesn't get to control what other adults do. You guys are comfortable with the risk, she isn't. She can exclude herself if she doesn't agree, and she's overstepping by continuing to badger you for your own decisions.\n\nI think you have a very level headed take on the whole thing. Obviously GF and everyone else have different levels of comfort with risk taking, and if that's going to cause problems, maybe the camping trip isn't for her. I think sister was a bit much snapping and bluntly uninviting her to all future trips, that's unnecessarily rude.\n\nLast point, the spring is on the campground, and I would have to imagine the campground management knows people swim in it. If drunken swimming was that much of a problem, they wouldn't allow alcohol on site.", "NTA. Your cousins gf was way out of line with her behavior. It\u2019s very annoying when people who don\u2019t drink act as if that makes them superior. Clearly she needs some help because screaming at adults who invited you on a trip is not normal. I agree it\u2019s best to avoid vacationing together in the future. Why didn\u2019t your cousin put gf in her place?", "NTA Your cousin\u2019s girlfriend gave the warning. You are an adult and within your right to ignore her warnings. You didn\u2019t ask her to be your guardian or lifeguard.", "YTA. Not only is swimming while drunk dangerous, which also puts other people at risk if they have to try to save you from yourself, a bunch of drunken idiots at a campground ruins camping for others. Speaking as someone who used to work in parks, there is a very good chance you ruined other people's camping trip as well.", "NTA. Cousin\u2019s girlfriend sounds like she does not fit in with the rest of you, and calling you white trash is shitty. It\u2019s not her job to police the behaviour of other adults.", "NTA", "YTA.\n\n\"God, guys, my cousins girlfriend doesn't want us to drown and die! She such a bitch for caring about our well being.\"\n\nIf you don't value your life, that's one thing, but to get mad at someone who was looking out for you *when you were intentionally putting yourselves in danger* is absurd. You might regret not inviting her because she seems to be the only person in this group responsible enough to make sure you dont come back home in a body bag. \n\nThis title is misleading and dishonest. \n\nYour behavior is a liability for the park, and if one of you idiots had actually drowned, the park would be forced to rescind its rule about alcohol. Your actions do not affect just you. Imagine dying and being known as that asshole who forced the park to ban booze and implement safety features because *grown adults* dont have enough forethought or common sense to know *not to swim while heavily drunk.*\n\nThis comment:\n\n>I told her that would have been our responsibility, not hers\n\nYou do realize watching someone drown is incredibly traumatizing, right? From a legal standpoint, *it would be her problem.* When someone is fully capable of saving someone else from drowning, there could be *very serious* legal ramifications if she didn't intervene. The park or someone in your family could've sued her. Do you seriously have no consideration for how your actions affect others?\n\nYou also wouldn't be singing the party pooper tune if one of you did drown because you'd just be blaming her for someone's death.\n\nAll of you should be apologizing to her and thanking her for keeping you safe since it's obvious none of you care about your own lives.", "NTA while I think it was foolish to swim if you were drunk (I know someone who drowned at their graduation party for that reason) she also overreacted. It was fine to say her opinion and express her concern, but at that point she should have left it alone, not stood there screaming at you all.", "Info did you have life jackets?  We float the river pretty often and will usually bring beer in a floating cooler, but we make sure everyone has a life jacket on if we\u2019re combining alcohol with water.

If you were completely trashed I can see the concern.", "NTA, it was ok for her to raise an issue with swimming drunk. its ok for you to ignore her advice. she possibly created a more dangerous atmosphere by shouting at the sidelines winding you all up. your sister is probably slightly an asshole for her comment about not being welcome again, but the big asshole is cousins girlfriends for firstly carrying on when you've disregarded her concerns and then carrying it on days later and then calling you all white trash assholes.", "NTA - if she was worried she should have said something and then let it go, yelling at and harassing you was ridiculous. All these people chiding you for swimming while buzzed sound insane lol", "Lots of people have been told over and over again about responsible drinking and that it's everyone's job to prevent accidents.

There are other homes and summer camps in our immediate area; there's also a large sandbar within sight of our home that attracts constant visitors. Drinking is a staple, for most of the people, while they enjoy the water/sandbars, but not something I do. I've never considered telling anyone (and most of the owners are close friends) what they should or shouldn't do. If I'm around, I might pay closer attention if I think someone is obviously intoxicated but I'd never think it's my place to tell other adults what to do. There's no reasoning with drunks, anyway, and people will do what they want. Cousin's gf is way out of line and a normal adult would just say (to themselves) \"this is too stressful, I won't be in this situation, again \" and move on.  She didn't enjoy the experience but rather than bow out, she wants the group to accept/recognize her views.

Secondary drowning is still the result of water being present.  0cm water literally means no water.", "It\u2019s a moral obligation to many people, not a choice. YTA", "Correct. They did not say that swimming drunk is the most fun thing they can imagine in their life. Good job!", "I think this is a case of being a non-native speaker. \"Most funny\" and \"most fun\" are two different things.", "Then stop fighting for alcoholics to do whatever they want with no regard for other people. Thanks, bye.", "Which part is supposed to be fun?", "And continued the next day. And relitigated it every time you saw them.", "Yeah, here's the thing. Everyone thinks you're an ass for being the cautious one, till someone actually dies. Then suddenly everything's horrible for everyone and all the calculations are different.\n\nI've never even had someone in my circle die young, but by God I've seen two houses burn down, one by gas explosion (which was near enough to shatter the windows in the room my 5yo was playing in), all because people did stupid stuff, and I can tell you that \"it'll be fine\" isn't fucking magic. Killing the vibe versus the entire group witnessing someone's life ending at 20, geez, how do I choose??\n\nLike the thread's OP here, my judgment is INFO b/c the details matter, but man, \"they're responsible for themselves,\" while it forcibly has to be true some of the time, does not make you feel much better after a death.", "Right, but what alternative is there? There's no way to take someone's keys to the water. All she can do is scream and yell, which she did, and it wasn't working.", "But you can't control the actions of others and you certainly can't dictate their morality, which she was also trying to do. At some point,  people have to be allowed to make their own choices even if they are choosing to put themselves at risk. \n\nAdditionally, this slippery slope you call logic could be applied to all sorts of things that put us at risk including driving (sober or otherwise), eating ultra-processed food, boating activities in general, hiking, tanning, flying on an airplane.  Do people have a moral obligation to stop living life because an accidental death would be too hard on the family?", "So you\u2019re saying secondary drowning can happen during the time people are in 0 cm of water due to previous exposure to water? Sounds like you\u2019re agreeing with me. Literally possible.", "People have an obligation to put their life in danger. Even if it was a moral obligation, people still have a choice.", "I'm doing a good job indeed. You, however, should really practice your logical and reading skills. Try drinking some vodka and deeping into cold water sometimes, it is really helpful!", "Nope, i think i got those words correct. I just don't like when people, who try to do things wise and safely, are called boring.", "Swimming drunk. You know, the thing this entire post is about lol swimming and drinking is fun as fuck. I've never seen an adult party that had a pool that didn't also have alcohol.\n\n\nEdit: and before you say it, not just pool's. Creek river lake whatever. Drinking and swimming is fun. If you don't wanna take the risk then don't. But don't shit on how other people have fun.", "Eh, someone in your dying while you\u2019re out camping does put a bit of a downer on things.", "For you, sure. Not everyone feels like they have that choice. Especially drunk people who are more likely to take risks.", "Lol, you are the one with the reading skills that turned 'no fun' into \"swimming drunk is the most funny thing you can imagine in ur life\" and then insulted them over the words you made up. \n\nSome vodka and a soak in cold water sounds pretty rad. I'll meet you there!", "You definitely didn't made up that i insulted them. Bet i was using some nasty nasty slurs there. Maybe also some discrimination."]}
