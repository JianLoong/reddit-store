Sounds like you are looking out for her. Alcohol abuse at her age would be especially bad news.", "NTA.\nThis is a separate party for friends away from the family party.

She is shown she can\u2019t be trusted when it comes to alcohol and boys. I think your decision make sense. If she only had like one alcohol attempt. Then you could allow her, but punish her for drinking. I have had one attempt out of curiosity cause I have with a small sip. Didn\u2019t like the taste. I was curious and never told about alcohol. She\u2019s older than me and clearly just entering her teen phase. She can be mad, but it\u2019s not a family event so it\u2019s fine if she misses out.", "You couldn\u2019t ask someone (or more) to watch out for 14f for an hour or 2-then she could split before any drunkenness.

But would it be different if the boys in her room were short? \ud83e\udd14", "INFO: will you and your husband be at the party and able to supervise your daughter?", "i mean NTA, but also like, wouldnt it be better for her to drink with family than to sneak out, drink at some random party, get arrested, etc? Look, the kid is gonna drink and do drugs, that ship has sailed. now its up to you to either protect her while she's doing it, or nurture an environment of lies and deceit. cause she gonna lie, and she gonna decieve to do the things she wants to do. unless you plan on keeping her locked up in a tower, you have to ask yourself what the best option for her is, and it isnt militant abstinence. thats just going to push her away, and get her into the wrong sort of shit. \n\n  \nat this point you know she has the taste for it. all you can do is provide a controlled environment for such behavior in the future. and if you arent willing to do that, then go ahead and expect her to end up pregnant at 16, with multiple charges on her record. y|  \n\n\nshe gonna do it either way. its up to you what path it takes her down.", "YTA, because you are setting a precedent you'll never be able to maintain, and may be counterproductive.  You need to think through how you are going to manage a very real issue.  \n\nYou are entirely right to address these issues with your daughter, which are extra concerning given the family history and her very young age.  But excluding her from all events where alcohol is present is never going to work, especially a birthday party involving family, and at minimum it is premature.  It is just going to engender resentment and make her turn further against you.  That could turn her further toward alcohol to escape, not away from it.\n\nYou would be wise to negotiate this.  Make sure she understands and acknowledges the legitimacy of your concerns, and use this as an opportunity to prove she can resist the temptation.  Make her sign a written pledge to not drink at the party.  Make sure she understands the consequences if she violates it.  Get a breathalyzer:  they are inexpensive these days, and use it upon her return.  If you can trust your sons to help you police her without them being resentful/annoyed (or part of the problem), do it.  If she violates her pledge, more extreme solutions are in order, but the key is that she knows and has control over the consequences of her actions.\n\nBeyond that, you need a real plan going forward.  Like your sons, she is going to drink when she is of age.  She also will drink in her late teens and pre-21 years and you won't be able to stop it.  14 is too young to experiment, but when she reaches the age that most teens drink, try to develop a culture of trust, which is more geared toward management and safety and open communication, not prohibition.  Right now, she is doing things behind your back.  She does not trust you.  You need to fix that.\n\nFinally, you need to figure out if her alcohol use to date is a one-off thing, or if there is more widespread use that may be an addiction problem already.  Given her young age, my guess is she's just experimented a couple times, but maybe not:  hiding alcohol and breaking into liquor cabinets are often associated with addictive behavior. She is your kid.  Figure it out.\n\nGood luck.", "Past circumstances can make for a difficult decision, but imo you are still the asshole because you should never separate immediate family from a family party. You could have invited her but just have kept an eye on her. Your decision will lead to resentment in the family.", "NTA without her history i would have said you were TA for not letting her be part of her brothers celebrations", "Just to weigh in on the other side,you don\u2019t think her sibs can adequately watch her? If it\u2019s not that big a party and they\u2019re sure most of the guests wouldn\u2019t slip her any,might it be safe enough if she leaves at a reasonable time? \n\nIf you don\u2019t think so,definitely NTA,her health and safety come first \ud83d\udc4d", "If something were to happen and police were called to party??, there might be a problem for you &/or adults at the party. \u201cContributing to delinquency of a minor\u201d is against the law.

She shouldn\u2019t even be around alcohol anyway", "Even putting aside the poor behavior your daughter showed by breaking into your own cabinet, a 21+ party with alcohol and no family/adult supervision is no place for a 14y girl.

Maybe unfair, but worth caution.", "exactly that just seems like a setup for the kid to be taken advantage of in some way", "that\u2019s exactly what i was thinking, letting a 14 go to a party full of college kids and alcohol just seems like your asking for trouble.

She attended the family party.", "IDK, a party full of young 20-something year old guys is not necessarily where I'd want my 14 year old daughter to be, especially since we don't know what the parental supervision situation is.

Since OP did not mention it, we should assume there is no obstacle to her attending except the parents.  Certainly the kid seems to believe that, as she is directing her anger at OP.\n\nTo your other point, as I said it is a \"birthday party involving family,\" which is to say it seems to involve close families, including hers, as both brothers are going.  If she didn't know them, presumably she would have no interest in going.", "Yeah I was envisioning it as more of a casual family affair among two close families, not a hard-drinking all-adult sausage fest where the 14 year old kid is an outlier.

Unless they\u2019re leading things off with keg stands,I don\u2019t think that would be a lot to ask so little sis could be a part of it for a bit.", "Why did you imagine that when OP literally said there was a separate family party and this was a friends party with lots of alcohol? The post was clear unless it was later edited", "NTA, but if your 14 year old is already showing signs of having issues with alcohol you need to be proactive about her mental health while you still have any say in medical decisions (i.e. get her in therapy).  Too many parents treat teenage substance abuse as solely a disciplinary issue and go for the 'tough love' approach and then wonder why their adult child is spiraling and doesn't trust them.", "Dumb kids aren\u2019t the same as bad kids, and all kids are dumb", "Counseling works for that too.

Even if Son said, oh I only invited good friend(could you guarantee that each of them wouldn't bring a stranger friend?)\n\nEven if your daughter didn't drink a drop(sure), she would be surrounded by drunken people.

She is not an adult.", ">She\u2019s now been on strike, hiding away in her room, and won\u2019t talk to us.\n\nNTA But keep an eye on her. She sounds likely to sneak out late at night, not understanding she's still a child and her brothers are actual adults. This can all end very poorly for her, and possibly sneaking off to get drunk at college aged parties is incredibly dangerous. (Shes definitely done other stuff you're unaware of. You don't just start by stealing your parents alcohol. That's an escalation. It sounds like she's drinking outside the home already). \n\nThis might be incredibly uncomfortable for everybody, but It might be time for you and your husband to sit down with her and show her the risk of underage girls getting drunk at college aged parties. Even getting drunk at parties that involve their own families. \n\nAnd don't sugarcoat it. Show her documentaries about survivors of rape. Make her read books. Maybe even go and do charity work at women shelters. Also, cases like Brock Allen Turner are very recent and shows how people aren't even punished when caught. \n\n>along with us finding tall boys hidden in her room. \n\nI think I'm just so tired right now, because I literally thought there was like tall children hiding in her closet for a second lmao", "INFO\n\nYou said this was the friends party and not the family party.
