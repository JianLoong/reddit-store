He\u2019s holding you back by saying those things. He wants to discourage you. Homeschooling is a way to control you. You need public school to learn social skills and meet kids your own age. The fact he said \u201cthey make you do homework at public school\u201d as if that\u2019s a bad thing is so red flag, are you not doing homework or projects in your current curriculum? To manage homework and course material is to learn responsibility and time management skills.", "NTA. Your dad is isolating you. It's a common control tactic. You are 15 and should have friends and a normal life.", "NTA. You are allowed to have feelings.", "NTA, your father should be listening to you and acknowledging how you are feeling. It really looks like he is using homeschooling as a form of control and not because it's better for you.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nI was homeschooled from 3rd grade til 10th grade. I hated every second of it. You don\u2019t get real help from teachers when you need it (I ended up failing then just getting my GED). You don\u2019t really get to interact with people in person and to do extracurricular activities like sports or clubs you either have to pay for it or it\u2019ll be online. It\u2019s already hard enough for a teenager to make friends at school normally but homeschooling makes it so much more awkward and impossible.", "100% NTA. \n\nYour father has the stupidest excuses for homeschool. The math is really hard.\u201d?? WTF? So your father doesn\u2019t want you to do hard math. What exactly does your father want you to do with your life if he doesn\u2019t seem to want you to learn much in school?\n\nI know people who home school, or want to, because public school is not hard enough and they want their kids to be challenged. \n\nHe sounds very controlling with his desire to homeschool you and shelter you.", "While I recognize there *are* exceptions, I'm of the firm belief that broadly speaking, home schooling is child abuse. Again, there are exceptions, but that is my starting assumption, and the burden of proof to the contrary is on the parents. It certainly sounds like your parents wouldn't meet it. \n\nSo much NTA.", "NTA, your dad is being creepy and controlling. I have friends that were homeschooled and some thrived and still had tons of friends. Others didn't thrive and needed to go to school for social interaction and that's ok. You are someone who has expressed needing/wanting to go to school for the interaction. Your dad needs to listen to that.", "INFO: what reason does he give for homeschooling you?

One of the main counterbalance options of my daydream home school would be to belong to clubs and societies, sports, games, music, whatever ... to develop social skills and connections ! \n\nMaybe OP could look that way if changing next year is still too soon / too difficult to get. \n\nThe math argument would be of use as well, like homeschooling needs to reach the proper standards of the area so the dad admits the quality of homeschooling is not that good. Or maybe he plays with OP insecurities... I would def dig into that angle to make this situation change. Good luck OP, NTA", "NTA\n\nYour father is causing you a lot of harm. You need to escape this situation. Do you have any other family in your life, or other adults you trust? You need to talk to someone.", "NTA, have you tried a homeschool coop to make friends? I am homeschooling my kids this year and I already have plans with them so my kids do get friends. We tried public school but they both were bullied heavily and the school would do nothing at all. \n\nI homeschooled from 8th-12th. The actual schooling I liked, the control my mom and stepdad had was the bad part. My little brother got screwed over because he had no socialization. I saw what it did to him. I would take him out to clubs and stuff so he could make friends but it was rough. \n\nCan you talk to anyone else? See if they can talk to your dad?", "NTA\n\nMy impression of homeschooling - correct me if I'm wrong - is that it's a tactic for conservative religious nuts to isolate their children from anything remotely suggesting a progressive outlook on life.  Sure, there are problems with the public school system, especially in financially-strapped regions, but at least it lets students interact with others.  You have my sympathies.", "NTA. \nI was homeschooled most of my school years. \nWhile I loved it (we met with other homeschoolers, I got to travel and we did all kinds of activities for school) I can see why it\u2019s harmful for you. \nIf he insists on homeschooling you, I suggest asking him to join a homeschool Group in your area,  to get you out there to be social and do things other than just sitting at a computer. \nIf he doesn\u2019t like that option, keep pushing to go to school.  it sounds like it would better for your mental health to go to a public/private school. \nHomework isn\u2019t that bad, math won\u2019t be hard, you\u2019ll have people guiding you at a school to help you with those things. Tell him you\u2019ll flourish in school.", "NTA.  You're supposed to have a social life.  The human body was not meant to sit at a computer for 6 hours a day.  It was meant to walk around.   \nAlso, I doubly think that you're NTA, because most homeschool is either cult-like, a scam, or highly useless. (You really think that a diploma from Education R Us Homeschool Program is going to mean the same as an actual school?)", "NTA.   Homeschooling is an absolutely terrible idea in 99% of cases.

College was still a culture shock, but I wonder if framing this as a way to make progress towards next steps would help? Your situation sounds concerning if your dad continues to push back (being controlling is scary), but it could be that he is nervous about his baby growing up and getting ready to move on to bigger things. It could be good to make a pros/ cons list to go over with your parents (to show you are considering dad\u2019s concerns/ also share some pros he might not have thought of) and, based on how he reacts, ask a relative or family friend to intervene. Again, as a former homeschooler, we really need those social interactions to form normal friendships, know what\u2019s okay and what\u2019s not okay in general (ie, how \u201cfriends\u201d and significant others should treat us and not accept mistreatment), and grow into well rounded people. So many of the experiences others have, we don\u2019t get, and that can really set us back. WITH THAT SAID\u2014I hope you get to go to high school and make friends! Don\u2019t be scared to be the \u201cweird kid\u201d asking questions, and for sure ask for help if you need it. I was so overwhelmed at first, but it was really so much fun after I settled in :) and I don\u2019t think I could have gone away to school if I hadn\u2019t had that stepping stone first!", "NTA - why are you being homeschooled to begin with? Did it start with Covid? \n\nDo you live in a community that has youth groups? A local gym with fitness classes? I know a gym I went to offered youth classes to girls 13-17. There are also homeschool groups (I homeschooled my son when he struggled with his teachers and friends and joined one) and they are for socializing and they do field trips together etc. my friend home schools her kids and they have a weekly gym class with other homeschool kids, do swim classes together and schedule monthly get togethers. \n\nHer kids don\u2019t really want to homeschool either, but I feel like it\u2019s more for her convenience to homeschool them and it calms her anxiety of them being in school. There\u2019s no convincing her that her kids would be happier in school. So sometimes you have to pivot and move on to plan b, find a way to get out and make friends.", "NTA - call the school district and start the application process.

How about close relatives? Are there any adults in your family you can talk to about this? If there are, start with them and discuss the matter with them. Your dad is the authority figure in your relationship. You need someone he doesn't have authority over supporting you.\n\nYou can also shift your arguments. Don't push going to public school. Say you are concerned about college admissions and you want to start extra-curricular activities that look good on your application. Team sports and academic clubs.

Maybe your mother can advocate for you, or can they put in you in a homeschool situation with other kids? I\u2019d suggest asking your parents if you three can meet together with the guidance counselor at the high school and discuss what strategies you can put in place to ensure that you continue to succeed academically were you to return to public school. There\u2019s no harm in a meeting, and it is a good idea to talk about it with an educational professional. It seems a bit much to still be insisting on homeschool after what, 2-3 years? You should get another chance now that you\u2019re in high school.", "So if your grades tanked worse at home you could go back to school?\n\nI\u2019m a responsible adult, so I would never suggest such a thing\u2026\u2026..", "Are your parents together?

Maybe there are tutorial sessions with a teacher. Maybe there is peer tutoring. Could there be different course options? It was years ago (and didn\u2019t apply to me cause I was really good at math) but my high school had options like an intro math 11 course which you could take before math 11, to prepare you (math 11 was required for graduation and university/college). Or an alternate version of math 11, which took out stuff that was pre-req for math 12. \n\nI would research local high schools and see what math supports exist. Maybe you can find resources and then present to your father that you will be better off in public school.", "Hearing this makes me really worry for you OP!  \n\n\nIf you're struggling with math, you should be getting more support and help from teachers to help you get better at math, not be told to do less math! I feel very strongly about this. You can always decide later, as an adult, that math is not for you, but if you're deprived of the chance to learn now, making it up later is going to be hard (I had friends in this situation and it was not great for them). \n\nIt would be one thing if you were being homeschooled so you could get specific supports, but it really doesn't sound like that's what's happening. It sounds like you're being neglected.", "yeah my mom is a bit hesitant about me going to public school but she wont force me to stay in homeschool. she even says she misses driving me to school. so maybe i will talk to her and my dad and tell them how i feel", "yeah i agree", "Also, can you make a case for any extracurriculars you\u2019re interested you\u2019ll be missing out on\u2014sports, theatre, music, student government, etc.?", "yes", "ohhh okay thank you so much", "by the way, this is kinda off topic, but here are some of the math resources i recommend for math help: any book by diana mckellar, street fighting mathematics (i didn\u2019t read this one myself but my teacher taught us some of the principals from\nit and it was recommended to me many times, i think it\u2019ll be better fit for the end of high school math), khan academy and crash course (everyone knows those two but they are good they deserve the hype)\n\nETA: my biggest piece of math advice is also just whiteboards. math is intimidating and the idea of having to write something down and it being wrong stresses people out. our school had whiteboard desks and at home i had a GIANT whiteboard meant for a wall that i would just drag out on the floor. if you try something you think is dumb and you feel silly, you can just do it and then wipe it away with NO EVIDENCE of its existence. you can color code if you have to. all the space makes it easier to organize (and seriously do write down every step it sucks but it helps)", "There are absolutely resources to help kids. I\u2019m guessing they\u2019ll test you to gauge your grade level on each subject and place you in the appropriate classes. \n\nI believe most public schools in the USA are required to provide programs like IEP and 504. They can allocate resources to you for help you need if you have special needs. \n\nhttps://www.usnews.com/education/k12/articles/504-plan-versus-iep-a-guide-for-parents?context=amp\n\nPlease see if another adult can help you get enrolled in public school. Academic achievement is only one tiny part of an education. You need the social, emotional and physical outlets as well. \n\nNTA. I sincerely hope you\u2019re able to stop homeschooling and grow as a person in a more well rounded way.", "Just wanted to say thank yoi for sharing such ideas and resources for both OP and anyone else reading... you wont know who else you may help and it is a kindness taking time out of your life to do so \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI say, as a 38 yrold woman with little use for upskilling in maths \ud83d\ude06 (but honestly the whiteboard/no evidence concept may assist my adhd brain for brainstorming/planning i desperately need to do).", "oh thank you!!\n\nand yeah i actually had undiagnosed adhd \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43 the whiteboard was SUPER helpful because my brain can\u2019t always keep everything in its head that it needs to? like i would go through and understand the first part i needed to, would go and figure out the other part, and then i kinda forgot and got confused about the first part again and so i couldn\u2019t finish connecting the dots to get the conclusion i needed. so my white board would be filled with the VERY clear explanation of both and that finally helped me connect the dots \u2014 it\u2019s the perfect tool for the adhd working memory"]}
