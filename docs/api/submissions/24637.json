I am a bridesmaid (not MOH) which I understand has it\u2019s own responsibilities.  There are 3 bridesmaids total. I am told it is nonnegotiable to arrive any later than 7am.

My concerns are about leaving the dogs for 11 hours and was wondering if it would truly be that bad if I had to show up 8 hours early instead of 10 hours early so that my dogs will be okay until someone can come get them at 5?

Just show up at 9 am. You\u2019re not going to be kicked out.", "Based on the information provided, NTA.   \n\n\nIt seems the only reason you need to be there that early is to.....keep the bride entertained? Especially if the MOH is there and another bridesmaid, this can be covered. It seems like you are trying to figure things out logistically, and unless there is some information that is being kept from you, it seems very reasonable to arrive at a later moment.  \n\n\nSo when you ask why you need to be there that early, what answer are they giving?", "NTA. Those 'requirements' are ridiculous. \n\nRemember, 'No\" is a complete sentence.", "NAH. Talk to the bride and explain to her why you can\u2019t arrive that early. You also need to assure her that you will not arrive any later than 9am and that you doing your own hair and makeup won\u2019t slow down the process of getting ready. I\u2019ve been in weddings where a bridesmaid said she can do her own hair and it turned out she couldn\u2019t so people had to stop what they were doing to keep her from looking a hot mess. I\u2019ve also been in weddings where people said they would be at the location to get ready at a certain time and they showed up an hour late. If you can assure her that you can be arrive at 9am without adding additional stress on the bride, she should be ok with what you\u2019re proposing.", "NAH.\n\nA 7am call time isn't unheard of in weddings, especially when hair and makeup is a consideration. But in your case, I think it is less about the being there and getting ready aspect but rather being a part of the day and helping with any last minute glitches. \n\nThat being said, it's not unreasonable for you to arrive a bit later if you have pets to consider and are doing your own hair and makeup and will be ready by 2pm when the photographer gets there.", "NTA - There seems to be no reason that you should have to get there at 7am for a wedding that doesn't start until 5pm.", "NTA - your mistake was offering rather than stating when you'd arrive.  \"Sorry, it is what it is.  Would you rather someone take my place?\"", "Certainly NTA.   If you are doing your own hair and makeup, I think 5 hours is plenty of time to accomplish that.  Ridiculous to expect that the 2 hours difference will have any impact on them but it will affect you and your dogs. That is way too long for them to be left alone, \n\nDo you have a family member or friend who the dogs are comfortable with who can take them out around noon time?  If that person is also attending the wedding, it's still plenty of time for him/her to get ready for and travel to the wedding. I would look into that because even if you left at 8 am, 9 hours is still too long for the dogs to be left alone.\n\nAre you able to talk directly to the bride about this unreasonable demand? What's the actual objection to you coming at 9 am?   You will be there for the camaraderie and the pictures, and you are willing to pay for services you will not be receiving, what more do they want from you?    You agreed to be a bridesmaid, that does not make you a minion who must do the couple's bidding \"just because\".", "NTA\n\n\nWhat are you even expected to do for those hours? How many people are getting hair/makeup done that they are coming that early? And pictures don't start until 2? \n\n\nI don't understand the bride and groom wanting to even start that early, after a rehearsal dinner and before a late night? That sounds exhausting. \n\n\nBut you don't say anything about why they want you there at 7.\n\n\nAnd how far off is the wedding? Is this like a 6 months from now thing or a 2 weeks from now?", "NTA - if I were you I\u2019d ask him straight up what exactly it is you will need to be there for, ask him to be specific. If he starts \u2018umm-ing\u2019 say \u2018Right! I\u2019ll see you at 11!\u2019 (For example\u2026)", "He needs to compromise on his unreasonable expectations.", "NTA -- this is way over the top.  I would not be able to enjoy the wedding if I had to get up at that hour.", "NTA - I would turn the questions around. Say, I can't be there until \\~1:30PM (before first known event), what is the impact? What are the actual things that need to happen during that time? \n\nIt is nice you are being there for your brother, but 'demands' are a red flag ... they can make requests, and if they are reasonable then go with them. Being there 7 hours before pictures? Not reasonable.", "NTA, and it sounds like this was very poorly planned.\n\nif there are more than the bride, MOH, and a couple of bridesmaids, there needs to be more than one person doing hair and makeup. Does the woman hired not have assistants/colleagues coming to help? It's insane to expect that at least one or two bridal attendants are going to get their hair and makeup done at 7, 7:30, or 8 AM and have it last late into the night. Even the best bridal hair and makeup isn't that good. If they need SEVEN HOURS to do everyone's hair and makeup, then the person they hired isn't staffed properly.\n\nThis sounds like a nightmare, and you are definitely NTA.", "NAH - it is extremely common for the bridesmaids to have to get up at the asscrack of dawn to start getting ready, its kind of what you signed up for. (And it sucks extra knowing the fellas don't have to, I know!)\n\nI don't think you're being unreasonable asking to show up at 9 if the wedding isn't starting til 5 and you've opted out of makeup.\n\nThe bride likely just wants all of her bridesmaids there to keep her calm, and give her a sense of control on what is likely going to be a hectic day.", "NTA. 10 hours is ridiculous. Even  royal weddings don't require the wedding party to get there 10 hours early.", "ESH. You're right, the schedule's excessive, and I don't see why they couldn't let you come a little later. That said, it's pretty normal for the bridal party to have an early start on the wedding day, and you don't want to be the one member of the wedding party who's difficult or not falling into place. I'm afraid this is what you signed up for.", "Come on dude it's one fucking day. Your only brother's wedding. What kind of notice has he given you?\n\nIdk maybe I'm wrong, but I would absolutely try to put aside my own shit to love my ONLY brother on his wedding day and do what he needed from me. \n\nI am the MOH in a wedding this year and I can't imagine telling my friend I wouldn't show up for her. \n\nI'm saying YTA", "[deleted]", "I think I have to go with NAH because I understand both perspectives here. On one hand, you have a reactive dog  and only one individual who can care for him. On the other, you made a commitment to be in the bridal party which often requires showing up early. Ultimately it is a two hour difference and either party is capable of budging. You can close your dog in a safe room or area where an accident won't cause major damage with his or her favorite things until your former roommate can let him or her out for your only brother's wedding or they can get by without you for a couple hours since it seems you'd be there mostly for support and to get ready.", "Are you ever late to meeting up with them? A friend of mine is notoriously late for almost every single thing, whether it's lunch or a trip abroad. And I don't mean 5-10 minutes. So we (her friends) have started giving her false start times so that she will be on time from now on. Could the early start be because of something like this? If not you maybe another bridesmaid? \n\nHave you spoken to the bride about this as well as your brother? She might have a different opinion on things. \n\nIt does seem unreasonable, but at the end of the day, it's their wedding and it's just one day. Try to make it work. \n\nYou're NTA but i don't think the bride and groom are either.", "YTA. It\u2019s your brother. It\u2019s one day. When you\u2019re a bridesmaid, you follow the schedule given to you by the wedding couple, period. It\u2019s *one* day.", "Leaning towards slight YTA. \n\nIt's common for folks in a wedding party to even stay overnight at the venue (if that's a possibility), and be up very early to start getting ready.  This is not the first wedding I've heard of starting early. \n\nIs it a lot to ask? Yes, but in the scope of weddings it's a 3/10 imo.", "YTA.  Everyone knows that when you commit to the wedding that you have to be there early.  \n\nYou\u2019re fighting about 2 hours.  Just suck it up.  It\u2019s not your day and you agreed to be in the wedding.\n\nYour dogs will be fine for 11 hours.  If they get their food a little early or whatever, they\u2019ll be fine.", "YTA. It's one day and it's your brother's wedding. Yea it's annoying but you're going to be a huge asshole over what is literally a minor inconvenience.", "YTA. Arriving early and spending the entire day getting ready/with the bride is a pretty standard part of being a bridesmaid. If you didn\u2019t want to participate, that\u2019s fine\u2026but you said yes and now it\u2019s pretty crappy of you to not be there.", "YTA\n\nA siblings' wedding where you are a bridesmaid is pretty much a commitment to be there the whole day, if that's what they want.\n\nDoes it suck? Sure.  But you just gotta do it.", "This is over two hours you are talking about? Do it their way,not yours. YTA.", "NTA  No is a complete sentence!", "NTA, look don't bother explaining about your dogs... doesn't really matter. You are an independent adult. If you say what time you will arrive that is a reasonable time for the whole thing, that's it. \nDon't ask permissions. It's ridiculous. That you should be \"denied\". You can't be denied simple. Just inform them about the time you will be arriving...or maybe even don't. I'm sure there will be more delays on the day and you will be like a fool there at 7... Nope. The world doesn't stop for this one wedding.", "NTA and I suggest backing out of the wedding.

Show up with hair and makeup done and you\u2019ll be fine.", "Thanks for the insight! The reason the bride stated beforehand was because that\u2019s when the stylist was showing up for hair and makeup. I\u2019m not very close to the bride so I had asked only my brother if it was okay to show up a bit later if I don\u2019t get my hair done and he\u2019s the one who said \u201cAll bridesmaids are expected to be there by 7:00\u201d, and didn\u2019t give a reason. I suppose I should\u2019ve gone to the bride directly; I just didn\u2019t want to put her in an uncomfortable situation.", "Thanks for the advice! My parents are definitely the people my dogs are most comfortable with and they live nearby. My dad plans to work that day and go straight to the wedding. I did ask my mom; she\u2019s hesitant because she has her own two dogs (one of which is elderly and having incontinence issues) as well as she\u2019ll be caring for my brothers dog. She thinks she\u2019ll be super busy in the morning with those three dogs and getting herself ready for the wedding and still getting there somewhat early to help out. But I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll come around and be able to let them out at some point if I can\u2019t. I\u2019ll start asking around if anyone else is able to come by; thank you! \nI am able to talk directly to the bride but again we\u2019re not very close and she\u2019s pretty shy, I don\u2019t want to put her in an uncomfortable situation where she is afraid to tell me how she feels and then my brother gets caught in the middle too.

Just one woman though that has to do all of it, though, I admittedly don\u2019t know how long it would take. That\u2019s the only reason I was given for needing to arrive at 7.\nThe wedding is in a month and a half, so I do have some time to try and figure something out. I\u2019m just running out of ideas on how to make it work with the dogs.", "This. Especially being clear about the time you are able to attend.", "Yeah that makes sense. Unfortunately they did just miss the cutoff of having an assistant. Just the bride and three bridesmaids. 3-4 hair and two makeup total. I think they required five people in order to validate sending an assistant.", "I was just thinking this!  The numbers don't add up, they should have a main stylist and assistant for makeup, or 1 stylist for just the bride and another for everyone else.", "Completely understood, hence why I made this post. I absolutely want to be there for him, but he won\u2019t even be awake at that hour. He\u2019s not getting ready with his groomsmen until closer to the afternoon. I of course want to be there for the bride even though we\u2019re not close, I just didn\u2019t understand why I couldn\u2019t be an hour or two late due to logistical issues with the dogs and still spend 8 full hours helping the bride get ready", "But she is not bailing on her duties or on the wedding. From the info provided she only needs to be there to be there. If she had things to do, if she had to do her hair or whatever I can understand her presence being required, but she has a valid reason to ask to be a little bit later.   \n\n\nFurthermore she is a ceremonial Bridesmaid, because of her brother, she isn\u00b4t friends with the bride, she isn\u00b4t close to her at all. There are no tasks for her there and some other people are actually there because of their connection to the bride. She also isn\u00b4t asking to be later because she wants to sleep in or doesn\u00b4t feel like it, she has to sort out things for her dog. So asking \"do I really need to be here at 07h already or can I be a bit later so I can organize myself better\" is not unreasonable at all when there is no clear reason given.  \n\n\nPerhaps I am missing something, but I am surprised why she would be the AH for trying to find a compromise that helps her sort herself out.", "I mean, I think they are being unreasonable.\n\nThe photographer will be there at TWO. Being generous it takes, what, 1-2 hours for hair and makeup for a bridesmaid. What in the world do they need to do during this time that it's essential to be there at 7am instead of 9am, as OP requested?\n\nSeriously. Because her reasons are valid. I having flipping dogs! And no one to care for them until 5pm. So, sorry brother, I can't leave my house at 6am. But I can leave at 8am and be there at 9am. What is the issue????", "It being her only brother\u2019s wedding doesn\u2019t magically give her more energy. In order to meet the schedule demanded, she will need to wake up 12 hours before the wedding even starts, and 19 hours before it is expected to end. And frankly I expect that the bride isn\u2019t all that likely to be up and getting ready at 7am either; there\u2019s probably a big margin around that time that OP isn\u2019t being told about, as well as an expectation that the bridesmaids get ready first.", "You showed up 7 hours before pictures?", "Understood, thank you for the response! Though I will say while I do make arrangements for my dogs, it\u2019s always my parents or a close family member that watches them.

I absolutely agree I should spend the whole day with the bride, I just was thrown for a bit of a loop when the day was scheduled to start so early when my experience with other weddings has been so different.", "10 hours is standard?\n\n\n7 hours before pictures?", "i don't think anyone else has mentioned this, so i'll just say-- NTA but from this comment, your brother might have responded that way with the only information he was given, because he knew what his soon-to-be wife said the schedule was and he didn't feel comfortable making a unilateral decision to say you could come later. \n\nif i were you, i'd either tell the bride your situation and ask her yourself, or ask your brother to ask her. then if they're unreasonable and still say no, honestly i'd just show up at 9am or whenever you had planned, if you know it won't affect anyone else's ability to get ready on time.", "Just show up at 12, nothing is happening until 2 anyway\n\nDO NOT ASK PERMISSION\n\nI know you're not a dude but I don't know a better way to say it, you're going to be sitting around all day with your dick in your hand and nobody is going to apologise for massively wasting your time and your dogs' time", "\"Hey, brother, why is 7am non-negotiable?\"\n\n\nBut there are professionals to work with your dogs.

I think I\u2019m in the minority here.   \nIt\u2019s just one day and that is the schedule. All of your complaints are about how the wedding is an inconvenience to you. Your brother\u2019s wedding is his day and you should support that.", "NAH. I was recently a bride and I asked a group of people to be super early for makeup and hair done (they asked for it) and they did show up an hour late, and it was really stressfull because the people I hired did split between hair and makeup, some take longer than others, etc and did push back my time to get ready.   \nMy advice is definitely ask her, maybe her schedule is to start the preparations with the bridesmaids and then other people will be getting ready, so if you ask her then she could swap places and you can even get ready later in the day.   \n\n\nThat's just assuming, maybe not the case. If still she says you should be that early, explain the situation and let her know when you will arrive and stick to it, and have your messages open that day. Maybe she will be a bit mad but if you communicate the outcome will be better", "NTA - Show up at 9am. Yes someone one will get mad but they wont kick you out or anything. \n\nI do hair and makeup for weddings and the start time could be for 7am but trust me not everyone is in the room to get ready and usually start 30-35 mins after the start time.", "NAH\n\nI went to two weddings and last year in the same month, both in the bridal party. The first one I had to be there at 2am and the second one they had me come the night before and we woke up and started getting ready at 5am.\n\nI was really puzzled at first why I had to be there at those times, then I learned it was for the stylist to do my hair and makeup. That only cleared up part of my confusion as in my head, as I wondered why I needed to be there to wait for a few hours for the stylist to get me especially when they're working on one girl, two at most at a given time. Then during one of the weddings while we were waiting, there was so much kerfuffle going on, and shuffling of tasks, the stylists were doing us in different orders based on the other tasks going on. So the situation was really fluid and I realized that me just sitting down and suffering for that time would make it much easier for anyone doing work.\n\nMind you, we also had slightly complicated outfits, one wedding had a saree and that takes time to wrap and pleat correctly like an accordion. But everything else was run of the mill. I personally vetted and hired a cat sitter for my baby for 12 hours, she has medical needs and I know cats don't really need attention but it was unbearable for me to leave her alone (she also had separation anxiety).", "NTA, but you might want to consider boarding the dogs for the day.  Even if you arrive at 9am, you said the wedding will go until at least Midnight.  That's at least 15 hours for the dogs to be stuck inside. \n\nI know it's a pain in the neck and expensive, but please consider dropping the dogs off at the doggy hotel & spa the day before (or drop them off when the kennel opens that morning and go straight to the venue) and picking them up the morning after.", "7hrs early?! Told last minute. NTA.  I\u2019d be fed up and want to leave before the wedding even started.", "Yes, 0700 isn't some alien time plenty of people manage to be function members of society at that time everyday. You agreed Ed to be in the wedding knowing the people involved. Somethimes as an adult you agree to do things you later regret but part of being an adult is sucking it up and dealing with it.", "Right?! Denied. What a joke. I\u2019d be denying him just about everything for the rest of our lives. \u201cPass the salt\u201d \u201cdenied\u201d", "And if she is kicked out.... good riddance", "I would tell them though. \"I am showing up at 9, no earlier, and if that is unacceptable then I am ok bowing out of the bridal party\". Yeah, they'll be upset beforehand instead of just the day of, but stand in your truth and your boundaries.", "Thank you for the perspective! Super helpful to hear from someone whose bridesmaids were in a similar situation. I\u2019d hate to stress her out by just arriving late without communication. I\u2019ll talk to her!", "I appreciate the concern! I actually do have a trusted former roommate coming at 5pm to feed them and play with them a bit and let them out. So ideally they\u2019d be alone 8ish-5ish which is standard with my work schedule. My roommate will feed and play with them from 5-6 or 7 and then they\u2019ll be alone again until 1am. Not ideal of course but the best I could arrange for one day. Unfortunately boarding isn\u2019t an option due to my big dog\u2019s reactivity.", "I completely understand! As in my post, I have no issue waking up early. I would wake up earlier for work every day without issue. The trouble is leaving the pets alone for 11 hours. Thanks!", "My brother's wife and her family were really into the wedding. I showed up at 7am as instructed, and half the bridesmaids weren't there until an hour or two later.\n\nThat said, my brother was panicked the whole time and wouldn't work to make any allowances for our family. Like, I couldn't get to my backpack until 9pm because he didn't want to ask her folks to open the house, and I had left it there after prep. (Couldn't take it to the church without embarrassing him). But my brother is a bit of an asshole and with the anxiety he was just a nightmare.  \n\nSo I'd ask the bride or her family about anything,  as long as I could make it look like I wasn't avoiding asking my brother.\n\nIt sounds like you are closer to your brother, luckily.", "I have a reactive dog too. Yeah, it's a lot of work. NTA for not showing up either way, but are all the people you trust with them needed for the 7am arrival time? If not, I wonder if they could stop by on the way"]}
