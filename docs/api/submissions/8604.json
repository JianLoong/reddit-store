Cooking, cleaning, groceries, dealing with any household issues, mail, taking my mum to any doctor/hospital appointments etc\nI love my mum, I don't have a single friend and I don't get along with my sister so my mum is all I have. \n\nBut she acts like a child. She's gotten coddled a lot from my aunts so even though she's capable of doing so many things, she's gotten to used a lifestyle of laziness. All she does is watch TV and take naps, but she's so young, not even 50! \nI've gotten a little stressed in the past year, regarding my future and how unhappy I am with my life currently, and for the past 6 months, I've gotten into disordered eating habits and binging. This leads to my mum commenting on my weight and appearance which leads me to getting stressed and then binging and the cycle continues. I cry every night almost every day haha lol\n\nI'm so desperate to move out and live by myself. I know I'm not going to be able to move out for quite a long time, mostly likely for the next 10 years.\n\nI'm told to be quite frugal and I don't think I'll ever have a romantic partner so it'll just be and my cat in a home thats the bare minimum. That's all I want really, to just live in a decently sized home with a job that pays me enough to survive. I currently work a retail part time job and I'm going to start an undergraduate course in psychology this September. I have 12k in savings and I live in the UK.\n\nI won't move out anytime soon because I don't have the money. But I was wondering if I'd be an asshole for moving out in the future, knowing my mother might struggle with certain things. My little sister will be there and she's 3 years younger than me so when I do move out, she'll be in her 20s so she could theoretically do everything I'm doing now.\n\nEdit: I've looked into a carer but mum doesn't meet the requirements and will have to pay out of pocket, roughly \u00a3100 a week and we're a low income family so we can't afford that. And I can't apply for a young carers allowance due to my hours at my part time job and because I'll be in university this year.\nWe don't have any family that live in our area to help and I really poorly phrased this in my original, but no I don't expect my younger sister to do what I'm doing now in the future because then she'll be miserable as well.

As this is the UK, i\u2019m sure there are plenty of homecare type options for your mom. You have a right to live for yourself.", "NTA - you are the child, not the mother.  If your mother has not been officially declared disabled then this needs to happen ASAP.  This will allow your mother access to extra help to give you a break.  I would also enlist the aunts to give you breaks for at least one weekend a month.\n\nYou also need to start taking time for yourself, gym membership or just starting by taking long power walks.", "NTA\n\nBeing a caretaker is extremely draining at the best of times.  And you're only 19, just starting out your life.  Honestly, it sounds like you're already suffering from caretaker burnout which is extremely common.\n\nThe fact that your mother has been coddled by other family members just makes it worse.  If they want to coddle her, they can do the caretaking, or all chip in to hire someone.  \n\nEven people who take care of their parents have hired help.  Nobody can be a caretaker 24/7/365.  But that's what everyone else expects you to do.\n\nHonestly, I'd move out ASAP here.  Doesn't matter if your mom is all you have.  Find some service that will take care of her.  You can be her advocate.\n\nAnd if any flying monkeys (i.e. other family members) give you a hard time, remember **they are not the ones being asked to sacrifice literally their entire lives to take care of her**.", "NTA.

I\u2019m older than you, and I\u2019ve created boundaries that work for both of us, it just took time.", "NTA but please do not expect your sister to take your place and have her life turn to misery in return. Caring for your parents is a lovely action, personally for me is a duty - but not at the expense of your own happiness and life. Think of options to have your mother in care or splitting the duties with your sister or other family members. \nWhether you move out or not, boundaries are very much needed, especially since it sounds you're being emotionally abused.", "NTA. Well done on saving so much from your part time job. \n\nKeep saving and don't let any your family know about it, you deserve a good life for yourself. I think getting her some at home care would be a good start to atleast tale the pressure off you a bit.\n\nDepending on where you are. Depending on where you are in the UK that might be enough for a good chunk of a deposit if you want to buy.  Maybe look into lifetime isa etc.", "NTA Being a full time caregiver of someone is stressful and you deserve to enjoy yourself, have a social life, and plan your future. If she is able to care for herself somewhat take the time for yourself that you need. It is unfair for your mom to expect you to be her nurse for the foreseeable future.", "NTA. Move out and live an amazing and beautiful life. This world is meant to be enjoyed and there are so many beautiful and interesting people out there waiting for you to meet them.", "NTA. I know it\u2019s a lot of pressure but you have your own life, and just because she is your mother and gave birth to you doesn\u2019t mean she should be able to hold you or your sister back. You\u2019re allowed to set boundaries and move on, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll never ever see her again! For all you know it may make your relationship less strained.", "NTA.  If your mother is able to have a coherent conversation, she is able to talk to her doctor's office and ask if they know of any volunteer services that will come by to assist her on a scheduled basis.  If her income does not allow financial aid requirements, go online, see how others manage to tackle this.  Ask organizations who do this work about volunteer groups.  \n\nYour mom's care should not be on either you or your sister IMO.  You were not raised to be a parent's caretaker.\n\nAs you continue your education, you may have less time to help care for your mother.\n\nIf your mother is now refusing to do anything for herself (you write she has become lazy) then perhaps it is time for you to discuss this with her doctor.  I'd tell mom \"I am going to be very busy with school and study, if you can't do simple care tasks for yourself by now, we need to notify doctor, maybe it is time for another evaluation and maybe doctor feels you should be put in care facility\".  \n\nAs far as you having no social life, no wonder since your teen years have been spent as a caretaker and going to school.  You need to bust out of that mold you have created for yourself.  Some people are natural loners and that is just fine.  \n\nNO ONE knows the future; you may end up with a partner, you may not, you may find that you prefer your own company and living single works best for you.\n\nThe thing you NEED to do is stay quiet about your savings to everyone (not sister, not a close friend, no one!).  Continue to study.  Continue to save.", "NTA. You are an adult and have every right to move out as you wish.

Please.", "NTA you\u2019re in a very difficult position and are entitled to want to strike out and live your life. \n\nYour mum\u2019s GP should be able to help you access support services (although they can\u2019t discuss your mum with you, they can listen to you and any concerns you have about her health) and/or refer your mum to social services who should be able to do an assessment of your mums current support needs. Contact your own GP for support for yourself as you are burnt out\n\nThe Carers Trust provide help and support for carers in the UK. https://carers.org/about-us/about-carers-trust.

NTA either way, but how disabled is she?", "If you're in the UK and your mum is disabled enough to get certain benefits (ESA is the main one) she might be entitled to care from your local council authority. It's called a personal health budget, and it can be spent on carers. You could also contact the Stroke Association and see what support there is in your area. You can also check with Carers.org to see what there is for young carers (25yrs and under) in your area. As others have suggested, see what Student Services at your university can suggest too.\n\nDO NOT TELL YOUR FAMILY ABOUT YOUR SAVINGS. They are clearly very skilled in making you feel guilty, isolating you and treating you like a maid. If they know you've got any money it'll all be spent before you know what's happening.

I'll look into organisations that can help. And yes, I haven't told anyone about my savings. My dad (my parents are divorced) frequently ask but I don't say a clear answer because he might ask to \"borrow\" some.\n\nI think the whole \"child looking after a parent\" is a cultural thing that is really hard to break out of. We're from a south Asian background, and in our culture, its the norm and literally expected of you, especially if you're a daughter, to take care of your parents when they're not able to.

I don't earn that much most of the time, but because I sometimes do overtime at work, I do, so still don't qualify. You also don't qualify if you're a fulltime student and because I'm going to univeristy this September, I don't qualify for this reason as well.", "Yes but your parents divorcing isn\u2019t part of your culture either. Tell your dad or family members how overwhelming it is and that you need help. If they can\u2019t maybe they can get some money together to help? I would also make sure your mom\u2019s health is ok too. You have to advocate for her, this is a huge responsibility and you are so young, sorry you are in this position. Your family, especially her side needs to help you. If your dad can\u2019t be trusted maybe asking some other people in his family for help especially if he was the reason for the divorce."]}
