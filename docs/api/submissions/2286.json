It was only in my teens I learned he was my grandmother's second husband. He had a child and grandkid of his own, and never treated us any different.

She doesn't even sound interested in reforming her behavior toward Evan, *even* in a completely self-serving way, to see your daughter - I notice she cried about wanting to see your daughter, apologized to *you* and said she loved *you*, but absolutely zero about Evan.

Add to that the fact that Family Court Judges enjoy a greater amount of autonomy in their decisions, and it makes for a dangerous situation for parents trying to protect their children from toxic relatives.  Often, unlike in civil or criminal courts, the only way to retry a case is to go back in front of the same judge.\n\nA glaring example is \"third party visitation\" laws.  An expansion of GPR that allows anyone (typically relatives but not necessarily so) who thinks it is \"in the best interest of the child\" to have a relationship with a child regardless of the parents' wishes, to sue for visitation.  Yes, this is allowed in some states, and it is frightening as anything."]}
