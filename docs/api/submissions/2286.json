The fallout of that kind of favoritism, the kind that's blatant and severe, would be just terrible for everyone in your family.", "NTA. She's treated your son with distaste.

Don't give in to her manipulation!\n\nGoing through the comments, I see some people suggesting counselling. That's a good idea. Make sure she's ACTUALLY remorseful before you let her see her granddaughter.", "NTA - How is she going to treat Evan going forward? Did she apologize for how she treated him?", "ESH if she didn't feel the spark for your son than she didn't feel it. She could have faked it better but it still would have been fake. You could tell her she has to try harder but it does seem pretty cruel especially as it seems like you have a small family.\n\nThis sub is hypocritical though. If some 14 year-old girl had a single father that got married and adopted his wife's kid they wouldn't be telling her how she has to accept her new family or that because her dad adopted the kid that they are siblings and have to love each other.", "NTA. However, if she is an apologetic, perhaps she would accept your son now?  I suggest counselling for her, possibly with you.", "Nta\nEven in her begging is there no apology or efforts to change.", "Sounds like mom is ripe for a change of heart. There\u2019s a pervasive myth that adopting a child leads to pregnancy. You could let your mom know that the doctor told you Evan is the only reason your mother has a biologically related grandchild. I know it\u2019s not the most honest thing to do, but I\u2019m all for lies that bring families together. Estrangement is worse for everyone.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. You know if you let her in your life, and that of your children, she's going to make Evan's life a misery by playing favorites with your daughter, making a fuss of and spoiling her because she's a biological grandchild. He already knows his grandmother doesn't approve of him, the last thing he needs is her rubbing his face in the fact she has a grandchild to spoil.", "Nta she made her bed, she needs to lay in it. It would be bad for the kids and their relationship", "NTA", "NTA  she will discriminate in her treatment between your children and cause division and rejection. You are in the right here  anyone eho could look at your child with distaste should not be near children.", "NTA\n\nShe apologized to you? How about your son? You didn't mention anything so then she really wasn't apologetic at all? No promises to do apologize to him & to do better? Nah, even she did, it wouldn't be sincere.", "Nope. You're not the asshole. Mom has proven over five years that she's not a safe person to have around your son. I can only imagine how awful it would be to have her come over and praise the baby while ignoring your son. She doesn't want to see her just one time. She wants to give all the love she held back from your son to your little girl. That's not healthy. Until she can change her ways, no need to involve her in this child's life.", "NTA.\n\nDNA definitely does not matter. My sister and brother-in-law are currently fostering a baby girl since she was 3 months old (turning 2 years old this week) with the intent to adopt, and since the moment we found out about her, even while we were waiting for my sister and BIL to be approved to be her foster parents, she became a member of our family. She is their daughter, she is my niece, she is my parents\u2019 granddaughter. It doesn\u2019t even matter that our other sister has 4 bio kids, she is treated just the same as my older nibblings. Her cousins adore her. She loves her \u201chappa\u201d (my nibblings\u2019 name for my dad, their grandfather). She calls out for her cousins when she sees them and loves to play with them. We have never treated her as an outsider. I even tell her how much she is like her mom, referring to my sister, not the bio mom. And we know the bio mom, so I know what I\u2019m talking about (I love the bio mom, but she\u2019s trash and does not take care of any of her kids, but keeps birthing them).\n\nJust keep loving on your son and protect him from toxic people who don\u2019t appreciate how wonderful he is and what a delight it is to have him be a part of your family. Your mom is already treating your kids differently and she will continue to do so if you let her in their lives. Don\u2019t fall for her guilt trips. She had her chance and blew it", "She cried? I thought witches melted when they got wet.\n\nNTA, unless you let her see your daughter. Your first obligation is to your children. That woman openly rejected a baby because he wasn\u2019t blood related. She\u2019s absurdly small minded and cruel and should not be trusted around your children. Who\u2019s to say she wouldn\u2019t secretly treat your daughter like a queen and your son like dirt, or try to teach your daughter that her brother wasn\u2019t her \u201creal\u201d family? She doesn\u2019t deserve to be a grandmother and it\u2019s her own damn fault that she ended up alone. Don\u2019t buy into those tears for a second.", "NTA She effed around and she found out. If she didn't make those bad decisions she would be visiting her new grandbaby now.", "She is regretful and apologetic only insofar as it relates to your daughter and not having a relationship with her. Not for her behaviour to your son. She cannot even keep the distain off her face for your son - which is an appalling way to behave towards a child. He has done nothing to deserve that behaviour and if you let your mother into your lives it  will invariably cause him harm. That is more important than her wants as they relate to your other child. NTA.", "NTA - but if your daughter decides that she wants to meet her grandma one day, you should allow her to. i had a really weird family situation similar to this one growing up, and it really fucked me up to not even know that my other grandma lived in my hometown for 16 years because of animosity between other family members that really did not pertain to me at all. your daughter may make the choice to meet her one day, and she has the right to make that choice herself. but for now, you are doing the right thing. you are not only protecting and advocating for your son, you are also setting boundaries for your mother. her apology to you shows that she doesn\u2019t care about Evan, as she only apologized to you, and did not even mention the impact that it would have on him if he had heard her say something like that, or the clear favoritism that would be evident if Evan and your daughter ever spend time around your mom together. well done.", "Nta but it could feel different if a child is bloodrelated,she doesnt need to show it though. She should show your son some decent respect and shouldnt make him feel unwanted", "She blew it with grandchild #1, why should she get the opportunity with grandchild #2? NTA", "NTA and idk your mother so forgive me if What I'm suggesting just wouldn't work based on her personality but I feel like you're being a bit harsh by adopting a punishment rather than solutions based approach. I understand that it's been 4 years (?) since you adopted your Evan that your mother has neglected him but maybe figure out a way in which she can prove that she deserves to see her granddaughter. \n\nOf course her actions are really stupid but it doesn't sound like she's done irreparable damage. Try and work things out.", "YTA. You and your husband are forcing your mother to accept a non bio kid when she is clearly not ready for that. Then, you are punishing her by denying access to her bio grand kid for not accepting a non bio grand kid which was your decision to make, not hers. This is abusive behavior on your part.\nThere is a lot of support for children who do not accept their non bio parents/stepparents and siblings? How is your mother different from those kids ?", "Esh seems like you want to punish your mom for not living up to your expectations. Unfortunately we're all just human with all the good and bad that comes with that.", "Second all of this! And if you ever waiver, then draw up a list of actions dear mamma must complete (family therapy should be high on the list) before any meeting with BOTH grandchildren can occur.", "And don't fall for the 'it's her only grandbaby' guilt stuff. Your son became her grandbaby the moment you adopted him. I get heated up about this, because the grandparent I was closest to was my step-grandfather. We shared no blood, but I loved him and he always showed me he loved me too. He taught me how to brew coffee and how not to dive (he belly flopped all the time) and how to build a campfire and how to make stuffed peppers and how to swim in the ocean and a hundred other things I treasure now. It was only in my teens I learned he was my grandmother's second husband. He had a child and grandkid of his own, and never treated us any different. If your mom can't find room in her heart to love and cherish your son, then she doesn't deserve your daughter. Your son and daughter deserve better than her.", "We have higher expectations for adults then we do children, especially when it's about showing love to children. What might be an uncomfortable NAH when dealing with a 14 year old can be an Easy YTA with a 63 year old.", "Moms an adult these are children. Big difference. Mom doesn\u2019t have to be all cuddles but she could be kind to Evan instead of making faces.", "Exactly how is it abusive. Her mother doesn't consider the adopted boy her family and the parents are very keen on the idea that they, Evan, and baby girl are all a family even with out all sharing chromosomal pairs. They are not an either or, but a package deal. And Mom made it clear that even if she said she would change would always feel that Evan was lesser which is a great way to screw up a kid. So she gets nothing.", "I love this \u2764\ufe0f my grandpa (gran's second husband - she remarried before I was born) taught me woodworking and used to make toys for local kids in the neighbourhood. I knew from an early age he wasn't a blood relative but there was never any question of thinking of him as step-anything.", "The people who chose to love you make the biggest impact on your life, imo. And I've always thought forgetting to included the 'step' was the biggest honor I could give. He was my grandpa. No additions or qualifiers."]}
