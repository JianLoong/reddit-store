You're not an asshole for setting boundaries for yourself.", "NAH. Do you live together? Is she able to get independent living services where you live? Maybe she, or you, can call DSS where you live and ask about services for individuals for autism. Depending on where you live, you both could be eligible for services where the goal is to ensure you both are as independent as possible in the community. If she had these services, her direct support provider could work with her on the inappropriateness of eating non-food items and take that burden off your shoulders.", "Then stop laughing at it", "She really needs to see a therapist to treat her for that behavior. Such behavior is pathological.", "YTA\n\nYou either think this is funny and keep laughing OR you realize this is crazy behavior and sternly tell her to stop.\n\nYou say you thought you were getting an adult but she\u2019s acting like a child. Well, if you laugh at something a child does, they think it\u2019s okay. \n\nSo, if you want it to stop YOU have to act like and adult and say \u2018this isn\u2019t funny. Either this is a joke or a serious mental issue.

It sounds like she is just joking with you, especially since you find it funny and laugh every time.  I don't think there's any harm in joking around with your partner.

Pay better attention to your partners needs.", "NTA.  You want an adult partner and friend, not someone who needs to be babysat.  How boring!\n\nMaybe you should inform your GF very bluntly that you will no longer get involved with her imbibing those substances.  If she ends up sick or whatever, that is on her.  If your GF has a counselor, or caretaker, or someone who is legally involved in her life, you may want to inform that person also.\n\n1) You have observed this behavior and stopped it several times.\n\n2) You no longer want to feel responsible for this person who is legally an adult.\n\nIf she really does have Pica (a compulsion to eat non-food items) she may need professional care.
