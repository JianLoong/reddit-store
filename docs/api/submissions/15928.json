While I love birds and have actually recently got into bird watching, I think this is a great humane compromise. You shared with him how you felt. (Sounds like you did it respectfully) Obviously he can\u2019t/won\u2019t move it, that\u2019s ok too. Even with my new found hobby, if my vehicle was getting pooped on, I DEFINITELY would be making changes. It\u2019s not fair for the neighbor to expect you to have to deal with the consequences of him having such a massive bird feeder. I think you did all the right steps.", "NTA\n\nIt's your property, you can put whatever you'd like on it, just as he can with his bird feeders.", "NTA.

I bet after a while more birds will return to the feeder.", "As someone who has to deal with neighbors feeding birds ( WHO BY THE WAY WILL BE JUST FINE IF NO ONE FEEDS THEM), I say you are NTA!

Took feeder into garage nightly- mice showed up. Humane mouse trap- fewer mice but black snake in garage closet (surprise!). Finally- secure metal can for bird feeder in the garage every night. It took us several months to work through this food chain and solve it.", "And here I thought raccoons just liked the idea of washing their food :^)", "If you fill with thistle seed, it'll only attract birds (well maybe mice also)", "That reminds me of [this.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rfbb4yRBH64)", "Nope, NTA.

His feeding station may be a violation.  \n\n(PS - Before anyone asks, we were told the basketball hoop had to go because it could interfer with firefighter operations in the event of a house fire.  Needed to maintain a clear 10-foot strip between the structure and the property line.  Found this out when we went to sell the house - previous owners put it in and never got it permitted.  It was centered between the garage and the fence.)", "Agree to let the feeder stay ... just as long as he pays for your vehicle to be maintained.

The neighborhood birds used to gather on the power line out front of my parent's house, right above where my mom parks her car (on the street). My dad tried one of those things that emits a high pitched noise, but that wasn't super effective, so he got those strips and hung them on the power line (probably not the best idea, but he did it).
