He has the right to put a bird feeder on his property and you have the right to install bird scaring strips.  I wouldnt want tons of bird shit all over my car either.  \n\nI dont beleive your neighbor deliberately put in a feeder so they would shit all over your car as it sounds like he had genuine reasons to attract them.  But there was an unexpected result and you took the necessary means to stop your car from getting covered.  NTA", "NTA. While I love birds and have actually recently got into bird watching, I think this is a great humane compromise. You shared with him how you felt. (Sounds like you did it respectfully) Obviously he can\u2019t/won\u2019t move it, that\u2019s ok too. Even with my new found hobby, if my vehicle was getting pooped on, I DEFINITELY would be making changes. It\u2019s not fair for the neighbor to expect you to have to deal with the consequences of him having such a massive bird feeder. I think you did all the right steps.", "NTA\n\nIt's your property, you can put whatever you'd like on it, just as he can with his bird feeders.", "NTA. Get mice traps for your carport too because where there are bird feeders, rodents soon follow.", "NTA. Bird poop can damage paint, plus the added time and expense for cleaning.\n\nHe can pay to have someone clean your car daily, pay to move his feeder, or live with the strips.", "NTA, your property your choice. It\u2019s none of his business.", "NTA, \"Oh no I don't get to see as many birds while I'm working. This is clearly more important than OPs car.\" Lmao. I probably would have gone further than just bird scaring strips.", "NTA, but how is bird poop flying under your carport onto your car? \n\nOr maybe I have a different idea what what a \"carport\" is: in my experience it's a open drive with a cover/roof.", "NTA I like feeding the birds, and so do most of our neighbors. I do not like the poop. I bet after a while more birds will return to the feeder.", "As someone who has to deal with neighbors feeding birds ( WHO BY THE WAY WILL BE JUST FINE IF NO ONE FEEDS THEM), I say you are NTA! Your clean car is more important than his entertainment of watching birds. He could put a YouTube video on loop of birds if he loves them much", "NAH you agreed it's hard for him to move it, but there are still birds coming. Win win.", "NTA. He has a right to put a bird feeder wherever he wants on his property, but you have a right to protect you property from damage by the wildlife his feeder is attracting.", "NTA Your the AH? What about your neighbor? He's the AH. The least he can do is come and wash your car for you everyday. What do they say? Turn about is fair play.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSounds like a reasonable solution.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Kind of funny.", "There is a roof but no walls. The birds were landing on the mirror, so there was always poop down the mirror.
