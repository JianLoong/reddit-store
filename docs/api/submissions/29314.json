What an asshole. \n\nNTA", "NTA. 24\u00b0C is already way too warm and she wants more than that? It is easier to warm up when cold than cool down when hot.

Your roomie needs to put more clothes on.", "NTA. Where is she from, though? That does make a difference (but you're NTA anyway).\n\nI come from South America, and in the region where I lived, 24\u00b0C is \"get the jackets out of the closet\" time, as it's 30\u00b0C for most of the year (40\u00b0C in the summer). Now that I live in the northern hemisphere, 24\u00b0C is warm XD. So it's all relative. But even in South America, no one is \"freezing\" at 24\u00b0C, this is overly dramatic.\n\nBut relative or not, it makes more sense for her to wear layers than for your water bill to increase and for you to take 3 or 4 showers a day.", "NTA. 24 is disgustingly warm. It\u2019s always easier to make yourself warmer than cooler. You can easily add clothing and blankets, but you can\u2019t take off layers of skin.", "NTA. I have issues regulating my body temperature so I'm frequently cold. But above 20\u00b0C is bloody madness! Of its at 20\u00b0C and I'm cold, I put a dressing gown and thick pjs on", "NTA, 24 is way too hot. \n\nMy roommate was the same, she turned the heat to the maximum in every rooms of the apartment.

Also putting on a sweater or blanket is waaay easier than you taking multiple showers a day. That you be super wasteful AND bad for your skin. Your roommate is totally unreasonable!", "Umm, wow. 24? Comfortable sleep temperature for me is 19-20. I'd be sweating like a pig at 24. Blankets are really effective at making a cold room feel warmer. However, there's no way to make it feel colder once all the sheets/blankets are off. NTA.", "NTA I would be begging you to turn it DOWN.", "Omg that makes me sweat just thinking about. NTA. But your roommate surely has medical stuff making them so cold. Perhaps arthritis? People with arthritis are often colder.

She can wear sweaters and use extra blankets, but there\u2019s not much you can do to cool down.", "So she wants you to take multiple showers a day just because she doesn\u2019t want to wear a jumper? It\u2019s easier to put clothing on than it is to strip down when it\u2019s too hot. Her \u201csolution\u201d is quite stupid because it will waste so much water and time.

I don't even have my house that high during the day let alone when I sleep (below 20) I would be sweating through my sheets and unable to sleep.

That is the logical solution here.", "Nta. Im used to very warm temperatures at home. Warmer then all others I know. And its 22\u00b0. Everyone else's home is colder. 22\u00b0 without wind is perfectly fine to just wear underwear and a wide shirt. When she is cold maybe she should check if she is ill or has some temperature reglemantation issues or some malfunctions.", "She's in the wrong, for sure.  That's normal-to-warm room temp.  \n\n(If I were super close to this person I'd suggest they talk to their doc - they may be anemic.)", "I keep my thermostat at 20 degrees Celsius at the HIGHEST.

You can very much vary the temperature per room by opening/closing vents and opening/closing doors and opening/closing windows. \n\nAlso, has she tried a small space heater? There are very safe and efficient ones out there.", "Which is roughly 75 degrees farenheight, which is uncomfortably warm for me. \n\nThe solution is simple: the person who is colder puts on more clothes.", "From the US so I also had to google to know the temp and this is way too warm to keep the thermostat. In the dead of winter mine is at 68 or 69 degrees, so 20 celsius. NTA and she should put a sweater on or talk to her doctor about why she's so cold all the time.", "24 degrees, holy eff. Both of you need to acclimatize to normal temps", "24 degrees Celsius???? That\u2019s boiling \ud83d\ude05NTA", "Wtf. 24 degrees is fucking wastefull and hot af. If she can't survive at actual room temperature she best get in touch with a doctor asap.\n\nNTA", "That's about 75F no way is anyone freezing. Put on a sweater. I'm also a Dad, don't touch the thermostat. She may be anemic.", "NTA 24c is mental, if it's above 20c I'm uncomfortable. Is she ill maybe and doesn't know it?

You\u2019re both insane if you think that\u2019s comfortable, and especially if she thinks it\u2019s cold! Genuinely, she needs to see a doctor.", "NTA. WTF, per Google that's 75 in real degrees. That's warmer than a lot of people keep it.", "NTA. I don't even get it, if you were my roommate, I'd tell you to never set it higher than 22\u00b0C ever. My current apartment is on the colder side, I adapted by wearing long underwear. I never sleep with the heater on.", "I'd personally rip the thermostat out of the wall if someone turned it to 75.", "NTA. It is far easier to warm up than it is to cool down. 24 degrees is above normal room temperature, if she is freezing at that temperature she either needs to wear more or thicker layers or go to the doctor to make sure she doesn't have a medical condition that would make her unable to regulate her body temp.\n\n(Side note: I couldn't imagine living at 24 degrees. 22 in winter would be the highest I would go and it would have to be a really cold day lol).", "NTA, 24 is balmy!

We're wishing for AC in that.\n\nI keep my house at 64 (18C) in the winter.", "NTA\n\nYour roommate is at least 24 degrees above freezing. I think 24C is a little on the warm side, but that is me. Maybe she should get a small space heater or a heated blanket, or a warm cup of shut up and deal with it. I mean, is she prancing around in no clothes or something? Throw on another layer and deal with it. I love it when it is a little chilly and I can curl up in a warm blanket. Maybe some exercise to get her blood pumping with help warm her up a bit.", "NTA\n\n24 is quite warm and your bill must be astronomical ! Anyways it\u2019s easier to put a sweater on than cool off if you\u2019re already in a tshirt - not like you can remove your skin.", "NTA. 24\u00b0C is pretty warm.

If she's 'freezing\" at 24C, I would suggest she's goes to a doctor to see if she's anaemic or something. \n\nAlso, it's ridiculous that she expects you to have a cold shower every time you get hot.
