How OP and her partner deal with money in their relationship is none of Mike business and should not impact him.\n\nThis is mainly poor communication.", "Yes, them splitting it 3 ways instead of 5 is exactly the issue I\u2019m discussing. That\u2019s not a given or an immutable characteristic of gift giving. The gift itself is clearly from the partners as well. No idea where you\u2019re finding that distinction. I get why Mike wouldn\u2019t be into the gift being \u201cfrom\u201d some people but *from* other people.", "If I go on vacation with a group, we don\u2019t charge single people and couples the same dollar amount, it\u2019s split per person.", "We like our brothers girlfriend, she is a very sweet girl.\nAnd our brother does not have a problem paying that amount of money, of course i do not know his exact finances, but i know what he can afford. \nHe also knew beforehand how much the gift would cost in total and with the deal i found it is actually 200 bucks less (in total) than we expected. So If he could not afford it he would not have agreed to the gift to begin with.", "Thanks for proving my point about the holidays downvoters!", "> Well that's a problem between bro and his GF ?\n\nBro has made the unilateral executive decision that *he's not asking his GF for her opinion on this*.  It would be extra, extra shitty for her to suddenly realize at the party that not only is her name the only one not on the card, but that she could have had her name on the card except that Bro decided not to even bring it up.\n\n> I can understand bro not being comfortable having to ask his gf to pitch in an extensive gift when it will be the first holidays they spend together.\n\nThe \"expensive gift\" is, from her perspective, $50.  Or it would be, if Bro weren't gatekeeping his GF's money for her and making decisions on her behalf.  IDK, $50 is a lot for some people, but it's not a lot for other people, and GF's choices have been made for her by Bro.  Bro is a full-on jackoff here, and your \"solution\" is not for OP to tell Bro to actually, y'know, not spend or refuse to spend GF's money for her, and to talk to his GF, but instead to ice out GF without any kind of conversation.", "People who are stuck living with their mothers usually can't just drop $100 on a gift for somebody.", "This has already been answered prior to your comment.", "Well bro said they \"agreed not to do anything big\". Maybe they agreed not to offer gifts to family members. I think we don't know enough to make assumption about how things are between bro and his Gf.\n\nWe only now they are a recent couple. His sisters' are not, and Sis said Their SO were pitching in. Gf is not. If officially five people are pitching in, then the cost should be split in five. Whether the sisters are making their SO reimburse them or not is not relevant because it is their choice. If they didn't want the cost to be split in five they should have said it was a sibling gift.\n\nMaybe Bro is a jerk to his Gf, but OP doesn't care about the GF since she doesn't ask what Gf thinks, like you suggest. She's just pissed because bro said no to her payment plan. So it is, at best, ESH.", "He lives there because his university is right around the corner.\nAnd I repeat: He agreed beforehand knowing that it would likely cost about 150 bucks, i even found a better deal.", "And I didn't read through all the comments, they posted on a public forum and I'm entitled to ask for info just like everyone else", "> She's just pissed because bro said no to her payment plan.\n\nI don't see pissivity anywhere in the OP.  I see OP leaving Bro's name off the card if Bro doesn't pay his way.  3 siblings, the price is split 3 ways.  Bro and GF can split (or not) their $100 any way they choose, just as OP and Sis are doing with their partners.  That's completely fair.\n\nThat you see \"well, no $$$ no name on card\" and read it as \"OMG OP IS SO PISSED\" makes me worry for you.  Like, is your home life OK?", "So he lives with mom and attends university... which to me doesn't sound like someone who has a lot of cash laying around.", "If everyone asks the same question without seeing if that questions already been answered, we aren\u2019t asking informed questions, are we?", "He has a degree in design and works at the university part time + plus does freelancer stuff while getting another degree. I can assure you he is not the broke college student you make him out to be.\nAlso i repeat (again) he knew beforehand how much the gift would likely cost and agreed.", "Oh also where we live you pay like 3k for a degree (first one was paid by an inheritance anyway). So there is also no \"crippling student debt\" to take care of."]}
