But\u2026the sisters always tack their SO\u2019s onto the card, making a gift that was cost split three ways actually a gift from 5 people, meaning they get to piggyback their SO without increasing their outlay.

The siblings and SOs go in together on a gift and split it by the number of people at the time.
