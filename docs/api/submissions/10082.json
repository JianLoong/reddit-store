I am the last one out of the house in the morning, so I have never minded this arrangement.\n\nThe problem is one of my roommates, \"Val\" constantly interrupts my showers to use the bathroom. We have been living in the house since August, and I would say she does it at least once a week, but usually 2-3 times a week. A few minutes into my shower, she will knock on the door and tell me to hurry up because she needs to use the bathroom. She only does this to me, not to any of the other girls.\n\nMy first response to this was to vary the time I take showers. I was normally taking them between 9:30 and 10 pm, so I started taking them closer to 10:30. I figured that she probably just had a routine and my shower fell in the middle of it. However, doing so did nothing. She still kept knocking on the door and asking me to hurry up because she needs to use the bathroom.\n\nI suggested to her that she take the later slot since her body was in a routine that required using the bathroom later in the day, but she insisted that she is asleep by 9:30 so she can't wait that long.\n\nFor a bit, my classes were getting out before she was getting home, so I just started showering at 3 pm to avoid the constant interruptions. Mind you, I typically shower for 10-15 mins, never too long.\n\nMy class schedule changed again about 3 weeks ago, resulting in me taking the last shower at night again. She has interrupted me a total of 11 times in 3 weeks. On Tuesday, she interrupted me again. I had been in the shower for \\~ 2 minutes at that point and she was BEGGING me to stop my shower to let her use the bathroom, so I did. When she finished, I went back and finished my shower and I heard her complaining to my other roommate that I am rude because I look pissed off when she asks.\n\nYesterday, I purposely waited until she turned off her bedroom light before starting my shower. I was maybe 5 minutes in when I heard her banging on the door. I had a long day and was really stressed, and just wanted to enjoy my freezing cold shower since there is never hot water left. So I decided to take a long shower (note my other roommates take 30+ minute showers daily so the effect on the water bill will be minimal and I will pay extra if needed).\n\nShe is now extremely mad at me for not letting her use the bathroom when she needed to. My other roommates are split. One said that she needs to just take the later shower or hold it until I am done, while the other thinks that I am an ass for extending my shower just because I was annoyed.\n\nAm I the AH for not letting her use the bathroom and taking a long shower?\n\nEdit: To all the people saying to tell her before I shower, I have tried that and it did not stop for from interrupting me. \n\nAlso, I am 100% fine with her using the bathroom while I am in the shower, but she has expressed that she is not comfortable with that.

Either way, you tried finding ways to accommodate her but she either refused them or didn't take advantage of them, so personally I think being a bit petty is more than valid considering the lengths you've gone to to try and avoid this issue.", "NTA.\n\nDon't let her kick you out of the bathroom, don't offer to let her use the bathroom while you're in it either, and don't be nice about it because that just reinforces her belief that she was right to make those demands in the first place. She's not.\n\nAnd stop trying to catch her out like if you just took a two minute shower and only after you heard her go to bed and after having personally extended an invitation for her to pee prior to commencing your shower then she'd be forced to admit she's being a selfish asshole. It will never happen, it just makes you look crazy. Because you're acting crazy.\n\nShe can wait. That's all there is to it.

Rude!", "Hand her a pair of ear plugs and tell her you\u2019re going for a shower and will NOT be letting her in.   \nNTA", "I\u2019m taking a shower in about 5 minutes.  Go now or you\u2019ll have to wait until I\u2019m out because I\u2019m not getting out of the shower for you. NTA.  It\u2019s ridiculous.", "And if she\u2019s asleep by 9:30, why is she bothering you at 10:30? NTA.", "NTA although I don't agree with petty decisions to punish others so you are the ass for that. This needs to be talked through and an agreement reached, there is no reason you should get out of the shower, an adult should be able to hold it most of the time, it is just not possible that this person is absolutely desperate every time, it's clearly a habit they developed to pee before sleep or something, they hear the shower and think they must go pee before sleep, like Pavlovs dog, they have trained themselves to toilet at the sound of a shower! My bf had this issue for a few months, he managed to untrain himself mercifully!", "Nta, this seems very weird.  But taking 30+ minute showers is extremely wasteful and excessive", "NTA \n\nI would be petty and start knocking when she is in the shower if you are home at that time\n\nBut yeah tell her to cut it out, she is doing some power play, maybe she wants you out so a friend can move in", "She\u2019s purposely being a jerk", "Yes", "Smart!  And convenient!", "That is what l think too, she is being a little sketchy", "\u201cI\u2019m worried about your health. People with diabetes tend to have to go pee more often\u2026\u201d", "Solution: turn on the shower but immediately leave the bathroom and keep the door open. This will prompt her to come out and do her routine. After she leaves you are good to go! xD", "NTA tell her to wear a diaper I\u2019d be pissed", "NTA i would be petty and gift her a bedside commode.", "You said you've tried telling her you're going to have a shower so that she can use the bathroom first, but this hasn't worked.\n\nHow about trying again, every single night, and if she says she doesn't need the bathroom, tell her very firmly that you won't be stopping your shower if she changes her mind in the next 30 minutes.\n\nAnd absolutely do NOT stop your shower and let her in.\n\nNTA", "NTA....lock the door, play loud music or just ignore, it will resolve itself soon enough if you refuse to play the game.", "Tell her to piss and get out or wait.  You are nta.  She doesn't get to make ALL the rules.  If she isn't comfortable peeing while you are showering then it is on her.", "NTA for the above scenario but you're all TA for taking such long showers.\n\nUltra low flow is 1.5 gpm. Assuming you have  amazing water conserving shower heads a 30 minute shower would be 45 gallons. A 40 minute shower would be 60 gallons.\n\nTaking daily showers that long is disgustingly wasteful.", "NTA. I take one, three hour shower every week, and when I lived in a 3bd, 1 bath apartment with five people, I would ask everyone beforehand if they needed to use the bathroom. If anyone needed to shower for work or sleep or whatever, they went first, because three hours is a fucking inconvenience. I also had built in stopping points to my routine, in case someone had to use the bathroom. (To clarify: I never ran the water for more than thirty minutes, we didn\u2019t pay for water, all roommates were warned of my weekly everything showers prior to signing the lease, I took a five minute shower at the gym every day - just didn\u2019t wash my hair during those, and I would deep clean the bathroom at the same time as my showers.) \n\nThat was three hours. Twenty minutes is perfectly reasonable.", "Nta, start keeping a chart to show your roommates cause this is weird behavior", "NTA. Either she's into you or she desperately needs to do some Kegel exercises.", "NTA\n\n\nIs the shower sounds triggering her into needing to use the bathroom at night and she's too embarrassed to admit it??\n\nI would just start knocking on her door before you get in the shower and tell her to go pee now or she need to wait till you're done. Make sure to turn the first so she hears it. If she's mad about her \"sleep\" being interrupted I would tell her you feel the same way about your shower time being interrupted.", "NTA but she is, feels like she is doing this deliberately to you.", "NTA. You should wait until she goes to the bathroom then get in the shower", "NTA buy her a commode.", "NTA and wtf is her problem? She is so lucky I\u2019m not roommates with her. I would have ended her bullshit awhile ago. Do not let her push you and do not stop accommodating her seriously. She\u2019s just being an ah and singling you out if you can\u2019t tell already", "Nta. she sounds like my sister, ironically also named valery.", "NTA and is it possible this is a form of sexual harassment? She very clearly doing it on purpose and I can\u2019t figure out any other reason why", "I would tell her straight up that you are never getting out of the shower for her again- she had pulled you out of the shower over 30 times (or an estimate) which is ridiculous and you are done.  If she has to pee THAT badly, she can pee with you in the shower.  If she isn't willing to do that then it isn't a true emergency.  I would also say this in front of the other roommates so that she doesn't twist your words around.", "Or badder leak pads, if she doesn\u2019t want to try the diapers.", "If it isn't a Pavlovian reflex, like someone else suggested, it really seems to be malicious. To try this out, ask her to always go pee before you shower. Even if she doesn't have to at that time, she'll be able to squeeze a few drops out so she won't have to go during your shower. If she isn't ready to comply with that rule, but still tries to disturb you, the case is clear.", "ESH.\n\nYou suck for hogging the bathroom for 40 mins every single day when there is one bathroom for 4 people.  You're not the only one who lives there and other people have bathroom needs.  She sucks for constantly interrupting you within the first few mins of your shower."]}
