To be honest, Im not a big fan of Z. He's the type that asks for free veterinary advice then resents my answer if it's not the one he wants to hear (example, he got very offended that when asked I confirmed what his vet said about his dog being obese). he also is a bit.. creepy I guess? He has said things that make me a bit uncomfortable. but my BF just says he \"doesnt realize how what he says sounds\". so I just try to avoid him whenever he comes over. when he came over I gave the usual \"dont touch the cat, just ignore her\". he agreed but in a way that made it seem like he thought I was being overbearing or controlling. I busied myself with some case reports I had to write for work in the living room\n\nZ and my BF eventually went into our bedroom because BF got a new collectable figure and wanted to show him. I told them my cat was in there and please just dont mess with her. Z rolled his eyes but agreed. a few minutes later I heard him say \"awe, are you a grumpy kitty?\" and I knew he was doing exactly what I asked him not too so I went to the bedroom\n\nI could see my cat was sitting on her favorite spot in the bed looking real pissed off leaning away from his hand, pupils dilated, ears pinned back flat, and tail lashing. as I called out to fucking stop he was reaching for her again and well.. she bit the crap out of him. grabbed and chewed. he freaked and she ran away to the closet\n\nas I left to make sure my cat was okay BF drove him to a walk in climic. he got it all cleaned and bandaged up and a tetanus shot with some antibiotics to take after\n\nBF and friend were mad I didnt offer to pay for the medical bill. IMO I tried keeping her confined away from them and repeatedly said to not touch her, and yet he still couldnt listen! she only bites if you mess with her and it was 100% preventable if he followed directions. Honestly, Im kind of angry at my BF for letting him do that at all. he said Z \"couldnt have known\" and that just because I work with animals doesnt mean everyone else does too. but I feel like you dont need to work in vetmed to follow explicit instructions or know when a cat is pissed off\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689693814, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1531f68/aita_for_not_paying_medical_expenses_after_my_cat/", "score": 149, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
