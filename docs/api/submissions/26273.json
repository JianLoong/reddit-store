We live in Spain, so the best option to travel to Hungary was with Ryanair, a low cost company. We had a closed turn flight because I had to go back to work. At the last minute my sister decided to stay a few more days. When I say last minute, it's literally being at the airport. We couldn't change the flight date anymore, so after buying a new book at the duty free I thought it would be nice for once to travel comfortably on Ryanair. I had a 4+ hour flight ahead of me with two seats next to each other (you have to pay extra to sit next to your companion or choose seats in general). Once on the plane I sat in the middle seat leaving my jacket and bag on the window seat. Soon after a girl (mid 20s) sat in the aisle seat. When the flight attendants were closing the doors the girl tells me to move to the window seat that her boyfriend is going to occupy the middle seat. I immediately tell her no. She began to tell me that I did not have the right to occupy the two spaces and that in any case she had the same right to the free seat as I did. I didn't feel like arguing, so my answer was \"if you have a problem, call the FA\" hoping that she would leave the matter as it was and she wouldn't continue insisting. Obviously she started to get the attention of the FA at the front of the plane. As soon as the FA arrived at our row, the boyfriend was already standing in the middle of the aisle waiting for the FA to \"put me in my place\". As soon as she started to tell the FA that I refused to move so that her boyfriend could sit down, I just showed her on my phone that I had bought both seats and that I had no intention of moving because both seats were mine. The FA apologized to me and told the boy to go back to his seat. Throughout the flight the girl was throwing profanitys and insults at me. When I got off the plane, a woman who was traveling a few rows behind told me that I should have let them travel together and that made me wonder how I acted. So... AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: The idea of \u200b\u200bthe extra seat was not to have my things, but to be able to stretch my legs. At Ryanair the seats are so close together that the knees touch the seat in front. So having let that couple sit together implied my discomfort for more than 4 hours. Also, it's not that I chose to be petty, I chose to use the seats that I had paid for.

Ryanair is a bus with wings, quite uncomfortable and with very little space", "It has escalated to a new level recently and it is so confusing why.
