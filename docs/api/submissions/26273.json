We live in Spain, so the best option to travel to Hungary was with Ryanair, a low cost company. We had a closed turn flight because I had to go back to work. At the last minute my sister decided to stay a few more days. When I say last minute, it's literally being at the airport. We couldn't change the flight date anymore, so after buying a new book at the duty free I thought it would be nice for once to travel comfortably on Ryanair. I had a 4+ hour flight ahead of me with two seats next to each other (you have to pay extra to sit next to your companion or choose seats in general). Once on the plane I sat in the middle seat leaving my jacket and bag on the window seat. Soon after a girl (mid 20s) sat in the aisle seat. When the flight attendants were closing the doors the girl tells me to move to the window seat that her boyfriend is going to occupy the middle seat. I immediately tell her no. She began to tell me that I did not have the right to occupy the two spaces and that in any case she had the same right to the free seat as I did. I didn't feel like arguing, so my answer was \"if you have a problem, call the FA\" hoping that she would leave the matter as it was and she wouldn't continue insisting. Obviously she started to get the attention of the FA at the front of the plane. As soon as the FA arrived at our row, the boyfriend was already standing in the middle of the aisle waiting for the FA to \"put me in my place\". As soon as she started to tell the FA that I refused to move so that her boyfriend could sit down, I just showed her on my phone that I had bought both seats and that I had no intention of moving because both seats were mine. The FA apologized to me and told the boy to go back to his seat. Throughout the flight the girl was throwing profanitys and insults at me. When I got off the plane, a woman who was traveling a few rows behind told me that I should have let them travel together and that made me wonder how I acted. So... AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: The idea of \u200b\u200bthe extra seat was not to have my things, but to be able to stretch my legs.

With this company the counters only work to leave checked bags. Everything works online. When you arrive at the boarding gate is: For example, your flight departs from gate A8 and you fly to Rome at 12:40. At 12:00 they are boarding the flight to Munich, which is delayed. If you're lucky you get directly onto the plane, otherwise they take you down to the tarmac regardless of the weather. At 12:20 the flight attendant closes the boarding to Munich and tells the passengers on the flight to Rome who have a priority ticket on which side to queue and where the rest have to queue. When the plane arrives, the passengers get off and, without the seats cooling down, boarding is opened. The time comes when the flight should leave and you are still in line, but nothing happens, because it is Ryanair. What I mean is that the time frame they would have to resell those tickets is 5-10 minutes at most. In addition, they must wait until the last call just in case. So they would have less than 5 minutes left to put the tickets on sale and sell them, wait for that person to pass the security check and get to the boarding gate.", "No digo que no tengas raz\u00f3n en cuanto a su actitud.

La chica maleducada sigue montando el pollo y llama a la azafata. Y t\u00fa sigues sonriendo. La satisfacci\u00f3n que da cuando la ponen en su sitio. Eres t\u00fa la que ganas por no rebajarte a su nivel.\nPero bueno, tampoco creo que hayas sido maleducada ni nada, solo es un consejo para mejorar un poquito. Prueba a seguirlo la pr\u00f3xima vez que tengas un conflicto, ya ver\u00e1s que bien te sientes :)", "I don't know why I'm shocked, but I absolutely am.", "Yeah, for me it's 100% always women who ask me to move, nope...", "La pr\u00f3xima vez (espero no tener que verme en otra as\u00ed \ud83d\ude02) intentar\u00e9 seguir el consejo de \u201cdientes dientes\u201d y ser s\u00faper mega amable.

Es lo que tiene vivir en sociedad.\nTambi\u00e9n he aprendido que hay veces que la gente act\u00faa de manera maleducada por muchos motivos. Es posible que est\u00e9n pasando por un mal momento en su vida. Quiz\u00e1s alg\u00fan familiar tiene una enfermedad terminal. O a lo mejor le pasa que tiene un dolor cr\u00f3nico que le hace tener poca paciencia. Mil cosas. Que no es excusa, pero como no lo sabemos es mejor darles el beneficio de la duda y tener compasi\u00f3n. Todos cometemos errores y tenemos d\u00edas tontos. Nadie le hace da\u00f1o a otros si no est\u00e1n sufriendo ellos mismos.\n\n\"Dientes dientes\" - me encanta! llevo tanto tiempo fuera que ni me acordaba de esto XD\nAy nunca pens\u00e9 que esa escena me dar\u00eda nostalgia, jajaja"]}
