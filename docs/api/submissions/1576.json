Your girlfriend isn\u2019t changing her accent for the fun of it, the accent change is happening without her realizing it. Many things can cause accents to change, mood and tiredness are a couple things. I personally grew up hearing one accent the majority of the time, yet my accent goes from American to British a lot depending on my mood, especially when I\u2019m talking about something that excites me. I\u2019ve also gone into a Scottish accent before when I was sleep deprived (was stuck in the accent for a couple days). The point is accents can and do change randomly and sometimes you don\u2019t notice it unless someone points it out or your actively listening for your accent to change.  Even if your girlfriend didn\u2019t have an accent at all that doesn\u2019t mean your child won\u2019t have an accent. Children pick up the majority of their accents from the people around them, plus family background is a factor. Your child may have a accent similar to yours, your ex and your girlfriend all combined together. But the accent may just be completely random at the same time.

Also, your comment also highlights that you don\u2019t love her child enough to hold them to the same standards to which you hold your own child.  She may be interpreting your comment as meaning you love her child significantly less than your own\u2014which is dangerous from a potential step parent (potential for abuse, favouritism, disparity in gifts etc, which can all lead to traumatic childhood experiences for her kid). \n \nAre you also residing in Britain?  Classism and discrimination are definitely issues in the UK related to accents \u2026 moreso than in some of the colonies.

Polite? Cold? Clever? Slow? Posh? Stuck-up? Dumb as a brick?).  You can tell a lot about a person\u2019s history from their accent and the way they speak, and that influences opinions, for better or worse. There\u2019s an emphasis for children in schools to speak with socially palatability in \u201cthe Queen\u2019s English\u201d, and as folks get older it\u2019s helpful to develop a variation of that accent for social situations. But, people are going to have their own homey accents and dialects that they\u2019ll slip comfortably into with friends, family, and in more casual authentic situations.

We got stationed at ft. Leavenworth KS for 6 months after only ever speaking British over a decade and the bullying was brutal.We quickly learned to hide it and speak with an American accent. Then went back to the U.K and reverted to our original accent. After my dad retired and we permanently moved to the U.S we went back to American because people like you judging. Idk how many people who've never stepped foot out of the U.S would try to tell us how words are actually pronounced or called in British. They don't call a trunk a boot for example.

When \u2018back home\u2019 his accent was much broader, with us not as broad but still northern with plenty of dialect words. Outside of the house barely an accent. His sister switched seamlessly between her original accent, a generic English accent and pronunciation and American English depending on who she was speaking too. \n\nHaving a southern mum and a northern dad has left me with vowels that argue, the ability to mimic accents and speech rhythms and a plethora of words that aren\u2019t understood outside the house! \n\nYour kids will adapt.", "YTA, if you want to prevent this get another gf", "YTA accents are very weird things. I lived in one town that had a very strong accent from age 0 to 6. We moved because my mother couldn't stand the accent I developed. She would punish and berate me.until I lost it.

When i say i got made fun of man, it is no joke... Every word that left my mouth in English was repeated constantly for days. I was unbearable for a young girl that already wasn't the most popular.\n\nSo i trained myself out of my accent when i was on public. Sort of keeping a weird hybrid accent with my family but outside  I sounded as plain as the American people on TV and the jokes stopped.\n\nNow as an adult i find myself unconsciously shifting into weird accents when i am comfortable with my husband at home.

This really is a nothing issue.\n\nThe accent switching is very possible. I used to do it myself back when I was about 10.\n\nI had two very distinct modes of speaking: one with adults and most of my family (very Queen\u2019s English with a slight hint of Bristolian), one with other children (broad North Yorkshire twang).\n\nIt was the result of moving around a few times as a child, then being settled in North Yorkshire for a handful of years. If we had stayed there then the accent switching would likely have also stayed. As we moved another couple of times the influences became too muddled and my accent has instead settled on a fairly wide \u2018English\u2019. Not posh, but not region specific either.

You sound like a snob, why are you even with her if something as simple as her accent pisses you off?", "YTA- the way everyone speaks changes depending on multiple factors.  Like, every so often I'll get a bit of a southern accent because I grew up in the country.  I don't do it on purpose.  It will just slip out.", "YTA for this and saying you girlfriend's accent isn't \"speaking properly\". You're being a snob. It's normal for a lot of people to code-switch (i.e. switch between different accents or dialogues depending on the context), especially for people whose accent is looked down upon socially, who may speak in a way that's seen as more 'respectable' when required but it often takes more effort to do so and feels less comfortable. I don't really see what there is to \"not buy\" here? It's just a very normal thing to do.

The only thing worse you could have done was jump in bed with your ex!!

When I'm angry or needing armour, I switch to the cut glass accent I was taught. It's pure classism when people want to eradicate local accents in favour of a generic bland accent, and pure classism that people pay more attention/find you more credible because you sound posh.\n\nTwo last things: your kid's accent will be more influenced by their peers than either of their parents - Welsh mum, Portsmouth dad but all their kids ended up with the same Bucks/BBC accents.
