Your girlfriend isn\u2019t changing her accent for the fun of it, the accent change is happening without her realizing it. Many things can cause accents to change, mood and tiredness are a couple things. I personally grew up hearing one accent the majority of the time, yet my accent goes from American to British a lot depending on my mood, especially when I\u2019m talking about something that excites me. I\u2019ve also gone into a Scottish accent before when I was sleep deprived (was stuck in the accent for a couple days). The point is accents can and do change randomly and sometimes you don\u2019t notice it unless someone points it out or your actively listening for your accent to change.  Even if your girlfriend didn\u2019t have an accent at all that doesn\u2019t mean your child won\u2019t have an accent. Children pick up the majority of their accents from the people around them, plus family background is a factor. Your child may have a accent similar to yours, your ex and your girlfriend all combined together. But the accent may just be completely random at the same time.

Also, your comment also highlights that you don\u2019t love her child enough to hold them to the same standards to which you hold your own child.  She may be interpreting your comment as meaning you love her child significantly less than your own\u2014which is dangerous from a potential step parent (potential for abuse, favouritism, disparity in gifts etc, which can all lead to traumatic childhood experiences for her kid). \n \nAre you also residing in Britain?  Classism and discrimination are definitely issues in the UK related to accents \u2026 moreso than in some of the colonies.

Polite? Cold? Clever? Slow? Posh? Stuck-up? Dumb as a brick?).  You can tell a lot about a person\u2019s history from their accent and the way they speak, and that influences opinions, for better or worse. There\u2019s an emphasis for children in schools to speak with socially palatability in \u201cthe Queen\u2019s English\u201d, and as folks get older it\u2019s helpful to develop a variation of that accent for social situations. But, people are going to have their own homey accents and dialects that they\u2019ll slip comfortably into with friends, family, and in more casual authentic situations.
