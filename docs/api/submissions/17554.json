During my summers for several years I went to a month long camp where first year I was camper, next year CIT then counselor. First year I met \u201cKenny\u201d and it was instant soul crushing love where he was literally all I thought about for a year.  Next year we actually dated (within the confines of being CIT so we were very busy) and third year we actually found a way to essentially live together and talked about coordinating colleges, getting engaged, kids names and all that kind of stuff. We drifted apart but would still text and to be honest I kind of always hope we\u2019d find ourselves back to each other.  \n\nI did know that my cousin and Kenny went to the same school and had the same major so I wasn\u2019t surprised when they started dating. As near as I can surmise, I knew about Kenny dating her but he did not know that she was my cousin. So I\u2019ve known about them for about a year but I didn\u2019t want to interrupt her being happy and the opportunity to tell her never came up. \n\nWhole family \u201cmet\u201d Kenny over Mother\u2019s Day. I knew he was coming so i tried very hard to stay low key. My mom is so obnoxious that when Kenny arrived she basically screamed \u201cyou look just like that little boy that Vivi had plastered all over wall!! Is your name Kenny?\u201d  He said yes and he clearly wanted to crawl into a hole, as did I. \n\nWe said our hellos and \u201cnice to see you agains\u201d but it was very awkward. Little gathering was fine and I avoided him for the most part.  At about 9 the next morning my cousin called me and she was both hung over and drunk and furious at me that I didn\u2019t tell her. I guess he spilled the beans and told her how serious we were. She feels very betrayed by me that I \u201callowed her to get so invested\u201d in a guy with whom  I had a pregnancy scare (for some reason this really stuck under he skin). I tried to explain but she is having none of it.  I tried to call Kenny to see what I can do and it appears he blocked me.\n\nI feel awful that she\u2019s hurt.

Going with YTA for keeping this from **both** your cousin, and your former \"fling\" who you talked marriage and kids with. Two very important people in your life... would've taken minutes, at any time over the course of a year.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t want to interrupt her being happy\"\n\nYou knew what this info would do this whole time... and you just waited. Why?", "I'm gonna go with NAH (as long as you and Kenny don't have any current feelings for each other). Do I think you should have told her? Yes. Can I understand why you didn't? Also yes. Apologize and give her time and space to work through her own emotions.", "Soft YTA. All you had to do was give her a gentle heads up. That\u2019s all.", "NTA.  Usually, by the time a couple is engaged they've shared info about previous relationships.  Apparently, Kenny was too vague, shall we say.\n\nYour cousin's reaction should be directed at her betrothed and not you.", "I\u2019m over here ready to be in N T A territory for a summer camp fling but this was way more than that\n\nYTA", "Going for the surprise route instead of open communication is almost never a good strategy so YTA.", "YTA.\n\nIf you have a past history with someone that a family member is dating, you tell them that.", "Info: how many times have you seen your cousin in the year since you found out they were dating?", "For me, NTA.  Kenny was in your rear view mirror.  But you might have given Kenny and your mom a heads up \\[and told your Mom to keep her big blab shut!!\\].", "Yeah the supposed closeness of you too means YTA", "Soft YTA \n\nI don\u2019t think you meant to be an AH. You just wanted to prevent issues and avoid conflict. \n\nBut part of real life is conflict. The truth is, you never know how someone will react to info being hidden from them, but majority of people would feel hurt. If someone hid something like that from me, I would feel pretty hurt based on how serious of a relationship you are making it sound to you. \n\nIf either scenario is going to cause hurt feelings, choose the open communication and honest route instead of trying to keep things hidden. At least in the end you give relationships more potential to move on quickly and healthily if you are upfront and own your actions.", "YTA. You basically set up the situation to be as awkward and public as possible. You should have told your cousin from the beginning that he was your ex, not to rain on her parade or to get him back, but so she had all the relevant facts. You blindsided her, him, and your family by not sharing.", "YTA both you and Kenny- ya'll had a multiple year long relationship and talked about being engaged? Plus a pregnancy scare? That's way more than just a \"summer camp fling\" you're trying to downplay the relationship to make yourself feel better about not telling her. I really think one of you should have told her before it became serious. Now she had to find out in front of her entire family that he used to date her cousin", "NTA. This is one of those really tough ones. I voted the way I did because whatever you did or didn't do, you could have hurt someone. As the Hippocratic oath says, \"First, do no harm.\" I think keeping out of this was really the only choice you could make.", "Not sure when would be the right time to text or call and say \"Hey I used to be madly in love with your boyfriend in the past\". Awkward af, no matter how it's brought up really. Oh well\n\nNTA tho, but maybe you should just texted her randomly. Just a \"just to let you know\" kinda thing. But who knows, maybe Kenny would've been put off by it, idk. Can't please everyone.", "NTA\n\nYou do not owe your cousin your dating history even if it includes her fianc\u00e9.  It was his responsibility to do that.  Even if he did not know you two were cousins, he must have known where you were from and one would think, he might have been able to piece this together himself. Especially if she told you who was going to be there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My mom is so obnoxious that when Kenny arrived she basically screamed \u201cyou look just like that little boy that Vivi had plastered all over wall!! Is your name Kenny?\u201d He said yes and he clearly wanted to crawl into a hole, as did I.\n\nYou should have warned mom though.  If your mom is usually this out going, then you should have fore seen this coming to some degree. \n\nWe all make mistakes and hopefully you won't do this again or need to do it again. I am sure in time your cousin will get over it.", "This was a hard decision, but I'm gonna go with ESH. You should've mentioned it to your cousin and warned your mom so she didn't say that stuff. Cousin has every right to be upset that you didn't communicate with her, but also blocking you and stuff seems over the top.  Apologize, give her time. If I was the cousin, I'd be upset with you for a bit but I'd also hear you out.", "NAH\n\nKenny likely just chalked you up to an ex to your cousin.  You're under no obligation to tell her that you two were bumping uglies.  If he knew your relation he likely would have stepped away anyway, so he's likely feeling a bit betrayed as well.  I don't think anyone here is an actual asshole.", "NTA. It is understandable that you didn't want to bring up something rather painful, and you probably also didn't want to seem like you were jealous and causing problems. \n\nI'm not sure why he blocked you, but I'm guessing you're cousin asked him to do it. While I'm sure this is difficult for her I think she should try to sit down with you and understand you're reasons were coming from pure intentions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
