Usually, by the time a couple is engaged they've shared info about previous relationships.

You just wanted to prevent issues and avoid conflict. \n\nBut part of real life is conflict. The truth is, you never know how someone will react to info being hidden from them, but majority of people would feel hurt. If someone hid something like that from me, I would feel pretty hurt based on how serious of a relationship you are making it sound to you. \n\nIf either scenario is going to cause hurt feelings, choose the open communication and honest route instead of trying to keep things hidden. At least in the end you give relationships more potential to move on quickly and healthily if you are upfront and own your actions.", "YTA. You basically set up the situation to be as awkward and public as possible. You should have told your cousin from the beginning that he was your ex, not to rain on her parade or to get him back, but so she had all the relevant facts.

That's way more than just a \"summer camp fling\" you're trying to downplay the relationship to make yourself feel better about not telling her. I really think one of you should have told her before it became serious. Now she had to find out in front of her entire family that he used to date her cousin", "NTA. This is one of those really tough ones. I voted the way I did because whatever you did or didn't do, you could have hurt someone. As the Hippocratic oath says, \"First, do no harm.\" I think keeping out of this was really the only choice you could make.", "Not sure when would be the right time to text or call and say \"Hey I used to be madly in love with your boyfriend in the past\". Awkward af, no matter how it's brought up really. Oh well\n\nNTA tho, but maybe you should just texted her randomly. Just a \"just to let you know\" kinda thing.

I am sure in time your cousin will get over it.", "This was a hard decision, but I'm gonna go with ESH. You should've mentioned it to your cousin and warned your mom so she didn't say that stuff. Cousin has every right to be upset that you didn't communicate with her, but also blocking you and stuff seems over the top.  Apologize, give her time. If I was the cousin, I'd be upset with you for a bit but I'd also hear you out.", "NAH\n\nKenny likely just chalked you up to an ex to your cousin.  You're under no obligation to tell her that you two were bumping uglies.  If he knew your relation he likely would have stepped away anyway, so he's likely feeling a bit betrayed as well.  I don't think anyone here is an actual asshole.", "NTA. It is understandable that you didn't want to bring up something rather painful, and you probably also didn't want to seem like you were jealous and causing problems. \n\nI'm not sure why he blocked you, but I'm guessing you're cousin asked him to do it.

Not because it should change anything, but because secrets hurt people, and keeping secrets usually looks bad.\n\nIt sounds like you buried it because you still have feelings for Kevin  but as soon as you realised it was THAT guy it would probably have saved drama for you to control how it came out by gently having that discussion. \n\n\nKenny also have told his GF, by engagement is in the frame, seroots previous relationships should have been discussed. I dont mean all the salacious details, but the fact he saw a girl multiple times and got serious enough with her to discuss marriage and live with her WAS pertinent knowledge to his partner.", "NTA,  You said you planned on telling are you just didn't have opportunity too.

Kenny for not talking to her about it as far as we know. And you for not letting her know as soon as you found out.

You hid this from both of them for a whole year and just weirdly looked forward to seeing him and had to have known something would happen, maybe hoped for it. On their side, you were wrong and look shady from their perspective. I wouldn\u2019t trust you at all if I were your cousin.", "YTA. You had to know this was gonna come out in the worst way possible especially if your mom is such a big mouth that she caused such a scene about it.

It's his responsibility.", "I guess I\u2019ll go with YTA. It wasn\u2019t malicious, but it was such a silly, bordering on negligent, way to approach the whole situation and despite what you\u2019re saying, I suspect it had as much to do with trying to spare yourself an awkward conversation as it had to do with not wanting to interrupt her happiness.", "YTA, because you were the only one who knew about your shared past.

You knew your history and kept it from your cousin.  You also kept the fact that she was your cousin from Kenny.  For over a year!!! These are real people\u2019s lives. Not some game.

Who sends a message like \"hey, we have aaaaall this memories together, so I came here to warn you that your girlfriend is my cousin. Cool right? I am pretty heartbroken, but yeah, welcome to the family.\"  \n\n\nBut I can see why she is upset about it too. Anyway, the damage is done. Give her time. Time will heal all of you.

Unfortunately for them, its not. Kenny and your cousin are grown consenting adults and the onus was on them to discuss their past. Is it messy because you didn't mention this, sure, but unless you and her specifically discussed Kenny anytime previous to her bringing him around then its not your fault.", "NAH except for the mom.\n\nCousin, to me, is overreacting hard but I think the main issue is how the mom handled it.

Oh, I dated him as a teen. How is he doing?\"\n\nYou sneaking and being really weird about it makes you seem shady AF and like you were scheming and/or not over this guy.\n\nETA oh look, you are very not over this guy.

At what point exactly was she supposed to tell her cousin that she had at the very least unprotected sex with the man she's madly in love with? That for years he was serious with a member of her family before even knowing her? That's going to result in an explosion no matter what and probably strain if not end all relationships involved.

Why?\n\nMaybe because she knew her cousin would completely overreact like she did?", ">still have really strong feelings for him\n\nAnd that makes her NTA.

I know its not technically incest but for alot of people (including me) stuff like that is nauseating and majorly crosses a line. Maybe OPs cousin felt the same.

However i get OP was just trying to stay out of it and probably thought she was doing what was best, unfortunately youre not always right. Im going with a soft YTA because i think OPs intentions were good, she just didnt think it through fully and i think she needs to talk to her cousin and figure out if this crossed a line in the way im thinking, because if the cousin does feel that way she probably feels really violated, and in a way that would be hard to get past.", "Bluntly, it feels a lot like that's the outcome you were hoping for deep down anyway, even if you mentally recognize you shouldn't want your cousin to be hurt that way.", "So you are hoping for that outcome.", "Gross.

Because he was chasing your shadow but wasn\u2019t man enough to admit it till probably last night.\n\nMy (theoretical) fianc\u00e9 having a pregnancy scare with my cousin would freak me out too.

To OP, Kenny is the one that got away. But considering he went out and got engaged to someone else, Kenny seems to have moved on from this relationship and thinks of OP as nothing more than a teenage summer fling. A fond memory, but nothing significant. A pregnancy scare means that you had sex. It doesn't necessarily mean that the relationship was heading places. I'm sorry to be harsh, but the fact that he allowed the relationship to \"drift apart\" suggests that he did not see the relationship as a forever thing. Maybe he was once really into OP and his feelings changed, but he wouldn't be the first guy to lead a girl on if it meant he got sex all summer. And is he really expected to tell his fianc\u00e9e all of these details about a summer fling he had at camp when he was 17? Come on.\n\nI'm going to go gentle YTA on this one. OP, in hindsight, you should have told your cousin that you were pretty sure you knew Kenny from camp, and that you'd had a teenage fling. I know it would've been awkward AF, but the fact that it was this big secret and she got blindsided by it in public (thanks, Mom!!!) has made it a hundred times worse. Sometimes you just have to do the hard thing and get it over with. I'm sorry that you're learning that the hard way!", "YTA, but I kind of get it. YTA for not giving your mom a heads up and telling her to keep her mouth shut, but maybe she's the kind of person where that would have made it worse, so that could be the reason you didn't. It doesn't sound like you've ever been close to your cousin. She didn't know who your highschool summer fling was. You might have even had a reason to believe she'd react badly, based on past experiences with her. However, you were the only person who knew what was going on. You should have at least reached out to him so he could tell her.

This is so incredibly selfish. You watched all this happen because you want their relationship to fall apart so you can go after \u201cthe one that got away\u201d. This isn\u2019t a romcom.

Were you hoping Kenny would see you again and \"realise\" he'd picked the wrong cousin? \n\nYour cousin is upset because she thought you were close, and you've betrayed her trust. You seem surprised that the 'pregnancy scare' \"for some reason this really stuck under he skin\" that reason is that you admit to discussing baby names. If you'd been pregnant.... Would you still be with Kenny. That's what your cousin's thinking. No wonder she's hurt and it's a good thing Kenny blocked you because it would be so much worse for her if you started texting and calling him to talk about her feelings.", "Um YTA here", "100% YTA and I doubt you even like your cousin!", "I\u2019m torn but ultimately YTA. You\u2019re the only one that knew that A) she is your cousin and B) he was your \u201cfling\u201d although I would call that a fling, I\u2019d call it a real relationship.

You let your cousin get ambushed at a family event. At the very least you could have warned your mother beforehand who Kenny was and to not make a big deal out of it.

You didn't tell her because you were hoping that the two of you would get back together. Now that your cousin's mad at Kenny, you might have another shot right?  And it's just a *coincidence* that you dated before and didn't realize that you guys had previously been together so it was a \"surprise\" when it came out.\n\nI can get that partners don't talk about their exes a whole lot.

You could have pulled your mom aside before Mother's day and given her a head's up to be cool. Your cousin is upset because you and Kenny were so close and \"serious\" that you almost created a life- it makes things more real. There really is never a good time for this kind of disclosure.

That was kind of an A H move on his part.  He probably blocked you afterwards because she doesn't want you having any contact with him since learning that you dated.  \n\nMoving forward, I'd ask your mother to keep her mouth SHUT about you & him and downplay it as much as you can.

That's at least a little bit humiliating for her. That being said, your cousin sucks. She shouldn't have lashed out at you like that, she should have found a better way to work out her equally understandable frustrations. What her treatment of you going forward is what matters.

That is definitely need to know", "If it\u2019s not serious enough to talk about at 18 then we need to strip all rights from people until they\u2019re \u201cold enough\u201d.", "I was thinking jealousy all while reading this.", "A teenage pregnancy scare?", "Yes. Frankly i do not want to know the names of people my husband has been with before. We moved to the town he lived in an a teen and while i know that some of his old girlfriends still live here, i do not want to know who they are, or anything about them. If i meet them I want to just meet them as whoever they are now not as \u2018the girl my husband screwed all summer when he was 18\u2019. \nIf they do mention it, oh well, he\u2019s with me now and it was the past but i don\u2019t want to be suspicious every amanda I meet might be THAT amanda.", "OP wrote in a comment that her cousin wouldn\u2019t even know the name of the camp she attended.", "So maybe this is because I'm older, but if I had to remember, provide names and details of every high school, summer camp, and college fling that I was \"truly, madly, deeply\" in love with at the time, you'd better start getting coffee and snacks ready. We're going to be here a while. I had a summer camp \"love\" too. We had grandiose plans of running off together. And then we went back home, never spoke until the next summer, made more ridiculous plans, and went home again. We dated plenty of other people in between summers. Well, I did anyway. I assume (and hope) he wasn't sitting around pining away all year. \n\nEmotions and expectation management is difficult at that age. She may have thought he was the love of her life, while he may have thought of her as the summer camp girl and never had more than a fleeting thought of her until they ran into each other again.", "I get being an adult and not caring about HS flings, but this feels like they are now 20-21 at most so HS relationships are still very recent and would carry more weight than they will when everyone involved is 25+\n\nIt's also bad because OP is still pining and did not give either a heads up. I think she wanted the drama even if she claims to have tried to be \"lowkey\" when they showed up.", "I think it would be weirder to have spoken about it at such length honestly? They were teenagers - who doesn't think they're definitely gonna marry the person they're dating at 15? All my friends had \"Mrs [Spotty teen]\" doodled all over their notebooks, some of them dated from similar ages right to 18 but even a couple of years on it wasn't considered a 'serious relationship' because they weren't even adults, of course it wasn't.  You might mention your teen relationships in passing \"oh I had a person I dated at camp\" or tell a story about being a teenager and say \"my girlfriend at the time...\" \n\nBut you aren't going to go into enough details to be identifiable. I don't know the names of the people my wife dated from 15-18? I barely know the name of the person she had her longest relationship with before me!", "How was it impactful, given she wasn't pregnant in the end? She may be 1 of many GFs he did not get pregnant.", "Oh we do talk about the past but don\u2019t give names because they don\u2019t matter.", "Bingo. A woman knowingly deceived another woman in this scenario. So obviously the man is at fault for not knowing info he had no way of knowing.", "My mom used to look at those pics on my little bulletin board and say how nice his abs were, ask me if he was a good kisser and if he pinched my nipples when he felt me up.\n\nLol as I typed that no wonder I never told anyone about my first love.", "Can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. YTA.", "Yeah, I think mom is also an AH here. She could've been tactful and not just completely blown the lid off the whole situation. Sounds like a dramatic family.", "But what\u2019s wrong with that? She has not acted on those feelings, and she didn\u2019t say anything to her cousin or him because she considered their happiness over her own feelings. That seems like a pretty boss way to act in my opinion. \n\nIf she had spoken up when Cousin & Kenny started dating, her cousin may have accused her of being jealous and trying to sabotage her new relationship.", "Having a pregnancy scare and planning to have kids together are not the same thing.", "I mean deciding what to do if your girlfriend is having a pregnancy scare doesn\u2019t make it more serious it just makes it real. It wasn\u2019t like they sat down and talked about whether or not they wanted to have a baby together, it was forced on them. I had a pregnancy scare with a girlfriend in high school and I have no more feelings of love or care as any of my other long term highs schools GFs", "pregnancy SCARE.", "not planned baby tho\n\npregnancy scares can come from whomever you had sex with, can be a long term bf or someone you just met, by itself it means nothing", "Yes, even I had a bunch with girls at that age, it\u2019s quite common.", "I completely agree. I was with an ex for about 5 years in our late 30s. I unfortunately found out his 'first love' was some girl named Sarah. I *didn't care* except it bothered me that I now knew a name. From then on, any old story he told where he mentioned he was with 'some girl' or an ex, I thought, 'I wonder if it was Sarah?' It's just stupid garbage info my brain doesn't need. \n\nI don't want to know anyone's name, how many people someone slept with, none of that.", "> while he may have thought of her as the summer camp girl and never had more than a fleeting thought of her until they ran into each other again.\n\nYep, just because OP thought they were super serious doesn't mean he though of her as more than a friend he had sex with. As for their conversations about the future? Teenage boys will say anything for sex and the continuation of sex. ***It is known.***\n\nESH, this situation is fruit loops. Got to wonder if OP's mom did this on purpose for her own drama needs? Because unless she's daft she had to know she was setting off a powderkeg with that.", ">I don\u2019t want to get back together with him\n\nI mean it is really hard to believe you when you also said:\n\n>I've got to wonder if you're secretly wishing she'll dump him and you can scoop him up where you left off?  \n>  \n>If it weren\u2019t not my cousin I would be hoping for that outcome.\n\nMaybe we don't understand your position that well, but you are straight up saying that if this wasn't your cousin, you WOULD be wanting him to get back together with you.", "That was my first comment to you. But please explain the difference, because to me they seem pretty damn similar.", "Exactly my first thought.  She knew exactly what she was doing. At no point in time was it known that the fiancee's name was Kenny?  Mom is the biggest AH here.", "Hard to be tactful when you are blindsided.  OP could have given her a heads up, since she knew for a year", "Doesn't matter what the cousin might have accused her of she should have said something to avoid the awkward situation like finding out at a family gathering in front of the entire family. The cousin and her fiance had no idea what they were walking into. She should have at least told her before the party and told her mother to not make a big deal out of it.", "No acted on her feelings yet", "I mean I had friends who had a pregnancy scare with their high school boyfriends and they absolutely wouldn't touch them with a ten foot pole now (or even a year or two later). As for the planning they did- of course you talk about growing up and old and having babies together, that's what young love is about. I don't know anything about these people but I'm not particularly close with any of my cousins, so why would I tell them about my high school romance? Depends on how close they were but it could be something she just wants to leave in the past as a good memory. It also sounds like Kenny might still have feelings for OP and the cousin has misplaced her anger and taken it out on the wrong person .", "OP calling it a \"scare\" implies that they didn't want it lol\n\nOP was just trying not to piss off her cousin, and cousin was determined to be mad anyway.", "And?", "What pregancy scare?", "fr. I know NOBODY who is still with their highschool bf/gf. They talked about marriage and kids but none of them made it past college if that.", "Terrifying!!", "Maybe that's how the 2 involved feel.\n\nBut a pregancy scare between your fiance and your cousin, no matter how long ago, reinfirces how \"close\" the 2 of you got to 3rd party. Made faaar worse when 1 or both of you kept the past secret from you on puplrpose (as OP knew who Keith was, but Keith didn't know about OPs relation to his fiance).", "No, OP had heard it was this* Kenny before he was introduced to cousins family.\n\nHe did not know that family included his ex. \n\nI get why OP didn't want to tell her cousin, but she really had to. Because this was the predictable outcome.", "and that means they didn't almost intend to have a baby together. besides that, having a baby together is a poor indication of how serious a relationship is. a one night stand can result Ina baby, doesn't mean the relationship was more than just sex", "It\u2019s listed in OPs story. Did you not read it?", "I know a few, but surprise, surprise they are all couples that never made it out of our little town of 8,000 people.", "My bad", "It wasn\u2019t him it was the situation"]}
