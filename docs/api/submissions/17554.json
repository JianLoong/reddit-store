Usually, by the time a couple is engaged they've shared info about previous relationships.

You just wanted to prevent issues and avoid conflict. \n\nBut part of real life is conflict. The truth is, you never know how someone will react to info being hidden from them, but majority of people would feel hurt. If someone hid something like that from me, I would feel pretty hurt based on how serious of a relationship you are making it sound to you. \n\nIf either scenario is going to cause hurt feelings, choose the open communication and honest route instead of trying to keep things hidden. At least in the end you give relationships more potential to move on quickly and healthily if you are upfront and own your actions.", "YTA. You basically set up the situation to be as awkward and public as possible. You should have told your cousin from the beginning that he was your ex, not to rain on her parade or to get him back, but so she had all the relevant facts.

That's way more than just a \"summer camp fling\" you're trying to downplay the relationship to make yourself feel better about not telling her. I really think one of you should have told her before it became serious. Now she had to find out in front of her entire family that he used to date her cousin", "NTA. This is one of those really tough ones. I voted the way I did because whatever you did or didn't do, you could have hurt someone. As the Hippocratic oath says, \"First, do no harm.\" I think keeping out of this was really the only choice you could make.", "Not sure when would be the right time to text or call and say \"Hey I used to be madly in love with your boyfriend in the past\". Awkward af, no matter how it's brought up really. Oh well\n\nNTA tho, but maybe you should just texted her randomly. Just a \"just to let you know\" kinda thing.

I am sure in time your cousin will get over it.", "This was a hard decision, but I'm gonna go with ESH. You should've mentioned it to your cousin and warned your mom so she didn't say that stuff. Cousin has every right to be upset that you didn't communicate with her, but also blocking you and stuff seems over the top.  Apologize, give her time. If I was the cousin, I'd be upset with you for a bit but I'd also hear you out.", "NAH\n\nKenny likely just chalked you up to an ex to your cousin.  You're under no obligation to tell her that you two were bumping uglies.  If he knew your relation he likely would have stepped away anyway, so he's likely feeling a bit betrayed as well.  I don't think anyone here is an actual asshole.", "NTA. It is understandable that you didn't want to bring up something rather painful, and you probably also didn't want to seem like you were jealous and causing problems. \n\nI'm not sure why he blocked you, but I'm guessing you're cousin asked him to do it.

Not because it should change anything, but because secrets hurt people, and keeping secrets usually looks bad.\n\nIt sounds like you buried it because you still have feelings for Kevin  but as soon as you realised it was THAT guy it would probably have saved drama for you to control how it came out by gently having that discussion. \n\n\nKenny also have told his GF, by engagement is in the frame, seroots previous relationships should have been discussed. I dont mean all the salacious details, but the fact he saw a girl multiple times and got serious enough with her to discuss marriage and live with her WAS pertinent knowledge to his partner.", "NTA,  You said you planned on telling are you just didn't have opportunity too.

You hid this from both of them for a whole year and just weirdly looked forward to seeing him and had to have known something would happen, maybe hoped for it. On their side, you were wrong and look shady from their perspective. I wouldn\u2019t trust you at all if I were your cousin.", "YTA. You had to know this was gonna come out in the worst way possible especially if your mom is such a big mouth that she caused such a scene about it.

It's his responsibility.", "I guess I\u2019ll go with YTA. It wasn\u2019t malicious, but it was such a silly, bordering on negligent, way to approach the whole situation and despite what you\u2019re saying, I suspect it had as much to do with trying to spare yourself an awkward conversation as it had to do with not wanting to interrupt her happiness.", "YTA, because you were the only one who knew about your shared past.

You knew your history and kept it from your cousin.  You also kept the fact that she was your cousin from Kenny.  For over a year!!! These are real people\u2019s lives. Not some game.

Who sends a message like \"hey, we have aaaaall this memories together, so I came here to warn you that your girlfriend is my cousin. Cool right? I am pretty heartbroken, but yeah, welcome to the family.\"  \n\n\nBut I can see why she is upset about it too. Anyway, the damage is done. Give her time. Time will heal all of you.

Unfortunately for them, its not. Kenny and your cousin are grown consenting adults and the onus was on them to discuss their past. Is it messy because you didn't mention this, sure, but unless you and her specifically discussed Kenny anytime previous to her bringing him around then its not your fault.", "NAH except for the mom.\n\nCousin, to me, is overreacting hard but I think the main issue is how the mom handled it.

At what point exactly was she supposed to tell her cousin that she had at the very least unprotected sex with the man she's madly in love with? That for years he was serious with a member of her family before even knowing her? That's going to result in an explosion no matter what and probably strain if not end all relationships involved.

Why?\n\nMaybe because she knew her cousin would completely overreact like she did?", ">still have really strong feelings for him\n\nAnd that makes her NTA.

I know its not technically incest but for alot of people (including me) stuff like that is nauseating and majorly crosses a line. Maybe OPs cousin felt the same.

However i get OP was just trying to stay out of it and probably thought she was doing what was best, unfortunately youre not always right. Im going with a soft YTA because i think OPs intentions were good, she just didnt think it through fully and i think she needs to talk to her cousin and figure out if this crossed a line in the way im thinking, because if the cousin does feel that way she probably feels really violated, and in a way that would be hard to get past.", "Bluntly, it feels a lot like that's the outcome you were hoping for deep down anyway, even if you mentally recognize you shouldn't want your cousin to be hurt that way.", "So you are hoping for that outcome.", "Gross.

Because he was chasing your shadow but wasn\u2019t man enough to admit it till probably last night.\n\nMy (theoretical) fianc\u00e9 having a pregnancy scare with my cousin would freak me out too.

To OP, Kenny is the one that got away. But considering he went out and got engaged to someone else, Kenny seems to have moved on from this relationship and thinks of OP as nothing more than a teenage summer fling. A fond memory, but nothing significant. A pregnancy scare means that you had sex. It doesn't necessarily mean that the relationship was heading places. I'm sorry to be harsh, but the fact that he allowed the relationship to \"drift apart\" suggests that he did not see the relationship as a forever thing. Maybe he was once really into OP and his feelings changed, but he wouldn't be the first guy to lead a girl on if it meant he got sex all summer. And is he really expected to tell his fianc\u00e9e all of these details about a summer fling he had at camp when he was 17? Come on.\n\nI'm going to go gentle YTA on this one. OP, in hindsight, you should have told your cousin that you were pretty sure you knew Kenny from camp, and that you'd had a teenage fling. I know it would've been awkward AF, but the fact that it was this big secret and she got blindsided by it in public (thanks, Mom!!!) has made it a hundred times worse. Sometimes you just have to do the hard thing and get it over with. I'm sorry that you're learning that the hard way!", "YTA, but I kind of get it. YTA for not giving your mom a heads up and telling her to keep her mouth shut, but maybe she's the kind of person where that would have made it worse, so that could be the reason you didn't. It doesn't sound like you've ever been close to your cousin. She didn't know who your highschool summer fling was. You might have even had a reason to believe she'd react badly, based on past experiences with her. However, you were the only person who knew what was going on. You should have at least reached out to him so he could tell her.

This is so incredibly selfish. You watched all this happen because you want their relationship to fall apart so you can go after \u201cthe one that got away\u201d. This isn\u2019t a romcom.

Were you hoping Kenny would see you again and \"realise\" he'd picked the wrong cousin? \n\nYour cousin is upset because she thought you were close, and you've betrayed her trust. You seem surprised that the 'pregnancy scare' \"for some reason this really stuck under he skin\" that reason is that you admit to discussing baby names. If you'd been pregnant.... Would you still be with Kenny. That's what your cousin's thinking. No wonder she's hurt and it's a good thing Kenny blocked you because it would be so much worse for her if you started texting and calling him to talk about her feelings.", "Um YTA here", "100% YTA and I doubt you even like your cousin!", "I\u2019m torn but ultimately YTA. You\u2019re the only one that knew that A) she is your cousin and B) he was your \u201cfling\u201d although I would call that a fling, I\u2019d call it a real relationship.

You let your cousin get ambushed at a family event. At the very least you could have warned your mother beforehand who Kenny was and to not make a big deal out of it.

You didn't tell her because you were hoping that the two of you would get back together. Now that your cousin's mad at Kenny, you might have another shot right?  And it's just a *coincidence* that you dated before and didn't realize that you guys had previously been together so it was a \"surprise\" when it came out.\n\nI can get that partners don't talk about their exes a whole lot.

You could have pulled your mom aside before Mother's day and given her a head's up to be cool. Your cousin is upset because you and Kenny were so close and \"serious\" that you almost created a life- it makes things more real. There really is never a good time for this kind of disclosure.

That was kind of an A H move on his part.  He probably blocked you afterwards because she doesn't want you having any contact with him since learning that you dated.  \n\nMoving forward, I'd ask your mother to keep her mouth SHUT about you & him and downplay it as much as you can.

That's at least a little bit humiliating for her. That being said, your cousin sucks. She shouldn't have lashed out at you like that, she should have found a better way to work out her equally understandable frustrations. What her treatment of you going forward is what matters.

That's a huge AH move.", "Doing nothing is not the same as doing nothing wring. \n\nShe knew her cousin was marrying the man she loved.\n\nShe knew the man she loved was away to meet her, and her cousins, family. \n\nShe knew his number and could have told him she was his fianc\u00e9's cousin.\n\nThis was a car crash she didn't just watch, but helped create.", "Same here. We met on our late 20s and both know that we have had past relationships but that's about it. I don't need her 'number' and she doesn't need mine because we are both adults and it doesn't matter. Been together 6 years and have a baby. Life is way to big to care about who your wife hooked up with Freshman year lol.", "In the comments it states he didn't know but OP did so all the blame on OP.", "and yet OP says it's been 4 years since they've seen each other or talked.... Kenny clearly moved on, OP *really* needs to move on, that's kinda absurd to still be obsessing over your teenage love fling **FOUR** years later !", "Yup, cousin looks angry, irrational and jealous. She looks innocent because she was \"just trying to protect their relationship\". Cousin and Kenny break up and OP can make her move.", "Your mom \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "I\u2019ll excuse your mom if she did it to make people laugh. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I can understand that but even so you could\u2019ve messaged her and said \u201cis that Kenny so and so\u201d to start the conversation. I just think it would\u2019ve saved you all this trouble and would\u2019ve been such an easy way to bring it up harmlessly.", "Honestly, I feel like your mom is TAH here, whether it was intentional or she just blurts out shit like I do,", "\u2018Salright, but good info regardless.  Sounds like you\u2019ve either moved on or at least gotten over the near-physical dependency.  Once everyone is calm and not blocked again, maybe the three of you need to sit down and talk it out?", "I think most people would consider living together to be something quite different than sneaking into a counselors room every night at summer camp. Most people made a distinction between my now-husband and I living together with 4 other people as undergrads and living with just each other as our relationship progressed. At the time it hurt my feelings, so I\u2019m empathetic to your presentation of the situation, but I do think you\u2019re misrepresenting the seriousness of the relationship outside of a summer camp context. Relationships at camp, even between counselors, can feel really intense  and serious. From the outside looking in, especially as someone who had been in a full-time relationship for 3 years, it can be easier to see how little camp relationships resemble typical relationships in everyday situations.", "LOL, I was gonna say, I have no idea what you are referring to. :D", "Yea. It's strange to me too. Like. None of this had to be that weird. \"Omg so I'm dating this new guy, he's great look how cute he is!!!\" \"Oh. Wow. Um. Hey. Remember that guy at camp I told you about? Small world. That's him.\"", "that's my one thing here. She should have at least called and talked to her about it when she found out they were serious or that her cousin was gonna introduce him to the family. It's very reasonable to have been worried that bringing it up sooner would cause an unnecessary rift both in OPs relationship with her cousin and her cousin's relationship, but this blew up in her face in a very predictable and avoidable way. The rest I think is fine, but letting this meet the family event pan out like that is a definite AH move", "Ya I agree telling Kenny has turned into my this is the best possible outcome and even then oof.", "But the cousin had no agency in the situation. OP says they grew up very close and she knew  about cousin and Kenny for a year. She knew he was coming to Mother\u2019s Day but didn\u2019t tell cousin or Kenny (who also didn\u2019t know) about the history. I get if it\u2019s awkward and it\u2019s a really eurgh conversation, but from cousins perspective maybe don\u2019t come and tell me later? It just feels like enough people knew that it was going to come out - why let it be this time, before anyone\u2019s (or at least mum) even met the guy.", "The earliest she found out was 3 months into the relationship. Emotional attachment was already developed.", "Yeah, especially since it spanned for about 2-3 years long. At that age that is huge. In fact at any age that's probably a serious relationship. But especially as a teen.", "Specifically because she \"still has really strong feelings for him\".", "These people going \"OP isn't innocent.\" What is she guilty of? Leaving her cousin to her relationship and not interfering? Like the world is smaller than people realize and just because someone fucked your cousin when they were teenagers is not that big of a deal.", "I mostly agree that being silent had good intentions. If there was no risk of anyone finding out, being silent is the best thing to do. However, if anyone could connect the dots and figure it out, then getting ahead of the story might have been better. Otherwise, what, is OP going to systematically avoid any gathering where Kenny also is? Will she hide herself from every family photo? At a certain point, the avoidance would look like a cover-up, which suggests to those looking on that there was something suspicious to cover up.", "Agreed. It\u2019s not on her either because no one wants to speak to people they\u2019re not really close to about their sex life. She kept her nose out of it instead of being malicious and doing other things to break them off.", "I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s on him. I\u2019m saying the news would be best coming from him. Lots of ways that could have happened. Op telling her cousin everything wouldn\u2018t have been great either. \n\nI\u2019m also confused why no one else put two and two together. Did he not tell her the name of the camp and the girl he had a fling with? Or did she not know her cousin went to that camp or the name of the guy op had a fling with?", "I think the exact phrasing was \u201cI\u2019ll blow anyone who isn\u2019t T****\u201d", "For sure it would have been, I can\u2019t argue with that", "Exactly. I actually think it was pretty noble of OP to hide away her feelings so that her cousin could be happy. It shows maturity on OP\u2019s part and an acceptance that she doesn\u2019t own Kenny and what they had was in the past. People here are demonizing OP for still having feelings, but no one wants to pine for someone in secret. It\u2019s not something you do for fun.", "Yeah, but even before all that, how did OP know her cousin was in the same school and major yet never mention his name to the cousin or so much as a picture? I know my closest friend\u2019s partners names and faces well enough that I would *definitely* recognize them if they showed up in my physics class.", "Mom might have thought he was someone she had a high-school crush on. No big deal, except, it was.", "to be fair, the mom had absolutely zero clue that this was about to happen! \n\ni can understand why she\u2019d have trouble biting her tongue in the heat of the moment", "at summer camp lol\n\neveryone whose been to summer camp knows its not real life", "But she said the reason she didn't mention it was because she \"still has really strong feelings for him\" now, so even though it was awhile ago it's still kind of relevant? She's not mentioning that she slept with her fiance AND is still not over him? She even said that the only reason she doesn't want him to dump his fiance for her is because she's her cousin.", "OP said their ages are 22, 22 and 23 and the last time they saw each other was when she was 18. I think the age group is close together enough that it COULD matter to some people. It\u2019s not like it was from they were 18 and they are now 28. High school really isn\u2019t that far from 22.", "I don't get it? I'm supposed to tell the wife of the guy I went to prom with that he kissed me and held my hand? I'm supposed to tell her how he'd call me every night (for two months,) before he went to bed? \n\nIts not irrelevant at this stage of our lives?\n\nOf course Kenny had GHF before his fianc\u00e9. Who is supposed to care about this not so novel construct? \ud83e\udd23 \"I thought he might be someone I knew. And then when you seemed so happy, I focused on that and ignored the rest. Grow up. I'm not in love with Kenny and he hasn't been pining over me. Stop acting like a fourth grader. Please.\"", "The first line says she grew up very close with her cousin and they\u2019ve stayed close even while living in different states. Emotionally close cousins can be as close as a sibling relationship so I do think it\u2019s very strange that the topic of Kenny would have never come up. I don\u2019t expect them to know about every hookup but the moment she found out how the hell was her reaction not \u201cHoly Shit! That\u2019s Kenny from summer camp!\u201d If she\u2019s as close with her cousin as she says she is she\u2019s the asshole. \nLike dang cuz, give me a heads up before I agree to become Eskimo sisters!", "Yep. And unless OP tells her cousin literally everything, the cousin may only know she was a counselor but not at what camp, or she may only know she was working for three summers but not where. \n\nI have cousins I'm close to, and I also have cousins I see only for big family gatherings. I can imagine the cousin not having enough info to connect the dots.", "It matters because A: Their not just cousins, they are cousins who grew up close. Aka, think of them as at least friends. I would be pissed if I found out one of my friends intentionally left out I was with their ex in hopes that we broke up so they could get back with them, let alone a close family member. And B: Kenny actually has the right to know that he's dating her cousin. He should have the ability to decide if that's what he wants so that he can leave her early if that's what he needs, I personally would if it was that intense of a relationship. He also has the right to not have that information revealed in front of a group of people on the spot. OP knew for over a year and intentionally kept it secret for her own benefit (she was hoping they'd break up and she could then get back with him). That is huge ah territory.", ">I can't even think of a single thing OP could do better here\n\nYou can't think of one thing? Not even mentioning it before they came over. No way was 'trying to lay low' ever going to work. You tell these things ahead of time in private. Not let it out at a intimate family gathering.", "Do you go around listing the names of all your exes? Even then her cousin didn't know about her camp experience so it wouldn't ever click even if he did.", "Then you are absolutely the fucking asshole for not reaching out to one of them when you knew roughly 6 months into the relationship that they were dating. You either should have texted him back and let him know that was your cousin and he should talk to her or you would, or reach out to your cousin that you were supposed to be close with and let her know you previously dated the guy in the picture. How do you go through all of this and NOT realize that YTA?", "Agreed. If this was like 10+ years ago I'd be with Op, it'd be weird to bring up suddenly and probably better left as like a funny little thing. However it's only been a bit longer then her feelings lasted and she still likes him. She didn't have to give details about her feelings or anything, but she did need to tell one of them like quickly over text about it.", "Yeah, but clearly not enough has changed. If we're taking math, here's the thing, so she had intense feelings for this guy for at least 3 years, she also admits to this day she still really likes him. So that's 7 years of liking him. That's 31% of her life she's liked him including up until now. Now if he feels at all the same then that's actually a huge deal to find out the person your currently with is related to your first real love, and that they knew and didn't say anything. Op should have mentioned this.", "Your mom kind of sounds fun even if she blurts out things at family gatherings. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "This is why I can\u2019t for certain say you\u2019re the asshole because you didn\u2019t know how far it would progress. Although I am worried about how quickly this \u201cKenny\u201d settles down and talks about marriage/gets engaged.", "No. Just no. \n\nDo not ever greet anyone that way. Ever.", "OP was in love with him. I understand they were young but I think it\u2019s really weird if someone close to you - OP said her and her cousin are close - starts dating someone you and only you know you were in love with and you don\u2019t say a word to the person dating him.", "Yeah I had a summer romance with a guy at 16 and we talked all about marriage and our future and all that. I would even go as far as to say he was my \u201cfirst love\u201d type of deal. I\u2019d still be shocked if anyone took our relationship that seriously, especially after all this time.", "My take was Kenny thought \"oh shit, this girl I haven't thought about in years that I hooked up with at summer camp when I was in high school is related to the woman I'm in love with and am going to be marrying. And it sounds like she's still infatuated with me, whereas I'm in a committed relationship with someone else. I don't want to talk to this person anymore because I don't want the drama. *Blocks OP.*\"", "It would have changed the sense of betrayal.  Not telling someone something makes it seem like the thing was more significant.  OP lost the chance to control the message and cousin/Kenny were blindsided in front of family.", "Not everyone aspires to live in a soap opera. Many people would be uncomfortable dating their cousin's ex, and ok, there were young, but it was a pretty serious relationship, not a few dates.", "I don't call the guy I dated one summer when I was 16 a former lover, it was a fling, even if my teenage brain didn't realize it at the time.", "Oh I agree with you that OP is handling this poorly\n\nI just have a hard time considering them \"former lovers\" when it was a seasonal fling that happened when they were teenagers who happened to be at the same summer camp for a few weeks/a few months max", "Yea I don't see ages but something tells me we're talking about a twenty year old. A three year long \"summer fling\" through all of high school still feels pretty significant at that age. Especially given they've maintained contact since", "Exactly. OP even wrote in another comment that her cousin wouldn\u2019t know the name of the camp she attended.", "I don't think OP made it clear what their current ages are. All I can gather is the cousin & Kenny seemed to have met in college, but that may have been the 1st year. Then OP said she's known about them dating for a year. \n\nIt's possible all these people are only around 20 yrs old, which is why they still care about crap from high school?", "You know, maybe I'm not imagining them being as close as you are, but if they're super close, I can see not wanting to keep it from a friend. But I think you're still way off on a few things. OP may have hoped they'd break up, but that's not why she didn't say anything. If she wanted to break them up, the best thing she could have done was tell them. The reason she didn't was because she didn't want her feelings to get in the way of their potential happiness. It sucks that it got revealed this way, but that wasn't her idea.", "Yeah until she gets arrested for spilling a drink on a cop\u2026for the second time.", "It\u2019s honestly sad how many people are demonizing OP for having feelings. Not acting on the feelings, not even telling anyone about the feelings, but just having them. She hasn\u2019t even texted Kenny since Kenny started dating her cousin! And she still hasn\u2019t told the cousin about the feelings even after the whole blowup. Yet she\u2019s somehow a gross, jealous homewrecker?", "I think you\u2019re underestimating a bit how difficult it can be for expressive people to just contain their thoughts when faced with a huge surprise", "How is \"another chance\" different from \"another shot\"?  I get it, you're 22 and he's your only love so far and it's intense and there's no rulebook.  But be honest with yourself, at least.  It's a sucky situation for everyone, but don't compound it with any more dishonesty.", "OP lost the chance to shape the message.  No matter how she feels inside, she could have gone for a \u201cwow, small world - gosh that was a while ago.\u201d  Secrets tend to come out.", "We have no idea how deeply Kenny did or did not feel about OP. We only know OP was hooked on him and they slept together.", "I could understand if it was someone the family was actively aware of. That makes it super weird.\n\nBut it sounds like next to know one in the family knew about Kenny. All the mom knew of him was a picture. \n\nDoesn\u2019t make much sense to cut someone off over that. Especially considering the times they were together were during the summer only.", "I still care deeply for my ex and we broke up 10 years ago. I care about him and want him to be happy but I'm not longer in love with him. And I don't think I would be happy with him.", "I find it interesting that Kenny blocked OP now... Does that mean they were still in some kind of contact all this time?\n\nReread, saw they \"would still text\". Does this include during the time he has been dating cousin?", "So what? The relationship was over, and it wasn't anybody else's business.", "A pregnancy scare can happen to anyone at any age.  As u/Palindromer101 pointed out, there was no intent to have a baby.  A couple of teenagers having an accidental scare is pretty common.  It's not like they were a pair of committed, engaged 30 year olds deciding that they're in good solid place to have a family.", "They literally only knew each other and were only together when they were in high school.", "I mean sounds like you remember your camp love pretty well and easily? Unless your memory is total shit, it\u2019s not difficult to remember people you dated for years even if it was in highschool.", "Oh OP is absolutely still pining, and absolutely courting drama\n\nBut I get why Kenny doesn't talk about it or didn't mention it to the cousin, if it was four years ago (based on comments) and he was 16 or 17 at the time, I can completely see him not still thinking of it as something serious or even really thinking about it at all now that he's 20, 21 years old. A lot changes in people's lives between 16 and 20, even if it's only 4 years.", "I had to piece it together from comments, but the three camp years were from OP age 15-18, and OP says the last time they were at camp was 4 years ago, so OP is around 22. I don't know how old Kenny or the cousin are.", "Oh. I hope she straightens that part out. It sounds like she loves you very much.", "I don't care how expressive anyone is: that greeting is just plain rude. \n\nDon't be rude. Simple as that.", "Has nobody in this thread had conflicting emotions before? I'm not saying she's N T A because she's should've let them know, but it's a soft AH. It's certainly understandable to have these types of feelings and logically wanting the best outcome for someone else but deep down thinking...\"it could've been me.\" \n\nPeople are so fucking harsh here and refuse to have empathy, which even people who sometimes act like an AH deserve.", "What I was saying is \u201cif the universe presented it, I would jump at another shot.\u201d\n\nWhat the person implied I was saying was \u201cI want another chance no matter what.\u201d\n\nSaying I\u2019ll accept an opportunity is very different than saying I want something.", "Mom the THE asshole here.  WTF?", "She called it a soul crushing love. I don't care if she was 17 or 37. It's too much for me to put aside. Fling is reserved for \"fun fond memories\". Not soul crushing lets talk about our future, keep pictures to pine over until the next year, \"love\"\n\nI would absolutely have backed off if I knew that. I would have backed off for less honestly.

All that would've accomplished is cousin would've been mad at her *then*. It was going to cause a rift either way. \n\nI feel like op was trying to prolong dealing with the rift she knew was bound to happen. She def should have told her mom not to say anything. I don't know about this situation. If kenny truly didn't know op was fiance's cousin, how did she think she was going to pull this off when he shows up and sees her? His face would have betrayed something to his fiance and/or their awkward behavior. \n\nOp should have told her cousin before this meeting. I think I've almost talked myself into a she's TA verdict.", "That may be true for you. \n\nBut if you found out that your GF had a oregnancy scare with someone in your family, wouldn't you be pissed that that family member didn't tell you when they knee about you 2 dating?", "So you'd be OK with your cousin having had pregancy scare with your fiance, and knowingly not telling you that the 2 of them had had a past sexual relationship? And having that news dropped on you at the party you introduce him to your family?", "So why didn't OP tell her cousin if it was not important? Even though she had a pregancy scare with him?", "Lol, I was thinking more that when you're cuddled up with your person in the middle of nowhere, next to a bonfire, anything seems possible. Including sneaking away for sex! Seriously though, he may have meant everything he said in the moment. But once you're out of the moment, in daylight and in civilisation again, you're forced to think through the practicalities of your future. \n\nAnd now I want to go curl up with my husband in front of the fireplace and dream of running off to a tropical paradise with no responsibilities.", "It wasn't years, for either myself or OP. It was a summer, and then another summer. So 4-6 months total, over the course of a couple of years. That's very different than actually dating someone for years. \n\nIt's funny, I remember the summers were awesome, I remember sitting by the bonfires and feeling like I was in some crazy romantic adventure movie. That all being said, if you held a gun to my head and told me to pick him out of a lineup or else, I'd be dead. Like even if you turned back time and had the 16 year old version of him. I'm sure I thought he was hot, but I can't pull up a clear image of him in my mind. I remember how I felt, but not the specifics of his details. It was seasonal fun, not an actual relationship that would have gone anywhere.", ">Has nobody in this thread had conflicting emotions before?\n\nI am not sure what's really conflicting here though.\n\nShe straight up said she still has feelings for him, and that if it was anyone but her cousin she'd have wished he'd have seen her, and dumped the other person on that spot. But then said \"I don't want to get back together with him\".\n\nShe may be saying she isn't conflicted, but saying she still has feelings for someone and that she wishes for him to potentially dump anyone else, doesn't really back that up.

If she's never met or seen this guy with the cousin, if his name is really something as common as Kenny, I think it's entirely possible she was just making conversation.

It's not that unlikely that the cousin had just not been in OP's room or simply not remembered the photo's, I mean if i meet a guy in my early 20s I'm not gonna jump back to photo's I saw on my cousins wall at like 16.", "This is the only coherent thought I've been able to have about this scenario as well.", "Exactly. If she spoke up, it could be seen as wanting to steal Kenny from her cousin. Which OP had no intention of doing despite having feelings for him. She kept those feelings firmly inside because she knew she didn\u2019t own Kenny, what they had was in the past, and her cousin deserved to be happy.", "But wasn't it the mother who brought that up?", "yeah, it\u2019s classic avoidant behavior. Why face the conflict when you can just pretend it\u2019s not there??", "I think she was afraid of saying that for good reason though. Because the first thing the cousin would ask in response is do you still like him?", "I only think it matters because cousin and mom heard the story according to OP. To her it may have been a long romance filled with love and longing and to him it could have been a girl he saw for a couple months. With very different recollections, her cousin may feel like someone is lying or something is fishy", "It's also not impossible that she was staying out of it for as long as possible so she couldn't be accused of interfering.\n\nThe amount of times I've heard about someone revealing that their family members fiance is their ex and the family member instantly accuses them of trying to tear them apart to get back with the ex.", "Honey you had a pregnancy scare. It doesn't matter if your plans were real or serious, your relationship had a level to it that goes beyond innocent summer camp fling even if it wasn't full blown commitment.", "Good lord what an insane acronym to use with anyone not at camp.", "Dude, when she posted on IG, that was your opportunity to DM her and say, \"Hey is that Kenny Lastname?\"  He was my summer camp boyfriend!  How'd you guys meet?", "YTA. \n\nYou could have just told her when you seen the pictures. It\u2019s the decent thing to do, even given her a heads up so she can decide for herself. \n\nAs she said she\u2019s now invested and could have made an informed decision before all this time and feelings were involved.", "HA this is the most reddit response ever.", "Based on op\u2019s other comments it\u2019s likely that this was a 3 month fling over the span of 3 years. I bet Kenny saw her as just a lay and nothing more, so why would he go digging. Op is cleary infatuated with kenny to the point that she mentioned if it wasn\u2019t her cousin she would of hoped they would of split. Op also admitted to realizing that she felt much more strongly then kenny did for her. Seems like a juvenile crush got out of hand. I bet kenny remembered her but I doubt he carries the same level of feels for op.", "And earlier so the cousin could have made an informed choice *before* investing time and emotion if it was going to be a dealbreaker.", "Exactly! I would never ever want to date someone a family member has dated - OP took that choice away from her by not telling her or Kenny about the connection.\n\nI would be so grossed out if I found out I slept with someone that my family member has slept with.", "I agree that OP was probably screwed no matter what, but \u201cdated at summer camp\u201d isn\u2019t a lie IMO.  Vague, sure, but it gives the cousin a chance to ask whatever questions she feels like she needs to. That\u2019s not gonna be a fun conversation for OP, probably, but it\u2019s the right thing to do.", "Blame for what? What is the harm caused?", "Is Kenny's real name Josh Chan?", "So you're telling me you're hung up on a dude you haven't seen in 4 years and are still holding a light for him. You find out he is dating your cousin and instead of telling her and moving the fuck on, you decide to let it play out and let this be awkward for everyone involved in front of the whole family?\n\nAfter this I would be shocked if he hadn't blocked you and she should really consider her relationship with you. Although I understand why you did it, you are an adult. Adults should choose the right decision, even though sometimes the right decision is a pain in the ass.\n\nYTA", "How are the two of them AHs? /gen", "All the stuff about being hung up on him is sort of true\u2026first love and all that.

However, you, instead of making the right choice (telling your cousin even though it was awkward) you decided to take the easy way out. Unfortunately the easy way out at first sometimes ends up being the hardest. For this YTA. You kind of owed them this knowledge. Also, your cousin knows how much he meant to you, maybe you didn't mean the same to him but he was a big part of your life and you chose to not say anything to her.\n\nAlso, I am not accusing you, but to you think (maybe subconsciously) that they could break up and you could still be with him? If they did break up, would you be willing to be with him?\n\nPersonally, I would send them both an apology. Say that they make a great couple and you were just awkward. Say that you know it was a summer romance and it felt intense to you because it was a first love but that you know it is the past and they have the love that continues in the future. Say that he is just a memory now and that you wish them the best and ask if there is anything you can do to help.", "I don\u2019t disagree. I supposed it was bound to come out and then be awkward. She could have gotten ahead of that but it still may have been poorly received. Depends on the parties involved, I think.", "How Kenny feels doesn't even matter. It's my cousin. If she was is a close as she claimed they were, Kenny is immediately not in the running. I don't have sexual relationships with people my friends or relatives have had sexual relationships with. It brings the drama to exactly zero. If my soulmate was among those people, too bad.", "You must have missed the part where the OP commented that if it wasn\u2019t her cousin, she would want them to break up so she could be with Kenny.\n\nThat sounds like a different situation than yours.", "You said you wouldn't date someone who spent three years emotionally invested in your cousin, I said maybe he wasn't as emotionally invested as OP thought, and your response is \"his feelings don't matter?\"\n\nHe didn't even know they were related. Cousin didn't know that Kenny and OP used to date a few months out of the year when they were teenagers. So how would the \"need to know\" information be shared when NEITHER of the people in the relationship knew the other one knew OP?", "It would be awkward, for sure. But I don't feel the obligation to tell my cousins the intimate details of any part of my sexual history, and I don't think that any of my cousins have the right to know about it.", "Because OP kinda sucks", "My kids name everything Jimothy.", "It's not your history. It's shared history with your fiance. \n\nYour fiance had sex with your cousin, and you family knew before you did. And your cousin chose to not tell you. Are you seriously, *seriously* pretending that's more than a little awkward at weddings? \n\nIf she/they concealed that till now, why trust her/them in the future? If it wasn't important, why not tell you?", "The cousin would have been pissed either way. My man spent 3 years dating my cousin? She would have been jealous and mad. It's natural honestly. My cousin didn't tell me she used to date my man? Still mad. \n\nSounds like the cousin is just jealous at the fact they used to date. Doesn't matter when it happened and that she wasn't told sooner. She literally made him block her.", "Yta. A summer fling? That you describe as soul crushing love? Where you discuss future children\u2019s names?\n\nYou definitely should\u2019ve let her know a long time ago.", "Oof, this one is a big yikes all around. I think that hiding this sort of very important info from you cousin for so long is not okay. Plus, holding onto it for so long to not \"interrupt her happiness\" while you're still in love with Kenny is like, setting yourself on fire to keep someone else warm? Soft YTA because I feel for you, it's a really unfortunate situation.", "YTA why would you not disclose that? If it had just been a guy you went on a date with once then whatever, but a month-long, talking about coordinating colleges, obsession, pregnancy scare? That\u2019s a lot, and it can shake someone\u2019s trust in you. If you didn\u2019t reveal that to her, what else are you capable of keeping from her? That would make anyone feel distrustful towards you.", "This is what really stood out to me too. It just doesn\u2019t add up. If they are very close to their cousin, AND still is occasionally in touch with Kenny, then I\u2019m surprised the cousin didn\u2019t figure it out. Kinda seems like op went out of their way to keep the info hidden.

What was the play there for OP. Did she keep quiet so that her cousin would tell her everything about this guy she was seeing? We\u2019re talking a whole year\u2026.

Sorry about that.", "Agreed. I live in a very liberal state and it still scares me. :(", "Hey OP, I want to say I think this sounds like a really difficult situation. I know it must hurt a lot in different ways.\n\nI do want to ask, have you dated since Kenny? Experienced an adult kind of love? \n\nI\u2019m just asking, because that soul crushing, world ending, buy a ticket and move away kind of love, while very special (I mean that sincerely) is a very very teenage kind of love, the kind that ends up on 16 and pregnant of 19 and 20 writing in to Reddit because they don\u2019t understand how life and a baby upended their love. \n\nI am not saying that you are not aware of this or that you don\u2019t see my reasoning. But seeing and really comprehending are two different things. \n\nYour love was super special, and you never talked about combining finances, filing taxes, actually splitting household responsibilities. You TALKED about these things while sneaking into each other\u2019s cabins. \n\nYou never dealt with work and travel commitments, how much one of you really wants to live somewhere over another place (yes these things are dealbreakers, my cousin moved to an island because she realized she wouldn\u2019t give up her dream for the man she desperately loved and he wouldn\u2019t give up his. ) Neither were wrong and it was a deep and true love. But true love doesn\u2019t mean forever and a relationship ending doesn\u2019t mean failure. \n\nYou loved each other in that reckless without limits way, that real life puts a sobering stop to. You can love someone with every ounce of your being and still not be compatible. \n\nThat\u2019s the hardest thing that very few people learn and then they wind up hiding their unhappiness and making unhappy choices. \n\nYou\u2019ve never known Kenny in an adult sense. You\u2019ve known him in a \u201cI would give up my autonomy and be a sister-wife if it meant I would keep him!\u201d Sense. \n\nReal, understanding love is me being wildly in love with my partner and feeling secure when we\u2019re apart. Both of us having thriving social lives (that meet our needs) outside of our relationship. He is my favorite person and we also go over our finances in detail and check in every month \u201cWhat do you think is successful in our relationship? What do you think we need to work on?\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s not Romeo and Juliet love, it\u2019s so much deeper than that, so much more solid. It\u2019s easy to end the world for someone, it\u2019s harder to live for them if they\u2019re no longer in your world. \n\nAgain, OP, I have no idea what kind of love you\u2019ve experienced in your life (I hope so many kinds!) but it is easy to hold to that first love of tremendous scares and no real responsibilities (yes keeping campers alive is important) but you\u2019re not paying rent together, fixing a house, dealing with career changes and moves. \n\nYour love was passion but was it strength? Solid ground? Not the air in your lungs but the steady hand in yours walking towards a future consistently and realistically  discussed? \n\nI don\u2019t know if Y T A OP. But your cousin deserved better, from both of you. Kenny loves her enough to talk about that late night and is willing to block that first wild love. \n\nBe kind to yourself there was no easy way to have that conversation with her.

To me i dont understand how you guys are super close and the topic of either party never came up, meaning you talking about your cousin to Kenny , or you talking to your cousin about Kenny. Also why go searching for info that is gonna clearly upset her? Not everyone is waiting till marriage on the whole scheme of things, especially this day and age! I would honestly be pissed with your cousin if i was you! Dating a guy that clearly your family knew about if your mom was talking about him looking like the kid on your wall. Also OP when did Kenny block you? After the interaction on Sunday? Or before? How did things end with you and Kenny, did he ever try to reach out after the split before dating your cousin? Also i see alot of people in the comments calling OP \"the psycho ex, psychotic\" etc, thats absolutely an absurd observation on someone that you dont know, but only know a tiny bit of info, the cousin clearly has some insecurities, OP doesnt have to tell her cousin about anyone she has dated in the past present or future for that matter, and honestly if i was OP's cousin once i found out they had history then i would of cut everything off, it would be too weird, awkward and uncomfortable to keep bringing the guy my cousin had relations with around her and other family.
