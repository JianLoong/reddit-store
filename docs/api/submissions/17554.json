You just wanted to prevent issues and avoid conflict. \n\nBut part of real life is conflict. The truth is, you never know how someone will react to info being hidden from them, but majority of people would feel hurt. If someone hid something like that from me, I would feel pretty hurt based on how serious of a relationship you are making it sound to you. \n\nIf either scenario is going to cause hurt feelings, choose the open communication and honest route instead of trying to keep things hidden. At least in the end you give relationships more potential to move on quickly and healthily if you are upfront and own your actions.", "YTA. You basically set up the situation to be as awkward and public as possible. You should have told your cousin from the beginning that he was your ex, not to rain on her parade or to get him back, but so she had all the relevant facts.

That's way more than just a \"summer camp fling\" you're trying to downplay the relationship to make yourself feel better about not telling her.

This is one of those really tough ones. I voted the way I did because whatever you did or didn't do, you could have hurt someone.

I am sure in time your cousin will get over it.", "This was a hard decision, but I'm gonna go with ESH. You should've mentioned it to your cousin and warned your mom so she didn't say that stuff. Cousin has every right to be upset that you didn't communicate with her, but also blocking you and stuff seems over the top.  Apologize, give her time. If I was the cousin, I'd be upset with you for a bit but I'd also hear you out.", "NAH\n\nKenny likely just chalked you up to an ex to your cousin.  You're under no obligation to tell her that you two were bumping uglies.  If he knew your relation he likely would have stepped away anyway, so he's likely feeling a bit betrayed as well.  I don't think anyone here is an actual asshole.", "NTA. It is understandable that you didn't want to bring up something rather painful, and you probably also didn't want to seem like you were jealous and causing problems. \n\nI'm not sure why he blocked you, but I'm guessing you're cousin asked him to do it.

This information works best if it is revealed in a controlled manner, but when secrets are kept it usually bursts out in hurtful ways unexpectedly.\n\nIt would have been much easier on all of you for it to come out when they were less serious. Not because it should change anything, but because secrets hurt people, and keeping secrets usually looks bad.\n\nIt sounds like you buried it because you still have feelings for Kevin  but as soon as you realised it was THAT guy it would probably have saved drama for you to control how it came out by gently having that discussion. \n\n\nKenny also have told his GF, by engagement is in the frame, seroots previous relationships should have been discussed. I dont mean all the salacious details, but the fact he saw a girl multiple times and got serious enough with her to discuss marriage and live with her WAS pertinent knowledge to his partner.", "NTA,  You said you planned on telling are you just didn't have opportunity too.

Kenny for not talking to her about it as far as we know. And you for not letting her know as soon as you found out. It's weird that for being close, she never saw the pics in your room of him like your mom did.", "YTA you knew all along, you had your feels, you avoided, you didn\u2019t try at all to keep anything negative from happening. You hid this from both of them for a whole year and just weirdly looked forward to seeing him and had to have known something would happen, maybe hoped for it. On their side, you were wrong and look shady from their perspective. I wouldn\u2019t trust you at all if I were your cousin.", "YTA. You had to know this was gonna come out in the worst way possible especially if your mom is such a big mouth that she caused such a scene about it.

It's his responsibility.", "I guess I\u2019ll go with YTA. It wasn\u2019t malicious, but it was such a silly, bordering on negligent, way to approach the whole situation and despite what you\u2019re saying, I suspect it had as much to do with trying to spare yourself an awkward conversation as it had to do with not wanting to interrupt her happiness.", "YTA, because you were the only one who knew about your shared past.

You knew your history and kept it from your cousin.  You also kept the fact that she was your cousin from Kenny.  For over a year!!! These are real people\u2019s lives. Not some game.

If you had told her a year ago, I can picture her being upset for you \"forcing her to give up\".   \n\n\nAnd, honestly, would be awkward to give Kenny a heads up. Who sends a message like \"hey, we have aaaaall this memories together, so I came here to warn you that your girlfriend is my cousin. Cool right? I am pretty heartbroken, but yeah, welcome to the family.\"  \n\n\nBut I can see why she is upset about it too. Anyway, the damage is done. Give her time. Time will heal all of you. And I hope that you find a new love. Wishing you all the best.", "I'm going with NTA. Everyone here wants the onus to be on you to tell your cousin and her fianc\u00e9 that you two were involved. Unfortunately for them, its not. Kenny and your cousin are grown consenting adults and the onus was on them to discuss their past. Is it messy because you didn't mention this, sure, but unless you and her specifically discussed Kenny anytime previous to her bringing him around then its not your fault.", "NAH except for the mom.\n\nCousin, to me, is overreacting hard but I think the main issue is how the mom handled it.

Yes, I think you should've at least warned your immediate family (mom and aunts/uncles) that her Kenny and your Kenny are one and the same and the coincidence doesn't need to be discussed. \n\nIt's very honorable to keep quiet on your cousin's behalf. That being said, sometimes a heads up is critical. I think this was one of those times. The unraveling of emotion has begun. LOL", "YTA\n\nA really easy way would have been \"Kenny (last name)?

Why?\n\nMaybe because she knew her cousin would completely overreact like she did?", ">still have really strong feelings for him\n\nAnd that makes her NTA.

I know its not technically incest but for alot of people (including me) stuff like that is nauseating and majorly crosses a line. Maybe OPs cousin felt the same. Kenny definitely shouldve told his girlfriend but from what OP said he didnt know, i feel like OP shouldve messaged kenny to give him a heads up and let him handle it in his way since its his girlfriend/fiance. However i get OP was just trying to stay out of it and probably thought she was doing what was best, unfortunately youre not always right. Im going with a soft YTA because i think OPs intentions were good, she just didnt think it through fully and i think she needs to talk to her cousin and figure out if this crossed a line in the way im thinking, because if the cousin does feel that way she probably feels really violated, and in a way that would be hard to get past.", "Bluntly, it feels a lot like that's the outcome you were hoping for deep down anyway, even if you mentally recognize you shouldn't want your cousin to be hurt that way.", "So you are hoping for that outcome.", "Gross.

Seriously you knew everyday and never thought to CALL her? Oh we're so close yada yada, but in a whole year you never talked? Because if you talked even briefly, you had the opportunity to tell her.

Because he was chasing your shadow but wasn\u2019t man enough to admit it till probably last night.\n\nMy (theoretical) fianc\u00e9 having a pregnancy scare with my cousin would freak me out too. Think about it! First, because she now knows you two were having sex. Two, she knows you two were pretty serious (talking about college). And three, she may now wonder if her fianc\u00e9 loves her for her or because she looks/acts like you and that\u2019s why her fianc\u00e9 loves her. \n\nAnd you admitted to still having such strong feelings that if it were anyone else, you would hope they would break up so you could be with Kenny again!!! Like those feelings aren\u2019t going to go away anytime soon as you still have them 1.5 years after you last talked to him. No, you would still be pining after they got married and it would be super freaking weird. Not to mention the possibility of him cheating on her with you.

I don't want to sound harsh, but maybe Kenny did not feel the same way about you that you do/did about you (in which case, your cousin has no reason to be mad?)\n\nI don't think you're the AH; your summer relationship several years ago doesn't really have any impact on your cousin's relationship now.\n\nYou said you still may have feelings for Kenny, so you feel guilty because you didn't *want* to tell her she's engaged to your \"the one who got away\"... but you haven't *done* anything to interfere with their relationship, so you don't have anything to feel guilty about or apologize for.\n\nIt may good to have a conversation with your cousin (after she gets over the initial drunken anger), but it's a little weird to me that she's so angry, and so angry with *you*, about something that has no impact on her relationship?\n\nDoes your cousin trust Kenny? Has he done other shady things that would make her worry about one of his exes being around now?", "Should she have disclosed the feelings?", "Like I\u2019ve said, any other girl but my cousin and I would be fine with that outcome.", "Cousin thinks they wre serious enough to (almost) have a baby together. This goes past a high school fling.", ">But not speaking about impactful relationships you\u2019ve had with your current partner is odd to me.\n\nWe don't know that he \\*didn't\\* speak to the cousin about it. We just know OP never told Kenny or her cousin.", "That\u2019s on you.", "Yeah that\u2019s a very different statement that what you quoted me as saying.", "Thank you, this was exactly what I was referring to.  But you can't expect honesty from an internet stranger who lied by omission to her close, beloved cousin for a year.  Clearly not a priority for OP.", "Yes which isn\u2019t even close to say \u201cI want another shot at him\u201d not even the same universe", "I think you're misreading.\n\nOP knew that Kenny was dating her cousin. Kenny had no idea that OP was his fiances cousin. Kenny and fiance were both in the dark. OP is the only person with that information and she chose to keep it a secret from both Kenny and the cousin. Even if Kenny told fiance about past fling, he did not know that past fling was related to fiance. There is nothing Kenny could've done. OP is solely in the wrong here.", "Did you not just say \u201cyea but op knew that they were together before he met the family, op should\u2019ve said something when she found out. *So if u read the post u would know that*? My original comment was about Kenny and for some reason you brought OP into the mix like I was on her side. And how should Kenny tell her right away if he didn\u2019t know they were cousins ???? We literally just discussed this in the previous comments, but I\u2019m the dumb one.", "Kenny had no idea. How should Kenny have told right away?", "who cares at this point\u2026I link her Instagram to show how cute they are together if people are invested in this\u2026which I doubt.", "Yes it\u2019s how I knew they were dating. I doubt there\u2019s pics of me on her Instagram\u2026maybe but they\u2019d be from a long time ago. \n\nI doubt she knows the name of the camp, not sure why she would. \n\nYes he did recognize me. \n\nI don\u2019t see her that often so we haven\u2019t talked about any of her relationships for over a year or so. I assume she trusts him but I don\u2019t know.", "It's not an ok thing to want to happen to anyone.  \n\nYou sound like you're still 15.", "Lol sounds like you wanted that outcome regardless. You've got a lot of growing up to do, OP. Kenny was a delightful teenage infatuation. Move on.", "A pregnancy scare and intending to have a baby are completely different. It sounds like the first one to me, but maybe OP will clarify.", "OP said pregnancy scare. Meaning they would not have wanted a baby.", "Then why do you want that outcome? If it were someone else how would it be good for you? Why should you want a breakup? Why should it matter if he's still dating that someone if you don't want him?", "You're right, but I'm definitely invested in you desperately lying to yourself about your feelings for ol' Greg though", "OP, is there any chance Kenny might be re-evaluating his feelings for you right about now?  Could that be why he blocked you?", "I'm sorry your cousin is blaming you for something that really is a non-issue.\n\nEither she has a reason to feel threatened by your past relationship with Kenny, which is something she needs to work out *with Kenny*, or she's completely overreacting.\n\nHow did she find out you had a pregnancy scare with Kenny? You said you didn't tell her about him, because you were embarrassed you'd fallen so hard for someone... so how did she find out? If Kenny told her, then there may be more going on, between Kenny and your cousin, than just \"we dated for a summer years ago.\"", "So, really, y'all aren't that close (anymore). \n\nWhy is she so mad?\n\nIf she had been pouring her heart out to you about this relationship, confiding in you about things between her and him, then I can see why she'd feel lied to that you never mentioned, in all the conversations you and she have had *about him*, that you knew him and had dated him... but if you only knew about him because she posted pics on IG, then I feel it would have been weird for you to reach out to her *just* to tell her you had slept with her now-boyfriend years ago, before she ever met him.", "I seriously doubt it. I was pretty cold to him on Sunday", "..why, what did he do?!"]}
