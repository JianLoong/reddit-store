I'm Indian, he's American. We still text cordially sometimes.\n\nThis morning, he texted to ask me for a recipe. It's a dish called Chole (or Chana Masala). \n\nNow, to give you some context, this is one of my favourite indian dishes and I've perfected my recipe. I can proudly say that it's absolutely incredible. Every single Indian person who's tasted it, even those who're from the region in India where this dish is common and popular, have said that it's probably the best version they've tasted. I even won a cooking contest at my workplace because of this dish. It's slightly different from the recipes available online in terms of cooking techniques. My ex used to LOVE this dish whenever I made it.\n\nI was about to text him the recipe since I don't gatekeep, but then I asked why he wanted it. He told me that he's been dating another Indian woman for a few weeks and wanted to make this dish to impress her.\n\nY'all, I saw red. You see, one of the issues in our relationship was the fact that he almost NEVER cooked for me. He would always clean up and do the dishes etc, but sometimes I wished that the roles were reversed. It was exhausting to constantly meal plan. Whenever I brought this up, he'd agree to cook, but would end up making things like pasta with sauces from jars, or preparing a frozen pizza with extra toppings. Minimal effort stuff. It's not that he didn't know how to cook, because prior to us dating, he used to experiment a lot in the kitchen and made good food. But when we were together, he said he didn't enjoy it and that he preferred my cooking, so most of the cooking in our relationship was done by me. He NEVER made an elaborate dish for me. Not when we first started dating. Not even at the end.\n\nI told him that he can look up recipes online, which are also pretty good. He wanted my version, and I flat out said no and reminded him of how he never cooked for me. He said that I'm being an asshole and that I'm not appreciating the fact that he loved my cooking. I told him to stop texting me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697568579, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17a5kb7/aita_for_not_appreciating_the_fact_that_my_exbf/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How do we get this delicious recipe. Hanging in every word because Chole is my mom\u2019s favorite, but my worst dish.", "Whoa! Didn't expect so many people interested in the recipe lol. I was initially hesitant to share it publicly in case the ex found it, but fuck him.\n\nHere's how I make it. It's not radically new, but there's a few techniques that are just slightly different from the popular recipes online.\n\nSoak 2-3 cups of dry chickpeas in water overnight. Do not use canned. They will not taste good.\n\nIn a pressure cooker (or an instant pot), add 2-3 tbsp of ghee, along with 1tbsp of oil. Add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, and a generous amount of asafoetida.\n\nAdd a heaping spoon of ginger-garlic paste (a paste made from 2 parts garlic to one part ginger). Also add 1-2 tsp of green chilli paste (the spicy Indian/Asian kind - do not use serrano or jalapeno. If you can't find it, skip this). Fry until fragrant.\n\nAdd one large red onion (finely chopped) and fry until golden. Add 2 heaping tbsps of tomato paste. This is one of the tricks, as most recipes use fresh tomato. Tomato paste adds a deep savouriness that's hard to match with fresh tomatoes. Fry and combine with the existing ingredients.\n\nAdd 1tbsp each of garam masala, coarsely ground coriander seeds (NOT coriander powder), and red chilli powder. Use kashmiri chilli powder if you've added the green chilli paste previously, or a spicier red chilli powder if not. If using the spicy one, adjust the quantity to suit your spice tolerance. Fry until the spices are toasted.\n\nNow add the soaked chickpeas to the pot. Add enough water so that the chickpeas are covered, and there's an extra cm or two of water. Add salt and taste the water. It should be *ever so slightly* salty, as this will then get incorporated into the chickpeas and flavour it. Combine thoroughly. Add another half cup of finely chopped onion on top, and close the vessel and pressure cook until the chickpeas are soft. This is about 15 minutes on high in an instant pot.\n\nOnce everything is cooked, remove the lid and start simmering the curry. Add a tbsp of dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) and mix. Optionally, you can add some store-bought chole masala (about 1-2 tbsp). Simmer till the curry has a nice gravy-like consistency. If it's watery, this might take a while. Taste everything and adjust salt as needed. If it's too salty, add some boiled potato (cooked without salt) that's been mashed well. This won't affect the taste. If it's too watery, mash a few chickpeas using a potato masher and let it simmer. It will thicken up!\n\nGarnish with coriander leaves, and when you serve it, add a heaping spoon of plain yogurt on top, along with a sprinkle of powdered cumin, and some finally chopped onions!\n\n\\--\n\nThe key is to cook the chickpeas IN the spices, which most recipes online don't do. They cook the chickpeas separately with whole spices and sometimes tea leaves for colour. I've tried that way but also felt like the chickpeas stood out way too much.\n\nThis way of cooking makes each bite incredible. The yogurt on top adds freshness and some tang. **Feel free to adjust the spices per your preference. I usually eyeball it so the measurements are a rough approximation**. Sometimes, I also add a bit of brown sugar (about a tbsp) to balance out the heat.\n\nEdited to add: It might take you a few tries to make the recipe perfect for you!
