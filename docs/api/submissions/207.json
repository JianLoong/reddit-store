I told my immediate family this, and offered to make them some, but they said they were okay. I also sent out a message in the group chat, with no responses, so they all knew. When it came down, I got it out, and the cousin who ruined it for everyone asked where I got the plate, and I stated how I made it at home and brought it in the instance that this event happened. She called me an entitled brat and stated how I could have easily made the dinner. I simply told her that if it wasn't for her action during Christmas, I wouldn't have had this idea to begin with. \n\nI want to make this clear. 1.) if dinner was made, I wouldn't have gotten my food out and ate what was made 2.) there were snacks available but nothing to hold over. \n\nAITA??", "created_utc": 1667177679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhw4m8/aita_for_bringing_my_own_food_to_a_family_event/", "score": 484, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Usually there isn't enough space in the refrigerator for food if the meal isn't eaten, so this really doesn't make sense at all.\n\nUnless they were claiming a lack of hunger to allow the gathering without eating.

Now with kids, I know having some snacks when the food at a restaurant is taking long or just to tide over in the car is good to have. \n\nThat family dynamic sounds really weird. The way I've experienced it and I assume most people would too is that a Christmas dinner is planned, started late afternoon and set out. Everyone comes to the table and eats way too much. Leaving the starting of dinner to one dissenting voice means a lot of food possibly wasted (or held to the next ) day. That said, I'm pretty sure I could whip up something to eat if I was pressed like par nuking potatoes and going to the oven, put out bread, butcher the turkey and roast or pan fry to speed up cooking.  Desserts are probably already made so at worst, eat dessert! So, that whole too late to make also seems strange.", "NTA. I would probably do the same in your situation.
