I\u2019m flignir, the guy who wanted to know if he was wrong about office air conditioning 10 years ago. As some of you may know, when r/askreddit wouldn\u2019t answer my question, I made this wacky little conflict resolution forum, and now nearly 11 million of you have a fascinating and drama-filled venue in which to call each other assholes and try to convince me that I should add a \u201cjustified\u201d flair.\n\nAnyway, I've spent the last few years working on something new and now that we're on the verge of making it happen, it's time to announce it to all of you here.  *As we speak, TBS and certain other production partners of mine are developing a television/streaming show that delivers all the fun, drama, and outrageous behavior of AITA in a handy, bingeable format that requires almost no reading and, at last, will live in a space that is free of downvote brigades.* I think you\u2019re all going to love it, and can't wait to share the finished show, but it\u2019s way too early for me to share any more details.\n\nFor the moment, all I can say is that if you want to be involved, and you live in Los Angeles / Southern California, have a BIG, FUN, OUTGOING personality and a great AITA story, you should APPLY NOW. The producers are hoping to be filming in LOS ANGELES by the end of October/Early November 2023. The link to apply is: [https://aita.castingcrane.com/](https://aita.castingcrane.com/) Also, If you receive an invitation from u/aliciagoodasking if you want to be part of the actual Am I the Asshole show, take it seriously. She\u2019s the casting director we\u2019re working with who is Damn Good at what she does. (Damn Good Casting is the name of her company.) She\u2019s looking for just the right mix of potential assholes to bring this crazy thing to life. If you think you\u2019ve got what it takes, then please respond to her DMs, or apply directly by visiting the casting page. [https://aita.castingcrane.com/](https://aita.castingcrane.com/)\n\nQuestions: DM her on IG: u/aliciagoodLA or u/damngoodcasting or email her directly at: aholecasting@gmail.com. Make sure to include your name, age, location, phone, recent photo and your story or again just apply directly at the link above!\n\nWhen I can say more about where or when the show is going to premier, I will. Until then, keep it classy, Assholes!\n\nEdit:  Since so many people are making wild assumptions and accusations, I've been asked to repeat the following somewhere more visible:\n\nThe whole point to the casting call that I'm linking here is that we are asking people to willingly come forward, appear on camera, and tell their own dispute story. No one's going to steal sub content for our show.\n\n*Anyone who submits a story on reddit retains the rights to their own story, and we are going to respect that.*\n\nAlso, if people with new stories that no one has ever seen here apply, that's fantastic! **We want new, interesting content.**", "created_utc": 1695991855, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vatfo/aita_for_bringing_this_sub_to_tv_lets_find_out/", "score": 0, "replies": ["Sell out.", "YTA terrible idea.

People have their drama featured without consent (this already happens all over the internet as articles reposting these stories for clicks).  You'd better make damn sure everyone gives consent.

There are very few of us and nobody cares about your show.", "It was the next logical move really. \n\nThere were something like 9 competing projects to make a movie out of r/wallstreetbets?

This sub is already a cespool of hatred we dont need more of that on tv to feul this sub further", "YTA. The sooner basic cable dies, the better.", "NTA cool:). I enjoy the sub alot so a show where there will be more interesting unique stories should be fun.  I also am glad that there is a panel format to the show. Something that the US dosent have enough of in my opinion.", "cringe", "Definitely NOT an a-hole hole, that sounds cool \ud83d\udc4d!", "YTA.  Unless its as interactive as Reddit, it won't be any good.", "Most of AITA is already fake posts so the fact that the show will be probably scripted isn't as big of a issue but I already run across too many TikTok posts of people reading AITA posts while doing something boring on screen...

There's definitely a market for your show--but I'm not in it.", "Most sound really fake so enjoy making a crappy show. NTA.

I'm glad you're profiting off Reddit and your idea for this sub. Reddit doesn't care about the users because we're just viewed as dumb content providers kept in line with imaginary karma and petty battles with mods vs power mods. I doubt the show will last, so budget what you make accordingly. \n\nI retired from my Slashdot karma after being a 4 digit Slashdot user.", "This is incredibly stupid", "NTA, will be fun.

That's emotional abuse!", "Sign me up! I'm all in!!", "They could name the show \"Red Flag\", which is a phrase I see approximately 500 times per post.", "Why not? There are plenty of shows on that cover bizarre and ludicrous things in reality - this fits right in.", "I mean people already publish these on YouTube and Tiktok and are making money off of so it could work even without the interactive aspect. It\u2019ll probably a Jerry Springer type show.", "The writer's strike ended a few days ago, so of everything wrong here it's at least not scabbing.", "An admin suspension would block everything, including editing.", "I think Marinara Flag is more this sub's style", "The entire point is to get in the comments and argue about the minutiae of etiquette and call some guy an abusive gaslighter for mildly disagreeing with someone. \n\nIt's pretty clear that a huge chunk of the sub barely skims the post before they start their amateur psychology routine. What's the draw all they can do it sit there listening to someone tell their story.", "I'm anticipating something more like the show \"World's Dumbest...\", where a bunch of comedians crack a lame joke about each story.", "Look at half of the programming on TLC, people absolutely still watch stuff like this.", "Thanks, good to know.", "Honestly I haven\u2019t watched tv in years.
