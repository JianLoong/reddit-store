I\u2019m flignir, the guy who wanted to know if he was wrong about office air conditioning 10 years ago. As some of you may know, when r/askreddit wouldn\u2019t answer my question, I made this wacky little conflict resolution forum, and now nearly 11 million of you have a fascinating and drama-filled venue in which to call each other assholes and try to convince me that I should add a \u201cjustified\u201d flair.\n\nAnyway, I've spent the last few years working on something new and now that we're on the verge of making it happen, it's time to announce it to all of you here.  *As we speak, TBS and certain other production partners of mine are developing a television/streaming show that delivers all the fun, drama, and outrageous behavior of AITA in a handy, bingeable format that requires almost no reading and, at last, will live in a space that is free of downvote brigades.* I think you\u2019re all going to love it, and can't wait to share the finished show, but it\u2019s way too early for me to share any more details.\n\nFor the moment, all I can say is that if you want to be involved, and you live in Los Angeles / Southern California, have a BIG, FUN, OUTGOING personality and a great AITA story, you should APPLY NOW. The producers are hoping to be filming in LOS ANGELES by the end of October/Early November 2023. The link to apply is: [https://aita.castingcrane.com/](https://aita.castingcrane.com/) Also, If you receive an invitation from u/aliciagoodasking if you want to be part of the actual Am I the Asshole show, take it seriously. She\u2019s the casting director we\u2019re working with who is Damn Good at what she does. (Damn Good Casting is the name of her company.) She\u2019s looking for just the right mix of potential assholes to bring this crazy thing to life. If you think you\u2019ve got what it takes, then please respond to her DMs, or apply directly by visiting the casting page. [https://aita.castingcrane.com/](https://aita.castingcrane.com/)\n\nQuestions: DM her on IG: u/aliciagoodLA or u/damngoodcasting or email her directly at: aholecasting@gmail.com. Make sure to include your name, age, location, phone, recent photo and your story or again just apply directly at the link above!\n\nWhen I can say more about where or when the show is going to premier, I will. Until then, keep it classy, Assholes!", "created_utc": 1695991855, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vatfo/aita_for_bringing_this_sub_to_tv_lets_find_out/", "score": 0, "replies": ["Sell out.", "YTA terrible idea. We'll all be wading through even more bullshit stories thanks to a show that doesn't even sound very entertaining.", "this is a shitty idea", "I like to read.", "So we're making subreddits into tv shows now? That's where we are at as a society?", "Is this not a massive conflict of interest and violation of the mod code of conduct?\n\nGenuinely will be interested to see what the reddit admins have to say about this, if you hadn't run it past them already.\n\nAlso this isn't going to do much for the sub's reputation that fake stuff is intentionally left up so that media outlets can report on it. People thought you were taking bribes for that before...so...\n\n(also no offense meant to the rest of the mod team, no idea what your thoughts/input on it were or if you were even involved/consulted.)", "YTA\n\nThis stop needs to end", "This will only increase the many fake posts that are here already.", "Will this be using posts from the sub (bad!), or are you asking people to submit their own AITA-style questions specifically for the show?", "YTA, you're making this place worse than it is.", "Lol, profiting off of other people's fake wedding drama? Hard yikes.\n\nYTA.", "I'm confused... I thought we *didn't* want fake shit to get posted on here?", "YTA. I hope admin shut this idea down. Profiting off of reddit just like reddit. I hope your idea flops.", "AITA for submitting my short-fiction drama to the AITA live-action remake...", "Holy shit. The sub is dead. Thanks everyone, been a fun ride.

People have their drama featured without consent (this already happens all over the internet as articles reposting these stories for clicks).  You'd better make damn sure everyone gives consent. Or I hope lawyers shut it all down. \n\n2. Even more fake stories.  Rewarding people with a tv feature for making great dramatic fiction.", "YTA\n\nHoly Hell", "Yikes. Yta.", "YTA\n\nYou think most of Reddit has been here for 10 years? There are very few of us and nobody cares about your show.", "It was the next logical move really. \n\nThere were something like 9 competing projects to make a movie out of r/wallstreetbets?  See \"dumb money\" currently in theatres.\n\nWe're in the a horrible moment of history but we are indeed there", "People posting fake stories and wanting their few moments of fame will go for this.", "Society needs to hit rock bottom so it can either crash and burn into a pile of smoldering ashes or come out leaner and better than before"]}
