Your friend went up to a woman whose husband is battling cancer to ask when he is going to die. And he doesn't see that he was in the wrong for assuming you're not going to beat your illness, and then discussing with your wife how much longer you have? Insensitive and oblivious question at best, intrusive and creepy at worst.", "NTA. Even if your friend was just trying to ask how bad your condition was and it came out wrong because he was drunk, that's no excuse for asking your wife instead of you, especially since you are so open about it.

I've had a brush with cancer myself so I feel fully justified in saying that if someone asked my husband that question, he would have been immediately and deeply regretting it.  This is not someone you need in your life in any way.  Best of luck to you in your treatment--cancer sucks, but you've got this!", "Op is NTA in any way, ofc.\n But I just gotta say, your \"only correct response\" sent me off in fitz of giggles. Bravo!

Thankfully.  \ud83e\udd1e", "Nta. In fact, the story reminds me of an old joke that is probably pertinent.\n\nBilly took his dad Earl to see the doctor after Earl has been really sick for a couple of months. The doctor told Earl he only had six months to live. That evening, Billy took Earl to his weekly poker game with all his gambling buddies. They all asked Earl how his doctor visit went. Earl told them \u201cI\u2019ve got bad news Boys. The doctor done said I\u2019m going to die in six months. He said I\u2019ve got the aids.\u201d \n\nAll of Earls gambling buddies were shocked! They all told him how sorry they were, and told him if he needed anything just to let them know, etc. etc., the standard stuff men tell each other when they hear such news.\n\nEarl son, Billy was just as shocked as the gambling buddies. He leaned over and whispered in his dad\u2019s ear \u201cdad what the hell are you talking about? You don\u2019t have aids! The doctor said you had lung cancer!\u201d\n\nEarl whispered back to his son, Billy \u201cI know dad gum it, but I don\u2019t want none of them bastards fucking your mama after I\u2019m dead! \u201c \n\nMy point is I wonder if your crude drunken friend has aspirations on your wife after you\u2019re gone?", "NTA\n\nNo amount of lighting him up is sufficient. I'd recommend a public burial, with plenty of witnesses and a \"fuck off to hell\" to this guy. He should have a lot of \"former friends\" and \"employers\" after this\n\nEdit: Didn't write this as I was pissed at his cuntbaggery. Really sorry for your troubles. Wishing you a speedy recovery. You're a brave, strong man", "NTA. There is a time, place, and tactful way to ask this question. It\u2019s natural friends and family will want to know as part of their grieving process.\n\nDrunken questions on someone else\u2019s wedding is 100% not that time, place, or way.", "NTA. Doesn't matter if he was drunk or not. No one should ask such a thing. I have had family members die of cancer and I never even asked them personally how much time they had left. Very very insensitive.", "So when I first read that, I took it as he\u2019s hitting on your wife.  Like, how long is hubby gonna be around before I can ask you out.    \n\nNTA.  That\u2019s just not something you ask.", "Going against the grain but NAH. Yes he was insensitive, your wife reacted absolutly reasonably and you were definetly right to call him out, but I am surprised by all the people assuming the worst about your friend. Especially the weird conclusion that he wants to fuck your wife?! Like what the hell people!\n\nLearning that a friend might die soon is a shock for everyone and it starts a form of grieving process, which makes even the best people insensitive and unsure how to word and approach things, who to ask, what to ask and so on. He stepped into it, you called him out. If there was nothing more to it, I would say cancer is the AH and everyone just tries dealing with that fucker! \n\nHope you are doing as well as possible and that your wife is in a slightly better place. \n\nBtw just because I don't think your friend is nessecarely an AH, it's absolutely fine to go, I deal with enough shit, I can't deal with yours right now as well and cut down on contact. You are the one with cancer, your wife is the fighting the fight daily with you, it's only up to the two of you what is right right now. If there is a time to be selfish, it's now!", "In vino, veritas", "NTA, but I'm gonna talk briefly about living with a different scary disease. People don't really know what to say and how to say it and have questions. And they're more likely to come out when they're drunk. I've definitely been asked that and other questions by people who were drunk that knew I was sick, and typically it's a genuine question that they'd been wondering a while and needed the liquid courage to ask.\nNow, there's a whole other argument about whether that's any of their business, if it was appropriate to bring up, etc... But questions like that aren't usually intended to be asshole-y even though they are annoying and intrusive as hell. And I find focusing on that intent helps me to deal with them.", "Nta", "NTA. Asking a cancer patient The Question is like asking someone if they are pregnant. There's no way to know for sure what their prognosis is, so you don't ask The Question ever. Completely unacceptable in all social situations and the audacity of someone thinking they have a right to *any* private information, let alone asking *when*, not *if*, is disgusting (not that if is any better).\n\nI wish you all the best in your fight.

This guy is not a friend.\n\nIf he acted like that towards my wife, he'd better offer an earnest and convincing apology to her (and you), otherwise I'd cease that friendship immediately.", "Exactly, they can't give a answer, a relative got 6 months to a year and died two months later.\n\nOP, you're NTA", "it doesn't matter why, the friend is the AH regardless\n\nthe wife is more effected by this than the friend\n\ncomfort in, dump out\n\nand then when called out on this behaviour and having clearly upset people you ostensibly cared about, he doubled down\n\ngenerally if you care about someone and acted thoughtless and hurt them? you fucking apologise and don't say that how long someone has to live isn't a big deal", "I love these, the why doesn't matter responses on AITA. The context always matters. How good a friend is he? How long do they know each other? How does he behave normally? Is he just unable to communicate his feelings or is he normally just a dick? And so on and on.\n\nThe situation is way too complicated and emotionally loaded to just say, well he's an AH. We don't know how we handle each individual grief until we are in it. Grieving people suck most of the time, they are selfish and aggressive, attack the wrong people, pull back, isolate themselves, drink to much, the list goes on. Grieving wrecks people. Yes OP is alive and will hopefully be for a long and happy life, but the fear in itself can make people lose their mind.\n\nThe friend shouldn't have done it, as I said, I just consider that maybe he is falling apart as well and don't know how to handle it. Doesn't make it right for OP and his wife and as I stated it would be understandable if the pulled back from this. It's just, the world isn't black and white, not handling something great doesn't make you an AH. This sub would get better if the commenters remembered this more often. \n\nSometimes this sub is a bandwagon of hate and negativity over human mistakes or not being perfect. But not being perfect isn't automatically AH territory. And sometimes it is, but it's understandable in context. Also people often forget plausability in their comments. What makes more sense statistically and in human nature: friend asks because he wants to know when he can fuck the wife or a terrified friend struggling with the thought of losing a friend and their own mortality trying to get some imaginary control over this situation back?!", "> The context always matters. How good a friend is he? How long do they know each other? How does he behave normally? Is he just unable to communicate his feelings or is he normally just a dick? And so on and on.\n\n\nthe context ALMOST always matters in terms of what you do next and how seriously you respond. but it very frequently doesn't matter in determining someone an AH\n\nnot every AH move needs to terminate a friendship etc\n\nbut the why doesn't really matter here. it doesn't matter if this is normative behaviour ot very unusual. it doesn't matter if he's a dick or bad at communicating\n\nbecause he was still an AH\n\n> But not being perfect isn't automatically AH territory.\n\nyou seem to have missed the part where I not only said that this was a massive screw up, but the much bigger issue is that when he was confronted, he doubled down\n\npeople make mistakes. people do thoughtless things\n\nyou when get an opportunity to apologise and take accountability and try to help heal the person you've harmed\n\nor you can do what the person the story did which is none of those things, plus doubling down, plus saying that his friends possible soon death \"isn't a big deal\"\n\nyou're going out of your way up come up with justifications for this, but the thing is, no matter the scenario, this was AH behaviour\n\nand the reason isn't because I demand perfection. but because when you screw up, it's an AH move to not apologise, it's an AH move to duck accountability, it's an AH move to double down, it's an AH move to be dismissive and insensitive, and it's an AH move to tell someone with cancer that how long they have to live isn't a big deal\n\nso please tell, exactly what kind of backstory would justify that behaviour?"]}
