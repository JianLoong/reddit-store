The doctors really don't know the answer anyways. I have a friend that was hit with Stage 4 lung cancer given 6 months to live. That was 4-5 years ago and he's been given a clean bill of health recently.\n\nGood luck with the fight and here's to a full and speedy recovery.", "NTA, especially given your wife's reaction to his idiotic question. Hope you gave him hell.", "NTA, your friend is an AH though.   Friend may be too strong of a word though.", "NTA.  That was outrageous!  What right does he have to ask your wife a question like that.  He\u2019s a huge AH!", "NTA. Even drunk, that is more than just insensitive, it is incredibly rude! I cannot think of a situation outside of a medical office that this is appropriate to even ask.\n\nGood on you for sticking up for yourself and your wife.", "NTA your friend on the other hand is", "sounds like he wanting to know how long he will have to wait before trying to get into your wife's dms", "NTA. And I\u2019m sorry that you are going through this.", "NTA\n\nThat was just plain insensitive of him. Nothing else to say about it.", "NTA, but I am not sure why you feel the need to ask. \n\nI hope treatment goes well, though! And that dude needs a couple new ones ripped.", "NTA\n\nYou go and kick that cancer\u2019 ass!", "NTA. I had lymphoma last year. I would have lost my shit at someone who asked my husband when I was going to die. (Chemo sucked, but I\u2019m in full remission. I wish you the same success.)", "\nNNNNNNNNNTTTTTTAAAA\nYou know one of the side effects of cancer is that people say the most appalling things. I'm a two-time survivor.  People don't seem to know how to behave. A simple, how you doing buddy is all that's necessary. \nI send you peace and strength. I don't  need to send you courage because it's obvious you already have that.", "Going to be devil's advocate here. Maybe he wanted to know how bad it is/how long he'll be able to still hang out with you (assuming he does). He was also a bit drunk as you mentioned, so he wouldn't necessarily be thinking straight and it came out sounding insensitive.\n\nGoing to need more info on this one.", "nta, i bet he is interested in your wife.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your friend went up to a woman whose husband is battling cancer to ask when he is going to die. And he doesn't see that he was in the wrong for assuming you're not going to beat your illness, and then discussing with your wife how much longer you have? Insensitive and oblivious question at best, intrusive and creepy at worst.", "NTA. Even if your friend was just trying to ask how bad your condition was and it came out wrong because he was drunk, that's no excuse for asking your wife instead of you, especially since you are so open about it.

I've had a brush with cancer myself so I feel fully justified in saying that if someone asked my husband that question, he would have been immediately and deeply regretting it.  This is not someone you need in your life in any way.  Best of luck to you in your treatment--cancer sucks, but you've got this!", "Op is NTA in any way, ofc.\n But I just gotta say, your \"only correct response\" sent me off in fitz of giggles. Bravo!
