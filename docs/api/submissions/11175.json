That was 4-5 years ago and he's been given a clean bill of health recently.\n\nGood luck with the fight and here's to a full and speedy recovery.", "NTA, especially given your wife's reaction to his idiotic question.

What right does he have to ask your wife a question like that.  He\u2019s a huge AH!", "NTA. Even drunk, that is more than just insensitive, it is incredibly rude!

Maybe he wanted to know how bad it is/how long he'll be able to still hang out with you (assuming he does).

Your friend went up to a woman whose husband is battling cancer to ask when he is going to die. And he doesn't see that he was in the wrong for assuming you're not going to beat your illness, and then discussing with your wife how much longer you have? Insensitive and oblivious question at best, intrusive and creepy at worst.", "NTA. Even if your friend was just trying to ask how bad your condition was and it came out wrong because he was drunk, that's no excuse for asking your wife instead of you, especially since you are so open about it. He should have talked to you - and not while drunk.", "NTA- he seems completely unempathetic and someone you shouldn\u2019t have around your family while kicking cancers ass.", "NTA - OP, even if he had been falling down, puking drunk, that question to your wife was inexcusable!  I've had a brush with cancer myself so I feel fully justified in saying that if someone asked my husband that question, he would have been immediately and deeply regretting it.  This is not someone you need in your life in any way.  Best of luck to you in your treatment--cancer sucks, but you've got this!", "Op is NTA in any way, ofc.\n But I just gotta say, your \"only correct response\" sent me off in fitz of giggles. Bravo!

In fact, the story reminds me of an old joke that is probably pertinent.\n\nBilly took his dad Earl to see the doctor after Earl has been really sick for a couple of months. The doctor told Earl he only had six months to live. That evening, Billy took Earl to his weekly poker game with all his gambling buddies. They all asked Earl how his doctor visit went. Earl told them \u201cI\u2019ve got bad news Boys. The doctor done said I\u2019m going to die in six months. He said I\u2019ve got the aids.\u201d \n\nAll of Earls gambling buddies were shocked! They all told him how sorry they were, and told him if he needed anything just to let them know, etc. etc., the standard stuff men tell each other when they hear such news.\n\nEarl son, Billy was just as shocked as the gambling buddies. He leaned over and whispered in his dad\u2019s ear \u201cdad what the hell are you talking about? You don\u2019t have aids! The doctor said you had lung cancer!\u201d\n\nEarl whispered back to his son, Billy \u201cI know dad gum it, but I don\u2019t want none of them bastards fucking your mama after I\u2019m dead! \u201c \n\nMy point is I wonder if your crude drunken friend has aspirations on your wife after you\u2019re gone?", "NTA\n\nNo amount of lighting him up is sufficient. I'd recommend a public burial, with plenty of witnesses and a \"fuck off to hell\" to this guy. He should have a lot of \"former friends\" and \"employers\" after this\n\nEdit: Didn't write this as I was pissed at his cuntbaggery. Really sorry for your troubles. Wishing you a speedy recovery. You're a brave, strong man", "NTA. There is a time, place, and tactful way to ask this question. It\u2019s natural friends and family will want to know as part of their grieving process.\n\nDrunken questions on someone else\u2019s wedding is 100% not that time, place, or way.", "NTA. Doesn't matter if he was drunk or not. No one should ask such a thing. I have had family members die of cancer and I never even asked them personally how much time they had left. Very very insensitive.", "So when I first read that, I took it as he\u2019s hitting on your wife.  Like, how long is hubby gonna be around before I can ask you out.    \n\nNTA.  That\u2019s just not something you ask.", "Going against the grain but NAH. Yes he was insensitive, your wife reacted absolutly reasonably and you were definetly right to call him out, but I am surprised by all the people assuming the worst about your friend. Especially the weird conclusion that he wants to fuck your wife?! Like what the hell people!\n\nLearning that a friend might die soon is a shock for everyone and it starts a form of grieving process, which makes even the best people insensitive and unsure how to word and approach things, who to ask, what to ask and so on. He stepped into it, you called him out. If there was nothing more to it, I would say cancer is the AH and everyone just tries dealing with that fucker! \n\nHope you are doing as well as possible and that your wife is in a slightly better place. \n\nBtw just because I don't think your friend is nessecarely an AH, it's absolutely fine to go, I deal with enough shit, I can't deal with yours right now as well and cut down on contact. You are the one with cancer, your wife is the fighting the fight daily with you, it's only up to the two of you what is right right now. If there is a time to be selfish, it's now!", "In vino, veritas", "NTA, but I'm gonna talk briefly about living with a different scary disease. People don't really know what to say and how to say it and have questions. And they're more likely to come out when they're drunk. I've definitely been asked that and other questions by people who were drunk that knew I was sick, and typically it's a genuine question that they'd been wondering a while and needed the liquid courage to ask.\nNow, there's a whole other argument about whether that's any of their business, if it was appropriate to bring up, etc... But questions like that aren't usually intended to be asshole-y even though they are annoying and intrusive as hell. And I find focusing on that intent helps me to deal with them.", "Nta", "NTA. Asking a cancer patient The Question is like asking someone if they are pregnant. There's no way to know for sure what their prognosis is, so you don't ask The Question ever. Completely unacceptable in all social situations and the audacity of someone thinking they have a right to *any* private information, let alone asking *when*, not *if*, is disgusting (not that if is any better).\n\nI wish you all the best in your fight. I wish you snacks you can eat, parking spots near doors, and send love to you and all your loved ones.", "So how long? \n\nlol sorry someone had to"]}
