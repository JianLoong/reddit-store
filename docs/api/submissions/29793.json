She eventually decided to divorce me due to the advice from her trusty \u201cfriend/sister\u201d who was also cheating on her husband when our divorce happened. \n\nFast forward, immediately after we finalized the divorce, she and the guy (Colombian) she was cheating with moved in together. Our daughter was 2yo at the time. She\u2019s extremely attached to me and I treasure every second I have with her\u2014more so because of the infertility issues her mother and I had to go through to have her. We both understood that our daughter was attached to me, so she refused to do any \u201cFaceTime\u201d because it would make it hard for our daughter to transition. I accepted this even though it was extremely difficult\u2014my only focus is my daughter\u2019s happiness.\n\nMy ex and the guy eventually have their own child together on top of his other kids from the other mother. He is originally from Colombia and they plan to take a trip there in December.\n\nMy ex knew I would never agreed to my little girl (now 5yo) to going, so she said I could FaceTime our daughter everyday during the trip. I was hesitant and leaned towards \u201cNo,\u201d but at the end of the day I just want my ex to be happy so I researched the country and even spoke to people from that region and they advised me to take extra precautions. \n\nI agreed to let her take our little girl to Colombia under the circumstances: she provide me a copy of the guy\u2019s driver\u2019s license in case of the worst situation\u2014considering it\u2019s Colombia (known for narcotics distribution, kidnapping, and civil unrest among other things).

I\u2019m concerned for my little girl\u2019s safety. She says all the information I need about her Colombian boyfriend will be left with her mother.

If you're ex is making taking a little precaution difficult, why risk the safety of YOUR child. Seems like a no brainer. Do NOT let your child go then. -_-", "Just don\u2019t sign it and don\u2019t agree for your child to leave the country. It\u2019s all risk and no reward. Your 5 year old isn\u2019t going to regret not going on this trip.", "DO NOT LET HER GO PERIOD. They could decide to stay and good luck getting her back.", "You do realize Photoshop exists right? She could fake a copy, and/or her new boy toy could fake a copy. Why risk your child's safety? You still don't know what's waiting there for your ex or child YAT for even humouring letting your child go on something this suspect, even with the one circumstance. YWBNTA if you put protecting your child first over humouring your ex", "Do you not have a custody agreement in place? The only way she could legally take your daughter out of the country without your written permission is if she has full custody and you lost all of your rights. \n\nI think you're being a bit naive though. I absolutely would refuse to let her take your daughter even if they provide everything you're asking for. It's just too risky and it would be extremely difficult, if not nearly impossible, for you to get your daughter back if they decide to stay in Columbia, which honestly seems like what their plan might be.", "And you will know what\u2019s in the envelope how?  You are being way too trusting. My guess is they do not plan on coming back and want to make it harder for you to find them.", "You need a lawyer ASAP.\n\nBecause people CAN and (in this case) WILL fake that letter.   \n\nYour ex isn't willing to give you the basic information about her bf because she is not planning to return and she doesn't want you to know where she is.\n\nYour daughter doesn't even go to the airport.", "Yeah, it might be extreme assumption, but she seems to not be planning on coming back.", "Of course. It's scary not knowing where your kid is, your family, your loved ones. Yes!! A good lawyer will be able to drag this out and correct the problem. I hate that it came to needing a lawyer but sometimes you've gotta protect yourself and your family.", "But didn\u2019t you say you really wanted tiger ex to be happy? /s", "You still have to sign the papers in order for her to go, yeah?  If you haven't signed them then don't and try to communicate with your ex as to why and don't let her try to manipulate you.  Just stick to the facts.\n\nIf you have, then you have a harder task at hand(obviously)  If you have, chances are there really isn't much you can do.  You signed them.  If this is the case then I go back to my original statement of \"she gives you the info\"  because.....checks notes.....your her fucking parent.  Full Stop.  She can not(legally) deny you that info.", "https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/prevention/passport-issuance-alert-program.html#:~:text=The%20Children's%20Passport%20Issuance%20Alert,submitted%20for%20an%20enrolled%20child.\n\nThis link is used to prevent international child abduction. Please sign your child up for this.", "I'm sorry, but I really think your ex is planning on kidnapping your daughter. I think there is a real chance that if she goes, you won't see her again. And it won't be because strangers kidnapped her for ransom.", "I appreciate the advice! Absolutely no and I\u2019m already working on preventing her taking our daughter on the trip.", "I agree \ud83d\udcaf", "Don\u2019t let your ex get a passport for her, both parents have to agree for the child together one.", "Absolutely agree! I\u2019m set on NOT LETTING her take our daughter on the trip, so I\u2019m already in the process of obtaining a lawyer.", "I\u2019ve reviewed the divorce decree and it doesn\u2019t state anything about international travel etc. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s covered that\u2019s why I\u2019m getting consultation from the lawyer that assisted with the divorce. I agree that I\u2019m a little naive, but glad it is happening now that I still have time to get everything figured out to prevent her from taking my girl on this trip.", "I instructed them to make a copy and let me confirm it before placing it the envelope for safekeeping until they return. But they said that was too invasive into their personal information. Too many red flags so I\u2019m putting my foot down and finding a lawyer to prevent her from taking our girl on the trip.", "Legally speaking he isn\u2019t actually entitled to that information. That\u2019s what happens when you split up, you stop having as much control over your kids life. It is also highly unlikely she is trying to kidnap her daughter. She wants to take a trip to her partners home country, chill out.", "Yes, I wish her nothing but happiness. We\u2019ve gone through a lot together and been together since childhood until 2020\u2013that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been cordial and don\u2019t make a big deal over a lot of the things she put me through. However, our daughter\u2019s safety supersedes all\u2014whether that brings her temporary unhappiness during the trip.", "I haven\u2019t signed anything. The only thing I\u2019ve signed is the paperwork to obtain a passport. She\u2019s been trying to set up times to go sign and have it notarized but I told her not without the information I requested. That\u2019s why now she is saying that the information I want will be with her mom while they\u2019re on the trip\u2014which I don\u2019t want to have to communicate with her mom if it\u2019s concerning my daughter.", "As far as my ex kidnapping our daughter, I really don\u2019t think she would because she has family here that she wouldn\u2019t just uproot her life. I\u2019m concerned about them going there and getting kidnapped because of the high crime rate. For her to refuse the information I\u2019m requesting is just too suspicious so I\u2019m working on getting a lawyer to block this from happening.", "https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/prevention/passport-issuance-alert-program.html#:~:text=The%20Children's%20Passport%20Issuance%20Alert,submitted%20for%20an%20enrolled%20child.\n\nSign your child up for this program so they can't take her without you being notified.", "I would consult a lawyer maybe. Make sure you do everything to prevent the trip. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they tried to stay there. Maybe even see if you can get her passport or have it kept by a neutral third party. NTA", "Fr. She cheated on you multiple times and is already making this process difficult, I wouldnt trust her not to do smth stupid", "Good on you!", "Extremely wise. Your ex is a proven serial liar and a cheat. She is being evasive and difficult. I think people are right here and if you let your daughter go, that will be the last you see if her. Lawyer up, report to the authorities and get everyone involved. NTA", "Divorce decree and custody settlement aren't the same thing. That's why I asked if you had a legal custody agreement, which it sounds like you don't.", "I would absolutely not consent to the passport; if you're in the US both parents have to be present for a minor to obtain one, even if they're divorced. There is too much smoke here to not be a fire somewhere. No passport means your daughter can't go, full stop.", "I really hope you're right, but I don't think anyone whose ex-partner kidnapped their shared kid thought \"you know, this IS the kind of person who would kidnap our kid.\"", "This is good to know. Don\u2019t know if this answers your question but we have joint custody.", "I 100% agree.  Too much smoke.  Why is she hard up on not giving you the info but is willingly ready to just hand it over to her mother?  That's a red flag.  It's about your daughter and not about having her BF's family info in another country.", "Unfortunately I\u2019ve already signed the Passport because she agreed to the release of all information I want pertaining to the trip. She also agreed that even with the passport she wouldn\u2019t take our little girl without my consent.\n\nSo here we are, after the passport arrived and I\u2019m asking for the DL of the Colombian guy she will be traveling with\u2014she\u2019s refusing. So I\u2019m working on obtaining a lawyer to block her from taking our little girl.\n\nBottom line is\u2026 I\u2019m an idiot to think she would continue to be cordial and put our 5yo daughter\u2019s safety above a copy of the guy\u2019s DL. Very suspicious. Lesson learned and I\u2019m quickly working on finding a lawyer.\n\nEven with a passport, some countries still need a signed and notarized form with both parent\u2019s signature. From what I gathered so far (not 100% confirmed) but Colombia needs the form with the passport to be admitted into the country.", "You\u2019re absolutely right! I\u2019m working on getting a lawyer to block her from taking our daughter on the trip.", "Is it a court-mandated agreement?  I ask because some states don't require you to go to court and get a legal custody agreement if both parents just agree to split custody and no child support is needed. If it is a court-mandated agreement, there would almost certainly be stipulations about out of state and international travel, right of first refusal if the other parent can't watch the kid during their scheduled time, etc. If it isn't a mandated agreement, you definitely need to go back to court and get one set up as soon as possible.", "You can always flag the kid passport. I do not know exactly how to do it but it is possible. \nDO NOT LET YOUR KID LEAVE US!!  You may never see her again.", "OP, I don't know your ex or her partner. I see you're taking steps to prevent this, and that's the only thing that makes sense. You are NTA for that, but jeez, man. You are letting your ex take you for a ride while trying to what? Not upset her? As far as I can tell, you're a decent guy; but you are your daughter's father. You and she both deserve a relationship. \n\n\nIMO, the new boyfriend probably doesn't have a driver's license, or he has a criminal history you could look up if you were to get ahold of his legal name. That's purely speculation, though.", "I appreciate your input. So court mandated agreement is in place such as anywhere my little girl goes (among other things pertaining to our daughter), I have the right to know and she can\u2019t refuse or deny me of the information. We\u2019re in Minnesota. As for right of refusal, I didn\u2019t see anything when I recently read the divorce paper. It covers parenting time etc, but it leaves it to us to figure out what works best (since we\u2019ve been cordial). This is very out of character for her, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m obtaining a lawyer to stop her from taking our girl on this trip.", "I\u2019ll look into getting her passport flag. Thanks so much for the advice!", "That\u2019s the thing, asking the full name was already a battle. I don\u2019t like drama, so trying to be cordial as much as possible has always been my focus. That\u2019s why during the divorce we didn\u2019t even go to court to speak to a judge. The whole process was through our lawyers and they even said we were the easiest clients they\u2019ve ever had.\n\nShe values this Colombian guy\u2019s DL\u2019s information over our daughter\u2019s safety. So I\u2019m already working on preventing her from taking our daughter on this trip.", "You're definitely doing the right thing. I'm sure your lawyer will say the same thing, but it sounds like you need to go back to court and update the agreement so that it specifically covers things like out of state/international travel, right of first refusal/who can legally watch her if you or your partner can't during your time, etc.", "https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/prevention/passport-issuance-alert-program.html\n\nThis is what you need to fill out and file to flag it.\n\nWhy are you asking for the drivers license? I would want a copy of the current passport. \n\nI think you are still in love with the person your ex wife use to be and the relationship you had so you don't want to make waves. That time is over it's time to make waves, first one being you don't get to leave the country with our daughter.", "Will do! Waiting on the response from my lawyer. Thanks for your many advice! Very much appreciated!", "I appreciate your help with the link. I\u2019ll do that after I get the passport tomorrow from the ex.\n\nAs for still having feelings, you\u2019re right about everything. I still do, maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m not choosing to make waves even after all the pain she\u2019s put me through. I\u2019ve already made up my mind as soon as the divorce happened that I would never accept her back even if she comes back.\n\nIn truth, I think I\u2019m choosing not to make wave more so because she is the daughter of my child. She isn\u2019t a bad mother at all, in fact, she\u2019s a great mother. It\u2019s just this particular issue that is raising alarm because she\u2019s putting her new guy\u2019s information above our daughter\u2019s safety. Which is very concerning and I\u2019ve already made my decision that I\u2019m not allowing her to take our daughter on the trip."]}
