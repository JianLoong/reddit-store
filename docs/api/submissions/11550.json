One of these being her fans have made comments about me that I find highly inappropriate and I don't like.\n\nI've asked my sister multiple times to please edit me out of her videos, or not film me at all. She's told me multiple times she would stop but still includes me in her videos and goes out of her way to still try and film me. my parents have also told her to stop, but they don't see any harm in what she's doing so they have taken a passive role in this. \n\nA few months ago, a graphic designer friend of mine offered to make me some \"not safe for youtube\" shirt designs for me to order from her and I did. It gave me the idea to start acting a bit unhinged and inappropriate for the platform she's trying to make. Nothing of this is inappropriate, mind you. I'm not trying to offend. Most of what I'm doing is conspiracy theory shitposting. My parents even find it entertaining and my father has joined in as well as he also is a bit tired of being filmed. \n\nApparently earlier this week, I got my sister's accounts suspended. One of the shirts I got made has a picture of Ted Kaczynski with the word \"Hero\" under it, and when she was streaming Monday she turned the camera on me to ask me a question. I told her to stop and she continued.  While wearing the shirt I said \"Pay attention, people. Covid was created to hide the truth of 9/11.\" My sister got mad and shooed me away (despite coming to me and trying to film me) and just continued to be annoying in the kitchen. Last night she called my parents up mad because her streaming account got suspended because of me. She also got multiple videos of me wearing that same shirt flagged, putting her youtube account in jeopardy and preventing her from uploading to it for 14 days. \n\nMy parents just told her \"we told you so\" but I got into an argument with her on the phone. I fully believe she is in the wrong for filming me, but I learned that this might completely destroy what she's been building for 2 years now.

You asked her multiple times to not feature you in her videos and she continued doing so without your consent, even after you told her people were making inappropriate comments about you.

Wear a ski mask? So sorry you have a sister who won't respect your boundaries.", "Wow! You went a little extreme there but after repeatedly asking her not to film you I get why you reached a limit.

Sounds like you did everything you could to try to stop this peacefully, and now you're doing what you have to to make it stop.", "NTA as she is ignoring your denial of consent to be filmed.\n\nSoft YTA for the route you took though, as mentioned in other comments conspiring theories can often have very real word themes of racism, queerphobia, antisemitism etc.\n\nThere is a post that gets floated around every couple of years that was written by the child of a mommy blogger. S/he got hoodies and shirts made up that said 'I do not consent to being filmed' (and then got them for their siblings as well)\n\nAlso, if any of the videos where you do this remain up future employers could see them.\n\n\nAnother tip: If your sister has made ANY monetary income from her videos, or got any kind of benefit in kind for what she posts, tell her that you AND your parents are entitled to compensation for your 'involvement' in the posts. Your parents especially as they're the ones footing the utility bills for her cooking in their kitchen for hours on end!", "She saw the shirt before she decided to film - the decision to include you was hers .  NTA", "this is fucking hilarious, NTA", "NTA. Your response is hilarious.", "Play Disney music instead. Your sister could and probably will go back and blur out the images on your shirt. A shirt image she can blur out but she can't edit out music.", "NTA. You told her, she didn't comply. It's not like you're asking a favour. She has no right whatsoever to film you or your parents without your consent. Awful exploitation on her behalf and you would have every right to shut down her channel by legal action. I might have not chosen your way, because it makes you appear crazy, but at least it works.", "NTA. She could have carried on without including people who didn't consent to being participants. You came up with a good solution in my opinion.", "Also she\u2019s USING HIM and HIS REACTIONS to become you tube famous, she sucks. \n\nI\u2019m so over people using videos of others to gain viewers for their own accounts. Be it your family, your children or your classmates, it needs to stop.", "There are so many inappropriate for life Disney shirts available because of all the grown people who fetishize it. You have wardrobe options for weeks.", "NTA but I agree that the conspiracy/unibomber stuff could come back on you at some point.  \n\nGoing forward if she\u2019s dumb enough to try to have you in the videos just keep repeating \u201cI do not consent to being recorded.  I do not consent for my image to be used by you for any purpose.\u201d  And if that doesn\u2019t work, start playing Disney music on your phone.", "Nah, just play Disney music. If it is good enough for the cops trying to hide their abuse, it should be good enough to get out of some cooking TikTok vids.", "If OP chooses the right place to run, they might even help.\n\n\n... :(", "Exactly. This is a FAFO situation if there ever was one.", "This is how I feel. Saying  he didn't wear anything offensive... it's a shirt saying the unibomber is a hero, that is freaking disgusting and slap in the face to the people who died and the people injured.  Leave the house, go to your room, blast Disney music, say you don't like her food on camera, wear a shirt that says\" I do no consent to be filmed\" soooo many other things. She could easily retaliate and post a screenshot of him in the shirt and get him in so much hot water. No one cares if he believes it or not. The image is still there.", "I had to scroll so far to find this I thought I was losing my mind!", "whos ted and what did he do?", "That is where he lost me. That shirt is horrible and it spits in the face of those people he killed and injured. Couldn't op lock himself in his room, leave the house? Play Disney movies? Comment he doesn't like the food or anything else? Stating it isn't offensive is ridiculous.", "Not many people would even give him an interview if they see this kinda thing, it literally gets people kicked out of prestigious schools and companies with no question asked, people don\u2019t like being tied to racist bigoted conspiracy theorists and don\u2019t usually take time to look into a backstory", "I wouldn't. I wouldn't risk it. It looks bad and my job is to protect the company. Lots of candidates who don't love Ted K out there to go with instead. At best, it shows poor judgment in any case.", "NTA  \n\n\nGet graphic designer friend to make a t-shirt saying he doesn't consent to being filmed. T-shirts \"supporting\" the likes of Ted Kaczinsky are going to come back and bite OP on the arse.", "Are you not the reincarnation of the prank sister?", "Ask her how her dui case is going.", "He\u2019s the unabomber\u2014American domestic terrorist", "Another option is to make up shirts that just say \u201cI do not consent to being filmed.\u201d There is nothing controversial about them, but the consent issue is very visible.", "u/Unlikely_Elk9914", "Steamboat Willie is not game JUST yet, believe that goes public domain next year.\n\nWinnie the Pooh hit the public domain scene first.", "I like this one too because it shows her viewers how little she values consent, and her total disregard for others people\u2019s rights in their own home. Hopefully, they would rise up (Rise Up I say!) and put her in her place.", "Eh. I don't think the \"Covid was invented to hide 9/11\" sounds too racist. \n\nNTA\n\nBut the Disney Music blasting is a great idea, because they'll shut that shit down rather than deal with licensing.", "Ah my mistake, good catch", "Wild", "My favorite other than birds is \"ha, you believe in the moon,\"", "Only talk about the glitter shortage.", "Better add some more justification\n\n 9+11=20, what year did covid start? 2020. Coincidence? I think not.", "No worries at all! I\u2019ve been following it for a few years, basically since Disney stopped fighting it. Weird little pet project of mine, haha.", "Every additional comment you make makes me more and more concerned about your understanding of the concept of consent. His communication responsibilities ended at \u201cNo, don\u2019t film me.\u201d Everything that happened after that is on Sis for not accepting OP\u2019s lack of consent."]}
