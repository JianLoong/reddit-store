I still live with my parents while going to college, while sis lives with some friends about a 10-minute drive away. Even though she does not live here, she comes over 2-3 times a week to film for hours in my parent's kitchen. She will make lunch and dinner for my parents and me, but she insists that she includes us in her videos. I'm not comfortable with this for a variety of reasons. One of these being her fans have made comments about me that I find highly inappropriate and I don't like.\n\nI've asked my sister multiple times to please edit me out of her videos, or not film me at all. She's told me multiple times she would stop but still includes me in her videos and goes out of her way to still try and film me. my parents have also told her to stop, but they don't see any harm in what she's doing so they have taken a passive role in this. \n\nA few months ago, a graphic designer friend of mine offered to make me some \"not safe for youtube\" shirt designs for me to order from her and I did. It gave me the idea to start acting a bit unhinged and inappropriate for the platform she's trying to make. Nothing of this is inappropriate, mind you. I'm not trying to offend. Most of what I'm doing is conspiracy theory shitposting. My parents even find it entertaining and my father has joined in as well as he also is a bit tired of being filmed. \n\nApparently earlier this week, I got my sister's accounts suspended. One of the shirts I got made has a picture of Ted Kaczynski with the word \"Hero\" under it, and when she was streaming Monday she turned the camera on me to ask me a question. I told her to stop and she continued.  While wearing the shirt I said \"Pay attention, people. Covid was created to hide the truth of 9/11.\" My sister got mad and shooed me away (despite coming to me and trying to film me) and just continued to be annoying in the kitchen. Last night she called my parents up mad because her streaming account got suspended because of me. She also got multiple videos of me wearing that same shirt flagged, putting her youtube account in jeopardy and preventing her from uploading to it for 14 days. \n\nMy parents just told her \"we told you so\" but I got into an argument with her on the phone. I fully believe she is in the wrong for filming me, but I learned that this might completely destroy what she's been building for 2 years now.

She knows you don\u2019t want to be filmed and does it for her own profit. Would you feel bad if a movie directors and producers made movies and didn\u2019t pay the actors and didn\u2019t even give them a choice in it. You are literally slave labor.", "YTA.  If you didn't want to be recorded, then why didn't you leave.  Unintended consequences can be more devastating than expected.  Do something to save her bacon.", "NTA, but keep in mind that anyone could save screenshots of you in those t-shirts and make trouble for you in the future. I think it's hilarious that your sister is now dealing with the consequences of her own inability to respect other people wanting privacy while at home, but am concerned about the potential consequences for you down the line if those images get into the hands of someone who wants to hurt you. Depending on how spiteful your sister is, if she insists on seeing herself as a victim in this situation, she could send these videos to an employer in the future. If she's twisted enough, it would just be tit for tat for \"ruining her career.\" You'd be better off using tactics that can't be used against you in the future like playing copyrighted music or wearing a t-shirt that says \"I do not consent to being filmed in my home.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She didn't respect your wishes to not appear in her videos, to the point of not editing you out when wearing these shirts and saying these things.

The big asshole here is your sister.  It is unethical (and, depending where you are, illegal) to record people without their permission.   Yet she persists in attempting to record you without your permission.   While there are better, less passive aggressive ways to stop her, your method was rather humorous.

The OP was a girl and her brother would play pranks on her, and their parents refused to step in because his videos were bringing in enough money to pay their bills. OP bought a stereo with wireless speakers and started playing Disney music whenever her brother started filming her. IIRC he tried to break her speakers but the damage was done and he got suspended.

Then she can edit or get her things reported and taken down.", "You are an adult for which lame excuses are inappropriate.", "I've heard Warner are pretty heavy handed, so pick something from that label!", "Well, maybe an adult can choose not to film her brother when she knows he'll say things that could put her channel at risk. Oh, but pointing out the double standard would disrupt your argument so we can't do that.", "Sis is an adult as well.  She also isn\u2019t allowed lame excuses.  She could have easily edited him out or not filmed him at all.  It on her for posting the videos.", "Is op supposed to be able to teleport into the kitchen in only spaces where the camera can't see them to cook and eat. Idk about you but many people like to eat lunch or dinner in the times 12-6. What is the solution for op here? Just not eat until the sister stops using their shared kitchen as her space alone.
