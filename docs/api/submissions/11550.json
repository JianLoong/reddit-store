One of these being her fans have made comments about me that I find highly inappropriate and I don't like.\n\nI've asked my sister multiple times to please edit me out of her videos, or not film me at all. She's told me multiple times she would stop but still includes me in her videos and goes out of her way to still try and film me. my parents have also told her to stop, but they don't see any harm in what she's doing so they have taken a passive role in this. \n\nA few months ago, a graphic designer friend of mine offered to make me some \"not safe for youtube\" shirt designs for me to order from her and I did.

Covid was created to hide the truth of 9/11.\" My sister got mad and shooed me away (despite coming to me and trying to film me) and just continued to be annoying in the kitchen. Last night she called my parents up mad because her streaming account got suspended because of me. She also got multiple videos of me wearing that same shirt flagged, putting her youtube account in jeopardy and preventing her from uploading to it for 14 days. \n\nMy parents just told her \"we told you so\" but I got into an argument with her on the phone.

It sounds like both your mom and dad are tired of being filmed too. You tried to get her to stop by asking. She disregarded that. Now, it\u2019s game on. She only has herself to blame. The easy thing is to stop filming you three.", "NTA at all. You asked her multiple times to not feature you in her videos and she continued doing so without your consent, even after you told her people were making inappropriate comments about you.

Wear a ski mask? So sorry you have a sister who won't respect your boundaries.", "Wow! You went a little extreme there but after repeatedly asking her not to film you I get why you reached a limit.

Whata brilliant solution to the problem of being filmed against your will.  Love it!\n\nNow - NTA, not even a little.   Your sister got what she deserves for not respecting the word NO.  No, you did not do anything to get her suspended from YT, she did that to herself.  She could - and should -  have edited you out.  She chose to keep you in her videos.  That\u2019s on her.

Many employers check social media accounts of potential hires to make sure there's nothing out there that could embarrass the company or even lose them clients.

You could also draw the attention of the Feds, who also aren't going to get the intent and are trained to find social media material that will reveal disturbed people preemptively before they do something.

She's is trying to build a career and it sounds like it was working. Support your family, blah, blah. But! Those inappropriate comments that make you uncomfortable put the kibosh on that.\n\nStick to Disney. The roach comments, etc are funny, but I don't think you want to ruin your sister's career. You just don't want it to be built at your expense. If you and the parents are comfortable with it, maybe let her bring in people that are willing to react on camera to her food.
