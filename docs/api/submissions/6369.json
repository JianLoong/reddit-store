Those animals deserve someone who will take care of them that want to. It sucks but sometimes you have to be the bad guy in someone\u2019s story for the overall benefit.", "NTA. Animal welfare before sisters feelings. You don't torture animals with neglect and claim to care for them.", "NTA, but only if you firstly have an conversation with her and secondly wait until she moves out and if she doesn't take them, then yes 100% find them new homes, they deserve to be treated well.\n\nShe is moving out of home, so she is an adult, and with that comes hard reality, so you AND your mum, must talk to her.", "You haven't given your age, so I guess young adult? Anyway, NTA for wanting those pets to have proper homes, but this needs to be handled by your mum. She's the one who allowed your sister pet after pet, she knows she's not taking care of them, she needs to sort it out.", "NTA - I would sit her down and tell her  you\u2019re going to do it because how she is, if you washed your hands of the pets she will neglect them even more. \n\nRehome them.", "NTA. You and your mother should sit down with your sister and plan this out together. As someone with adhd myself, I understand how taking care of animals can become overwhelming but deep down they\u2019re still adored pets. Going through this process together will hopefully avoid resentment from your sister. I don\u2019t think blindsiding her is a good move on this one.", "YTA to just rehome them without her knowledge. However, you're well within your rights to tell her in so many words that you will NOT accept her leaving them there for you to take care of, and that if she does not take them with her -- every last pet -- then they will be rehomed because that is the appropriate response to pets who are abandoned. Then follow through if she insists on leaving them there anyhow.", "If she doesn't take them with her NTA. If you do it before she leaves YTA.", "NTA. If she is not able to take care of her animals, then it would only make sense to find someone who is. She isn\u2019t taking care of her animals and basically neglects them until she is told to take care of them. They don\u2019t need to be with her. They need to be with someone who will treat them well and not disregard their basic care.", "YWBTA if you didn't.", "NTA. Please do the best for them.", "Firstly, please take the rat to the vet to have his teeth sorted otherwise he won't be able to eat. It should not be expensive. They will just cut the tooth down. They grow continuously so he will die if this is left. If your sister leaves the animals behind then you are entitled to re-home them. It sounds like it is very much in their best interests. NTA", "NTA \n\n\nYour sister's pets need medical attention, or at least the rat with the overgrown incisor. If they're not getting the care they need, they need to go somewhere they will. \n\n\nLiving beings have more needs than just not dying of hunger/starvation. I'm sad for them.", "NTA IF your sister moved out and didn't take them. If you know you are not able to care for them then yes please find them loving homes. However DO NOT do this behind your sister's back. If she is still living with you and your mom then have a conversation about it. You might even just ask your sister if she'd give the pets to you now since you know she's not planning on taking them with her. That way they are yours to find homes for so no stealing or sneaking is involved.", "Tell your sister that when she moved she needs to take all of her pets and if she doesn't you will re-home them within 24 hours of her leaving.. If she tries to call your bluff and moves without taking them re-home them.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s in the pets\u2019 best interest to be taken care of by someone who has the time for them.", "NTA but do make sure that she knows that leaving them behind means that you will wait exactly 1 week before you rehome them.\n\nPut it in writing too. Cc your mother.", "NTA, If your sister is leaving her pets behind without any intent to provide for them, pay them attention, or care for them, she is essentially relinquishing all rights to her pets. She's not fit to claim them if she will not be providing their food, level of care, or attention those pets require. I recommend letting her know this as well as how tired you and your mom are of caring for the pets, and giving her one more opportunity to either take them with her, or find her pets a new owner.  So long as you guys find the pets decent homes/caregivers, you guys are NTA.", "NTA. Normally I'd say YTA for rehoming pets but since she's not caring for them, they're pretty much YOUR pets and you don't want them. Line up homes for the pets and give her a couple days after moving into the new apartment to come and get them, and then find them homes that will care for them.", "NTA. If she leaves them definitely not, if she's not being directly responsible for her pets then you shouldn't be responsible for them. Irresponsibility also really isn't okay when it comes to other living things.", "NTA as a rat owner rehome them to someone that can give them what they need and same for the chinchilla, I'd also wait until she leaves so you are within your rights to rehome them.", "NTA.  It's her responsibility, and she can't just dump them in your lap.  If she abandons them, then the only proper course of action would be to find new homes for them.", "INFO\n\n> but I *believe* \n\nAnd you're not having an actual conversation with her because...?", "NTA. Who would you be being the asshole to in this situation?", "Is it your home?  If not,  YTA. \n\nAnd even if it were,  a warning would be in order\n\n\nWhat you COULD do is simple have the conversion if it is your decision,  either \"this\" or else. \n\n\nOr you just put them in her room and say take care of them or get rid of them. \n\nBut if you give away someone else's pets. You would major be TAH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You don\u2019t know the back story and you should not have to. If you\u2019re a good person all you should care about is giving those pets a good home. It\u2019s a bit trickier for me when they are dropped off at a shelter for my mental gymnastics. This scenario is unfortunate but understandable and it suck\u2019s all around but I\u2019m a bit more hurt when people just give away their animals without even trying to find them a good, safe, replaceable home. Again, some are absolutely necessary\u2026 very hard to keep a cat when you\u2019re living in a tent/on the streets suddenly or hospitalized. You\u2019re also not likely to be able to rehome and they are better off in a shelter. Sorry for the long winded response.", "Thank you for leaving such a sweet comment. It makes me feel a little bit better about this decision.", "I agree with this. You're NTA, OP. Animals in our homes deserve to be treated well and with proper care and respect. I have ADHD too, and I limit how many pets I need to care for (I also have a 3 year old) but I don't forget to take care of them properly. I think the rats and chinchilla would be better off in a different home. It sounds as if she's neglectful of them and gets defensive. Does she play with them? Feed them/water/treats/toys every day? If not, I think they deserve a home where all of their needs are met. \n\nI wouldn't do this behind her back though because it will cause a lot of resentment. I'd talk to her openly and honestly (with your mother) about your concern and suggest helping her find a more suitable home for them now that she's moving out. If she is planning tk take them with her, I'd be concerned they their cages would never be cleaned, she'd forget to feed them, etc. and that just isn't fair to them. Be careful to not attack and be overly critical. Just say \"with everything you have going on, blah blah blah, school/friends/work... wouldn't it be better for the animals to be in another home?\"", "My mother is very uncomfortable with confrontation as someone who grew up in an unstable home, but I'm going to try to encourage all of us to talk about this if I can help it, with some pointers from my therapist. We'll all be better off for it in the end than if I were to try and rehome them without her knowledge.", "Certainly going to be communicating with her throughout all of this before I do anything. The family has had enough miscommunication to last several generations. Not going to perpetuate the cycle if I can help it.", "Will do, I really appreciate the info.", "I can promise you that no matter what happens, moving forward, they're going to be receiving the care they need.", "That's a fair question.\n\nMy mother specifically asked me not to broach the subject with her until she's moved out, and I want to try to respect that; even if I don't agree with it.\n\nStill, I'm going to speak with my therapist about this. My entire approach is half the battle, so I need to deal with this carefully.", "Right, letting the animals die in their own filth is definitily so much better than rehoming them.", "I hope everything goes well and is as painless as possible", "Nta and also do your best to prevent her from adopting a cat. Contact shelters if needed, but let her do it", "If you can convince her to rehome them, thats the best option. \n\nBut NTA even if you have to do it behind her back- people who neglect animals lose their rights to them. If she loves the pets and cant care for them then she should be glad to see them go to someone who can and will.", "I can see why your mum would say that, but honestly it's much fairer to your sister to make sure she knows the consequences of her actions ahead of time, ie that her pets will be rehomed. This means that if it's so important to her to keep them she can change her plans.", "That's what the plan is currently. I'm going to see if I can't get us all together into a big family-meeting-style talk."]}
