Two years ago was my first time going since my husband and I got married right before the world went to shit. We booked a 3 bedroom 1 bathroom air bnb to share with his sister, her husband, their 14 year old and my husband and I. At the time, I didn't know my SIL takes 2-3 hour or longer showers a day. To not give you all a TMI, with 1 bathroom this did not work for my IBS. I ended up shitting myself twice. While BIL was sympathetic, SIL and my nephew have made me the butt of a joke only they think is funny for the past 2 years. Recently, we started booking air bnbs for our family reunion this summer. I insisted on a 2 bathroom home to avoid what happened last time. SIL said it would be too expensive. My husband and I offered to cover the difference in cost between the 1 bathroom place she wanted to rent and the 2 bathroom we wanted. She said we were treating her like a charity case and that what happened to me last time was a \"family bonding experience\".\n\n\nMy husband put his foot down and said he didn't even want to go now, even if we had 2 bathrooms. I know it's selfish but I didn't say anything because SIL has been so awful the thought of spending a week with her sounds like hell.\n\n\n\nA majority of my husband's family is now saying I'm ruining the vacation by manipulating my husband into not going since most of them only see us every 2 years at the reunion. He's told them that's not the case but now we're getting shit on the daily for not going and I feel really shitty. Part of me is wondering if I'm manipulating my husband without realizing it.

WTF is wrong with her?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be going at all to any family functions until I got an apology for what she has put you through and I\u2019d make it clear your never, ever sharing a place again.", "NTA.  No, no, no, you absolutely are not AHs.\n\nYou have a medical condition.  You\u2019re only asking for a very reasonable, necessary accommodation.  You\u2019re offering to cover the extra cost yourselves!

Can't you just get a 1 bathroom rental without SIL and her family?     \n\n\nIn her own words, she doesn't want to be treated like a charity case.  So let her stand proudly on her own two feet, and get a place that will make you and your husband comfortable.\n\n  \nSeems an easy solution.", "NTA!! I'm glad to see your husband standing up for you, and he's doing that all on his own. He sees what AHs his family are, and he's not going to let them bully you anymore.", "NTA I have IBS and I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. Honestly, with the way they\u2019re acting even if they booked a house with two bedrooms I still wouldn\u2019t go. Your SIL and nephew are absolute trash.", "You should tell your SiL to flush her attitude down the toilet while she's taking her 2-3 hour shower, where it belongs.\n\nNTA", "NTA. 2-3 hour showers?? Wtf?? She treats you awfully and make jokes at your expense, you shouldn't have to be around her.", "NTA, sounds like your SIL is the asshole. I\u2019m glad your husband took a stand for you. I think offering to pay the difference for the extra restroom was the best way to solve the problem. SIL wanted her way and couldn\u2019t get it so she tried to make you feel like you did something wrong and probably bitched to the rest of the family about it to manipulate the situation. I\u2019m sorry you were made fun of for having medical problems and that you have such a shitty SIL.", "NTA your husband needs to put his food down with the rest of his family. He should have dealt with his SIL 2 years ago. That isn't family bonding that's bullying. You are doing nothing wrong. SIL is the one ruining things.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nDid your husband shut down his SIL and nephew when they made you the butt of your joke? If not, he\u2019s an AH.", "NTA. Here's a thought, rent a place for you and hubby and let SIL and family split costs with someone else or get their own rental. They don't get to treat you like that, and you shouldn't skip out on things because they are AHs.", "NTA. That\u2019s ridiculous- she takes 1-2 hour showers daily and prevents at least 4 other people from using the bathroom during that time. That\u2019s super inconsiderate, and it led to you pooping yourself since you have a medical issue. She\u2019s completely aware of this and isn\u2019t willing to compromise on a different place with 2 bathrooms even though there was clearly an issue in the past. \n\nI don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to go at all when you\u2019re treated this way by his family.", "NTA. And, honestly, you need to block these family members that are coming at you. You are not manipulating anyone. You have a medical issue, and your SIL is selfish and hogging the bathroom. She wants to humiliate you further.\n\nStand by your husband. Next time, if you both go, get an airbnb just for you guys.", "I mean, it wasn't even your call, it was your husbands.\n\nYou are NTA. \n\nFurthermore, he is NTA.  He's doing a good job sticking up for you and making a stand.", "NTA. With that many people, you need 2 bathrooms! When you\u2019ve got to go- you\u2019ve got to go! Who can wait two hours to use the bathroom? I say if you do go, rent your own place separate from SIL.", "NTA, at all. They sound like terrible people. You and your husband insisting on a 2nd bathroom and offering to pay for it is completely reasonable.", "NTA, this doesn't seem like a family to want to reunite with anyway!", "NTA but his family is. F them.", "Wow, NTA, but SIL definitely is.\n\nIt's hard not to wonder if she knew of your condition last reunion and deliberately took long showers as a passive aggressive thing or just to be the mean girl. Your hubby grew up with her, likely knows her true heart, and may be figuring out that she's passively being mean to you and that's why he doesn't want you to be subjected to her antics.\n\nI wish you well. At the risk of tmi myself i seem to have overactive bladder to the point that often on a travel day, i won't drink and will even eat salty things hoping to retain water. So i  sympathize with visiting, staying other places, and traveling in general.", "NTA. It's not a family bonding moment if they've been making jokes at your expense about your medical condition for two damn years. That's unacceptable and SIL and your nephew are being bullies. And she absolutely refuses to make an accommodation for your medical condition. I wouldn't go, either, but I kind of want you guys to ask her if she'll agree to one shower that lasts no more than 15 minutes per day and see how she responds to an inconvenience. \nYour in-laws are being jerks, and good on your husband for sticking up for you. Tell them you had a terrible experience due to their bad behavior and her intent to replay the situation at the expense of your physical and mental health makes this trip an easy no.", "NTA. You offered a perfectly reasonable solution to what frankly sounds like an awful trip. Any way you and hubs can book a trip somewhere all-inclusive for the 2 of you so that driving isn't an issue? Then you can have a nice vacation!", "NTA.", "Are there hotels or cheaper options in that town ?  I wouldn't house share with that sister. \n\nNTA", "OP as a suggestion just avoid sharing any accommodations in the future with family and if they're not willing to accept the arrangement then potentially just ignore/block them if your husband suggests not interacting with them.  Your SIL is probably looking for an excuse to continue with the microaggressions to make herself feel better in feeding her insecurities, which is pretty sad, but above all else don't put yourself in the situation that's going to make yourself uncomfortable.", "NTA. They are and you shouldn\u2019t go even if there were 5 bathrooms.", "NTA.  Fellow IBS sufferer.  It's not funny.  At all.  May your husband's family get food poisoning and not have enough toilets with their explosive diarrhea.  Or  just bring sugar free gummy bears and watch the shit show.", "NTA. This sounds like a really shitty situation", "None of your puns were funny.", "NTA\n\n\nIt\u2019s sounds like SIL has main character syndrome. She loves being the center and the one everyone has to accommodate and cater to.\n\nHonestly, after the time my husband and I got a stomach flu at the same time, I insisted that from that point forward any place we live must have two bathrooms. Five people sharing one bathroom is just not going to work even without your condition. \n\nYou and your husband don\u2019t need to give her permission to be a brat.", "NTA. You're not skipping because of your IBS. You're missing the family reunion because your SIL refuses to accommodate your disability.\n\nAlso, you're not accidentally manipulating your husband. Manipulation is specifically done on purpose. You can't manipulate by accident.", "NTA and your husband is on your side.

At the air bnb obviously we didn't want to damage the property or else my husband probably would've just broken the lock lol\n\n\n\nMy husband also asked me to add this: don't have 5 kids in a house with only 1 bathroom if you value your life and sanity", "In the city we're doing the reunion in we can't afford a place by ourselves unless it's well outside the city limits.

Monopolizing a single bathroom for 2-3h, totally unreasonable.

I\u2019d say maybe she just hates OP specifically (which may also be true) but I think this is more general since she\u2019s been taking these showers in similar situations knowing she was torturing her family her whole life - why the f her parents let that go on in OP\u2019s husband\u2018s childhood home is insane. And that she continued to do this (with locked door) knowing OP has a medical condition and she made her shit herself AND she thinks that was funny and made fun of them for it for years after???
