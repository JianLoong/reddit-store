You're married to a jealous jerk who resents your joy. This is a far shittier situation than you seem to comprehend. She is reacting negatively to your happiness when it isn't centered around her, this is toxic and unhealthy. She's treating you poorly and her reasoning is disgusting.", "You love your job? What do you do man?", "NTA I was once married to someone who shat on my happiness. I left that marriage a shell of a person.", "I think overall you're not the asshole, but I gotta say this line gave me some pause: \n\n>When I'm at work, that's the happiest I've been in years.\n\nDoes this mean that you're happier at work than you are at home with your wife? Are you expressing this sentiment to your wife? \n\nOn a typical day, how much are you talking about your job to your wife? Do you ask her about her day? \n\nSo...INFO, I guess.", "INFO: how do those conversations go? Does she maybe start complaining about her day at work and when it's your turn to speak you start raving about yours? Or is it not this particular but she shoots you down everytime you say sth positive?", "INFO how is your work life balance? When do you come home from work? Do you ask your wife about her day and what\u2019s bothering her after you\u2019re done being proud of yours?", "NTA if you keep the conversation balanced,  but if you go on about it a lot it could be annoying.", "NTA. I assume you are empathetic and it's not all rainbows and lollipops when you get home. Help her find a better job in a better workplace. She may never be as happy as you are, but she sounds miserable and it's so draining to be in a workplace you hate.", "NTA\n\nMy husband is in a very toxic workplace (prison officer in Australia)\n\nI\u2019m a teacher and work with a fun crew, I come home some days super happy\n\nIt\u2019s a tough one", "There is WAY more to the story here, OP. This isn't just about your wife trying to bring down your happiness. If you are bragging, or droning on and on about how amazing it is, meanwhile, if your wife is trapped in a job she hates, that is very insensitive of you. Have you considered solutions to try and improve your wife's working situation? Does your job keep you out of the house for odd/long hours that she would resent it? Do you put more mental energy into being good at your job than being good at your marriage? Do you ever excitedly talk about how much you love the hobbies you and your wife share, or get excited about things she is interested in? I don't feel like we are getting the whole picture as to why your wife is upset.\n\nNTA for loving your job, but YTA for not realizing that it isn't the job she hates, but the self-centered, insensitive guy ignoring his wife's needs or marital happiness.", "Info: are you simply just talking about your day or are you gloating. I have a feeling it\u2019s the latter.", "NAH. But do you ever show the same kind of love for your wife? And be careful of not bragging about it when someone is trying to talk about the difficulties in their work, that\u2019s the time to listen, not brag.", "Are you the asshole for wanting to share a major part of your life with your life partner??? NTA", "NTA.  If it was a friend or other family member I'd think it would be best to just not discuss your job with them, but this is your spouse.  It's sad that you aren't able to discuss a major part of your life with your wife because she can't see past her own displeasure with her job to be happy for you and your situation.  Would she rather you be miserable like she is?  Your spouse should be the one person you consider your \"safe place,\" where you can share all parts of your life that you want to share, and know that they want what is best for you and who will support you in negative areas and celebrate with you in the positive ones.  You're not wrong to expect to be able to express happiness with your work situation.  In my opinion, she's coming off as selfish for resenting your happiness and making it about her.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with loving your job but if you keep talking about it and bragging about it it makes you sound like a smug ah. I feel like nah just don\u2019t brag about it to wife bc it could get annoying", "NTA. I don\u2019t think enough people love what they do. Im happy for you!", "Not really sure why you'd want to be in a relationship with someone who can't be happy for you and tries to stifle your happiness due to jealousy.", "ESH. OP you sound like me at my previous job. I didn't like my job the last 5 years or so, and my family (including my husband) didn't want to hear my complaints anymore about it. That's what they told me. I appreciate that you love your job, but there needs to be OTHER topics of conversation you have with your wife.", "YWBTA if it was just regular stuff about how your day was, etc.  \nBut if it comes off as bragging you should be more considerate.", "NTA you\u2019re just weird. But good for you. I\u2019d find someone else to tell though for the sake of your relationship.", "You\u2019re not wrong, but your wife isn\u2019t either.\n\nNTA, but stop talking about your amazing job to your wife if you want to see her at her best.", "Your wife would likely hate the job even if she worked at the same place.

She seems bitter/jealous from the info here.\n\nHer attitude could depend on what way/how often you're doing this, as it may come across as bragging or a constant reminder of her job situation - which would definitely be tiring and annoying if it's constant.", "NTA. Your wife hating her job is the problem here and she is taking it out on you, which is AH behavior. She should look around for another job, then she may have good work stories to share as well.", "NTA. Having a job you enjoy is so important for mental health and overall happiness, your wife should be glad and not try to shut you down. Although I\u2019d be a little concerned at at work you\u2019re \u201cthe happiest you\u2019ve been in years,\u201d happier than at home with your family? Maybe if you\u2019re saying stuff like that to her, there\u2019s a reason why it upsets her.", "NTA", "NTA - sounds like your wife needs to polish up her CV.  Remember you work to live, not live to work, and pretty painful existence being miserable in a place you spend so much of your life.", "NTA\nWhen I hated my job my partner would tell me how great his day was or events he was looking forward to and I would complain about my job and it was just a daily thing where we\u2019d recap our day to each other. It\u2019s always been a trade off because he has stressful days too and that\u2019s when I\u2019m there to support him. Sure sometimes I\u2019d get a little jealous but there\u2019s also many aspects of his job I wouldn\u2019t like. While he couldn\u2019t help me get a job as we\u2019re in different industries he did whatever he can to support me while I found a new one and he credits part of his success and achievements to me being there for him. We\u2019re a team.\n\nBUT in saying that we also spend A LOT of time together. Work is important but we\u2019re always each other\u2019s first priority.", "NTA.\n\nYou spend a lot of time at work, so it makes sense to want to talk about it. Also, you can be happy with someone\u2019s job and also be upset about your own circumstances. For example, my brother got a promotion, which I am super happy for him and love talking with him about it, but I am feeling down about my job and where I stand. HOWEVER me being happy for him is not related to my own dissatisfaction in my job. Those are two separate feelings and you don\u2019t need to put someone down to build yourself up.", "NTA. your wife needs therapy to figure out why she wants everyone around her to be as miserable as she is.", "NTA, she\u2019s just jealous. Is she looking for a new job or is she just stewing and trying to bring you down. Regardless it doesn\u2019t giver her the right to talk to you that way just because she\u2019s upset.", "YTA. You sound insufferable. Good for you for having a great job. Leave work at work and try talking to your wife about anything else.", "I mean with a wife like that I'm not surprised he's happiest at work", "Right?! I need to know. It\u2019s been so long since I didn\u2019t dread going into work haha", "I've found that when you work with good people who are fun to be around and respect you and your skills, what you actually do isn't even that important.", "Well\u2026 it\u2019s hard for OP to win here. if he offers solution, guess what people will say he\u2019s overstepping because his wife only wants a listening ear. Work takes a very big part of an adult person\u2019s life that it\u2019s hard not to talk about it.", "Do you think it's fair that the expectation is that he'll only see his wife at her best if he hides his happiness?", "I work in finance.", "It\u2019s possible, but the point I\u2019m trying to make is that he at least has to try.  If he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019s staring at divorce.", "I think it's the opposite...I think that if he doesn't work out her inability to be happy for him, he's staring at divorce.  If you have to stifle your happiness in order to stay married, you're married to the wrong person.", "The problem is he\u2019s already married.  Ideally OP should\u2019ve figured this out before tying the knot.  Divorce costs a lot of time, money, and aggravation.  It would serve him well to throw the kitchen sink at making this work before divorcing.", "Of course it would, I'm pretty sure we're saying the same thing there...it's better to make the marriage work than to end up divorced...we're just disagreeing on the best way of doing it.  If he has to stifle his happiness to make it work, it's not actually working.  Having to pretend that you're not happy in order to keep your spouse happy is exactly the kind of thing that leads to divorce, not avoids it...unless \"making it work\" translates to just remaining married, rather than happily so.  To me, \"making it work\" would be both parties being able to be themselves and not have to pretend to feel or not feel something.  They need to get to a place where she doesn't resent him being happy simply because she isn't happy.  That's not a healthy relationship."]}
