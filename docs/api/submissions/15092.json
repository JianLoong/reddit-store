Are you expressing this sentiment to your wife? \n\nOn a typical day, how much are you talking about your job to your wife? Do you ask her about her day? \n\nSo...INFO, I guess.", "INFO: how do those conversations go?

I assume you are empathetic and it's not all rainbows and lollipops when you get home. Help her find a better job in a better workplace. She may never be as happy as you are, but she sounds miserable and it's so draining to be in a workplace you hate.", "NTA\n\nMy husband is in a very toxic workplace (prison officer in Australia)\n\nI\u2019m a teacher and work with a fun crew, I come home some days super happy\n\nIt\u2019s a tough one", "There is WAY more to the story here, OP. This isn't just about your wife trying to bring down your happiness. If you are bragging, or droning on and on about how amazing it is, meanwhile, if your wife is trapped in a job she hates, that is very insensitive of you. Have you considered solutions to try and improve your wife's working situation? Does your job keep you out of the house for odd/long hours that she would resent it? Do you put more mental energy into being good at your job than being good at your marriage? Do you ever excitedly talk about how much you love the hobbies you and your wife share, or get excited about things she is interested in? I don't feel like we are getting the whole picture as to why your wife is upset.\n\nNTA for loving your job, but YTA for not realizing that it isn't the job she hates, but the self-centered, insensitive guy ignoring his wife's needs or marital happiness.", "Info: are you simply just talking about your day or are you gloating. I have a feeling it\u2019s the latter.", "NAH. But do you ever show the same kind of love for your wife?

NTA", "NTA.  If it was a friend or other family member I'd think it would be best to just not discuss your job with them, but this is your spouse.  It's sad that you aren't able to discuss a major part of your life with your wife because she can't see past her own displeasure with her job to be happy for you and your situation.  Would she rather you be miserable like she is?  Your spouse should be the one person you consider your \"safe place,\" where you can share all parts of your life that you want to share, and know that they want what is best for you and who will support you in negative areas and celebrate with you in the positive ones.  You're not wrong to expect to be able to express happiness with your work situation.  In my opinion, she's coming off as selfish for resenting your happiness and making it about her.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with loving your job but if you keep talking about it and bragging about it it makes you sound like a smug ah.

That's what they told me.

She should look around for another job, then she may have good work stories to share as well.", "NTA.

It\u2019s always been a trade off because he has stressful days too and that\u2019s when I\u2019m there to support him. Sure sometimes I\u2019d get a little jealous but there\u2019s also many aspects of his job I wouldn\u2019t like. While he couldn\u2019t help me get a job as we\u2019re in different industries he did whatever he can to support me while I found a new one and he credits part of his success and achievements to me being there for him. We\u2019re a team.\n\nBUT in saying that we also spend A LOT of time together. Work is important but we\u2019re always each other\u2019s first priority.", "NTA.\n\nYou spend a lot of time at work, so it makes sense to want to talk about it. Also, you can be happy with someone\u2019s job and also be upset about your own circumstances. For example, my brother got a promotion, which I am super happy for him and love talking with him about it, but I am feeling down about my job and where I stand. HOWEVER me being happy for him is not related to my own dissatisfaction in my job. Those are two separate feelings and you don\u2019t need to put someone down to build yourself up.", "NTA. your wife needs therapy to figure out why she wants everyone around her to be as miserable as she is.", "NTA, she\u2019s just jealous. Is she looking for a new job or is she just stewing and trying to bring you down. Regardless it doesn\u2019t giver her the right to talk to you that way just because she\u2019s upset.", "YTA. You sound insufferable. Good for you for having a great job. Leave work at work and try talking to your wife about anything else.", "I mean with a wife like that I'm not surprised he's happiest at work", "Right?! I need to know. It\u2019s been so long since I didn\u2019t dread going into work haha", "I've found that when you work with good people who are fun to be around and respect you and your skills, what you actually do isn't even that important.", "Well\u2026 it\u2019s hard for OP to win here. if he offers solution, guess what people will say he\u2019s overstepping because his wife only wants a listening ear. Work takes a very big part of an adult person\u2019s life that it\u2019s hard not to talk about it.", "Do you think it's fair that the expectation is that he'll only see his wife at her best if he hides his happiness?", "I work in finance.", "It\u2019s possible, but the point I\u2019m trying to make is that he at least has to try.  If he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019s staring at divorce.", "I think it's the opposite...I think that if he doesn't work out her inability to be happy for him, he's staring at divorce.  If you have to stifle your happiness in order to stay married, you're married to the wrong person.", "The problem is he\u2019s already married.  Ideally OP should\u2019ve figured this out before tying the knot.  Divorce costs a lot of time, money, and aggravation.  It would serve him well to throw the kitchen sink at making this work before divorcing.", "Of course it would, I'm pretty sure we're saying the same thing there...it's better to make the marriage work than to end up divorced...we're just disagreeing on the best way of doing it.  If he has to stifle his happiness to make it work, it's not actually working.  Having to pretend that you're not happy in order to keep your spouse happy is exactly the kind of thing that leads to divorce, not avoids it...unless \"making it work\" translates to just remaining married, rather than happily so.  To me, \"making it work\" would be both parties being able to be themselves and not have to pretend to feel or not feel something.  They need to get to a place where she doesn't resent him being happy simply because she isn't happy.  That's not a healthy relationship.", "NTA\n\nIs your wife always this bitter?", "Hey, it's so refreshing to see people loving their jobs! I love mine too, so it's a NTA from me! Keep enjoying!!!", "We\u2019re all human. Have I felt jealous of how wonderful my partner\u2019s company culture and reward system is? Yes. Have I sulked or killed his joy when said joy also benefits me (happy wife happy life is not true just for wives)? Absolutely not. It brings me joy when his eyes light up. It\u2019s time for your wife to have a hard conversation with herself and decide what she can do to improve her own work life. NTA.", "NAH\nI see how she's being a buzzkill but also how it comes off as rubbing it in", "INFO: There really isn\u2019t a lot of background information but it sounds like you\u2019re wife wishes she had a job that made her as happy as you. And it sounds like you aren\u2019t being perceptive of that and being mindful of how she\u2019s feeling with her profession. She also needs to have compassion for you. I\u2019m curious in the way you are not shy about it. Do you talk about the fun parts of your day or do you just go on about how you love it and all the perks? Because she should listen and be excited for you but I can see her feeling like it\u2019s too much if you consistently do the latter. Does she want a new job? Can she get a new job?", "NAH\n\nLook it's awesome that you love your job. It's a rare thing and it's something to be grateful for.\n\nIt sounds like your wife hates her job - or at least doesn't like it. \n\nSo when you come home and start telling her how amazing your job is you are rubbing it in her face. Do you ever listen to her and ask how her day was? Do you support her and prop her up so that she can face going back to her job every day? \n\nIn another comment you said you took a pay cut to take this job. Does that mean she has to shoulder more of the financial burden so that you can be happy? \n\nMaybe come home and put work away. Focus on your wife and start treating her like she's something to be happy about.", "YTA because of the way you handle it. do you think anyone, after a shitty day at work, doing a job they clearly don't like, wants to hear just how awesome of a time your having? because you ARE rubbing it in your wifes face. Im not saying you cant ever talk about how much you like your job, but its SO tone deaf to go on and on about just how awesome where you work is when your wifes in a shitty workplace. maybe work together to get her a job that's more enjoyable instead of just goading over her?", "NTA OP.  If she doesn\u2019t like the fact that you love your job, then perhaps you should reconsider your relationship.", "INFO, what is your job?", "Not OP, but I love the shit out of my job and I'm Internal IT Help Desk for a toy company.  Probably helps that this is the first job I've had in 18+ years where I don't wake up in pain every day.", "Civil Engineering. Shifted to a larger office and salary to smaller one and lower salary because I liked the newer people.", "Maybe she's resentful because op is happier away from her at work then when they are together", "Curious as well. I have loved many of my jobs and did realize that when my wife was sharing how hard her day was, it was not a good move to jump in with how great mine was right away. More about the delivery of my great day vs having one. But she did love that I was happy at work and would attend every work event that invited family.", "Are you happier away from your husband?", "Of course not", "Why would he be happy at home? He said he happiest at work", "Maybe she wants him to be happy at home", "> Probably helps that this is the first job I've had in 18+ years where I don't wake up in pain every day.\n\nIs that because IT isn't as physically demanding as past jobs? I like mine (library clerk) partly because it's light walking inside.", "\ud83d\udc80", "Of course it makes sense to talk about your day and work, totally normal. But it entirely depends on circumstances we don't know as to why she is *upset* by this. Maybe he quit a well paying job to follow his dream and now she is stuck in a job she hates because she is forced to be the breadwinner and there is resentment. Maybe he could be a little more tactful in how he talks about his great day if he knows her day was miserable; a little self awareness and consideration goes a long way.\n\nIf OP's wife's job really isn't working out for her, they should be working on solutions *together* to figure out how to improve things. Make an actionable plan for her to switch jobs, cut back hours, or get more training to find something she enjoys. It is not overstepping to propose a solution that could make her happy too. When it comes to careers, the family finances, and supporting each other, these are often decisions that should be made together. It is not overstepping.", "Where did he say that he wasn't happy at home?  \n\nAlso, if she wants him to be happy at home, maybe the first step to getting that would be to not make him feel bad for enjoying his job, and not expecting him to stifle his feelings and instead feel grateful that he's not coming home in a lousy mood every day because he's stuck in a job he hates.", "Lmao", "F", "He did say in another comment that he took a pay cut to take this job so I'm sure that plays a part in it. \n\nHe conveniently left that out of his original post.", "Well he says he is at his happyest at work so therefore the only logical conclusion one can make is he is less happy at home. This can further be shown to be the case by having the other person who lives at home show frustration at op for saying how happy he is to not be at home", "i genuinely cannot find the comment youre talking about, but why should that even matter?\n\nOP has a job they love, in a company they love. thats worth a lot more than extra cash. id absolutely kill for a job i love right now, even if it meant i make less money than i potentially could.", "Interesting. I wonder if him taking a pay cut meant she had to stay at her hated job to make ends meet?", "Would you be thrilled if your partner was happier at work then when you", "It might matter if the wife is having to pick up the slack financially and it's putting more pressure on her. Then he comes home gushing about how amazing his job is while she's having to work that much harder.\n\nThat might not be the case but it's something to consider in the whole scenario.", "I would be thrilled if my partner was happy at work.  Period.  It's something that he spends the majority of his waking hours doing, of COURSE I would be thrilled to know that he spent that time happy.  It would make no difference whether or not my own job did that for me.  His being unhappy at work won't make me happier with my own job, and wishing for him to be unhappy or resenting the fact that he is happy is unhealthy and hurtful.  He shouldn't have to pretend to be unsatisfied with his job to placate her jealousy and resentment.", "Once again just in case you missed it. You don't want your partner to be happy to be around you?", "The OP didn't say he wasn't happy to be with his partner.  Being happiest at work doesn't mean he's not happy with her, and perhaps he would be happiest with her if she wasn't jealous and resentful of him finding joy in his career.  It's hardly his fault if he finds more happiness at work than at home, if home isn't a happy place to be."]}
