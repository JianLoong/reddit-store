If he has to stifle his happiness to make it work, it's not actually working.  Having to pretend that you're not happy in order to keep your spouse happy is exactly the kind of thing that leads to divorce, not avoids it...unless \"making it work\" translates to just remaining married, rather than happily so.  To me, \"making it work\" would be both parties being able to be themselves and not have to pretend to feel or not feel something.

It's bittersweet, but I'm going to keep working at this job as long as it remains feasible financial-wise since I actually feel at home there. Plus side is that it's a 2 minute walk from where I live.\n\nEdit: going to clarify, but I've never had a job before now that I love.. I'm 31 and have been working since I was 15, so yeah lol", "maybe he's happier at work because she wants him to be miserable \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Hmm okay, then rather NTA. Sounds like your wife is going through something not necessarily job-related.. Maybe a general dissatisfaction with life and you can only help her so much.", "I'm going to say ESH. This doesn't appear to be about the fact you love work, it seems to be more about your marriage in general?", "It really sounds like you should put the effort into having better talks with your wife. You just said that you like work because there are no problems you can't fix with logic, but the problems at home are due to a lack of understanding that logic can't fix everything in said home. You can't talk to your wife without it coming across as an attack. Why not? You know the person you chose to spend the rest your life with is an emotional being and instead of trying to being flexible your response is, \"I'm just a logical person.\" Well, shit, didn't y'all think about that before you got married? I think there is NAH. I think you and your wife have to find a way to get on same page.", "Do you know you sound like an asshole here? You suck at showing your wife you love her and you love bragging and showing off. I can see more and more why your wife is frustrated and pissed off with you.", "I also work in finance but I love my job lol", "Yeah, won\u2019t work for you I\u2019m afraid", "It's 100% that. I went from a cook/kitchen manager working 8-18 hour days to 9 hour days at a desk and walking around a production facility. I don't ever have to lift 50 pound bags of anything, let alone over a dozen twice a week. It's a lot of little things, but this is so much more rewarding than cooking anymore.", "It genuinely is interesting, and challenging, and every day I get to try new fresh hellscapes of human stupidity. At least they don't throw things at me.", "If everyone is having a good time and there is no bad blood anywhere, this usually means that people share senses of humor and discuss topics that could very well land everyone in hot water if something gets taken the wrong way or an outside person hears what is going on and takes offense.\n\nIt's either the sign of a toxic workplace, or one of the rare \"perfect\" ones where everyone just syncs and even if the topics are NSFW nobody is feeling hurt and nothing bad is happening.", "They are making inappropriate remarks to each other that are grounds for being reprimanded by HR or fired for saying to coworkers. Probably a lot of \u201clocker room\u201d talk.", "I'm fucking cackling at work", "Reminded of something from Hunger Games, Peeta and his family as bakers are muscular from constantly hauling big sacks of flour and have burn scars from the ovens\n\nOne of my middle school classmates was a chef and now isn't, I think he liked the cooking itself but found the industry too stressful.", "> try new fresh hellscapes of human stupidity\n\nYou already said \"IT Helpdesk\".", "I actually got a raise to come to this position and it meant being home 100% of the time rather than traveling 80%. I'm currently making about 70% of our annual income. I said that my wife turned down a position because it would have cut her pay by about $2/hr.", "I'm happiest on vacation, that doesn't mean I'm not happy when I'm home.", "The OP didn't say that he was happy not to be at home.  He said he was happiest at work.  There is a BIG difference between those two statements.  I love a good burger.  I love a good steak even more.  That doesn't mean that I'm not still thrilled with a burger when I have it.  \n\nThe OP said that his wife is jealous because his company has a strong culture and the company she works for does not.  You are making assumptions and changing the entire situation by making it out like he's not happy at home, and that THAT is why she's angry.\n\nShe's angry that he's happy at work and she isn't.  It's jealousy, and it's an unhealthy situation.  You should never wish that your spouse was miserable all day just so that they'd be happier to be at home than at work.", "Yeah. I had no desire to be a chef. The stress of being a kitchen manager was crazy enough, I don't want to be in charge of making a menu too.", "Internal IT Help desk. I don't have to deal with the general public, and I'm on a first name basis with every manager in the company because, shocker, our 3-person help desk spends a lot of time helping the higher ups. If people get upset, I can have the VP of HR on the phone in \\~30 seconds to explain that they should probably be more polite and civil unless they'd like to go find a new job.", "My bad. I must have read someone else's comment and mistaken it for yours.", "You have no indication that she has to work harder for whatever reason though. You're just assuming that because he took a pay cut, an amount of which you're not even sure he actually took. He could have taken the $2,000 annual pay cut, that's not going to cause a major change in their budget.", "[removed]", "I\u2019m saying that if that was the case I\u2019d be looking at why he is happier there, rather than being jealous and sulking and expecting him to pretend he isn\u2019t.  That solves nothing. If she wants him to be happiest at home, then she should allow home to be a place where he can be happy.", "NTA- Speaking as someone who has the most fun job in the whole world (if you are very specifically me and exactly that kind of batshit bobot), sing it out! Until this job I thought every company was a steaming pile of hellhound dung, if only I'd heard more people talking about how it didn't have to be that way I'd have moved to this company years before I did.", "Mayabe you should start complaining about  your job.  It sounds like your wife would be much happier if she thought you were miserable.  She sounds like a lovely person. /s  NTA.  If I didn't like my job as much as I do, I might feel envious of you... but I wouldn't get angry at you just because you're happy.  She should be happy for you,and doing something about either finding a new job. NTA", "NTA. In expressing your love of your work experience, you are radiating joy. Keep that up! Jealousy is a toxic choice. Wife needs to unlearn that behavior and embrace your happiness.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s off.\n\nLook, I\u2019m working as a chef in a cafe. It\u2019s not where I thought I\u2019d be as I wanted my own place or more creative control but I still love my job. I love the people I work with, I love being close to my kid\u2019s school. I love the flexibility. \n\nMy DH doesn\u2019t like his job as much and has to travel to get there but thankfully wfh most of the week. It\u2019s more stressful but it\u2019s more security. We\u2019ve talked about him finding something nearby but he stays still as the pay is good and he does like his team. \n\nIs he jealous?? \nNo. He\u2019s happy I\u2019m happy. He even pops by and my colleagues love him.\n\nIf he was acting the way your wife is, I\u2019d be telling him to sort his damn CV out and sort his shit out and find a freaking job he does like. Not to be a jealous child and make his issue mine.", "Good for you!  No one needs a partner who wants to rob you of your joy. \n\nIt sounds like she has a bad job, but rather than making a change to something better she wants him to gets something worse. That way, they are both equally unhappy.   NTA.  It\u2019s worth considering if this is an isolated problem or a pattern.", "I lost my dream job a few years ago to disability (not work related). It was just like this. I genuinely enjoyed working so much. \n\nLuckily my current job is enjoyable (although it's WFH), it's just not enough hours.", "right?!!! She sounds bitter and unsupportive.", "When she's looking for empathy are you giving advice, problem solving or mansplaining? Because she may just want and need you to *sympathize* with her. Not try to fix it, not try to explain it, not try to tell her what to do. \n\nAnd if you guys are \"walking HR violations\", that might lead to some of her concerns, don't you think?", "Sounds like a lot of communication issues in general. My wife and I started couples therapy to work on our communication and improving it, not really because there was one big issue but because we noticed a pattern. Maybe approaching it as a We issue will help- that you feel both of you could improve, and that you\u2019d like to be a better husband and communicator.", "Couples therapy. You're most likely not more logical, you just shut down in the face of emotion and that makes you feel like the superior one when your wife gets upset at shit. My husband had the same perception of himself and didn't have the emotional intelligence to figure out that emotions are normal and you can't logic yourself out of them, if you choose not to deal with them, you're only shoving them down and making a bigger problem for yourself later.", "My husband is the personification of \"follow your bliss.\" He practically glows as he works from task to task. And yeah, I would get a little impatient with him since I was in a grind of a job. \nBut the biggest problem we had to work through was that when it came time for my turn to talk about my day, he had absolutely no clue what I was going through. I'd complain about a coworker and he'd say, totally serious, \"just tell her to go f herself.\" Like that is ever an option in an office setting. \nSo I'm wondering if part of your wife's issue is that she can't or doesn't feel she can vent about her problems at work.", "My condolences.", "Lol, my partner and I had to have some talks about that. He works in a skilled trade. I work in an office. He would absolutely give me that same kind of advice - \"well tell her to get her shit together\" - and I had to explain that that shit may fly on the shop floor but I'd find myself out of a job if I talked to coworkers in my office like that."]}
