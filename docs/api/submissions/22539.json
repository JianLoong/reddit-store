Saying you dont care about someones opinion because they are not attractive is a bullshit thing to say to anyone - even though she was an idiot as Well. \nSo everyone sucks, i get why you are not liking this girl, she sounds annoying to be around, But fighting stupid comments with stupid comments is not the Way to go.", "ESH Pretty obvious why she\u2019s an AH, but I\u2019d like to clarify my judgment about you. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re TA because you were mean to her. In fact, I think people who are AHs in general should be put in place. While she may have trauma, that doesn\u2019t give her the right to be mean to you, or any decent man just because he\u2019s male. \n\nHowever, you\u2019re an AH for using her attractiveness as the barometer for whether her opinion is of value. You only made yourself sound shallow with that statement when it doesn\u2019t even seem to be the main reason for why you don\u2019t want to listen her. She\u2019s an AH, and you think she\u2019s biased. If you had said something like that, you would\u2019ve been completely off the hook. Instead, you say that her being unattractive to you means her input means nothing. Well, in the real world, a lot of people who may be unattractive to you might actually have a keen sense of what attracts women. For example, a completely androgynous woman may not be attractive to you, but she might know what other women like, so disregarding her opinion just because of her looks would be superficial on your part.", "Sounds like she has some trauma caused by men and is just projecting it on every man she crosses paths with. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with that.", "NTA\n\nYou just said that you don't care about her opinion on your clothes. You don't dress for her approval; you don't want it because she's unattractive to you. That's fine. Maybe a bit harsh and unnecessary, but it wasn't unprovoked. You didn't say her opinion about anything doesn't matter.\n \nJust don't engage with her, if possible. Don't stoop to her level.", "[deleted]", "ESH.  it is probably best to get better friends if this is your circle.", "ESH you both are insulting each other for no apparent reason, it\u2019s just immature", "ESH. You both said some sexist shit. She\u2019s generally right about how most men act but she shouldn\u2019t have commented on your clothing. You implied that a woman\u2019s opinion doesn\u2019t matter unless she\u2019s attractive.", "ESH. While yes, she needs to learn that not everyone will appreciate or tolerate her attitude & behavior, *you* shouldn't have even responded to her. Like someone else said, you shouldn't stoop to her level. Next time, just try to ignore her. I would say pretend like she's not even there, but that would probably result in a similar response.", "To a certain degree you\u2019re an AH. If you already know that she has certain stigma about men and how men treats her then your statement did not prove her wrong or changed her point of view about men. Acting negatively towards something negative does not give you a positive outcome. There are ways to answer her statement without looking like an AH.", "NTA. She needs to learn that there are many people who won't find her attractive. As we each have our own definition of what we consider beautiful and ugly. Though for her sake, she best learn when to keep her mouth shut and not to insult people. Because trust me, with an attitude like that, she's gonna get herself into trouble. As not everyone will be so tolerant of her arrogance and ignorance.", "NTA, but in the future, a more diplomatic way to say that could be \u201cI\u2019m not trying to impress you, so that\u2019s fine.\u201d It\u2019s a polite middle finger to her.", "ESH her for generalizing and being cruel to you. You for continuing to be around her and for discrediting her opinion because she's unattractive.", "ESH\n\nYou could have taken the high road and proved that you\u2019re better than she thinks men are.\n\nBut you chose to reinforce her beliefs and took the low road.", "NTA\n\nShe's sexist. Cut her out. Also, you're not dressing for her, so she can keep her mouth shut. It's just like when a man starts in on how a woman's clothing is wrong. You're not looking to attract her, you're just doing what makes you happy. If she wants to dish it, she can't be mad when it gets returned.", "ESH. You're probably worse though, if you're telling this to her face whereas she generalizes.", "YTA. You invalidated her opinion on fashion based on her appearance \n\nBe better", "how are you sexist for not finding her attractive?", "NTA - someone insufferable like they deserve some comebacks. It\u2019s not wrong to let her have a taste of her own medicine regardless if it lands you in the ESH territory. Fact is the high road is only for try hards that likes to judge ppl at their expense. In most ppl\u2019s books it\u2019s to be a justified AH by saying something mean in retaliation just to get them to back off, however she takes it is on her. It hurt her feelings? Tough luck cause that\u2019s only a little bit of retaliation.", "She doesn\u2019t sound like a friend", "NTA - why is she able to comment on your appearance, and call you sexist when you say you didn\u2019t ask \ud83d\ude02", "YTA you proved her right dumbass.", "NTA.

This is stupid and indeed a bit sexist usually.\n\nWhen the discussion is on what someone should do to seem more attractive, attractive people are more correct.

You're only feeding her skewed view of men. Now for someone her age to hate men so much is a big red flag. I don't know if you realize it, but to me it comes off as her being deeply traumatized by an encounter with a man. She might have been abused or sexually assaulted to have that much vitoral all the time. In which case, she needs a lot of help instead of judgement. Talk to your other female friend, and tell her that you need some distance from this girl until she can get some help. You don't have to get into details as to why.

She has some serious issues to figure out.", "Because being \u201cugly\u201d or \u201csexy\u201d doesn\u2019t change a woman\u2019s taste in men. In fact, a woman who is less attractive, is more likely to have lowered her standard in the looks department (hopefully not in the personality department). So if a less attractive woman is telling you something looks bad, then a \u201csexy\u201d woman is not likely to like it. Also, their attractiveness according to your eyes does not change their taste. \n\nThem being a raging man hater might.
