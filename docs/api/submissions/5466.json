Mom delivered a very long and heartfelt speech about how glad she was to be in his life, how she was so glad life worked out the way it had and that she wouldn't change the events of her life because they were worth it to get these moments of perfection and how we as a family were all so grateful and glad our lives had turned out as they had. She was crying, her husband was crying and stepbrother and his wife were crying. But my brother, sister and I felt her words like a slap in the face. To get this \"perfect family\" we had to lose our dad suddenly, and it also meant being torn away from the place we felt most at home because mom couldn't stand being there and took us away from family and friends. To hear her say she was glad everything happened, glad dad died... my siblings and I could not shake that. Mom was glowing and gushing the whole rest of the wedding and the next day she was upset that we didn't go to hang out with her and her husband. She asked us what happened and why we'd acted like we were caught between crying and getting mad most of the wedding. My brother told her that her little speech was fucked and how she was so glad dad was dead, maybe we didn't want to spend any time with her. She was all flustered and tried to say we were overreacting and taking it the worst way instead of the best way which is how she meant it.\n\nWhat followed was a couple of weeks of no talking. Then she found out the three of us were talking to each other about it and she got mad at us and said we had no right to try and make her feel guilty for her speech. I told her that she should not have spoken for us as a family and did she really think we agreed that the family was perfect? Did she really believe her three children who lost their dad, their only dad, would say they wouldn't change a thing? She told me we don't only have one father. That we have two and were blessed with a bigger family out of a loss. I told her it didn't take from the fact we would change that in a heartbeat and we would keep our dad regardless of whether her husband and his son came into our lives or not. I told her she had to see how it would hurt us to hear those words. I brought up that nobody else made a speech like it. And how we had to try and act okay through it all to not cause a scene while we had our hearts ripped out. She said yet again how we saw the worst in it and how she was speaking for herself. I told her no, she spoke about the whole family feeling that way and she had no right to do that.\n\nShe told me I had no right to speak to her the way I was and that I was just trying to make her words bad instead of good. She told the three of us that we were being spiteful and taking our grief about dad out on her and she wasn't going to tolerate it.\n\nHer husband and our stepbrother learned about the argument and they're annoyed at us for being upset also.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671813066, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztljk5/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_had_no_right_to_speak/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To say your mother is clueless is an understatement. I guess she has moved on to her new family and the fact you called her out on it, is making her feel bad, well good. Time to leave her with her new family and cut her off.", "NTA\n\nGuess she chose what  family is most important to her. I'm sorry for your loss. She made you and your siblings emotional orphans. Then invalidates all of your feelings. Then sends her new family to double down.\n\nYeah, I'd be keeping my distance, too.", "NTA I don't know what I would do if I were you.", "Wow wow wow. NTA! I\u2019m sorry you lost your dad. I\u2019m glad you have your siblings for support. \n\nIt almost sounds like your mom feels guilty for finding love again. There were a billion ways she could have expressed how much she loves her step kid without disrespecting you guys.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYour mother, unfortunately, shows a remarkable lack of empathy toward you and your siblings. It sounds like she might be a narcissist, focusing only on her own feelings. She appears completely blind to the hurt and loss you've suffered from losing your dad.\n\nI hope she manages to see your point of view some day. But with her husband and stepson enabling her and taking her side, it seems unlikely.\n\nIt's great that the three of you have each other. I wish you happiness in the future.", "NTA \n\nYou have a right to express your hurt feelings. Her words were tactless and definitely shows that she is a self centered person with little or no empathy for anyone but having said that to have no empathy for the hurt caused by her words and not apologising is really really indicative that there is Zero self reflection\u2026.\n\nGlad you and your siblings have each other\u2019s back", "NTA\n\nShe may have been well-intentioned with her speech but the fact she doubled down once she realized how hurt you were says it all. Personally, hearing those words, I would feel gutted as well.

She owes you an apology which she is too clueless and most likely to selfish to give you all. Enjoy your relationship with your siblings, keep your mom at arms lenght. Maybe try and spend time with your dad's extended family during the holidays so you can actually grieve and remember him with people that still care about him along with your siblings. \n\nNTA", "i notice you said twice that your mother was glad your dad was dead. did she actually say that? did she mention your dad at all in her speech?", "NTA\n\nThere was a post a while ago, where this kid's dad kept saying that he was glad the past was the past cause it lead to him getting this new family. This also lead to the OPs younger half-sibling saying they were happy OPs mom died.\n\nIt did not end well. \n\nIf you can find it. I'd show your mom that one.", "Nta\n\n\nTo say that she was glad how things happened exactly how they happened is messed up.\n\n\nIt's fine to love your stepson and husband it's abothing thing to say what she said.\n\n\nShe could have said how much they meant to her as family but instead completely overlooked the circumstances especially in front of her children.", "NTA.

Ngl if my dad had done that after we lost mom\u2026. Damn I wouldn\u2019t have been able to hold that in and would have told him On the spot that I did most certainly Not agree. \n\nI admire your restraint on not calling her out then and there, nor just walking out.", "NTA.

Your mother has clearly moved on from your father's loss. She loves her new husband and stepson. She came through a terrible time of loss and gained family. She wanted to share her happiness about this. That's all understandable. BUT she clearly did not consider you and your siblings' feelings. She was not purposely cruel, but she was  thoughtless. You and your siblings' feelings are valid and your pain is real. She hurt you and you are right to hold her accountable for that.", "YTA. You twisted her words and applied intentions that were not there. Your father loss was out of her control.  If she could have him back she probably would in a \u2764\ufe0f beat. That's not possible. Yes.  She had choice to move on or not. She did.  She found happiness.  Her intentions were not, she is glad your father is dead. She is glad she was given a second chance. Would you have preferred she stay single and lonely, struggling to work 3 jobs to give you some semblance of family.  Your  twisting and turning a a knife, you feel she deserves to have plunged into her soul that she dared to find a life after the loss of dreams of the family she lost.", "NAH. \nThese are things people routinely say in moments like this and adults understand that it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s glad someone died, but that despite awful things happening that good things happen too. This is a core belief that keeps people going through hard times and was appropriate to say at such an important event.\n\nAnd if she is religious or spiritual, your dad\u2019s death was part of the series of events that led to this moment and it was preordained. \n\nThe only reason this is NAH and not y-t-a is because you sound young and your grief is valid, but so is her joy in finding happiness after her pain.", "NAH\n\nThere are some people who believe that everything that happens in our lives leads to the current moment we are in, meaning the happiness she feels would not have happened without everything else. You are married now and love your husband, but had certain things happened (good and bad) in your life, do you think you'd be with that particular person? That seems how she views things and that's fine. Who knows how her relationship with your dad and maybe the stepdad is her true love. \n\nBut it's also ok for you to be upset that she said \"we are grateful\" instead of \"I am\". But it seems like even if she said during the speech that it was only her feelings, you and your siblings would still feel slighted.", "May I offer a perspective. For background my father died of cancer when my sister and I were children. My stepsisters mother also died of cancer and our parents met in a cancer widowers support group and got married fast. I'm 40 and have had 34 years to reflect on my life, including my father's death.\n\nPeople look at this event differently. It is without question a tragedy. He was a young man with a loving family. My childhood would have been completely different with him around. \n\nNow here comes the perspective. With a completely different childhood I would not be there person I am. I became a family lawyer because of my childhood. I accept state paid (which is far below my billable rate) child protection cases because I know what it feels like not to have a voice. If I change my life it doesn't just bring my dad back, everything changes. The good like my husband, 2 daughters, pet cats, house and the many children I have helped may never have happened. Certainly the love I have for my stepfather and 3 step sisters disappears. Your mum chooses to focus on the good parts of life - primarily how great her life is now. She's not trivializing the trauma of death, it's just not the event she chooses to focus on. That is her right. She may make the decision that because she likes the life she has she wouldn't change the past, even the terrible bits. She is also entitled to say that and I honestly think you need to accept those are her feelings without telling her she needs to not express them because they aren't yours. I'd say the same thing if you made a statement at your wedding wishing your father was alive and she confronted you because she felt it invalidated the family you have. Sometimes they way other ppl view our shared tragedies hurts because it's not how we view them. It is not reasonable to ask them to repress their feelings. If she'd stood up and said I'm glad my former husband died I'd say that was insensitive and she should not have said it. That's not what she said, not wanting to change a trauma is not the same as being glad a trauma happened. A polite request that in the future she only speak for herself was all this situation needed. Your brother accusing her of being glad your father died was more f'd up than anything she said.\n\nHaving 4 sisters with deceased parents and a mum and step dad who are both widowers has really opened my eyes to every perspective on this kind of tragedy. Ultimately - as I tell my own children - you cannot change the past. It's the past. How you view it is all that you can own and no one has the right to dictate that to you. I have a friend whose father passed as a child who was then assaulted by multiple men throughout his childhood. His story is the worst case of child abuse I have ever heard and I work in the industry. I have heard him make many speeches similar to your mum's. I don't know how he can not want to change his past but he honestly doesn't. We don't always understand others processes but we respect them. Asking for respect from your mum by not speaking on your behalf is reasonable, telling her that feeling the way she does is equivalent to being glad your father died is not.", "Sorry but I think YTA. Slightly.\n\nI think you\u2019re taking her speech far too literally. I would of took it as after her husband died she wouldn\u2019t change a thing of what had happened, by meeting her new husband and stepchildren. \nYou\u2019re also taking it far too personally. The speech was not about you or your siblings. It was directed to your step family on one of their special days.\n\nYou really think she wouldn\u2019t change her husband, father of her children dying? All the grief she would have felt?\n\nI feel there\u2019s underlying bitterness and unexpressed grief from losing your father and your mother moving on.\n\nI feel for you all.", "NAH\n\nI dont think being grateful for the family she has now means that she is glad that your father died. I also would ask was your fathers death accidental? Natural? Traumatic? I only ask because my fathers death was unavoidable and sudden, there was nothing my family could do to change it. In my mind when she says \"I wouldn't change anything\" it means anything within her control. Almost like appreciating what you have because you know you can never change it. I understand your frustration and the way you took it. But from the bottom of my heart, sometimes it's just not that serious or like that. I think you and your siblings have some therapy to go to if your immediate response was, believing that your mother was somehow happy or content with your father dying. But of course you deal with your grief however you see it, I just hate to see grief tear a family apart.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And then a couple years later, we met. He has described us as the \"most functional, happy, and healthy relationship he's ever had\". He also spends a lot more time with his family, as opposed to when he was with the ex wife, who actively tried to keep them apart (he didn't even know his niblings names until leaving her). He will be the first person to tell you, his dad's death ultimately changed his life for the better. \n\nOut of context, it sounds absolutely horrible. But no one is saying it's a good thing he passed, or that they're glad he did, just that his passing set a lot of things in motion. \n\nSo yes, it is extremely sad that you lost your dad. Presumably it's sad that she lost her husband.  But from that, she gained more family, she found she was able to love again, she was able to be happy again.\n\nThere are NAH. \n\nI'm not going to say you're wrong for being hurt, but she didn't say anything about your dad.

Doesn\u2019t mean they would choose to relive it, but since it is what it is, you find the silver lining. It\u2019s bizarre that people are pretending she said \u201cglad you\u2019re dad died\u201d.", "both things can be true at the same time! your mom can be appreciative of the life and relationships she has, and she can also love and miss your dad and wish he was still here. those two things don\u2019t cancel each other out. it\u2019s just that one was appropriate to say given the occasion.", "Aww OP, she probably did wish he was still around and then she moved on to a new relationship and you can't be in a new relationship wishing and pining over someone who cannot come back to this world. You are lucky bc, I assume, you have not lost someone you love - the dynamics are complex. When my fiance died, I was sad for years. But I found someone new I love, and while I still love my ex and wish he was still here because death sucks, I do love and I am thankful for my current relationship. I'm happier now because I'm older and have more experience and can do more now that I could then but that doesn't discount the happiness I felt back then. You and your siblings are dealing with a different type of pain from your mom and your perspectives are different. Of course you want your dad around, and that will never go away. Losing a lover vs losing a parent is very different thats why I can't say your mom is wrong for feeling how she feels.", "INFO:  How old were all of you when your dad died?", "absolutely agreed. getting the vibe here that lots of people haven\u2019t experienced this sort of tragedy / trauma and recovery.", "We were 8, 10 and 11 when he died.", "Thank you.  I'm very sorry your mom's speech was so bad.  It must have been excruciatingly painful to sit through.  It's very impressive and nice that you and your siblings stayed polite and respectful while at your stepbrother's wedding.
