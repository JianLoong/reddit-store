Mom delivered a very long and heartfelt speech about how glad she was to be in his life, how she was so glad life worked out the way it had and that she wouldn't change the events of her life because they were worth it to get these moments of perfection and how we as a family were all so grateful and glad our lives had turned out as they had. She was crying, her husband was crying and stepbrother and his wife were crying. But my brother, sister and I felt her words like a slap in the face. To get this \"perfect family\" we had to lose our dad suddenly, and it also meant being torn away from the place we felt most at home because mom couldn't stand being there and took us away from family and friends. To hear her say she was glad everything happened, glad dad died... my siblings and I could not shake that. Mom was glowing and gushing the whole rest of the wedding and the next day she was upset that we didn't go to hang out with her and her husband. She asked us what happened and why we'd acted like we were caught between crying and getting mad most of the wedding. My brother told her that her little speech was fucked and how she was so glad dad was dead, maybe we didn't want to spend any time with her. She was all flustered and tried to say we were overreacting and taking it the worst way instead of the best way which is how she meant it.\n\nWhat followed was a couple of weeks of no talking. Then she found out the three of us were talking to each other about it and she got mad at us and said we had no right to try and make her feel guilty for her speech. I told her that she should not have spoken for us as a family and did she really think we agreed that the family was perfect? Did she really believe her three children who lost their dad, their only dad, would say they wouldn't change a thing? She told me we don't only have one father. That we have two and were blessed with a bigger family out of a loss. I told her it didn't take from the fact we would change that in a heartbeat and we would keep our dad regardless of whether her husband and his son came into our lives or not. I told her she had to see how it would hurt us to hear those words. I brought up that nobody else made a speech like it. And how we had to try and act okay through it all to not cause a scene while we had our hearts ripped out. She said yet again how we saw the worst in it and how she was speaking for herself. I told her no, she spoke about the whole family feeling that way and she had no right to do that.\n\nShe told me I had no right to speak to her the way I was and that I was just trying to make her words bad instead of good. She told the three of us that we were being spiteful and taking our grief about dad out on her and she wasn't going to tolerate it.\n\nHer husband and our stepbrother learned about the argument and they're annoyed at us for being upset also.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671813066, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztljk5/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_had_no_right_to_speak/", "score": 1213, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m sorry you lost your dad. I\u2019m glad you have your siblings for support. \n\nIt almost sounds like your mom feels guilty for finding love again. There were a billion ways she could have expressed how much she loves her step kid without disrespecting you guys.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYour mother, unfortunately, shows a remarkable lack of empathy toward you and your siblings. It sounds like she might be a narcissist, focusing only on her own feelings. She appears completely blind to the hurt and loss you've suffered from losing your dad.\n\nI hope she manages to see your point of view some day. But with her husband and stepson enabling her and taking her side, it seems unlikely.\n\nIt's great that the three of you have each other. I wish you happiness in the future.", "NTA \n\nYou have a right to express your hurt feelings. Her words were tactless and definitely shows that she is a self centered person with little or no empathy for anyone but having said that to have no empathy for the hurt caused by her words and not apologising is really really indicative that there is Zero self reflection\u2026.\n\nGlad you and your siblings have each other\u2019s back", "NTA\n\nShe may have been well-intentioned with her speech but the fact she doubled down once she realized how hurt you were says it all.

She owes you an apology which she is too clueless and most likely to selfish to give you all. Enjoy your relationship with your siblings, keep your mom at arms lenght.

Your mother has clearly moved on from your father's loss. She loves her new husband and stepson. She came through a terrible time of loss and gained family. She wanted to share her happiness about this. That's all understandable. BUT she clearly did not consider you and your siblings' feelings. She was not purposely cruel, but she was  thoughtless. You and your siblings' feelings are valid and your pain is real. She hurt you and you are right to hold her accountable for that.", "YTA. You twisted her words and applied intentions that were not there. Your father loss was out of her control.  If she could have him back she probably would in a \u2764\ufe0f beat. That's not possible. Yes.  She had choice to move on or not. She did.  She found happiness.  Her intentions were not, she is glad your father is dead. She is glad she was given a second chance.

You are married now and love your husband, but had certain things happened (good and bad) in your life, do you think you'd be with that particular person? That seems how she views things and that's fine. Who knows how her relationship with your dad and maybe the stepdad is her true love. \n\nBut it's also ok for you to be upset that she said \"we are grateful\" instead of \"I am\". But it seems like even if she said during the speech that it was only her feelings, you and your siblings would still feel slighted.", "May I offer a perspective. For background my father died of cancer when my sister and I were children. My stepsisters mother also died of cancer and our parents met in a cancer widowers support group and got married fast. I'm 40 and have had 34 years to reflect on my life, including my father's death.\n\nPeople look at this event differently. It is without question a tragedy. He was a young man with a loving family. My childhood would have been completely different with him around. \n\nNow here comes the perspective. With a completely different childhood I would not be there person I am. I became a family lawyer because of my childhood. I accept state paid (which is far below my billable rate) child protection cases because I know what it feels like not to have a voice. If I change my life it doesn't just bring my dad back, everything changes. The good like my husband, 2 daughters, pet cats, house and the many children I have helped may never have happened. Certainly the love I have for my stepfather and 3 step sisters disappears. Your mum chooses to focus on the good parts of life - primarily how great her life is now. She's not trivializing the trauma of death, it's just not the event she chooses to focus on. That is her right. She may make the decision that because she likes the life she has she wouldn't change the past, even the terrible bits. She is also entitled to say that and I honestly think you need to accept those are her feelings without telling her she needs to not express them because they aren't yours. I'd say the same thing if you made a statement at your wedding wishing your father was alive and she confronted you because she felt it invalidated the family you have. Sometimes they way other ppl view our shared tragedies hurts because it's not how we view them. It is not reasonable to ask them to repress their feelings. If she'd stood up and said I'm glad my former husband died I'd say that was insensitive and she should not have said it. That's not what she said, not wanting to change a trauma is not the same as being glad a trauma happened. A polite request that in the future she only speak for herself was all this situation needed. Your brother accusing her of being glad your father died was more f'd up than anything she said.\n\nHaving 4 sisters with deceased parents and a mum and step dad who are both widowers has really opened my eyes to every perspective on this kind of tragedy. Ultimately - as I tell my own children - you cannot change the past. It's the past. How you view it is all that you can own and no one has the right to dictate that to you. I have a friend whose father passed as a child who was then assaulted by multiple men throughout his childhood. His story is the worst case of child abuse I have ever heard and I work in the industry. I have heard him make many speeches similar to your mum's. I don't know how he can not want to change his past but he honestly doesn't. We don't always understand others processes but we respect them. Asking for respect from your mum by not speaking on your behalf is reasonable, telling her that feeling the way she does is equivalent to being glad your father died is not.", "Sorry but I think YTA. Slightly.\n\nI think you\u2019re taking her speech far too literally. I would of took it as after her husband died she wouldn\u2019t change a thing of what had happened, by meeting her new husband and stepchildren. \nYou\u2019re also taking it far too personally. The speech was not about you or your siblings. It was directed to your step family on one of their special days.\n\nYou really think she wouldn\u2019t change her husband, father of her children dying? All the grief she would have felt?\n\nI feel there\u2019s underlying bitterness and unexpressed grief from losing your father and your mother moving on.\n\nI feel for you all.", "NAH\n\nI dont think being grateful for the family she has now means that she is glad that your father died. I also would ask was your fathers death accidental? Natural? Traumatic? I only ask because my fathers death was unavoidable and sudden, there was nothing my family could do to change it. In my mind when she says \"I wouldn't change anything\" it means anything within her control. Almost like appreciating what you have because you know you can never change it. I understand your frustration and the way you took it. But from the bottom of my heart, sometimes it's just not that serious or like that. I think you and your siblings have some therapy to go to if your immediate response was, believing that your mother was somehow happy or content with your father dying. But of course you deal with your grief however you see it, I just hate to see grief tear a family apart.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And then a couple years later, we met. He has described us as the \"most functional, happy, and healthy relationship he's ever had\". He also spends a lot more time with his family, as opposed to when he was with the ex wife, who actively tried to keep them apart (he didn't even know his niblings names until leaving her). He will be the first person to tell you, his dad's death ultimately changed his life for the better. \n\nOut of context, it sounds absolutely horrible.

Doesn\u2019t mean they would choose to relive it, but since it is what it is, you find the silver lining.

You are lucky bc, I assume, you have not lost someone you love - the dynamics are complex. When my fiance died, I was sad for years. But I found someone new I love, and while I still love my ex and wish he was still here because death sucks, I do love and I am thankful for my current relationship. I'm happier now because I'm older and have more experience and can do more now that I could then but that doesn't discount the happiness I felt back then. You and your siblings are dealing with a different type of pain from your mom and your perspectives are different. Of course you want your dad around, and that will never go away. Losing a lover vs losing a parent is very different thats why I can't say your mom is wrong for feeling how she feels.", "INFO:  How old were all of you when your dad died?", "absolutely agreed. getting the vibe here that lots of people haven\u2019t experienced this sort of tragedy / trauma and recovery.", "We were 8, 10 and 11 when he died.", "Thank you.

She was talking about being happy for what she had, you took it as she was happy for what she lost.", "NAH  simply because given your ages when your father passed, there may be some things you don\u2019t know about.  Things which could explain her double down and focus on her perspective of the positives while still working to keep that information from you to preserve your memories of your father.", "NTA.  \nYour mother has done gone lost her motherf*cking mind. \nJust because she's blocked it from her mind doesn't mean any of you had. I'd be pissed, too.", "Wow, your mom isn't so nice. What a horrible thing to say & diminish the life of your father.  You and your siblings aren't TA, but your mother and step family are.", "soft YTA\n\nI know that this is going against the tide and people can hate on this all they want, but the simple fact is you didn\u2019t just lose a father, she lost a husband. She grieved for him too. Finding your stepfather and stepbrother probably made her feel like they were the light at the end of the tunnel. Like she had to go through all that stuff, but know there\u2019s something too make her feel like there was a reason behind it. Honestly, a lot of people view loss like this. Because how else should they view it? This probably makes her feel like there was a reason for losing her husband. Because remember, before he was YOUR dad, he was HER husband.", "NTA.  Your mother probably meant that your stepbrother is a silver lining, the rainbow after the storm and a breath of fresh air after the hell that  was the grief of losing your father.  She did not adequately express that sentiment though.  She can be glad to have your stepbrother in her life without being glad for what it took to make that happen.", "NTA. If she didn't want your opinion she shouldn't have asked for it. Upon finding out how much her speech hurt you guys  she doubled down on trying to get you guys to go with her narrative. Completely disregarding all of your feelings. Then tried to make herself the victim.", "NTA", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and that she moved you away from your friends and family so suddenly.

I probably would\u2019ve went with N A H and chalked it up to her misspeaking if she had just apologized and explained to OP and their siblings that she did not mean it that way. But OP and siblings explained how they felt, and their mother got defensive over it. OP is NTA.", "bingo.", "It\u2019s a tough though because the half siblings would literally not exist. \n\nAre they suppose to wish themselves dead? It gets really complicated\n\nI think sometimes to for someone who lost a spouse and then gets other kids it\u2019s just well my lost gave me kids", "What makes her the AH is instead of accepting their feelings she keeps trying to change them and make them feel blessed where they don't.", "Also it\u2019s just a wedding speech. She was probably nervous about speaking in front of people and emotional from the wedding. If she doesn\u2019t say this stuff routinely, I don\u2019t get why it\u2019s a big deal. This is a one time event. You talked about it. Why blow up your relationship. You\u2019re always going to miss your father but you can\u2019t let yourself get stuck there.", "I'm not sure why you've decided to interpret that as \"I'm glad dad died\". People pick themselves up and make room for new relationships after suffering loss. She's allowed to love her stepson at his wedding and let him know she's happy to have him in her family. That thought can coexist with her immense grief. I would go as far as saying you have no way of knowing how deep her grief goes and what she went through as a widow and mom of 3. \n\nIt's ok for you to have an initial reaction to her speech but it's not ok to double down and assign the worst possible meaning to it. You're not defending your dad from an attack, you're not honouring your grief, you're just blowing up your remaining parental relationship for no good reason.

I don't care if she meant no disrespect.", "NTA but your mother certainly is.", "NTA, I'm petty so take this for what you will. \nIf the speech was filmed, I would take that segment and overlay it with words to express how each part made me feel and then post it. \nI'm a petty, petty b*tch when it comes to things like this though. \n\nI'm so sorry for you and your siblings OP. I can't even imagine what it was like to sit through that.", "NTA", "NTA.  You have every right to your feelings. Your mother's speech was thoughtless, and you deserve an apology.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s a evil asshole to even think that was remotely acceptable", "NTA that's so sad. I'm so sorry you and your siblings had to endure that <3", "NTA.  I'm sorry for your loss and I'm sorry you and your brothers had to live through a moment like that.", "You're definitely NTA. I'm really sorry for your loss. I lost my dad when I was 7. It's been 23 years. It's a pain that is unlike anything I've ever experienced. I hope your mom sees the error in her ways.", "See, I read this post and starting off I was thinking along the lines of \"she worded it wrong, but she's not an asshole.\" The second half really threw me for a loop. She basically justified and confirmed that she is happy that this loss happened? I would understand if she was meaning to say, \"hey, we've all gotten through this together, and come to a place of happiness once again,\" but she's almost glad that it happened (from what's being said in this post), which is absolutely horrible. \n\nYOU also had EVERY RIGHT to express your feelings towards this situation, and she should've known she was wrong. \n\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA", "Too bad for her new family. They are extremely insensitive. NTA", "NTA at all.\n\nI know if it were my dad that died and my mom said it was a \u201cblessing\u201d this would be my response:\n\n\u201cI was already mourning dad. Of course I\u2019m even sadder now because I have to mourn the loss of my mom, because anyone who can call my father\u2019s death a blessing is dead to me.\u201d", "NTA. It's the double down for me. Instead of taking into account that you and your siblings had a different emotional reaction to hers, she just told you that you're wrong for having feelings. \n\nThis is gonna get a bit too into my own trauma but I lost my mom when I was very young and for a long time I would think about how different (and better) my life would've been if she'd survived, and if it'd been my dad instead her. As I grew, and came into my own, I stopped thinking that way. The past can't be changed, but that doesn't mean we need to crap on the memories of others. Everyone has different experiences regarding the loss of people they love. \n\nEven back then, I never would have thought about saying such things to my dad, even when he was a total AH and I resented being in his presence. It would've hurt both of us more than it would've helped me vent. In this case, your mom entirely moved on and assumed you and your sibs felt the same. And she was wrong. \n\nI'm sorry for the loss of your dad, and for your mom's lack of regard for her own children's feelings.", "NAH\n\ni know you don\u2019t want to hear this but you are taking what she is saying and twisting it. She is definitely not happy your father died. Shes happy that out of that lost she was able to grow her/your family and found a loving man and step son out of it.\n\nYou and your siblings are valid in your emotions of missing your dad, and you do not have to view your step father as your father.\n\nYou and your siblings need therapy because it is not okay for the three of you to be crucifying her for a heartfelt speech she gave at your step brothers wedding.\n\nGrief is hard, a blended family is hard as well. She moved forward with her life and is grateful for the family she found and grew.\n\nDo you and your siblings have unresolved issues with your step father and step brother cause it sure sounds like you guys just tolerate them?", "YTA. It's not about you or your dad. Your mum was saying how glad she was that your stepbrother was in her life, and wanted to celebrate that at his wedding. On some level you know that.\n\nHowever I understand why you are angry. I understand that her speech must have felt like diminishing your dad and everything you went through, because that will probably always feel raw. However you know your mum, and you know honestly know whether she meant it like that. \n\nIt is fine to tell her that she upset you and why. Do you think that she really intended to dismiss your dad? To be honest I don't think you are an AH, but do you really want to not have a relationship with your mum, or do you just want her to know that you are upset with how what she said affected you? You have written that she has said that it wasn't meant in the way it came across to you, what could she actually do to make that clearer or to make it up to you- have you told her what you need?\n\nLife is short and people make mistakes. If you think she really intended to dismiss your dad then fair enough, but if you think it was just clumsy wording then that might be forgiveable. I am sure you have had (and will have) your own moments where you put your foot in it, how would you like to come to an understanding with others in those moments?", "\"Emotional orphans.\" Very well said. OP is NTA.", "Bingo. And I find it key that her annoyance is more that they were talking about her than what their hurt was", "That\u2019s my thought. They kept it classy", "She could've said \"I'm glad we got something good outside of our terrible circumstances\" instead of \"I'm glad things (including OP's dad's death) turned out this way\"\n\nThe former doesn't invalidate anyone's feelings or make it seem you're happy that someone died", "It's not that he is upset that she moved on.  It's that she gave a very public speech giving thanks for all the events in her life.  These events, \"overcoming the death of her first husband\" just happen to be OP and siblings father. \n\nTo Mom, husbands death was an obstacle she overcame.  To kids-- OP and siblings, it's the opposite.  Their father cannot be replaced. Their father won't walk them down the aisle or be there to help around the house etc. It's heartbreaking. How many remarriage stepparent horror stories need to be told to get where they are coming from? It was a insensitive AH move and she owes them an apology.", "They acted respectfully at the wedding, didn\u2019t raise the issue. They then made their feelings known after the fact, feelings they are entitled to. She is completely insensitive to their valid issues and refuses to acknowledge the problem she created.", "When you say to someone, \"your words hurt me\" and they say, \"no, you're wrong\" that's a huge AH flag.", "I once had an argument with my adoptive mother. She said a bunch of critical stuff. I was angry and replied \"yeah? Your father didn't die.\" Eventually I went NC.", "Sometimes it's best to just keep quiet and not think about it. We don't have to voice all our thoughts and feelings, especially not ones we know would harm someone.", "Divorce also could have been a possibility that would keep the sibling's existence possible. No need to tell your child that you're happy that their parent died. Keep that shit to your friends and coworkers if you want to stay on good terms with your kids.\n\n\nIf you want to express it to them, just keep it to saying that you're happy that you got the chance to get to know them, and that you love being their family. There's no need to bring up a dead parent to say that you love your (new) family.", "NAH. I can absolutely see how it stung, and how it erased your experience of it. But what she's describing is a kind of acceptance that makes me think she may have gone to grief counseling, even, to make peace with this. It's certainly not an uncommon way for people to process grief and come to terms with a devastating loss in their own way. She hasn't handled this well, and you have every right to be mad, but I can also see why she handled it badly when she felt defensive about a really foundational part of healing she's also had to do AND being a mother. Nobody has done a good job here of acknowledging that every single one of you has had to process this loss in your own way, make peace in your own way, and has your own truth. She told you what your feelings should be and didn't listen to what you were telling her, but you are also telling her what she said, what she meant by it, and what she's supposed to feel. This is an extraordinarily difficult situation to navigate and it's raw as hell. I don't think anyone is at fault for failing to do a great job or expressing things well.", "True! I think it\u2019s not an easy thing when you lose someone and move forward", "I do agree with that! But it\u2019s hard. I think it\u2019s best when thinking of deceased loves ones as they are dead nothing can be changed", "Nowhere does anyone suggest they want her to say the ludicrous things you wrote out. She could of handled it a number of ways respectfully of both old and new family.", "Yeah, that stood out too. Even if the siblings were somehow in the wrong, talking about this and processing is healthy. \n\nI hope the OP and their siblings can continue to support each other.", "No one is talking about being glad he died or anything of the sort. A beautiful family relationship happened after a loss and that's just what it is. \n\nAnd even if OP and their siblings despise their stepbrother and can't even look at him without being angry and reminded that he only exists as part of their lives because their dad died, there still isn't any reason to get this upset over polite platitudes in a wedding speech. It's just a little speech to make the dude feel loved. Average people aren't eloquent and don't have speech writers and focus groups to test each line and evaluate the risk of someone taking it the wrong way. \n\nKids who lose their parent(s) still have their whole lives ahead despite the sadness. Meanwhile wen who lose their spouse and coparent are supposed to stop living and stay loyal to a dead spouse for life, never to enjoy another moment? The misogyny runs deep. And Redditors gleefully cheering OP on to destroy their relationship with their mother are the true AH of this story.", "I think one of the biggest problems is that she also spoke for her kids.\n\n\n\nHer kids understand that none of this would have happened if their dad didn't die. Of course they're going to be upset at the thought of someone publicly announcing that they wouldn't wish otherwise. She's thinking about her happiness within her new marriage, but the kids are still grieving the loss of their only bio dad. I mean, she has remarried. They can't just pick a new biodad in the same way.\n\n\n\nThe road to hell is paved with good intentions. If I accidentally (heavily) implied that someone was happy that their parent died, I would be mortified and apologize. I sure as hell wouldn't tell them that they were wrong to be upset at me.\n\n\n\nGrief is a reason, but it's not an excuse to ignore someone when they tell you that you have hurt them. You can grieve a loved one and still accidentally choose actions that are A-holish. They aren't mutually exclusive. OP can't just get another bio dad.\n\n\n\nDoubling down and telling OP that their feelings are wrong is what did it for me.  Everyone messes up sometimes, it's just part of being human. The turning point is how you handle it afterwards. Is her ego relating to her words more important than her loved one's feelings? \n\n\n\nIMO, she should have either only spoke for herself, or stuck to something along the lines of \"We're happy to have you in our lives, and we love you so much! We are honored to be included in such a big milestone and we're excited to spend many more years with you!\".", "Yeah, by saying \u201cmoments like this make everything bad we had to go through worth it\u201d which is essentially what she said.", "NAH. \n\nYou are too wrapped up in your own trauma to have grace for a heartfelt sentiment delivered a little clunky. She doesn\u2019t like that your dad died. Cmon now. She was expressing that he life was enriched with how things turned out after tragedy. \n\nYou can be hurt. Your feelings are your feelings. But you\u2019re missing the message and creating drama when it doesn\u2019t need to be so.", "NAH, but bordering on Y T A. Her speech was written to express love and appreciation to her stepson on his wedding day. I understand feeling slightly slighted by some of the wording in the speech, but you've completely taken it out of context and begun putting words in your mother's mouth. She has every reason to be offended by your accusations.", "NTA.\n\nI can understand to some extant that she got all emotional and kind of carried away during your stepbrothers wedding. \n\nBut you and your siblings also are allowed to feel the way you feel and her simply neglecting it and even doubling down on it, makes her the AH.", "NTA. You have the right to your feelings and to tell your mom not to talk on behalf of your whole family on this. Reading this from her perspective, my guess is that she might not have been as happy with your dad in that marriage as she is with her current husband. \n\nMy mother shared later in life that after my dad passed she realized (years later) that things were not always great and if he had lived they might not have stayed married long term. This was obviously hard to hear, but as an adult I expect and appreciate that her experience was as a wife and is valid. Just like mine was a child and is not the same. My mother would never dream to give a talk like this though and assume we would agree. She\u2019s conscious of making sure our public memories of him are always super positive.  Particularly in public.", "Ya its one thing for her to say she is glad she met husband and stepson and are a part of their lives and that can be chalked up to misinterpretation but she kept on doubling down.\n\nAlso claiming implying that stepdad is a replacement for OP's dead father is about 10 steps too far.\n\nNTA", "Nta I would be pissed you have every right to be upset personally if she\u2019s not willing to apologize, I would not talk to her until she does and if your stepfather and your stepbrother want to give you shit for it I\u2019d ignore them to let them know that this wasn\u2019t the best thing that happened to you guys and it was the worst because you guys had to lose your father. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NTA", "NTA, and I think you and your siblings are really decent for going through the whole wedding and trying not to make a fuss about it. I\u2019m so sorry your mother put you in this situation, and has stayed so defensive that she can\u2019t acknowledge that her words were hurtful to you.", "NTA the three of you enjoy Christmas together while the rest of the \u201cfamily\u201d do whatever it is they want to do.", "NTA", "Nta", "Nta \n\nShe is really tone deaf about the death of her own children\u2019s father and even if your step-dad is awesome it doesn\u2019t change the huge loss. I\u2019m so sorry. The lack of empathy is staggering. How did nobody tell her before this happened? I couldn\u2019t imagine anyone who knows the whole story thinking that was a good idea.", "NTA - I support you - she was insensitive, selfish and continues to be.  Hang in there - give my best to your siblings and set up healthy boundaries to protect yourselves from her\u2026", "YTA.  Sorry your dad passed, but would you rather your mom spend the rest of her life alone and sad?  That\u2019s selfish.  Of course she\u2019s happy that she was able to find happiness again.  That\u2019s a blessing.  You should be happy that your mom is happy.  She gave a loving speech at the wedding of your stepbrother and everyone but you and your siblings thought that  it was wonderful.  She didn\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m glad my first husband died so I could have this better family\u201d.  She said she was glad she was able to find such a loving family for herself and you and your siblings.  Be glad for happy blessings.", "NTA. Sooner or later when none of her biological kids are on speaking terms with her she will eventually come round to the idea that her picture perfect family is not really her family. She can play house with her stepson's family. \n\nHer speech was horrible, disrespectful and she made it worse by not apologising when confronted. \n\nGenerally, one should not speak for others. Chances are the other person really does not feel like you do.", "Even then I think I'd lean towards nta.  You never fully get over the loss of a parent and if she wanted to speak for her kids she needed to run it by them.\n\nIf she had said she herself felt that way - I get why the kids would feel hurt but at least she's not putting words in their mouth.\n\nI also do understand you don't necessarily want to mention your late husband in that scenario depending on how many guests know - again circling back to \"so maybe she should have kept it to her personal feelings\".", "Wow that sucks. Your mother was/is way out of line.", "First - I understand why she may not want to mention her late husband, as she may not know how many guests are aware and isn't trying to usurp the wedding and make it about her grief.  So I understand why she may have had some foot in mouth with her speech.\n\nThat said - yeah.... yeah.  That's tough. I fully understand why you're all hurt by that.  \n\nShe also should not have put words in your mouths. Period. If she wanted to speak for you she needed to ask you first. \n\nAnd then her reactio. Afterwards has been particularly egregious.", "I don\u2019t know if that would have been better given the context of the speech\u2026 It would be a little awkward to bring up the death of her late husband during a speech meant to celebrate their family at her step son\u2019s wedding ceremony. She shouldn\u2019t need to acknowledge every agonizing twist and turn in her life that lead her to where she is during a speech which isn\u2019t even about her to start with. Maybe she could have simply said she is grateful to have her stepson in her life, and she is glad that they have been able to come together as a family, then left it at that without mentioning \u201cnot changing a thing.\u201d That and how she handled the later confrontation with her kids are the only parts I find AHish. At the end of the day, we do still need to keep in mind the context of this speech is her stepson\u2019s wedding and he should have been the main focus of her comments even if she could have been more tactful/mindful about her kids listening.\n\nEdit: forgot a word", "No", "Yeah that would've been fine. Idm her saying how happy she is to have her step son in her life and what not, but that part of her speech was just so unnecessary and anyone with half a brain cell would understand why it'd be problematic", "YTA. You already said you knew what she meant but instead have focused on the wording. What are you lawyers?  So she expressed herself poorly, you understood. You\u2019re just being an AH.", "YTA, way to take a kind and heartfelt speech personally in all the wrong ways. It takes a special kind of selfishness to decide that any happiness your mom was able to find after you lost your father as a 'slap in the face'.\n\nYou're entitled to whatever feelings you have, and if moving away was a hardship, but I truly hope you and your siblings are in therapy so you can stop punishing your mother for having a life after your dad's death, and God forbid, finding happiness.", "NTA - if she can\u2018t see your point or understand your feelings you know where her priorities are these days", "NTA", "NTA your mother was fucked up for saying that.. she could've just taken about her feelings and kept the rest of you out of it", "NTA, that speech sounds horrendous, I'm so sorry you and your siblings had to endure it. A speech at a wedding isn't a thoughtless endeavor, she needed to plan and prepare that speech and having zero recognition of how cruel it really was says a lot about her character. Those are her genuine feelings, and that's fine to a degree, she's happy with the way her life progressed and it was perhaps a big part of her overcoming grief. That doesn't make it appropriate or any less cruel to use in a wedding speech in front of her children who also have their OWN grief about the same situation.", "NTA\n \nOn top of everything a bunch of other commenters have said, her insensitivity extends to the stepbrother too. \n \nFor your mom and stepdad to get married, whatever type of relationship stepdad had with stepbrother\u2019s mom has to have ended. Which usually includes a lot of pain and hard times for the kid. \n \nSo she\u2019s up there in front of family and friends, many of whom probably know/knew his mother, his mother may actually *be* there, and she\u2019s like \u201cI\u2019m so glad that relationship crashed and burned and your biological parents split up so I could marry your dad.\u201d \n \nWhich is totally effed up, on *top* of what she said that hurt you and your bio siblings. \n \nSome commenters are saying the speech and the moment was about the step brother and she was so focused on him that she wasn\u2019t thinking. \n \nTo me this reads as her being focused on *her* involvement, *her* place in the family and stepbrother\u2019s life, and *her* moment to shine as one big happy family in front of a crowd. \n \nIf your stepbrother wasn\u2019t also squicked out by the speech then your mom is lucky, because I think that was highly inappropriate for *everyone.* And she owes everyone an apology.", "Nta", "NTA!  Your mom is basically saying not only would she not change the way your father/her husband died but she is showing a delusion of a perfect family unit. Her husband and your step brother seem to share in that. \nYou also, didn't go Jerry Springer on them mid speech and waited until the next day to say anything", "NTA, maybe it\u2019s time for you and siblings to take a break from mom. If she hadn\u2019t doubled down, or brought the new family in, I might think NAH but wow.", "NTA. Guaranteed that your mother never acknowledges when she causes harm.

She was a corneal donor.  We were sent notice that both transplant recipients had successful surgeries.  Our lives changed.  We have freedom to do a million things that would not have been possible with her here.  We donated her hearing aids, her glasses, her wheelchair, and so much other equipment including an $11,000 specialty bed.  Her sisters have grown up   being more social and active than our previous life allowed.  We can travel more, visit family.  The pandemic did not mean two years of isolation, homeschooling, work from home, and groceries delivered to our doorstep because of how fragile our daughter's health was.  The list of good borne of our grief goes on.\n\nNONE of it is worth it.  My husband, her sisters, and I would give it all back to have our daughter/sister if it didn't mean she was suffering.\n\nWe can honor the good without discounting how much we (and others) would never have chosen the loss.

And I'm 100% sure she handled their childhood the same beastly manner. Focusing on herself. Moving the kids away from their family and friends because it was easier for her. She should have left them with Dad's family.  At least then, they wouldn't have been stripped of their father, family and friends in one fatal blow.  If she had handled any part of their grief correctly they wouldn't be bleeding to death now.  Hey but at least she found an AH stepfather and snot nose stepbrother for them. Sounds wonderful.", "Yikes."]}
