Mom delivered a very long and heartfelt speech about how glad she was to be in his life, how she was so glad life worked out the way it had and that she wouldn't change the events of her life because they were worth it to get these moments of perfection and how we as a family were all so grateful and glad our lives had turned out as they had. She was crying, her husband was crying and stepbrother and his wife were crying. But my brother, sister and I felt her words like a slap in the face. To get this \"perfect family\" we had to lose our dad suddenly, and it also meant being torn away from the place we felt most at home because mom couldn't stand being there and took us away from family and friends. To hear her say she was glad everything happened, glad dad died... my siblings and I could not shake that. Mom was glowing and gushing the whole rest of the wedding and the next day she was upset that we didn't go to hang out with her and her husband. She asked us what happened and why we'd acted like we were caught between crying and getting mad most of the wedding. My brother told her that her little speech was fucked and how she was so glad dad was dead, maybe we didn't want to spend any time with her. She was all flustered and tried to say we were overreacting and taking it the worst way instead of the best way which is how she meant it.\n\nWhat followed was a couple of weeks of no talking. Then she found out the three of us were talking to each other about it and she got mad at us and said we had no right to try and make her feel guilty for her speech. I told her that she should not have spoken for us as a family and did she really think we agreed that the family was perfect? Did she really believe her three children who lost their dad, their only dad, would say they wouldn't change a thing? She told me we don't only have one father. That we have two and were blessed with a bigger family out of a loss. I told her it didn't take from the fact we would change that in a heartbeat and we would keep our dad regardless of whether her husband and his son came into our lives or not. I told her she had to see how it would hurt us to hear those words. I brought up that nobody else made a speech like it. And how we had to try and act okay through it all to not cause a scene while we had our hearts ripped out. She said yet again how we saw the worst in it and how she was speaking for herself. I told her no, she spoke about the whole family feeling that way and she had no right to do that.\n\nShe told me I had no right to speak to her the way I was and that I was just trying to make her words bad instead of good. She told the three of us that we were being spiteful and taking our grief about dad out on her and she wasn't going to tolerate it.\n\nHer husband and our stepbrother learned about the argument and they're annoyed at us for being upset also.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671813066, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztljk5/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_had_no_right_to_speak/", "score": 278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m sorry you lost your dad. I\u2019m glad you have your siblings for support. \n\nIt almost sounds like your mom feels guilty for finding love again. There were a billion ways she could have expressed how much she loves her step kid without disrespecting you guys.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYour mother, unfortunately, shows a remarkable lack of empathy toward you and your siblings. It sounds like she might be a narcissist, focusing only on her own feelings. She appears completely blind to the hurt and loss you've suffered from losing your dad.\n\nI hope she manages to see your point of view some day. But with her husband and stepson enabling her and taking her side, it seems unlikely.\n\nIt's great that the three of you have each other. I wish you happiness in the future.", "NTA \n\nYou have a right to express your hurt feelings. Her words were tactless and definitely shows that she is a self centered person with little or no empathy for anyone but having said that to have no empathy for the hurt caused by her words and not apologising is really really indicative that there is Zero self reflection\u2026.\n\nGlad you and your siblings have each other\u2019s back", "NTA\n\nShe may have been well-intentioned with her speech but the fact she doubled down once she realized how hurt you were says it all.

She owes you an apology which she is too clueless and most likely to selfish to give you all. Enjoy your relationship with your siblings, keep your mom at arms lenght.

Your mother has clearly moved on from your father's loss. She loves her new husband and stepson. She came through a terrible time of loss and gained family. She wanted to share her happiness about this. That's all understandable. BUT she clearly did not consider you and your siblings' feelings. She was not purposely cruel, but she was  thoughtless. You and your siblings' feelings are valid and your pain is real. She hurt you and you are right to hold her accountable for that.", "YTA. You twisted her words and applied intentions that were not there. Your father loss was out of her control.  If she could have him back she probably would in a \u2764\ufe0f beat. That's not possible. Yes.  She had choice to move on or not. She did.  She found happiness.  Her intentions were not, she is glad your father is dead. She is glad she was given a second chance.

Your  twisting and turning a a knife, you feel she deserves to have plunged into her soul that she dared to find a life after the loss of dreams of the family she lost.", "NAH. \nThese are things people routinely say in moments like this and adults understand that it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s glad someone died, but that despite awful things happening that good things happen too.

You are married now and love your husband, but had certain things happened (good and bad) in your life, do you think you'd be with that particular person? That seems how she views things and that's fine. Who knows how her relationship with your dad and maybe the stepdad is her true love. \n\nBut it's also ok for you to be upset that she said \"we are grateful\" instead of \"I am\". But it seems like even if she said during the speech that it was only her feelings, you and your siblings would still feel slighted.", "May I offer a perspective. For background my father died of cancer when my sister and I were children. My stepsisters mother also died of cancer and our parents met in a cancer widowers support group and got married fast. I'm 40 and have had 34 years to reflect on my life, including my father's death.\n\nPeople look at this event differently. It is without question a tragedy. He was a young man with a loving family. My childhood would have been completely different with him around. \n\nNow here comes the perspective. With a completely different childhood I would not be there person I am. I became a family lawyer because of my childhood. I accept state paid (which is far below my billable rate) child protection cases because I know what it feels like not to have a voice. If I change my life it doesn't just bring my dad back, everything changes. The good like my husband, 2 daughters, pet cats, house and the many children I have helped may never have happened. Certainly the love I have for my stepfather and 3 step sisters disappears. Your mum chooses to focus on the good parts of life - primarily how great her life is now. She's not trivializing the trauma of death, it's just not the event she chooses to focus on. That is her right. She may make the decision that because she likes the life she has she wouldn't change the past, even the terrible bits. She is also entitled to say that and I honestly think you need to accept those are her feelings without telling her she needs to not express them because they aren't yours. I'd say the same thing if you made a statement at your wedding wishing your father was alive and she confronted you because she felt it invalidated the family you have. Sometimes they way other ppl view our shared tragedies hurts because it's not how we view them. It is not reasonable to ask them to repress their feelings. If she'd stood up and said I'm glad my former husband died I'd say that was insensitive and she should not have said it. That's not what she said, not wanting to change a trauma is not the same as being glad a trauma happened. A polite request that in the future she only speak for herself was all this situation needed. Your brother accusing her of being glad your father died was more f'd up than anything she said.\n\nHaving 4 sisters with deceased parents and a mum and step dad who are both widowers has really opened my eyes to every perspective on this kind of tragedy. Ultimately - as I tell my own children - you cannot change the past. It's the past. How you view it is all that you can own and no one has the right to dictate that to you. I have a friend whose father passed as a child who was then assaulted by multiple men throughout his childhood. His story is the worst case of child abuse I have ever heard and I work in the industry. I have heard him make many speeches similar to your mum's. I don't know how he can not want to change his past but he honestly doesn't. We don't always understand others processes but we respect them. Asking for respect from your mum by not speaking on your behalf is reasonable, telling her that feeling the way she does is equivalent to being glad your father died is not.", "Sorry but I think YTA. Slightly.\n\nI think you\u2019re taking her speech far too literally. I would of took it as after her husband died she wouldn\u2019t change a thing of what had happened, by meeting her new husband and stepchildren. \nYou\u2019re also taking it far too personally. The speech was not about you or your siblings. It was directed to your step family on one of their special days.\n\nYou really think she wouldn\u2019t change her husband, father of her children dying? All the grief she would have felt?\n\nI feel there\u2019s underlying bitterness and unexpressed grief from losing your father and your mother moving on.\n\nI feel for you all.", "NAH\n\nI dont think being grateful for the family she has now means that she is glad that your father died. I also would ask was your fathers death accidental? Natural? Traumatic? I only ask because my fathers death was unavoidable and sudden, there was nothing my family could do to change it. In my mind when she says \"I wouldn't change anything\" it means anything within her control. Almost like appreciating what you have because you know you can never change it. I understand your frustration and the way you took it. But from the bottom of my heart, sometimes it's just not that serious or like that. I think you and your siblings have some therapy to go to if your immediate response was, believing that your mother was somehow happy or content with your father dying. But of course you deal with your grief however you see it, I just hate to see grief tear a family apart.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And then a couple years later, we met. He has described us as the \"most functional, happy, and healthy relationship he's ever had\". He also spends a lot more time with his family, as opposed to when he was with the ex wife, who actively tried to keep them apart (he didn't even know his niblings names until leaving her). He will be the first person to tell you, his dad's death ultimately changed his life for the better. \n\nOut of context, it sounds absolutely horrible.

Doesn\u2019t mean they would choose to relive it, but since it is what it is, you find the silver lining.

You are lucky bc, I assume, you have not lost someone you love - the dynamics are complex. When my fiance died, I was sad for years. But I found someone new I love, and while I still love my ex and wish he was still here because death sucks, I do love and I am thankful for my current relationship. I'm happier now because I'm older and have more experience and can do more now that I could then but that doesn't discount the happiness I felt back then. You and your siblings are dealing with a different type of pain from your mom and your perspectives are different. Of course you want your dad around, and that will never go away. Losing a lover vs losing a parent is very different thats why I can't say your mom is wrong for feeling how she feels.", "INFO:  How old were all of you when your dad died?", "absolutely agreed. getting the vibe here that lots of people haven\u2019t experienced this sort of tragedy / trauma and recovery.", "We were 8, 10 and 11 when he died.", "Thank you.

She was talking about being happy for what she had, you took it as she was happy for what she lost.", "NAH  simply because given your ages when your father passed, there may be some things you don\u2019t know about.  Things which could explain her double down and focus on her perspective of the positives while still working to keep that information from you to preserve your memories of your father.", "NTA.  \nYour mother has done gone lost her motherf*cking mind. \nJust because she's blocked it from her mind doesn't mean any of you had. I'd be pissed, too.", "Wow, your mom isn't so nice. What a horrible thing to say & diminish the life of your father.  You and your siblings aren't TA, but your mother and step family are.", "soft YTA\n\nI know that this is going against the tide and people can hate on this all they want, but the simple fact is you didn\u2019t just lose a father, she lost a husband. She grieved for him too. Finding your stepfather and stepbrother probably made her feel like they were the light at the end of the tunnel. Like she had to go through all that stuff, but know there\u2019s something too make her feel like there was a reason behind it. Honestly, a lot of people view loss like this. Because how else should they view it? This probably makes her feel like there was a reason for losing her husband. Because remember, before he was YOUR dad, he was HER husband.", "NTA.  Your mother probably meant that your stepbrother is a silver lining, the rainbow after the storm and a breath of fresh air after the hell that  was the grief of losing your father.  She did not adequately express that sentiment though.  She can be glad to have your stepbrother in her life without being glad for what it took to make that happen.", "NTA. If she didn't want your opinion she shouldn't have asked for it. Upon finding out how much her speech hurt you guys  she doubled down on trying to get you guys to go with her narrative. Completely disregarding all of your feelings. Then tried to make herself the victim.", "NTA", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and that she moved you away from your friends and family so suddenly.

I probably would\u2019ve went with N A H and chalked it up to her misspeaking if she had just apologized and explained to OP and their siblings that she did not mean it that way. But OP and siblings explained how they felt, and their mother got defensive over it. OP is NTA.", "bingo.", "It\u2019s a tough though because the half siblings would literally not exist. \n\nAre they suppose to wish themselves dead? It gets really complicated\n\nI think sometimes to for someone who lost a spouse and then gets other kids it\u2019s just well my lost gave me kids", "What makes her the AH is instead of accepting their feelings she keeps trying to change them and make them feel blessed where they don't.", "Also it\u2019s just a wedding speech. She was probably nervous about speaking in front of people and emotional from the wedding. If she doesn\u2019t say this stuff routinely, I don\u2019t get why it\u2019s a big deal. This is a one time event. You talked about it. Why blow up your relationship. You\u2019re always going to miss your father but you can\u2019t let yourself get stuck there.", "I'm not sure why you've decided to interpret that as \"I'm glad dad died\". People pick themselves up and make room for new relationships after suffering loss. She's allowed to love her stepson at his wedding and let him know she's happy to have him in her family. That thought can coexist with her immense grief. I would go as far as saying you have no way of knowing how deep her grief goes and what she went through as a widow and mom of 3. \n\nIt's ok for you to have an initial reaction to her speech but it's not ok to double down and assign the worst possible meaning to it. You're not defending your dad from an attack, you're not honouring your grief, you're just blowing up your remaining parental relationship for no good reason. The solution is to accept that you're worst interpretation is not the meaning of her words, to recognize that all of you are doing and have been doing your best and to refocus that energy to build your bond instead of breaking it. Maybe you're all due for a moment to honour your dad's memory together as a family. Weddings bring out all the family drama, suffering and complicated histories. \n\nNAH, just hurt people acting emotionally, but time to dial it back down several notches.", "The thing is, she *can't* change anything.  Whether she wants to or not.  And neither can you.  To your mom, maybe it's just healthier emotionally to accept the things the she can't change?  To embrace them, because being unhappy about the events in her life won't bring loved ones back?\n\nIt may sting, but it sounds like you're just mad because she's moved on and you can't.", "You could easily say the same about OP, who is refusing to see his mother's side of things.\n\nThey're allowed to have different feelings. What's not cool is that both of them are trying to make each other feel one way because only their way is \"right.\"\n\nESH", "I don\u2019t want to say YTA because you endured what no child has to endure.   But I must say  a loss of a partner and loss of a spouse are very different things\n\nYou said your mom was so devestated when your Dad died that she had to move away. \n\nThat indicates to me that she did love your Father.  But she also has three little children and she HAD to move on. \n\nShe didn\u2019t have a choice in the matter.  \n\nShe had children to provide for. Being a single parent is tough and with three kids to boot.  It was not something she expected she had a coparent and suddenly didn\u2019t.\n\nIt must have been such a relief to her to find someone else to help with that burden.\n\nI am sure your Father and her talked about it to and she knows he would have wanted her to move forward.\n\nI think if your father had been alive your life would do be different and well who knows? Who knows if the three of you would have turned out so well who knows if her and your father would have still been happy. \n\nOn her end Wishing your father here isn\u2019t going to solve anything. He cannot come back and wishing for that would have made it impossible for her to move forward.\n\nSo I think maybe  glad is more about as much as life was hard on her she is glad for what her life is now.\n\nShe didn\u2019t have the luxury to think about  world where your Dad was still in it and when she found a new partner it would not be fair to him. She had to find a way to love both\n\nAnd having lost a partner and experienced being a single parent she may be more appreciative of the current one because she knows how fleeing things can be", "Not who you responded to, but AITA has been crazy recently with the bad takes. I actually reflect on my downvotes most of the time cause, hey, sometimes popular opinion is correct/more empathetic, and I struggle with being a jerk sometimes. Lately? I'm taking them to mean I'm actually in the right since people have been such assholes.\n\nOP is upset because his mother is grateful to have found life after the death of a spouse that caused her such grief she had to *move away* from the town in which it happened? Because he didn't like her tone or vocabulary? And people are supporting him blindly when both of them are being stubborn about the others' feelings?\n\nNah, I'll take the down votes.", "Thanks! Extremely emotional situation for all involved. Good communication and understanding needed by everyone here.", "Saying she \"wouldn't change anything\" has nothing to do with her ability, or lack there of, to change things. I can see where you're coming from but she's a completw moron to thinking wording it that way in front of her fatherless children would play out well.", "> she can't change anything\n\nI mean should could have *not* given that speech. But otherwise, yes I see your points being made. \n\nI think you may be right about the emotions but the mom was wrong in the actions.", "I definitely feel bad for OP.  It sounds like they and their siblings still feel the loss of their father pretty deeply, and that's gotta hurt.  I suppose I think about it slightly differently because my dad died when I was 6, and my life would have been DRASTICALLY different had he not died.  \n\nOf course I wish that I had a father.  But at the same time, I'd be a different person had he lived.  I'd have grown up in Pakistan instead of the US, and current \"me\" doesn't like the thought of that.  I think I'm who I'm supposed to be, and I wouldn't want to change that.  But if someone heard that and took it to mean that I'm glad my father's dead - well, they very much misinterpreted what I meant.\n\nI can't change what happened to my dad.  All I can do is be grateful for what life has given me instead.  Because what's the alternative?  To be forever miserable that I don't have a father?  Sorry, but I don't want to live life that way."]}
