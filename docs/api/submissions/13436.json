By the time we were going to head home, we were exhausted. To make our flight, we took a 4AM shuttle to the airport and could barely think/keep our eyes open. We had pretty crap seats on our first flight, they were right up against a wall or cubby at the end of the plane and not only didn't recline backward, but pushed forward a little while the people in front fully reclined into us. Needless to say, we didn't sleep, but it was a quick flight, quick layover, and we were praying for decent enough seats to get a good sleep on our final flight home, which was 6.5h.\n\nWe are in a 3 person row but the isle seat remains empty as the plane gets close to finishing boarding. We are so excited at this point, thinking we can stretch out and share the spare seat (we'd move and make the middle seat the spare and take turns lying down or stretch out a bit further and sleep back to back... I was so exhausted this was all I could imagine lol). Boarding is finished, the seat is still empty, and we are SO excited to finally get some sleep.\n\nAfter boarding a woman from a few rows down says she noticed the empty seat and asked if she can switch us (we are a bit confused), then explains that she would ask her seat neighbour to fill our empty seat so that she can have a full seat for her baby. We were visibly disappointed; I was super nauseous at this point and just wanted to sleep for a bit. We asked if we can switch seats after a couple hours because we'd been travelling for a long time and were really rung out. She said ok.\n\nShortly after we were served a snack. The woman couldn't really manage her baby, and asked a flight attendant to hold it so that she could eat. A couple minutes after this, she came over and said that's it, the man is coming to fill the empty seat, we have to move back to our assigned seats and let her have an extra for her baby. I gave her a rude look/looked away and didn't say a word more. She put her baby seat on the seat next to her, now empty, and that was that.\n\nThe baby was very loud, always whining and crying but that's nothing you can blame a baby for. She then gave the baby a rattle toy which was constantly being shaken and really loud, on top of the whining and crying. The mum also shook the rattle toy for the baby to try to get it to quiet down (didn't work) making additional noise. This wasn't once or twice but throughout most of the flight incl. during lights+windows off/sleeping time.\n\nAfter we got off the plane I complained to my friend and she said I was being an AH for acting so irritated by this woman, when she was struggling with the baby. She said I should have been kinder, but that she didn't bring it up or bug me about it because of the irritability of needing sleep/feeling shitty. I'd like to get some outside opinions on whether we should just have offered the seat and whether I'm an AH for being grumpy about the whole thing..\n\n**Edit: To clarify, seat swap didn't happen mid flight. She charged over after 45 mins or less and said we had to give up the seat now.**", "created_utc": 1680036872, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1251ziq/aita_for_being_rude_about_giving_up_a_plane_seat/", "score": 187, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one had a good flight.\n\nThere are lots of posts about people being asked to move from seats they paid for for this reason or that, but that isn't what this is. You were both in the seats you paid for. The question is really, if there is an empty seat *that no one paid for*, should it got to a young healthy person who wants to stretch out and sleep, or a mother with a screaming infant who might be able to settle them better and disturb the rest of the flight less if they have a bit more space.", "NTA.  Sorry but if she wants a whole seat for her baby, then she should pay for it.  You can't just decide you are taking a second seat that isn't even near you.

Worse, she then had another passenger move to accommodate her demands. \n\nThe woman should have gone to the cabin crew and let them sort things out, not go around demanding things directly from other passengers.", "NTA\n\nThe only reason she didn't have to carry the child the entire flight was because there happened to be an extra seat on the plane. She went into this situation knowing that by not buying a second seat she would have to hold the child so I would hope that she may be a bit more considerate as she had gotten lucky.

However, the parent was merely asking you to sit in your assigned seats (if I were the parent, I would have asked a flight attendant to make this change for me, and I expect they would have done that as long as the seats were in the same class). Being a parent of a tired and noisy baby is simply harder than being tired, and you sitting in your assigned seat would have made the flight less noisy and stressful for everyone else on the flight. The best scenario would be that the mom could afford to buy a second seat for her baby and that there were two seats together at the time she booked the flight, but if that wasn't possible, it doesn't seem like much of an ask for you to sit in your assigned seat.", "NTA.

It was just the lack of a special privilege. You got exactly what you paid for and exactly what you expected before you got on the plane.", "I think people are misunderstanding the story here. OP was not asked to move at all. They were simply asked to stick to their own seats so someone else could occupy the unoccupied seat.\nYour whole attitude in this story definitely sounds like YTA.

Do not bring loud toys on an airplane at all. If you're short-term somewhere, even like a very **quick** bus ride, then fine. But if you're somewhere for a significant amount of time, absolutely not. Some people will always be too scared to say something bc of situations like this and the judgment that goes along with telling a mother to do anything or be more respectful. Just because no one says anything or gives you displeased looks does not mean it is not completely rude.", "This made me laugh lol well put", "I agree that the mom should have bought two seats next to each other, but it sounds like this was almost a full flight (given that the mom could not just ask the person next to her to choose a different row after OP stated they didn't want that passenger to sit next to them). Sometimes, you can't always get two seats next to each other, especially last minute, even if you can afford it, and babies aren't allowed to sit in a lot of rows on airplanes (because the number of oxygen masks, and because the can't sit in or near an exit row for safety reasons).", "Good points, thanks for the response. Agree the baby being nosy is understandable, but I personally don't think giving it an extremely loud toy for 6 hours is very considerate to everyone around. Baby whining/crying = what can you do.

She was giving the flight attendant attitude for not automatically giving her the seat, and the attendant just kinda could shouldered her/told her to figure it out.", "Still fail to see why the mom was entitled to a seat they also didn't pay for, that was not in their row.

The point is that we wanted the empty seat to sleep because we were extremely tired, and this woman made it impossible to get any rest.", "They didn't move.  The mother down the row wanted the person sitting next to her to take the empty seat so she could put her baby in it.", "It\u2019s a struggle to bring a baby on a plane sure but if you\u2019re flying with a baby and want the seat next to you for your baby, then pay for the seat instead of imposing on other passengers who are equally as tired as you. That\u2019s just entitled behaviour.", "What would that woman do if there wasn\u2019t an empty sear?", "there were tons of mothers on that flight as well though and it was the only empty seat on the plane, what would happen if the person had filled it.. it's not something anyone should rely on", "She moved her neighbour into their spare seat, so she could put her lap baby into his seat. They could have said no, but it's likely the flight attendants would have told them to move anyway, once the mother complained to them (and you know she would).\n\nTechnically, the mother didn't buy the baby a seat, so she's not entitled to one.

Poster and his buddy had a row with an empty aisle seat. So one of them moved the empty seat and they then had an empty middle seat.

I thought swapping mid flight was fair, but she gave us 40 mns and showed up with the man who was previously sat next to her, basically saying she can't handle it anymore and that's that.

Infants fly for FREE--only in a lap.  The baby never had a seat.", "Yes... babies can be very nerve grating. As a parent myself though I try to give the benefit of the doubt that if parent isn't already doing everything they can, they've likely been dealing with baby for several hours before and have lost the will to live/care.\n\nRegardless, it sounds like a stressful travel trip for you and that sucks. Glad it's over!", "The stranger that moved was probably happier sitting next to you two than sitting next to the baby.", "If I were on this flight and I had seen this interaction, I would have given up my own seat and sat elsewhere if it meant a baby could have their own seat. You had no right to the seat next to you (that you weren't assigned), so your opinion about its occupancy was actually irrelevant to the situation. \n\nI guess it's just a matter of kindness and the kind of person you want to be in the world.", "She was not entitled to it. OP was not either.", "What makes anyone entitled to another seat they didn't pay for? This makes OP no different than the mother. \nWhat OP have done if there wasn't an empty seat? I'm guessing the mother would have done the exact same thing.", ">this woman made it impossible to get any rest.\n\nI think it's time to accept that you can't always get rest while in transit, unless you take a means of transit that has private quarters (and you pay for that privacy). Obviously, we would all prefer infants not to cry on planes, but parents of infants don't owe you a quiet flight. Given that you were so resistant to helping the mom do what she could to quiet the baby (by giving her more space to do so), it seems unreasonable to think it was her responsibility to make sure you could rest. \n\nBuy some earplugs or use the free ones that the airplane provides next time.", "So what was she supposed to do, chuck the baby out the emergency exit? Babies get fussy on airplane rides. The person who moved to your row was probably glad to get as far away from the racket as they could.\n\nYou did not pay for an extra seat. It was not yours. I've had to sleep upright in my seat on plenty of flights. It's miserable and you just deal with it and get better rest when you land.", "You said the baby was given a rattle. Seriously, how loud could it possibly have been -a rattle.\n\nAnd no, it might be an inconvenience for you when a baby is loud, but it isn't any of your business. If you feel so entitled to a quiet plane, maybe a charter next time?\n\nEdit to add: why do you keep on mentioning the stewardess helped hold the baby? That is also none of your business and completely irrelevant to the story.", "As someone who always buys a second seat whenever I can, I think this is an attribution error. At least half of the time when I book transatlantic flights (which I will admit I often do within 2 weeks of departure), I can't get two seats next two each other on my preferred (cheap) airline. If the mother was flying with the baby for an emergency (like to attend a parent's funeral), it seems likely that there were no two seats together the parent could even buy. This seems even more likely given that OP didn't have the opportunity to just move herself to another seat on the flight.", "I lol'd at lap baby thank you for this lol, I also agree that the seatmate won big time", "We agreed it would happen mid flight but the woman demanded it happen 40/45 mins into the flight. I would have been totally ok with mid flight, that would have been fair.", "haha fair enough good point", "Yeah...the worst kind of sharing. lol.", "Right, but a parent could buy a seat for their infant. This is what a lot of posters were suggesting the parent should have done if they wanted two seats. I just meant that the parent may not have been able to buy a second seat for her baby because there were no two seats together anywhere on the plane (at least in rows that babies are allowed to sit in -- babies, whether on laps or in their own seats, can only sit in some rows on planes, making it even harder for parents to buy two seats next to each other).", "I would feel like a jackass, personally, if I let someone else dictate that I take up a spot right next to two other travelers that were clearly going to take advantage of it. \n\nAnd your take doesn't take OP's simple wants into consideration.", "In a perfect world there would have been other empty seats but there weren't.

I've dealt with screaming babies before, you can't do anything about that. You can choose to respect fellow travelers by not subjecting them to 6.5 hours of an insanely loud toy and baby. \n\nAnd no the baby would not have been louder without the toy lol. Appreciate your input, again, but even earplugs couldn't drown this out.", "Neither did she and she could take the noisy fucking toy away so the whole airplane doesn\u2019t have to listen to it.", "It is relevant to show how much this woman depended on others for a journey she chose to make. You cannot simply ask other people to hold your baby and accommodate extra space for you everywhere in the world. There were several other women with babies on the plane and none needed special treatment. Also this rattle was VERY loud which is why it was inconsiderate. Baby toys are baby toys but you could hear this thing from the bathroom on the opposite end of the plane, before business class. It also didn't quiet the baby, so I don't understand why it needed to have the loud toy to add to its noise. \n\nI've been on planes with extremely loud, screaming babies. It's understandable, but what isn't understandable is adding to the noise.", "I think your definition of \"fair\" may be skewed. It seems fair to say \"one person per seat\" or \"everyone only gets the seats they were assigned\", neither of which you and your friend wanted. \n\nThe parent was obviously struggling with a noisy baby. It seems unfair to all of the other passengers for you to take up an extra seat when the baby would have been calmer and quieter if you had just stuck with the seats you were assigned. Your entitlement to a seat you didn't pay for is not warranted.", "You and your friend were two people sharing three seats. This person and her baby were two people sharing two seats. The level of entitlement seems a bit different.", "I think neither the op or the mother was entitled to the seat.\n\nBut op had an assigned seat next to an empty--bonus for her.  Mom took it and that's shitty, but NAH, no one's to begin with.\n\nAnd if the mom can buy a seat for the baby....op can buy a seat for extra space.  This is an argument over what belonged to neither.", ">I wish you the best.\n\nI wish you more kindness than you seem willing to extend to others.", "If even earplugs couldn't drown out the sound from a baby rattle, that would be a magical toy.

The mom was doing what she could to quiet the baby by giving it the rattle. \n\nIf a baby's rattle bothers you this much, you really need to invest in ear plugs. It's not reasonable to expect that planes will be so quiet that you can't even hear a baby's rattle.", "You simply sound upset that someone other than you got the special treatment lol. You also chose to make this journey and you are throwing a hissy fit because you couldn't use a seat which wasn't yours. \nSo, what if it was simply this other passenger that wanted to use this unoccupied seat to get away from the baby?\n\nAgain, none of your business why this woman asked the stewardess to hold her baby. Maybe she even offered. Such attitude because someone got something extra and a kind gesture from another human being. Geez.", "The baby was loud the whole flight with its own seat, I don't understand your point.", ">It seems unfair to all of the other passengers for you to take up an extra seat when the baby would have been calmer and quieter\n\nIN WHAT UNIVERSE is *OP* at fault then when the *mother* specifically booked herself a single seat on the plane. If you *really* think it is unfair for everyone on board to have a baby on someone's lap, then blame the mother for doing this or the airline for allowing this policy. \n\n>Your entitlement to a seat you didn't pay for is not warranted.\n\nNO SHIT, tell that to the mother, lol. OP was even down to share the space mid flight, she couldn't even accept that.

We got lucky, there's no entitlement, we didn't ask 3 different people to move, ask a flight attendant to hold the baby, etc.", "Actually just flew today and chose to not pay for a seat for my baby and had him fly lap. She wasn\u2019t entitled to the other seat if she didn\u2019t pay for it. I kept my baby on me the whole time even when there was an empty seat next to me. Sounds like she decided to fly with a lap baby", ">I wish you more kindness than you seem willing to extend to others.\n\nIronically, rude as fuck to say, lol. It kinda blows your cover that your arguments are being made in good faith; seems more likely that you expect everyone to bend over for mothers.", "Thanks, I'm actually a decent person who works their ass off and is kind where possible. This is an isolated situation that you didn't experience, and relates to someone who was pretty darn rude to everyone they interacted with on this flight. You don't know enough to judge my level of kidness by one minorly rude instance :)", "I have no idea if the baby was m/f, English is not my first language it wasn't intended to be rude.", "Did you not read where it bothered everyone around them? Sorry, you\u2019re having a kid should not inconvenience everyone around you. And she was damn rude to everyone as well. Some people need to stay the fuck home", ">I don't understand your point.\n\nYeah, it honestly seems like you are helpless.", "The point is that the baby might have been even louder without its own seat.", "The parent only asked one person to move (the person next to them). You should have been in your assigned seat. \n\nThe parent was doing everything she could to soothe a distressed baby (something that can be impossible) and you were actively antagonizing her so you could take up a seat you weren't assigned and that you didn't pay for. I think the mother had some entitlement but was doing her best to make her baby's presence on the flight less of a pain to herself, her baby, and everyone around them. You, on the other hand, were only thinking about yourself.", ">Some people need to stay the fuck home\n\nWe have no idea why this parent was flying with her baby, but we all know that she did not enjoy it. I imagine this was an absolutely essential trip (like her parent died or she was moving for a job she had to take). I've had to make these types of trips before (we all have people die), and I would hope that if I had a baby, people wouldn't expect me to either abandon it at home or smother it on a plane so that it were quiet.   \n\n\nPlanes are public places. No one owes you a quiet plane ride (even though obviously we should do what we reasonably can to provide others a comfortable flying environment). Buy some ear plugs if a baby's cry will distress you this much.", "She did sound entitled but that\u2019s pretty ignorant to say people with kids shouldn\u2019t travel. It\u2019s a plane and people have to travel with babies for essential reasons too.", "I'm just referring to the fact that your whole point was wrapped around making the baby quieter by moving. \n\nHope your day gets better you seem stressed.", ">You should have been in your assigned seat.\n\nThey were. The empty seat was next to their assigned seats. \n\n>The parent was doing everything she could to soothe a distressed baby (something that can be impossible)\n\nSo, you admit it is nigh impossible, and the rest of the story checks out that the kid was a pain anyways. You kinda just set it up as a lose lose scenario.\n\nOP isn't required to give up an empty plane seat that happened to be next to them. For any reason. \n\n>I think the mother had some entitlement but was doing her best to make her baby's presence on the flight less of a pain to herself, her baby, and everyone around them.\n\nNo, she did not do her best. If she did, she would've purchased an extra seat for her baby to begin with. Instead, she hunted down anyone else that happened to get fortunate on their trip and took over that free thing. She is being entitled.", "I'm not stressed at the moment, but I appreciate that my comment probably came off a bit harsh. The baby would have been a lot louder if she had had to seat in her parent's lap for a 6.5 hour flight. It wasn't an ideal situation (I have no idea why the flight attendant didn't just ask you to move, rather than the mom doing it), but you asked whether you were the AH, and yes, you were in fact the AH.", "(1) One of them was not in their assigned seat. \n\n(2) Having a baby on a place is definitely a lose-lose scenario, but sometimes this has to happen. \n\n(3) OP isn't \"giving up\" anything. It was not her seat! An unassigned seat belongs to no one!\n\n(4) In a nearly full flight like this, there likely was no two seats next to each other. The mother couldn't have purchased them.", "Mentioned earlier; parent asked the attendant first but the attendant said we didn't have to move unless we wanted to. The mother gave her attitude so the attendant told her to figure it out and that they wouldn't intervene.\n\nedit: the attendant also knew the isle seat wasn't ours but said it was ours to use unless WE wanted to switch.", "The unassigned seat was in their row. It belongs to no one, but obviously the couple in the three seat row is going to have first dibs. \n\n>In a nearly full flight like this, there likely was no two seats next to each other. The mother couldn't have purchased them.\n\nDid she get her ticket the same day or something? It is very easy to get the seats you want. If she is preparing for a flight with only one seat, then she needs to prepare for a flight with only one seat, not to take one without hardly asking nor sharing. \n\nThere is literally no way to argue your way out of this unless you think mothers with babies on planes have special privileges that others do not. You're fine to have that opinion, I disagree.", "You and your friend were only entitled to two seats. If another passenger wanted to sit in between you, that would have been their right. You were not entitled to three seats. The flight attendant was saying you could sit in another seat other than your assigned one, not that you had rights over a seat you didn't pay for (if you think that, you misunderstood).", "Don't change seats with people just because they have a baby.\n\nYou can reserve seats. They should do that instead of nagging/guilt tripping people into switching.", "NTA. Getting a seat you don\u2019t pay for is down to luck of the draw. She didn\u2019t pay for a seat, and has no right rearranging stranger\u2019s seating assignments to suit herself, or expect cabin crew to work double-shift as nannies. She sounds entitled. Babies are hard work, but no one else is responsible for her baby. She needs to avoid traveling alone as much as possible until she can handle it.", "NTA I mean there are no official rules but generally the empty seats are enjoyed by the person that was already sat next to them.", "NTA!\nI would have told her to get vent in the first place.\nAnd your friend is a kowtowing idiot dump her or she'll have you kowtowing to bullies and abusers.", "NTA - next time (if there is one) just say no, and put your things there.\n\nIt's no one's seat ( no one bought it) so no one truly has a right to it. But you're sitting right next to it. Claim it with your stuff, with your butt, whatever.", "NTA. You want your baby to have a full seat, then you buy your baby a damn ticket", "NTA", "NTA. I think it\u2019s luck of the draw if you get an empty seat in your row. She went out of her way to ask someone to move into the empty seat in your row so she could have an extra in her row. It is what it is, you were tired and grumpy.", "NTA she didn't pay for the seat and the rattle was obnoxious", "Airlines need to stop doing that lap baby thing. It's unsafe and a lot of people can't actually manage it. Babies should be in their own, paid for, seat, in a airplane friendly child seat. I don't care if that opinion makes me an AH. The exemption here is obviously on those bulkhead seats with a bassinet that attaches to the wall. \n\nI think ESH. You were both fighting over something that didn't belong to you.", "I have to agree with this one. A battle occurred for a seat that neither owned.", "OP was too much of a Stark but the mom was ready to be Cersei Lannister for her baby boy", "Asking because I don't know: Do rattle toys help babies be calm and quiet? I feel like they would get more excited by that kind of sound.", "I can assure you that your singing toys are equally annoying as crying baby. Heck even most parents hate singing toys and see it as a *revenge mean* gift if you decide to be funny aunt and give their kids singing toys.\nPeople are just too polite to tell you off but yeah, they are indeed annoyed.", "And if op wanted the extra seat they should have bought one. Easy.", "Sure, and if OP and friend wanted an extra seat, they should have bought one.", "Sometimes, you can't keep your face from speaking out loud.", "If you and your baby make loud noise and disturb the whole time on long haul flights you do deserve rude looks.\nYou do not deserve to be yelled at, nor your kids deserve to be yelled at or scolded by strangers but rude looks? Cmon. It is extremely frustrating to be suffering kids noises when you cannot escape it unless the kid is your own.", "It\u2019s ok to give people rude looks when they deserve it like that woman did.", "And if op wanted the extra seat they could have bought one", "And if OP wants an extra seat they can pay for it too\n\nI'd wager the passenger next to her was more than happy to move so as to not be next to someone else's baby on a long flight \n\nBut nobody is entitled to the seat and both OP and the mother sound kinda annoying (but also exhausted and whatnot)\n\nI'd go for either E S H or N A H, I don't think one is clearly worse than the other.", "Exactly. And in this case Ned Stark only survived 45 minutes.", "I always just stuck a boob in.  Voil\u00e0! Silent baby without as many ear pressure issues.", "If it\u2019s freaking out because it\u2019s scared or it\u2019s ears hurt, it might distract them", "They didn't, as described in the post. \n\nWhat they got, was a lucky break. Unfortunately, *someone else* felt entitled to that lucky break.", "[They didn't](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1251ziq/aita_for_being_rude_about_giving_up_a_plane_seat/je316i9/)", "Yeah people can have emotions, just like the mom can\u2019t help the baby making noise - lots of people can\u2019t help but look grumpy and annoyed with the thing keeping them awake when they are tired. \n\nI\u2019m all for parents bringing distractions/toys on plans. But a rattle? FFS That\u2019s unnecessary disruptive when the mom already knew the baby itself was likely to be disruptive. \n\nI\u2019m sure there were more quiet options. Even something that makes noise that isn\u2019t a rattle. The mom is a major asshole for that alone.", "But is that a relevant point to you fighting for the seat?", "Can confirm, people will actively avoid sitting next to a baby. There was one empty seat on a flight I took with my family and it was next to me, because I was holding a baby.", "Anyone on that plane was equally as entitled to that empty seat as they were.", "Lap baby is the officiant airline term for a baby flying without their own seat! Well, actually lap infant, but same idea.", "I disagree, I think it goes to the couple right next to it in the same row. Like I said, lucky break. \n\n*Even if I did agree*, then you should be calling the mother here the asshole for hogging up the seat the entire flight, rather than sharing.", "Babies fly free if they are in a lap", "Well you\u2019d be wrong. That seat can be filled by anyone on the plane for whatever reason. \n\nAnd it should be noted I didn\u2019t call anyone an asshole to begin with", ">Well you\u2019d be wrong.\n\nAs someone that has been on an airplane...I'm not. lol. But, I'd rather not continue talking to a brick wall. \n\n>And it should be noted I didn\u2019t call anyone an asshole to begin with\n\nI'm aware, I was pointing out how moot your point is even if I agreed with it.", "Well, you\u2019re wrong. It should go to whoever is in that row.", "You\u2019ve been on a plan and I was a flight attendant for two years in university so\u2026."]}
