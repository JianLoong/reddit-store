By the time we were going to head home, we were exhausted. To make our flight, we took a 4AM shuttle to the airport and could barely think/keep our eyes open. We had pretty crap seats on our first flight, they were right up against a wall or cubby at the end of the plane and not only didn't recline backward, but pushed forward a little while the people in front fully reclined into us. Needless to say, we didn't sleep, but it was a quick flight, quick layover, and we were praying for decent enough seats to get a good sleep on our final flight home, which was 6.5h.\n\nWe are in a 3 person row but the isle seat remains empty as the plane gets close to finishing boarding. We are so excited at this point, thinking we can stretch out and share the spare seat (we'd move and make the middle seat the spare and take turns lying down or stretch out a bit further and sleep back to back... I was so exhausted this was all I could imagine lol). Boarding is finished, the seat is still empty, and we are SO excited to finally get some sleep.\n\nAfter boarding a woman from a few rows down says she noticed the empty seat and asked if she can switch us (we are a bit confused), then explains that she would ask her seat neighbour to fill our empty seat so that she can have a full seat for her baby. We were visibly disappointed; I was super nauseous at this point and just wanted to sleep for a bit. We asked if we can switch seats after a couple hours because we'd been travelling for a long time and were really rung out. She said ok.\n\nShortly after we were served a snack. The woman couldn't really manage her baby, and asked a flight attendant to hold it so that she could eat. A couple minutes after this, she came over and said that's it, the man is coming to fill the empty seat, we have to move back to our assigned seats and let her have an extra for her baby. I gave her a rude look/looked away and didn't say a word more. She put her baby seat on the seat next to her, now empty, and that was that.\n\nThe baby was very loud, always whining and crying but that's nothing you can blame a baby for. She then gave the baby a rattle toy which was constantly being shaken and really loud, on top of the whining and crying. The mum also shook the rattle toy for the baby to try to get it to quiet down (didn't work) making additional noise. This wasn't once or twice but throughout most of the flight incl. during lights+windows off/sleeping time.\n\nAfter we got off the plane I complained to my friend and she said I was being an AH for acting so irritated by this woman, when she was struggling with the baby. She said I should have been kinder, but that she didn't bring it up or bug me about it because of the irritability of needing sleep/feeling shitty. I'd like to get some outside opinions on whether we should just have offered the seat and whether I'm an AH for being grumpy about the whole thing..\n\n**Edit: To clarify, seat swap didn't happen mid flight. She charged over after 45 mins or less and said we had to give up the seat now.**", "created_utc": 1680036872, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1251ziq/aita_for_being_rude_about_giving_up_a_plane_seat/", "score": 1262, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were both in the seats you paid for. The question is really, if there is an empty seat *that no one paid for*, should it got to a young healthy person who wants to stretch out and sleep, or a mother with a screaming infant who might be able to settle them better and disturb the rest of the flight less if they have a bit more space.", "NTA.  Sorry but if she wants a whole seat for her baby, then she should pay for it.  You can't just decide you are taking a second seat that isn't even near you.

However, the parent was merely asking you to sit in your assigned seats (if I were the parent, I would have asked a flight attendant to make this change for me, and I expect they would have done that as long as the seats were in the same class). Being a parent of a tired and noisy baby is simply harder than being tired, and you sitting in your assigned seat would have made the flight less noisy and stressful for everyone else on the flight. The best scenario would be that the mom could afford to buy a second seat for her baby and that there were two seats together at the time she booked the flight, but if that wasn't possible, it doesn't seem like much of an ask for you to sit in your assigned seat.", "NTA.

Do not bring loud toys on an airplane at all. If you're short-term somewhere, even like a very **quick** bus ride, then fine. But if you're somewhere for a significant amount of time, absolutely not.

Just because no one says anything or gives you displeased looks does not mean it is not completely rude.", "This made me laugh lol well put", "I agree that the mom should have bought two seats next to each other, but it sounds like this was almost a full flight (given that the mom could not just ask the person next to her to choose a different row after OP stated they didn't want that passenger to sit next to them). Sometimes, you can't always get two seats next to each other, especially last minute, even if you can afford it, and babies aren't allowed to sit in a lot of rows on airplanes (because the number of oxygen masks, and because the can't sit in or near an exit row for safety reasons).", "Good points, thanks for the response. Agree the baby being nosy is understandable, but I personally don't think giving it an extremely loud toy for 6 hours is very considerate to everyone around. Baby whining/crying = what can you do.

She was giving the flight attendant attitude for not automatically giving her the seat, and the attendant just kinda could shouldered her/told her to figure it out.", "Still fail to see why the mom was entitled to a seat they also didn't pay for, that was not in their row.

That\u2019s just entitled behaviour.", "What would that woman do if there wasn\u2019t an empty sear?", "there were tons of mothers on that flight as well though and it was the only empty seat on the plane, what would happen if the person had filled it.. it's not something anyone should rely on", "She moved her neighbour into their spare seat, so she could put her lap baby into his seat. They could have said no, but it's likely the flight attendants would have told them to move anyway, once the mother complained to them (and you know she would).\n\nTechnically, the mother didn't buy the baby a seat, so she's not entitled to one.

Poster and his buddy had a row with an empty aisle seat. So one of them moved the empty seat and they then had an empty middle seat.

I thought swapping mid flight was fair, but she gave us 40 mns and showed up with the man who was previously sat next to her, basically saying she can't handle it anymore and that's that.

As a parent myself though I try to give the benefit of the doubt that if parent isn't already doing everything they can, they've likely been dealing with baby for several hours before and have lost the will to live/care.\n\nRegardless, it sounds like a stressful travel trip for you and that sucks. Glad it's over!", "The stranger that moved was probably happier sitting next to you two than sitting next to the baby.", "If I were on this flight and I had seen this interaction, I would have given up my own seat and sat elsewhere if it meant a baby could have their own seat.

OP was not either.", "What makes anyone entitled to another seat they didn't pay for? This makes OP no different than the mother. \nWhat OP have done if there wasn't an empty seat? I'm guessing the mother would have done the exact same thing.", ">this woman made it impossible to get any rest.\n\nI think it's time to accept that you can't always get rest while in transit, unless you take a means of transit that has private quarters (and you pay for that privacy). Obviously, we would all prefer infants not to cry on planes, but parents of infants don't owe you a quiet flight. Given that you were so resistant to helping the mom do what she could to quiet the baby (by giving her more space to do so), it seems unreasonable to think it was her responsibility to make sure you could rest. \n\nBuy some earplugs or use the free ones that the airplane provides next time.", "So what was she supposed to do, chuck the baby out the emergency exit? Babies get fussy on airplane rides. The person who moved to your row was probably glad to get as far away from the racket as they could.\n\nYou did not pay for an extra seat. It was not yours. I've had to sleep upright in my seat on plenty of flights. It's miserable and you just deal with it and get better rest when you land.", "You said the baby was given a rattle. Seriously, how loud could it possibly have been -a rattle.\n\nAnd no, it might be an inconvenience for you when a baby is loud, but it isn't any of your business. If you feel so entitled to a quiet plane, maybe a charter next time?\n\nEdit to add: why do you keep on mentioning the stewardess helped hold the baby? That is also none of your business and completely irrelevant to the story.", "As someone who always buys a second seat whenever I can, I think this is an attribution error. At least half of the time when I book transatlantic flights (which I will admit I often do within 2 weeks of departure), I can't get two seats next two each other on my preferred (cheap) airline. If the mother was flying with the baby for an emergency (like to attend a parent's funeral), it seems likely that there were no two seats together the parent could even buy. This seems even more likely given that OP didn't have the opportunity to just move herself to another seat on the flight.", "I lol'd at lap baby thank you for this lol, I also agree that the seatmate won big time", "We agreed it would happen mid flight but the woman demanded it happen 40/45 mins into the flight. I would have been totally ok with mid flight, that would have been fair.", "haha fair enough good point", "Yeah...the worst kind of sharing. lol.", "Right, but a parent could buy a seat for their infant. This is what a lot of posters were suggesting the parent should have done if they wanted two seats. I just meant that the parent may not have been able to buy a second seat for her baby because there were no two seats together anywhere on the plane (at least in rows that babies are allowed to sit in -- babies, whether on laps or in their own seats, can only sit in some rows on planes, making it even harder for parents to buy two seats next to each other).", "I would feel like a jackass, personally, if I let someone else dictate that I take up a spot right next to two other travelers that were clearly going to take advantage of it. \n\nAnd your take doesn't take OP's simple wants into consideration.", "In a perfect world there would have been other empty seats but there weren't.

I've dealt with screaming babies before, you can't do anything about that. You can choose to respect fellow travelers by not subjecting them to 6.5 hours of an insanely loud toy and baby. \n\nAnd no the baby would not have been louder without the toy lol. Appreciate your input, again, but even earplugs couldn't drown this out.", "Neither did she and she could take the noisy fucking toy away so the whole airplane doesn\u2019t have to listen to it.", "It is relevant to show how much this woman depended on others for a journey she chose to make. You cannot simply ask other people to hold your baby and accommodate extra space for you everywhere in the world. There were several other women with babies on the plane and none needed special treatment. Also this rattle was VERY loud which is why it was inconsiderate. Baby toys are baby toys but you could hear this thing from the bathroom on the opposite end of the plane, before business class. It also didn't quiet the baby, so I don't understand why it needed to have the loud toy to add to its noise. \n\nI've been on planes with extremely loud, screaming babies. It's understandable, but what isn't understandable is adding to the noise.", "I think your definition of \"fair\" may be skewed. It seems fair to say \"one person per seat\" or \"everyone only gets the seats they were assigned\", neither of which you and your friend wanted. \n\nThe parent was obviously struggling with a noisy baby. It seems unfair to all of the other passengers for you to take up an extra seat when the baby would have been calmer and quieter if you had just stuck with the seats you were assigned. Your entitlement to a seat you didn't pay for is not warranted.", "You and your friend were two people sharing three seats. This person and her baby were two people sharing two seats. The level of entitlement seems a bit different.", "I think neither the op or the mother was entitled to the seat.\n\nBut op had an assigned seat next to an empty--bonus for her.  Mom took it and that's shitty, but NAH, no one's to begin with.\n\nAnd if the mom can buy a seat for the baby....op can buy a seat for extra space.

It's not reasonable to expect that planes will be so quiet that you can't even hear a baby's rattle.", "You simply sound upset that someone other than you got the special treatment lol. You also chose to make this journey and you are throwing a hissy fit because you couldn't use a seat which wasn't yours. \nSo, what if it was simply this other passenger that wanted to use this unoccupied seat to get away from the baby?\n\nAgain, none of your business why this woman asked the stewardess to hold her baby. Maybe she even offered. Such attitude because someone got something extra and a kind gesture from another human being. Geez.", "The baby was loud the whole flight with its own seat, I don't understand your point.", ">It seems unfair to all of the other passengers for you to take up an extra seat when the baby would have been calmer and quieter\n\nIN WHAT UNIVERSE is *OP* at fault then when the *mother* specifically booked herself a single seat on the plane.

I tried a puzzle last time, it was fine until he decided that it was more amuzing to throw the pieces in the alley.\n\n Condom companies really don't need an advertising budget, simply recording a parent traveling alone with a toddler would do the job.", "\ud83d\ude02 OK, baby shark is an exception.

I tend to rotate her toys anyway, so I will bring some of the ones I have hidden for months and then get a couple of new ones. The flight is just under 2 hours so my hope is she will sleep most of the time \ud83e\udd1e", "Yeah and OP was there first, then entitled mother made them move. First arrived at the luckily free seat gets it. Simple enough. You don't just make people move like you have every right to demand they do even though you don't.", "I fantasize about adult only flights. Someone please find a way for this to exist, lol.", "You're so tired of people pointing out that people who have every right to be on a plane... Have a right to travel? That's a bit weird. \nAnd OP didn't switch seats with anyone. Someone moved into the empty seat in the same row as op", "He didn\u2019t ask to move. Mom kept entire plane awake with a toy.", "The reasons why they travel with babies doesn\u2019t matter - it is an inconvenience for everybody else and people are allowed to feel that way and most importantly parents shouldn\u2019t feel entitled to special treatment. Why should everybody wear noise cancelling headphones when the baby is the problem? Why should everybody move around when you didn\u2018t even pay for the baby?", "OP is acting just as entitled as the mother. There was an empty seat that nobody paid for. So no, OP doesn't get to claim it and not be called entitled.", "I've been in Hostels with a bed range from 4 to 36. Not saying I ever stayed in the biggest rooms, most I've slept in was a 10-bed-dorm, and while I was prepared with earplugs and a mask, I didn't use them.\n\nEdit: Depending on the gender of OP, and willingness to sleep in a mixed dorm, all-women-dorms usually tend to have fewer beds", "You do get pressured quite a bit if the flight is full or overbooked.", "You could get one of those creepy realistic baby dolls and pretend it\u2019s a real baby, just sleeping. Maybe people will still avoid sitting next to you if they\u2019re afraid it will wake up?!", "You say it won\u2019t kill them to stay home or not fly at all for years, but can\u2019t handle being inconvenienced for a few hours on flights? That\u2019s pretty rich tbh, a child being loud on a flight won\u2019t kill you either in that case.", "Some of us live on an island and all our family are overseas....", "There has been a lot of issues with moms and babies on the planes lately especially when it comes to being loud or feeling entitled to a seat change. I think there should be an area for mothers so other passengers can be peaceful.", "So if there\u2019s a death in the family and you have a baby, you shouldn\u2019t fly to attend the funeral simply because it might inconvenience some strangers for a few hours? There are lots of circumstances where parents need to fly with very young children. And let me tell you, as someone who had to fly with a teething baby, there is no one more stressed about the baby crying on the plane than the parents. Babies have tiny ear canals that are more sensitive to changes in air pressure as well, so even if you\u2019re a pro at calming down baby, you can\u2019t control if they\u2019re in pain aside from giving medicine. Even then, Tylenol might not be enough to soothe a baby in pain. Trust me, flying with a baby is no one\u2019s idea of fun, but sometimes it has to be done. I consider it the risk inherent in flying\u2014you never know what annoyances you\u2019ll encounter when taking public transport, but it comes with the territory.", "How about you don't travel on planes unless you can not be a judgemental asshole? \nAnd how do you expect parents to know if they can calm their kids on a plane unless... You know... They take their kid on a plane? Not to mention that every day and every flight is different. One flight I took with my son he slept the whole time, the other flight he screamed the whole time. The mother was trying to calm her baby but that wasn't ok with OP either...", "[deleted]", "You don\u2019t have kids do you\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t travel unless you can calm your kid\u2019\n\nUnfortunately as individual beings, you can\u2019t control that at all\n\nI lived interstate and had to fly 2500km to see my parents \n\nWas my baby fussy at 2 months old? Yes, and I did everything I could to keep him calm/engaged/asleep- flight attendants helped too by taking him for a walk\n\nWas I completely stressed thinking everyone was judging me if he cried? Absolutely, it\u2019s horrible being \u2018that passenger\u2019\n\nAnd I felt like a right dick thinking of flying in my child free years, and rolling my eyes at a crying baby", "Sorry, my friend, that's just not reasonable. Some people literally need a plane to travel just about anywhere (i.e., people who live in Hawaii, Japan, Ireland, Singapore, Australia can never visit relatives who don't live there while they have a baby?), and a baby crying doesn't even mean the parents are doing anything wrong. If airlines want to implement a quiet car setup, where there are baby-free airplanes, fine, but unless they do, a baby has just as much a right to that plane as you do.\n\nNow as for OP, I get being pissed off but neither you nor the lady had a \"right\" to that seat. What would you have done if the guy had just voluntarily switched? Yell at him? I get why he would; switching a middle seat next to a baby for an aisle on a 6.5 hour flight is a major win.\n\nNAH.", "Mine never sent me to sleep! Can\u2019t. Too much ouch. I think my record is 42 hours from London to Sydney.\n\nI believe I read Shakespeare. I may not have made much sense. \n\nI also said something really stupid to the customs officers when leaving. Luckily they laughed at my stupid. Then managed to get on 2 trains and walk home. I don\u2019t think I made it to the bedroom but passed out on the front porch. Rescued by my neighbour.", "Yup, so do I. Can they visit?", "I don\u2019t give a fuck if \u201cthere\u2019s no one more stressed about a crying baby than the parents\u201d. Holy fuck stop saying this stupid stuff for sympathy points. First of all, you don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. Second of all, I can\u2019t believe I have to say this again\u2026**you chose to have the baby**. \n\nLastly, I clearly said unless you *have* to travel. A funeral is obviously one of these exceptions. You think everyone with screaming kids is travelling to a funeral though? No, no they\u2019re not. \n\nRisk of annoyances in flying should be limited to having to move to let the person next to you use the bathroom. Not having constant screaming in your ear. That shouldn\u2019t be acceptable anywhere. Maybe there should be sections for families with small kids, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m tired of being told I have to accept it, and feel sorry for the parents because they must have it worse\u2026absolutely done.", "Because I don\u2019t do anything that inconveniences other passengers. It\u2019s not judgmental to not want to be stuck in a confined space with a screaming baby. Yeah I get it, this upsets parents - but you chose to have the child, so it is your responsibility. \n\nAlso the mum in this case was trying to calm the kid by making even more noise. So obviously OP didn\u2019t like that. \n\nYeah you can\u2019t always predict, but you can take them on shorter trips in other transport and try tactics. Time the flight with bed time or whatever. Or just wait until they\u2019re older unless it\u2019s an essential flight and you can\u2019t travel another way.", "Planes are public transportation. Parents and babies have just as much as right to use them as everyone else. Just like if my toddler throws a fit at the store, she has a right to be there. I need groceries...eating isn't a luxury. Traveling isn't always a luxury (although it's no one else's business why we are traveling).\n\nI traveled by plane with my young 1 year old and at the time 3 month old and then later like almost 2 and almost 1 year old. It was fine, honestly. My kids were less disruptive than the drunk people or the irritated people who were annoyed my kids were even there.. or the lady with the dog in her carry on. We had bottles/milk cups ready and played my babies favorite movie on the tablet. My 2 year old got antsy, but she wasn't disruptive. We planned the flights around bed time so they also mostly slept. \n\nMom on the flight may have needed to take baby out of the carrier/car seat to calm them. Not sure what she tried, but sometimes it can't be helped..especially if it was the first flight.", "I don't think noise canceling headphones will prevent an entitled mother to force you to give her a seat she didn't pay for but ok", "If you bothered to read my other comment - they don\u2019t work, so stfu yourself.", "The fact that I don\u2019t have kids and you do, does not make your argument/opinion more worthwhile than mine. I know you think it does, but it\u2019s that parental entitlement again. You suddenly think the world revolves around you.\n\nYou \u201chad\u201d to fly? Maybe. If it was an emergency and you absolutely had to go sure. That\u2019s not most parents though let\u2019s be honest. Just because you were having a hard time, does not invalidate our judgment. I still don\u2019t see why I should be totally cool with a screaming baby for *hours*, because the parent is also having a bad time. You consented to having a bad time when you had the child - constant screaming was in your realm of reasonably foreseeable circumstances. Not in mine.", "I was sat next to a baby on a flight home last year and he was mostly quiet and happy. There was a few times he fussed but as soon as he was either fed or someone paid attention to him, he was happy again. I played with him a fair bit and the parents thanked me at the end. I don't have kids and couldn't imagine how stressful it is to travel with such a young baby.", "Don\u2019t use public transportation if you can\u2019t handle dealing with the public. There\u2019s your solution.", ">Time the flight with bed time\n\nReally?? Oh yeah because that will work when there's one flight a day to where they're going. What a stupid thing to say.", "While I semi agree with you (I'm a mom of two little ones but I got very lucky and they travel amazingly well and don't cry on flights,) it's not usually about the parent knowing or not knowing how to calm their kid. It's dependant on the kid and what's going on and usually it's the ears for them and there's just no calming that, like I mentioned before it's luck of the draw.", "Oh, and you\u2019re not coming across as entitled that babies shouldn\u2019t fly and inconvenience anyone? I don\u2019t feel entitled at all, always paid for a seat, cheers\n\nI\u2019ve had bigger issues from obese people that take up part of my seat, people who can\u2019t handle their piss and get obnoxious and those who have to go to the toilet 12 times from a window seat\n\nOf all those inconveniences, a baby is by far more tolerable \n\nDid you \u2018have to fly\u2019 yourself?", "Dealing with the public doesn\u2019t mean dealing with any behaviour. If some dude came and started screaming in your face on public transport, would you just have to deal with that? There are limits. \n\nYou have to have courtesy and respect other people\u2019s space and right to peace in public as best as you can. The public realm isn\u2019t carte Blanche to be rude and inconsiderate. Typical parent logic though.", "The mum in the post did **not** pay for a seat. Also, as I mentioned, paying for a seat buys you the right to travel in that seat. Not the right to make eardrum piercing screams for the duration of the flight.\n\nYou thinks a screaming child is less of a nuisance than someone asking you to move so they can pee? Ah, this surely is a prime example of parental delusion.\n\nETA: I don\u2019t need to \u201chave to fly\u201d because I don\u2019t inconvenience other passengers. It\u2019s the people that disturb that should really consider it their need to fly is so necessary to deserve torturing a plane full of people."]}
