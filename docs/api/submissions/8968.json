She\u2019s kind of quiet, but when she finally talks she seems normal. \nI\u2019ve sat across from her a few times and noticed how she was eating because it was weird to me. She eats maybe half of her food (keep in mind you control the amount of food. it\u2019s cooked by the cafeteria staff buffet-style. \nshe could easily take less) and kind of plays with it with her fork when she\u2019s \u201cdone\u201d (aka eating half of it, sometimes even less). \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything for a while, but a few weeks ago I had to ask her why she always only ate half her food. She seemed a  embarrassed, but answered she thought she was more hungry and laughed it off. I then asked her why she made this mistake every time we ate, and that she must have learned by now. \nShe didn\u2019t really answer (I don\u2019t actually remember, but it wasn\u2019t actually an explanation) and left pretty quickly. \nShe doesn\u2019t really show up that much anymore, but when she does she still eats like this, and I couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. I asked her once again, and also asked her if her parents never told her not to play with her food. \n\nIt was a genuine question, some people are raised in households where manners aren\u2019t important, but obviously they are for most people. She got really mad at me and told me to stop commenting on her eating habits and that it was none of my business. I told her that it absolutely was since she was sitting at our table and obviously wasting food. She told me to go fuck myself and left and threw out the rest of her food (AGAIN!) \nAfter she left, one of my friends told me to leave her alone as she seemed like she was having a hard time and maybe had some sort of issue with food. \nYeah, obviously she has an issue with food?? She keeps wasting it! She hasn\u2019t shown up again, i\u2019m assuming she buys her own food now, which might teach her not to waste it so that\u2019s good. The same friend who told me to leave her alone keeps pestering me to apologise to her, but I think she should apologise to me. She\u2019s unnecessarily rude when being asked the most basic and obvious questions and also told me to go fuck myself? That\u2019s way more harsh than anything i\u2019ve ever told her. \nKeep in mind that I care a lot about food waste and the environment.\nAITA for telling a girl to stop wasting food?\n\n\nEDIT: OK! I\u2019m the asshole! Sorry i\u2019m not studying to be an eating disorder specialist. I looked up stuff about it and i\u2019m realising I was too harsh. I\u2019ll apologise the next time I see her and try not to be so condescending. But you should all follow your own advice. If people genuinely don\u2019t know something you should tell them nicely instead, and i realise i should\u2019ve tried to educate her NICELY about food waste and not have commented at all on how she was eating", "created_utc": 1675374809, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10s22jf/aita_for_telling_a_girl_to_stop_wasting_food/", "score": 1826, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why are you so concerned what this stranger is doing in the cafeteria?\n\nAs much as I hate seeing wasted food what do you think is happening to all the food that isn\u2019t ate that\u2019s cooked at your school? It goes to waste. Same thing happens at a lot of fast food chains and restaurants. \n\nThe fact that you really kind of don\u2019t understand how awkward and embarrassing it is that you felt confident enough to walk up to someone and ask why they don\u2019t eat all their food / is wasteful is odd to me.\n\nWhat if she always thinks she\u2019s able to eat more than she actually is able to? Thinks a dish is going to be good but then after a few bites decides it\u2019s not? Who are you really to say? The fact that you feel entitled to an answer to the question is also odd to me.", "YTA dont comment on peoples eating habits, you dont know if its an underlying ED or whatever reason. She doesnt need to justify it to you.", "YTA if you\u2019re friends are telling you to apologize, it\u2019s with a reason. You sound disrespectful in your post. Go apologize", "YTA YTA YTA \nfrom the beginning you say \u201cseems normal\u201d which is such a rude thing to say like wtf? and second you go on to talk about manners yet know nothing about them , mind your own business the food isn\u2019t coming out your paycheque and if you care so much u can start help providing what an entitled person you are!", "OP - you need to learn that when you are outside of your home, you can't speak to other people that way.  YTA and MYOB.", "YTA - that\u2019s both rude and creepy. Also as your friend said you don\u2019t know her or if she has an issue with food, she could easily be someone who\u2019s dealing with disordered eating or trying to recover from it and your comments could have easily caused some harm there. Also seems like you\u2019ve basically scared this girl away from where she sits/eating in the cafeteria and don\u2019t give a shit about it.", "YTA. I was part of a research trial for people with disordered eating because I have this exact same habit (as well as a few others). It's not controllable, and I'm sure (if I'm correct that she has disordered eating) that she would eat half of her food if she got a smaller portion as well so it's honestly better that she's getting more to ensure that she's able to eat enough. Sometimes I'll get a sandwich cut in half at a dining hall, fully hungry, but I can only convince myself to eat half of each side of the sandwich. \n\nEven if she doesn't have disordered eating, you're the AH. It's none of your business what she does with her food and you certainly shouldn't comment on it.", "YTA - you will eventually learn that you can't control what other people think or do.  Dont waste your time or energy trying to fix other people, their habits, or how they think.  Focus on yourself and also your loved ones,  but you won't be able to change them either - so don't try.", "YTA. This doesn't need to be explained guys.

Like just zip your lips, it\u2019s none of your business what she eats or doesn\u2019t eat. \n\nSecond, it sure as hell isn\u2019t your place to repeatedly scold and try to correct her. This isn\u2019t about manners! She doesn\u2019t own you an explanation or have to live up to your personal preferences just because she sits near you! \n\nThird, you have *no idea* what might be going on with her health, physical or mental. Which is why - again, since you seem stubborn - it\u2019s not your place to have an opinion or make a comment on it. \n\nI don\u2019t know what you thought you set out to do by hassling her, but all you have accomplished is letting your friends know you\u2019re an AH and isolating someone who may already be in a vulnerable place.", "As the sort of person that you clearly don\u2019t like, YTA.\n\nSometimes, you just think you\u2019re hungrier than you are; it happens.  But from a different perspective, WOW what the hell is wrong with you?  When I was in college, I had disordered eating.  If people talked about food while I ate, ESPECIALLY if it was a comment about what I was eating, I wouldn\u2019t be able to finish my plate.  The thought of it would make me sick, I couldn\u2019t force myself to continue eating.\n\nSeriously, it is NOT your business to comment on her eating habits.  You\u2019re the rude one.  Also, if it actually concerned you, there were better, more empathetic ways to go about voicing your concerns.", "YTA.\n\nNow, I do understand how you feel because I can't stand it when people waste food. I\u2019d rather see unwanted food go to the animals instead of a garbage can. However, why are you so invested in this girl's eating habits? Just because you don\u2019t like her wasting food doesn\u2019t mean you can dictate her eating habits or what she does with her food. \n\nIf you\u2019re so bothered by this OP, why don\u2019t you ask to finish what she has left so it don\u2019t go to waste. This shouldn\u2019t be an issue right?", "yta\n\nwasted food does not cause world hunger, it is acess and means to purchase.

What has it got to do with you what they do with their food? And saying you get to harass her because she sat at your table is bull, it\u2019s not your table and she is sitting with her friends. Obviously you are not one of them. You will soon find yourself sitting alone if you continue to be rude, condescending and judgmental.

Nobody's eating habits are your damned business so stop pushing people and whining like she did something wrong by telling you to leave her alone.", "Mind your own business, psycho. YTA", "YTA it's terrible manners to watch what or how other people are eating unless you're their . mommy and they are 3 years old.", "YTA. I was raised not to waste food, too but I was also raised to mind my own business. If you\u2019re so concerned, if she looks like she\u2019s finished, ask if you can eat the rest. Otherwise shut up.", "YTA. That\u2019s extremely creepy that you\u2019re even noticing. I won\u2019t go into the list of the reasons why she could be doing this because it\u2019s honestly none of your business. I don\u2019t like food waste either, but confronting people about it is weird.", "YTA- OP, you're young and in college, this is the time to learn this lesson.   \nIf you actually care about food waste and the environment then go tackle how your school handles its food prep and wastage. You'll do a lot more good in the world if you tackle systems, than if you go on a one woman crusade to personally change the habits of people eating. \n\nAlso, it's horrendously poor manners to comment on someone's eating, particularly as you are not the host (that would be the school). It's incredibly poor manners to question and correct someone publicly, that's etiquette 101, since you may not have had someone explain manners to you (see how condescending that is?) \n\nYou were rude, you were out of line. It's not about manners, what you've done is so much more rude. It's doubtful it's all about the food wastage. \n\nIt sounds like you don't like the girl and picked on something that you could nitpick until you got a response that made you feel like you were the bigger person because she used a naughty word. You're trying to cover up how petty you're being by saying it's about something important like the environment.", "You sound so insufferably annoying.", "YTA. You clearly don\u2019t know her.

I'm not that big into apologies anyway, but she definitely does not owe you one.", "YTA\n\nWhat manners were you putting on display here?\n\nShe's not your kid. This is not your food. She pays for it. It's not gonna cause or end world hunger, whatever she does.\n\nDo you go to every person in the dining hall and Check their tray before they toss it?\n\nAre you needling the chefs to cook less food for everyone, because it doesn't all get ate by the end of the night and gets tossed? No. You don't. \n\nYou seem go have had a traumatizing childhood and feel OK inflicting that trauma on strangers. Seek therapy. Get help.", "Yta. Who do you think you are? You're not special or better than anyone to judge. I'm sure you have quirks too and how you treat your classmate shows one of your less desirable traits. Mind your business.", "YTA sorry.

One comment is fine but you kept going with it.", "YTA, leave her alone.", "YTA \n\nDidn't your parents teach you the importance of good manners.

Also, in some cultures its rude to eat everything on your plate. ALSO it's not generally considered rude to not finish all your food in most of American society unless you are eating at someone else's house and even then, it's only rude to the host whose food you didn't finish. It's never rude to a random person sitting at the table. It is, however, always rude to interrogate people about their eating habits at the table.

Is there a limited amount?  If she takes more, does that mean there is less for you?\n\nIn what universe is this any of your business?!?!", "Perhaps the consequences of your actions have now made her eat nothing at lunch whereas before she may have eaten a small amount of what was on her plate.

But she is paying for it, and guess where that food is gonna end up if there are leftovers??\n\nWhat your friend said was right. She probably has an issue with food. And a real issue. Not a \"she keeps wasting it\" issue, but a she has trouble aging issue. \n\nGo read a bit about eating disorders and how recovery works. You know what iss really common?

Go apologize.", "YTA 100% it doesn't matter how she eats or what she eats. She may have an eating disorder for all you know.

Yes shes wrong for wasting food but you can\u2019t control other people habits.", "YTA and if she has an eating disorder you are making it worse", "Yup, YTA.

She eats maybe half of her food (keep in mind you control the amount of food. it\u2019s cooked by the cafeteria staff buffet-style. \nshe could easily take less) and kind of plays with it with her fork when she\u2019s \u201cdone\u201d (aka eating half of it, sometimes even less). \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything for a while, but a few weeks ago I had to ask her why she always only ate half her food. She seemed a  embarrassed, but answered she thought she was more hungry and laughed it off. I then asked her why she made this mistake every time we ate, and that she must have learned by now. \nShe didn\u2019t really answer (I don\u2019t actually remember, but it wasn\u2019t actually an explanation) and left pretty quickly. \nShe doesn\u2019t really show up that much anymore, but when she does she still eats like this, and I couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. I asked her once again, and also asked her if her parents never told her not to play with her food. \n\nIt was a genuine question, some people are raised in households where manners aren\u2019t important, but obviously they are for most people. She got really mad at me and told me to stop commenting on her eating habits and that it was none of my business. I told her that it absolutely was since she was sitting at our table and obviously wasting food. She told me to go fuck myself and left and threw out the rest of her food (AGAIN!) \nAfter she left, one of my friends told me to leave her alone as she seemed like she was having a hard time and maybe had some sort of issue with food. \nYeah, obviously she has an issue with food?? She keeps wasting it! She hasn\u2019t shown up again, i\u2019m assuming she buys her own food now, which might teach her not to waste it so that\u2019s good. The same friend who told me to leave her alone keeps pestering me to apologise to her, but I think she should apologise to me. She\u2019s unnecessarily rude when being asked the most basic and obvious questions and also told me to go fuck myself? That\u2019s way more harsh than anything i\u2019ve ever told her. \nKeep in mind that I care a lot about food waste and the environment.\nAITA for telling a girl to stop wasting food?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA\n\nI understand the frustration of food waste and doing your part to reduce it, but this was a huge overstep of personal boundaries. I don\u2019t know the reason why she isn\u2019t eating all her food but I do know that when my ED was at its worst in hs, I did whatever I could to make it look like everything was normal, which unfortunately included throwing away food that I hoped people would think I was eating.", "YTA. People\u2019s diets and their relationship with food are non of your business, especially since you only sit with her at lunch? You are only acquaintances, this is not an appropriate conversation to have. \n\nIf you care so much about food waste, donate your money and food, and volunteer your time so such efforts. Don\u2019t be an arsehole about food to someone you barely know, it\u2019s you who is lacking manners, not her.", "yta. mind your own fucking business. geez it takes nothing and everyone\u2019s happy!", "YTA. Not only were you raised without manners, you were apparently raised to be a bully. Yes, wasting food is bad but you have no idea why she\u2019s doing this and frankly it\u2019s not your job to figure it out. She could have an ED, she could have trauma around food, she could have had weight loss surgery which severely shrink the stomach\u2026\u2026you\u2019re not entitled to ANY of that information.

It isn't any of your business, Ms. Busybody.\n\nYou like bullying people huh?", "YTA what if she has an ED and she\u2019s trying to eat more, there are a thousand reasons why she could be doing this but you need to mine your own business as it doesn\u2019t concern you just cause she\u2019s sitting near you learn not to be such of an AH and grow up and stop commenting on other people and what they do", "YTA.  Mind your own business.  You should never be commenting on how much or little people are eating.  For all you know she is recovering from a freaking eating disorder.  Maybe she has stomach issues.  Who the hell knows.  It's you who didn't learn basic manners and what is and isn't appropriate to say.  Shame on you.", "Yta", "YTA", "YTA mind your own damn business. This is bizarre.", "YTA. No matter if she eats it, doesn\u2019t eat it, throws it, pees on it, not your business. She bought that food and she can do with it as she pleases.", "YTA because jesus christ dude it's not your place to comment REPEATEDLY. It's like you're stalking her so you can be a dick to her. \n\nThat said, she has an eating disorder.  I can say this without knowing a single other thing about her.  She has an eating disorder. \n\nThat said, you bullying her is not going to get her the help she needs.", "YTA OP what the fuck", "YTA.\n\nI bet that your friend it right in that this young woman has some sort of issue with food; maybe it's an eating disorder, disordered eating or some other form of anxiety regarding food. Maybe eating with others and/or in public makes her anxious, and there are very few things worse for people with these kinds of struggles than to have others take note to and commenting on their eating.\n\nI don't like food waste any more than the next person, but having suffered eating disorders for a decade (I'm on the other side now), I know how much it would trigger me to have someone comment on what, how or how much I ate.\n\nBut even if she does not have any issues with food but simply has a very low appetite, it's STILL none of your business.\n\nYou know what you could do since you detest her food waste so? Take half your normal portion and offer to eat what she would otherwise throw out.\n\nGet off your high horse, OP.", "YTA, and in fact, it's none of your business.\n\nIf you were really concerned about food being wasted, you could have asked her if you could have her leftovers, put them in a box and give them to a homeless person. But it seems like you just like telling people what to do.", "YTA literally why the fuck do you even care omg", "The audacity of you referring to the other girl as rude in this situation. You are beyond rude. Maybe this girl has an ed. It's none of your business. Focus on your own food. YTA", "YTA.  Are you the fucking lunch monitor?  Has it occurred to you she might be battling disordered eating?\n\nOf course not.  You think of you and your righteous tirade.\n\nYTA.  Leave teh girl alone.", "Nunya...this is what this is...it was none of your effing business what she does with her food, you're not paying her cafeteria bill so why the hell does it matter to you what she does?\n\n\nDid it ever cross your mind she might have an ED? A known tactic is to push food around to make it appear you've ate more then it seems so parents don't question. \n\n\nYTA", "YTA. I am like her. My eyes are always bigger than my stomach. I tend to eat like a bird. I can\u2019t help it; it\u2019s just how I\u2019ve always been. I don\u2019t need others judging me. \n\nHonestly why do you think you get any say in how she eats? Additionally, what do you think would happen to that food if she hadn\u2019t taken it? Food is going to go to waste - especially at restaurants. Get off your high horse, you utter and complete A H. Apologize and worry about yourself.", "YTA. Why are you harassing her? She doesn't owe you any explanation. For all you know she has an eating disorder, or some other mental/health issue. But, again, she does not owe you any explanation. Instead you've made meals an even bigger challenge. Go you.", "NTA. People should learn to respect what they have and cherish it.\nWhy throw away perfectly good food every single time? If she has a problem she should try solving it instead of wasting.", "YTA When I was in my eating disorder and had to eat in front of people this is what I would do because I specifically didn\u2019t want people to really be able to tell how much I ate or didn\u2019t eat. People making comments about me cleaning my\nplate we\u2019re huge triggers for me. How much she eats does not affect you whatsoever, and she obviously has some personal issues going on that are none of your business. \n\nYour preoccupation with something so trivial and inability to read the room are a little bit of a cause for concern as well.", "YTA\n\nMind your business.", "YTA in the biggest way. You have no idea what is going on with her and who do you seriously think you are? Your comments are so inappropriate and I'm glad she told you to fuck off. Did it ever occur to you that A. it's none of your business - just because you are sitting at the same table doesn't mean you get to Gatekeep her eating just because you are worried about waste. B - did it EVER OCCUR TO YOU that she might have an eating disorder? Or a medical condition that messes with her appetite? C. she's unnecessarily rude? This is so insane, I'm starting to wonder if this is a genuine post. YOU were the one that is rude. It's not like you are paying for her food. You sound like an insufferable human  being. I'm shocked you have friends. What other things do you make comments about to your friends? You know, people like you are the reason people like me hate eating in front of people. I am trying to manage a medical condition and often I can't finish my meals. It's already hard enough without assholes like you thinking they are entitled to make comments about my eating habits. If you get the opportunity, I hope you will apologize to her. It's quite possible you amplified whatever issue she may be having.", "YTA as far as you know she has an eating disorder. It doesn't concern you so leave it alone. Apologize to her next time you see her.", "YTA. This sounds like it might be an eating disorder and you called her out.", "You do realize this girl could be struggling with an eating disorder right? Even if that\u2019s not the case, apparently the household where you learned your perfect manners didn\u2019t teach you that it\u2019s rude to comment on what other people are eating or not eating. YTA and yes you should apologize for your rudeness.", "YTA - based on your description it is very likely she has issues with food, like one of your friends tried to say. Issues with food can be translated here as anxiety with eating in public, having anorexia or boulimia or something in that order. The fact that you don\u2019t see her in the cafeteria can actually be a reason for concern as it might be that she\u2019s not eating at all or even less etc. \n\nSo YTA!", "YTA \n\none\u2014 food waste is terrible I agree but your university wastes a shit ton I can assure you they aren\u2019t out there giving leftovers to homeless people or the needy\n\nTwo\u2014 it\u2019s very likely this poor girl has an eating disorder or anxiety. You made it worse and likely have her regressing on whichever it is.\n\nThree\u2014 you were the one raised incorrectly.", "YTA. talk about someone being raised with no manners (its you)", "YTA this sounds like she has an eating disorder, and you lashing out at her like that was completely inappropriate. i understand people come from households with food insecurity, i do too. but that doesn\u2019t give me the right to tell other people how to eat their food. and again, it sounds like she had an eating disorder. just avoid her if you can\u2019t leave people alone", "Where do you think the food that doesn\u2019t get eaten in the cafeteria goes? It gets wasted. Regardless if she ate at all or not they would still be waste from what she left if she took smaller portions.", "YTA\n\nYou're rude, ill-mannered, your behavior was insensitive and obnoxious, and, you were not elected Food Captain or Cafeteria Monitor.\n\nYou may care about the environment, but you don't care squat about fellow human beings in a social setting.\n\nReturn your soapbox to its closet.  Climb down because no one asked you for assistance in cafeteria food maintenance, and, after your FIRST observation, which was questionable, the remainder were unwelcome, unpleasant, unnecessary, and unfriendly.\n\nYou owe her a huge and sincere apology, of which I'm not at all confident you are capable because you feel your position is superior to all others, and, you only are considering a potential food issue.\n\nTo be clear -- you owe an apology for being rude and insensitive, whether she has a food issue or not.  That's not part of your apology tour because, that too, is none of your business and needs no mention *by you.*", "YTA. Mind. Your. Own. Bidness.", "Tell me you've never had an eating disorder, without telling me you've never had an eating disorder.", "YTA. Are you the fucking lunch monitor?\n\n**What if she always thinks she\u2019s able to eat more than she actually is able to?** \n\nHas it occurred to you she might be battling disordered eating?", "\\-YTA-  \n\n\nWhat you're describing can sometimes be associated with someone who has a bad relationship with food, or ED. If that is in fact what it is, you're a huge AH for calling attention to it in a group setting. If you were concerned about HER, you could have spoken to her one off about it, which she still wouldn't be obliged to tell you. Yet, your concern isn't even over her health, but some obscene idea that you have a say to dictate what she does with the food she buys...?  And even if that's not the case, it's STILL none of your business what her eating habits are. You should worry about the food you're paying for and that's it. It's also strange that you would tell her that it \"absolutely is your business\". You seem have this false sense of entitlement over other people.  All in all, YTA.", "YTA. Your attempt to save the planet and reduce food waste was inarticulate and passive aggressive at best, insanely offensive and potentially harmful at worst.

This girl may have food issues but you aren\u2019t helping her by gawking\u2026", "You most certainly can go F yourself. How do you know she doesnt have an eating disorder?? You don't! Instead you assumed that she is wasting food. Which makes you the asshole here. Mind your own fucking business.", "NTA. Food waste is a huge issue and she kept doing it.", "YTA.\n\nThere are a ton of GI, neurological, psychological conditions, and even RX meds that can make make it difficult to judge appetite. Maybe she's using college as a chance to try new food. Maybe she just tries to pace her eating. She probably gets just as much crap  when taking small portions. \"Wow, that's all you want? Are you sure you don't need more?\"\n\nMaybe the simplest fact is this- it's none of your business. \n\nAmerican obesity is stems from what you are expressing- don't waste food, even if you aren't hungry. We have been taught to overeat. And secret- buffets plan the amount they will make. It's already been prepared, and they can't set it aside for later  All that food is going to be thrown out at the end of the meal anyway.", "Yep, YTA", "INFO: Why is it your business at all? Do you police everyone you see throwing away uneaten food, or just this one specific individual?", "YTA - The only person in this scenario without manners is you.", "YTA - this has to be satire right? Nobody would be this ignorant to type this out and not believe YTA. Maybe she has an eating disorder, maybe she grew up in an environment where food was scarce and now that she has access her eyes are a bit bigger than her gut. Absolutely none of your business. I started to feel YTA as soon as you said she\u2019s quiet but seems normal when she finally speaks. Gives big \u201cI haven\u2019t moved past high school bullying\u201d vibes.

The thing about \u201cplaying with her food\u201d has NOTHING to do with food waste btw and really demonstrates that you are just putting her down.\n\nThis is beyond rude. Harassing people does not help the cause of food waste. Please listen to others in this thread trying to tell you that you are not helping anyone, but you are potentially causing  A LOT of harm. Talk to your school about how to change your cafeteria\u2019s system to reduce food waste.\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nMaybe it's the only way for her to eat a proper amount of food, you know? I had a weird thing when I was eating at college in the dorm where it didn't matter if I got half of a plate, I'd only eat half of whatever I got. So, say I got a full plate of food. I'd only eat about half of it. Next day, I get half a plate, I'd end up eating a quarter of a plate. If I wanted to eat a usual amount of food, then I'd have to get the full plate and just toss the other half in the trash.\n\nEven if that isn't the case for this person, why do you care about how much food she gets? Food waste, while unfortunate, is honestly one of the smallest things hurting the environment. Maybe you should instead talk to your school to come up with a large-scale composting program, so that you don't *have* to worry about food, rather than commenting on someone's eating habits and humiliating them. It never *was* your business, regardless of whether she was sitting at your table or not. \n\nCongratulations, you've just cemented yourself in her life as an asshole.

You should learn to MYOB. \n\n2) It is ALWAYS impolite to comment on someone's food, unless it is to say \"That looks delicious.\" \n\n3) She likely suffers from some sort of disordered eating, so you likely exacerbated her issues with your comments and freaking out at her. \n\n4) The amount of food that she is wasting is miniscule compared to the amount of food that commercial food producers are wasting.

You have the right to do so and you won\u2019t be the asshole for doing that.", "This jumped right out at me, too!", "I don\u2019t feel entitled, but I asked to make her think about it so maybe she\u2019ll stop doing it. If she took less food there\u2019d be more for other people to eat. Sometimes there\u2019s not enough of certain dishes or some people want seconds. If it just happened a few times I wouldn\u2019t say anything, but it happens every time and it\u2019s almost all of her food. I just don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t just take less food when you know you aren\u2019t going to finish it. I think that\u2019s a fair expectation of adults. We aren\u2019t kindergarten children.", "I immediately thought \"ED behavior\" when I was reading this. I'm surprised it hasn't been pointed out more. She takes what looks like a normal amount of food because people will comment on too-small portions too.

One comment out of concern is enough, she's an adult and she doesn't have to listen to you. Hounding her about it until she stopped showing up to the cafeteria was too much.\n\nEdit: the ED behavior has been pointed out a lot now which is great, but when I wrote this none of the top comments had addressed it yet.

If someone tried to give me their unsolicited repeated opinions on my eating habits I'd tell them to F off too. \n\nAdding in a YTA for the vote count", "I\u2019m not. I guess everyone thinks I\u2019m an asshole, which I didn\u2019t expect, but fair enough. If caring about food waste makes me an asshole, well, go to the bathroom and take a shit out of me. So many people go without food, it\u2019s greedy taking so much and throwing it out. But i guess i could\u2019ve gone about it a different way.

I'll explain them a bit more below. (Anyone who doesn't want to read about EDs - this is your trigger warning).\n\nThere are different kinds of eating disorders, such as anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorder. A central theme is an unhealthy relationship with food. It can manifest in different ways, such as severely restricting their food intake, binging, and/or purging after eating. Obsessively exercising can also factor in. So someone who severely restricts their caloric intake, for example, can be dangerously underweight. Many experience body dysmorphia where they see themselves as being larger than they are, even if they're dangerously underweight. Sometimes the unhealthy relationship with food is overeating or binging. Despite seeming like opposites, these both can be seen as coping mechanisms (albeit unhealthy); maybe food brings comfort, or maybe they feel like the only thing they can control in their life is food. They're tricky disorders to treat and dangerous.

You owe her an apology. An apology that doesn't try to explain away why you were a dick. If you decide to go with an \"I'm sorry if I hurt you, but...\" everything you say after negates your apology.

I was not allowed to come home and make anything else because it wasn\u2019t fair to everyone else for me to have a special meal.

I hope you\u2019re doing better now and are around better people", "it is wild to me how she STILL thinks she should lecture people about food waste. like how does nothing get through to you and you are in uni?", "EXACTLY. Eating disorders are statistically the deadliest mental illness. OP endangered this girl\u2019s life and keeps trying to defend herself.", "SAME. I'm a huge introvert and growing up most people just commented on my eating habits. Especially since I was very tall and *very* thin but ate a lot but also felt like I was always being watched while I ate so the timing of my eating was... weird. I'd sneak food throughout the day at school and eat meekly during actual lunch because I felt like I was always being watched. Then I'd go game and eat an entire box of pasta. Adults always did this shit too. Like bih I'm a 16 year old girl. The last thing you should mention is my eating habits or my body. And yet that's mostly what people talked about to me, as the shy introvert", "Yeah, minor bullies need a Queen bully to torment the cafeteria", "Seriously. How does OP go on a tirade about manners, but doesn't get that it's super rude to think she has the right to tell anyone and everyone what to do? Smh"]}
