She seemed a  embarrassed, but answered she thought she was more hungry and laughed it off. I then asked her why she made this mistake every time we ate, and that she must have learned by now. \nShe didn\u2019t really answer (I don\u2019t actually remember, but it wasn\u2019t actually an explanation) and left pretty quickly. \nShe doesn\u2019t really show up that much anymore, but when she does she still eats like this, and I couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore.

She got really mad at me and told me to stop commenting on her eating habits and that it was none of my business.

She keeps wasting it! She hasn\u2019t shown up again, i\u2019m assuming she buys her own food now, which might teach her not to waste it so that\u2019s good. The same friend who told me to leave her alone keeps pestering me to apologise to her, but I think she should apologise to me. She\u2019s unnecessarily rude when being asked the most basic and obvious questions and also told me to go fuck myself?

Why are you so concerned what this stranger is doing in the cafeteria?\n\nAs much as I hate seeing wasted food what do you think is happening to all the food that isn\u2019t ate that\u2019s cooked at your school? It goes to waste. Same thing happens at a lot of fast food chains and restaurants. \n\nThe fact that you really kind of don\u2019t understand how awkward and embarrassing it is that you felt confident enough to walk up to someone and ask why they don\u2019t eat all their food / is wasteful is odd to me.\n\nWhat if she always thinks she\u2019s able to eat more than she actually is able to? Thinks a dish is going to be good but then after a few bites decides it\u2019s not? Who are you really to say? The fact that you feel entitled to an answer to the question is also odd to me.", "YTA dont comment on peoples eating habits, you dont know if its an underlying ED or whatever reason.

Go apologize", "YTA YTA YTA \nfrom the beginning you say \u201cseems normal\u201d which is such a rude thing to say like wtf? and second you go on to talk about manners yet know nothing about them , mind your own business the food isn\u2019t coming out your paycheque and if you care so much u can start help providing what an entitled person you are!", "OP - you need to learn that when you are outside of your home, you can't speak to other people that way.  YTA and MYOB.", "YTA - that\u2019s both rude and creepy. Also as your friend said you don\u2019t know her or if she has an issue with food, she could easily be someone who\u2019s dealing with disordered eating or trying to recover from it and your comments could have easily caused some harm there. Also seems like you\u2019ve basically scared this girl away from where she sits/eating in the cafeteria and don\u2019t give a shit about it.", "YTA. I was part of a research trial for people with disordered eating because I have this exact same habit (as well as a few others). It's not controllable, and I'm sure (if I'm correct that she has disordered eating) that she would eat half of her food if she got a smaller portion as well so it's honestly better that she's getting more to ensure that she's able to eat enough. Sometimes I'll get a sandwich cut in half at a dining hall, fully hungry, but I can only convince myself to eat half of each side of the sandwich. \n\nEven if she doesn't have disordered eating, you're the AH. It's none of your business what she does with her food and you certainly shouldn't comment on it.", "YTA - you will eventually learn that you can't control what other people think or do.  Dont waste your time or energy trying to fix other people, their habits, or how they think.  Focus on yourself and also your loved ones,  but you won't be able to change them either - so don't try.", "YTA. This doesn't need to be explained guys.

Like just zip your lips, it\u2019s none of your business what she eats or doesn\u2019t eat. \n\nSecond, it sure as hell isn\u2019t your place to repeatedly scold and try to correct her. This isn\u2019t about manners! She doesn\u2019t own you an explanation or have to live up to your personal preferences just because she sits near you! \n\nThird, you have *no idea* what might be going on with her health, physical or mental. Which is why - again, since you seem stubborn - it\u2019s not your place to have an opinion or make a comment on it. \n\nI don\u2019t know what you thought you set out to do by hassling her, but all you have accomplished is letting your friends know you\u2019re an AH and isolating someone who may already be in a vulnerable place.", "As the sort of person that you clearly don\u2019t like, YTA.\n\nSometimes, you just think you\u2019re hungrier than you are; it happens.  But from a different perspective, WOW what the hell is wrong with you?  When I was in college, I had disordered eating.  If people talked about food while I ate, ESPECIALLY if it was a comment about what I was eating, I wouldn\u2019t be able to finish my plate.  The thought of it would make me sick, I couldn\u2019t force myself to continue eating.\n\nSeriously, it is NOT your business to comment on her eating habits.  You\u2019re the rude one.  Also, if it actually concerned you, there were better, more empathetic ways to go about voicing your concerns.", "YTA.\n\nNow, I do understand how you feel because I can't stand it when people waste food. I\u2019d rather see unwanted food go to the animals instead of a garbage can. However, why are you so invested in this girl's eating habits? Just because you don\u2019t like her wasting food doesn\u2019t mean you can dictate her eating habits or what she does with her food. \n\nIf you\u2019re so bothered by this OP, why don\u2019t you ask to finish what she has left so it don\u2019t go to waste. This shouldn\u2019t be an issue right?", "yta\n\nwasted food does not cause world hunger, it is acess and means to purchase.

I was raised not to waste food, too but I was also raised to mind my own business. If you\u2019re so concerned, if she looks like she\u2019s finished, ask if you can eat the rest. Otherwise shut up.", "YTA. That\u2019s extremely creepy that you\u2019re even noticing. I won\u2019t go into the list of the reasons why she could be doing this because it\u2019s honestly none of your business. I don\u2019t like food waste either, but confronting people about it is weird.", "YTA- OP, you're young and in college, this is the time to learn this lesson.   \nIf you actually care about food waste and the environment then go tackle how your school handles its food prep and wastage. You'll do a lot more good in the world if you tackle systems, than if you go on a one woman crusade to personally change the habits of people eating. \n\nAlso, it's horrendously poor manners to comment on someone's eating, particularly as you are not the host (that would be the school). It's incredibly poor manners to question and correct someone publicly, that's etiquette 101, since you may not have had someone explain manners to you (see how condescending that is?) \n\nYou were rude, you were out of line. It's not about manners, what you've done is so much more rude. It's doubtful it's all about the food wastage. \n\nIt sounds like you don't like the girl and picked on something that you could nitpick until you got a response that made you feel like you were the bigger person because she used a naughty word. You're trying to cover up how petty you're being by saying it's about something important like the environment.", "You sound so insufferably annoying.", "YTA. You clearly don\u2019t know her.

I'm not that big into apologies anyway, but she definitely does not owe you one.", "YTA\n\nWhat manners were you putting on display here?\n\nShe's not your kid. This is not your food. She pays for it. It's not gonna cause or end world hunger, whatever she does.\n\nDo you go to every person in the dining hall and Check their tray before they toss it?\n\nAre you needling the chefs to cook less food for everyone, because it doesn't all get ate by the end of the night and gets tossed? No. You don't. \n\nYou seem go have had a traumatizing childhood and feel OK inflicting that trauma on strangers. Seek therapy. Get help.", "Yta. Who do you think you are? You're not special or better than anyone to judge. I'm sure you have quirks too and how you treat your classmate shows one of your less desirable traits. Mind your business.", "YTA sorry.

One comment is fine but you kept going with it.", "YTA, leave her alone.", "YTA \n\nDidn't your parents teach you the importance of good manners.

A central theme is an unhealthy relationship with food. It can manifest in different ways, such as severely restricting their food intake, binging, and/or purging after eating. Obsessively exercising can also factor in. So someone who severely restricts their caloric intake, for example, can be dangerously underweight. Many experience body dysmorphia where they see themselves as being larger than they are, even if they're dangerously underweight. Sometimes the unhealthy relationship with food is overeating or binging. Despite seeming like opposites, these both can be seen as coping mechanisms (albeit unhealthy); maybe food brings comfort, or maybe they feel like the only thing they can control in their life is food. They're tricky disorders to treat and dangerous.

The whole point is literally to show somebody that it\u2019s not all about you, which this \u201capology\u201d seems to about.\n\nHonestly even if I still think I\u2019m in the right, if what I did still ended up hurting somebody I don\u2019t mention that bc ultimately what I did (even in regards to my intentions) was wrong, so I apologize for that.", "I'm sorry, buuuuuuut", "Yes. Just like that. \n\nIf you add the but or another kid if explanation, it makes it insincere. Welcome to adulthood and I hope you can learn from this.", "So you do that long apology and then at the very end do the same thing just different wording. OP just leave this poor girl alone but if you do apologize, say \u201chey ___ I\u2019m sorry for the things I said it\u2019s NONE OF MY BUSINESS and wont happen again.\u201d That\u2019s it nothing else needs to be added", "You aren\u2019t explaining your behaviour you were justifying it. You shouldn\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I was in the right\u201d. Don\u2019t apologise if you don\u2019t mean it. \n\nApologising is about making amends not making someone agree with your behaviour.", "The apology and the explanation don't have to be the same thing. Try this. 'I'm sorry I was rude. I didn't mean to upset you. I apologize.' \n\nIf you absolutely must combine them, add 'I get upset when I see food being wasted. That's my problem, and I'm sorry I lashed out at you over it. I'll be better about it in the future.'\n\nThat would be a start, anyway.", "An apology doesn\u2019t come with an explanation of why you hurt someone, or a deflection of blame onto them, or a \u201cif I hurt you\u201d. They go, \u201chey, I\u2019m sorry for hurting you, I won\u2019t comment on your eating habits again.\u201d That\u2019s literally it. 2 year olds get it. Grow up.", "Or maybe people lead different lives than you and this is your first dose of that reality. Take that lesson to heart and step out of your condescending bubble", "again, what makes you feel like you're entitled to tell people things like this? it's not normal to go around telling people to stop smoking or stop wasting food. \n\nbetween this and you trying to tell your bisexual boyfriend that he can't be bisexual, i'm wondering if you might have some big mental health concerns you aren't addressing.", "Hey, I'm not your god and this isn't a command, just a suggestion, but learn to mind your own business", "How about you stop giving unsolicited advice? As someone with an ED, your comments and most likely any attempt to apologize or explain yourself would be very upsetting.", "I'm a smoker, I already know it's bad for me I hear it from my doctors and my family. I don't need the running commentary from others. It's like telling a big person their fat. Trust me they already know and don't need a condescending person telling them what they already know. I'm also a big girl as well", "Do you really think you're the only one who knows what's good and bad for people? People who smoke know its bad. I'm holding a smoke right now and I'm not proud of it. You telling me it's bad would do nothing to help. Your idea of advice is like telling people \"the sun sets in the west\", it absolutely does and everyone is already aware. Sit down and shut up.", "OP this might shock you but smokers already know that smoking is bad for them. EVEN THEN, way too many people decide to tell them they should stop. It happens a lot, it\u2019s wildly irritating and smokers spend a surprising amount of their time resisting the urge to bop those people on the nose. \n\nStop telling other people what to do or how to be healthy. Unless they are directly causing you harm and/or breaking the law, how they live their life is their business.", "And I guess being a rude busybody is acceptable where you live.\n\nAnd for someone who made this whole big deal about manners you are the least polite person. Didn\u2019t your parents teach you if you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say it at all? You know, basic kindergarten manners? Or did they tell you the sun shines out your bum and everyone should listen to every word you say?", "Exactly\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc", "I know bulimia but not the second one.", "You obviously need more experience out in the world before you judge others.", "You are unbelievably ignorant. Like shockingly so, it\u2019s absolutely disgusting."]}
