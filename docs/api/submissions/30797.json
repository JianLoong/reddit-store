I\u2019ll call him Richard.\n\nIt\u2019s getting cold and I turned on the heating last week. Richard said on the groupchat, we should all have a discussion about when the heating should be on as we\u2019re all paying bills. Fair enough. \n\nWe never got round to that discussion but I have not turned the central heating on since. I told him if it\u2019s too early to use central heating I can just use a tiny electric heater in the meantime if I get cold. He seemed fine with that.\n\nYesterday I was in the study and was pretty cold. I get cold quite easily by the way - even when wearing layers. \n\nI put my heater on, and after around 5 minutes, Richard asks if I could switch it off because it\u2019s pretty loud. It\u2019s like a fan heated so it does make some noise but it\u2019s really not that disruptive. He asked me to come into his room to hear it. Personally I literally couldn\u2019t hear anything but I said I\u2019ll turn it off and switch it back on when he leaves for a party in an hour. \n\nI thought he was being very fussy since he often plays his music pretty loud and has lots of people over and I don\u2019t complain. I was getting frustrated but had an assignment due so got over it.\n\nThis evening I went into the study again and turned the heater on. He calls me and asks to turn it off. I said okay but I\u2019d like to turn the central heating on then if I can\u2019t have my small electric heater on. \n\nHe said that i was being unnecessary and I should just go to my other room, which doesn\u2019t have any workspace, and use my heater there if I really wanted to. \n\nI said I don\u2019t want to be difficult but that I\u2019m paying equal rent for this study and that I want to use it. I said I thought he was being unreasonable since he doesn\u2019t want the central heating on and doesn\u2019t like me using my heater.\n\nHe then told me that I was being difficult and to f*ck off and then he hung up. He then went on the groupchat and we kind of argued a bit there. The other flatmates weighed in a bit but mostly stayed neutral.\n\nI also mentioned how I don\u2019t complain when he plays music loudly. He said he doesn\u2019t care and that he can do what he wants in his room. I said how hypocritical that was and he again brought up how its not the same since I have two rooms, but I struggle to understand that changes things? \n\nAnyways we all agreed as a flat that we will turn central heating on for two hours in the evening before bed, and that we could use personal heating devices during the rest of the day as long as it\u2019s not excessive since we do all pay for electricity as well.\n\nI said I can try using a different heater that may not make as much sound if the other one was bothering him that much. He didn\u2019t reply that. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m really mad. I really wanted good relations with the people I\u2019m living with and I\u2019ve tried to be friendly and reasonable, but I don\u2019t want to be walked all over at the end of the day.", "created_utc": 1699731621, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17t20ne/aita_for_wanting_to_use_my_electric_heater/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It might be unfortunate but people like that are very much impossible to happily co-exist with - they will always find something to complain about.\n\nStick with your other flatmates, try a quieter heater, and otherwise don't let a control freak make you miserable.\n\nall the best OP!", "Get a small oil-filled radiator.

I live with two girls and our central heating has been broken for the majority of our time in this apartment and we do use a small heater. I share a room with one of the girls and the heater is so quiet that you barely hear anything. Are his ears that sensitive because his music is loud af? \n\nIf I were you and Richard was my roommate, my stubborn ass would definitely not turn off that heater and I'd just see who prevails, but I'm just petty like that.\n\nIf a more quiet heater doesn't work as well as your \"noisy\" one, you being comfortable in your room that you're paying for is more important than him being annoyed by whatever noise he's hearing. Oh, and tell him that those friends of his should start paying rent if they come over often because everyone living in that house has their own business to take care of, and having random people over all the time just messes up everything. I try not to bring people over because I'm trying to be mindful of my roommates. Seems like Richard and I don't share the same sentiment.", "NTA-- This guy is self centered. I think you handled it extremely well though.", "May not be the heater he is fussing about.  People often let you know what is really sticking in their craw\nIf you listen carefully.

And to be frank, since the others don't want to turn on the central heating, well then, you are saving money by keeping yourself warm with your own heater, instead of the main system. It's a win-win!", "I've been using one of those oil filled radiators for 20 years. They're safer by far than one that has a fan driven element. One thing that can make them dangerous is that they will straight up melt their plug and outlet if you turn them on full blast for a long time. Keep it low. I honestly don't even know why they make some that go so high. My newest one goes up to 95! As with any space heater though, you need to periodically check the plug while you're running it to make sure it's not getting too hot.", "I have one too and was going to suggest this. not that you need to appease this guy.... Even if it was a fan he can get over it. I'm super sound sensitive and white noise bothers me but you just learn to deal when sharing space.

It\u2019s still really not that loud in my opinion especially through the wall haha", "Everywhere has inflation and energy costs are up, it doesn't mean you turn the heating on for two hours a day and expect it will warm up a cold home. Run your heater, if he complains tell him he can put up with the incidental noise or turn on the heat.  His choice.", "He made it sound like it's a leaf blower. While he's blasting music. What a prick.", "Yeah he is a massive prick to be honest. More I think about it, more I wish I told him to fuck off. I was pretty friendly with him up until today and thought he was a cool guy.
