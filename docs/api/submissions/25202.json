Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot?  If you didn't want to be a husband and father, why did you get married and father children? I've wanted to be a Dad for as long as I can remember.\n\nI've been sharing care of our daughter since she was born.  I remember walking into work one morning with an emply bottle in my shirt pocket and a \"burp cloth\" on my shoulder.  One particular morning, my wife came out to find me standing  in the L shaped part of the kitchen counter, head against the upper cupboard, alseep on my feet.

If you can't be honest with your husband about needing a day off there is probably something going on that leads you to feel the need to lie about it. Like you wanted a full day off to do nothing...you didn't eat to have to make him lunch or pick up the kid or do the laundry etc and you knew if he knew some of that would be expected of you. So YTA for lying, but he's the AH for making you feel like you had to.\n\nSpeaking on this from experience. I used to do this when I was with my ex. At the time I worked 60-80 hour a week, all from home all with 100% flexible hours for two different companies.  So sometimes I would take the day off, sometimes multiple days off, from my primary job and not tell him. Then I would relax and unwind during the day while he was at work and still work my second job in then evening like nothing was any different than any other day. There were a few reasons for this. First he would have said \"oh good, you'll have time to vacuum/cook dinner/wash the windows...\" or whatever 'woman's work' I was 'neglecting' because I was working instead or \"must be nice to get a day off\" (ya know, from work 80 hours a week...if I took a day off I was still working twice as much as him...WHEN he was working). OR, if I did my second job during the day then he'd expect me to sit on the couch and watch stupid YouTube videos with him all night...not my idea of a fun or relaxing evening.  \n\nSo glad I'm not with him any more.

It is starting to get to the point of YTA full-stop because it's not working for the family as a whole. OP can try to play it off as unavoidable, but OP even admits she's salary and not getting paid extra to work these weekend shifts. So no, she's not working 6 days a week to provide for her family. She's working an extra day for no net gain financially, causing an emotional burden to the detriment of family, and then taking days off in the middle of the week to compensate her well-being but to no net gain for the family by doing something for the betterment of the household. She even admitted her husband had come in and been home and was in the middle of making lunch while she was napping again. She checked out of family movie night to sleep, went to bed presumably before son did the next night, then frivolously takes a weekday off and gets caught red-handed sleeping again and not doing something to help with the household chores.\n\nIn the gender swapped scenario, we would be lighting the husband up even more because it's not like there is a substantial gain at work and only a huge deficit to the family.

I am very lucky my SO is understanding when it happens, and they have the same tendency. If we had a child, then reevaluation needs to happen at that point.

The child is 4 now, probably won't be long till they notice that's not normal. It would even be a good chance of the clich\u00e9 story where a child collects money to try to pay for the workaholic parent's time so they can justify having the parent spend time with them. OP, you are not a department of 1 at work. There are others, and they need to step up so you can have at least a little weekend family time before this inflicts lasting damage to your marriage and relationship with your child.

But lastly, if you are going to continue working a job that takes up so much of your time, even if only at specific times of the year, then you need to be setting aside some of your income to give hubby a break during the season. He deserves a weekend with his whole family, and a weekend off from being a single parent and not having any social outlet. Ideally you could take one weekend a month off to spend time with husband and kid, and then set aside the funds to get a sitter for either the full weekend or at least the days on another so that he can take a weekend to de-stress and enjoy sometime reconnecting with himself, at LEAST for a good 6-8 hours a day. You have every right to take some hours to yourself when you are working at this pace. I don\u2019t think you were wrong in not telling your husband you were going to be napping. I think that you were wrong in not seeing how invalidating it was to be told \u201cI am tired and I really feel I deserved it.\u201d But denying him any space to express the same over single parenting every weekend for several months.

There were 2 different posts one time. Same topic which was:\n\n\"*my boy/girlfriend is the main breadwinner but they want me to start contributing rent to the apartment after they initially said I did not have to*\".\n\n Almost the same backstory (they both used to live with their parents). In fact, both ended their postsby saying \"*I do not want to be a freeloader*\"\n\nHere is the starking differnce in the comments, and I am slightly paraphrasing but the original meaning and wording was basically the same:\n\n**Girlfriend as OP:** \"*Watch out OP, you boyfriend is doing the old bait and switch. I would reconsider this relationship. He already said he is paying rent so its unfair for you to you. You purchase the groceries and pay for your own things\"*\n\n**Boyfriend as OP:** *\"Go back to mommy's uterus if you can't pay rent\"*\n\n\"*you are old enough to learn that you need to pay rent. You are a definitly a freeloader\"*\n\n\"*Your girlfriend doesn't deserve you. Atleast split the rent*\"", "The fact that OP didn't comment on the breadwinner part tells me shes getting paid fuck all and the husband probably earns much more then her, so I can see why the dude is at the end of his rope.", "Did he also know she would show zero flexibility when something in their life wasn't working?\n\nIf she continues ignoring that the current situation isn't working for her partner, her partner can always decide to force the change by ending the relationship", "And people have this notion that it\u2019s government work so they can\u2019t believe that you\u2019re overworked and underpaid. :/", "This.

This is, at max, 25% of the entire year's weekend childcare.", "And she's not even away on weekends for fun, it's work.", "Exactly. People assume it\u2019s always the women taking care of the child. I thought they shared parenting except for the 4 month period in summer", "See, you saying this dude only has to dad for *gasp* 3 months is what's frustrating people. This dude is parenting for 12 months, his wife is only doing 9. \n \nAnd besides this, YTA to OP for telling him to suck it up. We've had scheduling issues in our household and we've worked them out. Both my wife and me have left too busy jobs because home situation was declining, and we're both happier for it. A \"fuck you, I'm busy\" simply doesn't work. From what I hear OP hasn't put much effort into 1) simply refusing too much work or 2) looking for another job.", "Centuries actually. The idea of a woman not working has never existed for anyone but the middle and upper-class. Poor women ended up as maids, seamstresses, wet nurses, factory workers etc. Even going back further, they had no choice but to work on the farm or for the local Lord's household.", ">I will take a day off during the week to offset my hours because our weekend events are the ones I'm most needed at since they are bigger (I'm salaried so don't get overtime).\n\nSo she takes 1-2 days off during the week when the kid is at daycare, in order to work the weekend.\n\nShe's also salary, so no increase of pay. In most places you can't demote somebody for not working overtime.\n\nNot only that, she WONT EVEN ASK for a work around in her schedule. She literally said he should just \"suck it up\". Imagine if a wife was working and taking care of a kid, and she asked for assistance and the husbands response was \"suck it up\". I'm SURE you would be fine with that.\n\nThere is a difference between working around a job to take care of a child, and saying \"i'm not taking care of this kid for 4 months of the year, and no i won't look for a solution to help you! Suck it up!\"", "do you think before you type or just, nah?", "Hm. Can't you call some kind of health services on it?

Jeezum crow. Hard line much?  \n\nI don't differ that OP is a mild YTA. She definitely should've taken over child care if she wasn't going to work or even start thinking of some sort of childcare help for the summer. But, good lord, restricting their right to have a family over this is totally ridiculous.", "Right but this anecdote also isnt this situation is it.\n\nFor one, you didnt say your mother had a job in this example, OPs husband is doing the solo parenting and also working full time.\n\nOP also isnt thousands of miles away at sea, she is right here, in fact she was napping on the sofa whilst her husband was working.\n\nHer husband said 'I'm working full time and doing the majority of the parental duties, all of them on the weekend, we need to talk about how this isnt sustainable'\n\nThe response from OP seems to have been\n\n'Its summer, you'll just have to put up with it, it will be like this until labor day, when we will all have to go to my parents as an FYI' \n\nOP totally blew off his concerns and requests, that's not acceptable in a marriage with a co-parent.", "they also didn't have a kid at the time. things change. jobs change. people are capable of getting into new careers. this a fucking copout answer.", "No most wouldnt, most posts where the father is working to much and can\u2019t really help with children and chores gets completely trashed by this sub.", "She\u2019s working for significant hours 6 days a week. Who\u2019s doing the childcare then? Certainly not her. She has mentioned she just sleeps when she comes back. She doesn\u2019t even cover basic chores like cooking and cleaning.\n\nIf a man was taking offs while his wife was working full time and taking care of the children for the whole summer I bet you wouldn\u2019t have commented this.\n\nIt went into AH territory the moment the OP was able to go for offs (this sub would have crucified a man just for the \u201cnot telling my spouse\u201d part alone) while saddling the childcare with the husband when he has received no offs and has to do disproportionate work.\n\nNo one would\u2019ve brought out the calculators in such a conflict of the man was the offending party and you know that.", "Not being the main breadwinner doesn't mean your job is meaningless to the family.", "OP Could talk to her boss at least and see if something could be worked out.  She's not even trying.  And is OP the *only* person that can do this work or can it be rotated to others?\n\nThere's not enough info, but there's no excuse not to talk to the boss.", "Then time to look for a different job since this one is no longer feasible with her home life. \n\nHer solution of \u201csuck it up\u201d and \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f isn\u2019t a solution. She\u2019s not trying to look for solutions, she simply wants him to take it on and not complain. \n\nMassive AH honestly", "I think OP should take over full weekend parenting duties for 3 months of her husband's choosing. Or maybe even 4 months.\n\nOP, YTA.", "Then she should switch jobs. Clearly her job isn\u2019t fit for family life. Sure career is important but caring for you family is priority number one. Fuck OP and her lazy selfishness.", "This is exactly what I was thinking. The husband sounded extremely reasonable and communicated his frustration extremely respectfully. He's at the end of his rope. He didn't sign up to be a single parent for 3 months every year. OP needs to listen to her husband before he calls it quits.", "Its really not that far-fetched that she might consider having another kid.  And that her husband would shoot it down.", "Truth, the cope is strong here", "All of that is in reference to her summer working hours. And it's mentioned in the original post that the kid is going to daycare so please don't try to act like the husband is oh the hook for 100% of the childcare for 6 days of the week, neither of them is.\n\nWorking in the public sector, life will be like that sometimes. Hell, many jobs have time periods like this - retail has every fucking holiday season, finance/accounting has january-march, anything to do with Medicare has October-December, etc. Sometimes, life sucks or is not entirely fair. Sometimes your wife is so exhausted from work that she falls asleep on the sofa and calls in to work. That sucks. Maybe take advantage of her being a little more rested and make plans to talk about it over dinner instead of getting pissed off and going to the bar after work.", "The thing is, she's not doing 50% of their parenting job. So it's her job at this point to find a solution to solve her issue. Your mom's situation doesn't apply here.", "The problem here is that they discussed this prior to having the kid. They BOTH made that choice to make that kid. The husband isn\u2019t liking the reality of an agreement they both made knowing this. Consider that OP isn\u2019t selfish or lazy for wanting to give up a stable consistent job, but her husband isn\u2019t invalid for being frustrated - seeking alternative childcare for the weekends to provide them both a break is the solution here.", ">he didn\u2019t sign up to be a single parent for 3 months every year \n\nIf she had this job and schedule before they had this kid - which she did - and it was agreed she\u2019d return to the job, he kind of did sign up for that though? He knew going into this, neither of them thought it all the way through. \n\nThe answer is paid childcare being involved in the weekends because that\u2019s what would happen if this causes a divorce.", "No it isn\u2019t, OP is taking zero responsibility for household duties and parenting 3 to 4 months out of the year. And is negligent of her partners needs. Whereas her Husband is responsible and take care of household duties, work and parenting. Whereas OP does nothing even on her days off which is the definition of lazy when you have adult responsibilities. \n\n\nThe solution here is obviously for the Husband to get a divorce and find someone who deserves him and take care of his needs just as he takes care of his partners needs. Or for her to apologize and straighten the fuck out instantly, get a job that fits family life and take care of her responsibilities. \n\n\nIf the gender roles were reversed this would be the answer from the whole sub. But now she is just a career woman. But in reality she is an asshole that takes zero responsibility for family and partner just care about her job.", "If he divorces he\u2019ll be a single parent and have to do everything himself 100% of the time and not just for 3 months. Don\u2019t think that\u2019s better.", "That\u2019s what he\u2019s been doing anyway. There\u2019s no difference from right now.", "If he divorces he has the opportunity to find a partner that deserves him."]}
