His argument is that there is nothing he does that leaves me parenting by myself for similar amounts of time and that there needs to be more of a balance in that area.  \n\nThis past weekend I had events on both Saturday and Sunday, full 8 hour days in outside in the heat.

If you can't be honest with your husband about needing a day off there is probably something going on that leads you to feel the need to lie about it. Like you wanted a full day off to do nothing...you didn't eat to have to make him lunch or pick up the kid or do the laundry etc and you knew if he knew some of that would be expected of you. So YTA for lying, but he's the AH for making you feel like you had to.\n\nSpeaking on this from experience. I used to do this when I was with my ex. At the time I worked 60-80 hour a week, all from home all with 100% flexible hours for two different companies.  So sometimes I would take the day off, sometimes multiple days off, from my primary job and not tell him. Then I would relax and unwind during the day while he was at work and still work my second job in then evening like nothing was any different than any other day. There were a few reasons for this. First he would have said \"oh good, you'll have time to vacuum/cook dinner/wash the windows...\" or whatever 'woman's work' I was 'neglecting' because I was working instead or \"must be nice to get a day off\" (ya know, from work 80 hours a week...if I took a day off I was still working twice as much as him...WHEN he was working). OR, if I did my second job during the day then he'd expect me to sit on the couch and watch stupid YouTube videos with him all night...not my idea of a fun or relaxing evening.  \n\nSo glad I'm not with him any more.
