His argument is that there is nothing he does that leaves me parenting by myself for similar amounts of time and that there needs to be more of a balance in that area.  \n\nThis past weekend I had events on both Saturday and Sunday, full 8 hour days in outside in the heat.

Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot?  If you didn't want to be a husband and father, why did you get married and father children? I've wanted to be a Dad for as long as I can remember.\n\nI've been sharing care of our daughter since she was born.  I remember walking into work one morning with an emply bottle in my shirt pocket and a \"burp cloth\" on my shoulder.  One particular morning, my wife came out to find me standing  in the L shaped part of the kitchen counter, head against the upper cupboard, alseep on my feet.

If you can't be honest with your husband about needing a day off there is probably something going on that leads you to feel the need to lie about it. Like you wanted a full day off to do nothing...you didn't eat to have to make him lunch or pick up the kid or do the laundry etc and you knew if he knew some of that would be expected of you. So YTA for lying, but he's the AH for making you feel like you had to.\n\nSpeaking on this from experience. I used to do this when I was with my ex. At the time I worked 60-80 hour a week, all from home all with 100% flexible hours for two different companies.  So sometimes I would take the day off, sometimes multiple days off, from my primary job and not tell him. Then I would relax and unwind during the day while he was at work and still work my second job in then evening like nothing was any different than any other day. There were a few reasons for this. First he would have said \"oh good, you'll have time to vacuum/cook dinner/wash the windows...\" or whatever 'woman's work' I was 'neglecting' because I was working instead or \"must be nice to get a day off\" (ya know, from work 80 hours a week...if I took a day off I was still working twice as much as him...WHEN he was working). OR, if I did my second job during the day then he'd expect me to sit on the couch and watch stupid YouTube videos with him all night...not my idea of a fun or relaxing evening.  \n\nSo glad I'm not with him any more.

Someone having an illness that limits their ability to do things is *very* different.\n\nAlso, her husband is literally saying he is not ok with this situation and her lack of effort to change it.", "So if he\u2019s said that why haven\u2019t you taken it seriously and try to come to a compromise that meets both your needs. Cause every day you don\u2019t is like flipping him the bird and saying his feelings and needs aren\u2019t a priority.", "There is no way to make up for something that bad", "Being the sole parent for that long is really unfair.", "That's the thing. If your husband were a police officer or firefighter, or otherwise had to work a lot of overtime, nobody would question you getting \"stuck\" with the lion's share of parenting, even if you were working full time. What if he were in the military, a long-haul truck driver, or had to travel a lot for work? Same thing. But if he has to step up because of your work schedule, somehow that's not fair?  Run that one by me again, I must have missed something. NTA.", "Yeah that\u2019s not cool. Maybe you take your son and go to your parents\u2019 place and your husband gets a weekend to chill out. You could be at least trying to be equitable about this.", "So basically, the only possible free day he could have is now filled with another one of your obligations..\n\nI'm still leaning NAH, but I am seeing a pattern.", "Then you take your son to your parents and give the poor dude a weekend off. He can plan a trip with friends, bbq, go out with other adults without a child, or he can sleep until noon, eat takeout, and play video games. He needs a weekend off.", "I'd find a way to make some time for him. Date night, whatever. You both sound burned out. Make some time for each other.", "So take your son yourself and give your husband the weekend off", "Everyone sucks here", "OP's boss is getting one heck of a bargain employee though, why would anything change? She's both doing more work than she probably should, but she's salaried so it's LITERALLY not in the interest of anyone but OP's family to make a change.\n\nOP is going to have to find for herself what \"enough\" means, because as far as the boss is concerned, this is the new normal for as long as she keeps this up. \n\nBut something's going to give out, and in an extreme case how is OP going to manage on summer weekends when she's a single mom and it isn't Dad's time?", "I wouldn't really compare a cop/fire fighter/military personnel to park event management. These jobs aren't the same. You missed a lot because if OP had one of those kinds of jobs then I'm sure the response would be a bit different. Apples and oranges aren't the same fruit."]}
