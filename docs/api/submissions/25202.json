His argument is that there is nothing he does that leaves me parenting by myself for similar amounts of time and that there needs to be more of a balance in that area.  \n\nThis past weekend I had events on both Saturday and Sunday, full 8 hour days in outside in the heat.

If you can't be honest with your husband about needing a day off there is probably something going on that leads you to feel the need to lie about it. Like you wanted a full day off to do nothing...you didn't eat to have to make him lunch or pick up the kid or do the laundry etc and you knew if he knew some of that would be expected of you. So YTA for lying, but he's the AH for making you feel like you had to.\n\nSpeaking on this from experience. I used to do this when I was with my ex. At the time I worked 60-80 hour a week, all from home all with 100% flexible hours for two different companies.  So sometimes I would take the day off, sometimes multiple days off, from my primary job and not tell him. Then I would relax and unwind during the day while he was at work and still work my second job in then evening like nothing was any different than any other day. There were a few reasons for this. First he would have said \"oh good, you'll have time to vacuum/cook dinner/wash the windows...\" or whatever 'woman's work' I was 'neglecting' because I was working instead or \"must be nice to get a day off\" (ya know, from work 80 hours a week...if I took a day off I was still working twice as much as him...WHEN he was working). OR, if I did my second job during the day then he'd expect me to sit on the couch and watch stupid YouTube videos with him all night...not my idea of a fun or relaxing evening.  \n\nSo glad I'm not with him any more.

It is starting to get to the point of YTA full-stop because it's not working for the family as a whole. OP can try to play it off as unavoidable, but OP even admits she's salary and not getting paid extra to work these weekend shifts. So no, she's not working 6 days a week to provide for her family. She's working an extra day for no net gain financially, causing an emotional burden to the detriment of family, and then taking days off in the middle of the week to compensate her well-being but to no net gain for the family by doing something for the betterment of the household.

The child is 4 now, probably won't be long till they notice that's not normal. It would even be a good chance of the clich\u00e9 story where a child collects money to try to pay for the workaholic parent's time so they can justify having the parent spend time with them. OP, you are not a department of 1 at work. There are others, and they need to step up so you can have at least a little weekend family time before this inflicts lasting damage to your marriage and relationship with your child.

Are we even reading the same thing?!", "I would be fed up too if my loved one is just disregarding how I\u2019m feeling time and time again. If you read the post the husband has brought this up MULTIPLE times in the past and OP\u2019s response is always \u201csuck it up\u201d. How is that mature at all on OP\u2019s side? At some point the husband will (and probably already has) reached his breaking point and has become curt with her since she\u2019s not listening. She should feel bad. He\u2019s literally given options (talking to her manager to get others to cover) but OP shoots down all those options. Seems like you\u2019re just sexist and take the woman\u2019s side because she\u2019s a woman.", "Ah I didn\u2019t know working a full time job and being a single parent for 1/4 of the year is the bare minimum. Gotcha. Nice try though.", "Yikes, what an odd response", "I feel sorry for him", "Seriously, it takes FOREVER. I just got hired into a city government role and I submitted my resume mid-May, had my first interview June 1, and didn't actually start work until just over a week ago. About 10 weeks from interview to starting. I almost gave up somewhere around the third set of post-offer-pre-hire hoops to jump through and started applying elsewhere. And that's for a well-paid full-time professional role that was perfect for my skills and long-term career goals, I can't imagine sticking around that long for a part-time position.\n\nIt's really not as simple as \"just hire more people\".", ">I\u2019m not allowed to place office supply orders right now. \n\nUgh. Our statewide contract for office supplies expired and then got challenged. No contract for *months*. It was awful. And the new winner is a local company... who's already backing out of providing items.", "Oh man. We met our maximum cost for facility improvements for one project so I\u2019m having to get paint using one of our other budget accounts for a remodel project at our facility to hang onto until October 1st when we can get the rest of our supplies", "Exactly.\n\nIt would be awesome if the parents had an easier schedule in the summer, when most kids have the most time off. But that's not reality right now. \n\nI am having a bit of a giggle at people saying she should just demand the parks service hire more people - as if that's something she has any control over. I only have experience with the Canadian government but the the budgets are not something you can play fast and loose with, and hiring takes *forever*.\n\nNAH.\n\nYou can totally have a family talk about changing careers if this is intractable, or getting Husband some help in the summer time if a career change isn't feasible. But this is not a problem that will be solved in a night.", "Isn't summer usually when kids have time off school though?", "The extra hours do nothing to \"put food on the table\" because they are unpaid.  Another comment confirmed a root cause is that the people they hire do not stick around.  I'm guessing that giving up all your summer weekends for unpaid work may be influencing those decisions.\n\nShe's obviously a very capable, hard worker.  But she is choosing a really crappy employer that is taking advantage of her over her family.\n\nYou would have an argument if all this was time-and-a-half...but it's unpaid, so you don't.", "You must not have a family or kids?? Some employer that can replace me in a heart beat isn't going to be my.top priority ever.", "Are you stupid? \"Childcare should be shared.\" Yes, that's exactly the point.", "Exactly! Childhood should be shared. And she\u2019s not doing her part.", "Totally YTA \n\nEspecially after this parents comment\nOnly free weekend, and doesn't prioritize husband/PARTNER, at all.", "Here\u2019s one weird trick that schools don\u2019t want you to know\u2026you can take your kids out of school whenever you want! We do it all the time and the experiences he\u2019s had are far more important than whatever he would have learned those weeks a school.", "Does she not take care of him during the week & on weekends the rest of the year? Sounds like you're the stupid one.", "She's not taking care of him during the week & on weekends the rest of the year?", "Depends where you are.  Over here you need to request in advance and you must need the principal's permission.  If the principal doesn't grant it, then the law can get involved and you can face hefty fines.", "There are too many people who think jobs grow on a job tree, and that people work 12hrs a day 6 days a week because they like it or something (that's the usual tell that the person saying it has never worked a 12hr day in their life). So the usual advice the youth of AITA like to give is \"lol just get a new job, cut your hours, tell your boss you don't want to work more than 40, duh\" because they have no concept of work being something other than logging in for a few hours from the comfort of their living room.  \n\n*That being said*, the judgment from AITA would come down on the side of the parent doing the actual parenting because even if you're working construction out in the heat all day, it's a dick move to schedule your only day off during the middle of the week while the kid is at daycare and then act like \"that's the way it's always been\" is a good excuse for it.   Doesn't matter how noble the job is; OP could be performing heart surgery on neonates, or tying balloon animals while dressed as Elsa, but the result is the same. At the end of the day, she's burning out her husband because \"well I've just always done this\" and refuses to see that having a child really does change everything.", "Do you have kids? You don\u2019t just check out for 3-4 months. She\u2019s putting her job ahead of her child. I was in the same position she was. Working long hours to make extra money. And my wife asked me to slow down , to have more time with her and the kids. Do you think it would\u2019ve be ok to turn her down because it was our busy part of the year?", "That\u2019s some bullshit. I guarantee you that his trip to the louvre/Eiffel tower/buckingham palace was much more educational than reading it in a book. \n\nWe\u2019ve sent a courtesy email to the teacher and then put the absences into the attendance portal and that\u2019s it.", "Ask anyone managing those departments if they have enough supervisory folk. In pretty much any country where funding is handled in a similar way. Canada is the same\u2014I live here now. My ex who is a nonprofit worker in the UK reports similar challenges. Interns and youth workers don\u2019t typically run events, though they\u2019re essential. A parks event involving, for example, children\u2019s activities requires coordination of safety, materials, frontline workers, performers/leaders, all those seasonal workers, building access management, custodial stuff\u2026yikes. The mid-level managers get a lot piled on them.\n\nDemand better from your municipal/metro governments, so that folk like OP\u2019s spouse can expect better when they pair off with municipal workers.", "This isn\u2019t hard to know, for anyone who reads local news and troubles to check out how their tax money is used.", "Sounds like op isn't sacrificing anything", "In fact, yes, because it happens in my industry as well. Stop expecting people to change. She's not \"checked out\" by working weekends. Do you know how many thousands of parents work weekends? That doesn't make them \"checked out.\"", "Plenty of people just check out for months. People in the army do and their partners manage. Just because she's physically in the area doesn't mean she has the ability to look after the child safely. Other people have mentioned there's no way she can make it so she works less hours because her position is needed.\n\nYes, husband needs help, but it's totally ridiculous to act like parenting alone is totally impossible and cruel when many just have no choice in it and don't get a respite when the busy season is over.", "I can see this is a sensitive issue for you so I can empathize, but my point still stands: yes, OP should spell it out because not all governments work the same.", "Not being hard to know does not equal common knowledge. There\u2019s a large difference.", "Working 6 says a week to provide for her family isn't sacrificing? Jesus this sub can be so sexist. When a man works long hours to take care of his family he is providing so why can't a woman do it? They are both contributing to the family, and this is only a few months out of the year.", "Not just \u201cweekends\u201d. Read the story. Months! She gets home, falls right asleep. Even on her 1day off, she fell asleep on family night. She\u2019s checked out in favour of her job.", "It sounds like she's not trying to change it, and it is ungrateful dismissing her partners concerns. And it's a 3rd of the year every year. Also my own brother works one of those jobs and I feel sorry for his partner because she's a single mom majority of the time. So it sucks when either gender does it. Don't try to justify her shitty behavior by saying other people are shitty too.", "I did read the story. Does it say she does that every day?Have you never just been worn out & slept on a weekend or your day off or immediately when you got home?"]}
