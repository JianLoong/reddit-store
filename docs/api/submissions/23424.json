But I would never act on it. \n1. Someone who deliberately angles between 4 spots clearly has a big ego and I wouldn\u2019t want a confrontation with that potentially aggressive person. \n2. Old people park terribly. Will you feel good about yourself for making an 87 year old crawl through the passenger door? (They should probably not be on the road.

I know it\u2019s rarely true but I try to think that maybe people are going through something terrible and that\u2019s why they do careless things like that. Lots of things like illness or other hardships can make people distracted or just not care enough to fix a bad parking job. \n\nAnyway, I think your anxiety will likely stop you from doing it again.
