I got in my car and drove to a completely different store on the opposite side of town.

If you're comfortable squeezing past doors to park in the center, by all means go for it, you're doing others a favor.  Sometimes though, you need to park off-center because of where the other cars are.  For this, see point (2) above.  \n\n\nThe reasons you never have to park off-center include:\n\n\\-other people will park 'correctly' later and then you will be boxed in, looking like the jerk who parked off-center  \n\\- this encourages a 'cascade' effect where people park more-and-more off center and then, finally, **someone thinks it is reasonable to park over the lines** because everybody else is off center.  This just makes the problem worse.\n\nBottom line, a driver pulling into a spot should be comfortable with other cars being literally anywhere inside the adjacent spots.  If you aren't prepared to accept this, don't take that spot.  \n\nYes, some parking lots are garbage and have tiny spaces.  Parking off-center only makes problems worse for everyone, but sometimes it is a necessary evil.  You are never TA if you park in the center.  You are only TA if you park off-center and you did it purely to F with someone.\n\nFinally, this will trigger some people, nobody forced you to buy a large vehicle.

That was funny", "Being on the spectrum literally has absolutely nothing to do with this unless you mean the asshole spectrum.  **Stop attributing everything to being on the spectrum.

Also I'm sure the store didn't scope out the parking situation before doing the announcement the other driver requested. Otherwise I doubt they'd have done it.", "No need to be part of a cascade of assholes.", "Well yeah, you look like a bad parker because you are one. If some A-Hole takes up two spaces and you CHOOSE to park in that tight space resulting in your car peaking into the other lane, then you are also a bad parker. Two Wrongs Don't Make a Right.

You\u2019re a cowardly one, too!", "NTA\n\nYou were parked in your spot legally.  They parked badly.  There was nothing stopping them from fixing their parking when they first pulled in.\n\nI parked in a carpark last night.  There was lots of spots in the row and I parked about 4 spots away from the next car.  When I got out from the shop I was in, there was this big arsed SUV parked so badly next to me in the next spot (they could've parked with a spot in between too).  There was so much room to get into the spot that they shouldn't have been skewiff at all.\n\nI had no issues getting out (because I had so much room to just back out but otherwise it would've been harder).  What I really wanted to do is put a note on the drivers window about how bad their parking was, did I need to report it to the DMV as you may need to resit your driving test... or do you need glasses to see.", "YTA and you\u2019re a coward. \n\nYou don\u2019t even have the balls to back up your own dumb actions.", "NTA for sure, parking is one of the easiest parts of driving and if you don't at least part inside the lines you're either a massive bellend or you're too goddamn stupid to be on the road. Used to live in a shitty converted motel where my neighbour would regularly park in one of my two spots. I only had one car, but it was right at the end of the driveway so I needed the second park to turn around, otherwise I had to reverse the entire drive and dodge every other car. I was capable, but it was a massive hassle, especially considering they had their own park, they just decided to use my park as well for their second car.
