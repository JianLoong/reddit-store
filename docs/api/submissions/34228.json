We get along pretty well for the most part but here\u2019s the thing - she\u2019s HORRIBLE with money.\n\nShe can never keep it and never has enough it. I\u2019m lucky enough to have started an Etsy business when I was 15 so I have some disposable income. Which means my sister keeps borrowing cash from me. A 20 here, a 50 there.\n\nSometimes I let her keep the cash, sometimes I ask her for it. Sometimes she pays, sometimes she doesn\u2019t.\n\nBut towards the end of October last year (2023), she called and asked for a pretty big loan. 1500$ and promised to pay it all back. For a 19 year old making her own money, 1500$ is a LOT of cash. She said she\u2019ll pay me with her next paycheck and just needed it to \u201cget by\u201d so I agreed.\n\nWell, getting by apparently means buying an iPhone 15 Pro with a loan she got from me. A loan that she kept refusing to pay back, despite her getting paid biweekly and knowing she can pay me back with just one paycheck. \n\nI think what irritated me the most was that she used money I removed from my savings to buy a phone. I didn\u2019t want to bring this up during Christmas so I waited until afterwards and asked her about my money. She was loud and combative and the conversation didn\u2019t go anywhere.\n\nNow usually, my grandma gifts us cash for Christmas. It really depends on the interest she\u2019s gotten out of her investments. Guess how much each grandkid got? Exactly 1500$. And guess how much my sister got? Exactly 0. \n\nThis was bc granny hands out the cash in envelopes and usually gives an envelope to a present sibling to pass on (we\u2019re 7 grandkids). \n \n I didn\u2019t pass on my sister\u2019s envelope.\n\nWell, my sister found out. She called me and screamed at me for \u201cstealing\u201d her money and said I should pay it back immediately or else she\u2019d sue me. I reminded her that she owes me much more than 1500$ (honestly, maybe even up to 5k cause 20\u2019s over the course of 3 years realllyyyyy adds up) and I just took back what she owed me.\n\nMy family is pretty much evenly split. My older brother and younger brother all agree with what I did as she borrows them money and doesn\u2019t pay back but my parents and my oldest sister say it\u2019s not the right way to go about \u201cconflict resolution\u201d. \n\nSo Reddit, am I the AITA here?", "created_utc": 1704230843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18x0vdq/aita_for_stealing_my_sisters_money/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She borrowed money for a phone of all things, promised to pay it back with her next paycheck and has shown no indication of actually doing it.

Her owing you money doesn't give you the right to take money given to her by someone else. If she owes you, you should sue her or stop loaning her money but to just take the money doesn't make you any better than her.", "YTA.. but its justified.. boo hoo to her.", "YTA.  You stole from your grandmother, not your sister.

You broke that trust with your grandmother.  So, in that way, you are an asshole in this situation.

Learn from this. Secure your cash and stop giving money to this ingrate.", "NTA - Easiest solution is to stop lending her money though, she is bad with  money in part because she is being enabled. You're young so I get why you have in the past but at some point you need to turn off the tap.", "NTA. But what is wrong with you? Why do you lend your sister money? She should borrow from your parents. Stop giving her money.", "I think my biggest issue is that what she did is technically a crime. I believe a lot of people are overlooking this because they are family. But if OP ever admitted to keeping the money in a text or something, that would be enough evidence for her sister to have the cops charge her with stealing. And 1500 very well might be felony territory.", "I wouldn't say, obviously. She literally did steal the money, and if she admitted to keeping it in a text or something, that would be enough for her sister to go to the cops to have her arrested for stealing. While her sister owed her the money, you don't get to just take what you want back in the real world. Encouraging this behavior could potentially lead to problems for her in the future.", "Yeah, OP is 19, so like, is an understandable AH, but still an AH. This way would have created a scene, but it's better than just taking the money.\n\nThat being said, just stop giving your sister money, and you definitely shouldn't have given her that amount of money. If she needs the money to live, she can ask your parents for it, and if they don't have the money, don't give it to her without them being aware of you lending it, and you knowing what it's for.", "If you lend money to someone, they're obliged to pay it back. She lent it. She did not give it.", "How is it her fault that her sister manipulated her?", "In reality, if I ever lend money I consider it gone. Happy surprise if they actually give it back, but someone who is in need of money isn\u2019t usually going to have the funds to pay back at any time.", "She allowed her sister to manipulate her by not saying no after the very first time she didn\u2019t pay her back. Her sister quickly learned that she was an easy target. And, after not learning that lesson, the first time, she was given the lesson several more times and she still hasn\u2019t learned. She has every right to that Xmas money however, I don\u2019t feel like stealing is a noble move. I probably would have done the same however.", "That sounds like a good way to go, but OP is young and apparently doesn't think that way. That's something you pretty much learn through experience, right? And she doesn't really have that much money. I wouldn't have been able to lend anybody $1500 at the age of 19!"]}
