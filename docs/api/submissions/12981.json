I know the lady who runs the rescue and I know she wants what is best for all of the animals in her care. I told her what I thought and it was decided that she would not be giving them an application. Now, the reason I told her it wasn\u2019t a good idea is because my ex husband doesn\u2019t have a livable wage at his job. His mom pays for his utilities and his college. His wife doesn\u2019t work when she is capable of doing so. They live in a two bedroom house with 5 children (she has 3 kids from a previous marriage, I have a child with my ex husband, and they have a child together). They have gotten cats from local shelters and they always end up putting the cat outside and the cat runs away. They do this because they claim their child is allergic to them. It\u2019s irresponsible, not my business. BUT when I am asked for my opinion I will give it. They will simply not be able to afford vet care. They can\u2019t even afford utilities or dependable vehicles. I didn\u2019t tell her to not let them adopt a puppy out of spite. My ex husband and I get along really well. His wife is okay, we\u2019ve never had words or fought or anything. But I just know that they\u2019ll either kick the dog out or they won\u2019t be able to afford to take it to the vet if something happens because they\u2019re very irresponsible when it comes to finances.
