Let's call them Mae and Bonnie. We were supposed to leave at around 11 AM from the campus but then we were interrupted by a Christmas prayer service the university was conducting. It took over 2 hours and no one was allowed to leave.\n\nSo I normally don't have breakfast and I was really looking forward to lunch. I was hungry at 11 but absolutely famished at 1 PM. So I was a little grouchy but not at anyone in particular. It wasn't my friends' fault there was a sudden change in plans. So I kept how hungry I was to myself.\n\nAfter the prayer service was over, I was up and ready to go. Then a couple of Bonnie's friends came over to talk to her. Mae was also friendly with these girls, so all of them started chatting. These girls didn't even look in my direction even though I waved and said \"hey\". No problem. I didn't really know them all that well, so I didn't really care if they didn't acknowledge me, even if it was objectively rude.\n\nTime passed and 1 PM became 2 PM. By now I was definitely angry and upset. Punctuality and sticking to the agreed upon time is very very important to me because I was raised to respect other people's time. I get very anxious when I keep other people waiting and do my best to make up for it if I'm late. Mae noticed I looked tired and asked if I wanted a banana or something, but made no moves to actually get going for the lunch as planned. I curtly said no, and said we should get going.\n\nThen Bonnie suggested they should all take pictures, and her friends joined her. Then they invited Mae, who asked me to come, but then it was the last straw for me. I called both of them disrespectful and ignorant to someone who has been waiting 4 hours to go have lunch as planned, and I wasn't going to give up anymore of my time for a couple of strangers who didn't even have the courtesy to not treat me like I wasn't even there. Then I stormed out and left. Both of them texted me hours later, Mae is apologetic but Bonnie says I embarrassed her in front of her friends.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: Okay I hear you. I'm gonna text them back and apologise.\n\nEdit: Mae has forgiven me. Bonnie has replied, she is still angry, which I understand, and told her that I don't expect her to forgive me.

I don't see how you couldn't have just taken something from the vending machine or just  go outright and tell them you're going ahead without them without the outburst. You were already offered a snack but you refused it.", "YTA. Use your words. \"Hey, I didn't eat breakfast and I'm starving, bordering on hangry. If you don't want to leave for lunch yet, I gotta go grab a snack. I'll be back in 20.\"", "YTA. You\u2019re not the center of the universe and you acted very immature. Your friends have lives and priorities that might conflict with your own. You were hungry so lunch was on the front of your mind but your friends are not obligated to manage your eating habits. The prayer service was out of everyone\u2019s control so to blame the friends for being late for lunch is a little ridiculous.\n\nIt would be a different story if you were supposed to meet them there and you sat for two hours and they didn\u2019t show, but you were all together already so no one is disrespecting your time. Events occurred while you were in their presence that delayed the lunch and you threw a fit. Learn to communicate.", "YTA, what was stopping you from popping to a shop to grab a snack to tide you over to lunch?  You could have handled this with a bit more maturity and view this as a learning lesson.\nI understand and sympathise you were hungry but there will be many occasions when things do not go according to plan. \nThis was your last day at university so a pretty big occasion? And your friends were wanting to say a proper goodbye to other friends. That seems reasonable, as does taking  photos\u2026.Sometimes things crop up and you need to go with the flow!\n\nA better way this could have been managed was to say \u2018 I\u2019m just going to grab something to tide me over before we get our meal,  you guys catch up and I\u2019ll be back in 10\u2019 \n\nInstead you flounced off and caused a scene on what should have been a happy occasion. \n\nApologise to your mates and hopefully you can all move on", "YTA. You didn't communicate that entire time. You just sat there all upset and exploded. You were super immature. At some point, all you had to do was say you were hungry and hadn't eaten. But, you pouted and exploded.", "YTA. Did you really just stand to the side for over an hour seething about not going to lunch and feeling crap instead of just saying, 'hey I really need to get some food'? There were seriously so many options - you could have said something, gone and got food yourself, or just invited everyone! \n\nAnd how does your school spring a surprise 2 hour prayer meeting on you? That's what I'm more shocked at!", "This makes no sense. None of us could leave from the prayer service. We weren't allowed to. So it was none of our faults. \n\nOn the other hand, they certainly did not need to \"catch up\" for over an hour while ignoring me and not even trying to include me. We decided to go at 11 because we had plans to travel separately tomorrow and needed the evening ( I didnt include this because it seemed irrelevant to what I was trying to say).", "I literally did not blame them for the prayer service and I say so very clearly in my post. I hear what the rest of your reply is saying though.", "The problem is the lack of adult communication. None of this was articulated to them. \u201cHey, I\u2019m starving so I\u2019m gonna go ahead. Text me when you finish up?\u201d instead of the pubescent classic \u2018Brood & Blow Up\u2019 typically yields better results.", "Did they handcuff you to your seat?  Were you walking to lunch and some choir boys tackled you and dragged you by your ankles into a church? How the hell were you forced into a prayer service?", "You could have taken the banana. Or just politely say \"sorry, I'm famished, I'm going to get lunch. Can't wait anymore\"", "They locked the university gates, if you must know.", "Perhaps I should have mentioned that me going ahead in isolation because rarely anyone shows up on time is a common occurance in my life. But I get what you are saying.", "So this whole thing is lie then.  That's a massive firecode violation.  At least make your story believable if you're going to make shit up.", "I'm sorry, what part of what I said in my post was a lie? I'm confused. I already said that we weren't allowed to leave during the service. I did not even say that the service was the main cause for the problem here either.", "There's no campus in any civilized country that would lock their gates to force student into a prayer service.  Do you not have muslim, Jewish, atheist students at your school?  I don't care what the \"main problem\" is when this whole post is a lie.  If you're willing to lie about them locking the gates then I have to assume the whole thing is a lie.", "Okay. If you say so. Apparently I need to control my temper here, if I have to take a hint based on what the other replies are saying, so I'll let you believe what you believe. It won't change the fact that its a very unfortunate common occurance where I live and there's nothing anyone can do about it.", "What kind of university traps you in a two hour prayer service and doesn\u2019t let you leave? Were you physically restrained? Were the doors locked? What would happen if you attempted to leave?", "Sorry, I'm stuck on this bit:\n\n>no one was allowed to leave.\n\n...you're legally adults, they can't keep you there, that's called kidnapping.  If you mean it would have been socially awkward to leave, then yeah, but like.  What?", "NTA and you shouldn\u2019t have to apologize they knew u guys had plans and her offering u a banana shows that u were looking famished", "YTA you should have just spoken out and said \"hey I am really hungry so can we just go have lunch? \" Instead of storming out.", "The locked gates thing is bullshit unless you\u2019re living in some theocratic hellhole. I\u2019ve read this entire thing and the fact you won\u2019t answer the question as to where the uni is but keep reasserting that they forced you to attend a religious ceremony leads me to believe this is completely fabricated", "Might get down voted but personally EHS. If you have plans you stick to them. And if things happen either the host or the party or both should communicate that the changes are okay/not okay. The service was an inevitable change. That's not on anyone. But Bonnie's friends was another thing. Cool say hi and stuff but after 30 minutes I would've reminded Bonnie we have plans. In tht moment it's up to Bonnie to either tell her friends bye or communicate \"Hey I wanna chat for a bit\". But instead what happened was she assume she could have a nice chatter with her friends bc you never communicated that you wanted to leave. And the friends should've been considerate enough to relaize \"oh she's not alone\". This is also where Bonnie and/or Mae should've also acknowledged oh were on someone else's planned time. You're lack of communication favored Bonnie and Mae as they were able to lose track of time without considering the plans already made. But at the same time either one should've also told those girls \"Hey it was nice seeing you but we have plans we gotta get going now\". Or at least said \"hey OP I know you're hungry and wanna leave but are you okay with...\" Bonnie should feel embarrassed. She disrespected you and your time. And idk why but that \"do you want something to eat\" comment would've made me quietly walk out and go low contact with her bc that was degrading. Especially saying that when you know your plans were to go out and eat anyways.", "ESH. \n\nYou absolutely should have communicated, but I find it strange so many people here would be fine with not eating anything until post 2pm when you had brunch plans. They shouldn\u2019t have kept dilly dallying, and you needed to be upfront with the fact you were hungry and wanted to leave.", "YTA- You sound like you expect the world to revolve around you. Then when it doesn\u2019t go to your personal plan you throw a bit of a tantrum and become uncooperative. If lunch was such a huge deal to you then you could have kept politely reminding them that you wanted to eat. Plus it doesn\u2019t sound like this prayer service was mandatory. If I was that desperate to eat I would have skipped the service and went somewhere on my own for a snack at least.", "YTA - I used to be like you and didn\u2019t say how I felt in the moment, I\u2019ve grown out of it and life is a lot easier. You really need to communicate your feelings and not get mad at people for not being on the same page as your needs. Communicate your needs and you\u2019re going to lose friends once they get tired of your behaviour", "YTA but I\u2019m sympathetic. I\u2019ve done something similar. It\u2019s like you get so focused on not freaking out about being hungry that you can\u2019t even think to tell anyone you\u2019re hungry\u2014and then you freak out.", "Ummm NTA! you should not have yelled but hangry people yell! Cant your friends forgive and move on? Its a simple tiny fight! Big deal! Mae seems nice but bonnie seems like an A\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You maybe should have spoken up earlier.\n\nHowever.... your friends knew you were waiting for lunch....\n\nIt's like they don't care about you at all.\n\nIf you feel like you owe them an apology, fine.\n\nBut, IMHO, they owe you a bigger one.\n\nI'm going with NTA.  (You got hangry, and they didn't care about you at all.)", "NTA I fucking hate when people do the whole dance with strangers when we are supposed to be somewhere else. Especially if you were delayed by 3 hours. Even if you ate breakfast, after 3 hours anyone would be hungry. And they igbored you. Also, why were they chatting for so long? They go to the same University, they can literally see each other any time of the day.", "YTA - but not too bad. Both my wife and daughter get uncontrollably hungry if they don't eat at on the regular. It's a form of hypoglycemia. Took my wife a while to get it all regulated so she has no issues now keeping level.  \n\nMy daughter - we have to help her understand she has to have a small snack or some breakfast or whatever when she starts feeling out of control. She can't leave the house and go drive without a bite of something. It's just how her body works.  \n\nI'd be hungry AF if this happened to me. But your countenance and hangriness is 100% your responsibility. Get some snacks in your backpack for times like this yeah, they were rude but it's not your responsibility they decided to get chatty.  \n\nTook My wife a while to get this into her head. It was honestly frustrating for me as I could see all she needed was a little snacky!  \n\nSounds like you get it, which is a sign you're a good person. Get a hungry snack pack in your backpack and use it to regulate. I get hungry. Most of us do. But some of us go from hungry to unable to be a good human quick. Sounds like that's you.", "Ok ok, I see the comments, but NTA. You were hangry. Honestly, I probably would have done something similar \ud83d\ude02", "YTA.\n\n>  So I kept how hungry I was to myself.\n\nGrow up and learn to use your adult voice. \n\n> It wasn't my friends' fault there was a sudden change in plans.\n\nWhy are you trying to cast it in terms of 'fault?'\n\nYeah, plans changed.  You can still point out that you're hungry, and that if they want to hold off on eating, you'll go ahead.\n\nGuess what?  You're an autonomous human being, with agency, free will, a voice, and the ability to see to your own needs without having group consensus.", "YTA, if you were that hungry you should have used your words and not even gone to a parayer service. \"No one's allowed to leave.\" Wtf, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard", "Some universities will do things like this.\n\nA friend went to Pepperdine University (in Malibu, CA) and they try to force all undergraduates to attend University church services.\n\nAdministration would go so far to threaten the scholarships/grants most students get as part of the incentive  to attend services.\n\nThat backfired with a foreign student from a wealthy background who told admin to screw off as his family was paying for his degree and expenses.", "Yeah the doors were locked. They'd just tell us to wait till it's over.", "if ESH then why am i the only one being reprimanded? pls change it to YTA at least.", "I have already accepted that I'm the asshole. I've made up with one of my friends. The other hasn't responded yet but I understand because I was in the wrong here, a 100%. None of this forces or obliges me to reveal where my private, personal location is. You can say that my university is horrible without demanding for personal info that I have not consented to share.\n\nI have not even declared that the service is the leading cause here. It may have been a catalyst but it was far from the actual cause. I would have been okay with going ahead after 2 hours if I didn't feel slighted and ignored by my friends, which I should have communicated instead of keeping it to myself.\n\nSo my point is: you are not within your rights to demand my location. I'm not an AITA veteran but I'm pretty sure that's against the rules here.", "Nobody forced her not to eat a banana or something for breakfast.  Also this whole post is a lie, theres no civilized campus that would falsely imprison their students by locking them inside and forcing them to pray.  Massive human rights violation.

If some random person asked for your opinion on an interaction they had and they said.   \"My friends and I had plans for lunch but then we were kidnapped and falsely imprisoned against our will and I snapped on them for wasting time taking photos after our abductors released us, aita for snapping?\"   ..... would you not respond; why did you not call the authorities?  Why did you not try to escape?  Why did you not try to kill the people imprisoning you?  This would be on the news if it were real and realistically if you were being held against your will why did you not call 911 at the very least?", "I kinda don\u2019t believe the school locks you up. I could be wrong if you\u2019re in a country with less freedoms, but what you\u2019re describing is false imprisonment and the school can be looking at a massive lawsuit and be shut down. It\u2019s illegal (in most countries) to lock people up in a room against their will and if that is really what\u2019s happening at your school then you have much more terrifying problems on your hands than lunch.", "Then I remove that point and downgrade you to kind of the a hole. You need to be more clear with your friends if lunch was such a major concern for you. It sounds like the one girl read your mind and tried to offer a snack as a kind of compromise to hold you over. The point stands though that when in a group one person doesn\u2019t decide what everyone else is going to do. Those decisions tend to be majority rule. Personally I would be making an issue of the mandatory prayer service. Especially one that goes on for multiple hours and you\u2019re locked in.", "WHY DID YOU NOT CALL THE POLICE?", "But not once did you actually tell them your issue. They can't read your mind. They just got caught up in the moment. You really do need to communicate if you have an issue. If they weren't ready to go at the end of the service, you should have explained the situation and left.", "lolololoollolol", "Yes. It is a Catholic institution (its students aren't restricted to only Catholics though, everyone regardless of religion is here but they are unfairly strict about attending uni events like this)", "Yes I did, I told her I should have told them I was really hungry and really wanted to leave, but I didn't because I was angry but also didn't want to cause a scene (until I actually did), and she told me she shouldn't have hung around for over an hour after we were free to go. (Idk if I should accept the apology bc now it just seems like she doesn't need to give me one). Bonnie hasn't texted me back.", "Or OP's country's equivalent of 911.", ">I kinda don\u2019t believe the school locks you up. \n\nNever attended a catholic institution I guess.", "You can't just lock in a bunch of adults in a room. I call bs on this.", "You were also free to go get food for yourself. I really don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t just say ( when the girls arrived) \u201c hey, did you guys still want to go to lunch? I\u2019m starving so if not/you guys are all trying to hang I\u2019m going to go by myself\u201d. \n\nThen you made your needs known and all adults can make their own choices about what they want to do. I know you\u2019re young so I\u2019m not gonna hold it against you, but plans change. People bail. Sure it\u2019s rude sometimes if it\u2019s for like a birthday or an occasion, but at the end of the day people are going to do what they want/what\u2019s best for them. \nYou should do the same. \n\nSitting there seething and waiting for someone to check in on you is\u2026..not a good look. Neither way blowing up at them. Good on you for apologizing, but you got to lean to speak up. And not in a \u201c my way needs to happen now\u201d kinda way, in a \u201c I\u2019m stating my needs ( calmly) and you guys are free to join me in my plans\u201d. \n\nAlso, next time you get angry, it\u2019s best to just remove yourself from the situation.", "You can't do that to adults. As you are no longer a minor, the school is no longer your guardians.", "you've clearly never been in a catholic instituition in a conservative country i guess", "I guess I should have made it clear, because my hunger took precedence at the time I couldn't, but the reason for this outing was not to primarily stuff my face. It was also to be with my friends. I don't understand the suggestions of \"just go away by yourself like a loser loner and gobble up food\". If I wanted to eat by myself why would I just stay there and wait? I would not even have made plans if lunch was the most important thing. It may have been at the time but overall I just wanted to be with my friends. I get it. I was mean to them. But I don't know what walking into a restaurant all alone without ppl who bailed on me would solve except make me bottle things up more and scream at them much later when this would have been a non-issue", "I know, but they do this quite often unfortunately. Everyone is supposed to attend if they are hosting some sort of mandatory public event. But either way, that's really not the issue here.", "I was raised very, very Catholic. This is absolutely bullshit, even if you keep doubling down. What country would that even be?", "But you also had the option to get a snack to take the edge off until you could all eat together\u2026", "You didn't really make anything clear in your post. You say you were starving, yet here you say you didn't want to eat alone like a \"loser loner\" (which is pretty f****** rude to someone who suggesting that to you in good faith). Yet you were offered a banana to eat while you were with your friends, the solving the issue of hunger and being with your friends, but you didn't want that either. Seems like the real issue is that you didn't want the attention divided between you and the rest of Mae's friends, and you didn't want any flexibility in your plans.\n\nAnd eating alone at a restaurant wouldn't \"make you bottle things up more and explode later\". That would be a choice that you made. You could have just communicated. You could have gone with the flow, ate a banana, hung out in a large group, and then had lunch later with the smaller group. You also could have pulled Mae aside and said \"Hey I was really excited for our lunch today, do you know when we can go do that?\". You could have said to the entire group \"Hey I'm really hungry and we were planning to go to this one restaurant, do you guys want to come? We can head over there.\" No one makes you bottle things up and explode instead of communicating, that's something you're doing to yourself. In the future, if you make more open, good-faith communication attempts early, then you can avoid having to make more text apologies later. \n\nBut as you said, Mae forgave you, so all's well. Just a learning experience for next time.", "Look, you\u2019re uncomfortable eating in a restaurant by yourself and wanted to go with friends- that\u2019s fine. Also there is nothing wrong with going to a restaurant by yourself. It definitely doesn\u2019t make you a \u201c loner loser gobbling up food by yourself\u201d lol. Trust me, I\u2019m a bartender at an upscale restaurant and PLENTY of people eat by themselves. You sound really immature. \n\nWhat you don\u2019t seem to be grasping is : you were hungry yet wanted to go with your friends, yet NEVER said anything. I was 100% your choice to stay and continue to get more upset. Had you stated you were hungry, then your friends would have had the choice of going with you- or telling you they were not ready. In which case you would have had to choose to stay and wait ( again your CHOICE, just like staying and seething was), or take care of your own needs like an adult. \n\nHonestly if I were your friends ( especially if we didn\u2019t know each other well) your display would be a massive turn off and just show me that your incapable of communicating even the simplest things like \u201c I\u2019m hungry\u201d. It is no one else\u2019s responsibility to monitor and take care of what you want/need. Best of luck!", "You can kill someone legally in self defense for false imprisonment.

Had you acted as a responsible adult you would have just left and got your own food. Accepting this weird school indoctrination is your own fault. Don't blame others.", "I agree with almost everything you said here. Yes I didn't make everything clear, yes I wanted to be with my friends. Yes, I was upset that attention was being divided. Yes I should have talked to Mae instead of exploding at her. I think we've made that clear.\n\nBut if you'll notice in what I said in my post, I also said that Mae and Bonnie's friends were ignoring me, not even saying Hi back when I said Hi to them. Didn't invite me to talk. Didn't invite me to take pictures. My friends didn't even bother introducing me to them either, or even including me in the conversation. So why should I want to hang out with people who looked at me like I was invisible? (Not talking about Mae or Bonnie, I'm talking about their friends).\n\nOh wait. Should I have used my words again? Should I have shouted \"hello???? I said Hi!!! Why aren't you saying Hi back??? Why are you ignoring me???\" and made a scene? What would you have done in my position if someone look right past you like you were made of transparent glass? Oh no. Am I being presumptuous for asking to be greeted back like a normal human being? For feeling thought of and considered by my friends? Am I?", "Exactly. This is a ridiculously obviously made up story.", "I literally am not blaming my friends for the school indoctrination!!! How many times do I need to make myself clear about that????", "What would I have done? I would have done and what I told you in my original response. I would have taken Mae aside and told her I was excited for lunch can we go? Or I would have gone and eaten at a restaurant alone because I'm fine with that. (You're the one who thinks it's a \"loner loser\" activity. The rest of us, who are suggesting that in good faith cuz it's something we like to do, don't think that way. Again, rude) I certainly wouldn't have given so much power, during and after the situation, to people who could be bothered to say hi to me back.", "Like. All of you here are calling me the instigator of this situation. Why are none of you pausing to consider how much I was being ignored by them (which I have mentioned in the post), even if you take out the fact that they didn't know I was starving? I didn't just explode out of nowhere you know. Nearly an HOUR's worth of being excluded went into this. Mae was the only one who even looked in my direction for more than a minute. Is that presumptuous?", "So where you live they lock people up to pray? Some students work, some students have chemo, some students have dental appointments, some students have children, some students have ailing parents they need to check up on, some students aren't into worshiping cloud daddies.   No campus would lock their gates to force you to pray.   Listen to your mother \"you don't have to do things you don't want to do\".   You could have just told your friends NO I don't belive in a homophobic cloud daddy and left,  you could have told you friends I'm hungry and haven't eaten all day and not taken pictures or left to go visit a vending machine.  Instead you blew up and your friends just like you did your mother and lied about your campus gates.", "They were the only ones you blew up at.\n\nYou could have gotten a snack for breakfast at 11 and met them at lunchtime.", "But you weren't in my position. You weren't feeling what I felt. I didn't suggest that the act of eating alone would make anyone a loner. I said that if I, ME, did that, I would feel that way. Because I, god forbid, wanted to be with friends on a pre-planned outing.", "And if I left by myself, I just know for a fact that I would have gotten piled upon for leaving them behind even though I waited more than an hour for them. Like god. Everyone here is complaining and accusing me of lying about a prayer service than considering the instigating incidents that happened before my outburst. The only reason I even mentioned that service is to highlight just how long the plans had been delayed. That is all.", "I have not called you presumptuous for anything and I'm not sure who you're responding to that has.\n\nEdit: I also didn't accuse you of faking the service. I'm not every commenter on this thread, you know."]}
