Let's call them Mae and Bonnie. We were supposed to leave at around 11 AM from the campus but then we were interrupted by a Christmas prayer service the university was conducting. It took over 2 hours and no one was allowed to leave. \n\nSo I normally don't have breakfast and I was really looking forward to lunch. I was hungry at 11 but absolutely famished at 1 PM. So I was a little grouchy but not at anyone in particular. It wasn't my friends' fault there was a sudden change in plans. So I kept how hungry I was to myself. \n\nAfter the prayer service was over, I was up and ready to go. Then a couple of Bonnie's friends came over to talk to her. Mae was also friendly with these girls, so all of them started chatting. These girls didn't even look in my direction even though I waved and said \"hey\". No problem. I didn't really know them all that well, so I didn't really care if they didn't acknowledge me, even if it was objectively rude. \n\nTime passed and 1 PM became 2 PM. By now I was definitely angry and upset. Punctuality and sticking to the agreed upon time is very very important to me because I was raised to respect other people's time. I get very anxious when I keep other people waiting and do my best to make up for it if I'm late. Mae noticed I looked tired and asked if I wanted a banana or something, but made no moves to actually get going for the lunch as planned. I curtly said no, and said we should get going. \n\nThen Bonnie suggested they should all take pictures, and her friends joined her. Then they invited Mae, who asked me to come, but then it was the last straw for me. I called both of them disrespectful and ignorant to someone who has been waiting 4 hours to go have lunch as planned, and I wasn't going to give up anymore of my time for a couple of strangers who didn't even have the courtesy to not treat me like I wasn't even there. Then I stormed out and left. Both of them texted me hours later, Mae is apologetic but Bonnie says I embarrassed her in front of her friends. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1702123781, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ecawr/aita_for_storming_away_from_a_gettogether_with/", "score": 8, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What stopped you from leaving to get a snack and coming back?", "YTA. They were being disrespectful but you shouldn't have expected them to read your mind. Communicate goddammit! Your fault lies in yelling at them instead of just telling them and going off on your own.", "YTA.

Low blood sugar is no joke.\n\nAt 1 pm when the service was over, you would have needed to CLEARLY say \"I am absolutely starving and want to leave for lunch right now.\" If they then indicated that they didn't want to go yet, it was up to you to decide if you wanted to wait for them or leave. Instead, you hung around while they socialized unaware that you were getting more and more annoyed. So your blowup was a shock to them because you hadn't clearly communicated.", "YTA. Saying that punctuality & sticking to the agreed upon time is important to you makes no sense in this context. You were already derailed by (voluntarily) attending a 2 hour prayer service. Sounds like you had casual lunch plans with no set time. If it was ok for you to attend a 2 hour prayer service, why was it not ok for your friends to have a chat & take pics with friends on the last day of uni? Delays are only ok if you say so?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I don't see how you couldn't have just taken something from the vending machine or just  go outright and tell them you're going ahead without them without the outburst. You were already offered a snack but you refused it.", "YTA. Use your words. \"Hey, I didn't eat breakfast and I'm starving, bordering on hangry. If you don't want to leave for lunch yet, I gotta go grab a snack. I'll be back in 20.\"", "YTA. You\u2019re not the center of the universe and you acted very immature. Your friends have lives and priorities that might conflict with your own. You were hungry so lunch was on the front of your mind but your friends are not obligated to manage your eating habits. The prayer service was out of everyone\u2019s control so to blame the friends for being late for lunch is a little ridiculous.\n\nIt would be a different story if you were supposed to meet them there and you sat for two hours and they didn\u2019t show, but you were all together already so no one is disrespecting your time. Events occurred while you were in their presence that delayed the lunch and you threw a fit. Learn to communicate.", "YTA, what was stopping you from popping to a shop to grab a snack to tide you over to lunch?  You could have handled this with a bit more maturity and view this as a learning lesson.\nI understand and sympathise you were hungry but there will be many occasions when things do not go according to plan. \nThis was your last day at university so a pretty big occasion? And your friends were wanting to say a proper goodbye to other friends. That seems reasonable, as does taking  photos\u2026.Sometimes things crop up and you need to go with the flow!\n\nA better way this could have been managed was to say \u2018 I\u2019m just going to grab something to tide me over before we get our meal,  you guys catch up and I\u2019ll be back in 10\u2019 \n\nInstead you flounced off and caused a scene on what should have been a happy occasion. \n\nApologise to your mates and hopefully you can all move on", "YTA. You didn't communicate that entire time. You just sat there all upset and exploded. You were super immature. At some point, all you had to do was say you were hungry and hadn't eaten. But, you pouted and exploded.", "YTA. Did you really just stand to the side for over an hour seething about not going to lunch and feeling crap instead of just saying, 'hey I really need to get some food'? There were seriously so many options - you could have said something, gone and got food yourself, or just invited everyone! \n\nAnd how does your school spring a surprise 2 hour prayer meeting on you? That's what I'm more shocked at!", "This makes no sense. None of us could leave from the prayer service. We weren't allowed to. So it was none of our faults. \n\nOn the other hand, they certainly did not need to \"catch up\" for over an hour while ignoring me and not even trying to include me. We decided to go at 11 because we had plans to travel separately tomorrow and needed the evening ( I didnt include this because it seemed irrelevant to what I was trying to say).", "I literally did not blame them for the prayer service and I say so very clearly in my post. I hear what the rest of your reply is saying though.", "The problem is the lack of adult communication. None of this was articulated to them. \u201cHey, I\u2019m starving so I\u2019m gonna go ahead. Text me when you finish up?\u201d instead of the pubescent classic \u2018Brood & Blow Up\u2019 typically yields better results.", "Did they handcuff you to your seat?  Were you walking to lunch and some choir boys tackled you and dragged you by your ankles into a church? How the hell were you forced into a prayer service?", "You could have taken the banana. Or just politely say \"sorry, I'm famished, I'm going to get lunch. Can't wait anymore\"", "They locked the university gates, if you must know.", "Perhaps I should have mentioned that me going ahead in isolation because rarely anyone shows up on time is a common occurance in my life. But I get what you are saying.", "So this whole thing is lie then.  That's a massive firecode violation.  At least make your story believable if you're going to make shit up.", "I'm sorry, what part of what I said in my post was a lie? I'm confused. I already said that we weren't allowed to leave during the service. I did not even say that the service was the main cause for the problem here either.", "There's no campus in any civilized country that would lock their gates to force student into a prayer service.  Do you not have muslim, Jewish, atheist students at your school?  I don't care what the \"main problem\" is when this whole post is a lie.  If you're willing to lie about them locking the gates then I have to assume the whole thing is a lie.", "Okay. If you say so. Apparently I need to control my temper here, if I have to take a hint based on what the other replies are saying, so I'll let you believe what you believe. It won't change the fact that its a very unfortunate common occurance where I live and there's nothing anyone can do about it."]}
