OP didn't do anything other than explaining that a lot of autistic children grow up to lead perfectly \"normal\" adult life's and can totally take care of themselves. And mentioned that they are autistic.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with that. At all.", "That not how autism or genetics work my guy", "Citation needed on every word in your sentence except \"autism is genetic\".", "As an autistic person, this is one of the strangest takes I have ever seen in autism.\n\nLike, I'm not even a genealogist or anything and even I know that's not how any of this works.", "I know it's blue for a boy and pink for a girl, but what colour is the cake for an autism reveal?", "its like they expected her to reveal it the same way she would a terminal cancer diagnosis lmao", "I mean, my diagnosis was pretty life-altering, but yes, purely in the sense of now having new perspective and understanding, and an ability to care and advocate for myself where previously all I could do was blame and hate myself.", "Getting diagnosed literally decreases risk of suicide, how is that not life altering", "[deleted]", "Yeah that\u2019s just ridiculous. Like, it is genetic, and it can vary, but mutation makes it sound like a virus. I\u2019m 19, working on getting my own answers regarding ADHD, and it runs in my family on both sides (skipping generations on moms, my grandmother has it she\u2019s just too old and there isn\u2019t a point in seeking a diagnosis, and the family rumor is my dad had it as a kid, but he showed no symptoms as an adult, though it would make sense considering I\u2019d heard stories from when he was a kid and have no idea whether he was diagnosed as a kid or not because my family is well known for being snobby my dads family and would never admit would have ADHD) and I just yesterday after I got home for break from college, I did laundry. I then left them in the place I fold them in until this morning. I then proceeded to have breakfast, and leave them there all day while watching Game of Thrones, and they were right in front of me on the couch in the opposite side of the room. Totally forgot they were there for like 18 hours until my mother said something when she got home from her work. It\u2019s an ordeal. But it\u2019s the same type of thing this guy said. ADHD is genetic and can vary from person to person, but it doesn\u2019t \u201cmutate\u201d and autism is genetic and can vary from person to person, but it doesn\u2019t \u201cmutate.\u201d This is not the X-Men dammit", "Ultraviolet or infrared", "No one is offended and no one is being a warrior.\n\nYou made a statement, I responded. Seems like you are offended at being told you are wrong and either didn't read well or need to work on your reading comprehension.\n\nHave the night you deserve!", "[deleted]", "Messaging me because \"we're not done yet\"?\n\nGet a life bro."]}
