Clearly not.\u201d Then went on about how even the few autistic adults who don\u2019t need round-the-clock care can\u2019t hold \u201cnormal\u201d jobs and could never support themselves.\n\nEveryone with autism is different, but Sara and her family have always raved about me and expressed extreme support for me and bf\u2019s relationship.

They're not extremely pissed at you, there's no feelings involved, they're just doing mean-girl tactics to try to get rid of you.", "OMG, NTA. I'm autistic and I don't schedule giant meetings to announce this information. If it comes up in conversation, it comes up in conversation. These people are ableist as hell.", "Nta. They could've used that as an opportunity address their ignorance and gotten a ton of reassurance from an autistic adult who's able to have a good life. But no, they're pissed about being wrong.", "Lol, NTA, you\u2019re allowed to disclose information about yourself however/wherever you want to. \n\nIt made them uncomfortable bc they realized they were being ignorant and offensive.", "Lmao if you\u2019re gonna flaunt the fact that you\u2019re uneducated about something, you gotta prepare to be schooled every now and then. NTA", "NTA. It's not your fault they are ignorant. I'm glad your guy is backing you up. I've got some experience on his side of things. Though my family was completely understanding, we've dealt with others who weren't so much.\n\nMy wife is 52 and was diagnosed on the spectrum a couple of years ago. She has her quirks, and honestly, she sees the world a bit differently than I do. But that's one of the things I love about her. She gives me a different perspective on things.

Is the rest of his family saying the stuff about your ruining their night directly to you, or via BF? I just think perhaps your BF is not as much on your side as you think, if he\u2019s not running major interference. Put it all on him. Don\u2019t interact with his family, certainly, unless he\u2019s there actively/vociferously shutting down the criticism, and make sure he knows you have full expectations he will step up.", "NTA, the timing was perfect", "NTA. They were making it all about them. After all you are the only one in that family who has autism so far, and so far as we know. I also find it strange to be speculating about whether an unborn child will have autism or not. There is no point to that whatsoever.", "NTA. That was foot placed firmly in mouth moment for your BF's fam, i'm sure they're embarrassed. It also sounds like they've bought into the stigma, but don't really understand it. It's honestly not as big a deal as they seem to think.", "NTA\n\nTheir misunderstanding and lack of education on ASD is not your fault. Hopefully this will make some of them educate themselves on it.

Who you disclose that information to and when is entirely up to you.\n\nSara and the family are just embarrassed by their own ignorance. You can only hope they take this as a chance to educate themselves.", "NTA. You need to think about associating with these people regularly. They sound ignorant and awful.", "NTA but they sound like they are AHs. They shouldn't make generalizations about every single individual with Autism. That is discrimination.", "NTA Good on you for being secure enough to share that information to a bunch of close minded ableists.

I\u2019m a 31F awaiting an autism assessment. I\u2019ve worried more about the social aspect of a diagnosis than how having one would actually reframe my own life. I met my biological dad last year and had a huge realization - at any rate, autism is a spectrum. There is no single definition that can fit everyone and many of the characteristics are actually special. There\u2019s positive aspects, it\u2019s important that people see the diversity of the individual.", "NTA.
