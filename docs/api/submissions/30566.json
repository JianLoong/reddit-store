Your brother did not betray anyone. He applied for a job. He got the job. He would have been an idiot if he mentioned your husband.  Did he deny knowing your husband or just not bring it up?  Either way, your husband is not Jesus, and your brother is not Peter. \n\nYou seem to think your brother should have declared his allegiance to your husband and stood in solidarity; he and your husband against the \"man!\" How would that have helped anyone?  All it would have done is stroked your sad little egos.\n\nHis job decisions have nothing to do with you. Grow up and leave your brother alone.\n\nYour husband should talk to a therapist or counselor to better understand his role in his current situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What is your husband being bullied for? Why would your brother knowing him hurt his chances of being hired?", "Ya that was a crappy thing for him to say to you. Seems unnecessary for him to just tell you he pretended to not know your husband, with no prompting. It\u2019s ok to be hurt and upset about that.", "I understand being upset he denied knowing your husband, but I don't see the big deal in him getting a job at the same company. Though maybe he claimed he didn't know your husband because he was afraid they wouldn't hire family members.\n\nEta people don't just randomly change jobs so it feels like information is missing. And I'm not sure how the bullying and transfer have anything to do with the brother.", "NTA, your brother is a man without a moral backbone. If he felt that getting this job was worth denying the relationship with your husband and you than maybe you should grant his wish and tell him off.", "Info: do you think it\u2019s a coincidence that your brother took your husband\u2019a old job?", "NTA to be hurt based on what you know. But maybe you can talk it out? There could be more going on than you realized.", "Info: your \"story\" (being generous) feels like it's missing lots of info. Why are you attributing your brothers employment move to malice?\n\nYou seem to be implying your brother knows or maybe is partially responsible for the \"bullying\"?", "I N F O: If there was zero benefit for your brother to change jobs, why did he do it? Did you ask him?\n\nEdited after OP answered: NTA. The very least thing he could have done would be talking to you two beforehand and explaining the situation. But he didn't even bother to do that.", "Nope.  He has given me very little info.  Questions were blown off.", "I don\u2019t know if he was asked or why he would be asked . All he told me was that he pretend not to know husband.  We do t know why my husband was being bullied - that\u2019s what bullies do.  My brother knew my husband was bullied, for years.  He assumed that knowing my husband would hurt his chances.  You\u2019d have to ask him why.", "Again, I was not upset about change of jobs - not my business .  I don\u2019t care that they would work at same company.  My ONLY concern is will the \u201cshame\u201d of knowing my husband.", "Wasn\u2019t the same exact job.  The job is not my concern.  The Judas move is.", "The employment move is NOT the issue.  The denial of knowing his brother in law is what hurt me.  I think this denial does actually perpetuate the bullying .", "He was CONSIDERING moving to the city where employer was located.  He would save about 10 minutes driving time.  This was his reason.  He never actually moved.", "In another comment you said he wanted to move to that company because he was considering moving to that city.", "So he didn't mention him, that doesn't mean he pretended to not know him. If he wasn't asked about your husband, why would he just say, \"oh yeah, that dude you all hate for unknown reasons, even though we're all grown-ups? I don't know him!\" I'm sorry, something has to be missing here.", "Really? It's not? Because you go on and on about how there was ostensibly no reason for him to make that move. \n\nSo whats the real reason? \n\nAnd I'm hesitant to call you an asshole for it, but why would your brother mention your husband if he KNEW your husband wasn't well liked at his place of employment?", "Correct, but no real reason why.  He might save 10 minutes of driving?  He never did move.", "Not what I said\u2026my brother told me \u201cI pretended not to know\u201d husband.  That\u2019s all I got.  I don\u2019t know if my husbands name came up, or why it would come up.  \u201cGrown ups\u201d is not how I would describe the bully.", "I honestly don\u2019t care about the job.  I am concerned with the fact that brother denied husband  for no good reason.", "Saving some time driving would be a reason, though.", "You keep saying no good reason. \n\nI don't see it that way. Your husband is not well liked and is bullied. Why would your brother want to bring up that connection? \n\nIt almost certainly wouldn't help your husband, and would definitely hurt your brother. \n\nHe's a selfish asshole for not mentioning the connection but you can't say \"for no reason\u201d. The reason is obvious. \n\nEither way you\u2019re NTA for being hurt, but you are naive for not acknowledging why, and you should be questioning why your brother wanted that job.", "Bud she didn't say NO reason she said no GOOD reason. As in she doesn't feel that avoiding the negative association with her husband was a good enough reason to pretend not to know him.", "Not trying to argue with you\u2026but what am I naive about?  It\u2019s obvious my brother denied my husband because he thought it would hurt his chances of getting the job.  I agree my brother has not been 100% open and honest with me.  I can\u2019t answer some of the questions people are asking me , because my brother has not given me info.  I just want to know if I am wrong to be hurt by my bother\u2019s Judas move .", "No. I think it\u2019s fair to be hurt, I just think you should be asking more questions here.", "Tried\u2026was blown off.", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Yep"]}
