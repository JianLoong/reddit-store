So that\u2019s a big word to throw around. To recap:\n\n1. Your husband was being bullied at work and was transferred against his will. Now, I have a hard time believing there are no underlying factors AND you husband had no recourse for the \u201cbullying\u201d. In your post you never say why you husband was having  issues in his job. Why did this person suddenly start to single out your husband.\n\n2. Your brother applied for a job at the same company because he wanted to change jobs. You say he didn\u2019t receive any type of benefit, but maybe he just wanted a change. they may make a lateral move (I move to a job of similar pay / title). The benefits don\u2019t have to known to you \n\n3. Based on your own responses, you have no clue why your husbands name would even come up during your brothers interview. Which my guess is, it likely didn\u2019t. HOWEVER, I would not list a person who\u2019s not currently excelling at the company as a reference.\n\n4. You claim you have no issue with him getting a job there just not proclaiming that he knows your husband, but I\u2019m looking for a REASONABLE explanation as to why he would even need to mention your husband?\n\nOverall, YTA. While your husband is not doing well at his current company, that has not to do with your brother and it\u2019s not on your brother to take up some \u201cfight\u201d that he has no knowledge of and \u201cno dog in the fight\u201d. You are rightfully distressed for your husband,  but maybe it\u2019s time for your husband to find another job.", "Recruiter here - Not sure why your husband would come up in an interview process, so not sure why you're upset. \n\nI don't think they asked him if he knew your husband given they have different surnames.

You are making this small non event into a mountain. Why is there such shame, hurt and anger over someone who isn't you? There are plenty of employers that may prefer to hire someone their employees know, and plenty others who don't want to get caught showing favoritism to new hires because they know someone. The situation has literally nothing to do with you, and you're taking on so much emotional labor that it's concerning. \n\nYou said it right here -\n\n>Brother applied for job and pretended not to know my husband because he thought it would hurt his chances of getting the job\n\nEmployers don't want drama.

Some of the best advice I've ever gotten was to stop taking things so personally and stop making everything about me. That would probably help you greatly in this situation.", "YTA- Why would you be hurt? Your husband was a negative element to getting hired. Any grown up knows this. You don't know his motivation, but you attribute to him the worst motivations.  He can change jobs for any reason and he doesn't need your approval. You're butt hurt over nothing.", "You seem so extreme, why are you calling your brother a Judas over this? Why is any of it your business?

Why are you so invested in something that really has nothing to do with you or your husband? Be happy for your brother and move on.", "Yta. he didn't start the job and then start denying knowledge, he interviewed and probably wanted the job based on merit not by who he knows.

Bullying is by no means a good thing and should not be happening no matter what age you are but I feel like a lot of info is being left out. As to what he did or didn't do to warrant the bullying. Also, for your brother situation, I feel like he did nothing wrong. It's a little strange that he would switch job knowing the pay isn't any better, but it was his choice to applied, interview, and accepted the job.

OP legitimately believes that her brother went to all this trouble of switching jobs, just to hurt her feelings. This, despite claiming to know that her brother and her husband are good friends who get along well. Why would your brother do this, OP? The simple explanation is likely right - he didn't do anything to hurt you, he was just trying to get a job, and knew that there had been some drama around your husband lately, so he thought maybe mentioning the connection wouldn't help him in the interview process.\n\nStop reading insult into things that don't even have anything to do with you!\n\nIf your brother and your husband are friends, then be happy that is the case and don't worry about what your brother is doing at work.", "INFO - what did you expect? He isn't interviewing based on knowing your husband. He's interviewing on his own merits. Your husband should never have come up in the interview. Did you expect your brother to bring him up?

Mind your side of the street, not his.", "INFO: Your husband being bullied, and then having HIM get transferred, doesn't really pass the smell test to me. Against his wishes is also another interesting facet of the whole thing.

Very wise even.", "YTA.  Betrayal?  What betrayal exactly?  Why does any of this matter?  Apology?", "i don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough info tbh. what was your husband bullied about? did you brother hate his old job? could it be there are better benefits with your husband\u2019s company? does this company hire their employees\u2019 family members? i don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for being upset, but i also don\u2019t think your brother is an AH for getting the job, unless there\u2019s more information you find later on.\n\nNAH. i get both sides, but i don\u2019t think you should make a mountain out of a mole hill. if you need space from your brother, take it, but don\u2019t let yourself get too caught up in what ifs and thinking the worst, it\u2019s not worth your energy", "INFO: How does your husband feel about your brother having his old job?

He wants to tell you and your husband this way he agrees with the bullying and how the company handled it so much, he even wants to work there and be around these people for a significant part of his every day life.\n\nI would understand it if the pay or benefits are better and he needs it, but from what you write, the only reason i can see why he applied there is bc the way they treated your husband made your brother some kind of fanboy and he really really wanted to become part of the group who used to bully his \"friend\". So it seems like for some reason your brother really dislikes your husband and this is his way of telling you this. I'm surprised you only want an apology. I don't know if i could ever trust him again tbh. \n\nBut the story does sound strange. Are you really sure there is no, really no good reason for your brother to take a job there?", "NTA.

They usually only transfer the abused if it benefits them. You can't punish the victim.", "It's because she is the bully!", "lol yeah, and it sounds like the brother knows the bullying was probably BS, which is why he jumped on the opportunity so quickly", "And if he answered \"no\" on the application or during an HR screening, that would be grounds for dismissal for lying. So it's very odd that the brother would take the chance in lying about this. Unless the BIL is absolutely sure he'll never cross paths with the husband or someone who knows the connection -- and that's a really big to stake \"I'll take my chances on\" -- there's something else going on ... what that is, I can't even hazard a guess but it's so odd.", "I'd assume it IS a better place to work and the BIL knows why O.P's husband isn't liked.", "If someone was demanding an apology for a job move, calling them Judas and they somehow betrayed you and saying their reasons aren't good enough then you're not exactly the type of person who is safe to have an open and honest dialogue with. Your brother applied for a job and since he knew your husband's drama (which for him to be forcibly transferred after stellar performance and not the other person, he's not exactly innocent and being honest with you about what happened)  he didn't want your husband to poison his career and have target on his back he denied knowing him.", "Yeah, I have also worked at places with referral bonuses (these were always jobs with high turnover), so I've seen both extremes. It may be a cultural thing, or industry-specific, as you say.", "It could be because this company has had a lot of drama with friends/family working together so they made it a policy not to hire people related?", "Being related sure.  Just knowing someone?  No, that is not really a thing on job interviews.  In-laws gets to be a grey area.  Don't ask, don't tell.", "Well, I assume OP or her husband asked, \u201cDo they know your relation to (husband)?\u201d and the BIL probably just said no. \n\nIt seems like OP and her husband have a major chip on their shoulder and see the husband\u2019s employer as \u201cthe enemy,\u201d and simply hearing that the brother got the job probably put them on the offensive looking for ways that the brother \u201cbetrayed\u201d them.", "Which still isn't a betrayal.", "And? OP\u2019s husband was involved in drama at work, whether unfairly or not. It isn\u2019t a mystery why OP\u2019s BIL wouldn\u2019t willingly or enthusiastically disclose their relationship. If I was having work troubles and my BIL started working at the same company, I\u2019d probably tell him don\u2019t mention me so that you get the job. \n\nAs for the BIL\u2019s reason for going to that company, it really doesn\u2019t matter. He is free to change jobs for any reason under the sun. He can\u2019t work at the same company as OP\u2019s husband because OP\u2019s husband was involved in a workplace dispute, even though the husband still works there himself? Why not?\n\nETA: after reading more, OP\u2019s husband doesn\u2019t still work there, but he did work there for a while after the transfer. OP admits that the bully was reprimanded and her husband was not, so sounds like they handled the situation appropriately. \n\nAs for her husband being moved to a different department, odds are that he generally didn\u2019t get along with people and rather than completely rehire a whole team/department, they moved the friction point.", "Your husband is YOUR family member, not your brother's. Friends or not, they are just two dudes that know each other.", "Good lord you are overreaching so hard here I'm surprised you haven't dislocated your shoulder. This isn't a slight against your husband or your family, stop taking it as such.", "I think what is confusing ppl is you saying that he was choosing to deny a family member, when it sounds like your brother just didn't bring up your husband in the interview, and there's no reason for him to do that. \n\nIf they brought up your husband for some weird reason and he pretended not to know him, that would be one thing. But that doesn't seem to be what happened here. \n\nIt definitely sucks to get bullied, your husband should probably look for a different job. But I don't think you should break your relationship with your brother over something like this that doesn't seem to be him attempting to hurt your husband. I think that you are placing your anger over your husband being bullied onto your brother because you needed an outlet for that anger.", "Really companies will do what is the best for them.\n\nIf the bully was seen as critical to the department in question, it isn't surprising they moved the victim instead.  \n\nThe fact that the bully wasn't just fired says a lot.", "Exactly!", "Like, apparently not telling people in an interview that you are related to somebody who left under acrimonious circumstances is a huge betrayal, so now I'm wondering what bullying is to OP and her husband. Was spreading false rumours just... not agreeing to husband's version of events? Was denying access to projects just... not putting husband on projects that husband wanted?", "why on earth would someone buy a new house when it's only 10 min of a closer drive? you sound SO dramatic", "So him not mentioning he knows your husband in an interview at a company that seemingly isn't a fan of your husband is the same as Judas ratting out Jesus for some coins leading to his brutal death by crucifixion? \n\nThis feels like a mountain out of a molehill situation.", "Stop saying Judas move. It was Peter that denied Jesus, not Judas. Jesus H Christ, I\u2019m an atheist and I know this.", "Yeah, seems very fishy. Every job I\u2019ve ever had has asked that and I\u2019ve seen a woman get dismissed for lying about it. It\u2019s super weird also that he\u2019d want to apply to a job that treated someone he was so close with horribly.", "if that's the case I think you're going to get a lot of people in this comment section who are confused. that is absolutely not the case in any other type of job I've ever been in. I believe you that a place would fire you for lying about such a thing, but the vast majority of the time the only person in this entire scenario who could possibly care is OP and her husband, and to me it came off completely bizarre that they care this much.", "Thank you Lmfao. I\u2019m not even Christian (I\u2019m Jewish) and was sitting her like \u201cuhhhhhh, actually\u2026\u201d", "Totally agree, and if I were in bad standing with a past or current employer and someone I knew wanted to apply for a job, I\u2019d tell them not to mention me to help their chances. \n\nThe only way I\u2019d be upset is if something truly horrible happened to me as a targeted action by the company as a whole (not a single actor in the company), for example if I were the victim of systematic discrimination or something big like that, indicating that the whole company is shit and not just my team/colleagues/immediate environment. If it were just an interpersonal conflict, I\u2019d tell my family member what happened to warn them of what they might experience, and then leave it at that, allowing them to make their own choice about whether this is the type of work environment they want. I definitely wouldn\u2019t expect them to disclose their relation to me while interviewing.", "They\u2019re brother-in-laws which classify as family.", "BINGO", "Yeeeep I'm shocked so many people don't \"believe\" a company would do this like.... have you ever worked anywhere?? I'd argue the majority of companies would pull some bs like this. Legality and enforceability are, unfortunately, two different realities. Also quitting is not in the cards for everyone, either.\n\nI was bullied at a job for months and reporting it did nothing but prompt a few unproductive meetings. I did unpaid labor at 17 because I was lied to about the clock in process and the owner knew he could get away with it. If they can get away with it, a company *will* do it.", "Very true. Keeping around a person who is truly a bully opens up the business to legal ramifications though. That is always bad for the company.", "You're very aggressive towards him so yeah he doesn't want to engage with you. You aren't the committee who decides if his reasons are good enough, and he doesn't have to open up and explain things to you either.", "If she didn't care, there would not be several instances of her bringing it up. She cares. She's just disingenuous", "I'm 50. I've worked at companies of every size, and I've seen this sort of thing play out a number of times.  \n\nThere are so many reasons why the victim could be the one transferred, and in most cases the company has latitude to just change your job/department/etc. without explanation.\n\nIf you don't like it, your real option is generally to quit.", "If the company thinks it needs the bully to succeed, they will keep the bully and deal with the problems when they arise. Lots of companies are in constant survival mode.", "Actually, gaslighting is about getting victim to doubt their own sanity. This could be gaslighting if it were part of a pattern, but this is just invalidation."]}
