So that\u2019s a big word to throw around. To recap:\n\n1. Your husband was being bullied at work and was transferred against his will. Now, I have a hard time believing there are no underlying factors AND you husband had no recourse for the \u201cbullying\u201d. In your post you never say why you husband was having  issues in his job. Why did this person suddenly start to single out your husband.\n\n2. Your brother applied for a job at the same company because he wanted to change jobs. You say he didn\u2019t receive any type of benefit, but you also said he didn\u2019t like the role he was in. How can that NOT be a benefit. \u201cI don\u2019t like my current job so I got a new job\u201d. If a person doesn\u2019t like their current job they may make a lateral move (I move to a job of similar pay / title) to get away from the job they don\u2019t like.\n\n3. Based on your own responses, you have no clue why your husbands name would even come up during your brothers interview. Which my guess is, it likely didn\u2019t. HOWEVER, I would not list a person who\u2019s not currently excelling at the company as a reference.\n\n4. You claim you have no issue with him getting a job there just not proclaiming that he knows your husband, but I\u2019m looking for a REASONABLE explanation as to why he would even need to mention your husband?\n\nOverall, YTA. While your husband is not doing well at his current company, that has not to do with your brother and it\u2019s not on your brother to take up some \u201cfight\u201d that he has no knowledge of and \u201cno dog in the fight\u201d. You are rightfully distressed for your husband,  but maybe it\u2019s time for your husband to find another job.", "Recruiter here - Not sure why your husband would come up in an interview process, so not sure why you're upset. \n\nI don't think they asked him if he knew your husband given they have different surnames. Frankly, you sound a bit exhausting making this massive jump", "So, taking this all at face value, why would your brother bring up knowing your husband if he thought it would hurt his chances of employment? That's not a thing a rational person would do. It's not a matter of \"shame\" even with the biased framing you've provided.  So yes, barring other information,  YTA.", "YTA. You are making this small non event into a mountain. Why is there such shame, hurt and anger over someone who isn't you? There are plenty of employers that may prefer to hire someone their employees know, and plenty others who don't want to get caught showing favoritism to new hires because they know someone. The situation has literally nothing to do with you, and you're taking on so much emotional labor that it's concerning. \n\nYou said it right here -\n\n>Brother applied for job and pretended not to know my husband because he thought it would hurt his chances of getting the job\n\nEmployers don't want drama. But you are drama, I can tell from the way you talk.\n\n>The harassment was so bad that my husband was transferred to another job/ department against his wishes\n\nSo he wanted to stay where he was being harassed? \ud83e\udd14\n\n>We honestly don\u2019t know the reason for the co-worker\u2019s hate\n\n>We were still reeling from the unwanted job transfer\n\n>we\u2019re knocked off our feet by my brother\u2019s shame \n\n>hurt and angry, as well as expecting an apology?\n\nAllll drama. Y'all act like your brother is the one bullying your husband. There's no betrayal here either. Some of the best advice I've ever gotten was to stop taking things so personally and stop making everything about me. That would probably help you greatly in this situation.", "YTA- Why would you be hurt? Your husband was a negative element to getting hired. Any grown up knows this. You don't know his motivation, but you attribute to him the worst motivations.  He can change jobs for any reason and he doesn't need your approval. You're butt hurt over nothing.", "You seem so extreme, why are you calling your brother a Judas over this? Why is any of it your business? If your husband wasn\u2019t well liked and was transferred over issues it makes sense he wasn\u2019t brought up. Why are you so invested in something that really has nothing to do with you or your husband? Be happy for your brother and move on.", "Yta. he didn't start the job and then start denying knowledge, he interviewed and probably wanted the job based on merit not by who he knows.

Bullying is by no means a good thing and should not be happening no matter what age you are but I feel like a lot of info is being left out. As to what he did or didn't do to warrant the bullying. Also, for your brother situation, I feel like he did nothing wrong. It's a little strange that he would switch job knowing the pay isn't any better, but it was his choice to applied, interview, and accepted the job. Him claiming not to know your husband can be for a whole different reason. I mean now that he started working there alongside your husband do they talk or see each other often?

And unless someone point blank asked the brother \u201cdo you know OP\u2019s husband?\u201d and he said no, there was no denying. It was information he chose to not disclose. It sounds to me like the \u201cdisloyalty\u201d is really about her being angry that her brother went to work for a company that she feels is mistreating her husband.", "YTA.\n\nThis whole thing is actually sort of hilarious. OP legitimately believes that her brother went to all this trouble of switching jobs, just to hurt her feelings. This, despite claiming to know that her brother and her husband are good friends who get along well. Why would your brother do this, OP? The simple explanation is likely right - he didn't do anything to hurt you, he was just trying to get a job, and knew that there had been some drama around your husband lately, so he thought maybe mentioning the connection wouldn't help him in the interview process.\n\nStop reading insult into things that don't even have anything to do with you!\n\nIf your brother and your husband are friends, then be happy that is the case and don't worry about what your brother is doing at work.", "INFO - what did you expect? He isn't interviewing based on knowing your husband. He's interviewing on his own merits. Your husband should never have come up in the interview. Did you expect your brother to bring him up?

That is not your business, so let it go.\n\nSecond, unless the interviewer asked your brother if he had any connections within the company, your brother was under no obligation to disclose the relationship.\n\nFinally, whatever you believe, your husband isn\u2019t telling you the truth about what\u2019s happening at work. If they have a Human Resources department, he should be working with them to fight for better workplace treatment; instead he\u2019s accepting garbage department transfers? Something is off here.\n\nYou\u2019re focusing your attention and upset at your brother for some reason, when he\u2019s done nothing wrong and owes you nothing. Mind your side of the street, not his.", "INFO: Your husband being bullied, and then having HIM get transferred, doesn't really pass the smell test to me. Against his wishes is also another interesting facet of the whole thing.

Very wise even.", "YTA.  Betrayal?  What betrayal exactly?  Why does any of this matter?  Apology?", "i don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough info tbh. what was your husband bullied about? did you brother hate his old job? could it be there are better benefits with your husband\u2019s company? does this company hire their employees\u2019 family members? i don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for being upset, but i also don\u2019t think your brother is an AH for getting the job, unless there\u2019s more information you find later on.\n\nNAH. i get both sides, but i don\u2019t think you should make a mountain out of a mole hill. if you need space from your brother, take it, but don\u2019t let yourself get too caught up in what ifs and thinking the worst, it\u2019s not worth your energy", "INFO: How does your husband feel about your brother having his old job?

BUT your brother activly, with no need, applied for a position in a company who not only treated his \"best friend\" very bad but where he will work with ppl who bullied your husband. \n\nThats quit a loud message i think. He wants to tell you and your husband this way he agrees with the bullying and how the company handled it so much, he even wants to work there and be around these people for a significant part of his every day life.\n\nI would understand it if the pay or benefits are better and he needs it, but from what you write, the only reason i can see why he applied there is bc the way they treated your husband made your brother some kind of fanboy and he really really wanted to become part of the group who used to bully his \"friend\". So it seems like for some reason your brother really dislikes your husband and this is his way of telling you this. I'm surprised you only want an apology. I don't know if i could ever trust him again tbh. \n\nBut the story does sound strange. Are you really sure there is no, really no good reason for your brother to take a job there?", "NTA.

And of course, when he is interviewing for a new job is not the time for him to get on a soapbox about knowing your husband and how close they are.

Your brother bringing it up absolutely would've sabotaged his chances. \n2. If you know there's a situation that might make your job worse, you keep your mouth shut.

My husband is actually doing very well at his job - he is not happy that he was forced to move , but he made lemonade out of lemons.  I accept you think IATA.  But please re-read my post.  You have put words in my mouth that I did not say.", "I was not in the room during the interview!  The only thing I know is my brother told me that he pretended not to know my husband.

If feelings are always dismissed as drama how can anybody ever heal?   Mother\u2019s take in the pain of their children- would you ridicule them?  When people morn a death, are they criticized as being dramatic?  This is not about the employer hiring who they want - not the issue.  The issue is it morally OK to hurt a family member, intentionally, by denying you know them.  I was taught to be compassionate, empathize with those hurting and to stand by your family.  I do appreciate the responses that say IATA  - I try to use them to grow.

I don't find OP to be a reliable narrator based on her comments, their general drama and grandiosity, and her hostility and avoidance of straightforward questions.\n\nI'm just gonna say -- I've seen plenty of people in my professional life take direct, professional feedback as personal criticism and attacks. I've seen *more* people entrench and grow defensive over feedback than I have seen people genuinely *bullied* by their employer. To be sure, I've seen both. But I'm not willing to take people at their word for it without concrete examples, identified patterns. Please know and keep in mind, that when an outspoken 'Christian' gets push back for their microaggressions against an LGBT colleague, they *frame* it as bullying - even when it isn't. Likewise for any sort of bigot or misogynist. Sometimes it's just arrogant gits who alienate their colleagues with smug self-importance and then are surprised to find people don't like working with them and it creates issues on their team. OP's description of the 'bullying' is extremely light on any real details.\n\nFeels like missing missing reasons to me.", "Thank you.  I think you are the first person to understand what is involved.  Personally, I always consider people who will be affected by my decision, before I make a decision.

I would have chosen my relationship with my brother over a dumb, non-career type job.", "I agree, the story does sound strange. I\u2019m still wondering about the phrasing her brother used: \u201cI pretended not to know him\u201d. What is the point of including that information in his story to his sister? Emphasizing that he \u201cpretended\u201d to have no affiliation with his brother-in-law seems pointed, kind of over the top. \n\n OP\u2019s narrative style is a bit dramatic, but there is something odd about the use of the word \u201cpretended\u201d.

Your brother did not intentionally hurt your husband's feelings and by continuing to believe that you are creating the hurt and anger. You literally asked him why he did it and his answer had nothing to do with shame or embarrassment. You are ignoring perfectly reasonable explanations as to why your brother did this.\n\nAnd now you're taking this situation and bringing up mourning the death of a loved one, parents hurting for their children.

You seem to think you have some sort of place or authority when you do not.\n\nYour husband was detrimental to your brother getting the job. There is no argument about that. It stands to reason keeping that info from the new employer was key to getting the job. In my experience people don't just \"get moved\" in a company unless there is a problem with their personality or performance. You and your husband seem to be quite the pair. You both need to accept that you have no business or say in your brothers life and what he chooses to do.
