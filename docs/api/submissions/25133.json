I\u2019ve been a woman since the day I was born but my mom doesn\u2019t seem to think that way. \n\nWhen I was younger she would only buy me \u201cboy\u2019s\u201d toys like cars and action figures and whatever. I had to dress like a boy, act like a boy. \n\nWhen I got older and started trying to be a girl for once, I tried putting on a dress and makeup at my 13th birthday party. My mom made me change, scrubbed the makeup off my face, and cut my hair short. And that\u2019s how she\u2019s made me continue to look. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have an issue with the fact that I date boys, she just calls me her gay son. Which is moronic, because any time I meet one of her friends for the first time, they have the natural question of \u201cwhy does your supposedly gay son look like a girl and have breasts?\u201d\n\nI hate it. I fucking hate it. Is it so absurd for me to wear a fucking dress for once? To have long hair like every other fucking girl? Why the hell does she insist on calling me her gay son when I\u2019m so clearly not?\n\nSo I asked my dad (he split up with my mom years ago and I only have limited contact with him). He told me that before I was born, my mom had this obsession with being a family with a son, like, it\u2019s all she would ever talk about. She had a son shortly before me, but it died shortly after birth due to some kind of heart defect. When she had a daughter, she swore to raise me as her \u201clost\u201d son. \n\nI confronted her and told her that no matter what she has delusions herself into thinking, I\u2019m not her miscarried son, and she needs to accept that before she loses her daughter. \n\nHer response was to look at me and say \u201cI don\u2019t have a daughter, I have a son.\u201d\n\nI packed my shit up and left that night. I\u2019m staying over at my friend\u2019s house for the time being, and I don\u2019t plan on going back. I turn 18 in a few weeks, so after that she can\u2019t make me. \n\nMy friend\u2019s parents know the whole situation and they\u2019re willing to let me stay while this all gets figured out, if it does. They said they\u2019re happy to have me if nothing gets resolved. \n\nMy mom, however, has been blowing up my phone telling me to please come home and that she needs her little boy. I told her to fuck off and that she\u2019ll never have a son, and if she doesn\u2019t sort out her mental shit, pretty soon she won\u2019t have a daughter. \n\nI genuinely don\u2019t think I\u2019m over reacting here.

She then messed my sister up by buying her 2 of everything her whole life, sitting her down when she was 16 to \u201cexplain why\u201d (bc of her \u201cdead sister\u201d), and also threw in some gems like \u201cso that\u2019s why you\u2019ve probably felt alone or incomplete your whole life.\u201d \ud83e\udd2f\n\nBut, no, this post is one of the most damaging things I\u2019ve read in a long time.
