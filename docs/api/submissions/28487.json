{"id": 28487, "submission_id": "172y3aw", "title": "AITA for refusing to plan my wife's birthday dinner around her family?", "selftext": "My wife (26F) is the baby of her family and her birthday has become a bit of a sore topic for her. Ever since she was little she was asked to accommodate for her family when it came to birthday meals. Her brother in-law (married to her oldest sister who has been around since she was 2) has Crohn's Disease and of course they have dietary restrictions due to this. But my wife is the only person in her family who has to sacrifice for this.\n\nMy FIL only likes steak and potatoes. He is very strict with that and despises \"weird ass exotic food with weird sauces\" and my wife is expected to accommodate him as well.\n\nMy MIL is huge into salads but like her husband doesn't like \"exotic veg\" aka Asian veggies. My wife is expected to accommodate for her as well.\n\nNeither of the parents like spicy food or \"foreign foods\".\n\nMy SIL (not the one married to the BIL with Crohn's) doesn't like \"heavy food\" and no, I don't really know all the details on that. But again, my wife must accommodate.\n\nThis shit started back when she was 5 and back then her favorite meal was this chicken casserole dish her grandmother used to make. My wife remembers her parents asking if they could have steak and salads with soup for her birthday dinner instead of the casserole because everyone else would struggle to eat. She was upset and they saw that and she remembers a little pressure being added and she agreed and almost identical conversations happened every year after that.\n\nWhen she got older they were all doing dinners in a restaurant for birthdays and my wife could never have either of her favorite places. She had two choices total and those two were the ones that could accommodate everyone else's food requests and she never got to have a meal she loved on her birthday.\n\nI have known my wife for 9 years now and I have witnessed it year after year and she's lost a lot of joy or interest in her birthday. So this year I decided that I was going to take over planning her birthday celebration and I chose her favorite restaurant. Our friends and my family have all said they will come. But my ILs have complained about the restaurant of choice. I told them the venue had been booked and we will understand if they can't come.\n\nI got replies back saying they want to come but can't and I said that was unfortunate. They told me my wife always makes accommodations for them. I confirmed that it was true and I pointed out they never return the favor. I asked why they should enjoy her birthday meal more than her. They said it's not like that and I said yes it is. I said they take advantage of her love for them and the fact she doesn't want to upset or leave anyone out. I told them they should be doing the same for her on HER birthday. I told them I would not plan her birthday dinners around them anymore and they will not change my mind.\n\nThey're pissed at me and are saying I will be the reason they won't be able to come.\n\nAITA?

The IL\u2019s saying they can\u2019t come is bullshit. If my child or a sibling had a birthday dinner at a restaurant I didn\u2019t like then I would simple eat beforehand and show up to the party to show my love.\n\nAlmost all restaurants have SOMETHING to accommodate people with food issues. The family could google the restaurant\u2019s menu or call ahead to find a dish that\u2019s suitable for them\u2014if they wanted to.\n\nThat being said, don\u2019t count on your wife being happy with the decision you made. It\u2019s possible her family being there means more to her than having her top choice in a restaurant.", "NTA. \n\nThe other thing is... they *can* come. They can just eat beforehand if there is literally nothing that they will eat at the restaurant. Vegans do this all the time. Surely, there are at least beverages that people can consume? Does the restaurant not serve salads at all? Does the FIL literally ONLY eat steak? Like, dinner literally every night for your wife growing up was steak and potatoes? He won't even eat, say, bread? \n\nIt doesn't sound like anybody has something like a shellfish allergy where they can't even be in a room where shellfish is served. They just either have medical dietary needs or are very particular about what they consume. Both of these things are fine, but going around expecting that everybody is going to accomodate all of these things all the time is ludicrous... particularly on the part of the people who are just being picky and do not have medical needs.  \n\nEven if they do not eat at all, they can come and have a glass of water. It's one night.", "NTA - and I officially nominate you for Husband of the year for fully having your wife's back.  You are making her birthday about HER, not her \"so called\" family.\n\nGo hubby go, you got this.

No special dinners. Gifts were often bought during post-Christmas sales and wrapped in Christmas wrapping paper because it was convenient.\n\nWe changed that. Her birthday is a specific and separate celebration and has been for a long time now. She gets to decide what we do. I even managed to pull off a surprise party for her one year.\n\nIn the end, your wife is who you're building a life with. She's the one who should take priority over your in-laws. Let them be pissed.", "The only one that gets a pass is the BIL but even then most places will have at least one suitable dish. NTA", "NTA. With the exception of the brother, who has medical reasons not to eat certain foods, everyone else is just being picky and difficult.", "NTA!!

I hope she loves it and brings back the joy for her birthdays!!", "NTA. At the very least, one could expect their favorite meal on their birthday.  KUDOS for taking charge of this situation.   It would have been SO easy for this family to have cooked a chicken casserole for the birthday girl AND added all everyone else liked. Everyone\u2019s preferences were taken into consideration EXCEPT hers. It\u2019s very strange really. It\u2019s like the family wanted to emphasize over the years that she didn\u2019t matter AT ALL.

Her family sounds like a toxic mess of entitled people. Take your wife to her favorite place and ignore the imbeciles.", "NTA. At some point you should give up the idea that birthday dinners are going to be pleasant. I\u2019d much rather go do something I love than accommodate a bunch of other people who never reciprocate.

Thank you for putting your wife first.", "NTA\n\n WELL DONE! Keep up the good work for all birthdays going forward. She has sacrificed enough for those selfish people.", "NTA and good for you!", "U r not the asshole. It's her bday, she should get to choose where we eat.

I suffered with that shit for years until asshole sister moved out. She complained about everything.  We got stuck eating bologna sandwiches for a year because of her in our lunches.", "NTA. Good on you. Make it your hill to die on. Replace them with friends and keep being awesome.", "NTA Those family members who can\u2019t be flexible at one meal are definitely AH\u2019s. It\u2019s ridiculous that they can\u2019t find one single item on a menu that will work.

You wouldn\u2019t be the first male partner to learn that female partners want to be listened to when we vent not have you do anything about it.   You may find out  that she actually wants her family around on her BDay and that\u2019s why she really accommodated them.  Your planning effectively eliminated her family from her BDay and ultimately she may not like that \u2026 she may also love it and make it a new tradition.  But be aware this has the potential to blow up in you face.", "NTA! \n\nSounds like this is a bigger issue than birthday dinners tho. This sounds like a complete lack of respect for your wife and her wishes (and probably needs) by her entire family, to the point it is now expected. Good on you for standing up for her when they\u2019ve groomed her for her entire life to give way to their wants!\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already I would suggest starting some traditions that do not include her family or lessen their involvement in important events. Her birthday is a great start but I would also look at other holidays (Christmas, thanksgiving, Easter etc) if the expectation is that her whole family gets together \u201coh we can\u2019t possibly make it for the whole day (or 3) this Christmas, but we\u2019ll swing by about 11 so we can open presents with the niblings\u201d. Your wife probably doesn\u2019t even realise how big of a toll this kind of stuff is on her because she has never known any different - it\u2019s only in the absence of those things that you realise how much it was.\n\nEdit to add - it\u2019s also perfectly reasonable to say \u201cI have checked and BiL\u2019s restrictions can be easily accommodated. For everyone else it is personal preference and it\u2019s pretty strange that your preference of a salad or a type of meat is more important than your own child\u2026\u2026\u201d just make sure you maintain eye contact if you do say it that plainly.", "Nope.  She gets to pick.   If I were invited I would check the menu online.   There has to be something they can have.  And if there isn\u2019t, I would still go and have a drink or dessert or something just to be with my family member.", "NTA. I am vegetarian (can't eat mushrooms and hate creamy cheese sauces), my partner has crohns disease (and has also had short bowel syndrome and acalasia), 2 relatives gluten free, 1 can't have hot food due to a heart condition, 1who can't have soy. And we always manage to go out together, whoever birthday it is gets the main vote and if someone doesn't like much on the menu, we've had it where someone might just order a couple starters, I've been to a steak house, because my relative is very much a meat, potato, veg kind of guy and loves a good steak, I had a few cocktails, a few sides and a lovely pudding, we had a great night.", "Update us after the dinner, I'm betting they all show up .", "NTA. It's your wife's birthday, not theirs. She deserves to enjoy her birthday dinner. Other than BIL with Crohn's, no one has excuses besides preferences.", "NTA\n\nGood for you!!", "NTA, and definitely husband of the year!", "NTA!! For the first time in years somebody has put her first on her birthday. You've also held a mirror up to the faces of her family and they don't like what is being reflected back.", "NTA. Does your wife's family realize birthdays don't have to be celebrated on the actual birthday?

Hope your wife will enjoy her birthday for once :)", "They can meet with her somewhere else of come to the house for cake. NTA", "NTA \nLike i get the crohns disease but disliking \u201cexotic vegetables\u201d and foreign foods? Tells me a lot about what type of people they are", "It depends on what makes your wife happy. Is it more important to her to have her family there or it to be the restaurant she enjoys? Also someone with a true medical condition needing accommodation is different than a preference. Maybe do two different celebrations? One for family and one for friends?", "NTA \n\nThere needs to be a new rule: wife\u2019s family doesn\u2019t get to celebrate her with meals. Go bowling, go for a hike, go for drinks, but celebratory meals that do not honor the actual guest it\u2019s for are now out", ">My MIL is huge into salads but like her husband doesn't like \"exotic veg\" aka Asian veggies.\n\nI don't even know what that means.

But my former boss has two people in his family of 4 with very serious Celiac disease & it is still sacred that the birthday person picks the restaurant.  When his non-celiac daughter picks, the other two just figure something out, most restaurants will give you a plate of raw veggies if nothing else.", "NTA\n\nIt sucks when you realize that your family does not love you the way you love them. It sucks your wife has had that knowledge since age 5. \n\nIt\u2019s awesome that she now has a husband that loves her enough to plan her birthday based on her favorite things. \n\nIt continues to suck that they had the jewels to try and get you to continue to subvert her day for them.

I feel like most places have some kind of steak or beef dish if that\u2019s really what they have to eat, but even if this place doesn\u2019t, they can still go! I\u2019ve gone to things at restaurants I didn\u2019t eat at\u2014you just eat before or after, it\u2019s not hard.

You are doing the same thing her family does to her, not giving her a choice. Go talk to your wife and tell her what you did and make sure she is comfortable with what you have done: if it is not don\u2019t be scared to back down.

If your wife isn't in therapy, may I suggest a birthday present of couple's counseling to \"help navigate family issues, learn to set boundaries and apply appropriate escalating consequences\" with ALL extended family (yup, yours too, even if she thinks they're angels).

Mind you, I believe you're absolutely right and have the best and most loving of intentions, but the way you're handling things will bring a lot of drama to her birthday without checking with her first, she may not be down to it right now. Maybe all that conflict with her relatives will make her much more stressed in the day of her birthday than having to endure not getting the food she likes and deal with her family's disregard for her, which are not new things for her. Have you considered other ways to accommodate your ILs and still offer dishes just for her? Why not a dinner party at home, ordering or cooking different foods for everyone, along with a special selection just for her? (And I need a little info: why did her parents never make something like that?) Why not planning two parties, stopping by her parents and sharing just a small cake and then going to a restaurant she likes with everyone else (that maybe would involve some drama as well, but would make it possible to disclose this part of your decision to her and see how it goes, keeping the other part a surprise). I mean, I believe there are possible solutions around this situation and you went for starting conflict with her family without her input. They are the bigger AHs, of course, and I totally empathize with you and think you're right and a thoughtful spouse, but it's possible to end up like a little bit of an AH even like this.", "Honestly YTA. It's good that you're trying to stand up for your wife but I think you went about it the wrong way. You caused drama between you and her parents and put your wife in the middle of it. If she hasn't said anything for the past 20+ years I doubt she wanted to say something now. You should've talked to your wife about it before you said anything to her parents. I think a better solution would've been for you and her go out for an actual birthday dinner that she enjoys and then just endure a few hours of dinner with her family to keep the peace lol", "Eta- YTA.

Ever since she was little she was asked to accommodate for her family when it came to birthday meals. Her brother in-law (married to her oldest sister who has been around since she was 2) has Crohn's Disease and of course they have dietary restrictions due to this. But my wife is the only person in her family who has to sacrifice for this.\n\nMy FIL only likes steak and potatoes. He is very strict with that and despises \"weird ass exotic food with weird sauces\" and my wife is expected to accommodate him as well.\n\nMy MIL is huge into salads but like her husband doesn't like \"exotic veg\" aka Asian veggies. My wife is expected to accommodate for her as well.\n\nNeither of the parents like spicy food or \"foreign foods\".\n\nMy SIL (not the one married to the BIL with Crohn's) doesn't like \"heavy food\" and no, I don't really know all the details on that. But again, my wife must accommodate.\n\nThis shit started back when she was 5 and back then her favorite meal was this chicken casserole dish her grandmother used to make. My wife remembers her parents asking if they could have steak and salads with soup for her birthday dinner instead of the casserole because everyone else would struggle to eat. She was upset and they saw that and she remembers a little pressure being added and she agreed and almost identical conversations happened every year after that.\n\nWhen she got older they were all doing dinners in a restaurant for birthdays and my wife could never have either of her favorite places. She had two choices total and those two were the ones that could accommodate everyone else's food requests and she never got to have a meal she loved on her birthday.\n\nI have known my wife for 9 years now and I have witnessed it year after year and she's lost a lot of joy or interest in her birthday. So this year I decided that I was going to take over planning her birthday celebration and I chose her favorite restaurant. Our friends and my family have all said they will come. But my ILs have complained about the restaurant of choice. I told them the venue had been booked and we will understand if they can't come.\n\nI got replies back saying they want to come but can't and I said that was unfortunate. They told me my wife always makes accommodations for them. I confirmed that it was true and I pointed out they never return the favor. I asked why they should enjoy her birthday meal more than her. They said it's not like that and I said yes it is. I said they take advantage of her love for them and the fact she doesn't want to upset or leave anyone out. I told them they should be doing the same for her on HER birthday. I told them I would not plan her birthday dinners around them anymore and they will not change my mind.\n\nThey're pissed at me and are saying I will be the reason they won't be able to come.\n\nAITA? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

However, it's my job to figure out what I can eat at specific places. Not whoever invited me to the event. I've even had times where something I thought I could eat still makes me sick.

It might be a wonderful surprise for her.", "NTA\n\nEven if they can't eat most of what's on the menu, there'll **always** be something they can enjoy - but it sounds like what they enjoy most is getting their own way, so tough luck for them this year.\n\nYou are a great husband. Just keep making it clear to the ILs that it was *YOUR* choice to eat at this restaurant, so they don't have a valid reason to hassle your wife. They probably still will, but they won't have a valid reason to so you can shut them down with lines like, \"She didn't pick the restaurant this year, I did - got a problem?

Your wife deserves to be celebrated in a way that centers around her, and she's lucky to have a partner that realizes that. \n\nWith people pleasers in enmeshed families, the smallest \"slight\" will set the folks who have benefited most from the lack of boundaries off, so be ready for some mess from them.   \n\nThis analogy helped a lot as I was navigating boat rocking:\n\nDon't Rock the Boat\n\n I've been thinking about this phrase a lot lately, about how unfair it is. Because we aren't the ones rocking the boat. It's the crazy person jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a crap.\n \n\nAt some point in her youth, boat rocker gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So they do it again, and again. Soon their family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. They moves left, the family moves right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own.\n\n The boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by themself. They've never had to face the consequences of her rocking. They'll tip over. So they find an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking.\n\n The boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, they're the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize. How can they fix the situation?\n \nBallast!\n\n And the next generation of boat-steadiers is born.\n\n A born boat-steadier doesn't know what solid ground feels like. She's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him to swim either. She'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, because it did .\n\n When you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that you aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.\n \n\n Now you and your partner get a boat of your own. With partner not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder.\n\n While a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something!\n\n So the flying monkeys are dispatched. Can't you and your partner see how much better it is for everyone (else) if you just get back on the boat and keep it steady? It would make their lives so much easier.\n\nYou know what would make their lives easier? If they all just chucked the bitch overboard.", "NTA.", "NTA - good on you man.

Like breakfast, lunch, and dinner, always steak and potatoes? I find it difficult to believe that the other family members are incapable of sucking it up for one meal once a year, or that the restaurant of choice has no options that could make them happy.

You can get something plain if you want at most places.", "I've got a deadly food allergy, and most restaurants serve things in that family, so I can't eat most places. Instead, I get a nice tall glass of ice water with lemon and enjoy the company. It's not a big deal to either eat before or after the event.", "I'm on a diet that makes any restaurants that use soy sauce and high glutamate foods (seaweed, any type of gums, fermented products), but if worse came to worse, there's plain rice, some sort of steamed vegetables, salad without dressing but olive oil (most vinegars and citrus are restricted from my diet, and I'd have to make a dressing or read the label to trust a creamy one)--I'm a bit more relaxed than this now after over a year on the diet, but it starts like this chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/[https://migraine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/elimination\\_diet\\_comprehensive.pdf](https://migraine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/elimination_diet_comprehensive.pdf)\n\nI can't imagine being so pissy about it just because the food is weird. I can imagine the person with Crohn's having some feelings, but they might even be able to call ahead to see if there is something he could eat.", "i didn't even know they still made that stuff.", "Lmao bingo.\n\nI'm pretty sure his mother had ARFID - she ate nothing but grilled cheese sandwiches made with Wonder Bread and Kraft Singles from toddlerhood through her death in her early 90s.  She just wouldn't eat if those things weren't an option.  She occasionally had an apple or pancakes maybe once a year or so.\n\nHer cooking was good though and her dessert recipes were family legends.  She never ate anything she prepared though outside of a grilled cheese sandwich 3 times a day washed down with diet coke or Bud Light.", "He might be preserved from all that salt!", "And if there were only some simple way she could have ONE  day where she doesn't have to accommodate the AHs in her family in order for them to spend time with her", "Yes you can keep saying that as many times as you want. If someone I am close to has a medical restriction then I am picking a restraint they can eat at IF I invite them. If I want special food then I will just go my favorite restaurant with my husband. We both clearly have different opinions on this which is fine.", "Bro, if you don't want to ruin this, then talk to her. Is this even a hill that she wants to die on? Maybe she'll be happy with you two going out and having a nice evening alone? Maybe you two need to have a deeper conversation about her setting boundaries with her family? We don't know, and you really won't either, because you're more interested in sticking it to her family and giving her a surprise than you are about finding out her desires.", "The thing is, it\u2019s not always about my son or me", "Who\u2019s suggesting leaving BIL out? Anyone with severe restrictions to their diet needs to take responsibility for that, including negotiating with a restaurant to byo food, or eating beforehand and still enjoying the company and celebrating the guest of honour.", "Yup.  I don't think anyone who isn't eligible to join AARP ever buys it though.", "Sometimes these things take baby steps. This year it might be two celebrations, one of which she plans. The next? Maybe she'll ask them to plan instead.\n\nShe's used to being walked all over. Laying down boundaries - even one as simple as I will eat at the restaurant I choose on my actual birthday and celebrate with you  at a later date at a different restaurant - is a huge milestone.", "OP should suggest that to them", "Which means you can make whatever accommodations you want but you\u2019re not entitled to it from others. \n\nIf you want to accommodate others that\u2019s fine, if they don\u2019t want to accommodate that\u2019s also fine. You don\u2019t get to emotionally blackmail and manipulate them with \u201cbut if you wanted me there you would accommodate\u201d or \u201cbut I accommodate you\u201d. Or tell them \u201ceither pick a restaurant we all like or go alone with your husband\u201d\n\nOP\u2019s wife has made it clear multiple times that ignoring her wishes and where she wants to eat is upsetting her and she is losing the joy of celebrating her birthday because they all whine and refuse to be adults and manage their own restrictions/preferences while making HER birthday about HER. \n\nIt\u2019s not fine when you\u2019re basically saying she either bows down to people\u2019s choices or doesn\u2019t celebrate with others.", ">BUT if you keep this from her, you run the risk of being part of the reason this year is ruined\n\nIf he keeps a restaurant choice from her? \n\nDo you realize how ridiculous that sounds? Are you a \u201cdon\u2019t rock the boat\u201d type of person? \n\nIt\u2019s very common and acceptable for a spouse to throw a surprise birthday dinner at a favorite restaurant. OP shouldn\u2019t have to bend over backwards catering to the guests just because they expect it.", "This is exactly right. My wife and I are vegan, and there have been many times when we\u2019ve gone to a dinner or event where there\u2019s little or nothing for us to eat. We simply plan around it and/or handle our own food. It\u2019s really not that difficult.", "I. . .I like carnations. . . \ud83d\ude13", "It can be helpful for those who are ill, live alone, etc, to get the calories that they need, a cheaper version of Ensure.", "But given the choice, no one who has been taught to accept that feels they can agree. It almost always takes someone else taking that stance for them. We went to a TON of therapy for that exact thing for my husband. It took me doing it and him having to see first hand how little he mattered and learn to accept that he deserves better. It sounds like the wife here could likely benefit from the same type of thing.", "> It\u2019s not fine when you\u2019re basically saying she either bows down to people\u2019s choices or doesn\u2019t celebrate with others.\n\nI don't think anybody is saying that.\n\nWhat they're saying is that it's her decision to make. It's HER birthday... Basically, what you're saying is that OP should decide for his wife. Which is sort of what the in-laws are doing. It's a dangerous game to play. \n\nMaybe the family is being shitty, but it's her call to make whether she wants to give in to that or not. If the wife wants to give in, you kinda have to give in, even if you think it's wrong. \n\nYou gotta pick your battles, and unfortunately, this isn't OP's battle. OP probably should've asked her first, made sure this was a fight she wanted to have... because if he's made the wrong call, his ass is on the line.", "It\u2019s not keeping the restaurant from her.  It\u2019s keeping from her the fact that her family is threatening not to come over the choice of restaurant.", "I agree, working with a pro will help a lot.", "Sometimes you stand up for the people you love. Yes his ass is on the line. And he knows she would prefer to celebrate her way but that her family will keep berating her until she bows down. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t like it then he\u2019ll know to back off. They\u2019re partners and he\u2019s standing up for her and taking a risk.

Not OP\u2019s.", "It\u2019s not about how he\u2019s handling her family - it\u2019s him *not* handling her family. \n\nHe planned a surprise birthday dinner at his wife\u2019s favorite restaurant and invited everyone he knows she\u2019d want. That\u2019s a super normal thing to do.", ">Props to op for thinking he knows better than his wife about how she wants to handle her family more .\n\nRight!?\n\nThis whole thread is full of people taking it upon themselves to decide on this woman's behalf what she wants for her birthday.\n\nThis shit's bonkers."]}
