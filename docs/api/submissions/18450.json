It's clear, at least in this post and in the comments, that you were just uncomfortable with their excessive PDA. You were invited into a group of 3 people to hang out, and the other 2 people mauled each other and ignored you the entire evening. That's awkward. I think your friend was embarrassed by you calling them out about this, so they dropped the homophobe card to win the argument.

Honestly, it doesnt matter what gender both have - it IS weird to be the third wheel and have the other two making out. Nothing homophobic there imo.

(Or, possibly, she thinks that gay relationships are exempt from \"normal\" relationship rules.)\n\nIt's worth having a conversation, either way, to figure out what she was thinking. I will say: it's *most likely* thoughtlessness, but only you know your friend well enough to guess. And a conversation will clarify a lot!", "I agree. It\u2019s a terrible feeling! I might\u2019ve gone the extreme route and hung out with mostly single friends (and friends who did have partners but didn\u2019t treat it as if I wasn\u2019t there) when I was 19-25, since the honeymoon phase for my couples friends was so real. \n\nIf it makes you feel better, I am 29 and have made a lot more friends who are in relationships/married now, and none of them act that way!

Both spoke flawless English. When I asked them to please speak English, one said, \"We are talking about medical things. You wouldn't be interested.\" \n\nAnyway, my point is that neglecting the third person at a table is always rude, whether you are snogging, speaking a different language, or whatever. If you invite someone out, you make them feel included. If you were homophobic you would not have gone out with them to begin with.", "Yeah there's a saying....a time and a place? And when out for food or whatever is not the place!", "Now that\u2019s a couple of assbags, how did you react?
