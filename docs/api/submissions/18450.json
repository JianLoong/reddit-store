It\u2019s uncomfortable no matter what.", "NTA. It\u2019s no fun being a third wheel/ having to be around anybody making out (I\u2019m personally not a massive fan of pda). Sounds like it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the fact that they\u2019re both female but more to do with the fact that you were essentially left on your own during a night out.\nObviously if it was just a little kissing here and there then that would change things but it sounds like they were having a really long session \ud83e\udee4", "NTA - I'm gay me and my boyfriend and I do things with us and a 3rd person all the time. We will still hold hands and kiss. we avoid doing things like making out because we know it would make us feel uncomfortable if we were the 3rd person. Gay straight doesn't matter. Other than that it's just rude to invite someone out then ignore them like that.", "NTA. No one wants to be the third wheel.", "NTA. It is rude to go out as three people and have a long conversation the third can not partake in, let alone a makeout session. What is the point of visiting you otherwise? It sounds like your friend is being intentionally obtuse.", "NTA - it\u2019s rude", "NTA\n\nThat was super rude of them. The typical \u201ecouple-monster\u201c that loves to show off in front of people to validate to themselves (and prove to everyone around) that they\u2018re an oh-so lovey-dovey and passionate couple \n\n(Usually they don\u2018t do as much when they\u2018re all alone at home.. if nobody sees it, is it even display of affection? /s ))", "NTA. It\u2019s awkward to sit at a table for three when two of them are making out.  It\u2019s rude to you and awkward. They came to visit you and then ignore you.", "NTA that\u2019s just inconsiderate.

Homophobia is not part of the equation.", "NTA it wasn\u2019t homophonic if they\u2019re full blown making out in front of you. That\u2019s just rude. But it also depends how long this lasted", "NTA, a quick peck is totally fine, but full on making out is awkward as hell. Sucks she accused you of homophobia, maybe try and explain your reasons to her", "NTA. It's clear, at least in this post and in the comments, that you were just uncomfortable with their excessive PDA. You were invited into a group of 3 people to hang out, and the other 2 people mauled each other and ignored you the entire evening. That's awkward. I think your friend was embarrassed by you calling them out about this, so they dropped the homophobe card to win the argument. You can try talking to your friend again, but I have a feeling she'd rather write you off as a bigot than admit she behaved inappropriately.", "Not only NTA, but I don't think you even went about it ineptly. It should be obvious you don't snog in front of the third wheel - it's not your responsibility to be elegant in an explanation that should be unnecessary.", "NTA\n\nIt's completely normal to feel uncomfortable in this situation. I felt the same whenever it happened to me. \n\nYour friend is the a-hole. Why would you be homophobic for feeling uncomfortable when the two people you've met with started making out?", "NTA if they are just going to be munching on each other then why did they even bother to come visit you? \n\nIf they need an audience to get of there are easier ways than going to bother your friends.\n\nI\u2019m all for showing you love each other but holding hand, a quick hug or peck is enough to do that. I don\u2019t appreciate being used as a prop in other\u2019s relationships.\n\nThe genders involved is irrelevant, it\u2019s the disrespect they are showing that matters.", "NTA. I\u2019m gay, and wouldn\u2019t want to sit there while a friend and her girlfriend make out in front of me. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s f/f, m/m, or f/m\u2026 that\u2019s just plain rude.", "If you would feel the same no matter the genders of the people involved (I know it wouldn\u2019t matter to me) then NTA. That can be very awkward and uncomfortable and it\u2019s quite rude of them to \u201cget to it\u201d right in front of you with no one else for you to talk to. That is awkward, no matter the genders.", "NTA, third wheeling sucks.", "I mean... You picked the worst way to talk about it, but NTA. \n\nYou have to explain it has nothing to do with them both being f and everything to do with feeling like a third wheel and it making you uncomfortable that you also don't have someone to make out with", "NTA No matter the gender/s of the couple, it is awkward and uncomfortable to sit with a couple who are making out. I\u2019d make that clear to your friend. Let her know you\u2019d feel the same way no matter which gender the couple is or is not.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The odd kiss is fine but full on making out constantly isn't very sociable", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t care the genders either it\u2019s just very third wheel!

Nobody wants to sit next to each other and see and hear this stuff. This is just disrespectful. I personally would walk away the next time. They clearly give a fuck if you are there or not. Or maybe... it turns them on when someone watch them? But i would no longer let me treat this way. Just because they are lovey dovey they don't need to hump each other nearly everywhere.", "NTA.  You just wanted a fun time in a public space.  Now, what you might want to do is light some candles and ask them to make out in front of you in the privacy of your home, if you're curious.  Personally, I would even recommend they get naked, but now I'm just being creepy.  :)", "NTA, also, major difference between kissing and full-out making out.", "Absolutely NTA , I find anyone making out in front of me very uncomfortable (gross, even)", "Is this your friends first relationship?

Good luck, you got this, and when you sit down to talk with them again make sure to apologize because you never want them to think that you aren't supportive, but that it was hard to communicate that you felt like a third wheel and isolated because it's hard to just say those things sometimes.", "Holy fuck 2 HOURS??? That\u2019s insane 100% NTA", "I didn\u2019t, maybe I should have. But she seemed really upset that I wasn\u2019t supportive of her and her girlfriend", "You should. It was pointed and succinct. You don\u2019t want to accompany them on THEIR date, you only want to go if the intention is to hangout. She\u2019s setting up double dates where she gets her gf and you get your hand! Not cool!"]}
