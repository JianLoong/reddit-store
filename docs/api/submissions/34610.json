We have similar interests so I often find myself around her since we don't all always go everywhere together.\n\nI noticed that whenever she meets people she tells them that she is from the UK and from London which isn't true. No one else does this and I wouldn't even when I do get UK citizenship. She does go a bit out of her way to pretend like she is from the UK, she dresses very British and over the years has started imitating a British accent even though there is a slight hint of Arabic and likes to never mention her Syrian past but still cooks and eats a lot of ethnic dishes.\n\nThe other day when we met some fellow travellers I jokingly called her out on it and was like haha she's actually Syrian. She seemed embarrassed but brushed it off and was quite avoidance when the others started asking her questions about Syria.\n\nEver since, she started being less friendly towards everyone but mostly myself when before that on this trip she was the person who was talking the most to me.\n\nI don't get why, i didn't say anything negative about Syria or anything and I didn't know she was that embarrassed to be from there and I think Syria is a cool place with a lot of history and beautiful landscapes despite it's current situation.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704717205, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191k7pz/aita_for_calling_out_my_friend_for_lying_about/", "score": 195, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mean,  I figured that out from a few sentences.  Her saying she's from the UK is obviously true to her so why did you feel the need to \"call her out\" for something that doesn't effect you in any way? YTA", "YTA - As a French citizen who spent her entire childhood NOT in France, two ethnicities and a parent born in another country altogether, \"Where do you come from?\" can have a LOT of racist undertone. You say she \"pretends\" to be from the UK and that she \"imitates\" a British accent... Have you considered the fact that her accent is simply changing after YEARS of living in the UK? People tend to adapt to their surrounding, she's not faking it, and it's rude of you to assume she is.\n\nYou sound like the kind of person who would ask a non-white person : \"No, but where are you  *really* from?\" if they say they are British, even if their family has been in the UK for more generations than yours in the US. She IS British. She comes from Britain. That's what her passport says, that's where she lives. She maybe even feels more British than Syrian. And even though you didn't say anything negative about Syria, the current situation is exactly what people will think of if you mention Syria and she might not want to discuss it.", "You make comments like \u201cmost of us had good, first world passports\u201d (which, BTW was entirely unrelated to the actual story) and can\u2019t see why someone in your group (I won\u2019t say friend because you\u2019re no friend to her) wouldn\u2019t want to be open about being Syrian?  Holy lack of self awareness Batman. \n\nFirstly- she doesn\u2019t want people like you bombarding her with your condescending questions and opinions about her heritage.  Secondly- she lives in the UK, she\u2019s a naturalised citizen now, **Newsflash** she ***is*** from the UK now.

You had 0 right to out her identity!", "YTA.   \n\n\nShe wasn't lying. She really does live in the UK, and since that's where she was visiting from, it is truthful to say that she's visiting from the UK.   \n\n\nWe have to assume that she was sick of answering questions about Syria, which has been in the news a lot. And that's totally understandable. There's a lot of resentment in Europe towards Syrian refugees, so your outing her as Syrian could have actually put her in danger.   \n\n\nYou've shown your true colors. You are thoughtless and think that other people's safety is a joke. You also think that you get to override other people's right to decide how they want to present themselves to strangers. Basically, you're dangerous. I wouldn't hang out with you either.", "YTA. You are from the US and don\u2019t understand something. Many people in Europe hate Syrians. After all the refugees came through all those years ago it ruined the reputation for all the immigrants from there. No wonder she won\u2019t tell people she is Syrian. It is probably for safety or so she doesn\u2019t have to deal with it.\n\nI had a friend who lived in the Persian Gulf during the Iraq war. He told everyone he was Canadian. That is an outright lie. Should people have called him out for it?", "When I ask where someone\u2019s from, I expect them to tell me every place they\u2019ve lived with dates.

You have no idea why she identifies in this way and similarly it's not your right to correct her, especially in front of other people.

So I say I'm from the UK, as I'm a naturalised citizen, and have lived here for half my life.\n\nAlso I'm from a small country that a lot of people haven't heard of, and I don't often feel like giving geography lessons.\n\nIf I'm talking more in depth, then I might mention my birthplace. \n\nAlso, it's not your place to volunteer someone else's personal information. They should control what they want people to know about them.", ">most of us had good 1st world passports we had to wait on one person from India to get visas and for another girl from Syria (27F) to naturalise here and get a UK passport.\n\nMaybe she feels insecure because her own group is judgmental folks who are so clear that they are from the \"first world\" and other poor folks have to work for their passport?

Never?\n\nIt is about what she identifies with - for example, having lived over half of my life in another country, I say that I am from that country.

Refugees are a big issue across western Europe.  You also have no idea what trauma she experienced in Syria. There are also several Syrian factions which might cause her issues if she announces her country of birth. Unfortunately not everyone who leaves a country leaves behind their conflicts. \n\nShe is not being dishonest. She lives in the UK and holds a UK passport. She is \"from\" the UK, at least now.

This could (at best) result in people making her uncomfortable and (at worst) put her in danger. I'm from one such country, having lived in many others (including the U.S. and U.K.). Whenever I travel, I carefully gauge the situation prior to answering the question: \"Where are you from?\" Often, I do not reveal my country of origin/birth.   \n\n\nWhy? Because it's not always safe for me to do so and sometimes I don't even want to take the chance of an unpleasant interaction. I've been spat at, harassed, and blamed on behalf of my country of birth, despite the fact that I haven't consistently lived there since I was 8 years old.   \n\n\nPolitical complexities aside, I'm proud of my culture and will happily share where I am from if I feel safe to do so. I've had many wonderful interactions with people who are kind and curious about my culture, but there's plenty of ignorance in the world and I've learned the hard way to be careful.   \n\n\nMoreover, your friend has gone through the immigration process, which is expensive and arduous. She is now as much from the UK as she is from Syria. It is her right to identify however the hell she pleases and not up to you to define her - she has earned that right. If she doesn't want to talk about her country of origin for whatever reason, it's not her job to do so. Safety aside, it can be exhausting to have to answer the same questions over and over again. There is also a level of psychological exhaustion with being from a place which has an ongoing conflict. She may have family or friends who are in danger; she may have concerns that she wants to forget about whilst she is on vacation. It's her right to want to discuss this or not, and it's not up to you to \"out\" her.   \n\n\nIf I were you, I'd issue a massive apology and never jump in to reveal someone's country of origin again.", "YTA big time for not respecting your friends' boundaries and calling her out like that in front of others.

What does your use of \"ethnic\" even mean here, given your laser-focus on \"Syrian\" everywhere else? People born in the UK to families that have been born in the UK for generations eat plenty of dishes from a wide range of different regions, countries and ethnicities.
