{"id": 29375, "submission_id": "17d6put", "title": "AITA for telling I am afraid to be obese to my obese SIL?", "selftext": "I(27F) was obese throughout my childhood and teenage years. It was because food was my comfort then. My obesity came with many health concerns. I was always sick, and I was so weak that I couldn't walk more than 30 minutes and I couldn't wear a padded coat because its weight made my shoulder hurt. I was 5.2ft and almost 200lbs. My health deteriorated really fast, so I decided to lose weight. I lost 90lbs but gained 35lbs because I had depression. It had nothing to do with diet, but it started because I was so stressed about my GPA in uni, and also was homesick. After I graduated, my depression didn't go away, and it was really tough years for me.\n\nI recently started to lose weight again, and surprisingly, eating healthy and going gym not only helped me lose 10lbs, but it saved me from depression. Later, my doctor told me one of my reasons for weight gain was related to depression and hormones, so losing weight was actually a good choice for my mental health, and encouraged me to stay fit.\n\nMy husband(28M) was such a blessing through all this. We married for a little over 1 year and dated for 2 years. He was a rock for all my hard times. He is actually from an unhealthy and obese family, and only one didn't come out as obese because he never liked eating, and enjoyed sports. He does not like eating because he has sensitive guts and some allergies.\n\nLast month, we went for a visit to my in-laws. I started intermittent fasting, which worked wonders for me. I didn't eat breakfast usually, so it was not really big deal for me. But it became a problem when I didn't eat late-night snacks at my in-law's house and went out jogging with my husband in the morning. My SIL(35F) accused me of being anorexic, which I'm definitely not. And she constantly called out me for fatphobia and anti-body positivity. She also said I was a bad influence on her kids(who are also morbidly obese, even at a young age.). It annoyed me, but I just let it slide.\u00a0\n\nBut then one of her teenage daughters, Lisa(15F) reached out to me, and asked if she could lose weight, too. Apparently, her mother said she should never bend to society's prejudice and lose weight, but Lisa disagreed. So I gave her some basic advice. Cut back on sugar intake including soda, juice, chocolate, and cookies. Eat more greens. Take a walk, and try to go gym, if she can. And I gave her some recipes for quick and delicious diet-friendly food. Simple salads, poke bowls, and some desserts.\n\nWhen my SIL heard it, she lost it. she called me some dirty names, and I should stop hating plus-size people, and work on my ED. I became so annoyed that I told her no, I don't hate overweight people, I respect them, but I am afraid of being obese because it is unhealthy in general, and it was personally damaging to my health and mentality. After that, basically, almost all my in-laws are telling me I'm in the wrong and should apologize and also get some therapy for my non-existent ED. I just don't know what to do. AITA?\n\nEdit) I made a mistake in writing. I did not lose 110lbs, but I was 110lbs at the end of my first diet.\n\nEdit 2)I just asked my questions about my SIL to my husband, and he also said she never liked him not eating larger portions, and also forced him to eat by not allowing him to go out and play if he did not finish his plate when she babysat him. (He was an elementary student) He also said to me he kinda has a suspicion that SIL had a problem with ED, but thought she overcame it by joining the body-positivity trend in recent years(she posts about it often), so never told me about it. He never thought his sister would act like this. He said he will ask his brother (MIL, FIL, SIL all live together in the same house and BIL lives nearby) what is exactly going on. He's on my side and thinks SIL's reaction was ridiculous, and so is his family's reaction. He said it's also not like their normal selves. He suspects they are coddling her because of her recent divorce.\n\nEdit 3) My in-laws are all objectively obese. This is something even they admit. They are all rather tall, men over 5.9ft, women 5.5ft, but they are all over 300lbs. And only one who actually called me fatphobic before SIL lost it was only SIL. She started to call me out when she heard I was planning on losing 5\\~10lbs. And I tend to never make comment about weight because well, I was obese for more than half of my life, and knows how much it could hurt.\n\nEdit) As for my health, before I lost weight, I had very low stamina and hardly moved. I am from East Asia, and as a student there, I spent 12+ hours sitting. My major problem was I had very little amount of muscle, even compared to other obese people. And I had rhinitis, which made things even more difficult.\n\nAlso, thanks for all the comments!\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1697906532, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17d6put/aita_for_telling_i_am_afraid_to_be_obese_to_my/", "score": 428, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And i understand that some people gain weight because something is wrong in their body, others by choice. And the weight is not a reason to judge people. \n\nWhat is a reason for judging is teaching your kids to be fat to show the society that its ok. As a parent you need to be responsible for your kids until they are old enough to make their own choices. Its the parents job to explain health risks of obesity.  So that when the kids grow up, they have all the knowledge to make the choice for theirselves.\n\nImagine if people would teach their kids to smoke because they think smoking is ok!

Your family could be concerned that you went from being obese most of the time they\u2019ve known you to underweight, and are now likely at a weight they view as perfect but are still going hard on weight loss. \n\nEven though it could be nothing, I\u2019d recommend seeing a therapist to make sure that your family\u2019s concerns are not valid.

You don't need to buy anything from anything from MLMs. \n\nIn fact, many endocrinologist support Keto. \n\nThere are good ways to do it and bad ways, regardless, you should mind your own business and stop spreading misinformation.", "Blink blink", "What\u2019s wrong with understanding the ratio of carbs fats and protein, and other nutrients on your labels?", "Lolwut?

Why does she have to spend every moment with the family and he doesn't?", "Here is a comparison for you: does smoking equal sick? No. Does everyone who smokes have lung cancer? No.\nYet, we all know that smoking is bad for you and increases the risk of cancer. If you don't have a lot of willpower, is it better to keep smoking without even trying to quit? No, you got to keep trying.\n\nIt's the same thing with obesity.

Extra adipose tissue (fat) can be the CAUSE of inflammation, hormonal imbalances, joint pain, limited mobility etc. \nSo yes, being obese is bad for you, even if you don't have any health problems yet. \nIt's like saying \"if smoking causes cancer, then how come not all smokers have lung cancer\"?

You go around spreading your \"\"knowledge\"\" because your wife is studying medicine.  \n\n\nYou know you don't know more than anyone else, right?

Mentioning her status as a med student is exactly intended to inform the reader than I'm not a doctor. \nNever claimed to be one. I just have access to someone with an insane amount of medical knowledge. As a result we talk and I learn things. So I probably do know more than most of you would.
