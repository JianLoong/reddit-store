{"id": 29375, "submission_id": "17d6put", "title": "AITA for telling I am afraid to be obese to my obese SIL?", "selftext": "I(27F) was obese throughout my childhood and teenage years. It was because food was my comfort then. My obesity came with many health concerns. I was always sick, and I was so weak that I couldn't walk more than 30 minutes and I couldn't wear a padded coat because its weight made my shoulder hurt. I was 5.2ft and almost 200lbs. My health deteriorated really fast, so I decided to lose weight. I lost 90lbs but gained 35lbs because I had depression. It had nothing to do with diet, but it started because I was so stressed about my GPA in uni, and also was homesick. After I graduated, my depression didn't go away, and it was really tough years for me.\n\n I recently started to lose weight again, and surprisingly, eating healthy and going gym not only helped me lose 10lbs, but it saved me from depression. Later, my doctor told me one of my reasons for weight gain was related to depression and hormones, so losing weight was actually a good choice for my mental health, and encouraged me to stay fit.\n\nMy husband(28M) was such a blessing through all this. We married for a little over 1 year and dated for 2 years. He was a rock for all my hard times. He is actually from an unhealthy and obese family, and only one didn't come out as obese because he never liked eating, and enjoyed sports. He does not like eating because he has sensitive guts and some allergies.\n\n Last month, we went for a visit to my in-laws. I started intermittent fasting, which worked wonders for me. I didn't eat breakfast usually, so it was not really big deal for me. But it became a problem when I didn't eat late-night snacks at my in-law's house and went out jogging with my husband in the morning. My SIL(35F) accused me of being anorexic, which I'm definitely not. And she constantly called out me for fatphobia and anti-body positivity. She also said I was a bad influence on her kids(who are also morbidly obese, even at a young age.). It annoyed me, but I just it slide.\u00a0\n\nBut then one of her teenage daughters, Lisa(15F) reached out to me, and if she could lose weight, too. Apparently, her mother said she should never bend to society's prejudice and lose weight, but Lisa disagreed. So I gave her some basic advice. Cut back on sugar intake including soda, juice, chocolate, and cookies. Eat more greens. Take a walk, and try to go gym, if she can. And I gave her some recipes for quick and delicious diet-friendly food. Simple salads, poke bowls, and some desserts.\n\n When my SIL heard it, she lost it. she called me some dirty names, and I should stop hating plus-size people, and work on my ED. I became so annoyed that I told her no, I don't hate overweight people, I respect them, but I am afraid of being obese because it is unhealthy in general, and it was personally damaging to my health and mentality. After that, basically, almost all my in-laws are telling me I'm in the wrong and should apologize and also get some therapy for my non-existent ED. I just don't know what to do. AITA?\n\nEdit) I made a mistake in writing. I did not lose 110lbs, but I was 110lbs at the end of my first diet.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1697906532, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17d6put/aita_for_telling_i_am_afraid_to_be_obese_to_my/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She would eat ricotta with a tablespoon and then go shopping and roam department stores shouting they hate fat girls because her larger size wasn't in the regulars section. YOU ARE NOT WRONG.

The society has gone mad with the fat promotion.\n\nI am chubby myself. Im not fat shaming here. And i understand that some people gain weight because something is wrong in their body, others by choice. And the weight is not a reason to judge people. \n\nWhat is a reason for judging is teaching your kids to be fat to show the society that its ok. As a parent you need to be responsible for your kids until they are old enough to make their own choices. Its the parents job to explain health risks of obesity.  So that when the kids grow up, they have all the knowledge to make the choice for theirselves.\n\nImagine if people would teach their kids to smoke because they think smoking is ok! And then at 18 your kid pretty much has no choice because they are addicted. Its no difference than giving your child diabetes (for life) at young age by overfeeding them with crap.", "NTA. On request, you gave the 15 year old some common advice that she could look up anywhere on the web. If this became long term one-on-one coaching, then it becomes a little greyer, because the kid isn't an adult yet, and the SIL might feel threatened by you taking this role in her daughter's life.", "NTA\n\nThat's a new one. Usually it's something like mentioning that being obese is extremely unhealthy that gets (wrongly) the \"fatphobic\" label. This person sounds *militantly* obese, as if she wants everyone else to be just like her.", "NTA. You took a responsible approach to diet and exercise, which is small, doable incremental changes that work for you. You recognized a problem and have been addressing it.

Your family could be concerned that you went from being obese most of the time they\u2019ve known you to underweight, and are now likely at a weight they view as perfect but are still going hard on weight loss. \n\nEven though it could be nothing, I\u2019d recommend seeing a therapist to make sure that your family\u2019s concerns are not valid.

Never missed an opportunity to tear me down. SIL seems like that kind of person.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. You answered your niece honestly and encouraged her in her determination to tackle a difficult issue. Of course people can be healthy and also considered obese.

If the family qualifies into obese and more, that's where it's into the land of medical issues, and has nothing to do with body image.\n\nI've struggled with weight myself in my life, still do.  I was at times Obese or worse (largest was over 280lbs, and I'm 5'8\"), and it took a ton of diet, exercise, and self-control to correct that, as well as continue maintaining it to this day (I'm in the 170lbs range now, but a lot more muscle).  I have a contributing medical issue of Type II Diabetes, so that's got it's own things that go with it.  All this is simply to say I get it and know how hard it is.\n\nThe niece asked for help, nothing you did OP was pushy, no comments were made that were negative about anyone else, there was no preaching about how they needed to change.  All the advice given was good, solid advice, nothing that would be an extreme, just ways to make healthier choices day-to-day.  I hope she feels comfortable coming to you, perhaps more privately, in the future.\n\nHonestly it sounds to me like SIL wants her family to be fat so she can not take responsibility for herself or her kids and has internalized shame, because who gets mad that someone you know and love wants to try and be healthier?
