{"id": 29375, "submission_id": "17d6put", "title": "AITA for telling I am afraid to be obese to my obese SIL?", "selftext": "I(27F) was obese throughout my childhood and teenage years. It was because food was my comfort then. My obesity came with many health concerns. I was always sick, and I was so weak that I couldn't walk more than 30 minutes and I couldn't wear a padded coat because its weight made my shoulder hurt. I was 5.2ft and almost 200lbs. My health deteriorated really fast, so I decided to lose weight. I lost 90lbs but gained 35lbs because I had depression. It had nothing to do with diet, but it started because I was so stressed about my GPA in uni, and also was homesick. After I graduated, my depression didn't go away, and it was really tough years for me.\n\nI recently started to lose weight again, and surprisingly, eating healthy and going gym not only helped me lose 10lbs, but it saved me from depression. Later, my doctor told me one of my reasons for weight gain was related to depression and hormones, so losing weight was actually a good choice for my mental health, and encouraged me to stay fit.\n\nMy husband(28M) was such a blessing through all this. We married for a little over 1 year and dated for 2 years. He was a rock for all my hard times. He is actually from an unhealthy and obese family, and only one didn't come out as obese because he never liked eating, and enjoyed sports. He does not like eating because he has sensitive guts and some allergies.\n\nLast month, we went for a visit to my in-laws. I started intermittent fasting, which worked wonders for me. I didn't eat breakfast usually, so it was not really big deal for me. But it became a problem when I didn't eat late-night snacks at my in-law's house and went out jogging with my husband in the morning. My SIL(35F) accused me of being anorexic, which I'm definitely not. And she constantly called out me for fatphobia and anti-body positivity. She also said I was a bad influence on her kids(who are also morbidly obese, even at a young age.). It annoyed me, but I just let it slide.\u00a0\n\nBut then one of her teenage daughters, Lisa(15F) reached out to me, and asked if she could lose weight, too. Apparently, her mother said she should never bend to society's prejudice and lose weight, but Lisa disagreed. So I gave her some basic advice. Cut back on sugar intake including soda, juice, chocolate, and cookies. Eat more greens. Take a walk, and try to go gym, if she can. And I gave her some recipes for quick and delicious diet-friendly food. Simple salads, poke bowls, and some desserts.\n\nWhen my SIL heard it, she lost it. she called me some dirty names, and I should stop hating plus-size people, and work on my ED. I became so annoyed that I told her no, I don't hate overweight people, I respect them, but I am afraid of being obese because it is unhealthy in general, and it was personally damaging to my health and mentality. After that, basically, almost all my in-laws are telling me I'm in the wrong and should apologize and also get some therapy for my non-existent ED. I just don't know what to do. AITA?\n\nEdit) I made a mistake in writing. I did not lose 110lbs, but I was 110lbs at the end of my first diet.\n\nEdit 2)I just asked my questions about my SIL to my husband, and he also said she never liked him not eating larger portions, and also forced him to eat by not allowing him to go out and play if he did not finish his plate when she babysat him. (He was an elementary student) He also said to me he kinda has a suspicion that SIL had a problem with ED, but thought she overcame it by joining the body-positivity trend in recent years(she posts about it often), so never told me about it. He never thought his sister would act like this. He said he will ask his brother (MIL, FIL, SIL all live together in the same house and BIL lives nearby) what is exactly going on. He's on my side and thinks SIL's reaction was ridiculous, and so is his family's reaction. He said it's also not like their normal selves. He suspects they are coddling her because of her recent divorce.\n\nEdit 3) My in-laws are all objectively obese. This is something even they admit. They are all rather tall, men over 5.9ft, women 5.5ft, but they are all over 300lbs. And only one who actually called me fatphobic before SIL lost it was only SIL. She started to call me out when she heard I was planning on losing 5\\~10lbs. And I tend to never make comment about weight because well, I was obese for more than half of my life, and knows how much it could hurt.\n\nEdit) As for my health, before I lost weight, I had very low stamina and hardly moved. I am from East Asia, and as a student there, I spent 12+ hours sitting. My major problem was I had very little amount of muscle, even compared to other obese people. And I had rhinitis, which made things even more difficult.\n\nAlso, thanks for all the comments!\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1697906532, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17d6put/aita_for_telling_i_am_afraid_to_be_obese_to_my/", "score": 740, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And i understand that some people gain weight because something is wrong in their body, others by choice. And the weight is not a reason to judge people. \n\nWhat is a reason for judging is teaching your kids to be fat to show the society that its ok. As a parent you need to be responsible for your kids until they are old enough to make their own choices. Its the parents job to explain health risks of obesity.  So that when the kids grow up, they have all the knowledge to make the choice for theirselves.\n\nImagine if people would teach their kids to smoke because they think smoking is ok!

Your family could be concerned that you went from being obese most of the time they\u2019ve known you to underweight, and are now likely at a weight they view as perfect but are still going hard on weight loss. \n\nEven though it could be nothing, I\u2019d recommend seeing a therapist to make sure that your family\u2019s concerns are not valid.

He has to regularly see a chiropractor for his back and had to do PT for his shoulders.  \n\nWeight is an extremely complex situation and needs to be addressed as such by both society and doctors. \n\nNeither of us have or had EDs. We ate plenty, we ate a variety of foods, we had even out eaten grown men with hard labor jobs. For anyone also struggling to gain weight, what works best for us, we eat 4 to 5 times a day, breakfast,  snack, lunch, snack, then dinner, sometimes another snack as well if we stay up late, and we eat a lot of protein, especially with our snacks. My favorite morning snack is a whole wheat tortilla roll up with almond butter and honey. I usually eat two, sometimes three if I've been super active. I usually eat a bit lighter in the afternoons, crackers, cheese and pickle slider things. My dietian at the time told me that eating multiple times a day is very healthy for both slowing down your metabolism and to speed it up.", "Not everyone works like that remember! Everyone is different and what you've gone through others haven't. I'm the latter as I truly never been hungry in the morning. Heck my whole family is unable to eat early until like 10 or 11am just getting close to brunch time. Just some water, juice or a tea is all I can do very early and then later maybe a sandwich idk. The only time I've actively ignored my hunger cues was during a tough time were we didn't have enough money to get us through the month let a lone a week of food and would starve for the most part of it. Having one, I can't even call it a meal, a day that was a little bit of rice and then just keep on drinking water to try ignore the hunger as we didn't have anything else. This went on for half a year before things got better. And it was the hardest too. So I definitely know the difference and definitely know this is just how I am in the morning.", "I guess we found one obese person in the comments spreading misinformation.\n\nObesity is illness like it or not and no healthy looking people didn't win some genetic lottery. They are putting in the work to feel better, happier and healthier than obese people.", "The option to put it in the refrigerator and eat it later exists.", "That you\u2019re not the only person that exists in the world and other realities can exist besides yours", "Also bad for non-corn farmers. Take it from someone who works on an Illinois produce farm...", "Obesity does actually directly cause many health issues. Fat tissue is metabolically and hormonally active, it's not just inert tissue, and it directly causes inflammation; chronic inflammation is very very bad for you. Not to mention the joint problems that are caused not just by the excess weight and pressure, but by the inflammation.", "The point is they made it to 80 years old, guess what happened to the obese people before then?", "You're delusional I'm afraid.", "Ok show us some proof of your claims.\n\nAn obese person suffering from health issues due to their weight is likely to be told to try and lose some, rightly so.", "I\u2019m not making up lies. And you do mean to imply that I should lose weight by saying that I couldn\u2019t possibly be healthy because of my weight. And honestly, I don\u2019t owe you an explanation. Metabolically healthy obese people are real and are not rare. Or you could go join a running group on Facebook or Nextdoor. You will see that there are people of all shapes and sizes who run and are healthy. You might learn something and grow as a person. The group I am running with now have taught me a lot about loving my body exactly as it is. We are all currently preparing for the Wine & Dine half marathon at WDW in less than 2 weeks.", "Who's taking personally? It's indiscriminate and dumb, two non conflicting concepts", "100% same! I don't usually eat breakfast, but I love breakfast foods. I frequently eat them for lunch or dinner. Oatmeal is one of my go-to comfort foods on a bad day, but I can't stomach anything that heavy early in the morning.", "Don\u2019t bother arguing with u/focusfaster he is an absolute moron \ud83d\ude02", "You missed the two more bites part. If it\u2019s alot of food, obviously i save it. It\u2019s when i\u2019m down to just two or three more bites, not enough to save but it feels wasteful to throw it away. I\u2019ve gotten better once I recognized where the issue came from, it\u2019s easer to control.", "I empathize. Most folks don\u2019t realize how much ag industry we have here in CA. \nIt would take a political sea change and iron will to change subsidies and somehow protect livelihoods while requiring higher standards for our foods. \nCan produce farmers be subsidized so fresh fruits and veggies are less expensive? I don\u2019t know the answers but I think it\u2019s one aspect of addressing the societal failures you mentioned, which in turn can help combat the epidemic in higher poverty/food desert areas where highly processed food is much easier to get and much cheaper as well.", "Cancer is not the only negative thing about smoking for body.\n\nBy smoking your lungs are losing capacity and you'll get out of breath easily. Your teeth are getting damaged and it can affect you body overall.", "You are making up lies. Absolutely. How many calories are you eating that you are so physically active that you maintain such a heavy weight? \n\nYou are not healthy at 275 lbs. I imagine you would be morbidly obese if you are as short as you are claiming. \n\nYou can lie on the internet, but you can\u2019t lie to your body about your activity and your caloric intake.", "Can you explain why so many people who eat a ketogenic diet are not dying every day? How do they survive if their brain \u201cabsolutely needs sugar\u201d?\n\nLook up what a ketone is. Do a little research before coming here spewing bullshit and saying \u201cit\u2019s literally science\u201d.", "Fair enough! I\u2019m the type to save the two bites though. It never seems like not enough to save", "\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "By all means imagine away. You aren\u2019t the first unqualified stranger to think I have to prove my value by going over my medical history and food behaviors and you won\u2019t be the last. Be blessed.", "I have done it  bur then i be mad disappointed when i go to reheat it.", "So she's not a doctor? Did you know we all have access to an 'insane amount of medical knowledge' on the internet? The consensus of all of this knowledge is that you are wrong. One med student does not know more than the entirety of medical professionals and studies available to us.\n\n Why would every doctor everyone replying to you has talked to and all collective research be wrong but your med student wife and 'thefatdoctoruk' be right?", "She is a med student... I hate to break it to you, but she doesn't have an insane amount of medical knowledge. She isn't even a resident yet - and I help train residents, and they can't even correctly make a medical plan for our ICU patients. \n\nI hope she isn't as unaware of what she doesn't know as you are. If she goes into residency with the attitude you have, she will fail miserably."]}
