I kept pestering him to change the date of his outing, it wasn\u2019t even something that had to be booked so I told him to go another day and come to the recital.

I get that you don\u2019t want your kids to be disappointed by your ex. That said: you have to let him make his own decisions. If he bails, be there for your kids. You absolutely cannot change your ex\u2019s behavior. It sucks (trust me I know) but it\u2019s his failure. Don\u2019t take it on yourself. Don\u2019t bad mouth your ex to the kids (but totally vent to someone who won\u2019t tell the kids). Your ex is an adult. Picking up the pieces for him SUCKS.

That\u2019s a very shitty thing to do as a parent.", "NTA, all the E-SH's are missing the point that you're advocating for your children because he's actions WILL harm them", "OP probably told him to be at the recital since kids asked and they cannot be there together, so she does need confirmation that he is going. Given he originally agreed to be there and then backed out a good bit later, pressing him on missing it does not make you the A H. Also telling him to be there doesn\u2019t make her the A H either. even if she told him to go he could have still said he was not able to go and ask her to go instead at that time. Changing his mind later and getting no flack at all is not okay. Also if she didn\u2019t say anything it would be enabling his behavior.

You are NTA for wanting to spare your kids\u2019 feelings and trying to make their wishes come true. Absolutely NTA for that. Unfortunately, you are a little for pestering after he told you his new plans. His new plans suck, don\u2019t get me wrong, but if he wants to ruin his relationship with his kids, let him. It\u2019s not your responsibility anymore to make all the interactions pleasant between your kids and their dad and the best thing you can do is be present for them whenever you can be. You don\u2019t need to make excuses for him, but I would steer clear from being too blunt about how this went down either.

She provided all the info that we need. As long as their co-parenting plan works for them and the children, it's none of our business. \n\nMaybe they can't help but argue if they're around each other, so for the kids' sake they've made this \"one at a time\" plan. That's way better than the kids seeing them fight. Who knows? But it seems like it works. \n\nAnd regardless, the dad agreed to go. He should be there. If whoever he is dating disagrees, then he shouldn't be dating someone who won't put his children first.", "This sounds like there's a restraining order, I agree.", "[deleted]", "Honestly I bet she heard the date and was like \"but I wanted to go (insert random less important thing), forget about your kids recital there will be another one.\"", "He can be there but is choosing not to. He had at least a week's notice if not more and then decided to make the date for the outing on the day of the kid's show knowing the date and knowing the kids wanted him there.  If everything is to be believed from OP's statement he is an AH.", "Exactly. Found the girlfriend", "Not her problem. I sucks because nobody wants their babies to be upset. But you can't control the other person and the sooner OP figures that out the better off she will be. Love on the babies 2x as hard", "I agree ESH. OP isn't her ex's mother. He's not going and there's no point arguing with him. Honestly the whole thing sounds like a mess.", "So you think that once you get a divorce you have 0 commitments to your children? Wth. Also people don't get replaced like Legos, these kids don't want a \"father figure\" to be at the recital. They want their father, which he committed to being there.\n\nI'm sure his new gf means a lot to him, but why exactly does her date need to be scheduled on the same day of your other commitments? And why can't he communicate with her about the needs of his children and that he wants them to be there. He raised those kids for several years and yet doesn't love them enough to actually commit to them?\n\nBut I don't think any of this matters to you. You sound really bitter towards this woman and are using this as a way to confirm some bias you have against women who get divorced or custody. Divorce is not a single person action, divorce is a consequence of a bad relationship. And I think it's probably a consequence of this guy being unwilling to commit to his own children.\n\nAs far as you're concerned this man has no accountability for his own commitments, his children and his own schedule.", "What hell is wrong with you?", "> Imagine if I as the business owner complained about an employee missing a shift they said they would definitely make. Then I blame them for not showing up. No, I\u2019m responsible for not coming up with an back up.\n\nIt\u2019s called a no call/no show, and employees not only get blamed for it, but fired for it.  Whatever point you were trying to make (something about personal accountability but also that the kids\u2019 dad doesn\u2019t have any because the parents are divorced?), that analogy is not making it.", "\u201cImagine if I as the business owner complained about an employee missing a shift they said they would definitely make.

An Order For Protection has no bearing on whether the father cancels his date to go to his CHILDREN\u2019s recital!", "I think it matters. I think it\u2019s relevant to OP\u2019s credibility.", "Why? It has nothing to do with the question. Courts made a custody order, you have to follow it", "Not all Domestic Violence towards the wife or girlfriend only stops fathers from seeing their children.

Assuming something no one said. \n\nYou and I have very different definitions for that word. Encourage. \n\nAnd they've clearly already been to court. At least enough for some authority to make them not be in public with each other.

She wants him to go, so she won't have to, because she's bothered by him dating, or maybe because she's jealous he is getting to go out.", "I never said he wasn't. I just never said he was because I don't pass asshole judgements on people without hearing THIER side. The subs call r/ am I THE asshole, not r/is my clearly deadbeat BD the asshole.

So they should get used to the ex-partner being a minority part of their life.\n\nI'm being objective and my philosophy is to take accountability.  Reddit hates that.\n\nThis is a simple request to fulfill.  Most ex partners would be able to fulfill this if they separated on good terms.  Or if the fault was heavily weighed toward the ex-partner.  It sounds like it wasn't.\n\nAlso, I'm looking at the long-term solution.  The truth is, that their kids will not see the ex 70% of the time.  It's really up to the parents to relay that expectation to them.  If the ex missed this event, then he will likely miss other events.  So, I'm giving hard advice to help the kids be happy and putting the onus on the parents.

I suffered DV and my ex is not allowed to be near me physically has to remain in his vehicle at all drop offs and pick ups.

Rapists can sue for custody - or even partial custody of children born from that event. Not every place takes into consideration every detail. Supervised custody isn't always a requirement from states if the spouse only exhibited abuse towards their spouse and not the children - then situations like what I mentioned. I doubt that's the case since she does have contact with him, but it would be a reason for them to be unable to be around each other. Also the apps are something that have only become popular the last several years. If these two have been divorced for years it's possible that they divorced before it became popular and just never got it because they had figured out some system."]}
