We both work in the same industry and our jobs require us to work long hours everyday. When we first moved in together nearly 5 years ago, I realized I was waking up feeling quite irritated and exhausted, because he would snore very loudly all night. 5 years forward, I can't deal with this anymore. He was away for 2 weeks for work and I was able to sleep very well. Because we're both under a lot of pressure in our jobs, if i'm not able to relax and sleep at night, I tend to clench my jaw. And since I also have an autoimmune condition, if i'm not able to sleep well, my hair falls, I have daily headaches, feel stressed and exhausted and many other symptons. It impacts my life a lot. However, these past 2 weeks while he was away, I was able to sleep like a baby. It was even pointed out to me how I was looking well and relaxed. Now, last night he came back and I was up ALL night until 5am when I woke him up and said I couldn't sleep. He got angry and went to the sofa. I then managed to sleep a few hours before my shift. However, when he woke up this morning, he was extremely upset and said I owed him an apology. I suggested multiple times in the past that we alternate between the sofa bed and our bed, just so we both can get some sleep. He refuses. He says if we were to do this is best we break up and insists I should wear ear plugs. I tried wearing ear plugs already but I have small ears and even the small plugs hurt me..and as a side sleeper, it's even less comfortable. He thinks i'm not wearing them right. At this point i'm simply too exhausted and I don't wanna go back to feeling like crap everyday because I can't sleep. It makes me feel very anxious.

I ended up sleeping alone, and have done for along time.  It caused some arguments, and it did not help with my insomnia (that's a whole different story).\n\nLack of sleep causes mistakes, damage, injuries, poor mental state, as well as a lot of health problems.  You needing a full nights rest is important.\n\nEar plugs do dampen some of the sound, and don't drown out all of the sound, also when your both in bed his head will be about 3-4 feet apart, so ear plugs might not fully help.  Snoring can be very loud, anywhere between 50db-100db (anything from a normal conversation to motorcycle).  Ear plugs don't dampen the vibrations of someone snoring, and some people can be very vibrating in there sleep.\n\nYour partner can not control his snoring, but he can take actions to help with this, but sounds like he is putting the onus on you to sort it out, when in reality both of you deserve a good nights sleep.\n\nYour both deserve a good night sleep, and if you both cant do something about it, and the way he feels, then it might be wise to part ways.  However, your partner, might find himself very alone in a bed either way, because people tend to need sleep.\n\nRemember this, you deserve to be able to sleep, you deserve to not feel anxious all the time, you deserve not to have headaches all the time, and that's for starters.

I've trained myself not to sleep in those positions and am doing a 5-year course of allergy shots.  I'm also trying to lose weight.  I'm not planning on surgery to fix the deviated septum since my ENT doesn't believe it's a major factor ahead of the allergies.
