If he wants a ride he can walk up to your house at your leaving time (if you need to leave earlier so you can drop off your furry friend he needs to be there at that time). You are doing him a favour. Not the other way around. If he works other hours he needs to ask for the same hours or he has to wait for you to finish work.

He can take the bus/public transportation like the rest of us.", "NTA. It\u2019s hard though. I once got voluntold / conned into giving a guy a lift to work who lived in our block and worked the same site as me.

On your work schedule?", "NTA - it is common politeness to 1. make arrangements far ahead of time, 2. to contribute towards gas for the vehicle, and 3. to not abuse the privilege by forcing yourself on people constantly. A solid 4. would be THANKING the person who politely gave you a lift.\n\nDude is rude, cheap, and entitled. He can find a new way to work. And btw, you do not owe him any explanations. \"No.\" is a full sentence and he can look for a job he can get to by bus, train, or someone else's vehicle.", "NTA. And it's pretty presumptuous of him to just assume that you're available to drop everything to give him a ride everyday. It's not your responsibility to ensure he arrives to work when his.

If you want to be nice, I would give him your schedule in advance and let him know that he can come to your house if he wants a ride on your schedule.

Not your responsibility and since he isn't contributing in any way why would you do him a favour?", "NTA as he emailing nonsense about you and refusing to talk to you at the moment, continue his momentum of not speaking to each other and ignore him as he ignores you.
