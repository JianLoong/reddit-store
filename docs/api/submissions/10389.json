I told her that if she is concerned about having these conditions, we should seriously go to a mental health professional to get her evaluated. However, she always refuses to go to a doctor because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t need someone else\u2019s validation.\u201d I told her it\u2019s not about validation\u2014 it\u2019s about finding resources and help to let you live a better life and cope with your struggles. She still refuses. (I know many people struggle in long lines and waits to get mental health diagnoses, or sometimes are not taken seriously. That\u2019s not the case for us, we have great mental health resources available and clinics nearby, and enough money to afford an evaluation.)\n\nNowadays, my wife uses her self-diagnosed conditions to get out of her responsibilities. She recently stopped doing her share of chores because her \u201cADHD is so distracting\u201d and it just stresses her out too much to fight it. We were making cupcakes for her niece\u2019s birthday, and I frosted them in purple instead of blue while she was in the bathroom. She made me scrape off the frosting and redo it because apparently it was triggering her OCD, and when I tried to tell her it wasn\u2019t a big deal, she got upset at me for belittling her mental health.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve never accused my wife of lying to take advantage of the situation because I want to give her the doubt. Maybe she genuinely does have something going on, or maybe she just doesn\u2019t understand that mental health disorders aren\u2019t trivial personality traits.\n\nHowever, we were at a family reunion at my sister\u2019s house, and I was talking with my sister, her husband, and my wife. My sister has struggled with debilitating seasonal affective disorder and seasonal depression since childhood. I asked her how her new light box therapy was working, and she told me she\u2019s seen some improvements. My wife jumped in and said that she has seasonal depression too, and all my sister needs to do is drink more caffeine and power through the day, because that\u2019s what worked for her. My sister kind of uncomfortably laughed her off and said thanks for the suggestion, but I could tell she was a little upset because we were having a serious conversation when my wife jumped in to say that. \n\nMy wife got a little pressed and told my sister to not laugh her off and take her seriously if she wants to improve her condition as a fellow survivor. This comment pissed me off, and I told my wife to please stop talking about her undiagnosed mental health issues in public, because we don\u2019t even have confirmation that she really has seasonal affective disorder. My wife acted shocked that I said this and stopped talking to me for the rest of the evening. When we got home, she blew up at me for trying to damage her reputation in public and making her seem like a liar.

If that\u2019s the case, then she needs professional help to figure out how to take ownership of her conditions instead of making other people responsible for managing them for her!  Making you redo cupcakes because it upset her OCD is a prime example of this: she made *you* responsible for her condition, while she did nothing herself.  Same with not doing chores because her ADHD is too bad.  She is making everyone around her (mainly you in these examples) take responsibility for managing her symptoms, instead of getting help and figuring ways to manage them herself.", "As the parent of someone who really does have diagnosed ADHD, severe anxiety and severe depression which almost cost their lives, I find this behavior reprehensible and vile.\n\nI get that these are strong words.  And I am very very happy that we can talk about mental health in the open with out the same stigmas if even a decade ago.\n\nBut for some like your wife, these disorders are like a badge of honor used for attention.  If she really had the disorders she said she did as badly as she indicated and left untreated, she would find it hard to leave the house and interact with society.  So I get angry when people like your wife use real disorders as buzz phrases to get attention or get what they want.  Real people struggle with real problems every day and your wife makes them into characters.\n\nNTA but this is your hill to die on.  She lacks empathy for those who are truly suffering and is pushing you around with it too.  Force her to get an evaluation or run away from this relationship.  It\u2019s not going to get better.", "Oh, gods... NTA. Your wife needs psychological help, stat. This is attention-seeking behavior that could become very toxic, especially for any children you may have around you.", "No it seems your wife\u2019s appropriation of psychological disorders she\u2019s not diagnosed as having in order to gain advantage or social standing would put her solidly in AH country. \n\nSo NTA but get her help because something is going on for sure.", "NTA. Wow her behavior is alarming. I have anxiety, mild OCD, and have suffered from depression on and off for 15 years. While these are things I am afflicted with, it is still up to me to get the proper medical treatment to deal with these. They aren\u2019t crutches for escaping responsibility. They aren\u2019t excuses to be an AH. The fact that she thinks seasonal depression can be cured with caffeine and bootstrap mentality would be laughable if it wasn\u2019t so disturbing.", "NTA.

I definitely didn\u2019t talk about it to others and I know from support groups the vast amount of people dealing with that issue feel the same. There\u2019s a difference between being diagnosed and pridefully saying \u201cI can deal with this\u201d and boasting about a debilitating mental illness. Your wife is clearly doing the latter and it\u2019s honestly really insulting. \n\nI\u2019m concerned that she\u2019s actually suffering in some way because healthy and happy people don\u2019t suddenly start faking mental illness. Her flippant nature about getting diagnosed shows you everything you need to know about those specific illnesses but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not sick in some other way.

She is not a professional. She might have an \"educated guess\" about her issues. But no concrete diagnosis. Even if she was a professional, it is a cardinal rule for a psychologist/psychiatrist to never diagnose/treat oneself. And the most basic thing that one learns in university is that each person will need a personalized set of coping mechanisms, treatments, etc. Seasonal depression is a blanket term in the sense that it affects every person differently. Just because one thing worked for her, doesn't mean it will work for others.   \n\n\nI would have said ESH if you didn't encourage her previously to get a proper diagnosis and she decided not to.", "NTA.

Her behaviour is really insensitive and insulting to those who actually suffer from those illnesses.", "NTA but stop enabling her. She's feeding off the attention, don't give it to her. She most definitely is taking advantage of the situation. She's lives to rock the boat, and she has all of you doing what ever it takes to keep it steady. STOP.  Yes your hill to die on is her getting some sort of formal diagnosis. She is refusing to go because then she will no longer be able to use it as an excuse to do what she doesn't want to do.

Your sister was visibly uncomfortable with the way she over-stepped and all you did was try to stop this awkward situation from getting worse. This overly-defensive reaction is *not* a good look on her.\n\nWhile your wife has every right to refuse to seek professional help, she also needs to understand her behaviour isn't okay and that people will come to less than complimentary conclusions about her based on that, regardless of whether you are there.", "Nta but she need some kind of intervention and actual diagnosis which properly isn't going to be any of the diagnosis she given herself.

In the event the cold symptoms do not improve with home treatment, your wife should seek professional input. \n\nIt is NOT the responsibility of everyone around her to make sure to step away and cover their own faces in anticipation of her coughs and sneezes. It is NOT the responsibility of anyone else in the home to throw away her snot- laden tissues. And while it is not the responsibility of anyone else to make sure a spouse or adult family member is taking medications on schedule and following up with a doctor (for colds or mental health), I do think it is a supportive and proactive thing to do in a relationship, and when the symptomatic individual both rebuffs these supports AND continues to use the symptoms of their self- diagnosed condition as an excuse for behaving poorly to others ... well. \n\nLet's just say I'm not doubting her claims about her mental health. I'm just doubting her ability to self- treat.", " \ud83c\udfb6Somebody come get her she's acting like a victim\ud83c\udfb6\n\nMy niece does similar.

That could be some form of therapy, or pharmaceutical, or a combination. The point is that until shes sought advice from a properly trained professional, you dont know. \n\nA diagnosis would also help in terms of getting reasonable adjustments at work. In my case, reasonable adjustments is simply a case of my colleagues understanding that I might need a bit of extra thinking time if my anxiety is playing up and having additional check-ins with my manager. I've also got a risk assessment in place for stress and anxiety. I've also worked with my manager to find a way of working that helps to relieve the pressure on days when the anxiety is starting to become an issue. There are other days where, try as I might, it still gets the better of me. The same applies at home.

The point of getting formal diagnoses is to assist you in managing your mental health; declaring you have a disorder, without a formal diagnosis, just makes it harder for the rest of us to be taken seriously when we need assistance.

My advice to that is to try to go to another after looking up reviews. My personal experiences with ones like that weren\u2019t too bad. With it I met every quotient to be diagnosed with ADHD as an adult (as said even by the one administering my exam). We did a few auditory and visual things and then a computer program that switched through tasks and would monitor my response time and also would record when I looked away from the screen. She didn\u2019t diagnose me that day. In the office she told me it was because I smoke weed (medically. But hadn\u2019t at all that day) and on my paperwork she said it was because I had good grades as a kid so like technically I haven\u2019t been diagnosed adhd but like I\u2019m obviously adhd on the attention side. The other was after a doctor had diagnosed me with ptsd and I denied that diagnosis without actually looking it up and just assumed it was too bad of a condition for me to have.

Months later I finally looked up the ptsd entry in the dsm 5 and I hit every single category except for the nature of the trauma. Mine was emotional which the dsm 5 leaves little room for unless you do what that first doctor did and take it as \u201cit threatened the *way* you live your life which in a way is a threat to your life\u201d. I\u2019ve learned after moving and seeing another doctor or two that that\u2019s apparently how a lot go about diagnosing emotional based ptsd because many studies do show equal if not greater links in the severity of emotional vs physical trauma", "Sounds like Munchausens (a condition where someone fakes being sick to get sympathy and attention from others), mixed in with narcissism.", "It took me years of finding the courage to get diagnosed, or at least seek out what was wrong with me (ptsd) because I was filled with shame.

If she thought that she had cancer she\u2019d go to the doctor and get diagnosed, right? Same with any other medical condition. Using the acknowledgement and empathy of others to get what she wants is not okay. Especially if she won\u2019t do anything to try and help herself. If she has a health condition and refuses to try to care for herself you need to decide if you want to handle all of it for her. No one wants to be depressed or anxious or traumatized. Unfortunately, at this point you want her to be better more than she does and it won\u2019t ever work that way (in my experience.)", "This clearly needs to happen, how about you try to take it from the standpoint that you want to learn how to better support her with these conditions.  Or marriage counseling to deal with them (because any professional that you can get her to go to is going to work out these self-diagnosis things).  If she won't go, you go, to get the help and support you need.  She'll probably hate that more and maybe dial it back, or at least you can get some tools to try to communicate through it and set boundaries.  (People with ADHD need consequences and tools, not free passes).", "Also any kids future or present will almost certainly develop at least one of her \u201cdisorders\u201d (in quotations because her behavior really doesn\u2019t come off as someone that actually has those disorders.

Just most actually mentally ill people will recognize that what worked for their body won\u2019t always work for someone else so the specific way she doubled down on her recommendation is what really rubs me the wrong way). But it\u2019s known that kids replicate the behavior they see. If they have an anxious parent, they will likely become anxious as well because they see their parent stressing over it and it actually rewires that anxiety into their brain. So if she\u2019s playing these symptoms whether she actually feels them or not, she may make the little ones that she\u2019s around frequently *actually* feel that way. Willing to give her the benefit of the doubt that maybe she does actually have conditions or tendencies and maybe she\u2019s just so over the moon with finding this about herself and having words for it. That happens. There\u2019s just a fine line where it seems like that or seems like a fake mentally ill trying to pretend that maybe she accidentally crossed in her enthusiasm. But she needs to get help if she does have those issues. If her adhd is so bad she can\u2019t do household chores, then she needs medication because her job won\u2019t be far behind. Or at least some form of a treatment plan.
