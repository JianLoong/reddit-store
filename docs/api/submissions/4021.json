She doesn\u2019t have kids of her own. \n\nMy siblings and I bickered throughout the trip as normal, over petty shit siblings fight over. My dad\u2018s gf was appalled at this and scolded us every time. At one point she even said \u201cI can\u2019t deal with this\u201d and walked out of the restaurant bc my brother and I were debating politics. It wasn\u2019t hostile, just a heated discussion.

She went out with my dad and wanted it to be \u201cjust the two of them\u201d but then flipped when me and my sister wanted to go out because \u201chow could my dad let us go after our behavior\u201d.  Or when my phone died at their hotel and instead of calling me an Uber to get home, she told me to stand on the curb (in freezing weather) and get myself a cab at 2 am. The last night they were here was my final straw. \n\nThey ran out of beers at the concession stand at a concert we\u2019d gone to, so I told them I was going up to the next level to get a beer. His gf goes \u201cReally? Why can\u2019t you just enjoy the show without having to drink?\u201d I\u2019d drank 1 beer; she was on #4. I lost my shit. I got into her face and asked her \u201c(Name) why are your eyes so red? Maybe you\u2019re the one that needs to hold off on the drinks. Please stay in your place and stop trying to control me, a 26 year old.\u201d My dad was livid and told me to apologize. I told him I think his gf is a bitch and a phony, I\u2019m not sorry, and went back to my seat. \n\nMy dad isn\u2019t speaking to me until I apologize. I\u2019m coming home soon for Christmas. I plan on staying w my mom. I want my dad to be in my life, but I don\u2019t like his gf one bit.

When you took it too far you lost your credibility with your objections and alienated your father. \nYou don\u2019t have to apologize for what you said to her, but you should apologize for getting in her face.
