Am I the asshole for refusing to babysit for a girlfriend while her husband is home. They have been married 5 years and the child is now 2. The child goes between 2 other sitters and myself for 14/16hr days while she works and Hubby works 12 hr days. I watch the two yr old at their home bc I have dogs and cats and they both don't like animals (my animals get on the furniture and they don't like the hair). Recently I've watch the kid and dads been home not working (2/3days a week since memorial day). I didnt ask due to its personal issue that doesn't technically involve me. My problem is he expects me to do things his way like pick up a toy after the child drops it even tho the child may go back to it a minute later. He gets angry when the child wants to hang out with him in the bedroom with him but will be upset if I tell the child no and let them scream. So I messaged my friend and said after this week I will no longer be watching the child bc if dad is home not working he can watch the child and do things his way. I don't expect a message back untill she is on her way home. Should I unsend it or stick to my guns\n\nEdit.

When dads home he wants nothing to do the with the child.

Then he can just do them himself", "NTA. You're never at fault for not taking a job.", "Why would you put up with this?  This sounds like a terrible job and situation.  People always need childcare and at like $2-3 per hour that you charge, you will surely find another job asap.  Quit.  This situation sounds annoying.", "Wow, I feel so bad for the child. Dont ever babysit for these people again. They will continue to act this way if you continue to babysit for them", "Oh this is heartbreaking. Poor kid.", "$30 a day. That's what they pay the other sitters as well", "It is perfectly reasonable to set conditions for rendering services.  Both businesses and independent contractors do it allll the time.", "Didn\u2019t see any mention of payment.", "NAH. I mean, that's very low, but you agreed to it.\n\nYou're just quitting a bad job, that's all, not a big deal.", "Yup. Free market. Either side can bail out. I wasn\u2019t siding with either of them. If they expect too much, say bye.", "Who would do that for free?", "Oh ya I have no trouble with the pay.", "OP is setting a condition for rendering services, which is a very normal thing to do.  They can accept the condition or not.  OP doesn\u2019t have to skip straight to refusing the job, and it\u2019s weird and pushy to tell them that those are their only options, which is exactly what you did.", "they said it was their friend idk I\u2019ve read stories where friends did more than this for free.", "It sounds like a crummy job.  I'd be frustrated too.\n\nRegarding the message... well, I hope it doesn't come across as rude or passive aggressive.  Assuming you want to keep this friend, try to keep it professional.  You may want to change the message to something else instead.  Take out the reason for you quitting.  Giving the reason sounds like a personal jab at her and her husband.\n\nJust say you're sorry but you've found other work, don't have the time anymore, want to do other things, etc.", "I didn\u2019t do anything. I just said it\u2019s a free market and, if the juice isn\u2019t worth the squeeze, find another fruit. I think OP is in the right for bailing.

If the job sucks and it\u2019s not what you signed up for, don\u2019t do it", "You\u2019re right, it\u2019s doesn\u2019t explicitly say there\u2019s a financial transaction. I implied it based on the edit where they say the HAVE to stay after the husband gets home.", ">Just say you're sorry but you've found other work, don't have the time anymore, want to do other things, etc\n\nWhile I agree that if OP wants to keep the friendship, maybe it would be best to avoid a direct jab at the friend's husband, I wouldn't lie about the reason - maybe just show another side of the truth.\n\n\"Dear Friend,    \nStarting next week, I will no longer be available to babysit for your child due to my need to focus on my mental wellbeing.    \nI wish you the best of luck.    \nHugs,    \nOP\"\n\nETA: NTA", "Ooo fair enough, I took that more as the husband is just incompetent and can\u2019t be left alone with the child even for an hour.", "Yeah I was just referring to this initial message.  OP could give the reasons if pressed, or at a later time.  But right now seems like the wrong time.", "Hahaha uhhh I think that goes without saying. Dude seems like a real piece of work.

Yikes", "Why wasn't your relationship with your girlfriend's children from other partners part of your discussion when you started your relationship?", "NTA  Run from these people.

Stick to your guns OP.", "Stick to your guns.  You're the babysitter.  It is very difficult to properly do your job if dad is there getting in the way.  He needs to keep his mouth shut & mind his own business, bc during that time the kids are not his business unless he is watching them.  NTA.  It sounds like a very uncomfortable situation to be in & I certainly wouldn't do it.", "NTA, but i would unsend an change it. Just tell her hubbys present makes you uncomfortable and you will not babysit any longer when he is present. \n\nAnd leave out the part that he should watch them.

That's only $2 per hour before taxes \ud83d\ude32\n\nI also wonder why your friend and her husband chose to have a child when they are extremely busy and have no time to actually raise the child...\n\nOn topic. NTA for not wanting to work a paid babysitting job that makes you uncomfortable. You're her friend, but in this situation you're her hired babysitter. That's a professional role. You need to talk with her and tell you aren't able to provide your babysitting services anymore when her husband is home because of irreconcilable differences regarding childcare expectations and working conditions.", "Info:\n\n\nAre you being paid?\n\nAnd I assume this woman is your \"girlfriend\" in a platonic fashion.\n\n\nAssume this is a platonic girlfriend and you are not being paid you are in no way an asshole.\n\n\nAssuming you're sleeping with this guy's wife while being paid to take care of his kids then you are an asshole.", "NTA.
