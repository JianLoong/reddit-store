Why is it ok to say British food is awful?", "I mean what British food are you eating?", ">he refuses to cook since it\u2019s a woman\u2019s job in his mind\n\nHe\u2019s out of his mind then. Many great chefs are/were men, going back to antiquity. Even looking just at tv chefs there\u2019s as many men as women", "There was a time where boiled skinless chicken breasts and hot sauce was a common lunch for my older brother and I and it wasn\u2019t bad-wasn\u2019t great either but yea", "Watch uncle Rogers criticism of her", "I mean if you don't want this stop saying British food is bad, or at least defending the position?", "I lived in Louisiana for a few years and quickly learned about the \"holy trinity.\"", "I am a New England girl - there's some awesome food up here as well. But NOLA has a food history centuries long with some special local ingredients that have limited availablity.\n\nFunny story was I visited NOLA and was listening to live jazz - because that's what you do ;) A local came up to me who had a bit of a buzz going - I don't drink, but I don't judge. He asked where I was from, I said Boston - because no matter where you live, everyone in the world knows Boston - lol! He started ranting about how lobsters were awful - the most boring bland dish ever! Crawdads in hot sauce were the way! While I admit that crawdads in hot sauce are awesome, I refused to agree that lobster was awful - I mean folks from all over the world ship it in as a top delicacy! We finally agreed to disagree, another regular came over after the fact and noted that lobster actually was pretty special, but the local boys gotta support the local dishes ;)", "Food def don't suck in NOLA. I follow a guy in IG reels, and his saying get's me. \"If you ain't sneezin', it ain't seasoned\". Currently reside in TX, and for all the negatives here, TX barbecue is def some of the best. And seasoning is not an issue. It may be simple SPG(salt pepper garlic) on a slab of meat, or it could include paprika, cumin, onion, oregano, cayenne(thanks Louisiana). If your 'cue needs sauce, it ain't seasoned right."]}
