Might just be selective but it means that foods with minimal flavour or food they eat often. Changing their diet dramatically so quickly will incur issues. For that reason it may be important for her to remain on her current diet. I did meet someone with this issue who would only eat plain chicken, rice and veg, none of it seasoned.\n\nI may be reading way in between the lines, but its possible I think.

Your dad can handle his own business with her.", "What do you mean you \"seasoned\" it? Salt and pepper, or herbs and spices?\n\nThere are some people who taste pepper as \"spicy\", because it contains a chemical that's pretty similar to capsaicin and they have cross sensitivity on their tongues.

You did nothing wrong and keep cooking like you did, it sounds delicious.  The outlier here is the gf.  By her reaction, I don't believe that this is actually about the food/ your cooking.  I believe it is a power play of some sort by the gf and she lost which is why she had her reaction.
