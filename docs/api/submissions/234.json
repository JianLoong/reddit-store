When do you want a call?  What can wait?\n\nIf you say in the comments that she wanted updates or knew she'd want to know, Y W B T A\n\nGenerally, I wanna know hospital stuff as soon as possible if I can get there.  After a trip for something like this would be ok with me.\n\nAnesthesia or surgery, I'm going to try to get back and need to know asap.  Think school nurse rules...what can wait for a note home, what gets a call, and what are you meeting them at the hospital for", "NAH.  You were trying to let your wife enjoy her vacation and your son is okay.  I can understand her wanting to know as well. I don't understand the yta verdicts, he did something extremely nice for his family and he did tell her as soon as he saw her.  Before anyone says that I must not have kids, I have two kids under the age of 10.\n\nEdited to fix a typo.", "NAH. I can understand why she would be upset and the shock is a real part of reacting in the moment but I also firmly believe your intentions were good and no harm was done. She couldn't have changed anything by knowing or being there.\n\n\nYour son is fine. \n\n\nYou're fine. \n\n\nShe was caught by surprise but also didn't miss anything critical. \n\n\nLive and learn. Should it ever happen again, you know she would rather know. Might be worth an apology to keep the peace since it upset her and that wasn't your aim.", "Man, this is a tough call because people feel so differently about these things. You meant well. Maybe YOU wouldn't have wanted to know. I absolutely would have. Are you obligated to know these things about the person you've been with for 16 years? Maybe.\n\nThe reason for me wanting to know is that if I had a great time on the trip I'd feel super guilty afterwards for having a blast while my poor boy had an accident etc etc, and also somehow I as a mother should have felt something happened and I didn't. (Not saying that's reasonable, but true for many moms)\n\nAlso if my husband called I would have offered to come home and then my husband or my son could have told me it's fine. Otherwise I'd always think \"what if he needed me and I wasn't there and now they're playing it down?\" Even if there's nothing I could have done. Being there is what I could have done and often for sick children that does make a difference.\n\nSo enough rambling, NAH if you follow up with your wife and find out why she feels that way and make a deal about what to do if it happens again.", "Had similar experience on a smaller scale. My husband called me before my evening class to say my kid hurt his leg in his rugby game but seemed fine. I said fine and went off to teach. When I got home, it turned out the leg was broken and required surgery (which happened later). Husband knew as soon as it happened that the leg was broken but saw no point in upsetting me or dragging me out of class when there was nothing to be done. I was upset at first, but then realized that not only was he right, it was actually good for both my kid and his father to experience this little crisis together without me, since I usually do crisis management. I suspect this episode will eventually be a good memory for you and your son. NTA. Mom might be upset because she\u2019s not used to not being the crisis handler and feels a bit unneeded.", "INFO\n\nDon\u2019t most cruises have wifi now? You could have at least texted or emailed and she could have seen it when she had service", "INFO: Did your son want his mom or was he okay with her not being called?", "NAH. This was probably a no win situation. I think you made the best decision based on the situation at hand. Especially since son was not asking for mom, was fairly minor and didn\u2019t require surgery. \n\nGlad the kiddo is okay.", "NTA - kids break bones, it happens - you say she would have been difficult to contact and what might have been worse is to tell her and then loose contact and she would be worrying all over the trip while attempting to contact you all the time - what could she have done?\n\nYour son was taken to the hospital, received proper treatment and is healing (I assume?) well?\n\nIt's a sucky situation, but things like these happen. I'm sure she will understand over time that she could not have magically healed his broken arm from the cruise.", "NTA. Your son has two functioning parents, not one. Your son is fine. Your wife could have done nothing about it and/or the trip would have been ruined for what amounts to a rite-of-passage for most kids. Definitely NTA.", "As a mother I would have appreciated a picture of a happy child with his arm in his cast. So you know it happened and that he is okay. But I do get why you didn't tell her.\n\nI am torn between judgements here. Your intentions were good. But in the end, you broke the faith in 'no news is good news' forever. In all trips to follow, your wife will worry that something happened but you just haven't told her yet. YTA.", "NTA, BUT I see your wife\u2019s point. Yes, you were trying to make sure her time wasn\u2019t ruined, I get that.  Can I ask what your wife would have done had she known? I mean I can think she could have gotten a flight back home from a port city? Would she have done that? You know your wife better than anyone, would the broken arm knowledge have ruined her trip? I am seeming to think, you feel this, and that is why I am saying NTA.", "NTA - I think like you and would have done the same thing.", "Nta,  as someone who cruises,  i mean it was not life threatening . She could not get home easy and it would ruin her trip.   I get she is annoyed.  Maybe try to explain if it had been life threatening but, let her know she deserved her vacation without worry", "NTA - I'm a mom and if my husband has it handled and kids are safe then I would prefer not getting a frantic phone call.\n\nEdit:auto correct fix", "NAH. I understand both sides.", "NTA. There would have been nothing she could do except worry. All you did was make sure she had some fun with her mom and sister. Glad your son is ok!", "NTA. He was fine and you were trying to let her enjoy her trip without feeling that she had to come home. Now she can fuss over him!", "I am a mom and I would not be mad at this. So, from my point of view NTA. However, I am not sure that this is going to help you as your son's mom clearly has a different POV...", "This is a no-win scenario.", "NTA. But you wife is with the manipulative silent treatment.", "Coming from your wife's side of an event, I still say you're NTA. My kid and his grandparents went boating on a lake and waves started getting big and capsized (I was away for work at the time). \n\nApparently they were floating in water for 30 plus minutes before thankfully someone noticed them and rescued them (thank god someone was out there somehow).\n\nAnyway my wife didn't tell me until a couple days later when everyone was safe and sound and I almost had a panic attack. I was still going to be gone for months but still, I felt like I should have been there (realistically I never would have been there even if I was home) buty distance made me feel guilty for not being there to help somehow. I was worried what my kid was thinking and if he thought he w as a going to die etc \n\nFor perspective I work for a search and rescue unit and so this hit hard because not long before a family drown when their boat tipped.\n\nAnyway, my point is, you did right because all I did for a week was try not to freak out and feel like a terrible parent because I wasn't there. I wish she HADNT told me unless there was something to tell.", "\"my son, being a boy, broke his arm\" Famously girls' bones don't break", "NAH. I get why you didn\u2019t tell her and get why she\u2019d want to know. I probably would\u2019ve done the same thing you did though.", "NTA, they are armchair quarterbacks.  You have known her for more than 16 years so you made the best decision you could.  When she is ready to talk, find out what she would prefer.", "NTA.  I totally understand why you didn't want to bother your wife.  His broken arm doesn't sound like it was anything serious.  I would have done the same thing.", "NTA. Your intentions were positive and you made a decision after considering the options. I suspect you'd be the bad guy whatever happened and your wife is deflecting her guilt at being away onto you.", "As long as the end result is that my child will heal just fine, there are no complications that i could have helped avoid, and my child wasn't calling out for me, I'd be perfectly happy being allowed to fully enjoy my mom-sister-bonding time.\n\nI consider a broken arm not very serious (unless accompanied by open flesh wounds or internal bleeding). I trust my husband's judgment to make the right medical decisions and make sure my child is comfortable and happy (to the extent an 11yo can be without a switch \ud83d\ude05). \n\nOP, it sounds like you did a fine job tending to son's needs. Son was fine and in good spirits, so I don't quite understand why your wife was mad. Let's say you sent her blow by blow details as events unfolded. Would she have skipped a tour to stay within texting range while you waited for x-rays? Would dinner be getting cold because she was too busy checking her phone waiting to hear the doctor's evaluation?  Would the night's entertainment have mostly been missed as she texted questions and offered opinions on what to do? \n\nWould that consume the topic of discussion for HOURS. ON. END.??? IMO, not only did you do your wife a service, but also her traveling companions.\n\nNTA.", "NTA the reason she might be upset because she wasn't there when her child got hurt and her just relaxing and enjoying. My opinion u did a good job you let your wife relax and the injury wasn't severe", "NTA simply because although I\u2019ve never been on a cruise I know how expensive calling and texting can get and considering cruises AND casts are expensive, it would be one less expense. It was a week long cruise, he didn\u2019t need to be admitted overnight or anything, pretty low stakes. I\u2019m not a minor but when I broke my hand my parents didn\u2019t learn about it until 10 hours later when I realized I still couldn\u2019t move it and it was starting to swell and bruise and needed an appointment lol", "NAH you did good. I think your wife is just feeling horribly that she wasn\u2019t there for her baby boy, and unfairly took it out on you. Not enough for her to be TA, either.", "I think NTA.  Yes, you could have figured out how to reach out since you had 5 days to do so - even something like an email so you need to own that. But overall your intentions were good.  All you can do at this point is apologize, your heart was in the right place and it's something you both have to move on from.  She is probably struggling with her own emotions for 'not having been there'.  You both should talk this out sooner vs. later as you both could end up building resentments (she that you didn't reach her and you could end up insulted feeling her upset comes from she didn't 'trust' you to take care of it all without her).", "You should have told her, but NTA because there really wasn't much she could have done. But still, explain that was your reasoning, apologize and say you realize you should have tried to contact her.", "This is definitely hovering around the line, but NTA. Your reasoning of why you didn\u2019t tell her (excluding technology) is all completely reasonable, but your Wife has every right to be mad at you for it while you\u2019re still NTA.", "NTA \nIf you had told her she would have worried the rest of her trip. While she\u2019s mad about not being told, she more than likely would be mad because her trip was ruined by worrying.", "NTA- nobody would bat an eye if it was the other way round. \nYou took good care of him. He was fine. And like you said: there would have been nothing she could do and she probably would have cut the trip short for nothing.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Kid was fine. Everything was fine.", "NTA.", "NTA. The outcome would not have changed whether she knew about it or not. The only way you'd be wrong is if your son was upset about his mother not knowing.", "NTA\n\nI think I also wouldn't have told my husband. As you said, he could not have done anything and would have spend all trip worrying. I don't understand how your wife says you ruined the trip. But talk it out.", "NTA. You said yourself. She's on a cruise with poor cell service, your son didn't have a life threatening injury, he's doing fine, and there's nothing your wife could've done", "Nta \n\nYou had no way of getting in touch and she would have only worried. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t life threatening. \n\nHowever, what\u2019s she\u2019s feeling now is guilt. Mam guilt for not being there and she\u2019s taking that out on you. Just\u2026 let it pass.", "NTA. I think when your boy gets better it'll just end up being a somewhat humorous story for you two to talk about. It doesn't seem like it now, but you're fine. She's probably just feeling a little guilty of partying while her only son had broken his arm, and that's fine.", "NTA\n\nSomething similar happened to my brother while my mother was on a vacation. My grandmother who was watching us chose not to contact her. There was nothing she could have done and the health issue was not an emergency or overly dangerous, much like OP's son's broken arm.", "NTA - I understand why your wife is upset but your son is fine and there was literally nothing she could do. Apologize and give it time.", "NTA", "I think NAH. What you did was understandable, and her being upset about it is also understandable. You did what you thought was best, but she disagrees, and her feelings were hurt. Now you just need to have a conversation about communication", "YTA", "A message to say \u201cson has broken his arm, not a bad break, is in a cast, no need to return early\u201d May have been in order but it wasn\u2019t life threatening so I\u2019m gonna go with NTA. I wouldn\u2019t have kicked off at my husband for this.", "NTA. You managed the situation.", "You did right. You did them a favor. Your wife, although well-intentioned, is behaving controlling, and should let go.\n\nNTA", "YTA\n\nShe is the mother, even if she can't do anything she has the right to know.", "Soft YTA here. More like butthole territory. Yeah there were ways to contact her or to leave a message and you were coming from a good place by not wanting to worry her. However, that is a big thing to keep from someone. Cruise lines offer WIFI (for an additional cost) but she might have been willing to go for that and just keep her updated through social media DMs. You definitely did not ruin a trip that was already over though.", "I'm going to go with a soft YTA.\n\nYou could have easily texted her and told her about it and said it was totally ok, taken care of, and there was no need for her to worry. But you didn't and now she feels like it was withheld from her. Even if she couldn't have done anything, she still feels like she should have known. What if she wanted to have a quick phone call with your son to make sure he's ok? That's a totally normal thing to want. And I'm not even a parent! \n\nI would acknowledge that you should have told her, while you explain why you didn't. She needs to trust you in the future, so make it clear that in the future you'll let her know when things happen.", "Soft YTA\n\nAn email, text or something in the 24 hours after he's patched up would have made this very different. Maybe she would have got it, maybe not. (The ship might not have free wifi but the ports would) She might not have come home, but would have been able to send her kid a message.", "I\u2019m going with a soft YTA.  She had a right to know about her child being injured, and you could have started any message with, \u201cHe\u2019s doing great, but\u201d", "Slight YTA. Your intentions are good but as a mother I would always be worried when I'm gone now that something may have happened that you're not telling me. It would make leaving again extremely difficult.", "YTA you could have got a message through to say it happened and \"he is fine, he asks you to enjoy your week.\"", "YTA\n\nYou treated your wife like she wasn't an equal parent.  Her child was injured severely enough to warrant a cast, that's important and she should know as soon as possible.   \n\nWere the positions reversed would you really be okay with not being told until you were picked up?", "Obvious YTA. I doubt she was going to try to turn the damn ship around for a broken arm. But by not telling her something clearly very important about your son, you've 100% broken her trust.", "NTA for not wanting to ruin her trip. YTA for the excuses you are trying to make up and for being a sexist (\"my son, a boy, obviously broke his arm\").", "YTA. There's too many children and basement dwellers on Reddit telling you you're not the AH. If my SO had kept this info from me even though I didn't need to be there I would be pissed off.  He wouldn't have because he was an adult.", "Hi OP! \n\nThere is a saying in French that I love, \u00ab\u00a0hell is paved with good intentions\u00a0\u00bb. Just because you meant well doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right. \n\nAs a fellow mother, I really understand her grief; you have denied her the power of comfort at a distance. She wouldn\u2019t have done much, granted, but she would have spoken on the phone to hear his voice telling her not to worry, that she would think of him, all that. If she\u2019s anything like me, she is fuelled by that energy, that comforting aura we like to spread around to our loved ones.", "I mean, minor Y-T-A for the gross misogyny/toxic masculinity of \"being a boy, broke his arm\". Ew. Dude, no.\n\nBut as to the actual issue at hand, **NTA.**\n\nIf it were a head injury, a compound fracture, anything requiring surgery, serious illness, or anything that was going to involve long-term recovery issues like physical therapy, I would have a VERY different answer. But you're right . . . not only was there nothing she could do about this, it was something that would have upset her and it was entirely taken care of without any serious long-term health concerns before she got home. I'm not downplaying the seriousness of a broken bone, but ruining her trip and stressing her out wouldn't have actually made any difference here, and HE WAS GOING TO BE FINE.\n\nIf you had withheld serious news from her, that would be very different. But this was something that was treatable and fixable. You were kind to let her enjoy her trip. NTA.", "I\u2019m not a mother but even I know that not telling her was NOT OK!!\n\nAll theN T A - what the hell is wrong with you?  This is her CHILD. Seriously? Forget about that she can NEVEr trust you to tell her the truth. She had a right to know!!!!!!\n\n\nYTA . WTF", "YTA. I've had something less serious happen before. My son was with my ex husband and his girlfriend, and I was at work. He fell off a slide at a McDonald's and cut through his lower lip, needed to go to the hospital and have stitches. I wasn't told until I got home from work, after midnight. I was furious. \n\nThis is a broken arm. Something that takes significantly more time to recover from. You should have found a way to let her know. Would I have come home right away to go be with my kid? I don't know. It would have depended on how well ex-husband reassured me about my son, and how he was feeling. But I wanted to KNOW. I thought it was a given that you TELL someone when their kids are injured on your watch, regardless of the circumstances. Your wife is probably now feeling like she was right, she can NEVER go on a trip again, because she can't TRUST you to let her know if something is wrong.", "YTA. Your wife will always be wondering when she goes on trips \u201cis everything okay or is he just not telling me something happened\u201d.

Congrats.", "YTA \n\nI absolutely understand your train of thought but you should\u2019ve told her.", "NTA", "NAH I understand the thinking on both sides here. Of course your wife is upset that your son got hurt and she wasn\u2019t there for him. She probably feels a little (undeserved) guilt about that. So she is upset on top of upset. Give her a few days and then talk it through.", "NTA. when i was 14, i got a concussion while my parents were in Italy for their 25th anniversary. the person who was taking care of me (my mothers best friend) decided against telling them as it just would\u2019ve ruined their trip. they got back, she told them, they were a bit worried, but otherwise everything was fine. your wife is just worried, and upset she couldn\u2019t be there for him.", "YTA. As a mom I would be livid if something as major as a broken arm happened to one of my children and I wasn't informed immediately. That's a pretty major life event.

At leas it could be kept abreast of the situation and take comfort in knowing dad has it handled.\n\n I\u2019m sure for her there was a lot of anxiety and classic mom guilt mixed with the excitement of finally getting to do this trip. Coming home to find that your child was injured in your absence probably compounded any guilt or anxiety she probably felt about taking this time away from you guys. She\u2019ll likely hesitate to take another trip like this again for fear of something happening in the future. Mom brains work weird so it\u2019s best to just make sure to keep her in the loop.\n\nA solid apology for not letting her know and assurance that if a similar situation comes up again you will communicate with her will help.

Jack didn't need anything from his mother (like blood or a kidney), so there was no real emergency.  You need to have a real talk with your wife.  You were the parent in charge and you took care of the issue.  Her giving you the silent treatment is unacceptable and insulting, in that she feels you are incapable of handling a medical issue without her being involved.

(Brother was an adult at the time, so not a minor where she would have been able to do something as his parent). Dad didn't tell her right then because there was nothing she could have done that he wasn't already doing, he didn't want her to worry, and he wanted her to be able to have that last bit of time with her sister without feeling guilty or being distracted.\n\nGetting a hold of someone on a cruise is HARD and can be incredibly expensive.

You think girls don't break their arms?", "NTA You did what made the most sense and what you thought was best at the time. Clearly you weren't trying to be malicious or secretive. You took everything into consideration and made a perfectly good decision. If there has been something serious this wouldn't have been an option, but that wasn't the circumstance.", "YTA - \n\nYour wife is silent because it isn't just about your son's arm, she's just processing that you might not be as great as she thought you were, and it hurts. It is a reality check for her. If a process isn't easy and ready (your words)  for you, you might not be dependable. You can't/won't figure things out for yourself if they are too difficult.  You make judgement calls that she doesn't agree with.  If your wife becomes ill in the future, what will happen if she isn't able to make things ready and easy? You withhold information to manipulate her actions (would she come home early was one of the reasons you decided not to tell her).  You removed her ability to choose because you might not have liked her choice.  \n\nFor the record, if you ever need to contact someone on a cruise, call the cruise line.  If you didn't know how to contact her you should have called the cruise line and asked.  It...  I don't want to be really harsh and say you showed a total lack of common sense, but... this seems like a pretty basic move to me.  This whole line of reasoning is so ridiculous that it seems more like a justification for your actions (a flimsy justification) than an actual hurdle that was too difficult for you to overcome.\n\nYour line about not wanting to cut the cruise short and it being crazy expensive.  I can see the good intention there, if I took what you said in good faith, but as flimsy as your other reason/justifications were it is hard to extend good faith.  You made a choice for your wife without her input that she may very well not have agreed with, and you chose to withhold information because you knew she might do something you didn't agree with.  You treated her like a child and manipulated her.  You lied through omission, but blame the omission on contact being too difficult. \n\nYou moved your wife from partner territory, to a place where you withhold information from her and make decisions for her own good, without her knowledge. \n\nThat is a trust breaker. That's going to hurt.\n\nYou can justify each step of your actions for each reason, but the reality is that when you step back, you've really messed up. If your line was that you didn't think it was serious enough to call, and that was your only reason, it wouldn't have been this bad.  The way you reasoned this out though...  reasons one and two - those are what makes this bad.\n\nIt might help your case if instead of asking if you were wrong, you went to her and told her that you understand you really messed up, and that when she wants to talk to you, you are ready to listen and fully accept anything she wants to say to you.\n\nI'm sure your wife will forgive you, and you'll think I'm insanely harsh because the conversation won't be that bad.  The truth is that I don't believe you just are ignorant and made stupid mistakes. I think you made some bad choices, and instead of owning them, you are playing the dumb and didn't know any better card, which is another layer of manipulation that your wife isn't going to be happy about if she comes to the same conclusion.\n\nWeaponized Incompetence is the label that a phone call being to difficult for you to figure out  falls under, and a less trusting person might wonder if you pulled this while she was on vacation to punish her for that, and show her what she can expect if she tries it again.", "NAH", "NTA.

You did your job while your wife was away - well played. \n\nIf you had told her the outcome would have been exactly the same for your son, the only difference would have been that your wife would have had the chance to be anxious, stressed and panicky - maybe she would have enjoyed that? Some people have such straightforward and comfortable lives that they like to create a crisis out of nothing. \n\nOr maybe she is a bit disappointed that you are in fact perfectly capable of looking after your son without her input, perhaps she'd have preferred it if you'd messed up so she had to rush home and save the day. Who knows, but NTA.", "I don\u2019t know your wife or how she would have reacted to the news, but if my husband hadn\u2019t called me straight away I would have been PISSED. \n\nAs long as I knew my kid was okay I would still have been able to enjoy the trip. My flying back wouldn\u2019t have made the arm any less broken. And I\u2019d trust my husband to look after my child while they\u2019re injured.\n\nAgain, don\u2019t know what your dynamics are, but IMO yeah, you\u2019re the AH.\n\nEdit: Also, it sounds like you and your wife need to work on having healthy and open communication. Her stonewalling you isn\u2019t going to help. I don\u2019t mean this in a shitty way, just something to think about moving forward.", "NTA but an email could have been sent. Cruises tend to go to ports for an inland trip and and email isn\u2019t as urgent and can be read whenever. It\u2019s communication.\n\nI\u2019d appreciate not being stressed about it and that you handled it. It\u2019s just communication. I would hope she wouldn\u2019t feel the need to cancel her trip for something you\u2019ve shown yourself to be capable managing aka you took him to the hospital and scheduled the appts. I would like to encourage more men parenting and being capable of these things and not perpetuating women dropping everything because they think their husbands can\u2019t parent.\n\nIf anything out of this you can make a plan on how to communicate issues in the future. Your reasons are logical but communication is still important.", "NTA. Damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t with this one, I think. You had good intentions, and she\u2019s probably just upset about the kid\u2019s arm and projecting the anger at you, maybe even spiraling about \u201cWhat else could have happened that he wouldn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t have told me?\u201d kinda thing. \n\nApologize, tell her now you know, you\u2019ll do better, and give it time. But know you\u2019re NTA. Not much either of you could have done differently. \n\nAnd for the record, I would have done the same thing for my husband if he were mostly unreachable and definitely unable to help, and I can only hope he\u2019d do the same for me.

It's not your place to decide what your wife can and can't know about your son, even if your intentions here were good. It's a matter of trust and you broke it", "NAH.  It was a damned if you do , damned if you don't type of situation. Your wife probably feels mum guilt for not being there for her child. She will get over it", "NTA only because she uses the silent treatment.", "NTA. Why tell her when she's on a cruise, it's not like she can do anything about it from there. All telling her would have accomplished I'd making her worry and possibly ruining her trip. It's understandable that she's upset, because human/parental emotions aren't always logical, but the silent treatment is a bit much. Hopefully she'll get over it soon.", "NTA. I developed kidney stones that required me to be in hospital for about a week and my parents had just left on holiday overseas. My brother and I decided it was best not to worry them and instead tell them when they returned. We figured if it got serious or required surgery we\u2019d loop them in but thankfully we didn\u2019t have to. They were ok with our decision and admitted that it would probably have torpedoed their vacation.", "NTA - wife is shocked / concerned (logical) but a broken bone/arm is not exactly life threatening - and knowing would only have ruined her cruise, so..\n\nWhat I do not get - is why 'everyone' calls you an AH. Does this mean wife went and complained? And sends flying monkeys to 'berate' you?\n\nThat pushes her to the AH category - so it\\`s NTA.", "I would say YTA because this is more complicated than just this isolated incident.\n\nYour wife has gone away for a week with very minimal contact with you and your son. She is inevitably going to worry about you all. Previously she could tell herself that no-news is good-news... that if there was any problem you would have let her know. So she could enjoy her trip with her worries only vaguely at the back of her mind.\n\nNow she can't trust you to tell her when important things happen at home whilst she's not there. Now, if she ever goes away again, she's got to actively check in to make sure everything is OK, and she's going to find it a lot harder to settle and enjoy herself.\n\nIt may have been difficult to get her a message (why on earth don't you have emergancy contact plans sorted in advance)? But you should have let here know that there was an issue, even if it waited until after your son had his cast and was back at home.", "I\u2019m gonna say either NAH or ESH. Cause you thought you were doing a nice thing but to her, she wanted to know if something happened to her kid when she wasn\u2019t there.\n\nLike, imagine if you had both gone away and kid was with someone else. Would you want them keeping that info from you until you got home?\n\nI personally think it\u2019s weird when couples don\u2019t talk about stuff like this in advance. But I am a chronic over thinker so maybe that\u2019s just me. Any time I go away and pay a pet sitter, they ask what they should do in case of an emergency, and I generally tell them unless it\u2019s serious or they aren\u2019t sure what to do, don\u2019t tell me until I get home. But they know the things they should call for. \n\nCommunicate better about how you\u2019ll handle this stuff next time I guess.", "NAH because I genuinely believe you didn\u2019t do this from a place of any selfishness at all. You just wanted your wife to have a great time and it worry. \n\nI can understand her being upset but\u2026 I understand why you did what you did. Just talk it through so you both know in future what the right thing to do is. \n\nYou seem like a good guy and she\u2019d know that.", "You need to talk. If she still doesn't understand, then, it's on her. Besides, what done is done, everyone is safe. She's probably upset she was not able to learn about it sooner but I think she also needs to understand, you did it with good intentions. It's not like it changes anything if she have known about it.", "OP, I get you're getting a lot N T A vibes and I understand their point. But maybe I can help you understand your wife better:\n\n If that was me, I would be hurt to that point where I would've lost trust in my husband and would question our relationship over this event. On top of that, I'd hate thinking back to the trip because the effing trip is the reason I didn't get information about a very important happening with my kids health. So yeah, I get why she's saying it ruined the trip. \n\nIf you two had a trusting relationship, you could've called and reassured her that something happened but that you got it handled. Since you seem to be a capable parent she was fine to leave her kid with (as any good dad should be!), she probably would've been worried but also known that your boy is fine. She could've spoken to your boy on the phone, making sure he was ok and more important: making sure he knew mom cares for him even tho she's far away. This would've done all the difference. Yes, she would've probably felt a bit helpless at first. But she could've agreed with him to call him daily, maybe bring him something special from her trip as a get-well-soon present,... stuff like that. \nThis is not for the kid as much as it would've helped mom to feel like she did everything she could. Making the best out of this situation. \n\nInstead, now she feels like she let her boy down, is scared that her kid learned to \"better not bother mom when she's having fun, even if you got health issues or need help\" (such a bad lesson!) and on top of that lost trust in her husband (which is dramatic since trust is the foundation of every relationship). You basically lied to her, about something important. I know you had the best of intentions, but you still did quite some damage. Help her to solve this and rebuild that lost trust. I'd start with an open heart-to-heart. \n\nSlight YTA.", "NTA. You acted like an adult and took responsibility. Working out what\u2019s best for everyone. I was going to say wife was NTA as she will be shocked, so going silent is a good way to process rather than make a scene. Then she decided to bring her in friends and moan about you ruin the holiday that to be straight, you didn\u2019t. So wife is TA. She\u2019s acting like a high school girl. She should think it through and act responsibility like you did. Probably unpopular but hey.", "NAH cos I can see both sides. Im a worrier when I'm away from my family, even just on a long shift at work. I could see my husband doing exactly what you did so as not to worry me. From my side, if I don't know that he'll be honest and tell me if something is up, then I'm going to worry anyway because I don't know what's truly going on. If I know I can trust him to tell me when something happens, then I know I can genuinely be reassured when he says everything is fine.", "NTA. I have a much younger child and would have been ok not knowing, since the situation was 100% under control. \n\nI think this is just a good opportunity to communicate. You can't change what happened, but you can work to understand future communications. For example, what if she's somewhere handing her own family emergency, where she can't easily come home. What would she like to know about while she's gone?", "NTA. If I was mum, I\u2019d probably be upset momentarily, because mum guilt, but I\u2019d also appreciate that there was absolutely nothing I could have done.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA she's being manipulative because she feels out of control. I don't like the term helicopter mom, but she is really something to want to preside over something she can do nothing about that she wouldn't help. She just wants to be the center of attention. And if she can't be at every single \"big moment\" of her kids life, she's being made out to be a mad mom.(in her head)\nShe's irrational.  You didn't do anything wrong but holy moly behavior like that in a spouse would scare me sitless. Sorry man that sucks. Glad your kiddo is alright", "Nta. He\u2019s fine and how could you have ruined her cruise if she didn\u2019t even know about it until she got back anyway. I\u2019m sorry that you are dealing with this op.

I\u2019m sorry OP.", "NTA - it was the best decision so she could enjoy her trip, and the kiddo is fine.\nWife is also NTA because her reaction would probably have been my exact on if I were in the same position. However you made the RIGHT choice for everyone. She\u2019ll come around and calm down and see that eventually, but she might need a bit of extra TLC to get over the irrational mum guilt.", "Nta. A family friend had his daughter pass away while his wife (the mom) was on vacation. He didn't tell her until she was on her way home. Waiting to tell her changed nothing. It just didn't ruin her trip. This is far less severe than a death. \n\nHe didn't want to ruin something you had wanted for years. He was very considerate. Your kid is going to be fine", "YTA", "nta what was she going to do anyways on a cruise out at sea? Swim back?", "NTA\n\nJust the opposite, you did everything right.  My guess is your wife is just upset with herself that she wasn\u2019t there.  Assure her if it had been anything more serious you would have reached out, but the break was minor and it was easy to handle.", "NTA. you sounds like a standup guy and thats a sweet gift for your inlaws and wife. Telling her would've only soured her trip. Your son is fine, you told her when you saw her, as you said you wouldn't be able to contact her easily when she was gone. \n\n I don't see the point of getting ahold of a ship captain and marching her to the office to tell her her son broke his arm, makes the situation seems much more severe than it is, and that would've given her mucho anxiety,  and definitely ruined the trip.", "Soft YTA.\n\nMy parents would withhold information from me all the time so they wouldn\u2019t \u201cruin my day.\u201d  I would find out relatives died a week ago because my parents wouldn\u2019t tell me if I had stressful things going on at work, or was planning on doing a trip somewhere.  One time my dad lost a lot of blood and fainted and didn\u2019t go to the hospital.  My mom knew this for 3-4 days before telling me because I had a big work event.  She told me in person before I came into the house.  My dad is fine now but it just really gives me lots of anxiety now.  I know my parents feel that they don\u2019t want bad news until after their trip is done, that they don\u2019t mind the wait so they treat me like they want to be treated, hence the soft YTA.  You probably thought you wouldn\u2019t want to know if you were on a trip. \n\nThis is something that deeply bothers me to this day.  I have always told my spouse to let me know any bad news ASAP because of what my parents did.  I get 10 times more upset when I\u2019m the last to find out about things.  Please learn from this and always communicate with your wife on how she wants to be told of situations like these in the future.", "NTA\n\nI would have said nobody is an AH, but I feel like the silent treatment is AH behaviour from your wife.  \n\nShe couldnt have done anything, you made sure he was safe.

There was nothing she could do and he was not injured badly.", "NTA. You had things under control, and she couldn\u2019t have done anything except for worry. It was a relatively minor injury.", "NAH. But I know what it's like to return from a trip and learn of bad news that went down whilst I was away.\n\nI hope it doesn't happen again, but in case it does: you share the news with the timeline of how everything is okay and fully under control as soon as possible.\n\nIn the meantime, apologize for not looping her in. It was misguided of you to do so, but at least your heart was in the right place and you'll know better for next time.", "NTA.  I broke my arm when I was 12, falling off a rearing horse. After the initial pain,  it was no big deal. You acted in good faith.

It would be shocking but hopefully she can see the good intentions and this will be something you laugh about in future.\n\nEdit: I would start with promising that next time you will tell her. That you had good intentions an didn\u2019t think it would upset her", "Nah. You made what you felt was the best choice at the time. There was no really upside to telling her while she was gone. Your wife is probably feeling guilty that she was off enjoying herself while her son was hurt. Neither of you are in the wrong but at the same time emotions are high so give her some time. \nMy husband's grandpa died while he was on a guys trips and his family decided to not tell him until he got back because if Grandpa was still alive he would have gotten so angry if they ruined my husband's trip. You were trying to take the kind approach", "I'm gonna say NAH. It's not wrong for you to just want her to enjoy her long-awaited vacation, and you're right that it wasn't life threatening or anything. It sounds like if it was, you would've called her asap.\n\nBut at the same time, maybe she would've also understood that your son is fine and just relaxed after you told her and let her speak to him too! Now there's probably some part of her that will always be too worried to go on a vacation by herself, because she won't know if something bad happened at home because *you wouldn't tell her*.\n\nI think you should apologize, and be sure to stress that you won't keep things from her anymore if she's gone, even if it's not super dangerous.", "NTA, you did her a complete solid and she came at you for it? women...", "I think she's more upset at herself for something that was beyond her control.  We mom's tend to feel guilty even when we know it wasn't our fault.   Give her time and continue to love her and your son.  You are awesome to give her the time to be with her friends/family and did a great job taking care of the crisis.", "You weren't an asshole per say, but come on!!! Most parents would want that update. I'm sure there was a way to get her a message to call you. NTA, but live and learn", "YTA\n\nYou don't get to decide what your wife needs to know. Nor do you get to censor her information like she's a child.\n\nAfter the entire issue was resolved, you should have sent her a message about what happened, heavily emphasizing that things were handled and the kid was totally fine. Putting the cheerful, chipper kid himself on the phone to brag about getting a cast would have helped immensely.\n\nIf a call wasn't possible, then an email with pictures would have been perfect.\n\nShe wouldn't have worried if you'd given her no reason to worry.\n\nAnd yes, this would ruin her experience for her. Because now she gets to reevaluate your entire relationship and wonder what else you've been lying about or keeping from her \" for her own good.\" You have broken the trust between you in a major, fundamental way.\n\n(And I call bullshit on the \"no way to contact her\" thing. My boss cruises all the time and has always been able to reach work easily.

Thave would have covered you nicely.  Live and learn.", "So completely NTA\n\nAll of your reasons are completely 100 percent valid.  Especially 'what could she do?'  You saved her worrying on the cruise so she could enjoy herself.  There was absolutly NOTHING she could have done while on the cruise.

Then she can stay right where she was at and enjoy herself.  You did right sir, tip my hat to you!\n\nAll the Y T A votes are delusional.  You're wife is the AH in this scenario because she's mad at you AFTER the fact and trying to guilt you by saying you ruined the trip - that is a blatant lie because how could it have been ruined if she didn't even know?  Exactly.  If I were you, I would almost be considering ending the marriage with her over her reaction....\n\nAnd hypothetically, if it was a worse injury or even death, you STILL would not be the AH for letting her enjoy her trip first.

I think it\u2019s a huge leap to call what she\u2019s doing \u201cabusive and manipulative and downright nasty\u201d based solely on this single sentence.", "I highly disagree with this. \n\nWhen my husband and I disagree we \"ignore each other\" or give the silent treatment. We don't out right say it, vut after 9 years it is understood. We fo this because when we don't we snap and snipe at each other. Sometimes it takes the entire day to cool off. We may be sitting on the couch watching TV and ignoring each other, but we wait till both of us cool down before we talk it out. BECAUSE we don't want to say mean, biased, and untrue things. \n\nFoe example, I was pissy getting up one night to take care of our daughter. Usually we got a good method going. That night was a rough night of her waking up a lot amd not wanting to go down easy. Finally got her down and I lay down to sleep. Next turn is supposed to be husband's. It's around 0500-0600. Baby wakes up. I laid down maybe 30 minutes earlier. I roll over to ignore it. Husband says \"baby is awake\". I'm pissed. I throw the blankets off and storm out to go cuddle the baby. \nHe comes in maybe 10 minutes later to see if we are okay. I snipe at him because I wasn't cooled down. He snipes back.  \n\nThere was no \"fault\". He wasn't telling me to go get the baby. I just took it that way. I didn't want to get in a fight so I didn't say anything, it was just \"too soon\" for me to be pleasant and let it go.", "If the takeaway from this AITA post is that the wife is abusive, that just feels too extreme for me.", "He didn't ask for advice, just whether he was an AH or not.", ">Dude if you don\u2019t want advice don\u2019t ask\n\nNoone's asking for advice here.\n\nRule 9.\n\n>9. Do Not Ask For Advice", "9. Do Not Ask For Advice\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.", "Good lord why are you being such an ass about it? OP admits they didn't know things and would have made a different call had they known. You continuing to harp on it makes you a dick. He accepted your advice, he just didn't thank you for it because you deliver it rudely.", "Was I harsh for my last comment?  The down votes seem to see yes.  Advice is fine.  I will take criticism and learn from it.  Your initial comment about texting was valid and I explained why I didn't text.  BELIEVE me, if I knew it was possible I think we'd be having a different conversation. I still have no idea how a text can go through when a phone is in airplane mode and I don't think I ever will.  I will just accept that it happens and wifi is somehow involved.\n\nComing back after I explained with a variation of, when this happened to me I googled it, isn't advice. Just a dig.", "So is OP an asshole for the network not reaching her? Why is everyone trying to find the next type of smoke signal to justify that letting her know something that wouldn\u2019t change anything is so necessary?", "Hence why I said I was exaggerating to illustrate my point.  \n\nIt boils down to should the wife be allowed to emotionally manipulate and guilt the husband because he didn't bend over backwards to inform the wife about something she could not control or intervene in.  And that is the key word - emotion.  In this scenario, the husband was respecting his wife's boundaries of wanting to enjoy this trip.  The husband honored that by not interrupting her cruise for a minor Injury to their son.  It was the logical thing to do.  The husband remained calm during the whole ordeal and handled the problem.  The wife is mad because \"she wasn't told\".  WTF?  How would going through the time, effort, and possibly extra money to contact the wife ON A CRUISE logically assist the situation?  It wouldn't.  It would have just ruined the wife's cruise and trip.  So in summary:\n\nThe wife's good time on a cruise is MORE IMPORTANT then ruining her trip with the news of their child's injury.  Plain and simple.", "That he\u2019s a CHILD and children can be careless and rough", "That boys can be rough and careless when they play? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThough he should know that girls can be just as careless and sometime even rougher than the boys.", "He never at any point lied to his wife, he just didn't call her. But when he picked her up he told her, there is no reason whatsoever the mother needed to know it during the trip as there was no emergency.\nIf you have the need to know instantly when your kid got hurt to be there for them and get this upset about something that's not a major injury, then you sound a lot like an overprotective parent. \nI would agree with you if the kid was with friends or a babysitter, but when the kid is with either your partner or the grandparents for example and they have everything handled, there is no reason to immediately call you. Especially not on cruise where calling is crazy expensive. As long as the mother was told as soon as they talked/texted it is perfectly reasonable.", "That's a fair point. I don't think that single behavior is an absolute indicator of manipulative behavior either. I just think their are more ideal ways to handle things. But humans are not ideal beings so sometimes stuff like the silent treatment does happen, and I do get that.", "So wait, is your point that because we can never truly the the whole story that we can't make a judgement about it? Umm, this the AITH reddit. What I am saying is that from the available information I have, it seems like she's stonewalling him. If you have new information or a different point of view, good on you.", "I respond to the silent treatment with the same treatment. If they ask why I'm ignoring them I just say since they weren't talking to me I was respecting their decision to increase their personal space and comfort. There are plenty of things that I could be doing rather than talk to someone who doesn't want to talk to me", "What is gray rocking?", "Some people just seem to come to Reddit to be smarmy and self-righteous.", "When your phone is in airplane mode you don't get the texts until you turn your phone off from it. So it's basically waiting for you to turn it off for all your texts to come through. So when your wife got back to port she would have turned the phone on and saw that she had a text that your son broke his arm and wouldn't be blindsided.", "I just have to say, seeing your back and forth on here makes me want to buy a beer for both of you. A lovely, civil, back and forth to understand where the other person stands.

The parent comment of the specific comment thread we are currently in countered that the wife is actually the AH because of the sentence about the silent treatment. I would contend that no, a single sentence is not enough information to provide that judgment. If that\u2019s enough for you, well, I guess good on you.", "Okay, I\u2019m not clear on the point you\u2019re making. It\u2019s emotional abuse regardless and if you respond to them when they ask a question then that is not the silent treatment", "Grey rocking is similar to putting someone on an information diet. It's a way to maintain civility while keeping someone at arms length. When that person asks you questions, make yourself as boring as a grey rock. \n\nFor example, as a teenager, I knew if I told my mother something and asked her to keep it to herself, she would promise to do so. Next thing I knew, my dad, grandmother, aunt, & mom's best friend all had an opinion on it. So I learned not to tell my mother anything I wasn't ready for the whole world to know. If she asked me about school or friends or dating... I had no information to share. No one had anything going, I didn't know what all we had planned or who all was going to show up... I gave her nothing of interest to gossip about. \n\nIn fairness to my (now deceased) mother, she did eventually learn to keep things to herself and we were able to grow a lot closer.", "Acting unresponsive.", "You would not believe the anxiety I feel sometimes when commenting an even slight disagreement. People can get real nasty over the smallest things sometimes!", "Okay. That seems fine. Unless you are doing it to control someone then it's not abusive.
