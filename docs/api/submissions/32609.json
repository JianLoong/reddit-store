Asking them to be respected is totally fine in my opinion. You handled it very well. They clearly wanted to do grown up people stuff, thats not for in a public place. If they where offended, thats their emotions they need to deal with.  Good for you, I hope you enjoyed your vacation.", "I am Turkish and I say NTA.\n\nOur culture teaches us to be private in most areas of life and for a foreigner to disrespect my culture would make me pretty mad too.

They were getting off on doing that in front of everyone and you didn\u2019t consent to being part of their fetish. You were nicer to them than I would have been.", "Forget the kids, that's not appropriate behavior in front of anyone. I don't mind PDA, but heavily making out and overly sexual (feeling up and the like) behavior, that's more likely sharing your kink (e.g., exhibitionism) without consent of those around you. If they want that type of vacation, they can go to a hedonism resort. \n\nNTA and good for you.", "NTA. I'd have just reported them and asked that the staff intervene because I don't want to see folks grinding on each other when I'm on vacation either. You were under no obligation to endure their public spectacle. And staff gets paid to manage clientele.", "NTA\n\nHolding hands, arm over shoulders, hugs, and small kisses are all appropriate forms of PDA. With that said if you are sticking your tongue down each others throat then you need to knock that shit off, it\u2019s just weird to be that intimate in public.", "NTA. Some PDA is okay in public (like hugging or holding hands) but making out isn't okay, the vast majority of us don't want to see it.", "NTA, if it makes you uncomfortable and it's a public area then you're allowed to say something. Whether they stop or not it how they respond is up to them.", "NTA - it\u2019s disrespectful towards everyone around them", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
