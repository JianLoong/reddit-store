I wasn't totally on board at first seeing as my house isn't very big and there's a ton of people on my husbands side. Enough that having my family over would be way too many people in the house. I'm excited about it now and we're going to make it work with the space we have. Now my nephews birthday was a couple days ago and they celebrated at home on the day and he's asked for a friends from school party instead of a family party. So my sister in law has now asked if she could bring a cake and celebrate his birthday on Christmas at my house. I want to tell her no. It's  more then 2 weeks after his birthday and it's Christmas. He's already had 2 celebrations does he really need a 3rd? So am I the asshole if I say no?", "created_utc": 1670661052, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhn2sa/wibta_saying_no_to_hosting_a_3rd_bday_party_on/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is a family event and he's having friends instead of family for a party. But after she told me I have to do Christmas, I don't think she's in the right to ask me to host a birthday party on top of it.

Your sister in law just wants the entire world to revolve around her precious little sunshine. You would be well within your rights to refuse even if the birthday was on Xmas.", "NTA, it\u2019s your house. You have the right to not host a birthday party in your own home. It seems although SIL is just trying to get all the attention at a family function and using you for your kindness. She already came up with a bogus excuse to not host Christmas and wants you to accommodate her child even more than any other guest. Do whatever you feel comfortable doing, don\u2019t let people abuse your kindness or guilt you into doing something only because they\u2019re too lazy to host their own parties and spend their own money on decorations, festivities, and getting their family to come over.", "NTA. He already got two celebrations, he doesn't need to turn Christmas into a third birthday party, too. If his birthday was more than two weeks ago it makes no sense to celebrate his birthday again.", "YWNBTA - Not every day has to be about her son's birthday. I assume there are other kids for Christmas coming over and a family is coming over. The holidays are about everyone.", "Definitely NTA. Your house, your comfort level, and you're already the one doing all the work!", "NTA. It's Christmas. As you point out, his birthday was two weeks ago.  Unless his name is Jesus it's a big fat no no.", "NTA and it's a very strange request. Most parents with kids born in December work at keeping Christmas and birthdays seperate for good reason. It's really easy for small children to get overwhelmed by both Christmas and birthday parties. There's  lots of people, presents, sugar, hype, lack of routine etc. Its all high jinks, giddiness and excitement until everything implodes and its tears, wailing and meltdowns. \n\nBy declining to host birthday party number 3 on Christmas day you are not just saving yourself a headache and extra work you're also doing good for the kid and the rest of your guests.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t do it. On Christmas Day? What school friends would even be allowed to go on Christmas Day, I wouldn\u2019t want a bunch of kids you don\u2019t even know in your house. There is way more points to make like already having 2 celebrations but I\u2019m calling it your not the the asshole, but your sister in law seems to be.", "NTA- my birthday is a week after Xmas (\\NyD) and I\u2019ve always been taught that Xmas is family time and isn\u2019t about me. This kids birthday was 2 weeks before so hell no. And if she disrespects you by bringing cake, I\u2019d either bin it or ask her to leave", "NTA\n\nUnless his birthday is the 25th I see no reason to indulge this.", "NTA, she\u2019s hijacking your party.", "NTA. Why would he need a 3rd birthday party\u2026 a bit over the top if you ask me", "NTA \n\nHe already has had a party and it was 2 weeks ago. Every other child would need their own cake too, detracting from Christmas. \n\nOr allow her a cake as long as it says Happy Birthday Jesus and everyone sings Happy Birthday to Jesus.", "Nta, and I'll give you one better - if you're celebrating his birthday, obviously that means she's hosting since she wants to direct the party.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you was gonna do that you might as well throw in  valentine's easter n Halloween while your at it maybe President's day idk", "NTA.

Has she never learned to tell her son \"no\"?", "NTA", "I think that would be a bit harsh if his birthday was actually on Christmas. Us Christmastime birthdays already miss out on a lot!

If she tries to bring a birthday cake, you will not allow it in your house. If she starts singing happy birthday, you will kick her out of your house and she will be banned.
