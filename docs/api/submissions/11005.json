I don't want to waste it at a job where I've already put in 20 years. \n\nI had a new boss (45M) start about a year ago, and he was a jerk. There aren't many women in my field, and the couple who used to work with me left because of the sexism and harassment. When I told him I wanted to quit my job, he said, \"You can't quit, you can only leave when I fire you!\" I then asked him to fire me, to which he replied, \"Now why would I fire you?\" After arguing back and forth about how it was personal matter and shouldn't have to explain, I broke down in tears and told him it was because I had cancer and wanted to spend it with my family. \n\nHe laughed and said \"My father had cancer, he did not die and he worked. Cancer isn't that bad. Its like covid and will go away. You woman just will use anything as an excuse.\" I was so exhausted that I blurted it out right then and there \"I don't care if your father had cancer and worked. My doctors even advised me not to do anything stressful. This job is stressful, and I can't take it anymore. Both cancer and Covid is serious especially to those who are older.\" \n\nI quit my job and never returned. I contacted the owner of the company and got him fired. When my coworkers found out, they called me an asshole because \"boss is young he probably doesn't understand cancer, you ruined his life\" and the younger coworkers called me a bitter old bitch. I told all of them boss is a grown 45 year old man and knows right from wrong. I went no connect with all of the coworkers that defended him. \n\nI don't think of myself as an asshole, but I won't ever apologize to that man. I just wanted to quit my job so I could spend more time with my grandchildren and play video games. I started playing video games with my granddaughters, which is a lot of fun. I'm very privileged that I can quit my job during this.

First of all, let me offer you my best wished for you and your family for your diagnosis.\n\nSecond - you did nothing wrong. You were right - a 45 year old man should know better than your old boss did and, in the long run, you did your old co-workers (and your old company) a bigger favor by getting him fired than if you had let things drop.

Clearly you probably care if someone had/has cancer, but you\u2019re basically letting the boss know you don\u2019t want to be compared to anyone else who had/has Cancer. No one wants to hear what someone else was doing while they were dealing with something. Everyone deals with shit differently. Your boss was an insensitive AH. You have every right to quit your job. To not only act like you had no choice but to stay working, but then throw Cancer in your face when his own father had it? Ignorant and insensitive. The fact that he compared it to Covid and then was misogynistic about how women just make excuses?

His age, lack of knowledge, etc does not erase how he conducted himself.  He's bears the weight of being fired; not you. \n\nConscious living; that is what you are doing! Soak it in while caring for yourself & those you love.", "NTA.", "NTA. You're better than me, I would have said something similar to \"puck you\" and would have flipped birds my whole way out of the building. To give 20 years of your life to something, only to be disrespected and degraded when you can no longer do so is unacceptable. Absolutely not.You did right, do not ever apologize for it.

This person is on the back half of their career (start around 25 or earlier, 20+ years in with 20 to go), not the beginning and they definitely know better.  In fact his carelessness in how he talks to people would likely have led to a company lawsuit before too long as that person had what I believe medically is called a rectal cranial inversion or in more common terms their head up their A.  They took zero account of your wishes or condition and just compared you to someone else with (some unknown form of) cancer and how they handled it.  There are literally dozens of forms of cancer and each impact the body differently.  Even two people with the same form of cancer can be at different stages and health and each person is free to choose their own path based on their family situation and doctors recommendations.  What you said was unkind, but you were pushed to it by their refusal to listen to you and frankly they deserved that and to lose their job.  My only question is how it got so far with them.  You said you quit and he said he would not let you, but then your response should have been IDGAF that you do not want me to I still quit.  Even if there is some sort of contract where you are, your Doctors have advised you to stop working in a stressful job so you would have had an out there anyway.", "How can kids grasp the gravity of cancer but this grown ass man is too young to understand? The problem isn\u2019t that he doesn\u2019t understand how bad cancer can be cause everyone over the age of 10 understands that it can kill a person and if it doesn\u2019t then it can make a person really sick depending on the type of treatment needed. Most people with cancer get really sick unless they catch it extremely early and can be surgically removed without further treatment. Which I bet was the case with his dad. He deserved to be fired. NTA. I do pray (I hope that ok with you) that you get to spend a lot of time with your family before the cancer makes it impossible to do so. These memories with your grandchildren are so much more important than some job working for a weasel.", "NTA you have got bigger fish to fry than worrying what you said to your former boss.
