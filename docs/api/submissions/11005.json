When I told him I wanted to quit my job, he said, \"You can't quit, you can only leave when I fire you!\" I then asked him to fire me, to which he replied, \"Now why would I fire you?\" After arguing back and forth about how it was personal matter and shouldn't have to explain, I broke down in tears and told him it was because I had cancer and wanted to spend it with my family. \n\nHe laughed and said \"My father had cancer, he did not die and he worked.

I went no contact with all of the coworkers that defended him. \n\nI don't think of myself as an asshole, but I won't ever apologize to that man. I just wanted to quit my job so I could spend more time with my grandchildren and play video games. I started playing video games with my granddaughters, which is a lot of fun.

They took zero account of your wishes or condition and just compared you to someone else with (some unknown form of) cancer and how they handled it.  There are literally dozens of forms of cancer and each impact the body differently.  Even two people with the same form of cancer can be at different stages and health and each person is free to choose their own path based on their family situation and doctors recommendations.  What you said was unkind, but you were pushed to it by their refusal to listen to you and frankly they deserved that and to lose their job.  My only question is how it got so far with them.  You said you quit and he said he would not let you, but then your response should have been IDGAF that you do not want me to I still quit.

The problem isn\u2019t that he doesn\u2019t understand how bad cancer can be cause everyone over the age of 10 understands that it can kill a person and if it doesn\u2019t then it can make a person really sick depending on the type of treatment needed. Most people with cancer get really sick unless they catch it extremely early and can be surgically removed without further treatment. Which I bet was the case with his dad. He deserved to be fired.
