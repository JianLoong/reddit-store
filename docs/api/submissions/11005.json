They took zero account of your wishes or condition and just compared you to someone else with (some unknown form of) cancer and how they handled it.  There are literally dozens of forms of cancer and each impact the body differently.  Even two people with the same form of cancer can be at different stages and health and each person is free to choose their own path based on their family situation and doctors recommendations.  What you said was unkind, but you were pushed to it by their refusal to listen to you and frankly they deserved that and to lose their job.  My only question is how it got so far with them.  You said you quit and he said he would not let you, but then your response should have been IDGAF that you do not want me to I still quit.

The problem isn\u2019t that he doesn\u2019t understand how bad cancer can be cause everyone over the age of 10 understands that it can kill a person and if it doesn\u2019t then it can make a person really sick depending on the type of treatment needed. Most people with cancer get really sick unless they catch it extremely early and can be surgically removed without further treatment. Which I bet was the case with his dad. He deserved to be fired.

I am so GLAD you got him fired for the sake of other women out there.", "NTA. You spend your life how you want to. He deserved to be fired. He treated you terribly. It was unprofessional of him. I hope everything goes well for you.", "NTA, he was incredibly rude towards you, and if he wasn't smart enough to understand how severe cancer can get, he wasn't smart enough to be in a leadership position. \n\n I hope you are able to spend as much time as you want with your grandkids and make lots of happy memories with them.", "NTA.  Hugs of love and peace to you.", "NTA. Fuck em all. And fuck cancer. Enjoy your time with your grandkids and I hope you make memories with them they will cherish forever.", "NTA I am so sorry for your diagnosis,  I'm younger then this guy and i know cancer is  a big deal.  I was also diagnosed at 38 with breast cancer so i've been there.  Complete with a boss who didn't seem to understand. (it was very inconvenient to her). This guy could have caused a wrongful termination lawsuit, created a toxic work environment and was a jerk to a sick woman.  His termination was his own fault.  Take some time, but i hope there is a better prognosis than what you are saying here.", "NTA\n\nMy mom was diagnosed with cancer when she was 45. She died when she was 51 and I was 23. He\u2019s not young and inexperienced with cancer he\u2019s just lucky and completely devoid of empathy. You have absolutely made the right choice here and your granddaughters will remember playing games with you and loving you. I hope for as a gentle a journey as you can get in this chapter of your life and if you ever think about that man again, may it be only with laughter when you imagine him getting fired by his daddy in front of his coworkers.", "NTA. You did the right things across the board. Soak up all the joy you can, and God bless.", "NTA the only response when someone quits is to say good luck in the future. Instead this jerk was sexist and a full horrible excuse of a human. I for one, only wish him the worst.", "NTA, the boss clearly is lacking in humanity and shouldn't be in charge of anyone.", "Nta what the actual f?", "NTA. \"Boss is young and doesn't understand cancer\"?! They made a Peanuts special about a kid getting cancer! If children can understand cancer, so can he", "NTA. Your former boss was a 45 yr old man. That is old enough to know better.  He was a liability for the company due to the egregious way he treated you. I bet he had made other people miserable too who just left quietly.  I hope you find peace and happiness during this time.", "Hey dude, hope you get to chill with your grandkids for a while. Remember your grandkids love you to death! \n\nI'm sorry that happened to you I would've fought all of them in your honor. Wether or not you are/were a \"bitter old bitch\"(which I kinda doubt), what was said to you is wrong. You're right, he's 45 he should be less arrogant than that.", "Maybe, but you didn't use your dad's cancer to try to get employees to work. So that's a plus.", "NTA - your \"boss\" and your co-workers however are assholes.\n\nHowever I am curious what hell were you working at? \n\nF59, manager and have to lift extremely heavy things. Unless you are working in some fitness industry that does not compute. Manager position normally means you have underlings doing the lifting.", "NTA.  I just lost a friend to cancer today.  You deserve to make the most of every moment you have OP.  Best of luck to you", "Live your best life. Wish you all the best.\n\nAnd that person is 45 years old. Hardly a young boy. He totally deserves to get fired.", "I cannot believe anyone is dumb enough to think 45 is too young to understand the severity of cancer. I\u2019m 42. I\u2019m not \u201cyoung\u201d. I\u2019m also not stupid.\n\nGood for you for focusing on what is best for you. That company owes you a retirement package, but even if they don\u2019t offer that, at least you have the satisfaction that the sexist AH got fired.\n\nSending you thoughts of peace and comfort.", "NTA NTA NTA. I hope his life is ruined, fuck that guy, and fuck everyone who defended him. I hope that whatever time you have left you spend enjoying your life and grandkids.", "NTA in any way shape or form. Your ex boss can go straight to hell. What a cruel person he is.", "NTA\n\nYour ex coworkers and boss are.", "Young?! 45 is old enough to have kids in college, married or even be a grandparent himself. It also means he grew up with all the modern tools computers, smartphones and Google to easily find out how serious cancer and covid can be. So NTA \u00d7 1000. Sorry for your diagnosis but you deserve to enjoy whatever time you have left with family and friends. He got himself fired from that job.", "First of all, sending you a lot of love and hugs, you did the right thing, life is to spend it with the people we love, work is an awful necessity but if you didn't need it anymore that's awesome!Second, NTA at all. It what universe is 45 years old \"too young to understand cancer\"? I'm 47 years old but I understand cancer since I was about 15 or 16 when they taught us about it in biology class in high school. By the time you're 45, you already lost some people, some to cancer, or know a friend or relative that did. Your former boss is just an AH and no, you don't need to apologize to anyone. Also, what's wrong with your former coworkers to side with this man over this? Keep them blocked.", "NTA. Sounds like your boss hired a bunch of toxic sycophants. It kind of makes me wonder Der if your in  the same line of work I was in which if thats the case that \"profession\" attracts some of the shittiest , aggressively lazy, self defeating malignant narcicists I have ever had the displeasure of working with.", "NTA, I was **9** when I lost one of my grandfather's to cancer (lost the other to it at 11). If I was capable of understanding cancer at a single digit age, a fully grown man can understand it. Those former co-workers of yours that defended his appealing (and sexist) behaviour can choke, along with that jerk boss, he ruined his own damn life.\n\nI genuinely wish you all the best and when the time for your passing comes, it is peaceful.", "NTA, but kinda a hero.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwalk away and feel a sense od job well done!", "NTA - What kind of slave ship did he think he was captaining?", "YTA for writing the fakest post I've seen on here.\n\nYou think 59 is a long life? You're a manager but have to lift things? You argued about getting him to fire you instead of just not showing up? You called and got him fired for refusing to fire you after he wasn't fired for sexual harassment? The other coworkers had a way to contact you after you left? The other coworkers argued he was young and \"didn't understand cancer\" even though he was 45???? \n\nCome on friend. This reads like bad fanfic.", "Like, seriously.  I learned at about 10 when we started doing st. Jude fundraisers in school that cancer is serious.  And as a 40 year old, have known 2 people die of pancreatic cancer.  Sorry, OP, that you have one of the worst forms of cancer.  You did absolutely right, and I wish you a happy and much longer life than you expect!", "That's late middle age. It's only early if he lives to be over 90.", "Yes the whole thing could have been avoided if you just didn\u2019t argue with them.\n\nAn employer/employee relationship, like a romantic relationship, requires the consent of both parties. You don\u2019t have to convince him to let you quit or fire you or agree that you have a good enough reason. You just tell him you quit, you inform HR if he\u2019s being weird and not doing the formalities, and that\u2019s it", "I had a boss tell me that once. He was a narcissistic asshole who required me to go to the company Christmas party three weeks after my mom suddenly died. \n\nWhen he finally fired me a few weeks later I was humiliated but also relieved. That place was terrible.", "Yeah that\u2019s surely illegal..? You can\u2019t hold an employee against their will", "Nah, this is absolutely plausible. People can be absolutely terrible humans beings. \n\nMy grandmother did a similar thing to me. I had surgery and was unable to move for weeks bc it was so painful. Her neighbor had surgery for the same condition, however the surgeries were very different due to the severity of the problem. The neighbor\u2019s was a non invasive surgery where as mine was very invasive.  Well, I couldn\u2019t go to the family gathering for Good Friday bc I had this surgery the prior Wednesday.  My grandmother called a bitched at me for not planning on going when \u201cmy neighbor so and so had that surgery and she was fine the next day\u201d.  Was that supposed to magically make it not hurt anymore?  Or was she trying to call me on some bull shit?  I still don\u2019t know what the point of it was because I was unable to move or I\u2019d bust my stitches. Good for her neighbor for her surgery being a breeze and all, but that wasn\u2019t how my experience played out.", "I said harassed, not sexuallt harrassed. 59 going on 60 is a long life when your grandkids are getting ready to have their own babies. I've been there for 20 years, i thought i had a great relationship with everyone else there. people will make excuses for anyone no matter how dumb or in the wrong they person they are defending is.", "Never too early or too late for a mid life crisis. Hell, have two if you find one doesn't go the direction you want it to.", "People age really differently. I know 60 year olds in wheelchairs and 96 year olds who are up walking around, living very full lives. It's crazy. I'd count middle age as 35-45, depending on the person.", "At 38 my doctor told me I was middle aged. I guess if you go by statistics I was bit i sure didn\u2019t feel it", "If his own father thinks he was out of line, I think you're fine.", "It seems like firing your son over one thing would be pretty extreme. There must of been more.   And the idea that you can\u2019t quit, ok I\u2019ll just sit here and collect a pay check.", "Im sorry about what is happening to you. You mad the right decision. His own father fired him for what he did which should tell you something.", "Sounds like you've saved others from going through the same thing!  Nothing wrong with a bit of schadenfreude for a good cause like that", "The father who is a cancer survivor. \n\nI think that may have been the deciding factor, hearing that your own son is minimising and disregarding the terminal cancer diagnosis of a long-term, trusted employee.", "Oh I know it doesnt matter. I was just adding it because that was why my coworkers called me an asshole", "This is all made up.", "Same.", "Why did the conversation continue beyond that point. Why ask him to fire you. Why not just say something to the effect of, \"I'm not asking permission. Bye.\""]}
