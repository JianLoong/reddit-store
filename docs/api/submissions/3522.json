Getting into what if's with a teenager is often a losing game, especially when some of yours don't make sense (if there is a fire drill, he goes out wearing whatever he has on. They're not going to let him stop for his pants)\n\n2. He's 14. There has to be space for ill fated teenage decisions so he can experience natural consequences (plus the number of teenage/college age boys I have seen running around in shorts in a Canadian winter really makes me wonder how bothered he would have been).", "NTA. But.... when my son was 14, it was shorts all the time, with a hoodie. Now it's joggers and a long sleeve shirt. They go through moods. Really is a pick your battles thing....", "NAH. He\u2019s old enough to make his own choice on whether he\u2019s cold or not. A solution to all those reasonable concerns you have is to have him pack a pair of trousers in his backpack in case\n\nETA spelling", "NTA. You were trying, but at this age\u2026pick your battles, my friend. And maybe put some emergency gear in your car: blanket, snacks, water to plan around those edge cases. It\u2019s just not worth the fight. My son didn\u2019t wear a coat to school from about 7th grade on. We just bought him his first parka for his freshman year in college.", "Info: OP the 18 degree weather, thats Fahrenheit yes?", "Canadian weighing in.... You are not ridiculous. I've been in situations where a fire alarm went off unplanned in the middle of winter. I've slid off the road because of black ice. I've also just been fucking cold.\n\nYou weren't saying no to the shorts, you just wanted him to find a weather appropriate compromise.\n\nNTA... You're a good parent (step or otherwise)", "NTA. Kid is out in near frostbite weather, shorts are definitely not appropriate for that condition", "Your definitely NTA. Anxiety and preparation are 2 different things. What if you get stranded on the way to school? You'd have a teenage stepson in the middle of 18 degree weather with no pants on. You've assumed a father figure role for this entire family, and with that comes the responsibility of keeping your family protected and safe. Same thing goes for the mother. I'd explain that to her. The fact that she wanted you to let her son wear shorts in 18 degree weather is absurd. You prepared for the worst case scenario in order to keep him safe, u ain't the asshole man.", "NTA\n\nBut not for most reasons being mentioned here. The kids mom left you in charge of parental duties that morning. If she trusts you enough to give you this responsibility then she should back up your parenting. Instead she undermined you. The right way to have handled this would have been for her to tell you in private that it\u2019s ok if you let a 14YO be a little bit of an idiot and wear the shorts but she should have told the 14 YO that when you are on parenting duty then you have to listen without being argumentative. Wearing pants in freezing weather is a reasonable request and you were trying to handle the situation to the best of your ability.", "NAH.  Of course \u201cput some pants on\u201d is the common sense suggestion in 18 degree weather, but there\u2019s only so much you can do to talk common sense into someone who insists on wearing shorts in 18 degree weather in the first place, especially when you add a dose of teenage stubbornness on top of that.", "NAH.\n\nBut clothes are not worth your battle. So long as they're in dress code, I don't worry. I have a 12 year old... she'll wear hoodies when it's 85 and short sleeves when it's 40. Teenagers are weird.

I live where it can go into the negatives with the wind and always make sure I have an extra jacket or something\n\n\nMaybe an alternative is he just packs the pants with him?

They walked to school, since I was at work by the time they would go. I got a couple calls from the school, and said \"i get you want to wear shorts. That's fine.

There have been some very constructive comments on here and I am taking them in stride. I feel like I might a little bit be TA but only because of his age. He is 14 and although I think it\u2019s very stupid to wear shorts in the weather we have here, this is not a situation where I should put my foot down and fight this fight. I do have emergency supplies in my car, including a blanket, so I will just rely on that if something does arise. He\u2019s old enough to make his own decisions. Thank you all for the input.", "NTA for asking him, but at 14 he needs to learn about consequences. Google why does my son wear shorts in winter....interesting article. What is is doing is not unusual.", "NTA you're teaching him. Winter is all about the layers. It's 10 degrees outside right now and I dropped my daughter off at school. She's wearing leggings under her jeans with the understanding that she can take the jeans off when she wants to and change into her regular shoes that are packed in her bag. \n\nI tried for mittens buuutt she refused and as we walked up to the building was mentioning how cold her fingers were. \n\nGranted my daughter is 6, not 14.

Let him chose what clothes he wears. If you're worried about the car breaking down, take a blanket in the car.\n\nYou mean well, and we all agree that your suggestion to wear pants is sensible, but the kid is 14. This is one of those times when he can learn things for himself. If his legs get a bit chapped from the cold, that will be a useful lesson. There isn't really a realistic scenario where he'll end up with frostbite so bad that his legs have to be amputated.\n\nNAH", "YTA, he\u2019s 14 not 4.

Save your interference for things that actually matter.", "Very mild YTA. \n\nThe kid's 14, old enough to suffer the consequences of his actions as a learning tool.\n\nFWIW my youngest is on the spectrum and will not wear anything but basketball shorts, even when it's cold and raining. I figure it's his knees and if he can't handle his choice he'll ask me for long pants. He hasn't so I let his knees and shins suffer the weather.\n\nAlso you're not the kid's parent.

We had many student workers. One student worker in particular was KNOWN for wearing shorts when it snows. It was his thing. He was killed in an automobile accident in spring 2020 weeks before he graduated with his bachelor's in Architecture and was set to travel to Europe to kick off his internship before returning to obtain his masters in Architecture. I'll always think about him when I see someone wearing shorts in the snow. \n\nYour reasons aren't unjust - a compromise would have been to carry a pair of pants in the car. Let your kid dress himself. He's old enough. \n\nNTA - but you will be if you keep fighting with your teen over silly things. Fight about not doing drugs or sneaking out to go drink alcohol in a farm field somewhere. Shorts are silly. Let him be silly.", "YTA, but also new to parenting. It would be different if he was 4, but this is just a teenager thing. I also refused to wear a winter coat until my mid-20s, but have no real idea why. Every teen boy in my neighborhood goes out shoveling snow in shorts, and now I just laugh at them as I drive by in my many layers. Very low chance of frost bite/hypothermia or getting sick unless you live miles from civilization. They'll figure it out eventually.", "Wearing shorts with a collared shirt, tie and jacket looks ridiculous", "He may be 14 but he's still your responsibility, especially if he gets sick while on your \"watch\", and you offered a reasonable compromise (shorts indoors, pants outside). **NTA**", "slightly YTA, I think u should have just let him wear the shorts and the worst case scenario is he gets sick and will hopefully learn from the experience next time he wants to dress inappropriately for the weather", "YTA. And I bet he acted that way because you're not his parent. What else does mom's live in boyfriend put his foot down for? Do you always discipline her children or do you just feel like it's your manly duty to teach?  And maybe I'm saying this because I have personal feelings about the matter since I myself was subjected to my mother's boyfriend thinking he could come in and boss me around. It ended up to the point where I got really mouthy and he threw me in the shower. It was horrifying and my relationship with him (and mom) never improved because of it. If only he had tried to be my friend instead of my superior...", "YTA. Not because of the merit of your arguments, but because it isn\u2019t your place to father her kids.

Pants are TA. You're NTA.", "Softly YTA but with good intentions. This is not a fight worth having. This same kid may try to wear a hoodie when it's 100 degrees outside.

I grew up in winters in the Midwest, by the way. \n\nLet it go. If he ever has an emergency, he'll learn firsthand himself. If it makes you feel better, keep an extra pair of sweatpants in the trunk for him as a just in case. Hopefully you'll never experience a situation where it's needed. But in the event that you ever do, I imagine that moment will be a teaching lesson for him. lol", "This is not the hill you want to die on.   He's old enough to learn of he gets cold....and you being a nervous nelly about things that 'might' happen in theory is going to color the rest of your relationship with your soon to be step son.   Is that what you want?  It's shorts....not a damn moral or legal issue.", "NAH BUT he\u2019s a teen and he can make his own decisions on what to wear, if he want to wear shorts in the winter let him, tell him to at least pack pants just in case but don\u2019t push him on it, he will learn quick himself if he gets cold and will wear appropriate clothing from now on, if you push the issue on something so insignificant then as a teen he will just push back and cause unnecessary fights", "You're not an asshole for it, but tbh natural consequences are probably the best way for a teenager to learn shorts in the snow is a bad idea. He's not going to be outside long enough to risk hypothermia in them, and tbh the number of girls in that sort of climate who continue to wear skirts in the winter is high, this isn't unusual. I've definetly worn a skirt in that weather in December to school and got caught outside due to a false fire alarm for an hour, I didn't die.", "Yta look, there are just some kids, mostly boys, who wear shorts year round. I do not understand it. \n\nBut this is part of his bodily autonomy.  It's not harmful, just kind dumb.", "YTA because this is not your kid and he is 14 and old enough to make his own decision about this issue. If he got cold then he would learn to wear pants next time. But the bigger issue is that you are not his parent. You are not even his stepparent. Stop parenting him.", "YTA. He\u2019s fourteen. Let him dress however he chooses. If he is cold, he\u2019ll learn to dress more appropriately for the weather in the future.", "YTA for overstepping with your girlfriend's son. In all seriousness, what's the worst that happens? He gets chilly for a little while. Unless you live in the wilderness where there is a real possibility of sliding into a ditch and having to hike to find a cell signal, bare shins in cold weather is mildly inconvenient. Did you grow up in a cold area? I used to wear shorts to the bus stop when it was colder than that. I think you're right, it would have been objectively less risky overall to have him wear pants, but... not your kid, man, and there wasn't any real risk of bodily harm here.\n\nNext time, just quietly take a pair of sweats in your cold weather kit in your car, so you can be the 'hero' if an emergency does come to pass.\n\nAlso, if you were scared for this child's long term health in this scenario, then yeah - you might be projecting some anxiety onto the situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'll change my mind if he lives in the middle of nowhere and the kid actually had some possible danger in this situation, but bare shins are not going to be an emergency in any suburban scenario.", "my daughter still wears t-shirts in the middle of winter. She's never really cold. In the summer she regularly lies on the couch with a blanket. Adolescents and temperature is a special combination.\n\nShe has a winter coat on, so I'm not too worried about it, if she gets cold at school, she'll put on her coat. Does she wear a skirt while it's snowing and get cold? Own fault. I'm not going to fight that fight anymore.", "He may be 14 but he's still a minor in your care, i.e. your responsibility. Your compromise was perfectly reasonable and appropriate for the situation - shorts indoors, pants outside. I live in a Nordic country, and you simply do not mess with winter weather. Had a high school mate who kept wearing shorts, even when it snowed - once while in class, all traffic was stopped due to sudden snowstorm, and he had no option but to walk home in said shorts. He ended up in hospital for a short while with pneumonia. Save to say, he learned his lesson from that.", "Alligators.", "Based on the fact that he said it's snowing, I'm assuming the 18 degrees is fahrenheit. If you're from the rest of the world that uses Celsius, that's about -7 degrees. So frostbite and hypothermia is the worst that could happen if he wore shorts. Letting him change after he got to school or wearing the shorts under parents seems like a good compromise to me.", "Nothing like frostbite for a learning experience.", "Yeah, my sister was a teen standing in like six inches of snow wearing short shorts, spaghetti strap shirt, and flip flops (our high school had no dress code whatsoever). I am 5 years younger than her and boy did I know she was a fool, lol. She did have a winter coat over that, lol, but it was still short shorts and flip flops literally in the snow", "I remember a few classrooms that were saunas.", "Yeah you have fashion victims (they usually aren't outside for real harm to happen) and then you have people who just run hot.\n\nA friend of mine wears light, flowy skirts all year round. In winter all she adds are one pair of leggings and a sweatshirt. In Canada. And no, she's genuinely not cold.", "I mean, you could get hypothermia in 18 degree weather (really anything colder than 50), but the risk of that happening on the way to school is obviously incredibly low lol. Especially if he's taking the school bus or is within a short walk of school \n\nI think my compromise would be that he has to take some pants in his backpack, so it's there if/when he either realizes that he's miserable, or if there actually was an emergency", "And if he's going to be inside all day, the building might be heated very well, even too well. I remember a few classrooms that were saunas.", "Yeah, the number of teachers against the coat pile is so funny-- once the kids get running, they shed their coats because theyre too warm. If they get cold, they'll putthe coat back on. Nobody is going to die.", "Yes thanks I concur, I was just confused as to how anyone would suggest that a 14 year old be allowed to mosey out of the house in shorts when its -7\n\nNTA OP frostbite is not a learning device!", "Oh I've definitely forced her to bring a jacket before so I didn't look like the neglectful parent. \n\nThe most effective thing in elementary was when the teacher refused to let them go outside for recess without a jacket. She wore it then! \n\nWe fortunately live in an area where snow is uncommon so it's not usually an issue. I DO ask her if she has a tank top or other shirt on under her sweatshirt when it's hot and she's wearing it though.", "Whether it their kid or not, they were the adult in charge at the time. And you're right, the kid isn't going to die with exposed legs. But 18 degrees is pretty frigid and it's fairly reckless to let a kid go out in that weather with shorts. I mean what happens if the worst case scenario happens, and they're stuck outside or somewhere without heat?", "I guess. I used to sometimes wear shorts in weather like that when I was a teenager as did many of my friends. I don't recall anyone ever getting frostbite or hypothermia. But maybe I underestimate the risk.", "Yeah, that's a good point about bringing pants. It's like having sneakers in the car in case you break down.", "I kept two sweatshirts at school for this reason. 3rd floor? Roasting hot, no sweatshirt needed, push your sleeves up. 2nd floor? Long sleeves are fine. 1st floor? Need the first sweatshirt for sure! Basement? Both sweatshirts, magic gloves too.", "The teacher kept saying that if she let my kid not wear a coat, no one would because she is a leader and kids followed her example. Sorry, lady, she's 4. If she wields greater influence in your classroom than you, retire or quit picking stupid fights.", "Im already having this fight with my 8yo. Took him to school today same temp and half the kids were playing out front in shorts. It\u2019s like they can\u2019t admit to eachother they own pants\u2026 or coats", "The kid is cold. Again, if theres a potential they could be outside for hours without help, I will change my mind. But in most places in the US, there is no practical *danger* from having bare shins at 18F. The risk is that the kid will be cold, not that they will be injured by the cold.", "I was that child that always refused to wear a coat and was always sick hahaha", "There is potential. My wife was taking our kid to an indoor extracurricular activity and kid refused to dress for the inclement weather enroute. Wouldn't you know it- they were struck by another car and were stuck outside for over an hour without heat.", "Nah. Being cold doesn't have anything to do with getting sick.\n\nBesides hypothermia and frostbite, anyway.", "And... they got frostbite and/or hypothermia because it was bitter cold and no one rendered aid?\n\nOr they had to deal with feeling cold?\n\nI am not saying that there isn't a time and place where bundling up for safety is important, or even that it wouldn't have been smarter to bring warm clothes or a blanket. But this kid's mom's boyfriend made a big deal out of not wearing pants for the drive to school, just in case he had to be outside for a little while. Unless there are extenuating circumstances here, it feels like an overstep to \"put his foot down.\" Save that shit for when it matters. Make a suggestion and let the kid deal with uncomfortable consequences if they arise."]}
