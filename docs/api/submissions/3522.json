Getting into what if's with a teenager is often a losing game, especially when some of yours don't make sense (if there is a fire drill, he goes out wearing whatever he has on. They're not going to let him stop for his pants)\n\n2. He's 14. There has to be space for ill fated teenage decisions so he can experience natural consequences (plus the number of teenage/college age boys I have seen running around in shorts in a Canadian winter really makes me wonder how bothered he would have been).", "NTA. But.... when my son was 14, it was shorts all the time, with a hoodie. Now it's joggers and a long sleeve shirt. They go through moods. Really is a pick your battles thing....", "NAH. He\u2019s old enough to make his own choice on whether he\u2019s cold or not. A solution to all those reasonable concerns you have is to have him pack a pair of trousers in his backpack in case\n\nETA spelling", "NTA. You were trying, but at this age\u2026pick your battles, my friend. And maybe put some emergency gear in your car: blanket, snacks, water to plan around those edge cases. It\u2019s just not worth the fight. My son didn\u2019t wear a coat to school from about 7th grade on. We just bought him his first parka for his freshman year in college.", "Info: OP the 18 degree weather, thats Fahrenheit yes?", "Canadian weighing in.... You are not ridiculous. I've been in situations where a fire alarm went off unplanned in the middle of winter. I've slid off the road because of black ice. I've also just been fucking cold.\n\nYou weren't saying no to the shorts, you just wanted him to find a weather appropriate compromise.\n\nNTA... You're a good parent (step or otherwise)", "NTA. Kid is out in near frostbite weather, shorts are definitely not appropriate for that condition", "Your definitely NTA. Anxiety and preparation are 2 different things. What if you get stranded on the way to school? You'd have a teenage stepson in the middle of 18 degree weather with no pants on. You've assumed a father figure role for this entire family, and with that comes the responsibility of keeping your family protected and safe. Same thing goes for the mother. I'd explain that to her. The fact that she wanted you to let her son wear shorts in 18 degree weather is absurd. You prepared for the worst case scenario in order to keep him safe, u ain't the asshole man.", "NTA\n\nBut not for most reasons being mentioned here. The kids mom left you in charge of parental duties that morning. If she trusts you enough to give you this responsibility then she should back up your parenting. Instead she undermined you. The right way to have handled this would have been for her to tell you in private that it\u2019s ok if you let a 14YO be a little bit of an idiot and wear the shorts but she should have told the 14 YO that when you are on parenting duty then you have to listen without being argumentative. Wearing pants in freezing weather is a reasonable request and you were trying to handle the situation to the best of your ability.", "NAH.  Of course \u201cput some pants on\u201d is the common sense suggestion in 18 degree weather, but there\u2019s only so much you can do to talk common sense into someone who insists on wearing shorts in 18 degree weather in the first place, especially when you add a dose of teenage stubbornness on top of that.", "NAH.\n\nBut clothes are not worth your battle. So long as they're in dress code, I don't worry. I have a 12 year old... she'll wear hoodies when it's 85 and short sleeves when it's 40. Teenagers are weird.

I live where it can go into the negatives with the wind and always make sure I have an extra jacket or something\n\n\nMaybe an alternative is he just packs the pants with him?

They walked to school, since I was at work by the time they would go. I got a couple calls from the school, and said \"i get you want to wear shorts. That's fine.

There have been some very constructive comments on here and I am taking them in stride. I feel like I might a little bit be TA but only because of his age. He is 14 and although I think it\u2019s very stupid to wear shorts in the weather we have here, this is not a situation where I should put my foot down and fight this fight. I do have emergency supplies in my car, including a blanket, so I will just rely on that if something does arise. He\u2019s old enough to make his own decisions. Thank you all for the input.", "NTA for asking him, but at 14 he needs to learn about consequences. Google why does my son wear shorts in winter....interesting article. What is is doing is not unusual.", "NTA you're teaching him. Winter is all about the layers. It's 10 degrees outside right now and I dropped my daughter off at school. She's wearing leggings under her jeans with the understanding that she can take the jeans off when she wants to and change into her regular shoes that are packed in her bag. \n\nI tried for mittens buuutt she refused and as we walked up to the building was mentioning how cold her fingers were. \n\nGranted my daughter is 6, not 14.

Let him chose what clothes he wears. If you're worried about the car breaking down, take a blanket in the car.\n\nYou mean well, and we all agree that your suggestion to wear pants is sensible, but the kid is 14. This is one of those times when he can learn things for himself. If his legs get a bit chapped from the cold, that will be a useful lesson. There isn't really a realistic scenario where he'll end up with frostbite so bad that his legs have to be amputated.\n\nNAH", "YTA, he\u2019s 14 not 4.

I figure it's his knees and if he can't handle his choice he'll ask me for long pants. He hasn't so I let his knees and shins suffer the weather.\n\nAlso you're not the kid's parent.

We had many student workers. One student worker in particular was KNOWN for wearing shorts when it snows. It was his thing. He was killed in an automobile accident in spring 2020 weeks before he graduated with his bachelor's in Architecture and was set to travel to Europe to kick off his internship before returning to obtain his masters in Architecture. I'll always think about him when I see someone wearing shorts in the snow. \n\nYour reasons aren't unjust - a compromise would have been to carry a pair of pants in the car. Let your kid dress himself. He's old enough. \n\nNTA - but you will be if you keep fighting with your teen over silly things. Fight about not doing drugs or sneaking out to go drink alcohol in a farm field somewhere. Shorts are silly. Let him be silly.", "YTA, but also new to parenting. It would be different if he was 4, but this is just a teenager thing. I also refused to wear a winter coat until my mid-20s, but have no real idea why. Every teen boy in my neighborhood goes out shoveling snow in shorts, and now I just laugh at them as I drive by in my many layers. Very low chance of frost bite/hypothermia or getting sick unless you live miles from civilization. They'll figure it out eventually.", "Wearing shorts with a collared shirt, tie and jacket looks ridiculous", "He may be 14 but he's still your responsibility, especially if he gets sick while on your \"watch\", and you offered a reasonable compromise (shorts indoors, pants outside). **NTA**", "slightly YTA, I think u should have just let him wear the shorts and the worst case scenario is he gets sick and will hopefully learn from the experience next time he wants to dress inappropriately for the weather", "YTA. And I bet he acted that way because you're not his parent. What else does mom's live in boyfriend put his foot down for? Do you always discipline her children or do you just feel like it's your manly duty to teach?  And maybe I'm saying this because I have personal feelings about the matter since I myself was subjected to my mother's boyfriend thinking he could come in and boss me around. It ended up to the point where I got really mouthy and he threw me in the shower. It was horrifying and my relationship with him (and mom) never improved because of it. If only he had tried to be my friend instead of my superior...", "YTA. Not because of the merit of your arguments, but because it isn\u2019t your place to father her kids.

Pants are TA. You're NTA.", "Softly YTA but with good intentions. This is not a fight worth having. This same kid may try to wear a hoodie when it's 100 degrees outside.

I grew up in winters in the Midwest, by the way. \n\nLet it go. If he ever has an emergency, he'll learn firsthand himself. If it makes you feel better, keep an extra pair of sweatpants in the trunk for him as a just in case. Hopefully you'll never experience a situation where it's needed. But in the event that you ever do, I imagine that moment will be a teaching lesson for him. lol", "This is not the hill you want to die on.   He's old enough to learn of he gets cold....and you being a nervous nelly about things that 'might' happen in theory is going to color the rest of your relationship with your soon to be step son.   Is that what you want?  It's shorts....not a damn moral or legal issue.", "NAH BUT he\u2019s a teen and he can make his own decisions on what to wear, if he want to wear shorts in the winter let him, tell him to at least pack pants just in case but don\u2019t push him on it, he will learn quick himself if he gets cold and will wear appropriate clothing from now on, if you push the issue on something so insignificant then as a teen he will just push back and cause unnecessary fights", "You're not an asshole for it, but tbh natural consequences are probably the best way for a teenager to learn shorts in the snow is a bad idea. He's not going to be outside long enough to risk hypothermia in them, and tbh the number of girls in that sort of climate who continue to wear skirts in the winter is high, this isn't unusual. I've definetly worn a skirt in that weather in December to school and got caught outside due to a false fire alarm for an hour, I didn't die.", "Yta look, there are just some kids, mostly boys, who wear shorts year round. I do not understand it. \n\nBut this is part of his bodily autonomy.  It's not harmful, just kind dumb.", "YTA because this is not your kid and he is 14 and old enough to make his own decision about this issue. If he got cold then he would learn to wear pants next time. But the bigger issue is that you are not his parent. You are not even his stepparent. Stop parenting him.", "YTA. He\u2019s fourteen. Let him dress however he chooses. If he is cold, he\u2019ll learn to dress more appropriately for the weather in the future.", "YTA for overstepping with your girlfriend's son. In all seriousness, what's the worst that happens? He gets chilly for a little while. Unless you live in the wilderness where there is a real possibility of sliding into a ditch and having to hike to find a cell signal, bare shins in cold weather is mildly inconvenient. Did you grow up in a cold area? I used to wear shorts to the bus stop when it was colder than that. I think you're right, it would have been objectively less risky overall to have him wear pants, but... not your kid, man, and there wasn't any real risk of bodily harm here.\n\nNext time, just quietly take a pair of sweats in your cold weather kit in your car, so you can be the 'hero' if an emergency does come to pass.\n\nAlso, if you were scared for this child's long term health in this scenario, then yeah - you might be projecting some anxiety onto the situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The problem is you're not the parent. That's his mom.

If he'd worn shorts to school, his mom would be getting a call from the Principle.\n\nI think that if your \"scenarios\" were meant as more than a rhetorical tactic, then yeah, you were being melodramatic.  Using imagery to make yourself more persuasive with kids is completely fine - but an adult actually believing that you need to finish your dinner because kids are starving in Africa is a little silly.\n\nThe main reason kids need to wear warm clothing to school in November is because of social norms.  Schools have heaters and no one ever froze to death walking from their Dad's car to homeroom.  If an outfit is warm enough for your living room, there's no practical reason that it wouldn't be warm enough for Mr. Jorgenson's algebra class.\n\nThat doesn't mean it is okay to drop your kid off at school in shorts when there is snow on the ground!  Basic social norms about clothing for kids are mostly good.  There's all sorts of inappropriate or bizarre clothing that kids shouldn't be dressed in - and the reasons are primarily social, not practical.

I remember being a kid and feeling overheated even when it was winter (below 32 F)", "I think the biggest reason why this is a thing is because it\u2019s *super* common for buildings to overcompensate for the cold weather by blasting the heat as much as possible. And, for a lot of people (including, well\u2026 me.), switching suddenly from cold to warm can be pretty miserable, if not *painful*. \n\nIn my case, I used to always wear shorts to school because I KNEW that, if I were to wear pants, then I\u2019d end up spending the entire first period feeling sick, sweaty, itchy, swollen, and claustrophobic. Like\u2026 I had to stop wearing jeans because my body couldn\u2019t handle the temperature change and it would genuinely *become difficult to breathe.*\n\nShorts under pants is\u2026 ok, I guess.

It\u2019d also mean that he\u2019d have to carry around a bulky pair of pants the whole day, which is going to make his backpack bulge embarrassingly.

It has to be significantly into the negatives before the risk of frostbite wouldn't be mitigated simply by being active and staying dry, likely enough so that if it was they wouldn't be sending them to school to begin with.", "I agree if the car gets stuck and they are stranded for any amount if time.", "Dude this was a major problem I had while working after school child care. Like so many people would come up to me, the adult watching the kids, and try to go after me about not forcing the kids to wear their coats.\n\nIf they are cold, they come right back inside and put that coat on. There's no reason for me to stress out my throat and pop a vein in my forehead fighting with them when they are going to learn more about their body regulation through experience.

Then realized that the only time they were outside was going to and from home, car,school, car, and home again.
