You can't tell a blatant lie that anyone could fact check like that so part of me is like he's a dumbass for that one.

But I would have done the same thing, if that\u2019s any consolation.", "to the under 30 you are NTA, to the rest YTA \n\nI am sure you feel he \"deserved\" it, and technically you didnt do anything wrong. I would recommend caution invoking the karma fairy she tends to enjoy coming back around", "YTA, you got a dude fired because he was a smart-aleck. I mean sure you didnt mean to fire him like that, but the net result of your actions resulted in getting him fired when he didnt do anything for you. He was just being a dumbass, and you lost an old man his job, knowing full well that the qualifications were suspect. If he wasnt qualified, then he would be eventually fired anyway, because ability shows itself, and lack of also does, you didnt need to butt in", "I'm willing to bet he was talking about the recent forgiveness of some student loan debt in the US.", "He was making a point about the student loan forgiveness going back on the tax payers", "Lol. How did Steve fool all those people for years?", "exactly, he was a dumbass for being stupid, but OP full well knew that something was off and decided to publicly expose them for it for no reason other than OP was offended.

Fooling them was the least of Steve's worries.", "While we don\u2019t know specifics about Steve, I think we can assume he\u2019s an over estimated mediocre white man failing purposefully upwards. I\u2019m not at all surprised he got away with it as long as he had.", "I think that's why it doesn't sit well with me. Because I know someone in my office (she no longer works there thank god) that I would want to hurt in a manner like this if I could. I know it sounds mean and awful and that's because it is. It would be embarrassing for her and 97% of all the employees would be happy to see her come down a few pegs (she was a **monster** -- multiple HR reports, but she played the R-card with the DM so she was untouchable). \n\nBut, it would still be like...well if *I* personally thought she was doing something unethical...why didn't I go to HR with my suspicions? You are specfically taught that anything you *think* is unethical, you go to HR and HR handles it from there. OP didn't *have* to say anything to Steve in public if it was just for an ethical reason. But, OP chose to. Steve comes off like he absolutely deserved it. And because if I had chosen to do something like that to the woman at my job, I would think I'm an asshole too. I dunno how to judge this because I am so torn. Does that make sense?", "I have a degree but rarely use skills learned in school. There are occasional times I need to calculate something, but nothing that can\u2019t be googled. In fact, I don\u2019t remember 90% of the formulas and have to look them up anyways. Most of my skills come from working in the industry through college. \n \nEven when doing the math would be appropriate, I usually just overestimate (fancy term is \u201csafety factor\u201d) whats needed.\n \nHonestly some people off the street could do half my job. The other they\u2019d pick up within a year of starting.", "I think it depends on how OP asked it. We're they being malicious and asking in that sickly sweet tone hoping for an outcome like this? Or was it more like built up frustration and along the lines of I'll embarrass him? Only OP can answer it and only OP will really know if they were being vicous when they asked. Honestly OP didn't say much as far as what he has done to make things a nightmare for her so kind of hard to judge if he deserves it or not. I mean technically it was an AH thing to do but it may have been justified. He's also an idiot for lying on his resume and not remembering or keeping up his lie.", "NTA. He deliberately lied to her that job. Not remotely your fault.", "TA.  You took the extra time to snoop about a co-worker and then at the next opportunity you outed him to management.  You try to setup the defense for your actions by generically saying that Steve has \"been a nightmare\" since you started your internship a few years ago, but you really give no description of what being a \"nightmare\" is aside from a snarky comment he made.  Now, if you said he sexually harassed you, picked a fight in the parking lot, or something else crazy, I could understand, but you basically admit to just not liking the guy."]}
