I'm posting on here because I need people's opinions on this. It's so fucking stupid and such a non-issue, (unless I'm wrong about that too) that turned into something bigger. \n\nFor reference, this happened on Thursday evening. We are all in our early 20s and all names are fake.\n\nThursday was our friend \"Sarah's\" birthday. To celebrate, our friend group decided to go out for dinner. There were about 10 of us. Everyone was in a good mood and it was really nice to just talk to everybody about whatever for hours, especially since I kind of had a stressful week.\n\nHours into the dinner, we landed on the topic of movies/TV shows that we were watching. Our friend \"Amy\" mentioned a show that I had also watched. As soon as she brought it up, I said that I really liked the show, and that the acting, writing and directing was top notch. \"Mary\" chimed in and said that she really didn't like the show and how she had been watching other things. Cool. To each their own. Mary then asked me how I felt about the main romantic pairing in the show. I responded that I liked it, and thought the romance was cute. This is where the drama started.\n\nFor context, I don't want to get too much into it because it might be confusing, but basically, the main romantic pairing is between the male lead and the female lead. There are some people who have interpreted that these characters to be related to each other. I do not. But I know that people are free to think whatever they want, and honestly thought that this topic was harmless. Well, I was wrong.\n\nMary took offense to me saying that I liked the romance. She asked me if I supported incest. I said of course not, as the characters are not related. She said that they ARE related and that me supporting their pairing is supporting incest. Mary then said that I should \"educate\" myself before saying \"stupid shit\". I was dumbfounded and thought she was joking but she was REALLY angry with me about this. She told me to rethink my values because supporting incest makes me a horrible person. I told her she was making harmful accusations over a TV show. Our other friends were telling her to stop, including Sarah, but she kept claiming that I was a disgusting incest supporter. She then claimed I was homophobic, since the male lead is bisexual but still ended up with a woman. Mary just wouldn't stop saying shit like this.\n\nSo here is where I may be the asshole. I left Sarah's dinner. My friends were asking me to stay but I felt uncomfortable, so I paid for what I ordered and left. Many of my friends reached out to me on Friday to ask if I was okay. Some of them, while they understood why I was upset, said that it was wrong of me to leave Sarah's birthday dinner and that I should have just ignored what Mary was saying and stuck around. I feel like they may be right and that I may have ruined her birthday by getting up and leaving, but I felt like I couldn't stay because of Mary throwing accusations at me over something that doesn't matter.

You might actually expect bi people to be in a relationship with someone of the opposite gender significantly more often than half the time. If you're a bi man, then your set of possible partners are (for the sake of argument, and there's some simplification of sexuality here) gay men, bi men, bi women, and straight women.

Getting this bent out of sorts over a TV show is deranged. It's fictional.\n\nIt's even okay to root for the villains in many cases. It would be weird if you did that for a Law and Order: SVU episode, but if you like Thanos or the Joker because they're larger than life characters, that's fine. No one is actually getting hurt.\n\nHonestly, being rude to her in the moment would be fine. \"Did your parents not teach you that TV shows are make believe?\" is an appropriate thing to say to someone acting like that.", "Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker had a little something going on too. And that didn't kill the *Star Wars* franchise, FFS. It creeped me the heck out when it was revealed. But, then I got over myself. I don't have to internalize fiction unless I want to.\n\nNTA. I'd have told Mary to stop projecting and remove the stick from her bum.", "Imagine having so few problems that she feels the need to impotently shit her pants with rage over fictional incest. If modern porn has taught me anything, that fantasy is everywhere. Doesn\u2019t mean anyone intends to act on it. \n\nIn fact, the Stepsister nonsense is most often enjoyed by people with no siblings at all", "Knowing that the show is Loki helps as that clarifies the ambiguous interpretation of whether they're related. Here's my judgment as both a bisexual and a survivor of incestuous child abuse:\n\nFirst, Mary's claims that Loki ending up with a woman is homophobic are an insulting attempt at bi-erasure. Loki is canonically bi. Romancing a woman is valid. Romancing a man is valid. Neither one is in conflict with his bisexuality. Mary's stance on this is honestly biphobic.\n\nSecond, I don't personally find the Loki/Sylvie pairing to be incestuous or even really self-cest? There can be philosophical debate about it, but they are shown to be different people with different character arcs and motivations who grew up in very different circumstances. Regardless of being alternate dimensional versions of the same individual, they are really quite different. I also found their pairing/that one kiss to be more of an internal conflict resolution than an external romantic resolution. They do not really \"end up together\" and I think what happens between them can be seen as part of Loki's character growth in which he lets go of his deep self-loathing that has motivated him for so long.\n\nAgain, debate is possible here. I don't think this is any kind of clear case of supporting incest (not like, say, some Harry Potter fans who are really into interpreting the Weasley twins as a romantic couple). I think Mary may have some deeply personal reasons to feel sensitive about this that she may not wish to share. Hell, I don't share my history openly, just within the anonymous confines of reddit. Or also, she could just be reactionary to what she's been told is a thing to be offended by (like with the homophobia comment). I don't think we can know for sure. Either way, OP is NTA.", "IF they ever hooked up, it would not be incest.\n\n\nIt's masturbation", "Mary needs to go outside. IMMEDIATELY. She's so deep into online/fandom discourse.

Tell her you left because you were upset and you would have made her party worse if you had stayed arguing.", "If possible take Sarah out to do something fun, to compensate for you leaving. \n\nAnd just stick to avoiding Mary, hopefully others give up on her as well.", "ESH, the biggest AH is Mary. I'm wondering if she has some kind of trauma around incest because she is indeed taking it way too seriously. If not, her behavior and accusations towards you were crazy and she is the biggest AH. \n\nit is however very uncool to make Sarah's birthday party about you by leaving. So therefore, sir, you are also an AH. However, a much smaller one because I get that you wanted to get away from the craziness", "Mary clearly had an underlying problem with you to get all fired up by this and not being able to calm herself or even listen to your friends telling her to stop.\nAnd you're not wrong you owe it to yourself to take care of your mental health and image that mary clearly was attacking by her many accusations.", "You\u2019re talking about different versions of oneself in the multiverse\u2026 considering the multiverse as marvel has presented it is completely fictional, it does not rise to the understood definition of incest\u2026\n\nA better question for Mary is if she even understands the entire social taboo around incest to begin with.

I do hope that someone close to Mary will gently nudge her toward counseling.  It could be that rather than just coming on like a self-righteous blowhard, the reason she sees incest support where it doesn't exist and becomes somewhat unhinged is that she's been traumatized.

So really it is one of those things where yeah it is weird if you think about it a lot, but the goal of a lot of these superhero franchises is to create debates.
