But he powered through the *infinite* heartbreak of that tragedy to give you the best childhood he could, never failing to honor her memory even as he finally healed enough to move on and find love again.

The fact that she supports you, is kind and loving with you, and stood up to her parents along with you tells me everything I need to know.

He not only told me I will go my way through life, and he trusts me on my choices. That wasn't even it, although thinking of it makes me feel warm and fuzzy. It was when I saw my daughter getting a bit uneasy, and he asked to get to hold her, and then he made stupid sounds and faces and she laughed much! In this second I realised he learned how to calm babies with me. It was me who he held like her, who was calmed by him. He made some weird sounds, and then she settled to calm down completely, being at ease in his hands.\n\nAnd I felt held too. 22 years, and I understood how much he had loved me from when I was little.\n\nYour dad loves you so, so much.
