Dad started dating a little when I was 11 and he met my stepmom when I was 12. She and I got along really well from the start.

My stepmom has told them it's none of their business and dad has said he's not bothered by what they say because he has heard it before, on many occasions, because people often tried to set him up before he was ready and encouraged him to find someone who could fill the mother figure role I was missing.\n\nIt bothers me a lot because they will talk like I am some devastated kid who never moved on from not knowing my mom and who had this really bad life with a longing for a mom to come and raise me.

I told them I am painfully aware that my mom died before I knew her and I am very much aware she didn't get to raise me but I grew up perfectly and I would not change a thing about how dad handled it once my mom died. They told me I felt that way because I didn't want to admit dad denied me the most precious thing ever. I told them if they continued to harass my dad about this stuff, then they would not be welcome to my future milestones, like graduation and when I get married, because they are disrespecting the parent who gave me a wonderful life after we lost my mom. They were angry. My stepmom told them I was right and they were taking advantage of the fact my dad didn't care and didn't want her to cut them off for the way they treated him.
