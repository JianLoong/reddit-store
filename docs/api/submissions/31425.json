Some people are brought up that you go get people flying into airports.. for us it\u2019s 1.5-2 hours down towards the city.   It just isn\u2019t required to be a good mate in this world. You do need to figure out if your financial plan is a long term plan or not. You cannot imagine she is taking advantage of that situation, despite that is what is happening to some degree in most relationships that have it. Best of luck.", "His immediate response was \"I'm going to be up, anyway.\"  But no, the flight's later - 6:30 is when I'd have to be at the airport, and also when he usually leaves for work.

Most men wound up depending on their partner to do something like their laundry, cooking them meals, taking over their parenting duties at night with babies and kids,\u2026solely handling household shopping and errands and management, etc. and most women will\u2026but most of us agree that fucking sucks. With two adults present, it\u2019s never just one adults responsibility but it usually wounds up being so\u2026even if one parent is a stay at home parent. \n\nThat\u2019s just an example \n\nIt could literally be anything, though, and some girls are just so in love they won\u2019t tell you it fucking sucks because they love you enough to just do it.", "then why are you still with her? and there\u2019s ways to say facts nicer, you were just plain mean", "NTA...\n\n1) So her 90 minutes is worth more than your 90 minutes (to her).

Does she put in what you do in terms of time, effort, money, etc into the relationship?", "YTA.  \n\nIf you had offered to pay for it, for your own convenience, I would have had a different answer.  The only reason she has to pay is that her boyfriend can't be bothered to do her the normal favor of driving her to the airport.  \n\nAs for the \"all expense paid\" trip - look you didn't have to do that, and if you resent doing it to this degree maybe you should rethink this relationship.", "That's a dumb excuse for her to go.

Then I don\u2019t understand why you would default to asking them to change the flight to make sure it works for your husband. The default option would be to get them to pay for taxi.

Why make an issue of it?\n\nOnce the GF made an issue of her BF not coming and collecting her then flowers, chocolates etc IS an apology and IS rewarding that sort of behaviour.

I will push back a little, though:\n\n- The reason she has to pay is because she is taking a flight and it is part of her transportation costs. Not because of any failure on my part.
