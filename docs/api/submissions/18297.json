To clarify we joked about it in the past but I\u2019m actually involved with someone at the job. I politely/quietly asked her twice to stop and third time I had to yell as historically that\u2019s the only times she hears me. She keeps saying I don\u2019t communicate but when I do she chooses not to listen and thinks I\u2019m trying to \u201ccheck\u201d her why waste my time talking if you think I\u2019m just attacking you. To explain I have alexithymia so I sort through my feelings then bring it up especially since everything I bring up she wants to argue about it.\n\nI am talking to someone on the floor, she knows because that\u2019s the first reason I gave for her to stop and she did yesterday then did it again today. Yesterday I said stop and she did and apologized, today she tried to tell another coworker I\u2019m pregnant I told her to stop before she even said the words, I spoke over her as she\u2019s saying the words, and then she decides to tell her again then I got upset and snapped at her and left. I had to raise my voice and curse for you to hear and listen when I say stop lying and saying I\u2019m pregnant in front of the entire workforce? She also knows I\u2019d rather die then have a kid or be pregnant at this age.\n\nAfter I left, I texted her letting her know I should not have tell you multiple times to stop saying something. She tried to talk to me about on the floor thinking I\u2019ll shy away no bitch we\u2019ll talk so we argued and I admit I should not have yelled but she literally said if I don\u2019t want to be accused of being pregnant not to be sick/nauseous\u2026 that made me lose my cool because she knows I\u2019m taking medicine it makes me sick im supposed to magically stop being sick? She then said I thought you do not care what people thinks so if for the first time I\u2019m asking you not to say something that means it\u2019s important. And then she argues you poke me and when I say stop you don\u2019t and we do that to each other me acting annoying that is not equivalent to you spreading a malicious rumor like a jackass.\n\nNow if I mention while she has a girlfriend that she continuously cheats on, she asked the supervisor (41M) to pay her to have sex or trying to fuck another supervisor (38F) that also has girlfriend then I\u2019m wrong.\n\nI actually yelled at her at work, I did not let her indiscretions be known to everyone\u2026 yet. Everyone says she is wrong but I should not have reacted that way and should have just walked off, and she stands by it was just a joke\u2026in my opinion it is only a joke if both parties find it funny which I told you I do not\u2026 what that was is a malicious rumor at my expense I\u2019m not here to be the victim for your amusement. \n\nSo AITA for my reaction?", "created_utc": 1685186826, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t4xha/aita_for_my_reaction_to_my_friend_telling_the/", "score": 227, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She IS HARRASSING YOU and creating a TOXIC WORKPLACE!  TAKE THIS TO HR immediately. There have to be consequences for the ahs who act like this at work.  \n\nAlso, SHE IS NOT YOUR FRIEND because friends help, support, and care for you...not TELL LIES in the main floor of your workplace where everybody can hear HER TELLING LIES ABOUT YOU. Ditch her as a friend and start talking to your manager or HR person because this is not only creating a toxic environment FOR YOU, others are watching her TELL LIES and if she doesn't get in trouble for LYING about a coworker, the other employees WON'T TRUST management to keep them safe.
