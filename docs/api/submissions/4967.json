I am 24 and my fianc\u00e9 is 23, we will be getting married over the summer but we\u2019ve been living together since September. We are financially independent, having full time jobs. My fianc\u00e9 has overbearing parents that are quick to anger/judge. They hated me before they ever met me and only decided to finally meet me and \u201cgive me a chance\u201d about 1.5yrs into our relationship. We currently have an arms-length, civil relationship with his parents and sister. His sister is 19 and has a retail job 9-5. \n\nNow to the story. We are going out of town for the weekend, and asked his parents to watch his dog and they happily agreed. I asked his sister if she could drop by one morning and feed my cats before work, and I\u2019d pay her $20 to do it. She happily agreed. \n\nFast forward, I texted her on Friday morning and asked if she could come by after work (all three of us get off at 5pm) and see how the cats are fed and where their food is and also to grab the key to our house and the key fob for the gate (gated community). She didn\u2019t reply all day, so I got worried and had my fianc\u00e9 call his mom to ask if his sister was still willing/able to feed the cats. She said yes, she\u2019s still willing to and she\u2019s just a really bad texter (texting gives her anxiety so she usually just doesn\u2019t reply to people according to his mom). She assured us his sister would be in contact. \n\nI still hadn\u2019t heard from her by 8:30, which is when we go to bed (we commute to work so have to be up at 6am). So I hired my usual sitter because she knows where everything is and left the key in a lockbox on the porch. We texted his mom not to worry about it, we were able to get our usual sitter. His mom was upset and said his sister was eventually going to reach out. \n\nI just feel like I need to be able to communicate easily with the person feeding my babies!! If she had reached out, I could\u2019ve given her the key and shown her where stuff is this morning or even on FaceTime but she never reached out. Until 11pm that night after I\u2019d fallen asleep when she apologized. I told her it was okay it just didn\u2019t work out and not to feel bad. No response from her. His mother told him, angrily,  on the phone this morning that his sister was upset over it and she would\u2019ve been happy to do it. \n\nWas it too short of a notice to get her to come by? I do maybe feel bad but I also don\u2019t really have any trust built with them yet.

If she can't communicate, it's not a good fit. Just stick to the regular sitting moving forward. And try not to have hard feelings with SiL. Anxiety is a horrible thing to deal with, so she probably already feels bad.", "NTA. \n\nYou gave her more than enough time to respond.

It's great you had a back up.  SIL needs to work on her communication skills.  NTA", "My daughter is s professional cat sitter.  We sometimes call her a cat whisperer because she\u2019s so good at making friends quickly with strange cats, but she says an extremely important part of the job is communicating well with the humans.  She texts them updates and pictures while they\u2019re gone, and they love it.  Your SIL fell down on a very important component of the task.  NTA", "ESH. The deal was between you and SIL. Why did you run to her mommy? Keep it between you two. Of course you\u2019re N T A for solving the problem a different way when she didn\u2019t say whether or not she could come learn how to do it. Maybe you waited too long but either way you didn\u2019t have wiggle room here. But to go and tell on her and get your MIL in the middle of it when it\u2019s already strained with her is just a rookie \nmove. The MIL shouldn\u2019t have flown off the handle but you\u2019re the one who pulled her into this.", "Thank you, I needed to hear this", "I have no hard feels at all, I made sure to text her that. I have really bad anxiety too (in fact we have a diagnosis in common of OCD w/ intrusive thoughts) so I know how it feels. It was a little frustrating, but definitely nothing to get mad at her over because I had a backup sitter. It was just worrying to me when everyone got upset at me over it that I\u2019d done something wrong. I just don\u2019t trust her enough yet.", "She's 19 and holding down a job. She's *perfectly capable* of responding to a text. Why on earth is her mum enabling this nonsense. Sis needs to learn that her actions have consequences. Can't believe she's upset over something she caused that required so little effort to do in the first place. Very odd behavior. NTA", "NTA. She needs to learn to communicate.", "Stupid stuff. Silence is unacceptable in this situation. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA", "Yeah, if a cat had gotten out or something random had happened would SIL have told anyone or would she have frozen up?  You can't be sure.", "NTA. Pets, kids or house. You need the sitter to be someone you can reach and will reach back in a Timely manner.", "NTA you wanted time to show her where things were she didn't bother to reply a quick ok would have been fine\n\nEdit typo", " NTA. No way your SIL could be trusted to be responsible or accessible enough to take care of your kitties. As for MIL, she can butt out.", "You could have left the cats alone.  Whenever I travel, I set up large water and food containers along with extra litter boxes.  They have been fine up to 10 days!!!!", "Sorry if this is judgmental or anything but who gets anxiety from texting?! And even if she does get it, why not call or ask to meet up? Sounds like a lame excuse and maybe some weird power move. NTA.", "NTA. You needed to be certain that your fur kids were going to be safe and looked after by someone who is responsible and reliable. Your fianc\u00e9's sister showed through lack of communication that she was neither of those things.", "NTA. If texting gives her anxiety, she could have cAlled. If communication in general is too anxiety inducing for her, she\u2019s not fit for the job.", "NTA. Quick and reliable communication is important when it comes to pets. What if her text anxiety impeded her from asking you important questions or contacting you about an emergency regarding your cats? \n\nThat said, if maintaining a civil relationship with your in-laws is important to you, perhaps an olive branch you could extend is inviting SIL over to spend an evening with the cats? Most of the joy of cat-sitting is getting to interact with the little guys. That said it isn't your job to placate her or your husband's parents either, so this is an optional side quest.", "Next time, don't even bother with MIL.  Restrict your texts/calls to the relevant person.", "NTA. I am currently house/pet sitting for s friend. I respond quickly when she messages me. Why? Because she has entrusted me with her loved pet and her home. That\u2019s a big deal.", "Guess I\u2019m different, but if I\u2019m doing something for someone I will call them to double check specifics. Honestly unless your SIL is a child, there is no reason you should have had to jump through hoops to communicate with her. I wouldn\u2019t ask her or fianc\u00e9s family to do anything else for me. I\u2019d make a point to never rely on them. NTA, and MIL will get over it", "NTA. HUGE NTA. Our pets are an extension of ourselves, they are our family and to most like children. If someone was supposed to be looking after a kid but AWFUL at communicating they would no longer be looking after said kid. Same goes for pets and IMO plants (proud plant mama here)", "Not my cats. One of them is special needs, and they get wet food so I can\u2019t just leave them with a giant container of food.

Not sure i'd even trust her with watering plants.\n\nDon't feel bad about your choice(except maybe having asked her in the first place).  Your future MIL is just looking for reasons to fuel her dislike.\n\nPlus you were kind in your explanation to her when she did call.", "NTA.  She didn't respond in a timely fashion.  There was no way for you to know her plans if she was not communicating with you.  Going forward be cautious of expecting anything from her. She seems to be relying on her mother to communicate for her.  That's weird for someone her age imo.", "NTA\n\nBut did you ever think of just using your phone and calling her since you know she doesn't text?", "I wouldn't give her another chance. She's  undependable and unreasonable. NTA OP.", "I don't believe that someone has anxiety for texting. In any case, why didn't you call and speak? Phones were invited to be able to talk, not texting.", "My 83-year-old neighbor who has bad eyesight and a flip phone (I KNOW!) responds to texts. If he can, anyone can.", "Like herding cats ;)", "I'm literally a (previous) pet sitter with diagnosed social anxiety who gets pretty bad anxiety from texting.  \nYeah, it sucks to worry about every little thing you could say being wrong, or how people will think about you.  \nBut I still always updated and kept in communication with my clients, because it was my job, and you don't have a choice but to push through and get over it and be an adult.  \n\n\nHonestly, she let you down here. You have every right to give the job to someone you trust who will communicate with you. Hopefully she learns to push through and do better in the future.  \n\n\nNTA", "This is not responsible pet owner behaviour.", "Well, now you know what happens when you do that."]}
