How hard is it to ask a question and be polite?", "ESH\n\nI think of you as being the asshole a little less than him though. He repeatedly sparked up after it being made obvious numerous times that you don't want him sparking up in your place. You just assumed whilst already being aware (basing this on the fact you have been on the receiving end of this/lack of this) that, in general to be polite, considerate and respectful, you should first ensure the people who live there/pay the rent/mortage are ok with the actions you intend to take. I feel like your actions were a bit tit-for-tat, slightly spiteful, fighting fire with fire, etc. Your mate just sounded downright selfish in this particular area of life. I think the way you are handling it though kinda makes up for the assholery I view your actions with though. If these were my actions I wouldn't be paying for any deposit. I would probably make things worse by telling this mate that I haven't treated them or their house any different to how they treat me and my gaff and therefore they should just accept the damage these kinds of actions can have.... like getting evicted. It may help him learn how to treat others and their property with more consideration? It was just particularly unlucky that this one occassion was the one to cause a problem. I think maybe I'm being a bit hard on him and you here, maybe I need more background info, like to understand you both as individuals a bit more and how he normally responds to your requests of not sparking up in your gaff, how to speak to him in those moments, the set up of the gathering and how comfortable you were and then your state of mind when deciding whether to ask etc. and maybe my stance on the matter would be slightly different. But as I currently understand it. He had definitely earned the title of asshole first, because his repeated actions seem very inconsiderate of the effects his actions could have on you and your property, but you've rolled up in second place for assholery because of perhaps nothing more than just a silly mistake not to ask, or because you were just starting to dabble in tit-for-tat and fight-fire-with-fire like actions because his inconsiderate actions are becoming irritating and you otherwise don't know how to change his action/view of the matter. I wouldn't dub you forever an asshole, I get it can be difficult not to give in to the urge to fight-fire-with-fire after so many repeated offenses against ya, we are all human. I guess as a positive, you all may learn a little something from the whole thing.... hopefully your judgement on when it's ok to make assumptions will further improve, you already seem to me, based on this one post and how I've interpretted it, to be quite thoughtful with your reasoning for your actions, maybe this situation will help you learn just how much your default morals and the decisions (split-second decision or well planned out) you make for dealing with issues can become inclined to change based on how you feel after certain interactions/occassions. And maybe your mate will develop his understanding a smidgen bit more in how to be considerate towards others, the effects his actions have on other peoples decision making process, to accept the consequences of his acions (including getting treated by others the same way he treats them) and learn what it feels like getting caught by the bad-luck-bunny when playing risky games.", "ESH.

You assumed it was ok, but you failed to ask, or consider that the neighbor situation could be an issue.

A building would never evict someone because of something a guest very briefly does and they stop when asked. They have been looking for something to kick him out for.\n\nSecond, YTA. In an apartment or condo building, the worst place to smoke is often the balcony. It will go right into the windows of all the neighbors very quickly. When you smoke inside it slowly leaks out and is less intrusive. Most buildings force a lot of air into the hallways so that smells from units don't escape into the rest of the building.", "So the addict gets his friend evicted and then had to ask whether he is to blame..\n\nYta", "YTA, for not asking first.

So it is still covered under the definition for tit-for-tat in my books, but definitely not eye-for-eye which is what I would say smoking in his living room would of been. So, with my understanding of my intended meaning behind my words and my limited understanding of what thoughts and emotions were running through OP's mind when deciding where/when to smoke and if/how to ask, I think it's still a possibility it was tit-for-tat. Plus, it sounds like OP didn't know it was even a smoke-free building though at all (maybe it's because I've visited what sounds to me to be similar types of buildings, but I believe the balcony to be part of the building, so my understanding of \"smoke-free building\" would make my first thought \"I'd have to be outside of the premises or in clearly designated smoking areas before I spark up\") but it lends more weight to the notion that actually it was just a silly assumption that back-fired quickly in this unlucky case.", "That\u2019s what I mean.

The Superbowl was less than a week ago... something fishy is going on.", "This sounds unlikely.", "NTA If he easily lights up at your house, it's pretty safe to think he does all the time at his. He should have let everyone know lighting up was against building rules.", "That sucks but I\u2019m going to have to say NTA\n\nit was fair to assume that would be fine with how he usually smokes. And honestly? I\u2019m not buying that you, a person who doesn\u2019t live there, smoking on the balcony for barely any time could be the sole reason for eviction. \n\nIf you want to help him out with the deposit that would be nice, but I really don\u2019t think you \u201cowe\u201d him anything", "NTA\n\nSmoking outside on the balcony for .2 seconds is not what got him evicted.", "NTA. If this is real and he actually got evicted for it, he smokes inside at his place so many times he got a final warning.", "Isn't there a type of plug-in machine where you blow in the pot smoke and it outputs a non-pot type air?", "NTA\n\nI mean from the title alone you're the asshole but you did at his place what he did at yours, less so even. So no, NTA.\n\nIf it were such an issue then he should have said so sooner. It's not right doing something at someone else's house but not expecting them to do the same at yours.", "If your friend is that comfortable lighting up in your place, even though you've had to force him outside multiple times, then he probably does it all of the time at his place. There was probably more to it than you going outside to light up. Most people in the US don't really care about someone smoking a spliff, a lot of states are actually legal. Also, how is he gonna get evicted if you went outside & weren't even smoking inside the building? Most landlords would actually tell him that you were just banned from the building.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your \"friend\" used you as an excuse", "NTA. He probably had been pissing off that apartment complex already and I bet he\u2019s gotten people complaining about him smoking weed before. If he is that disrespectful at your house, why would you expect him to have rules at his place when he never communicated them to you? Don\u2019t give him money, you don\u2019t get evicted from ONE issue.", "NTA\n\nYou did exactly what he has (repeatedly) done, only you did it as a mistake and he does it on purpose. You can feel bad for him that he's being kicked out, but you have no reason to feel guilty.\n\nAlso, as noted, this is probably a \"last straw\" situation; he's probably been breaking the rules for a while... and now he's trying to take advantage of you to mitigate the consequences of his own actions.", "ESH. A friend in the US (im in Australia) had an apartment which was really strict. But they told me about it. I had had to walk around the block because there was a smoke free zone around the whole complex- they would have been evicted for sure if i smoked anything on the balcony. So the eviction i understand (my building is considering similar for the balconies too) \n\nObviously the friend is an AH for lighting up in OP\u2019s house.", "NTA - I\u2019ve lived in several smoke free buildings. Everyone just smoked on the balcony. As long as they didn\u2019t smoke inside they didn\u2019t care. I feel like he\u2019s lying to you. There\u2019s no way he would get evicted for this, there has to be some other reasons. Or he\u2019s trying to get money out of you for some reason.", "Your husband checks out your sister every time. Bet you he jerks off to her.", "ESH", "Huh. I smell BS or an incomplete story.", "Is this my apartment complex?\n\nSimilar situation is going on in my building - the landlord texted the tenants in our unit two-ish weeks ago that residents have complained of marijuana smell and it's a smoke-free building. The text ended with a warning that if the resident responsible was caught, they'd be evicted. \n\nRegardless - it's a crappy situation since the visiting friend didn't know any better and did politely go outside. If the leaser knew his friend's habits, he should have said something up front about the smoke-free rules when they came over. NTA", "Either OP totally made this up OR his friend was already getting evicted for other reasons and is using OPs incident to extort money.", "Our complex does it. 5 day eviction notice if caught smoking on grounds, outside patio,in apartment. Completely legit.\n\nWe tell all visitors no smoking. 3 people here have been caught and ousted.", "Depends on whether weed is illegal where OP lives. Smoking + illegal activity will get you evicted a lot sooner.\n\nAll else aside though, I think OP is TA for smoking at someone's home without asking. After all, there may be a neighbour with severe asthma or COPD.", "You still don't smoke in someone's home or balcony without asking. They might have a severely asthmatic neighbour, or one who calls the cops for weed, or one of a hundred other things (including being in a smoke-free complex). \n\nIt's mind-boggling to me.", "Either he's lying to OP or OP is lying to us.\n\nNo one's getting evicted in 6 or less days over one instance of smoking. You can't even get an eviction ruling that quickly, even in the most LL-friendly jurisdictions.", "In all honesty, I would not have taken balcony to be \"inside\", assuming balcony is as I imagine it. \n\nI'd have asked anyway, but from my past experience (likely in another country though), balcony has always been fair game.", "I love this idea that somehow smoking in OP\u2019s home isn\u2019t worse as OP smoking outside his friend\u2019s home. In both cases, the friend doesn\u2019t own the home.", "It\u2019s a question because you\u2019re wrong.\n\nThere\u2019s no way his friend got evicted solely because of this one incident \u2014 which was outdoors. His friend can\u2019t be bothered to respect the rules in OP\u2019s place. What makes you think he\u2019d reliably respect the rules in his own? Chances are that he was on his final warning. Otherwise it could\u2019ve been easily diffused by explaining it was a guest who was immediately asked to stop. That doesn\u2019t make it OP\u2019s fault or responsibility.\n\nOP, you\u2019re good. Don\u2019t get harassed into thinking you owe your friend for this just because you own your own place. This sub is *always* willing to spend other people\u2019s money.", "Lol his friend smokes in his house after repeated reminders not to do that and somehow he\u2019s the addict? This place is something else.", "No it doesn\u2019t take multiple complaints. Someone in my building just moved in and got evicted for the first complaint of smoking weed. Lots of buildings will give a warning first but they\u2019re not required to.", "Ya that is not enforceable. And a lawyer would tell you so", "If you\u2019re even considering this, remember that no deep clean is perfect and the back end is what comes off the sale price. These clowns have no idea what they\u2019re talking about.", "I believe that this was the tipping point. OP's friend, for example, has already lit up on the balcony.", "It isn't impossible but it is extremely unlikely that a paying tenant in good standing would be immediately evicted because one guest, one time, smoked outside.", "Are you in the US? If there is a lease, then they can't just evict someone on the assumption they're smoking weed. The renter has rights and can't just be picked out without rightful cause. Of course, ppl don't always know the laws and would leave under the threat of being evicted just so they don't have to deal, but an eviction is a long process that can be legally fought every step of the way.", "And?", "It is absolutely enforceable in many places.  Housing and Urban Development pushed for housing to be smoke free and drug free years ago, and if there is obvious MJ, it is eviction time where I am.", "Let's be honest, people read this subreddit for entertainment, not reality.", "Yes, lol, that's exactly their point. We all know most of it is made up. We choose to interact with a measure of good faith bc it's kinda pointless otherwise. Same reason there's a rule on nosleep about only being allowed to comment \"in character\". It's not fun anymore if half the comments are variations of \"fake and gay'.", "It's the Fox News of subreddits", "Sure, this whole sub *is* pointless. \n\nGood faith is fine when people at least put some effort into their (at best) thought experiments, but when they are as dumb as this one I don\u2019t see a reason to pretend.", "The problem is most/many of the people who watch Fox News think it is reality.", "Nah that's r/conspiracy", "I love the idea that it\u2019s somehow ok to ignore your rules because you own the place. In either case, it\u2019s places your friend doesn\u2019t own.", "Yeah because weed smokers stop noticing it because they're around it so much, like any smell you're around all the time, and they stop realizing just how much weed actually fucking stinks and how badly it sticks to furniture, clothes, your own body and hair, etc. So, yes, of course someone who doesn't smoke very regularly or not at all will be more pissed about people smoking in their house."]}
