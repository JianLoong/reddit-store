How hard is it to ask a question and be polite?", "ESH\n\nI think of you as being the asshole a little less than him though. He repeatedly sparked up after it being made obvious numerous times that you don't want him sparking up in your place. You just assumed whilst already being aware (basing this on the fact you have been on the receiving end of this/lack of this) that, in general to be polite, considerate and respectful, you should first ensure the people who live there/pay the rent/mortage are ok with the actions you intend to take. I feel like your actions were a bit tit-for-tat, slightly spiteful, fighting fire with fire, etc. Your mate just sounded downright selfish in this particular area of life. I think the way you are handling it though kinda makes up for the assholery I view your actions with though. If these were my actions I wouldn't be paying for any deposit. I would probably make things worse by telling this mate that I haven't treated them or their house any different to how they treat me and my gaff and therefore they should just accept the damage these kinds of actions can have.... like getting evicted. It may help him learn how to treat others and their property with more consideration? It was just particularly unlucky that this one occassion was the one to cause a problem. I think maybe I'm being a bit hard on him and you here, maybe I need more background info, like to understand you both as individuals a bit more and how he normally responds to your requests of not sparking up in your gaff, how to speak to him in those moments, the set up of the gathering and how comfortable you were and then your state of mind when deciding whether to ask etc. and maybe my stance on the matter would be slightly different. But as I currently understand it. He had definitely earned the title of asshole first, because his repeated actions seem very inconsiderate of the effects his actions could have on you and your property, but you've rolled up in second place for assholery because of perhaps nothing more than just a silly mistake not to ask, or because you were just starting to dabble in tit-for-tat and fight-fire-with-fire like actions because his inconsiderate actions are becoming irritating and you otherwise don't know how to change his action/view of the matter. I wouldn't dub you forever an asshole, I get it can be difficult not to give in to the urge to fight-fire-with-fire after so many repeated offenses against ya, we are all human. I guess as a positive, you all may learn a little something from the whole thing.... hopefully your judgement on when it's ok to make assumptions will further improve, you already seem to me, based on this one post and how I've interpretted it, to be quite thoughtful with your reasoning for your actions, maybe this situation will help you learn just how much your default morals and the decisions (split-second decision or well planned out) you make for dealing with issues can become inclined to change based on how you feel after certain interactions/occassions. And maybe your mate will develop his understanding a smidgen bit more in how to be considerate towards others, the effects his actions have on other peoples decision making process, to accept the consequences of his acions (including getting treated by others the same way he treats them) and learn what it feels like getting caught by the bad-luck-bunny when playing risky games.", "ESH.

You assumed it was ok, but you failed to ask, or consider that the neighbor situation could be an issue.

A building would never evict someone because of something a guest very briefly does and they stop when asked. They have been looking for something to kick him out for.\n\nSecond, YTA. In an apartment or condo building, the worst place to smoke is often the balcony. It will go right into the windows of all the neighbors very quickly. When you smoke inside it slowly leaks out and is less intrusive. Most buildings force a lot of air into the hallways so that smells from units don't escape into the rest of the building.", "So the addict gets his friend evicted and then had to ask whether he is to blame..\n\nYta", "YTA, for not asking first.

So it is still covered under the definition for tit-for-tat in my books, but definitely not eye-for-eye which is what I would say smoking in his living room would of been. So, with my understanding of my intended meaning behind my words and my limited understanding of what thoughts and emotions were running through OP's mind when deciding where/when to smoke and if/how to ask, I think it's still a possibility it was tit-for-tat. Plus, it sounds like OP didn't know it was even a smoke-free building though at all (maybe it's because I've visited what sounds to me to be similar types of buildings, but I believe the balcony to be part of the building, so my understanding of \"smoke-free building\" would make my first thought \"I'd have to be outside of the premises or in clearly designated smoking areas before I spark up\") but it lends more weight to the notion that actually it was just a silly assumption that back-fired quickly in this unlucky case.", "That\u2019s what I mean.

I've seen it happen 4 separate times in the past two months to neighbors who live here.\n\nEdit: Just in case anyone wants to say \"maybe there was complaints\"\nThe last time it was the woman who lived above me. She literally just moved in and hadn't even lived on the property for more than 48 hours before the cops came and she was evicted for smoking once.", "NTA. \n\n>I just thought he was so used to smoking at his place that is why he always forgot at my house.\n\nHe is used to smoking at his own place, that's why he was on his last strike. If this was a first time occurrence, there's no way he would've been reported that quickly, or thrown out instead of a warning. This is his fuck-up, he's trying to make you take the blame.", "Yes, YTA. You knew your friend was smoking in a smoke-free building and you still chose to light up in his apartment. This put him in a difficult situation and ultimately resulted in his eviction and loss of his security deposit. It was a selfish and inconsiderate decision on your part.\r  \n\r  \nYou should take responsibility for your actions and offer to help your friend out in any way you can. Whether that means contributing to his security deposit for a new place or helping him find a new apartment, it's important to make things right with your friend. You should also apologize to him and your other friends who were affected by your actions. In the future, be more mindful of the rules and regulations in other people's homes.", "Yes YTA - however that doesn\u2019t sound like a legal eviction. Landlords are required to go through court to evict.", "I lived in a smoke free complex, I told guests this so they knew and got high in my room with my window open, couldn't tell which unit the smell came from lol. He constantly broke the rule in your home knowing so but you broke his rule once without knowing so NTA. I'd also say he had previous issues and this was the last straw.", "YTA", "NTA as an avid participant, He should have informed everyone about smokeless building.  Bty I use an indoor filter so residue doesn't build up on my art and furniture.", "NTA. Instead of, or in addition to, helping him with his security deposit, an excellent housewarming gift would be some kind of sign with pictographs indicating no smoking. If you Google  \"No marijuana smoking sign,\" you will see several that have pictures of cigarettes, vapes, marijuana leaves, with the diagonal line through them, which should remind any guests in his home about the rule. Hopefully, he can avoid the situation again. He might need one for the interior of his home plus the balcony.", "NTA It was an innocent mistake on your end plus I live in an apartment complex and in one of the buildings (thank GOD not mine) there's this couple that literally scream fights break up and make up a minium of two times a week.\n\n The door flies open \"\"CLOSE MY DAMN DOOR !\" \"WELL I DONT HAVE TOO !\" \"I DONT WANT THE NEIGHBORS TO SEE YOU ACTING LIKE A JACKA$$ SO CLOSE IT !\" \"MAKE ME !\" \"OH MY GOD FINE !\" then the dude runs out slams the door \"HEY GET BACK HERE A$$HOLE YOU ALMOST HIT ME WITH THE DOOR !\" \"I DONT GOTTA DO $HIT !\" he storms off flipping her the bird then two days later everybody forgets about it.\n\nLike others have said he was probably on his last leg and who knows if your buddy was a good neighbor to the other people living there ? Maybe he got high and blasted his music on a regular basis (that happens here too) and now they had enough and finally had either an eye witness or other evidence that sealed his fate", "YTA. Never light up without permission.", "I would find out if this is actually the cause of the eviction.", "Not only that but he can stay in his apt until the court orders him out. A notice of eviction is just that a notice from the apt. to get out. It is not a legal order  until the judge signs the order. \n\nAs for you paying; since he was so cavalier about smoking in your home he should have given you notice. Also smoking on the balcony isn't smoking in the apt. he should fight it. and he should have notified you about the rule. Its his fault.\n\nNTA", "NTA - I used to work in property management. You absolutely do not get kicked out because of ONE infraction. It can be too easily fought in court. This guy most likely got himself evicted by either not paying rent, OR he has a history of receiving lease violations.", "You are fine, don\u2019t pay anything. He should have said something / shouldn\u2019t have smoked at your place", "YTA", "I\u2019ve been in two apt that are smoking free . The one i am at now is smoke free and they told us smoke outside your building. I\u2019ve seen people in front of there house  or by there cars lighting up or cigs. I would ask him to show you the eviction notice . Cuz maybe he lost his deposit for other reasons or was already on his last strike .", "He knows you don't smoke in the house but lights up every time inside, sounds like he got karma to me.", "It makes zero sense.", "Highly unlikely.  The renter has probably been called out for this many times before.  Most landlords will not evict on a single violation as it\u2019s risky.  This was probably the final straw, and had nothing really to do with op.  I bet the dude smoked inside his apartment regularly and just recently had been told if it happens again he is evicted.  That is not op\u2019s fault.", "In less than a week, too <eye roll>.", "Ask for permission to smoke outside? Seems kinda over the top to me.\n\nAlso I have never heard of smoke-free buildings, is that an American thing?", "You need to recheck your reading comprehension skills before you start replying to people bud, because this is just pathetic.", "Paragraph breaks, my dude.", "If he\u2019s not outright lying, I can almost guarantee that those apartments have been sick of his shit for a while now.", "Most likely the guy got the eviction notice that starts the clock on when the landlord can file in court. I don\u2019t know of any place where a landlord doesn\u2019t have to give you a chance to leave on your own.", "Most public buildings in the US (and many residential) are smoke-free (at least in my experience).  Entire campuses (like my local medical center) are smoke-free.", "Yup, they\u2019re becoming more common here. Within the last 5 years I\u2019ve noticed it go from just lines in leases saying smoking indoors is prohibited, to now every single building I\u2019ve looked into is a \u201cdesignated smoke-free community\u201d and you have to be 25+ feet away from the property line to smoke. \n\nThe last building I lived in had a lot of violations that led to them sending out building-wide emails and putting flyers in the elevators reminding residents of the policy. Definitely nobody was booted out after a single violation or even several, even though they could have been. Most property managers like to avoid hassle. I don\u2019t think OP\u2019s joint was anywhere near the first violation of the friend\u2019s lease.", "Yes. In my entire state you cannot smoke within 100 feet of a public building. One of the things I actually like about the US.", "I think of it like a writing prompt. Some of the stories could be genuine, but some are unbelievable.", "Most give a warning because evicting on a first offense is a dicey proposition if you end up in court.", "Assuming the person is willing to fight the eviction.", "This totally depends on where you live. In some places tenant protections make this true; in others, you can evict someone for almost any reason and do it very quickly. My college boyfriend got evicted; the notice was on his door Monday and by Thursday the movers were throwing his stuff on the street.", "Judge Judy from Reddit \ud83e\udd23", "I'd call it the WWE of subreddits.", "even under the assumption its all fake here its still interesting.\n\nKind of a \"debate this hypothetical moral dilemma\" kind of deal.", "That's true, but landlords are also business people. It makes no sense to evict an agreeable and otherwise good tenant who pays rent on time without a warning at least.", "Agreed!", "Weed being illegal federally makes it quick to evict for corporate landlords.", "How does that change anything??"]}
