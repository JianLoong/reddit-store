How hard is it to ask a question and be polite?", "ESH\n\nI think of you as being the asshole a little less than him though. He repeatedly sparked up after it being made obvious numerous times that you don't want him sparking up in your place. You just assumed whilst already being aware (basing this on the fact you have been on the receiving end of this/lack of this) that, in general to be polite, considerate and respectful, you should first ensure the people who live there/pay the rent/mortage are ok with the actions you intend to take. I feel like your actions were a bit tit-for-tat, slightly spiteful, fighting fire with fire, etc. Your mate just sounded downright selfish in this particular area of life. I think the way you are handling it though kinda makes up for the assholery I view your actions with though. If these were my actions I wouldn't be paying for any deposit. I would probably make things worse by telling this mate that I haven't treated them or their house any different to how they treat me and my gaff and therefore they should just accept the damage these kinds of actions can have.... like getting evicted. It may help him learn how to treat others and their property with more consideration? It was just particularly unlucky that this one occassion was the one to cause a problem. I think maybe I'm being a bit hard on him and you here, maybe I need more background info, like to understand you both as individuals a bit more and how he normally responds to your requests of not sparking up in your gaff, how to speak to him in those moments, the set up of the gathering and how comfortable you were and then your state of mind when deciding whether to ask etc. and maybe my stance on the matter would be slightly different. But as I currently understand it. He had definitely earned the title of asshole first, because his repeated actions seem very inconsiderate of the effects his actions could have on you and your property, but you've rolled up in second place for assholery because of perhaps nothing more than just a silly mistake not to ask, or because you were just starting to dabble in tit-for-tat and fight-fire-with-fire like actions because his inconsiderate actions are becoming irritating and you otherwise don't know how to change his action/view of the matter. I wouldn't dub you forever an asshole, I get it can be difficult not to give in to the urge to fight-fire-with-fire after so many repeated offenses against ya, we are all human. I guess as a positive, you all may learn a little something from the whole thing.... hopefully your judgement on when it's ok to make assumptions will further improve, you already seem to me, based on this one post and how I've interpretted it, to be quite thoughtful with your reasoning for your actions, maybe this situation will help you learn just how much your default morals and the decisions (split-second decision or well planned out) you make for dealing with issues can become inclined to change based on how you feel after certain interactions/occassions. And maybe your mate will develop his understanding a smidgen bit more in how to be considerate towards others, the effects his actions have on other peoples decision making process, to accept the consequences of his acions (including getting treated by others the same way he treats them) and learn what it feels like getting caught by the bad-luck-bunny when playing risky games.", "ESH.

You assumed it was ok, but you failed to ask, or consider that the neighbor situation could be an issue.

A building would never evict someone because of something a guest very briefly does and they stop when asked. They have been looking for something to kick him out for.\n\nSecond, YTA. In an apartment or condo building, the worst place to smoke is often the balcony. It will go right into the windows of all the neighbors very quickly. When you smoke inside it slowly leaks out and is less intrusive. Most buildings force a lot of air into the hallways so that smells from units don't escape into the rest of the building.", "So the addict gets his friend evicted and then had to ask whether he is to blame..\n\nYta", "YTA, for not asking first.

So it is still covered under the definition for tit-for-tat in my books, but definitely not eye-for-eye which is what I would say smoking in his living room would of been. So, with my understanding of my intended meaning behind my words and my limited understanding of what thoughts and emotions were running through OP's mind when deciding where/when to smoke and if/how to ask, I think it's still a possibility it was tit-for-tat. Plus, it sounds like OP didn't know it was even a smoke-free building though at all (maybe it's because I've visited what sounds to me to be similar types of buildings, but I believe the balcony to be part of the building, so my understanding of \"smoke-free building\" would make my first thought \"I'd have to be outside of the premises or in clearly designated smoking areas before I spark up\") but it lends more weight to the notion that actually it was just a silly assumption that back-fired quickly in this unlucky case.", "That\u2019s what I mean.

I've seen it happen 4 separate times in the past two months to neighbors who live here.\n\nEdit: Just in case anyone wants to say \"maybe there was complaints\"\nThe last time it was the woman who lived above me.

This is his fuck-up, he's trying to make you take the blame.", "Yes, YTA. You knew your friend was smoking in a smoke-free building and you still chose to light up in his apartment. This put him in a difficult situation and ultimately resulted in his eviction and loss of his security deposit. It was a selfish and inconsiderate decision on your part.\r  \n\r  \nYou should take responsibility for your actions and offer to help your friend out in any way you can. Whether that means contributing to his security deposit for a new place or helping him find a new apartment, it's important to make things right with your friend. You should also apologize to him and your other friends who were affected by your actions. In the future, be more mindful of the rules and regulations in other people's homes.", "Yes YTA - however that doesn\u2019t sound like a legal eviction. Landlords are required to go through court to evict.", "I lived in a smoke free complex, I told guests this so they knew and got high in my room with my window open, couldn't tell which unit the smell came from lol.

Bty I use an indoor filter so residue doesn't build up on my art and furniture.", "NTA. Instead of, or in addition to, helping him with his security deposit, an excellent housewarming gift would be some kind of sign with pictographs indicating no smoking. If you Google  \"No marijuana smoking sign,\" you will see several that have pictures of cigarettes, vapes, marijuana leaves, with the diagonal line through them, which should remind any guests in his home about the rule. Hopefully, he can avoid the situation again. He might need one for the interior of his home plus the balcony.", "NTA It was an innocent mistake on your end plus I live in an apartment complex and in one of the buildings (thank GOD not mine) there's this couple that literally scream fights break up and make up a minium of two times a week.\n\n The door flies open \"\"CLOSE MY DAMN DOOR !\" \"WELL I DONT HAVE TOO !\" \"I DONT WANT THE NEIGHBORS TO SEE YOU ACTING LIKE A JACKA$$ SO CLOSE IT !\" \"MAKE ME !\" \"OH MY GOD FINE !\" then the dude runs out slams the door \"HEY GET BACK HERE A$$HOLE YOU ALMOST HIT ME WITH THE DOOR !\" \"I DONT GOTTA DO $HIT !\" he storms off flipping her the bird then two days later everybody forgets about it.\n\nLike others have said he was probably on his last leg and who knows if your buddy was a good neighbor to the other people living there ?

Never light up without permission.", "I would find out if this is actually the cause of the eviction.", "Not only that but he can stay in his apt until the court orders him out. A notice of eviction is just that a notice from the apt. to get out. It is not a legal order  until the judge signs the order. \n\nAs for you paying; since he was so cavalier about smoking in your home he should have given you notice.

The renter has probably been called out for this many times before.  Most landlords will not evict on a single violation as it\u2019s risky.

Definitely nobody was booted out after a single violation or even several, even though they could have been. Most property managers like to avoid hassle. I don\u2019t think OP\u2019s joint was anywhere near the first violation of the friend\u2019s lease.", "Yes. In my entire state you cannot smoke within 100 feet of a public building.

You can't take away a security deposit when there is no damage to the rented property.  You could fight that in court.  Your friend isn't telling you the whole story.\n\nAt my place the whole complex is smoke free.  In the common area by the pool some guests were smoking.  When the building manager told them to stop smoking, they were extremely rude to the staff.  They sent notices to everyone in the complex.  The next weekend the same thing happened but this time the guests were violent and the police were called.

You should always ask before you smoke anything on someone else's property. Never assume it's ok to smoke even on a balcony. It's often not.   \n\n\nYour friend is lying to you - no one in the history of evictions was evicted for a one time offence, like smoking once on a balcony in a smoke free building.

They are not the same. \n\nSome residential buildings may have rules, but they don't hold the same power as laws.

They rarely even care. When it comes to leasing apartments, the feds aren't going to give two shits. My apartment complex is actually more likely to kick you from smoking cigarettes than cannabis because the former is much more destructive to property. Now if someone goes to court for an eviction, then the judge might care but, again, the landlord would need proof and not just complaints. The judge isn't going to be like \"oh, you were reported by a neighbor to be smoking pot, GO STRAIGHT TO JAIL.\" There needs to evidence, police reports, legal findings. As terrible as the legal system, and cops are, there are still some basic rules that have to be followed. Of course, if the person being accused as a record or is a POC then the judge is more likely to not adhere to the rules as much but that's a whole nother situation all together. \n\nOf course dealers would be shut down, just like people can't produce/sell liquor or tobacco that hasn't been government sanctioned. However, being accused of drinking moonshine or buying cigarettes on the black market isn't going to get someone boots from their apartment by the landlord. The cops /may/ care, but only if they think it'll lead them to the seller. This is basic workflow info for these institutions.\n\nI don't know where you keep getting this \"stall emall of marijuana\" at. It is like some sort of weird pearl-clutching statement for people who believe in \"reefer madness\" or something. If we were talking about cigarettes, sure, the smell infiltrates everything and the nicotine tar stains the walls and furniture. Cannabis smoke isn't like that, and the level of smoking that would have to happen on a near constant basis to even get close to what you're describing is implausible. Not to mention the different ways of intaking cannabis means people are less likely to combust and use edibles or vaping. Neither of which smell. Sure, cannabis smoke may bother people. Just like fish smells bother people, or boiled eggs, or strong spicy curries or fermented foods. It isn't something that immediately means someone gets kicked out of their home."]}
