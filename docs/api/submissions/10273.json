Because of this, and because you all smoke weed, he should have made it clear to anyone coming to his place what the rules were, if there were going to be such dire consequences. \n\nYou might want to help out with the deposit as technically you did get him evicted, but you should also gently point out why you assumed what you did, because he always smokes indoors at yours.", "I'm gonna go with ESH, but the one violation and evicted seems fishy to me. \n\nHe's the arsch because he randomly lights up at ur place. I smoke a ton too, but tobacco isn't allowed in my house, except my bathroom in basement (fan).

How hard is it to ask a question and be polite?", "ESH\n\nI think of you as being the asshole a little less than him though. He repeatedly sparked up after it being made obvious numerous times that you don't want him sparking up in your place. You just assumed whilst already being aware (basing this on the fact you have been on the receiving end of this/lack of this) that, in general to be polite, considerate and respectful, you should first ensure the people who live there/pay the rent/mortage are ok with the actions you intend to take. I feel like your actions were a bit tit-for-tat, slightly spiteful, fighting fire with fire, etc. Your mate just sounded downright selfish in this particular area of life. I think the way you are handling it though kinda makes up for the assholery I view your actions with though. If these were my actions I wouldn't be paying for any deposit. I would probably make things worse by telling this mate that I haven't treated them or their house any different to how they treat me and my gaff and therefore they should just accept the damage these kinds of actions can have.... like getting evicted. It may help him learn how to treat others and their property with more consideration? It was just particularly unlucky that this one occassion was the one to cause a problem. I think maybe I'm being a bit hard on him and you here, maybe I need more background info, like to understand you both as individuals a bit more and how he normally responds to your requests of not sparking up in your gaff, how to speak to him in those moments, the set up of the gathering and how comfortable you were and then your state of mind when deciding whether to ask etc. and maybe my stance on the matter would be slightly different. But as I currently understand it. He had definitely earned the title of asshole first, because his repeated actions seem very inconsiderate of the effects his actions could have on you and your property, but you've rolled up in second place for assholery because of perhaps nothing more than just a silly mistake not to ask, or because you were just starting to dabble in tit-for-tat and fight-fire-with-fire like actions because his inconsiderate actions are becoming irritating and you otherwise don't know how to change his action/view of the matter. I wouldn't dub you forever an asshole, I get it can be difficult not to give in to the urge to fight-fire-with-fire after so many repeated offenses against ya, we are all human. I guess as a positive, you all may learn a little something from the whole thing.... hopefully your judgement on when it's ok to make assumptions will further improve, you already seem to me, based on this one post and how I've interpretted it, to be quite thoughtful with your reasoning for your actions, maybe this situation will help you learn just how much your default morals and the decisions (split-second decision or well planned out) you make for dealing with issues can become inclined to change based on how you feel after certain interactions/occassions. And maybe your mate will develop his understanding a smidgen bit more in how to be considerate towards others, the effects his actions have on other peoples decision making process, to accept the consequences of his acions (including getting treated by others the same way he treats them) and learn what it feels like getting caught by the bad-luck-bunny when playing risky games.", "ESH. YTA for assuming its ok to light up at his place and he's one for not listening to you. Seems like a toxic friendship tbh", "Esh.\n\nHim for repeatedly smoking indoors at your place despite you telling him not to, and even more so you for lighting up at somebody else's *rented* home without asking. \n\nYou never know what conditions are on somebody's lease, and smoke free isn't uncommon. \n\nYou owe him big time.

You did that shit out of spite, and it caused some seriously bad repercussions for your friend. You don\u2019t owe him anything as far as a security deposit or money otherwise, but I guess you have to decide if that\u2019s something you want to do or not.", "ESH.

Hey Bro, is it ok if i lit up there?", "YTA - but you can mitigate that by taking responsibility and giving your friend a free of charge place to stay in the home that you own until he's found a new place.\n\nThey both sound like people I'm glad not to know :/", "YTA\n\nThe title tells me everything I need to know.  You even **know** you are the AH here.\n\nYou **absolutely** owe him money **at least** for a security deposit.

You owe him the security deposit, at the very least.\n\nthat being said, I doubt that this was all your doing. eviction for smoking once is really extreme, and would not at all hold up here (not sure about there) so i bet you your friend has been caught smoking before. especially seeing as he smokes in your house. id have a talk with him, and maybe agree that youll pay the deposit if he starts going outside to smoke at your house?", "YTA on this one. You assumed it was ok, but you failed to ask, or consider that the neighbor situation could be an issue. That suggests a lack of thought on your part.\n\nThe 'but he did it to me' defence doesn't really apply here, in part because for him to be reported means your actions weren't unnoticed, so you bothered third parties.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A building would never evict someone because of something a guest very briefly does and they stop when asked. They have been looking for something to kick him out for.\n\nSecond, YTA. In an apartment or condo building, the worst place to smoke is often the balcony. It will go right into the windows of all the neighbors very quickly. When you smoke inside it slowly leaks out and is less intrusive. Most buildings force a lot of air into the hallways so that smells from units don't escape into the rest of the building.", "So the addict gets his friend evicted and then had to ask whether he is to blame..\n\nYta", "YTA, for not asking first. Though I doubt he would be evicted over one incident. Is weed legal where you are?", "Yta. Give him back his security department. And always ask before you light up.", "Yeah, that doesn't happen. Either this is made up or it was a final straw situation. I suspect friend has been lighting up inside and been warned multiple times.", "Yeah I'm thinking here that since OP's friend always lights up at their house, they have been warned many times by their own landlord.", "I also thought this was bizarre\u2026the only thing I could think of was that the apartment was a duplex and the landlord owns the property and literally lives right above or below them\u2026or it\u2019s made up", "I feel like this was the final straw. Like OP\u2019s friend has already smoked out on the balcony.", "This is what I was thinking. OPs friend was already on his way out.", "Some places are like that.  I live in California, and one apartment I rented had a section in their lease agreement that basically said, \"We don't care if you use weed for medical purposes, the Department of Housing recognizes it as federally illegal, and if we catch you in possession of it we have the right to terminate your lease.\"  That said I'm not sure how often those policies get enforced, I'd usually expect there to be an initial warning or fine", "That was my first reaction also.  Then I read that breaking a lease due to smoking can be a 3-day eviction process on the first offense.\n\nStill seems fishy, and a difficult one for the landlord to prove a tenants responsibility for.", "I was going to say the same thing.

And in my experiences, many people will cross boundaries in any capacity or get close to crossing a boundary without actually crossing it out of being passive aggressive, \"I'm going to do this, because they did that\", which I think can potentially be spiteful too at times. So it is still covered under the definition for tit-for-tat in my books, but definitely not eye-for-eye which is what I would say smoking in his living room would of been. So, with my understanding of my intended meaning behind my words and my limited understanding of what thoughts and emotions were running through OP's mind when deciding where/when to smoke and if/how to ask, I think it's still a possibility it was tit-for-tat. Plus, it sounds like OP didn't know it was even a smoke-free building though at all (maybe it's because I've visited what sounds to me to be similar types of buildings, but I believe the balcony to be part of the building, so my understanding of \"smoke-free building\" would make my first thought \"I'd have to be outside of the premises or in clearly designated smoking areas before I spark up\") but it lends more weight to the notion that actually it was just a silly assumption that back-fired quickly in this unlucky case.", "That\u2019s what I mean.
