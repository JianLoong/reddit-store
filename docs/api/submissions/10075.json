Train. Carpool. Tram. I don't know where you live, but there has to be something. \n\nEven if that means hopping on a bus to catch a tram to catch a train then another bus to get to a spot that is local for you. If you were offering me $500 worth of clothes (I'm estimating, and that's probably a low number, considering that it's for up to 18 months) for my kid I would definitely figure out how to get to you and how to get the clothes back to my place. \n\nYou're doing enough.

I had a bunch and offered them for free. We agreed to meet up. Then when the time came she was magically busy and asked me to drop them.at her door. I don't want strangers at my home for this kind of stuff otherwise I would have just told her to come get it. I was nice enough to drop it off, but only because it was like 8 minutes away and I had two bags of it and I wanted it to go to a mama in need versus goodwill. But I was upset that instead of meeting me when I am doing a huge favor she wanted me to go to her home. Not cool. Even though it was like 6 minutes from where we were going to meet\n\nBut this lady is totally out of line! 50 minutes away she should have come to get it! If she literally has no transportation, too bad. She needs to find someone closer. And to TELL you to PAY for an Uber is frickin insane! 2 hours worth of an Uber or taxi would be expensive! Please offer it on a local Facebook page. There are mom's out there who could use this and would be willing to go to your home or meet up! Usually these things have like half a dozen women going \"Next!\" On the post. A local woman who claims to be homeless with her kids asked for free clothes for them. She literally said she would walk to wherever the person wanted to meet as long as it was within a few miles of downtown.", "Definitely not the AH. Sounds like a set up of some sort. Why couldn\u2019t she Uber to you? Nobody works 24/7, so she couldn\u2019t arrange a time for her boyfriend to drive themselves over? It all seems highly suspicious and I wouldn\u2019t lose any sleep over it. Plenty of other people out there who need help that are probably much closer to you. Make sure you never put yourself in a dangerous situation. Always have someone go with you and I recommend meeting in public places.", "This. And, also, I've heard enough horror stories that I'd NEVER recommend a pregnant woman go to some shady person's house. This \"pregnant woman\" keeps insisting that OP or her husband come.

I just feel bad, she has money struggles and will (I\u2019m not sure now after reading all the comments) have a baby. My parents have been in that position after war started in their country and they lost everything (jobs, car, house, etc) with 3 kids. Good people helped them and they got their chance to bounce back. I believe in good deeds and helping those who need it, since it can really change someone\u2019s live.\n\nI\u2019m not sure about cost of all of the clothes, since there is an excessive amount of them and many haven\u2019t even been worn (my in-laws were too happy to have their first grandchild), but I guess it\u2019s twice or three times more expensive than that, since some of the clothes are from expensive brands. \n\nI appreciate this point of view, and agree that this is big help for anyone (baby clothes and shoes are expensive nowadays), and if someone really needed, they will find a way, especially if there is a boyfriend with a car who car drive. It opened my eyes a bit. \n\nWe\u2019ve decided to drop everything off at women\u2019s shelter nearby on Saturday!

OP, don\u2019t do it! Anyone reading the thread, be very cautious if you or any pregnant woman you know is offering or picking up free baby items from a stranger. This is a common ruse for murder/baby stealing. Even if murder and baby stealing itself isn\u2019t common, the ruse for doing so is. \n  \n  \nLook up: \n  \n  \nTaylor Parker (she was recently sentenced to death). \n  \nLisa Montgomery (also death penalty which already took place). \n  \n  \n  \n\nAmber Waterman. She pled not guilty and her trial is coming up soon. And her husband was in on it too. \n\nRosa Vazquez from Mexico was going to meet a woman offering free baby clothes, she was killed and baby was stolen.     \n  \n\nMarlen Ochoa-Lopez was also killed after going to pick up free baby items. \n\n  \n \n  \n  \nAll of these are recent cases except for Montgomery, which happened in 2004, but she was executed in 2021.  \n  \n  \n  \nDefinitely NTA.

OP and her husband could be getting rid of baby clothes because they're not having any more babies, for all the ad responder knows.  If anything, the responder is in the position to be suspicious, because she's looking for baby clothes and thus likely pregnant.", "Jesus fucking Christ", "There's even been at least one incident where the woman's friend was the one that attacked her.", "Yep.
