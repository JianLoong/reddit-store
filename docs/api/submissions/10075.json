It happened that she lives ~50min away in different state, and told me that she can\u2019t come and I\u2019ll need to drop everything off.

He told me that the area is not the safe one, and he is totally against me and our daughter to drive there alone, nor he is willing to drive 2hours to drop off something that they should be willing to take, since it\u2019s free.

Why can\u2019t she take an Uber there?", "NTA. What on earth is she doing on your neighborhood page if she\u2019s 50 minutes away? I wonder if she scours groups for freebies. I would block her and move on. Asking you to take an Uber? To deliver? What nerve.", "NTA.  Probably not even pregnant and wants to resell. And that\u2019s why she wants a drop off.", "NTA.  She was super entitled.  Getting free stuff and complaining about having to lift a finger instead of it being served up on a platter for her.  Pregnant are not, this is entitled behavior.", "NTA- um she shouldnt even be on your nextdoor if she is that far away from you. \n\nI'd find a womens shelter and donate to them instead. Sorry, seen way too many scammers on that app to trust if she really did need to clothes.. most are resale types getting free stuff.", "NTA she sounds like a choosing begger.", "NTA- I\u2019m part of plenty Freecycle groups and this is not okay\u2026 find it hard to believe she didn\u2019t have anyone that could pick it up or meet you halfway over the next couple of days.

Especially if it\u2019s putting you out an excessive amount.", "NTA, just a classic case of a choosy-begger.", "NTA, situations like this is why I don\u2019t post on sites like that to donate anymore. You have no idea what her actual back story is. (She might be taking things for free and then selling them) Donate to a reputable organization.", "NTA it was generous of you to give everything away, but in exchange for that she needs to be the one to come collect it. Insisting that you deliver it, something you were giving for free? Absolutely not. And then expecting you to take an Uber? No.  \n\nBest to find someone else to donate it to, or give it to a local shelter or something like that.", "NTA.  This is getting to be r/choosybegger status", "NTA. Giving something away for free then having to drive nearly 2 hours at your time and cost no way! And why is she suggesting you get an Uber again at your cost she can get an Uber and pay it.

Hey lady, do you KNOW about the subreddit Choosing Beggars?! Lol", "NTA beggars can\u2019t be choosers.

Also Next Door does not mean 50 minutes away.", "NTA. You don't owe it to her, and her entitled tantrum shouldn't be rewarded.\n\nCongrats on your little guy!", "NTA\n\nYou were willing to give all your stuff to her for free. These things are probably very expensive and she should have been the one making the arrangements to come get the items. She tried to abuse your generosity and got upset when it blew in her face. Block her and donate the baby items to charity", "I quit using the nextdoor app because it has just turned into a site for beggars, always the same ones. If someone isn\u2019t grateful and can\u2019t make arrangements to pick up free items IMO you should just cease communication. NTA", "NTA\nYou offered her free stuff. Your only requirement was that she come get it.", "NTA\n\nIf something is being offered free then it is very entitled to ask for delivery especially once you factor in requesting someone to also take the time and money for a 2hr Uber. You tried to do something kind and she is acting quite rude. \n\nTo be honest there\u2019s also a chance that she is just looking for items to resell- \u201cwilling to take everything\u201d Is a bit of a red flag.", "NTA-she sounds very greedy and unappreciative. Block her.", "NTA and this sounds very suspicious. Please stop all contact with her and block her. Something doesn\u2019t add up here.", "Nta. She sounds entitled. Just take the clothes to a woman's shelter and block her.", "NTA - You\u2019re giving away something for free and this woman wants you to hand deliver it to her? And she lives an hour away?  That\u2019s ridiculous.", "NTA. Free. Pick up. No delivery...come on. That is clear. Talk about choosy beggars!", "NTA, I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t. there was a story like this where a woman ended up getting stabbed and the lady giving free stuff (flipped) cut the baby out of her and it died I believe", "NTA and this is a case of r/beggingchoosers", "Nta she shouldn't guilt people trying to help. It's not your fault she can't pick the stuff up. She asked if it was possible and it's not so tough luck! That should of been the end of it!", "There are plenty of people in need who would appreciate it, without an unbelievable sense of entitlement that you should cater to them.  I say you dodged a bullet, because you can bet that sense of entitlement and trying to guilt you would not stop at 1-time delivery of clothes. Block her and don\u2019t look back.  Find a domestic abuse shelter or other charitable organization.", "Choosing beggars. She can get an Uber, or ask a friend, or get a bus, etc etc.\n\nNTA.\n\n[edited for spelling]", "NTA. She\u2019s a choosing beggar. Don\u2019t fall for her antics.", "NTA. At best she is trying to take advantage of your kindness by trying to make you feel bad. At worst, she\u2019s prepping to rob you. You offered things for free, those who want them and have the means can come get them. It\u2019s off the table otherwise. \n\nYou seem like a nice person. Be careful, you\u2019re so kind it could put you in a very bad spot one day. Being kind is a GOOD trait, and I don\u2019t want you to lose that. But being a martyr will ruin your life in the long run.\n\nYou need to have boundaries, *especially* with kindness. Others problems are not ultimately yours to fix, and there are people who are NOT as kind as you who will do their very best to take advantage of everyone else\u2019s good intentions if they will oblige them. \n\nPersonally, I think becoming a parent is a very very good time to learn what those lines and boundaries look like. Listen to your husband here, he\u2019s got your boundaries in the right places.", "She doesn\u2019t have extra money as far as I understood. I mean, we\u2019re not rich too, but can afford it", "I get sometimes posts from people that live an hour away. I\u2019m not sure how it works", "That was my guess.", "I didn\u2019t even know it\u2019s a thing. This world keeps surprising me!", "Honestly, block her. Stop conversing. She\u2019s pulling your heart strings because she knows you care.", "So? She's asking way too much. NTA.", "And? If she wants the free stuff she has to come and get it", "She can look for free things on her local area. And I\u2019m sure that someone else near you has need of these things. My local freecycle groups often have baby clothes and they get snapped up so fast! Maybe try that if Nextdoor doesn\u2019t work for you (and maybe you\u2019ll get some awesome boy clothes in exchange!)", "I've used nextdoor. Go into your account and it should have a list of neighborhoods you get info from. You can adjust it from there to having neighborhoods within a few miles. That should help you out.\n\nAnother tip. If you decide to post the clothes again, put in there they are responsible for pick up at a public place(not all but some police stations are putting up specific zones near them for safer exchanges), no exceptions. It should help get rid of some of the people that pull scams.", "NTA. If it makes you feel better, she isn't pregnant. She is scamming you. There is a reason she is so unwilling to come to you.", "There's a sub called r/ChoosingBeggars where this type of person is a stereotype. You should just block this person instantly and entirely.", "NTA.  I give things away free all the time.  But people have to come pick the items up.  I wouldn\u2019t do anymore than that.  And neither should you.", "NTA. She\u2019s an entitled AH, if she wants the clothes for FREE then she can get the Uber. Her financial status is not your concern period.", "NTA. Don't feel bad for not delivering free stuff an hour away. Her request breaks the agreed upon rules of the free stuff world. You can't greatly inconvenience the giver, and in your situation it simply isn't possible for you to deliver it. Offering it is kind. You've done nothing wrong.", "NTA  \nNo way, free, multiple sizes, and all someone has to do it pick it up. Nope, they come and get it. Only way I deliver on that is if it is 15 minutes away and they offer me $10.", "NTA... free items should be picked up with gratitude.  I would text her back that you found some one that needed them in your neighborhood.  The cloths were gratefully received and are rehomed.\nThen drop them off at the thrift.", "NTA she belongs on choosing beggars.", "I was thinking she was going to steal OP\u2019s baby", "What", "NTA find a local shelter or an organisation that helps women / people flee from bad situations and start again with their children and pets where possible. I promise the items will be truly appreciated and will likely be passed on within that community spurred by need and true  appreciation. \n Best wishes with the pregnancy", "There are multiple true crime stories of  pregnant women being lured to places then attacked and having their babies cut out of them, usually by a deranged  woman who wants a baby."]}
