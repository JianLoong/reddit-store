Also Next Door does not mean 50 minutes away.", "NTA. You don't owe it to her, and her entitled tantrum shouldn't be rewarded.\n\nCongrats on your little guy!", "NTA\n\nYou were willing to give all your stuff to her for free.

Your only requirement was that she come get it.", "NTA\n\nIf something is being offered free then it is very entitled to ask for delivery especially once you factor in requesting someone to also take the time and money for a 2hr Uber.

At worst, she\u2019s prepping to rob you. You offered things for free, those who want them and have the means can come get them. It\u2019s off the table otherwise. \n\nYou seem like a nice person. Be careful, you\u2019re so kind it could put you in a very bad spot one day. Being kind is a GOOD trait, and I don\u2019t want you to lose that. But being a martyr will ruin your life in the long run.\n\nYou need to have boundaries, *especially* with kindness. Others problems are not ultimately yours to fix, and there are people who are NOT as kind as you who will do their very best to take advantage of everyone else\u2019s good intentions if they will oblige them. \n\nPersonally, I think becoming a parent is a very very good time to learn what those lines and boundaries look like.

If she wants the free stuff she has to come and get it", "She can look for free things on her local area. And I\u2019m sure that someone else near you has need of these things.

Go into your account and it should have a list of neighborhoods you get info from. You can adjust it from there to having neighborhoods within a few miles. That should help you out.\n\nAnother tip. If you decide to post the clothes again, put in there they are responsible for pick up at a public place(not all but some police stations are putting up specific zones near them for safer exchanges), no exceptions.

Don't feel bad for not delivering free stuff an hour away. Her request breaks the agreed upon rules of the free stuff world.

You've done nothing wrong.", "NTA  \nNo way, free, multiple sizes, and all someone has to do it pick it up. Nope, they come and get it. Only way I deliver on that is if it is 15 minutes away and they offer me $10.", "NTA... free items should be picked up with gratitude.

I promise the items will be truly appreciated and will likely be passed on within that community spurred by need and true  appreciation. \n Best wishes with the pregnancy", "There are multiple true crime stories of  pregnant women being lured to places then attacked and having their babies cut out of them, usually by a deranged  woman who wants a baby.", "r/choosingbeggars", "NTA\n\n1. You don't actually know if she's pregnant or poor. You don't know if this person wants to sell the clothing for a profit, harm you, or really wants to use the clothes.\n2. No one in your family needs to drive 2 hours, to a risky area to be generous with those clothes. You will still be generous with them and will still be benefitting one or more people when you donate it somewhere.\n3. Why is this person looking for stuff that's 50 miles away if she can NEVER travel to pick something up? This person's bf is not working ALL the time. They could plan one day for her to drop bf off so that she can drive to get something she wants. Surely, there is at least one friend. This is a person who doesn't want a solution; she wants you to come to her.\n4. BTW, nice of you to be generous about the clothing. Food for thought.

You may also have a kids' used clothing store in your area that would love to pay you something for those clothes.

If someone is buying an item then travel could go either way, but when it\u2019s a free item it\u2019s up to the person receiving it to come pick it up. That\u2019s common sense.", "NTA. I've been on both sides of this. She should have either backed off when you said no, or looked for another way to get them. Where I live, it's common for people to drive a decent distance for work, and it's not hard to arrange another kind hearted person to pick something up at one end of their commute and drop it off at the other end.\n\nShe's being incredibly entitled, and you need to block her and move on with your life.
