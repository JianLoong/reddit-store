My family has a history of suppressing our feelings and bottling emotions up. Because of this, our relationship was fine on the surface, but many of our issues were behind closed doors. Long story short, my ex was very controlling and wanted to run my life. When I did anything he didn\u2019t plan or agree with, it would lead to explosive outbursts of hate and venom thrown my way. Ultimately we ended things (not on considerably good terms) My family knows that we had broken up, but I was never able to explain what the real reason behind it was. It is also important to mention that both his parents and his older sister loved me and were completely oblivious to his actions. \n\nWell, two weeks ago I found out that my ex had been in a accident while he was out cycling. He was riding on a back country road when a distracted driver struck him after blowing a stop sign. He was rushed to the hospital, but the impact ruptured one of his lungs and cause internal hemorrhage. He passed that afternoon. \n\nI found out when his mother had contacted me via facebook and was giving me the details to when they were planning his showing. In a moment of pure shock, I told her that I was not going to attend. She asked me why and I wasn\u2019t able to give her an answer that wouldn\u2019t express how much pain and psychological anguish her son had caused me. She was confused, but not necessarily upset. \n\nHowever, she had communicated to my parents and they were astonished that I was not planning to attend. They called me cold and heartless. They said I should put everything aside and be there to support his family. Again, I didn\u2019t know what to say, so I simply told them I wasn\u2019t going and to please not ask me again. \n\nHis funeral is this weekend, and I am still not planning on going. My parents haven\u2019t really forgiven me and conversation around our house has been short. The thought of going and seeing him fills me with so much dread and panic.\n\nReddit, I need to know.

Put all of your history aside and even if there was never a cross word between you, you would not be obligated to attend. It's a purely personal choice and there is no \"wrong\" answer. If you don't feel comfortable, don't go.", "NTA\n\nYou have a right to respond however you wish and people that are not as close to the departed have place to pass judgement. Even if he wasn\u2019t abusive, you deciding not to go is your decision.\n\nAs someone who had an abusive ex, I can say going would be traumatic. Everyone feels the need to speak well of the dead and that will just hurt more. \n\nIf your parents don\u2019t know what happened and if you feel comfortable telling them, I would. Be careful if they know his parents. You don\u2019t want this getting back to them and really it would do no good. He\u2019s gone and telling them now would be pointless. \n\nYou can support the parents without attending, such as making them food and delivering it. If they were nice and kind to you, this is a possibility. I would also talk to a therapist cause this is a huge event and I am sure there are a lot of emotions you\u2019re having.\n\nAlways make sure to make space for yourself and do what you need to for your own safety.", "NTA. Do not sacrifice yourself to bring others comfort, you don\u2019t owe his family anything. \n\nYou should spend that day doing something that brings you peace and joy.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not obliged to do anything. You saying you\u2019re not going is enough. You owe no one an explanation.\n\nIf you WANT to share why, especially to your family, then do it. They\u2019ll likely understand your choice better and ~maybe~ even provide support for you.\n\nIf you like his family you could just send flowers or a note.\n\nI personally would not tell his family why, but that\u2019s just me.", "I think it's pretty black and white when it comes to the abuse aspect.  NTA in that regard.  I think it's going to be difficult for his family to understand, considering that they didn't know.  However, he is also your ex.  You weren't still together at the time of his passing.  How long had you been broken up?", "NAH  \nYou should probably tell your parents what happened, and how impossible it would be for you to put it aside for the funeral. At least then they won't think the worst of you, which, given the circumstances, is pretty understandable if they think you just broke up without issue. You don't have to explain it all to them, but you could at least say there was more to the break-up than they know, and you're not comfortable explaining more, nor going to the funeral. Hopefully, they would take the hint.", "NTA. Your parents are very much being assholes about this. I wouldn't be looking for them to forgive you. They should be looking for you to forgive them.", "NTA. \n\nBut I would talk to your parents. If you can't explain then at least say that you have your reasons and don't/can't talk about it now. \n\nI'd also reach out privately or go see his family and express your condolences for the loss of their son. You don't have to give them a reason why you can't go to the funeral but I do think that if you can, it'd go a long way to see the family. Even if it's not at their house.\n\nAs you mentioned , his parents and sister think fondly of you. Even if they don't know how shitty he was, they just suddenly and tragically lost a family member.", "NTA.\nI can understand why his parents or your parents is upset about your reaction if they didn't know how he treated you while you guys were together. Truth be told your ex is now gone he is not going to know or care who came to say goodbye.", "NAH. Sorry.\n\nYour parents only know that you offended a family that thought very highly of you and got along well with you, and declined to attend.\n\nHowever, without knowing whether you did so or not, I believe you should not have waited to send your condolences to the survivors in some physical form, so that the family can have the option to hide it during the service (if it's too embarrassing you are not present) and so that they know you care about them.", "NTA\n\n\u2026buuuuut Funerals are for the living not the dead. \nWhat is your relationship with his parents?  Do you like them? \nThey probably thought you were going to push some grand kids out for them. \nAre/were your parents and his parents friends?\nAre your parents attending?\nHow long were you broken up?  \nYour ex probably didn\u2019t tell his parents that you left because he was asshole. \n\nYou are under no obligation to go but it\u2019s about your relationship to his family and not to him. \n\nSend a card. Again not an obligation but it will likely save you some hassle. \nThink of it as an investment in your future happiness.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Considering your emotional wounds from the relationship, wounds that have clearly not healed yet, you are quite justified in not attending the funeral.  Going will only cause you anguish.

Even if they broke up amicably, she would not be obligated to go to the funeral of an ex partner. Her family calling her \"cold and heartless\" is completely unreasonable and unacceptable.\n\nI do agree, however, that she should either tell them what you suggested or tell them outright why they broke up. They are not owed details, especially given how they're treating her right now, but they do need to be told that she has valid reasons and that they need to back off.", "Her parents don't know the reason for the break up.", "Funerals are for the living BUT about the dead.

Funerals exist to give people a chance to process their grief, but they don't help everyone, if a funeral is going to make things worse for you then you are not obliged to go, if you're an ex i don't even feel there's a social obligation to go.\n\nYour parents have no idea what's going through your head, but they should respect that this news is going to bring on a lot of emotions & should be considerate of you not hound you over it. You've got a tough couple of weeks ahead of you so take care of yourself", "NTA.

They should accept that their daughter has no interest in attending the funeral of her EX partner without resorting to name-calling.
