My family has a history of suppressing our feelings and bottling emotions up. Because of this, our relationship was fine on the surface, but many of our issues were behind closed doors. Long story short, my ex was very controlling and wanted to run my life. When I did anything he didn\u2019t plan or agree with, it would lead to explosive outbursts of hate and venom thrown my way. Ultimately we ended things (not on considerably good terms) My family knows that we had broken up, but I was never able to explain what the real reason behind it was. It is also important to mention that both his parents and his older sister loved me and were completely oblivious to his actions. \n\nWell, two weeks ago I found out that my ex had been in a accident while he was out cycling. He was riding on a back country road when a distracted driver struck him after blowing a stop sign. He was rushed to the hospital, but the impact ruptured one of his lungs and cause internal hemorrhage. He passed that afternoon. \n\nI found out when his mother had contacted me via facebook and was giving me the details to when they were planning his showing. In a moment of pure shock, I told her that I was not going to attend. She asked me why and I wasn\u2019t able to give her an answer that wouldn\u2019t express how much pain and psychological anguish her son had caused me. She was confused, but not necessarily upset. \n\nHowever, she had communicated to my parents and they were astonished that I was not planning to attend. They called me cold and heartless. They said I should put everything aside and be there to support his family. Again, I didn\u2019t know what to say, so I simply told them I wasn\u2019t going and to please not ask me again. \n\nHis funeral is this weekend, and I am still not planning on going. My parents haven\u2019t really forgiven me and conversation around our house has been short. The thought of going and seeing him fills me with so much dread and panic.\n\nReddit, I need to know.

Even if he wasn\u2019t abusive, you deciding not to go is your decision.\n\nAs someone who had an abusive ex, I can say going would be traumatic. Everyone feels the need to speak well of the dead and that will just hurt more. \n\nIf your parents don\u2019t know what happened and if you feel comfortable telling them, I would. Be careful if they know his parents. You don\u2019t want this getting back to them and really it would do no good.

If you can't explain then at least say that you have your reasons and don't/can't talk about it now. \n\nI'd also reach out privately or go see his family and express your condolences for the loss of their son. You don't have to give them a reason why you can't go to the funeral but I do think that if you can, it'd go a long way to see the family. Even if it's not at their house.\n\nAs you mentioned , his parents and sister think fondly of you.

You're obviously N T A for not wanting to go for obvious reasons.  However, since most of the bad stuff happened behind closed doors, and you had close relationships with each others families, it would on the surface appear cold and heartless that you wouldn't go to a neutral observer.

If they do, though, be prepared for them to talk about it when they return. Remind them (repeatedly if necessary) that the old wounds hurt you and even talking about it with them could reopen them.\n\nBut if you haven't already, you probably should consider talking about it with a close friend, another family member with whom you're close, or a professional (a therapist, a priest if you're religious, etc.) since it sounds like you may still have some pain from those old wounds.", "Agree. How is it expected to go to an ex's funeral, unless you are still friends or have kids together? I think it's weird of the family to even ask, let alone guilt trip her.", "I agree life might be better for OP if she explains to her parents (her ex's parents don't deserve it and might even actually know the reason why), but she doesn't deserve anyone an explanation as well.", "or her parents can be adults and respect their kids wishes?", "Not telling them doesnt make them they asshole tho.
