And has baby brain. \n\nOn days that you work I imagine she is the one that is basically the sole parent, and probably on days that you don't work she does the lions share.", "YTA. So your wife is overwhelmed and exhausted with a one year old and you say it would all be okay if she just picked up after herself. Are you kidding me?", "You\u2019re not the asshole for \u201coffering to help with the dishes\u201d but YTA for telling her that \u201c90% of the problems with messiness could be solved if she picked up after herself\u201d. Like what were you thinking?\n\nETA: Your title was misleading. Either you did that on purpose in a weak attempt to garner sympathy, or you are actually that dense. I suspect it\u2019s the former.", "YTA. Your wife works almost full time and does all the childcare during her non-working hours multiple times a week, and your response to her feeling overwhelmed is to lecture her about tidying up as she goes?", "YTA\n\nYour wife is struggling. Just pick up some of the slack while she gets her feet under her. \n\nThis is an incredibly assholish thing to say:\n\n>I told her 90% of the problems with messiness could be solved if she picked up after herself.\n\nIt's kind of staggering. I wouldn't want to talk to you for a while either. \n\nSometimes when you have a kid both parents have to do more than they want to do. You saying \"I can't work less\" is not the issue. She's not asking you to work less. She's asking you to listen and pick up a little more work around the house for a short time until things settle.", "YTA\n\nYou completely invalidated her feelings by not even offering a \"yeah, it's a lot.\" \n\nYou used this as an opportunity to correct her and admonish her instead of offering her support. You also made your help contingent on her doing more. What seems like a small thing to you isn't to her. She's probably literally got her hands full with your daughter and you're telling her how to better clean up after herself than offering to shoulder the burden as you should have.\n\nYou reap the benefits of her flexible schedule without acknowledging that just because it's easier for her to take off work doesn't mean she's not taking on the more challenging task by staying home with your daughter for a week.\n\nWhat chores do you do? If she's getting your daughter up and putting her to bed because your schedule necessitates it you should be finding ways to offset that *WITHOUT* her needing to tell you she's overwhelmed. I'm astonished that, when she communicated her feelings you still couldn't step up to the plate.\n\nDo better.", ">I responded calmly by saying that I can't miss work or reduce hours. We simply cannot afford it.\n\nTo paraphrase, your initial response was that the issue she was having a breakdown about was her problem to solve, not yours.\n\n>She responded...

YTA for not reading the room and realizing that your wife just needed a supportive ear. How tone-deaf, OP. And to add injury to insult, you *vented to your coworker*, the literal same thing your wife was trying to do with you. How can you not see that? Stop trying to patronize your wife, be supportive, she's pulling a lot of weight.", "She's not mad at you for offering to wash dishes. She's mad that she was venting about being overwhelmed with keeping up with everything & you responded by pointing out one of her failings:\n\n>But I do not want to play scavenger hunt and look around the house for things to wash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI myself do not understand people who leave empty glasses, plates & whatever around the house. But, I'm not caring for an infant. Some things are going to slip down the priority list when you have a baby to care for. You should have assured her that she's getting the really important stuff right & simply asked what you could do to help out more. Instead, you made her feel much worse. Your coworker is right, YTA. If collecting dishware & putting it in the dishwasher is what helps your wife, you should do that.", "YTA, my mom takes care of my disabled dad, if I get home and my mom is crying because she is rightfully tired, I get immediately to wash the dishes, laudry or whatever I SEE that needs to be done, and check if they need groceries. You don't look at an overwhelmed person and tells them it is their fault, you get in action without \"if\" and \"but\". \n\nHow big is your house that it would be too hard to pick up dishes from other rooms? How long would it take doing the dishes for 2 and half people? I have handwashed dishes for 10+ people, including pans and it takes me about 30 minutes.\n\nYou are both tired, yes, but YTA because you are not really keeping your part as a husband and parent.\n\nETA, I just reread and you work 4 days a week, what do you do the other 3 days?", "YTA. Your wife told you she\u2019s mentally and physically exhausted and is struggling and your response to her is that it\u2019s mostly her fault but you\u2019ll do this one thing for her as long as she makes it easy on you? Dude, it\u2019s your child and your house too. Man up and do your share and support your wife.", "YTA \n\nShe was having an emotionally vulnerable moment, that wasn\u2019t the time to criticise her, which is what you did.", "YTA\n\nYou seem to think that house work is limited to washing up.\n\nWhat about hoovering, cleaning the bathroom, mopping the kitchen floor, emptying the bins, the endless laundry created by a small child?", "YTA. \n\nShe\u2019s feeling overwhelmed the last thing she needs is a lecture from you. The response should have been that you will do more to help around the house and then later when she\u2019s cooled down, you could initiate a conversation about ways that you could BOTH change some of your habits to make the housework more manageable. \n\nI know you are working 12 hour shifts, but think about your work life balance compared to hers. If you go to work and then feel like since you work more hours you\u2019re allowed to come home and do nothing then it\u2019s no surprise she\u2019s frustrated and you need to do way more than the dishes. If she\u2019s working 8 hours, picking up the kid, coming home to cook for all of you, cleaning up after everyone, etc and is never getting a break from work or from being a mom and a housemaid and a personal chef of course she\u2019s stressed out. When you\u2019re constantly overworked and exhausted mentally and physically of course you\u2019re gonna start developing bad habits. Many times when someone is in a bad headspace you can see it reflected in their surroundings because they don\u2019t have the capacity to do those small things like picking up after yourself as you go. \n\nBe more compassionate to your wife. Also idk what you\u2019re talking about going on a scavenger hunt for things to wash\u2026 so if the chore isn\u2019t conveniently set up for you to do then you can\u2019t do it? Seems petty. It\u2019s reasonable to ask her to be more mindful about picking up after herself but you need to be more supportive.", "YTA. Wow\u2026got creative with that tile, didn\u2019t ya?\nShe is overwhelmed with everything. You only offered to help with one thing. \n\nYou will help with dishes\u2026but only on your terms. It\u2019s like you chose the *one* chore that would allow you to also tear her even further down.", "YTA\n\nYou took a very vulnerable moment when your wife was confided in you that she was overwhelmed to criticize her and say it was 90% her own fault. I'm not going to disagree that the things you say seem to be logical, but you've presumably been together several years at least at this point, you've had every opportunity to offer constructive criticism, waiting until she's having a breakdown to basically say \"well it's all your fault, but if you change, then I'll help out a bit more too\". You no doubt made her feel more overwhelmed right now. When someone is at rock bottom and opening up about not coping, they need you to listen, not have a go at them.\n\nYou could have tackled it by saying \"okay this weekend let's really focus together on catching up with all the housework that's piling up, and then we'll have a chat about it.\" Then, when the house is clean, she's not feeling overwhelmed, that is the time to have a chat about how you got to that place in the first place and what can be done about it in the future by BOTH of you.\n\nBecause a successful marriage is teamwork. Not telling someone they're doing it wrong.", "YTA. She needed to vent and needs help. You gave her a lecture instead.", "YTA. She confided in you and your response is \u201cwell you\u2019re a slob and it\u2019s all your fault and I can\u2019t possibly help unless you do 95% of the work first\u201d. \n\nBe better.", "Your wife is working a full-time job, has most of the responsibility for your child,and seems to be responsible for all of the housework and cooking as well. (Doing the math, that's four full-time jobs).\n\nWhen she shared how stressed and overwhelmed she was feeling, you schooled her in how she could better tidy up as if she hadn't been doing all the work in the home for ages, then said if she made it super easy for you (i.e., never left a coffee cup in the living room, presumably?), you'd do one chore a day in the home the two of you share. She didn't challenge you, just said okay quietly and went to take care of your daughter, but maybe because she didn't seem incredibly grateful about your so-generous offer, you felt you had to complain about her at work, and even your co-worker wasn't on your side. \n\nYes, buddy...YTA", "INFO: are chores split 50/50?

You suck and you need to take on more housework and stop acting like what your wife does all day isn't just as tiring as your job.\n\nIf your wife is untidy I can understand that being frustrating but you definitely could've been kinder.  She was coming to you needing consolation and you turned it around and made it seem like it was her fault she was feeling overwhelmed.", "So it\u2019s more than the dishes here. It sounds like you need to set a routine to clean together. My spouse and I are always adjusting ours since I moved from office to telework and he kind of did the opposite.

As of now she is the main breadwinner in this household and you need a reality check!", "YTA. Sometimes you do the dishes and take the garbage and you call that equitable?

That was assholery, my dude.\n\nETA: I've heard of couples who have each granted each other a 5-minute vent session a day so they can get stuff off their chest/decompress.

If she just put the used butter knifes in the   \nsink after she was done, and rinsed bottles/cookware/etc. I will happily  \n do the dishes when I get home from work. \n\nSo to be clear... right now you don't do anything to help, but you'd be willing to do ONE task IF she prepares it for you by doing the \"scavenger hunt\" part of the task... and you think you taking on the washing/putting away part of the dishes is 90% of her cleaning?! YTA YTA YTA my god YTA.", "Your title is misleading and yeah, you are the asshole for how you spoke/treated her. She\u2019s voicing her stress and her feelings and your solution is \u201cpick up after yourself\u201d?! Your wife is working 3 jobs and the only one that can vent is you apparently, cause she did the exact same thing you did with your coworker and you invalidated her feelings. You probably 1% of the house work yet I bet you think your wife has it easier than you because she doesn\u2019t \u201cwork\u201d as many hours as you\u2026", "https://english.emmaclit.com/2019/01/12/the-consequences/\n\nEducate yourself and adjust", "YTA for telling her she\u2019s basically slovenly and the mess is her fault. You have a baby in the house that your wife is sole carer for when she\u2019s at home and she does the majority of the housework too. Step up and be a partner to her, don\u2019t put her down by telling her shit that isn\u2019t helpful.", "YTA because sometimes when ppl talk they are not asking you to fix the problem they are just looking for understanding and validation of their feelings.\n\nYou totally missed the point, at that point she needed a cuddle and for you to say i didnt realise you felt this way and im here for you. \n\nThe next step is not to say what you can do or point out why you think she could make life easier as this is her problem so she needs to be able to feel incontrol of finding a solution. So you just say, what do you need? What can i do for you? \n\nSo now you have validated her feelings, told her you understood and are willing to do what ever she needs to help her feel better and also let her know that although she feels like this now, the situation can get better and she wont always feel this way.\n\nSometimes ppl just need to be heard and not told well you wouldnt feel like this if you did x,y,z!\n\nA problem shared is a problem halved.", "YTA and let me explain to you why. \nShe might only work 8 hours of paid time but when she gets home she\u2019s doing according to you 95% of the household and child duties. She technically never clocks out. She missed a week of work and will probably have to catch up there. While she was cleaning a house and taking care of a sick child. Yet your only response was to tell her how to clean a house you never clean. You have 3 days off what are you doing in those days to help her load be less? How are you contributing to your household when you\u2019re off the clock? She was asking for your help/support not asking for you to insult which was what you did when you told her you had to hunt down dishes.", "Making her feel worse, suggesting that the reason she\u2019s struggling is her fault, and being directly critical, is not nice.\n\nYour title is misleading. But, ask yourself why these are her dishes for you to help with, and why they\u2019re not also your responsibility?\n\nYTA", "YTA and even more so for telling her to \u2018pick up after herself\u2019. She\u2019s supposed to be your partner, not your housemaid.", "YTA. Sometimes things aren't that literal.

You don\u2019t need to be told what chores to do. You can look around and the moment you see one that needs doing, do it. Without fussing, criticising or demanding praise for doing it.

Should be easy, right?", "At some point she will realize she is better off without you.", "YTA you are a grown adult. You should be sharing the household workload equally during your non working hours with her without needing direction as if you are a child. You are capable of just doing the dishes or vacuuming or laundry if you see they need to be done. You don\u2019t need a written invitation from your wife.

She is overwhelmed. And rightfully so. It sounds like she has to be at the point of breakdown for you to offer to do the bare minimum, and to offer with stipulations and a side of shade. There is a lot that goes into taking care of the house. Not just doing all the things but actually remembering when they need to be done. Scheduling all the appts. Planning meals, shopping for them, cooking them and then cleaning them. Not just tidying hut actual cleaning. Laundry. You get to get up and leave for work without having to even think of doing anything for your child. You get home and its almost the same. She is taking care of the child you decided to have together all while working almost the same hours as you at another job. And when they are that small they require a lot of attention.

One of the easiest chores. How about you offer to spend time with your kid to give her a break? You know..... LIKE A FATHER.\n\nIf you have to work so much that you miss, oh, all her milestones, maybe it's time to adjust things. Reduce spending, look for a job with less hours but equal or similar pay.\n\nMaybe some dishes aren't in the sink because, and I know this may sound new to you, 1 year olds are \"drop the dish or bring it with\" sometimes if they're in need of attention. Which is better: a dish in the living room or a mess of food on the floor?\n\nDude, you need to be a parent and a partner. Not a worker drone. YTA", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, you have 3 days a week off.

THESE ARE THINGS YOU SHOULD ALREADY BE DOING. \n\nThird, what exactly are you doing to relieve your wife\u2019s stress with your kid? What parental responsibilities are you picking up?", "YTA, not for offering to do the dishes for not listening and for immediately pointing the finger at her. Women often vent because we just want to be heard and see that our feelings are understood. Not everything we say we want an immediate solution to. Start practicing asking 'do you want some input or do you just wanna be heard?' and respect the answer given (with the exception that there will be sometimes that input is a must)", "You openly admitted the only chores you do are taking out the trash and SOMETIMES doing the dishes. So your wife bears the load of both parenting your infant child AND doing the majority of the housework. All while working a full time job.\n\nHowever, even with all of that in mind, you have the audacity to critique and insult her instead of offering emotional support or ACTUAL help.\n\nYou've got some big balls, bud. YTA.", "Sounds like right now, you work 48 hours a week, and your wife works 32 hours a week, PLUS 24/7 for your family, and yet you still need to ask strangers on the internet if that's fair or not...

You and your wife need to have a gentle but serious conversation about all the things that go into your shared lives, and come up with a more equitable and sustainable solution.  YTA, do better.", "YTA. Besides the misleading title, your primary error here was not actually listening to her concern but instead trying to explain it away, with an unhealthy dollop of blaming her.\n\n*She feels overwhelmed*. Your initial response isn't to acknowledge or validate her feeling but to say, \"I can't miss work or reduce hours.\" That's not replying to what she's saying; that's replying to something you imagined, namely, \"Why don't you do more?\" You just turned an expression of frustration into a request that you turned down, without ever figuring out how she actually felt or what she actually needed.\n\nThen she continues the conversation and tries explaining that it feels overwhelming, that the chores are piling up. Rather than unpacking what she means by all that and exploring what you could do, you immediately jump to blaming 90% of the situation on her. You don't even realize that maybe some of those things don't get done because she's overwhelmed with all the other chores she has to keep up with. Then you set up this conditional: you'll do the dishes, but *you won't gather them up*. In other words, you'll do one minor task, but she has to work harder for you to even do **that**. That's not a panacea; that's piling on. \n\nCan you imagine how it feels to be overwhelmed, to seek acknowledgement and understanding from your partner, and to only receive in response judgment, a very conditional offer of help on *one* thing, and a sense you're not doing enough? In this case, the reasonable thing is listening to your partner, figuring out what the issue is, and working through it together, not the calm unlistening AH-ery you demonstrated.", "YTA.   \n\n\nBecause 'I'll do the dishes if you do 80% of the work' is bullshit.  \n\n\nWho is doing all the laundry?  And cleaning the bathrooms?  And scrubbing the kitchen?  And...  \n\n\nPull your own weight, like a grown up.  Taking out the trash is a once or twice a week thing.

If you've never stayed home with a little one, it is extremely hard work, and it's easy to forget about putting dishes away when you're trying to concentrate on multiple things at once. \n\nYour wife wasn't asking for advice. She was venting. All you needed to do was say, \"I know it's hard and that you're working hard to take care of our little one. What can I do to make this easier for you?\" Instead, you lectured her about the mess, which is not helpful. \n\nYTA", "YTA.  She is doing 100% of the childcare, cooking and cleaning.  Your work hours are irrelevant.  Your wife is basically a single working mother with zero help from you.  You shouldn\u2019t be offering to help.  You should be automatically picking up more of the household and mental load.  You need to realize she is sacrificing her work reputation by taking time off to care for YOUR child, you know the one you don\u2019t even see.  You need to realize that all she is getting out if you is money and she can get that after divorcing you, so basically you don\u2019t bring anything different to the table whether she is married to or divorced from you.", "A soft YTA. My wife was a full time mom after our daughters were born, and she was always wiped out and certainly wouldn\u2019t have liked me lecturing her about chores. Plus the scavenger hunt for dirty dishes takes \u2014 what? \u2014 3 minutes? Not the hill to die on. As a man, I didn\u2019t appreciate how physically taxing childbearing and nursing is. It gets better. But until then, she really needs your help without the snarky \u201cadvice\u201d.", "I understand your point, but your timing sucks.

A wicker basket in the living room to collect all the crap that doesn\u2019t belong there. A wicker basket at the bottom of the stairs for all the stuff that belongs up stairs. But all she heard was I eork a lot and your a slob, fix it.", "I'm gonna bypass the whole 'who's the asshole' thing and suggest you guys have a good in-depth conversation about paid work, domestic work and finances, as it sounds like your current arrangement isn't working well anymore.\n\nWho knows, maybe it's time to look at a switching of roles, for instance her going back to work full-time and you doing part-time in order to do childcare pick-up and the household work.  Or perhaps there's a scenario where she goes back to work full-time, you guys use the extra money to pay for some additional childcare arrangements, and then split the household chores 50/50.\n\nI don't disagree with your point about saying it's faster to do housework if you clear up as you go along, but I think there's a deeper issue here about mental overload for her which needs to be addressed.", "I wish I could be so lucky to have a man like you. You offered to do the dishes when you get home if everything is in the sink ready for you? SWOON!!! \n\nI sure hope you picked up the sarcasm there. YTA for so many reasons. You are supposed to be partners, but for some reason you think everything involving the house and kid is your wife\u2019s responsibility. You admittedly often get home from work after the kid is in bed. Do you even know how taxing it is to take care of a child on your own? Play with them, cook for them, entertain them, clean them up, get them ready for bed. After all of that, she then needs to clean the house for her prince of a husband who can\u2019t be bothered to help clean up because it isn\u2019t \u201chis\u201d mess. She is your wife, not your servant.\n\nI\u2019m going to say this once and I hope you hear me. The reason you are able to work your job is because you have a partner at home taking care of your house and kid, while working a job herself. Without her doing what she does, you would not be able to work in the manner you do without expending more money on assistance. Which is something you should consider before your wife divorces you and you need to figure these things out on your own. \n\nYou need to do more than the dishes. A lot more. Before you do that, you owe your wife a gigantic apology. FFS.", "I mean you're technically right, 90% of her problems are her own fault - she married you.\n\n YTA, come on. Your wife who already gave up part of her job for childcare and does the majority of the housework and parenting came to you for help, and your answer was to blame her and do nothing? \n\nNews flash: working more doesn't excuse you from raising your own kid. It doesn't excuse you from it even if you made 100% of the money. Get up off your arse and start doing actual work around the house, daily, before she realizes an unsupportive partner is just extra work she doesn't need.", "NTA your wife isn\u2019t a child and she should pick up after herself.", "4 8 hour shifts and can't keep up w chores? That sounds ridiculous to me. Does your daughter or wife have any health issues that are taking up more time?", "Oh cool, more misandry! She leaves shit all over the house but he is supposed to clean it all up, got it\u2026 NTA", "I\u2019m completely surprised at all the people who think it is normal to a abandon dishes throughout the house all day.", "going to go against the flow a little here,  but NAH.   This is a sucky situation all the way around.   She is working  40 hours a week, he is working 48.   Daycare provider is sick,  someone has to take time off work.   Wife takes the time off, he picks up an extra day so they can makes ends meet.    What he is saying is common sense and what we should be teaching our kids from an early age, \"Don't leave your dishes laying all over the house,   Rinse them off and put them in the sink when you are done with them.   Wash the pots and pans promptly rather then letting everything dry and take 3 times as long to get off\"     It is much easier to avoid being overwhelmed by housework if you don't try to put everything off until the baby is in bed.    If you wait, it isn't going to get done.  If the kids are asleep and you have to gather dishes, wash 3 meals worth of dishes, wipe down the tables before you even start cleaning the living/doing laundry/taking out trash, etc it is way more daunting.    I was a full time stay at home mom of 3 kids for 14 years.   Quite often my husband was deployed for up to a year at a time and I was completely responsible for everything in the household.     \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is already working 12 hour days.    Yes, she is responsible for taking care of their child  but if the baby is already asleep when he gets home,  is she doing household chores the rest of the time  until he gets home or is she taking a break because she is tired?      He isn't sitting at a bar having one with the guys, he is working to provide for their family.

She probably wants to put everything away too, but is a little too overwhelmed to develop that habit at the moment. She's just asking for more help overall.

Don't make the mistake of thinking another kid is going to fix this", "NAH, but you're being a total man about it. I mean, yes, your response is the practical and well reasoned solution, but that's not what she needs. She needs to know that you recognize that she's feeling overwhelmed and empathize with her.
