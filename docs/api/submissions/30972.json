We live in a studio apartment that I inherited years ago so our bed is in front of the only TV, which is also connected to my boyfriend's PC/Xbox. There have been multiple times that he has come home from work at 4-4:20pm and I will be sitting on the bed nursing the baby and watching TV and he will just grab the remote, sit directly in front of the TV (so I can't see the TV at all) and do whatever he wants (YouTube or gaming). I've brought it up several times in both conversations and petty comments (\"yup, I definitely wasn't watching that or anything\") and it's always a \"I worked all day, I just want to relax\" or a \"you got the TV all day, if I want to watch YouTube or play a game after working, I should be able to\". And honestly, it's not an issue of whether or not he should be able to. Of course he should. He busted his ass all day. But it's the disrespect I can't get over. It's the fact that he sees me watching something and doesn't care; just switches it off and sits directly in front of the TV without saying anything to me. \n\nWhen he did it the day before yesterday I had a bit of a flip out moment because my show was over in 20 minutes anyhow and he could have just waited. I told him if he did that shit again I would be cutting off the Internet (I had it paid up for a year and it's in my name). He said some \"I'm sorry babe, I just had a bad fucking day and want to relax and you get the TV all the time\". Again, the issue is not him wanting to use the TV. It's the fact that he takes over the TV without so much as a \"can I turn this off and use it?\" I told him that. I told him communication goes a long way. I thought the conversation went well but apparently not because as soon as he got home last night he was pissed off (bad day at work) and grabbed the remote from my hand and immediately took over the TV. So I shut off the internet. He is pissed at me saying that he shouldn't have to ask first and that since I saw he was having a bad day, I should have just stepped back and not done something I knew would piss him off further.\n\nETA: My show gets over at 4:30, 15-20 minutes after he gets home. He can wait. Especially considering he turns on his game and then goes to eat dinner that I prepared for him anyways so the game just sits there untouched until he's finished eating", "created_utc": 1699976496, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17v4y0o/aita_for_turning_the_internet_off_after_my/", "score": 260, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is effectively showing that your BF has no manners or that he doesn't think that manners should apply to you when he's angry. Not a good look. I'm also a little curious if you BF equates a day of childcare to watching TV all day... because it's not. NTA. \n\nPersonally, if this keeps this up I'd consider pulling a parenting 101 move and removing the tv from the apartment entirely for a week to punish the household collectively.", "NTA\n\nYou two sound like your teens though. \n\nYour BF is a punk. He needs to grow the hell up and learn some manners, why the hell did you make a baby with this guy?", "SIs, you are home with a newborn - its not like you are sitting around eating bon bons all day. Even if you ARE sitting around, you are up with the baby multiple times per night and watching a show during marathon nursing sessions is NOT just \"sitting around all day watching TV\".\n\nYou warned him to check himself, his behavior and his disrespect towards you and then followed through with your reaction. NTA. He needs to figure out how to behave kindly to the mother of his child because he is acting like a petulant teenager.", "NTA. He's treating you with contempt. Your problems are much larger than the TV watching.", "Y T A to your self for reproducing with this misogynistic selfish asshole with an anger problem and not setting hard boundariea about his behavior. Tell him the nexr time he does it the xbox goes and no gaming on the PC. If he refuses? Throw him out. Seriously. You were NOT at home relaxing with the TV all day, you are recovering from a major medical trauma (all birth involves injury including a dinner plate sized wound on the uterus do not @ me people) and CARING FOR HIS CHILD. You are working through a meducal leave and this ashole thinks you have been lazing around and \"got the TV all day\".\n\nNTA but do yourself and your baby a favor and get this shitty disrespectful asshole in line NOW or get him gone and file for child support.", "NTA but I have a feeling there\u2019s a bigger issue going on here. I wonder if he\u2019s harboring some resentment against you, some people mistaking my see maternity leave as a vacation and the fact that your show is on at the time he gets home he probably thinks, wrongly, bc that\u2019s what he sees when he gets home that you\u2019re probably doing that all day. I\u2019m not saying that excuses his behavior but his possible resentment and communication issues are what really need to be addressed. Maybe look into couples counseling to help you guys get through this bc what he\u2019s doing is not ok", "My goodness, seems he\u2019s making you responsible for raising TWO babies. I\u2019m missing what country or culture you\u2019re living in, but where I\u2019m from you are NTA and his behavior borders on abuse as well as being incredibly immature.

You can do better.", "NTA\n\nHe doesn't get to take his bad day out on you by being a douchecannoe to you. Respect is a two way street and he needs to start showing you a heck of a lot more of it.  If he views having to wait -30mins for the TV as disrespectful to him you have a much bigger problem here.", "[removed]", "NTA and I would be furious too; \"past me\" would have wanted to be just as petty and leave him with the baby for a few hours while I went and did whatever I wanted to do every time he just decided I didn't exist. I don't have kids so I don't really know how feasible that is at whatever age your baby is.\n\nSince you think getting another TV is not feasible, if you can financially afford it, get a tablet or another small portable device (Black Friday is coming up depending on where you're from). Honestly, I personally prefer watching shows on my tablet or phone because I can take it wherever I am and put some headphones in and block out the noise from my gamer as well.\n\nI'm not sure what show you're watching and if you can watch it on Netflix or some other app or if you can get your cable or TV provider's app on your phone or tablet, but that would be a great option.", "NTA. You are also busting your ass all day. Being postpartum and caring for a baby is WORK. \n\nYour boyfriend is dismissive, rude and disrespectful. It doesn't matter if he had a bad day. You're not his emotional punching bag and he can learn to handle bad days like a mature adult. Also, if he *must* watch something on youtube immediately, he has a phone doesn't he? \n\nI would have a big conversation with him to address all the ways he is disrespectful and let him know that you will no longer tolerate it. When he comes home, after decompressing for no more than 30 minutes, he should be caring for his child so *you* can get a break. He should be cleaning up after himself at least. You're not his servant at the ready when his highness finally deigns to eat dinner.", "My wife would straight up leave me if I disrespected her like this on the regular. And she'd be right to do so.

He can't even claim to just be ignorant as you have talked to him about it and explained how it makes you feel. \n\nThe only way to get through to someone who doesn't care how what they do makes *you* feel is to make *them* feel bad from some kind of negative consequence. That extreme would be completely unnecessary if they had any empathy for others and were willing to listen and compromise. \n\nTLDR: Oafs get the rap on the knuckles.", "NTA but your bf sure is. The disrespect is unreal. How do you tolerate it?", "Sounds like he's blaming you for making him mad. Also sounds like he's heard your complaints and is letting you know he isn't planning to shape up. So now you have to decide what you're going to do with this information. Do I continue living miserably in a tiny box with a guy I'm basically letting live here for free and my tiny child, or do I let this guy know that if he can't respect me he can find someplace else to watch TV and have his pity party after work? \n\nWhat in the actual hell is going on with people?", "I'm not telling you to leave the guy, because I don't know you or your relationship but I can tell you that I'd leave the guy. Not even for what he's doing with the TV and remote. But for the things he said when you brought it up how it bothers you. You exist to serve him and be a nanny. That's the vibe I get from his response. Is this the relationship you want?", "NTA but also... buy a second TV? They're like $200-300 for a decent new TV. He's being incredibly rude, but also this fight doesn't need to keep happening.", "[removed]", "I have a bit of an ESH feeling here.\n\nHe's a butt cuz he won't talk to you. It sounds like you don't even get a \"hi honey. hi baby.\" he just runs to the remote (and if it's in your hand the least he can do is say hi) but that's me. I'm a \"you don't come in and not speak to me\" kinda person.\n\nthat aside. You're asking for simple communication, something that isn't that hard. Just a \"when this is over, let me know so I can have the tv.\" it's not like you're asking him to do a river dance for your entertainment while he games.\n\nNow you. You're a butt because you \"understand\" that he should be able to come home from work and do whatever cuz he busted his ass all day, but as soon as he does this, you make it a hill to die on.\n\nNow for me. I love the turning off the internet thing and am gonna use that, for different situations, like someone didn't get their homework done and is on YouTube, or someone straight up disrespects me in my own home and thinks they can finish their season of the young and the restless... IDK what people watch, I've been binging Big Mouth as of late.\n\nNow moving forward. Y'all could get another tv, smaller, and mount it on the wall on the other side of the bed. He can wear headphones (I say HE can because with gaming there's usually things like talking to teammates and he'd benefit the most out of being the one with a headset.)\n\nBut also... moving forward, y'all need better communication. You have to be going a little stir crazy with only the baby to talk to seeing as he barely talks to you. and he needs to talk to you about his day and not just expect you to read his mind and judge the badness of his days.", "You\u2019re both assholes\u2026 glad you found each other so no one else gets stuck with you.", "Get a second TV and a headset!", "Nobody is the asshole. It's hard to exist as two separate humans in a space, which quite frankly is built for one. \n\nYou need to buy another TV. And a chair or something. Then you both get your ways. Ta daaaaaa", "You can only afford one TV? ESH", "He work all day to support you and the baby and you complain about a damn tv yeah you inherited the studio but he the one that keep on the bill and still feed y\u2019all if you just complain about tv maybe it a good ideas for you and him to live separately not together the way you acting just for a tv it not good for the baby", ">the issue is not him wanting to use the TV. It's the fact that he takes over the TV without so much as a \"can I turn this off and use it?\" \n\nESH, Everyone Sucks Here.\n\nHe's obviously a rude asshole. Period.\n\nBut if you don't have an issue with him wanting TV when he gets home, then don't get midway into your own show around that time.  Turning off the internet was petty and Mom-ish.\n\nThe two of you are probably headed for a lot more of these nonsense arguments if you're living in a single room with a baby to boot.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You need to get him to go to couples counseling because he strikes me as the type to not listen to anyone but a 3rd party (maybe not even then, but at least you gave it a shot.)

We recruited 40 men \u2013 20 in Spain and 20 in California \u2013 and put each into an MRI scanner twice: first during their partner\u2019s pregnancy, and again after their baby was 6 months old. We also included a control group of 17 childless men.\n\n>We found several\u00a0significant changes in the brains of fathers\u00a0from prenatal to postpartum that did not emerge within the childless men we followed across the same time period. In both the Spanish and Californian samples, fathers\u2019 brain changes appeared in regions of the cortex that contribute to visual processing, attention and empathy toward the baby.\n\nNot just changes in the brain.
