Before anyone asks, my husband (26M) suggested this in the first place and fully supports my decision. My SIL has always been very spoiled: she got a new car for her 16th birthday, didn\u2019t pay most of her bills in college, and is currently living rent and responsibility free (no chores, bills, or even taking care of her own pets) with her fianc\u00e9 in her grandmother\u2019s house. She\u2019s even told people all she has to do is ask her grandmother for something or to pay her way, and it\u2019ll be done that instant. It is also important to add that she was in my wedding last year. \nCurrent Situation:\nShe never officially asked me or the other girls/ women if we want to be bridesmaids. She just added us to a group chat and that was that. Ever since, she has been a bit of a bridezilla. If I mentioned I couldn\u2019t go do something because my husband and I were saving for a house, she would say \u201cYou\u2019d only have to miss a day or two of work\u201d. When I asked her about which color/ shade she wanted our bridesmaid\u2019s dresses to be, she said \u201cIt\u2019s the same on all the websites, just different names\u201d without telling which one was which. The final straw was last week when I explained to her I wouldn\u2019t be able to have my hair fully up because of the length, but I would try to do mostly up or half up. She replied with \u201cI\u2019m sure you can find a way to do it up. You have time to figure it out before the wedding\u201d. On Monday, I sent her \u201cHey, (husband) and I talked about it and have decided that it would be better if I were not to be a bridesmaid. With me being pregnant, I don\u2019t want to add additional stress or increase any risks I already have. I\u2019m not sure that I will feel good enough to, I\u2019m having a hard time finding a dress that will fit as well. I\u2019m sorry that this is short notice. I just don\u2019t think I can do what you envision and be who you need me to be.\u201d She has not answered my text, but I heard from a family member that she is pissed off and not in a momentary or minor way either. At this point, I want to tell her that if she has such little regard for me and my child\u2019s health and safety, then she doesn\u2019t have to be an aunt.

She hasn\u2019t returned your text and you\u2019ve heard she\u2019s mad. She hasn\u2019t confronted you about it, why would you \u201cand another thing\u201d on this? You pulled out of the wedding party, move on before you become TA.", "You're not the asshole. But if you continue to push this and say things like she doesn't care about you or the baby, then you're definitely going to look like the asshole. Be the bigger person. Focus on your baby. Eventually after the wedding she'll pretend like nothing happened. Don't let narcissists like her get to you, they're definitely not worried about what they did and asking people if they're the asshole ... Get my drift?", "NAH but you're going from 0 to 100 here. Take this as a lesson in practicing better communication skills, because you could've spoken up from the get go instead you went along with this nonsense until you backed out, and now you're threatening to remove as an aunt because...? she has every right to feel some kinda way about her SIL dropping out of her wedding all of a sudden. let her stew and she will get over it. you've obviously never liked her and let your resentment for her fester. tbh, grow up.", "NAH\n\nI'm not seeing where she's being terrible. A bit absentminded, or unconcerned, but not super demanding or difficult.", "NTA.  You have more that one sound reason not to be involved.  As you said you were never asked, she just assumed.  I\u2019d just let her stew and throw her entitled toddler tantrums.  In the end it is her who looks bad.  You look after yourself and your pregnancy as that\u2019s 100 times more important than her wedding.", "ESH. You sound jealous.", "YTA - if you were this concerned about your health, you should have dropped out when you found out you were pregnant.", "NTA.  Weddings are a big commitment to be be in.  I would not stoke the fire with the not being an aunt comment.  Be above the petty.", "So far NTA. But you would be if you contact her any further. If she\u2019s mad, she\u2019s mad. It\u2019s whatever. She hasn\u2019t brought the fight to you, so don\u2019t bring it to her either. You said your piece, just let it be.", "NTA.  You should have used your pregnancy as an excuse and declined from the start.", "Thank you for the support and explanations for your rationale everyone! A few of you suggested I leave the situation as it is which I was already planning to do so. I just genuinely wanted to know if I should\u2019ve said something sooner or just stuck it out. No, I am not actually going to tell her she doesn\u2019t have to be an aunt. It was how I felt in the moment; that\u2019s it. Thanks again!", "NTA\nCould be even 2 days before, you can't risk having a seizure in the middle of the ceremony. Just don't create drama around yourself. Because you seem to be a little jealous that she is spoiled. That info wasn't necessary.", "NTA\n\nYou might be a people pleaser, but you aren't an AH for setting a boundary for you and your child's health. 2 months before the wedding,  that's plenty of time to get another friend to be a bride's maid. They have enough time to get a dress and get off of work,  so you've given get plenty of time.  She's also shown you that she's not willing to compromise with you about your hair,  she's not being specific about the dress when you've asked for clarification as well. So it sounds like she was already annoyed and this has just set her off for some reason. You're being completely reasonable about this. \n\nHowever,  don't do the \"you don't have to be an aunt\" thing.  She's gonna be an aunt no matter what, ya know? Until she shows you that she doesn't want to be in the baby's life or is putting the baby in danger when she's around, don't pull that card out.  It sounds kinda like the bride to be is a bit immature and doesn't understand how stressful it can be to be pregnant at all, especially when you're already high risk.  And you're absolutely correct in saying you might not even be able to do all this bride's maid stuff in two months time.  A lot of high risk pregnancies end up in bed rest for the last month or so.\n\n No, you're not the AH. Keep boundaries firm and stand your ground, but don't fight fire with fire. Good luck with everything and I hope your pregnancy goes really well and everyone is super happy and healthy!", "NTA. Your health comes first. 2 months is plenty of time for her to find a replacement for you. Concentrate on YOUR family, not her.", "NTA. Being a bridesmaid is a big favor to the bride, and you have no obligation to do it. Just being pregnant and high risk is plenty reason enough to bow out. But you've already told her, so just leave it at that. You don't need to contact her again.", "NTA but just stop here. You handled it well your reasons make sense, let her throw her fit let her act a fool and you just keep taking care of yourself and your family and hold the line. Don\u2019t match her crazy", "I would maybe not cut her out of being an aunt yet. It sounds like maybe down the road, the right opportunity will present itself.\n\nBut now, yes, focus on the health of you and your child. Also, you didn't say you wouldn't come at all, just that you were not up to the task of being a bridesmaid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, and good luck.", "NTA... you handled it perfectly.", "NTA. Your wellbeing and that of your baby come first. And the not asking but assuming part throws me; being a bridesmaid can be a huge commitment, she shouldn't just assume people are up for it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t want to share too many personal and familial details about her reaction because I didn\u2019t see or hear it myself.

I understand that it\u2019s stressful planning a wedding seeing as I did it myself last year. I backed out because her requests became impossible and the stress was too much for me to bare while pregnant. I included she was entitled because I thought it would draw in context to why she may be feeling this way or making these requests. I apologize if my compliance with her in the beginning of the wedding planning seemed to be a lack of communication instead of my willing but unable to make her dream wedding happen. I also haven\u2019t been pregnant the entire time since she\u2019s told me I was a bridesmaid. I also didn\u2019t threaten to prevent her from being an aunt, just felt that way in the moment.

I've never heard of anyone's hair so long that they couldn't possibly wear it up. I've seen youtubers with hair to their feet put their hair up. Idk.\n\nAnd without knowing how many days the bride is wanting OP to take off--\n\nYeah, really not seeing a bridezilla here.\n\nStop listening to what other people say, OP, for things you don't hear/witness yourself.

Try not to schedule your baby shower close to her wedding at least.", "I would never do that. I may not be a bridesmaid anymore, but I have no interest in being petty or vengeful.
