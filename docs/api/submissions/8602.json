They have a great variety of items to send every month or every other month. You know, so the newlyweds are reminded of your thoughtfulness throughout their first year.

Get something you know she and her husband will like and use. Wedding gifts really are about the thought, and they commemorate an important event. (And that means that, when you don't give any gift, that is remembered and can be really hurtful.)

Then there will be no issue. NTA.", "NTA. You have gone above and beyond to accommodate for all of her wedding plans so you can be there for her. So, I assume you love her & have a generally good relationship with her. My only concern would be your own desire to give her a present & that you may feel a bit sad about it once the frustration wears off. I personally find a lot of joy in gift giving & tend to opt for more sentimental things (mostly bc I\u2019m broke lol)\n\nSome things I\u2019ve done in the past: \n- photo album (scrapbook style or through Walgreens, depending on what the person receiving would presumably like more) \n- framed photo with pressed flowers (grab some mod podge, some pressed flowers, a totally clear frame & a picture. Bonus points if you write or type up a sweet paragraph on the back of the picture)\n- mixed CD filled with songs from your childhood (yes people still love it, especially if it includes a QR code to the playlist online) \n- I like to throw in a nice book that\u2019s relevant or sentimental or both. I usually buy vintage books for the aesthetic. \n- don\u2019t forget to include an excellent card & wrap it all beautifully. These things will make or break the way someone will perceive the gift. \n\nYou can always get something cheap from her registry & throw something more handmade/sentimental in there too. Obviously, you know yourself & your sister best so it\u2019s fine if you hate all of those suggestions or think she would.

You didn't have to go to the bachelorette party. You could have left your toddler with MIL instead of flying them both with you and paying for a hotel room. You could have found a cheaper dress, cheaper shoes, etc. \n\nSince you admit you can afford it, I think getting no gift is more about making a statement that you're annoyed. Gifts aren't required, but it's pretty tacky to not give anything to your own sibling when you can easily afford to do so. \n\nTo be clear, I'd feel differently if money was an issue for you.
