To even think that you'd be all \"yay wedding\" so soon after losing her, to say little of their appalling pressure to you on their wedding day a week and a half after losing your mother, is ridiculous. You were 11! You needed support and understanding and to have your father on your side. \n\nThat Eve is *still* harping on about it years and years and years later... wow. Woman needs therapy or something. The fact that everyone else save for Eve and your dad and your young siblings (who have been listening to Eve all their lives) are understanding of why you didn't attend their wedding shows that you are not at fault in any shape or form. It's horrible and cruel of Eve and your dad to hold this against you and try to make you feel things that you won't feel. They don't get to tell you how to feel. I'm sorry that their carrying on basically forced you to spill a truth you knew would likely upset them, but it's their own fault for thinking of themselves and their little world and not thinking of how you were obviously grieving -- they're holding a completely 100% understandable reaction (for any human, not just a child) who lost a parent against you), which is especially terrible since you were a young child and yes, your life had been turned upside down.", "NTA and I desperately want this to be a creative writing exercise, because your dad and stepmom's selfishness is staggeringly cruel. \n\nThey're trying to rewrite history into a narrative they find complimentary to them, with no thought to how it twists a knife in your heart every time.

No way I can see any child wanting to attend a wedding in such circumstances. You're grieving a loss way too soon for that age of such an essential person.
