He\u2019s truly a gem & I don\u2019t want to lose him.  Even wearing leopard print pj\u2019s, a pink fuzzy sweater & a coat meant for dog sledding, he still tells me how beautiful & precious I am. \n\nHis family is religious & he wasn\u2019t so much at first but I have noticed him taking an interest in Christianity (due to many recent losses within the family recently) which is completely fine with me! My family is also religious & I was also baptized & taken to church on Easter & what not.   Again I find the religion quite fascinating so I have no problem with him believing in it.  The problem is that I agreed to get married in a church with a priest (even if I don\u2019t believe in that) but as we talked now, he changed his mind & doesn\u2019t want me wearing red in a church because it\u2019s not white & it defeats the purpose..  he says it\u2019s compromising but I feel like I\u2019m already compromising by doing it in a church with a priest instead of at a barn or what not.  I even said (just to see) that I would wear white but no church or priest & he said no.\n\nI\u2019m at a loss to be honest.

I\u2019m a Catholic and he\u2019s being ridiculous. I believe wearing white on wedding days is a Victorian invention (Victoria being a Protestant - you can throw that at him). It\u2019s a custom, but it\u2019s not a meaningful one. Literally millions of Catholic weddings have been performed before that and none wore white.

If he\u2019s insisting in a church, then he can compromise and not police what you wear. \n\nAdditionally, I STRONGLY recommend you both have a conversation about religion and expectations regarding religion before you get married. Going to church, how you plan to raise your children and making decisions regarding children (baptism, teaching them religious values) etc. \n\nIf you are already facing this hurdle, you will face others. It\u2019s possible for a religious and non religious person to be together but you need to have an understanding of each other\u2019s expectations.", "NTA, you're already compromising on the setting and the actual contents of your wedding ceremony. There's no reason why you can't wear red. Not to mention there's a LOT of beforehand prep that goes into a Catholic wedding if you aren't already a confirmed member of the Catholic Church so (assuming you aren't Catholic) his request is going to be much more impactful on you than your choice of dress is on him.", "As I'm sure you know, in some cultures, red is an extremely popular color for wedding dresses.  Catholic churches require that wedding dresses be somewhat modest, but do not regulate the color at all, so your red dress would not be forbidden.  \n\nSo how does the color of your dress \"defeat the purpose\"?  Isn't the purpose that you're getting married and placating him by doing so in his church despite the fact that you're not really a believer?\n\nI think you need to sit down with him and have some long conversations.  If he tries to control you and what you wear in general, or thinks he has a right to do so, you've got a real problem that's bigger than what color you get married in.\n\nNTA", "I guarantee the Church will care less about the color of your dress. They do however require that you attend their religious marital classes before you can be married in the Church. Have you really thought this through?", "I got married in a Catholic Church attached to a theology school and my dress had red along the neckline, red embroidery on bottom in front and the corset back ties and train were red. There was no issue with the church.", "NTA\n\nAs long as the priest is ok with the color cause sadly you have to follow the rules of that church, you can wear it!", "NTA.\n\nAnd DON'T marry someone who will try to force you to submit while calling it 'compromise'.", "OP wearing red in a church as the bride might get you a lot of weird looks from every religious guest, but that shouldn\u2019t be your concern.  Plus red is a great color on everyone.  I\u2019ve never seen anyone fail to look absolutely amazing in red.  Just make sure you go with as much of a natural red as you can.  Dark red is a no go.

If your partner's church does pre-Cana or a similar premarital counseling that would be a perfect time to ask. You can also call the church office and set up a meeting if you'd prefer to talk one on one. There's nothing in the Bible that specifies a white dress and off the top of my head I can't think of any churches that specify white in their doctrine.

What you posted is part of the marriage process unfortunately.", "The Queen was Victoria, and she wore white in 1840 to her wedding to Albert. Her dress was made of English lace in an attempt to make it fashionable again so that young women from noble and wealthy families would look to copy the young queen, revitalizing the English lace industry.", "Prior to that, wedding dresses were traditional black, the color of funerals. Poetic somehow.", "Rather unorthodox too.", "Interesting in light of those religions who use black clothing for religious and everyday wear (Orthodox and Amish for example).", "That was partially because most people couldn't afford a big wardrobe, and you needed a black dress to wear while you were in mourning -- because inevitably you were going to lose family members on both sides in the course of your marriage, and mourning was taken seriously. That's why Laura Ingalls Wilder sewed a black dress for her trousseau. If your mourning dress was your *best* dress, because it was meant for long use so made with care and quality materials, that's what you wore at the altar.", "Interesting. Makes sense."]}
