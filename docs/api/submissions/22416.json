Now I either hide them or I told him if he eats them all he has to buy me a new pack cause guess what buddy, now you\u2019re paying for them. It was the same way with my little sister when I was living at home. I ended up putting my name on my stuff and made her buy me more to make up for the stuff she ate. Just because you don\u2019t eat something as fast as everyone else doesnt mean you should have to lose out or feel like you\u2019re forced to eat them as quickly as everyone else.
