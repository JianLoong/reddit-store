Your mom sounds like she plays favourites and is teaching your sister some very unhealthy entitlement issues. Unfortunately, your options are limited if you are underage.

I\u2019ll buy a pack of cookies or something and let my bf (who\u2019s a big sugar fan) know their mine but he can still have a few. 99% of the time that turns into him demolishing the whole box in a whole day. Now I either hide them or I told him if he eats them all he has to buy me a new pack cause guess what buddy, now you\u2019re paying for them. It was the same way with my little sister when I was living at home. I ended up putting my name on my stuff and made her buy me more to make up for the stuff she ate. Just because you don\u2019t eat something as fast as everyone else doesnt mean you should have to lose out or feel like you\u2019re forced to eat them as quickly as everyone else.
