She finished her portion and then decided to eat your portion. Your mom was unfair with her \"What is she supposed to do? Watch you eat?\" comment. She ate all of hers already, and she doesn't have to watch you eat your ice cream, she can go do something else.

Your mom sounds like she plays favourites and is teaching your sister some very unhealthy entitlement issues. Unfortunately, your options are limited if you are underage.
