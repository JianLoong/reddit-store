As long as there's ice cream available most of the time, who cares if different people eat different amounts?", "But ownership means nothing to this girl.  She ate his share.  She'll eat what he buys too.  She's going to be a nightmare in college.  OP, tell your mother your sister is going to be hated by her roommates if she keeps this food-stealing up.  Just letting it go and establishing no limits is doing her no favors.", "Thank you for being a reasonable human.", "I mean, there were 2 so I think what they wanted was for OP and sister to both get one", "Lol if OP is a teenager then his parents are definitely not boomers. Maybe millennials even.", "NTA\n\nSometimes people are just difficult to deal with. My stepdad's mom used to make these little ginger snap cookies that were delicious. She would make them at holidays. One thanksgiving she gave me a gallon bag half full of them that were left over.

Couldn't you spend the energy it takes to make this post and go and buy your own box?", "You mentioned the ice cream is for the family and I\u2019ll assume you didn\u2019t buy them as that wasn\u2019t mentioned. Although you\u2019re technically accurate it isn\u2019t realistic to police everyone\u2019s portion. Sometimes you get more sometimes less but is one ice cream bar the hill you want to die on? Someday you might want a second doughnut, another piece of chicken or slice of pie and will be frustrated when your sister cuts you off because you\u2019re eaten your \u201cfair share\u201d. \nP.s. it\u2019s still petty if you bought them but slightly more understandable", "NTA.

And i understand you don't wanna do it (since its not healthy in any aspect)\n\nI came up with two solutions:\n\nA. When you buy the icecreams write the names of the owner of each icecream in the little package. Agree that you can't take the other's icecream and if someone does there will be a fine chosed by the icecream owner.\n\nB. Buy some kind of minifridge or something that can keep the icecreams cool. I recomend it to hide it or camuflage it in your bedroom and take the icecreams there. If needed keep it locked.", "NTA. Ice cream isn't sustenance, it's a treat.

Mother and sister are the AH.\n\nBut I have the strong feeling, you don't share the whole Informationen.

Yeah NTA", "Or if you don\u2019t want to eat all yours In one go maybe hide them behind other things in the freezer.\n\nNTA- you agreed to split the box evenly they ate all theirs too quick- not your fault.

Really? :shocked pikachu face:", "But they previosly agreed to share equally - 5 pieces each. There's OP's problem.\n\nI fully understand OP.

But I can't take all the credit, Futurama coined it first!", "How is OP an AH? Because she wanted her ice cream that was promised to her and then taken from her by her little sister?", "Is this what Reddit has come to?

This is children arguing over sacks. Quiet down.", "NTA. Looking forward to something and seeing someone else took it sucks. I still remember when I was 15 and bought sushi with my own pocket money and put it in the fridge to enjoy later that day as a reward to myself (cant remember what for) Well time came for some me time. So i put on a movie and went to get the sushi and half of it was gone. Only some kappa maki left as well while i was really looking forward to the big salmon and tuna ones. My mom would never take my food so I went to my dad about it quite upset. His response \"God you are such a spoiled only child. Learn how to share\" I would have gladly have him taste if he asked, but he just took it without asking. My mom now hides food around him, because he still does this even when he knows certain groceries are for a party later that week. It sucks having to live like that.", "NTA.

So entitled.", "NTA I can relate as I had the same thing happen my whole life.
