I was 3 minutes down the street from my house. The road to my house is a 2 lane, narrow street. However, there are sidewalks, and next to this street is a LARGE field with a walking trail full of grass that you usually see people working out on, so it\u2019s not as if you\u2019re not supposed to step on the grass, as that is it\u2019s intended purpose.\n\nI\u2019m driving down the street and there are 2 people, a couple presumably walking their small dog. That\u2019s fine. What isn\u2019t fine is the fact that they\u2019re walking side by side, in the MIDDLE of the fucking street. The left side had 3 oncoming vehicles so it\u2019s not like I could\u2019ve just drove on the opposite side to pass them. What pissed me off the most wasn\u2019t the fact they were walking and blocking the entire side the street I was driving on, but it was their demeanor. I\u2019m usually more than courtesy when it comes to pedestrians as well, I always drive slow around them, I let them cross when they need to, etc. And usually pedestrians (at least people with manners) see a car, and they move out of the way, they hurry up and jog across, or they walk in a single file line with their party until the car passes. But instead, they were staring into my car as if they wanted me to do something, and the guy preceded to nearly brush his fucking shoulder against my car. The fuck? Again, there is a side walk (which was empty) and a BUNCH of grass that is accessible for any one to use.\n\nThere was no way for me to pass them without completely stopping, as i\u2019ve already slowed down considerably in hopes they\u2019d move out of the way and the near shoulder brush of my car and attitude stare pissed me off, so i sped up and swerved around them. After that, looking into my rear view mirror, they proceeded to stare at me as if I\u2019m the one in the wrong. I believe I was more than patient with slowing down, hoping they moved out of the way even in the slightest sense like most normal people do (everyone in my neighborhood, and realistically\u2026 anywhere i\u2019ve encountered before this has done this) so I can pass and and hurry my sickly ass back home.

Well they succeeded. Hope you enjoyed your pass and that you feel better soon.", "There\u2019s no conflict? Also, how does the guy nearly brush his shoulder against your car unless you are up right beside them?", "INFO: This story doesn't make sense the way you've written it. How did he brush his shoulder against your car? How did you drive around them if there was too much traffic in the oncoming lane and the road is too narrow to drive around them because they were taking up the whole lane?", "There isn\u2019t even a conflict here. You did nothing wrong by going around them, and you have absolutely no proof that they were upset that you did. Staring at your car as you passed isn\u2019t indicative of anything, and even if they were bothered by it, who cares?", "NTA but it sounds like they were looking for a fight. If this is something they regularly do maybe try to get a video of them and report them for jaywalking if that\u2019s a thing where you are. Not only does it sound obnoxious for them to be walking in the street instead of the side walk when there\u2019s traffic but it doesn\u2019t sound safe", "NTA\n\nbut i prefer clear communication in instances like this.  I would have rolled my window down and said, \"Hey guys, I have to get home, any chance you can not walk in the middle of the street so I can drive by?\"  \n\nIn any event, as long as no one was in any danger, communicating your disapproval by squealing around them is too passive aggressive for my tastes, but I wouldn't call you an AH for it in this situation", "Hard to judge. They shouldn\u2019t be in the middle of the street, but if you drove and brushed his shoulder you were pretty close. If you ran over his foot being in pain or annoyed wouldn\u2019t matter to the cops.", "However wrong they were, it sounds like you did something dangerous. My judgement is poor when i have migraines.

Your 'shoulder brush' could have easily been an injury. I feel for your migraine, really i do, but fuck your using that as an excuse for threatening someone with your car.  Use your words like an adult. \n\nEveryone needs to be a little more conscientious.", "YTA\n\nYour actions could have caused death or accident.
