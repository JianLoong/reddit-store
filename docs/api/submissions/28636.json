We\u2019ve been together for 4 years, married for 2.\n\nWe were at a small house party with a few friends of mine from college and we were discussing books we\u2019ve all read, when at one point one of my friends (let\u2019s call him Steve) asks Will, \u201cSo Will, what\u2019s your favorite book?\u201d and my husband responds, \u201cOh, I really like To Kill A Mockingbird.\u201d Then Steve gives him a quizzical look and asks him, \u201cHave you read any books outside of high school?\u201d and Will hesitates a bit and says, \u201cOutside of manuals at work, I guess I haven\u2019t.\u201d So then I try to explain to Steve, \u201cOh yeah, he\u2019s not well educated, so he\u2019s never had a reason to be well read.\u201d We all had a good laugh, but then Will didn\u2019t really contribute a whole lot to the conversation the rest of the night. \n\nOn the car ride back, Will was pretty quiet. I ask if he\u2019s fine and all he says in a sarcastic tone is, \u201cPeachy.\u201d I ask him if I did anything to upset him and he responds back with, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m educated enough to properly explain myself.\u201d I tell him I didn\u2019t tell my friends that he was unintelligent, just that he wasn\u2019t college educated. He accused me of minimizing how hard his Navy schooling was, but I explained that military education and college education are simply not the same. We continued to fight until we got home. I texted my sister about what happened and she called me a huge asshole and that I need to apologize and now I\u2019m having second thoughts about how I handled this.

That is never ok. EVER!!!\n\nLet's circle back to the job... do understand what it takes to get onto a nuke sub??? These folks go through extensive testing to be even considered. Then they go through even more extensive training and education. These people are super smart. Their job is insanely stressful. \n\nI know two guys who were on nuclear subs. Two of the smartest people I know.  \n\nNot reading fiction doesn't equal being \"uneducated.\" Not everyone likes fiction. Also, maybe he read that book in high school and it really stuck with him. There is a book I read in high school which, many decades later, remains one of my absolute favorite books....I read a LOT of books. \n\nIt was so incredibly rude of your friend to make fun of your husband about his book choice.

YTA, and a huge one.  Are you sure someone as educated and well-read as you are should even be married to someone as stupid and illiterate as your NUCLEAR ENGINEER husband?? /s. \n\nUnbelievable that you are so clueless about your obvious disdain for your husband.  Let me tell you, OP - Bubbleheads (submariners) are some of the smartest and best trained people in the Navy.  They are more highly trained, more educated, and they go through rigorous screening and testing just to be considered for submarine duty.  You are married to someone who is probably smarter than YOU.  And you dare look down on him?  Shame on you.", "Holy shit use your educational plethora of knowledge to reflect on human decency.\n\nYou were demeaning so was your friend with the quizzicle,you not even realizing that puts up the question if your emotional maturing process halted in college.\n\nYes you owe him an apology and if you think just because someone isn't engaged in literature it means they are uneducated then you are shallow.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nHe works with nuclear reactors! That's highly demanding work, with no margin of error.  I'll take a college education any day over that level of life-and-death responsibility for not just myself but anyone in fallout range.  He's responsible for making sure that we don't have a repeat of Chernobyl in our nuclear equipment. \n\nHeck, it puts him in the same class as Jimmy Carter, quite possibly the most ***badass*** president of the 20th century.  In his long career, not only was he president, he also worked on nuclear reactors in the navy, and, with his team, literally walked into a melting-down reactor and fixed it.  Eradicated the Guinea Worm, a really nasty parasitic disease.  Negotiated peace between Egypt and Israel.  Built houses by hand for the poor, as a retirement project. Taught Sunday School for over half a century.\n\nWith work that demanding, it isn't surprising if your husband wants his relaxation time to not involve reading, if he's having to keep up with reading (and possibly working to keep updated) the safety and operation manuals for nuclear reactors. \n\nYou owe him an apology, and it wouldn't hurt for you to learn more about the (non-classified) parts of his responsibilities, so you don't make a fool of yourself downplaying his education, intellect and level of responsibility again.", "YTA - That was a really terrible thing to say about your partner to other people, especially in front of him. JFC he works on 'he works on nuclear reactors on submarines'. You should have stood up for him and told Steve that To Kill A Mockingbird was a great book for someone to like.\n\nDifferent people have different things they are better at or well-versed at. To put someone down for not being a book reader is super crappy.  \n\n\nEdit: I read it a few more times and I am just more horrified as I read it. Your emotional intelligence is sorely lacking.", "YTA- why would you need to throw out there that your husband isn't educated? That seems very belittling and unnecessary to the convo. You could have just said \"my husband enjoys doing other things besides reading\" and tried to include your husband, not separate him even more...", "YTA. Not everyone reads novels for fun and it has absolutely nothing to do with how smart they are or how much education they\u2019ve had. \u201cWell-read\u201d is not a character trait and it doesn\u2019t mean anything. \n\nTo be clear, you\u2019re a jerk and a snob, but so are your friends. Steve was also incredibly rude for asking that snotty question about reading any other books since high school. If you and Steve are representative of your whole friend group I\u2019m surprised your husband is even invited to your snooty parties. \n\nA book-based college education is only *one type* of education. It\u2019s not any better than other types; it\u2019s just more expensive. Honestly, shame on you for being so disrespectful and judgmental of the person you supposedly love most. Will deserves a lot better than a partner who insults him in public.", "YTA, and also kind of dumb. He is educated, he went to school as part of his service. Yes, military education counts. A lot of people who go to college for something other than liberal education or the arts will also not read many fiction books. Most of my friends who are engineers, computer scientists, etc didn't read many fiction books during school.   \n\n\nA military education is a good education, he works on nuclear reactors on submarines.   \n\n\nNot everyone reads a lot of fiction, that doesn't mean they aren't well educated. He has the education of an engineer or an applied scientist, it sounds.", "YTA. You belittled your husband and laughed about it with your friends. It is possible to be an efficient reader with a high school education.", "YTA and so is your friend Steve.  Your comment wasn't even funny, you were just patting yourselves on the back because you think you're smarter than your husband.\n\nBeing well read or well educated does not equate with being smart or apparently kind in your case.  You could have used this situation as an opportunity to encourage your husband to read some of the books that you and your friends enjoy (because reading is a great hobby he might enjoy, not because he needs to be well read), but you decided to make him feel stupid instead.", "YTA I can\u2019t even fathom why a guy with that level of intelligence and clearance is with YOU because you seem dumber than a box of rocks. I have a military education (I went to the US Air Force Academy) and a Masters degree - you, my dear, are an ASSHAT DEPENDENT of the highest degree. The amount of training, education, and security clearance your husband has is impressive and way beyond your comprehension\u2026obviously. You and your little band of snotty college friends need to fuck right off to the hole you crawled out of and learn some basic manners. I hope your husband loses the sea anchor he\u2019s got chained to him right now\u2026shaped like you.", "YTA, what the fuck?\n\nI'm not \"well educated\" and I love to read. I know people with multiple degrees and have never picked up a book for fun. The two have nothing to do with eachother. You chose to put him down and call him stupid in front of your friends.", "An absolute, submarine size YTA, your husband should have definitely married someone smarter than you....", "You're a massive AH (YTA)!  If you think so little of him why are you with him?  Or better yet, why is he with you!!  You are such an absolute,  obtuse, snob! Why would you treat someone you supposedly love so poorly?!", "YTA.  Plenty of college educated people are stupid.  Case in point, this post.  Plenty of college students never read.  Having an education is not required to be well read.  They literally have nothing to do with each other unless you are an English major, in which case you are stupid for spending so much on a useless degree instead of something STEM like engineering or materials or energy like nuclear power.\n\nDo you truly not understand how little you respect your husband?  You insulted him in front of your friends and then doubled down on how right you were to do so.  He IS LESS than you and your friends and it is apparently very important to you that he acknowledge his shortcomings in the light of your brilliance.", "YTA\n\nAnd quite elitist. You insulted your husband. The man defends our country and works on nuclear reactors, but he's not good enough for you and your friends.\n\nAnd he is very well educated. Again, could you fix a nuclear reactor? I didn't think so.", "YTA. You're horrible. You better apologize, then apologize again. And maybe he will forgive. I don't know if I could stay with someone who thinks less of me because I wasn't a book nerd.", "YTA\n\nA college education doesn't teach common sense. I hate you already, figuratively, not literally.", "Do you always put your husband down to make yourself feel better? What you do for work? Is it more complicated than nuclear reactors? Imagine being married to someone like you, just awful. YTA", "You basically called him a rube in front of friends. The man can answer for himself.\n\nYTA", "YTA-He may not be strongly academically inclined like you and the snobby assholes you chose to associate with but he\u2019s very well educated.", "YTA most definitely. Regardless of your intent, your delivery was elitist and snobby. Clearly your friends felt that his lack of interest in reading translates to a lack of intelligence and instead of shoring up your hubby you torpedoed him. That's a terrible thing to do to anyone, let alone your husband. There's all kinds of intelligence in the world and alot of it doesn't come from books.", "And to add, I bet you love throwing around the you are a navy wife and enjoy all the benefits both real and perceived, of his service while simultaneously bashing his lack of college education makes you major AH.", "Why the fuck do you need an education to read for pleasure anyway? Although, sounds like you and your friend read as some kind of struggle to see who\u2019s dick is biggest. \n\nI\u2019ve loved to read for all of my life, didn\u2019t need an education to take pleasure in books. Many of my smart friends don\u2019t read novels.

Your husband deserves better.  If you are capable, you should apologize.  At least your sister is educated enough to know this.", "YTA. Your husband works on nuclear reactors. Are you and your friends capable of doing it? Have your books prepared you for it? Being a bookworm (I am one) doesn't mean being educated. \n\nWhat you said was insulting and condescending. You could have simply said that given that he has to read manuals for work, he enjoys doing other stuff in his free time.", "YTA. \"Well educated\" and \"well read\" are not synonymous, and \"not well educated\" is generally considered an insult.", "YTA and that was mean. You are implying that you are better than him, which is untrue.\n\nI don't read literature because I'm not interested in it. I have a Masters degree. So guess what, you can have a college education and still not be well read. Stop being snobby.", "YTA. Your comments to your friends would have devastated me if I were in his shoes. I\u2019m really surprised none of your friends ever took you aside or contacted you privately to tell you this.", "YTA, I have 3 degrees and I certainly could not work on a nuclear reactor. Your husband has an incredibly difficult and complex job that required extensive training and education. That he does not read for pleasure and that he does not have a traditional 4 year degree does not make him uneducated. You are a terrible snob.

Homer Simpson may have you thinking too lowly of nuclear reactor technicians/engineers/workers. Maybe you meant \"well-read\"? And even then, manuals and textbooks still make a person well-read, having read a lot of books and learned a lot from them (like from...textbooks and technical manuals, usually very information dense).

This isn't just a YTA, moment.  This could be the moment you killed the relationship.", "Right? I have a PhD in chemistry and I rarely read books for fun. I read enough journal articles, app notes, emails...I just don't like to read anymore. Maybe one book a year at best. I'd rather use my limited free time on other things. Or maybe I'm just uneducated in disguise according to OP?", "I used to read voraciously as a kid but now I don\u2019t read as much. I didn\u2019t lose the smarts I already had just because I read less. We\u2019re always learning in life and the way people learn might look different for each person and that\u2019s okay. OP is rude and probably mad because her husband is smarter than her.", "\u201cShe has messed with how he thinks she thinks of him\u201d Exactly. You and Steve are the AH, OP", "Right? How, as a spouse or significant other, can a person move past not just being considered \"uneducated\" but because of that considered \"less than\" your SO and their friends?\n\nThe only appropriate response to Steve should have been, \"yeah he hasn't had tons of time for reading while he's staying up to date on keeping a whole ass nuclear reactor in working order while hundreds of miles under the ocean\"", "This is so true.\n\nI'm a bookworm, have over 300 books at home that I've read and I wouldn't call myself smart or \"well-read\" just because I've read them all. I can pretty much guarantee that her husband is smarter than me.", "OP is one of those who think they are \"special\" and smarter than most people since she went to college. What she doesn't want to recognize is that there are different types of intelligence. \n\nIMO...her husband was a lot \"smarter\" (not to mention very brave) to enter the military and have his education paid for while defending his country.\n\nNow that he knows how OP feels, and knows that she is super embarrassed by him in front of her friends I can't see this relationship ever being the same.    OP, YTA!", "At some point we as a society decided that reading equals smart. And that is NOT true. How many adults with degrees and all do not read. How many of them are dumb? A lot is the answer. The OP seems like one of those snobbish people, bc she went to college and judge those who didn't.", "I don\u2019t think my brother has ever read a work of fiction that wasn\u2019t assigned by a teacher; he just doesn\u2019t care for reading. He\u2019s also a brilliant mechanical engineer who made ridiculous money on government contracts barely out of college. Meanwhile, my bookworm self didn\u2019t even finish college.", "This \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffe. FFS! I guess being college educated means you don\u2019t have to have any sort of emotional intelligence or awareness in this case. WTF op? Huge YTA!", "It\u2019s crazy that she\u2019s isn\u2019t sure if she\u2019s the AH here. So let me understand- you and another man are getting a groups of your friends to laugh at your husbands life work. Wtf? Lady If he put pictures up of women who were more fit and better looking than you and then laughed at you with his friends (and a beautiful, fit female friend) as needing to work harder at the gym it would probably be close to how you made him feel.", "Yep....\ud83e\udd14. OP open the door to lack of trust with her disrespect. Planted a seed by Back burner Steve....", "And OP allowed it. To be stabbed in the back by your own partner, ouch.\nCheating is Not the only betrayal. \nThe Respect and Trust in this relationship just got torpedoed.", "Cause she's an AH? I expect OP will end up deleting this post. This is one of the few times where everyone unanimously agrees, YTA.\n\nDoing this to anyone, especially a spouse, huge AH belittling people.", "I love trashy books! They\u2019re such a fun escape from reality!", "Personally I adore it. Comes with the vagina.", "Lol", "**Very mild, innocuous teasing** in public or private is generally OK. (Example: my husband loves sweets so I call him the cookie monster occasionally with friends/family, knowing it won't stop him from grabbing a cookie or make him feel bad about himself.) But this is such harsh criticism, and in public. I feel like, especially in public, you should be your spouse's biggest hype-person.", "\"Gender studies\" -- predominantly cis people trying to explain trans people to each other and failing.", "Exactly this. I transferred around 80 credits when I got out towards a four year engineering degree. All from the Navy nuclear program. The only reason it wasn't closer to 90 was a cap on transfer credits for the school.", "Yeah, my dad only needed one semester worth of college to finish a degree in nuclear engineering once he was getting out.", "I appreciate this! I dodge the groups like a plague, because of women like OP. Maaan. Come to the dark side. We have cookies, a crockpot going, and a bunch of puppies. <3", "Way back in the 90's my wife took a military aptitude test and this role is what she was recommended for. She's smart as hell despite not getting a college degree.", "My favorite book ever? *Frog and Toad Are Friends.* Have I read other books? Yes.  Many. But that's still my favorite, and I was an English major. And both that and *To Kill a Mockingbird* are probably, hands down, better than any \"educated\" garbage that Steve-hole considers his favorite.", "What a great comeback in the car on the way home though heh? \u201cNot educated enough to explain\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 nailed it", "Let them try to laugh when they talk to electricians and other trades people who doubled their salaries after covid", "Well damn like seriously, it doesn\u2019t take a clever person to say something on the spot that could show some pride in his work other than jumping straight to \u201che\u2019s not well educated\u201d. \n\nYou want to believe it was a mistake but she very obviously is embarrassed at some level which made her say something even more embarrassing. I just can\u2019t believe that\u2019s the only thing miss smarty pants could think of saying.", "I know a lot of Navy people..  older vets, younger vets and newly out vets.  There are times the LAST thing they want to do is read.  You are 10000% correct.. Outside and fresh air.  From flat tops or subs or everything in between.  There are older and younger vets who don't travel.. they've seen it all and would rather stay home.  I also know a vet with over 700 books at home and hasn't cracked one in 10 years.", "Same. I read **a lot** of books. I used to get in trouble for reading so much in school, I have a library with over 1500 books, all of which I've read, and I read at least 100 books a year on my Kindle. TKAM is definitely in my top five, as is Fahrenheit 451, both standard \"high school curriculum\" books.\n\nMaybe they're considered literary classics because they're just *that fucking good*.", "I actually reread TKAMB in a college literature class. I know like every HS kid reads it, but they're by no means the only people who have read it ffs.\n\nEven so, one of my favorite books of all time, which I've reread *several* times as an adult, is A Wrinkle in Time (and its sequels). I don't care how educated I am - that will never not be one of my favorites.", "Yes! Honestly, I wouldn't even get to asking him about books, I'd be too busy going *tell me more about your fascinating job*.", "Steve's a pretentious dick but OP is worse. Instead of supporting their partner OP said a man who works on a fucking nuclear submarine is uneducated \n\nI'm a college educated engineer who is a safety manager on NYC high rise construction sites who happens to be a voracious reader and I'm amazed by the people who are willing to work with nuclear power on a fucking submarine. I mean, underwater with no place to escape on a nuclear vessel? No Thank You \n\nOP-no one gives a fuck that a person's favorite book is the latest Ken Follett or Stephen King book on the best seller list. You should be proud that your husband is smart, honorable, brave and comes home to you every day.", "[removed]", "And yes, YTA.", "For real! I devour books, but like... I'm reading about a house on chicken legs and the people who live in it. At least what he's reading has real world applications lol.", "What are the titles to these romance witches?? I just got off a kick of werewolf \u201cromance\u201d novels lol", "Can confirm as prior navy, those manuals are completely dry and a slog to read through", "The thing is, one of the best things we can learn from reading fiction is how to understand and empathize with other people (which, ideally, is something people could learn from this sub--I know, call me crazy). She and her friends have no capacity for that. All they learned in college was how to name drop book titles.", "Wish I could like this a thousand times. Yes, it\u2019s about respect.", "Right, I would seriously be contemplating divorce if I found out this was what my spouse really thought about me.", "She's not counting all the technical reading that's getting done for you and her husband.  You both read an incredible amount. It's just not English class literature.", ">I guess being college educated means you don\u2019t have to have any sort of emotional intelligence or awareness in this case.\n\nI work with Uni students and professors 5 days a week, 9 hours a day and nothing could be closer to the truth! Some of the smartest professors I've ever had the pleasure of meeting are just as dumb and subtle as a bag of hammers outside of their very specialized field.", "One of my pet peeves is people not recognizing that the US military has a higher educational average than the rest of the country - you have to have at *least* a GED, and even that is rare, only a couple percent of people. Everyone else has at least a high school diploma, and every officer has a four year degree. There are some real mouthbreathers still, but when I was a tanker on the M1 Abrams, I also worked alongside some of the smartest people I've ever met.", "Yup i know a few elitist people like this. Honestly I\u2019m shocked OP married someone in the military with that view on their chosen career. I guarantee his education to work on a nuclear submarine is at least equal to, if not harder than, whatever college they did. \n\nMy favorite is Ender\u2019s Game. Loved it at 10 and have loved it at all ages I\u2019ve re-read it since then!", "I still love To Kill a Mockingbird, it's an incredible book.", "And during the period of time those became standard HS fare, they had the kids read actual literature.", "Same. Ironically I've also been referred to as book smart but naive as a younger adult. I'm more than sure the nuclear sub guy would be alot more help via his education in a simple crisis!", "after her comment i might re asses comming home to her though. \n\nHUGE YTA IMO", "TKAM voted the book of the century.
