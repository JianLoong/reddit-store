Seriously not your job.  \nYour ex sucks for not apologizing when he ought to have.  \nYou suck for sharing that video which you should have kept to yourself if you were going to keep it at all.   \n\n\nSo yeah, ESH. Why would you want to respond, anyway?", "The very fact that brother knows J would be angry to find out you recorded it proves that everyone knows J didn't intend to apologize and certainly didn't mean a word of it. I'm queen petty...so I'd send it to J just to get under his skin. I'm assuming J knew you recorded it at the time and didn't complain...so oh well. NTA because if he had got violent you might have needed proof, so recording him was actually the smart thing to do.", "NTA. Sometimes in situations like that you need the proof. But you need to not keep going back to check on him because he is manipulating you. His addiction is not yours to manage and you can't save him from himself by showing up.", "ESH.  Your ex sounds bad, yelling at you and trying to fix that with gifts is not okay.  Your brothers aren't great either, they should never have asked you to go check on your ex.  Filming someone who is drunk without their permission is also a crappy thing to do, unless they are committing a crime, which he wasn't.", "ESH. Julien needs to grow up, your brothers need to butt out of your dating life, and you need to raise your standards. Also, this probably goes without saying, but don't record people without their consent, and definitely don't go blabbing to your busybody brothers about it if you do.", "NTA but just be done with him already.

And I dont understand all these y t a comments. Apparently you're just supposed to let your brothers and your ex gaslight you. But getting proof makes you the bad guy? Like, tell me you've never been in a relationship with an abusive manipulator without telling me you've never been in a relationship with an abusive manipulator.\n\nYou really need to get out of these people's orbit tho. None of these men have your back. They're all bros with each other more than they're actual siblings/a partner to you.", "ESH he sucks for being a sucky individual and how he treated you. You suck because you recorded him in a state and showed it other people, which is definitely not cool.", "NTA. You have proof that you did nothing bad to him, or say anything bad\u2026 only that you checked on him out of concern", "Kinda ESH. Filming someone without their consent and then showing it to people is kinda messed up. It would be one thing if you did it because he committed a crime. But it wasn\u2019t a crime so filming it wasn\u2019t necessary", "NTA.  This guy seems like he's got a habit of gaslighting you so you probably did the right thing.  But what's up with your brother?  They recommend you deleting it and then one of them goes off and tattles on his own sister?", "Why did you need to record him? YTA because that sounds petty.", "Not enough info on the situation, why did you even record the conversation to begin with ?", "NTA if you don't show it to anyone else. Don't make it public, and I would watch once or twice and then delete to let go.\n\nNOW. Don't take him back. I'm sure he will say \"well you have my apology recorded so we should get back together\".", "YTA.\n\nIt sounds like you recorded your ex and shared it without his knowledge or consent. In most places, this would be considered illegal. Even if you believe that he had wronged you, sharing his recordings without his consent is not an acceptable way to handle the situation. You are in the wrong for doing this, and you should delete the recording immediately. It is not worth risking legal trouble or further damaging your relationship with your ex.", "YTA you recorded someone under the influence, aka you can't get their permission to record. You were also at his place making it his property so I don't think legally you were in the right.\n\nThat aside It depends I'd say your an asshole because you recorded this to hang over his head, kinda like a haha I got your hat(you apologizing)", "ESH. He sucks for obvious reasons and you suck for recording a drunk man without his consent and doubling down on it.", "Yes thats an asshole move", "ESH. Depending on where you live, recording him might be a straight up crime.", "NTA. Recording him apologizing isn\u2019t wrong. Showing said video to people isn\u2019t wrong. He threw your relationship away because he wouldn\u2019t apologize and then finally did, the only reason he could be mad is if he didn\u2019t mean it in which case it\u2019s even better that you have it because now there proof that he knew he was an asshole who needed to apologize.", "I don't think YTA but if you just want him to see that he actually apologized then you should delete it afterwards. It depends on what the person you recorded wants because I think there should be consent when doing things like that cuz he was drunk...\n\nYTA if you showed it to other ppl apart from ur brothers...", "NTA  \nYou are keeping it for you, he was wrong & now you can fully walk away & forget about him. No more checking up on him.\n\nPS your middle brother is a little shit.", "YTA.  Definitely delete it.  Be honest, you didn't record it for any of the reasons you mention, you just thought it was funny.", "**NTA** for now but you seriously need to stop getting involved. Block him on everything and walk away. Heck, I think you should even delete the recording - you have proven your point, so stop.", "NTA", "Yta\n\nYou shouldn't have recorded him. You did this in bad faith. Also, record him for what? Just because he apologised and you wanted proof for whatever bs reason? Sorry but thats so messed up on so many levels, you had no good intentions when recording him. Who cares if he apologised or not? It's *over*. You *broke up*.
