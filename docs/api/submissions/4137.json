Why would you want to respond, anyway?", "The very fact that brother knows J would be angry to find out you recorded it proves that everyone knows J didn't intend to apologize and certainly didn't mean a word of it. I'm queen petty...so I'd send it to J just to get under his skin. I'm assuming J knew you recorded it at the time and didn't complain...so oh well. NTA because if he had got violent you might have needed proof, so recording him was actually the smart thing to do.", "NTA. Sometimes in situations like that you need the proof. But you need to not keep going back to check on him because he is manipulating you. His addiction is not yours to manage and you can't save him from himself by showing up.", "ESH.  Your ex sounds bad, yelling at you and trying to fix that with gifts is not okay.  Your brothers aren't great either, they should never have asked you to go check on your ex.  Filming someone who is drunk without their permission is also a crappy thing to do, unless they are committing a crime, which he wasn't.", "ESH.

Be honest, you didn't record it for any of the reasons you mention, you just thought it was funny.", "**NTA** for now but you seriously need to stop getting involved.

He embarrassed you in front of his friends and that was enough for your to call it quits.  Fair enough,  Your little tit-for-tat is pretty immature though.  \n\nVerdict: ESH", "Stupid sexy Julien", "So just to be clear you broke up with this person and had no contact. He did not ask you to go to his house or help him in any way. He treated you poorly in the relationship but it sounds like he respect the breakup. You then show up at his house unannounced. He asks you to leave, but instead of leaving, you start recording him? This sounds like a very clear YTA to me. No idea where the NTA comments are coming from.", "YTA\n\nDon\u2019t film someone if they\u2019re too drunk to consent. You guys broke up, just forget about him and move on. It\u2019s weird to film a drunk person who is so drunk that they don\u2019t even recognize they\u2019re being filmed", "Why would you record your ex drunk apologizing? That sounds almost creepy, and it is disrespect of privacy. Super weird.", "NTA. You know what you are dealing with & the mindsets of the people around you. You got the apology. It's time to cut him loose to handle his own issues. Don't respond. Don't engage. Just walk away - he's not your problem any more.", "I agree. I also don't understand people being so vengeful after a bad breakup.\n\nI've been cheated on. I didn't run out and destroy their stuff or newer relationships to get even. Just took care of myself and moved on.\n\nMy last ex had me so wrapped up it messed with my head. I had to keep notes of every action I did in the place to track what was real or not. I have bad memory and they always told me messes/damage was mine when it was them. When I called them out on it, they switched their story and actually convinced me it was my job to do all the cleaning and bill paying.  \nAfter my friends talked some sense into me and I ended things, it got messy. Not once did I ever consider recording them and showing other people or trying to get back at them for their actions. \n\nSome people suck. Sometimes it takes awhile to see. People need to just drop it and go.\n\nI will add the exceptions of getting back what's rightfully yours (stolen) and fighting lies from asshole exs. In those cases record away and get what you deserve!", "He told her to leave. She refused and started recording him. She's TA for that and he's TA for all the other shit she says he's done", "You recently recorded something that happened 10 years ago?", "\u201cAlso if you are in a public setting, you don\u2019t need consent \u2026\u201d\n\nThis is again, not completely true (at least in the United States). There are two party consent states that still don\u2019t allow audio recording without consent in public places. This is one of those topics that does NOT need \u201cgeneral, varies by location\u201d facts. \n\nThere absolutely ARE two part consent states that still protect privacy even in public places. On top of that, this is not just a federal or state thing, but you also have to look into your very local laws. Audio recordings are VERY tricky. You should not be getting in to this unless you know the particulars of the location. Otherwise you have no idea how far or close your advice is.\n\nThe problem with spouting this nonsense so generally is that the range of consequences for listening to your \u201cadvice\u201d span \u201ccompletely legal\u201d to \u201cviolation of local, state and/or federal wiretap laws\u201d. \n\nThat is a MAJOR spread of consequences, charges, and legalities.", "OP also stated it wasn't illegal in the thread you linked so why only use the portion of the thread that works for you??  Your argument was that what she did was illegal.  By her countries laws it was not so how would she be risking legal trouble??\n\nAs to further damaging her relationship with her ex - its her ex why should she care there is no relationship.\n\nThe irony is I agree with you that OP shouldn't have done it.  Why expend this kind of energy on an ex.  Easiest way to get back at them is to move on and be happy in your life and maybe happy in a relationship if that happens.  Besides who needs the drama.", "I will concede that consent while drunk is not the same. But it doesn't mean he didn't see her pull out her phone and start recording and be okay in the moment, just means he might have forgot", "This is absolutely not universally true (at least in the United States), and thinking it is can put people in some very bad situations. There are two party consent states where public audio recording/filming (edited for clarity: the audio during filming) is NOT legal and can be prosecuted under state wiretap laws. \n\nYou need to be very careful when recording, and you should only do so knowing the full extent of local and state laws, including how they differ from federal law.", "Interesting. I mean I work in a context where consent to record is a big big deal, and I\u2019d never just randomly record things. But this fact pattern seems extra concerning in this regard", ">I recorded it because I knew he would deny it when he was sober and it was nice hearing him say he was sorry for once.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame you can\u2019t read", ">say he was sorry for once. \n\nCrap I can\u2019t read", "I read that part.  That doesn't mean he has denied anything in the past.  He never apologized before.  \n\nBut, my piont is, why does she need to prove that he did that.  If the relationship is over, there is no point.", "Here's the statement: \"When I went to see him, he was drunk. At first, he was being a jerk and trying to kick me out but then he started apologising after I told him off.\"\n\nWow, I even had to get that for you...But anyways, it doesn't say whether he lives in an apartment, or if he tried to kick her off his property. It doesn't say he let her inside his home, but it also doesn't say she entered his home. It just says \"trying to kick me out\". And I've seen this with \"out of the building\", \"off his property\", etc., etc."]}
