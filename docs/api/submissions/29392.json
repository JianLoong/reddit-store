Why did you need to be included in the adoption as a sibling?", "Info:  is this just a hypothetical question or are one of the parents in question in ill health?  I ask because you don't just automatically get willed a child.  Social services gets involved and if you don't want to be a legal guardian, that's all you need to say.", "A child should never have to feel like they're just a burden on whomever is taking care of them.

It is her and Dan's mess and she needs to deal with it. OP I suggest you seek a legal expert to ensure mother does not go behind your back and name you as the kid's caregiver if something does happen to her. If anything is to happen to the kid's parents, by right Dan's family and/or Dan's late lover's family are the rightful caregivers to raise Matt", "NTA.

Taking care of kids is a LOT.\n\nNTA even a little.", "NTA, but your mother is also some what responsible for the emotional and psychological pain that you suffered by Dan. He wasn't yor father. So he wouldn't have been in your life if it wasn't for having a relationship with him.  She is your parent. Her responsiblility was to protect you. Not to continue to put you in a toxic environment because she wanted to be with someone who wasn't good for you or her. You need therapy.

There's not much point picking a fight over unlikely scenarios. \n\nEven if there was a realistic chance of that happening, surely there are other relatives who would be more interested? \n\nNTA for not wanting to be a parent though, and no child should be raised by someone who doesn't want to raise a kid. /R/childfree is a good sub.", "NTA, but you shouldn't seek out some therapy. You are extremely resentful of Matt for things he others did when raising him.  Matt has no control over how he was raised - that's all on your mom and Dan.", "YTA. Your adoptive brother is innocent in all of this. You have a duty to him.", "INFO: is either your mom or Dan in poor health?\n\nI mean, how old will they each be at the time Matt hits 18? Based on the numbers in the story, you're looking at your mom being maybe 70 and Dan being maybe 68.", "NTA. You don't want to, and a kid should go with people who want him. Depending on how old you'd be if this were to happen, you might not have the financial means.", "No", "My mother was expecting Matt and I to have a strong fraternal bond. I guess she wanted me to be his sister to ensure he wouldn't be alone. Since Matt was a toddler, he looked at me as his older sister. I might have been naive to accept to take part in the adoption a few years ago. I felt the obligation to do so.\n\nMy mother has a difficult relationship with her siblings. They hardly talk except during holidays, birthdays or important events. However I already have a half-sister on my father's side and we don't talk to each other at all so I don't understand why it would be different with Matt.", "It's a hypothetical question. I feel the need to be prepared for the future in case something like this actually occurs. His father has been dealing with some medical issues in the past.", "I'm currently working on this unhealthy relationship with my therapist. We've made some advances. In contrast to the past, I'm now able to see her toxic and controlling behaviours towards me and how they affect me. \nI haven't brought Matt's issue up during therapy yet as it's a painful topic for me but I'm planning to do so during our future sessions!", "Recently she started to talk about the future of our family if she passes away assuming I'd be taking care of Matt. She started to talk about where we should go, what I should be worrying about (Dan's side of the family is extremely chaotic and we can't stand to see each other) and making decisions about my future lifestyle without even asking.\nThis got me extremely stressed out and decided it would be best standing my grounds the last time she talked to me about this topic.", "No one has a duty to take care of a sibling.  That is on the parents.", "Why does she.\n\nHe's not even blood related . \n\nYes he's the inocent 1 in this but so is she.\n\nShe as even been sterilised that's how much she doesn't want children", "My mother will be 67 and Dan will be around 72.", "Can you remove yourself from any documents?", "Matt isn't  even a blood relative. He's step-dads affair baby. No responsibility at all. NTA", "I'm not sure. I've been struggling to get any real information about it from my mother. I live in Argentina and as far as I know I'm legally his sister. The legal implications are unknown to me. It might be best to look for advice from a lawyer."]}
