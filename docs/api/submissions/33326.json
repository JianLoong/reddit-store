While John and Brad are both good guys, Ethan is a bit more problematic. Ethan\u2019s greatest vice is probably the fact that he\u2019s a womanizer. He always has been and probably always will be.\n\nAcross the street from us, there\u2019s a house with a few girls from our college. Among them are two in particular (Ashley F20 and Rebecca F20) whom Ethan has set his sights on. Ashley and Rebecca were best friends as they\u2019ve known each other since grade school.\n\nSince September 2022, Rebecca has had a massive crush on Ethan. This was according to Ethan himself. I thought he was just bragging at the time, but when I paid attention to how she acted around him, it became pretty clear to me and the other guys that she did. Ethan, using his big brain, decided to start dating Ashley back in January. This did put some strain on Rebecca and Ashley's friendship, but they decided to work it out.\n\nFast forward to September, Ethan cheated on Ashley with Rebecca, which completely destroyed their friendship. This sucks since it was the start of the school year, and they have to share a house together. I\u2019m also good friends with both Ashley and Rebecca so this definitely put me in an awkward position as it along with everyone else in their social group. Ethan was then in a relationship with Rebecca until mid-November when he cheated on Rebecca with Ashley. This man literally claims he did this for \u201cequity\u2019s sake\u201d as he thought it would make them friends again somehow because they were now technically even.\n\nNow tonight, Ethan tells me and the guys that he started texting another girl from their house (Linda, F19). I\u2019ve never spoken to Ethan before about his relationships, but when he told us this, I said that he should probably leave those girls across the street \u201cthe hell alone.\u201d\n\nI told him that he was acting wild and was probably causing so much resentment inside that house. Ethan played this off and said that I was only saying this since I didn\u2019t have \u201chis game\u201d and that I was being disrespectful towards those girls by assuming they couldn\u2019t make smart decisions on their own. I told him that they couldn\u2019t make good decisions since he was probably feeding them lies, and the conversation sort of died down there.\n\nLater, Brad said that while I did bring up some valid points, I was sort of an asshole for how I said them. I feel pretty justified in what I said, but I\u2019m looking for a second opinion.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702950538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lpzju/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_to_leave_the_girls/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I told my roommate that he needed to leave the girls' across the street the \"hell alone\" and that he should probably not text the one girl anymore.\n2. My tone might have been perceived as very direct which was part of my intention. I also tried to interfere in this guy's relationships when I technically have no right. Also according to the guy, by interfering like this, I disrespected the girls by assuming they made dumb decisions\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The women across the street can make decisions, but so can Ethan, and he's choosing drama, dishonesty and attention-seeking. Going after the third woman in the house is *weird* and it has an impact on your life too - these are your neighbours and your friends. There's nothing wrong with calling him out on it, and the fact that he got defensive with suggesting you're jealous indicates you hit a nerve. I do think it might be worth a second conversation or more where he's less defensive, to ask him why he's making these weird choices, because he's not going to hear you when he's in that state. But speaking up is more important than you know, OP. There's good evidence that one of the big things that affects whether men are bad/harmful to women is what their peers have to say when it comes up and what the group norms are. It sounds like Ethan's having consensual if problematic/messy hookups with the women around him, but don't doubt your instinct to call out what you think is crappy behaviour, it can make a difference you'll never even know about. Sure, sex is great, but being a womanizer is a pretty stupid, empty thing for him to be proud of and if he's gonna do any growing in the next few years it's likely going to be with the help of more mature people around him.", "NTA - he brought this up to you, and you responded. Thats how conversations work. Youre not an AH for that", "NTA - Ethan is awful. The girls will learn eventually.", "NTA, Ethan is such an awful person messing with people's lives", "NTA but Ethan is for sure.", "Why not just tell the girls how he\u2019s been treating and thinking of them and then distance yourself from everyone.", "NTA, Ethan has centred his personality around treating women like conquests. He needs to be put in his place.", "NTA\n\nethan is TA for playing with those girls and with his personality he is for sure feeding them lies.", "NTA at all. honestly more guys should be like you. Ethan sounds like the type of guy girls warn each other about.", "One word describes Ethan: Predator. He deliberately set out to ruin a nearly lifelong friendship just for his amusement, then having done this continued to torment A & R, and now is targeting their other roommate to make life completely unbearable for both A & R plus the other girl. Charisma is often a trait of sociopathy, of course he's got game. \n\nHe's still young and this is just him toying around. Wonder what he will do next to amuse himself at the expense of other humans. With non conscience there's literally no limit. Maybe physically harming women... but not necessarily (edit: only women). There are all kinds of ways to torment people. Roommates can be good easy targets for him to practice on. He's already toying with *your* emotions, enjoying watching you cringe with each little evil detail he shared of his abuse of those girls. OP, watch out for this guy, he's truly evil. He could frame you right out of school without even giving it much thought. He may be capable eventually of inflicting truly huge harm on a missing-persons level. \n\nThe girls are caught up in their emotions and focused on day to day changes to Ethan's loyalties, assuming him to be a bit simple in these matters and that he's \"just not getting it\" - rather than a master manipulator playing them for fools. If A & R knew that Ethan was aware of R's crush, and had pointed it out to you with amusement long before he deliberately went for Ashley just to wreck their friendship, then switched their roles just to increase their pain and his amusement, they would be livid, and moreso to know that he has designs upon the other girl just to torment them both more. They're paying good money for college yet this guy's games must have them exhausted, angry and hurt to where studying must be difficult.\n\nEdit to add: NTA. But never confront him again, he'll either be amused as you fall into his traps, or perhaps angered which would be dangerous for you. I wish you would quietly tell all 3 girls how badly they've been used, and move yourself far away from this conscience-free man.", "NTA- I would have told Ethan to stop shitting where he eats and take his \"game\" further away from the street they all have to cohabitate.\n\nI would have noted that the only reason he's even into all 3 of those girls is convenience sake because he's too lazy to walk down to campus to be a lecherous pig.", "You are NTA. Ethan is a sociopath.", "NTA. Ethan has some serious brain issues. That fact he is getting pleasure out of destroying a friendship is rather concerning.", "NAH.

Btw, he's an immature sociopath. Just wait until he gets a little older....", "NTA. Ethan needed to hear some harsh words to even listen to you.  He obviously doesn\u2019t care who he hurts and what relationships he shreds.  Pretty sad for a human being. Ethan is definitely the as*hole.", "NTA, this guy is a shit and honestly anyone who is friends with him that doesn\u2019t call him out for being such a shit, is also a shit.\n\nI would consider focusing on other friendships with better people.", "NTA Ethan is an AH and a creep.
