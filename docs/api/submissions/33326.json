While John and Brad are both good guys, Ethan is a bit more problematic. Ethan\u2019s greatest vice is probably the fact that he\u2019s a womanizer. He always has been and probably always will be.\n\nAcross the street from us, there\u2019s a house with a few girls from our college. Among them are two in particular (Ashley F20 and Rebecca F20) whom Ethan has set his sights on. Ashley and Rebecca were best friends as they\u2019ve known each other since grade school.\n\nSince September 2022, Rebecca has had a massive crush on Ethan. This was according to Ethan himself. I thought he was just bragging at the time, but when I paid attention to how she acted around him, it became pretty clear to me and the other guys that she did. Ethan, using his big brain, decided to start dating Ashley back in January. This did put some strain on Rebecca and Ashley's friendship, but they decided to work it out.\n\nFast forward to September, Ethan cheated on Ashley with Rebecca, which completely destroyed their friendship. This sucks since it was the start of the school year, and they have to share a house together. I\u2019m also good friends with both Ashley and Rebecca so this definitely put me in an awkward position as it along with everyone else in their social group. Ethan was then in a relationship with Rebecca until mid-November when he cheated on Rebecca with Ashley. This man literally claims he did this for \u201cequity\u2019s sake\u201d as he thought it would make them friends again somehow because they were now technically even.\n\nNow tonight, Ethan tells me and the guys that he started texting another girl from their house (Linda, F19). I\u2019ve never spoken to Ethan before about his relationships, but when he told us this, I said that he should probably leave those girls across the street \u201cthe hell alone.\u201d\n\nI told him that he was acting wild and was probably causing so much resentment inside that house. Ethan played this off and said that I was only saying this since I didn\u2019t have \u201chis game\u201d and that I was being disrespectful towards those girls by assuming they couldn\u2019t make smart decisions on their own. I told him that they couldn\u2019t make good decisions since he was probably feeding them lies, and the conversation sort of died down there.\n\nLater, Brad said that while I did bring up some valid points, I was sort of an asshole for how I said them. I feel pretty justified in what I said, but I\u2019m looking for a second opinion.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702950538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lpzju/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_to_leave_the_girls/", "score": 437, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I told my roommate that he needed to leave the girls' across the street the \"hell alone\" and that he should probably not text the one girl anymore.\n2. My tone might have been perceived as very direct which was part of my intention. I also tried to interfere in this guy's relationships when I technically have no right.

The women across the street can make decisions, but so can Ethan, and he's choosing drama, dishonesty and attention-seeking. Going after the third woman in the house is *weird* and it has an impact on your life too - these are your neighbours and your friends. There's nothing wrong with calling him out on it, and the fact that he got defensive with suggesting you're jealous indicates you hit a nerve. I do think it might be worth a second conversation or more where he's less defensive, to ask him why he's making these weird choices, because he's not going to hear you when he's in that state. But speaking up is more important than you know, OP. There's good evidence that one of the big things that affects whether men are bad/harmful to women is what their peers have to say when it comes up and what the group norms are. It sounds like Ethan's having consensual if problematic/messy hookups with the women around him, but don't doubt your instinct to call out what you think is crappy behaviour, it can make a difference you'll never even know about. Sure, sex is great, but being a womanizer is a pretty stupid, empty thing for him to be proud of and if he's gonna do any growing in the next few years it's likely going to be with the help of more mature people around him.", "NTA - he brought this up to you, and you responded. Thats how conversations work. Youre not an AH for that", "NTA - Ethan is awful. The girls will learn eventually.", "NTA, Ethan is such an awful person messing with people's lives", "NTA but Ethan is for sure.", "Why not just tell the girls how he\u2019s been treating and thinking of them and then distance yourself from everyone.", "NTA, Ethan has centred his personality around treating women like conquests. He needs to be put in his place.", "NTA\n\nethan is TA for playing with those girls and with his personality he is for sure feeding them lies.", "NTA at all. honestly more guys should be like you. Ethan sounds like the type of guy girls warn each other about.", "One word describes Ethan: Predator. He deliberately set out to ruin a nearly lifelong friendship just for his amusement, then having done this continued to torment A & R, and now is targeting their other roommate to make life completely unbearable for both A & R plus the other girl. Charisma is often a trait of sociopathy, of course he's got game. \n\nHe's still young and this is just him toying around. Wonder what he will do next to amuse himself at the expense of other humans. With non conscience there's literally no limit. Maybe physically harming women... but not necessarily (edit: only women). There are all kinds of ways to torment people. Roommates can be good easy targets for him to practice on. He's already toying with *your* emotions, enjoying watching you cringe with each little evil detail he shared of his abuse of those girls. OP, watch out for this guy, he's truly evil. He could frame you right out of school without even giving it much thought. He may be capable eventually of inflicting truly huge harm on a missing-persons level. \n\nThe girls are caught up in their emotions and focused on day to day changes to Ethan's loyalties, assuming him to be a bit simple in these matters and that he's \"just not getting it\" - rather than a master manipulator playing them for fools. If A & R knew that Ethan was aware of R's crush, and had pointed it out to you with amusement long before he deliberately went for Ashley just to wreck their friendship, then switched their roles just to increase their pain and his amusement, they would be livid, and moreso to know that he has designs upon the other girl just to torment them both more. They're paying good money for college yet this guy's games must have them exhausted, angry and hurt to where studying must be difficult.\n\nEdit to add: NTA. But never confront him again, he'll either be amused as you fall into his traps, or perhaps angered which would be dangerous for you.

All of them are assholes", "NTA I'd go tell Linda that he was an absolute ass who knew exactly what he was doing and not to let crazy dip it's dick in her.", "Honestly the girls are idiots for liking and dating the dude, who is just like you said a womaniser. \n\nMustn\u2019t be the best of friends if they are willing to cheat with their best friends partner.\n\nIf I were the dude Illd be going for a three way or even an orgy if I scored the other girl.\n\nBut he does sound like a dick and would be annoying to deal with the drama.\n\nGirls fault for being floozies, a dog will keep looking for food if you feed it.\n\nNTA", "NTA but this is what happens when we encourage people to sleep around and act trashy", "NTA\n\nBut Ethan can bang who he wants. And if the girls are all stupid enough to bang him and fight over him that\u2019s their problem.", "ahh did ethan bang your crush?", "I mean, i do agree with him on one aspect; he\u2019s right that they should be able to make their own intelligent decisions, they should\u2019ve stopped even looking at him awhile ago. But that doesn\u2019t negate the fact that yeah, he should fuck off because he IS only stirring trouble. NTA, you\u2019re gonna end up in far less drama than he will", "What a nice little pot of toxic stew that's brewing over there with your roomie. NTA though, I'd consider severing ties and moving on to more mature friends and roommates.", "Nta", "NTA for saying it, but that should probably be the end of your involvement.", "Aren't the girls just as much AH as Ethan, if not more? They both cheated on the other when they're supposed to be friends. ESH", "NTA. Ethan sounds like a garden variety AH. Your best move is to not engage with him if he wants to brag about his \"conquests\". Tell him you don't agree with how he treats women and you don't want to hear about it. Then walk away. No discussion. No debate.\n\nAs far as the girls are concerned, I would try to avoid Ethan as a topic of discussion. You don't need to get pulled into the drama on either side. Again \"I don't agree with how he treats women.\", then move on. The only piece of advice I would give the girls is this: you teach people how to treat you. If a guy cheats on his and you forgive him, you just taught him that he can cheat on you.", "Fuck cheaters. NTA. Nothing you could have said would come close to being as harsh as what those girls may be feeling dealing with this dirtbag. Yes they should probably get the hint by now not to trust him but that's entirely his fault and he deserves whatever conaequence that brings him, the least of which would be one of his roommates telling him the truth about his behavior.", "NTA. Your advice was both sound and virtuous. Your roommate will eventually make some woman an unfaithful husband. Thanks for discouraging his bad behavior. Your other roommate is wrong. You weren\u2019t harsh enough.", " ESH.  Lol", "NTA. Ethan knows what he\u2019s doing, even if he acts like he doesn\u2019t. The \u201cequity\u201d statement proves that. If you\u2019re all friends between the two houses and hang out, then it\u2019s sort of like dating a roommate, which is common knowledge to avoid. I think Ethan needs to leave and stir shit up somewhere else where other people dont have to deal with the fallout.", "> Any self respectinging woman would have blocked him the moment they knew he was a cheater\n\nYeah. If it wasn't Ethan they were gonna betray each other over *someone*", "Or because all 3 are inexplicably options", "Chronically online", "Please read The Sociopath Next Door - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72536.The_Sociopath_Next_Door Even just the Goodreads summary may give you some insight into this guy and your situation.", ">I'd bet good money he's the same type of guy to turn down a serious relationship with a girl for having had multiple partners cause she's to 'easy'\n\nLOL, its almost like you know this guy personally", "I didn't realize they they cheated with Ethan without his involvement. whatever choices they make is on them, but Ethan is fully fucking aware of what he's doing. he's cheating, and lying about his intentions with these woman cause the only thing he's interested in is getting his dick wet. he's absolutely at fault.", "You could never step to the god.", "Someone can both be an asshole and make a valid point at the same time. If you're accusing him of SA'ing those girls you need to man up and say it. But ultimately it takes two (or in this case three or four) to tango. I don't care what he told them, those girls actively chose to sleep with him, they actively disregarded their friendships for him. If nothing else he must be a great lay.", "They kind of are. Willing to cheat with you and they will cheat on you as the saying goes. He is by far not a catch. Pretty sure Johnny Bravo had more respect for women then your roommate does. If Rebecca and Ashly want to ruin their early adult life with this imbecile that is their prerogative. He's shown them already who he is.  I would talk to the latest girl though, and give her a heads up. \"Hey Ethan is starting to see you as a possible romantic partner. He's sees dateing and people as a 'game'.  I'd turn him down, this will complicate your life for nothing by dating your roommates ex.\" I know you said you didn't want to be involved. Still it's the decent thing to do.", "There will be a point where that \"thrill\" will hit him in the balls if he keeps this up", "They ruined their own friendship", "I mean...they both slept with the dude knowing that he was in a relationship and cheating on the other, i say all of them are ah", "guys like Ethan act like the assholes they are because their friends don't call them on shit. op should have gotten involved long before now and told Ethan to knock his shit off.", "I mean, not necessarily. We don\u2019t know how much work Ethan has put into manipulating these women. We have no idea what he\u2019s telling them in order to convince them to fall back into bed with him. A more experienced woman might see through whatever bullshit he\u2019s feeding them, but they\u2019re clearly *not* experienced, and that\u2019s probably why Ethan is so enthralled with them. They *want* to believe whatever he\u2019s telling them, and so they do, and they don\u2019t yet understand what the long-term emotional consequences will be. \n\nIf they\u2019d never met Ethan, then this may never have come up. They weren\u2019t pre-destined to betray each other. It was not written in the stars.", "Thanks, don't know why you got downvoted", "I can't tell if that's an admission of how he thinks or not, but if I'm being frank, I don't need to know him to know how guys like him are. he dated a girl, knowing her best friend was into him, cheated on the girl with said friend, dated the friend, then cheated with the original girl to 'make things fair'. anyone with two braincells to rub together would take a bet that a guy like that would be a misogynistic asshole who would shame a girl for having had to many partners.", "They\u2019re 20. \n\nThey\u2019re full of hormones and unrealistically romanticized images of sex and relationships. Combine that with a lack of experience and a shaky sense of foresight and you\u2019re going to make the worst dating decisions you\u2019ll ever make in your life. \n\nLike\u2026we know this. This is a *terrible* age for relationships. This is why people side-eye <22 year olds who decide to get married. New adults are famous for harebrained romantic choices. These girls are not an exception.", "They're idiots? Only plausible explanation", "We still don't know what the guy is saying. But yeah they are not innocent", "They weren't pre-destined but they did it so easily. \n\nIt doesn't matter what he said to one of them. If she didn't want to fuck her \"friend's\" boyfriend she wouldn't have done it.", "Bro did he force the girls to have sex? No? Then they kinda ruined their own relationship", "which is exactly why Ethan acts the way he does. the people around him are to cowardly to call him on his shit. if he wants to sleep around more power to him, but he doesn't get tonlie about what his intentions are. he's an asshole and so are you and the rest of your roommates if you don't say anything", "Sorry to break it to you, but you're already actively involved. You said that you consider the women across the street to be \"pretty good friends,\" so act like one and let them know about your selfish dingdong of a roommate. By allowing him to continue manipulating these women and messing up their home life, you're prioritising your friendship with Ethan over them, which is weird considering you have nothing good to say about him. Clearly he's so selfish and entitled that he doesn't care whose life he disrupts, including yours. If you stay out of it as he wants, I promise you're only going to experience escalating drama going forward. \n\nWhat does this guy contribute to your household/life? What's special about his friendship? Ask yourself honestly whether you're happier to have him, or your neighbours as friends. He wants his cake, and yours, and that guy's, and the others' as well, and he also wants to smear the cake all over the place and then run away without cleaning it. Are you the chump who's gonna pick up after his childish ass?", "Then find new roommates. You made a Reddit post, it\u2019s pretty clear you wanted to actively involve yourself.", "You need to tell the girls that they are the ones allowing this to happen and to leave you out of it. They live together, and girls usually talk about who they are seeing with friends. So they are knowingly and willingly backstabbing eachother, its not your problem, and you should tell them as much.", "We really don\u2019t have enough details to know that.\n\nWe have no idea what kind of talks they\u2019ve had. We have no idea what Ethan said to them. We don\u2019t know if he lied about breaking up with one girl or the other, we don\u2019t know if either girl said they\u2019d step back and then changed her mind, we do not know anything. All OP has told us is the bare facts and a rough timeline of events. We don\u2019t know enough to say how \u201ceasily\u201d these girls decided to betray each other.", "Ethan knew full fucking well what he was doing. he may not be the sole asshole, but don't pretend that he wasn't getting off on playing the two of them against each other", "Lol why is she freaky?", ">if you don't say anything\n\nWell, I did say something admittable it was pretty minor. But I kinda think the girls should doing something as well. I mean, its not like he has some sort of crazy advantage over them...", ">What does this guy contribute to your household/life?\n\nWe're both paying rent here, and our lease goes until early May next year so we're all kinda stuck together. This was the main reason why I wanted to stay out of things and have largely been keeping quiet. That said, I will point out what he's doing as wrong whenever the opportunity comes up", "Sounds equitable", "This is how we did it in my time", "It wouldn't have been possible if they weren't already willing to bang the other's boyfriend.", "where did you see me say hes innocent my man, go back to middle school learn some reading comprehension", "She always talks to me about BDSM and that shit scares me. Also, since her older sister recently had a baby she claims to now have baby fever as well and said that she thinks I can help with that.\n\nAside from that she wonderful and lets me return books late without charging me.", "They meant if you don't say anything *to the girls*. But you knew that.", "Ethan already knows what he's doing is wrong, and he enjoys getting away with it. Impunity is taken, not given, as the worst person I've ever known once told me. But if you're going to address the issue directly with him, frame it just like you have now: You just want the next six months to be drama-free, and he's the one cocking that up by stirring shit amongst your friends. \n\nI realise it's a lot to ask, but it really would be for the best if you gave the third neighbour a heads up. She may very well ignore it just to get some of that D, but you could prevent that if you let her know he's just a big talker who leaves a mess everywhere. Tell her your slutty old Auntie guarantees she'll get plenty of good dick throughout her life without all this bullshit, she can do better than her housemates' sloppy seconds ;)", "A piece of peace is always worth it.", "Sometimes you have to make some sacrifices.", "I think a lot of people engage in an unwitting misogyny in these sorts of posts. The women are always just victims that need protecting, not, y'know, *people*, capable of making their own choices.", "and that absolves him of any wrong doing in your eyes? that's like saying the get away driver is innocent cause he would have been necessary if someone else hadn't planned on robbing the bank.", ">They meant if you don't say anything *to the girls*\n\nI know, but I'm pretty sure they all know as well since he's essentially working his way through that house.

They still want to fuck him, so clearly something is wrong with them.", "I mean he's a dipshit but it's not like he talked them into something they didn't want to do", "You'd be being a good friend??", "well you heard it first folks. lube4sale has let us all know that so long as your affair partner is cool with it, you can't be held accountable for being a cheater. from now on, any post that deals with affairs needs to answer whether the ap was cool with it, cause we're not allowed to call them assholes if the answer is yes \ud83d\ude44", "Difference between calling him an asshole and \"truly evil\" or that \"he may be capable eventually of inflicting truly huge harm on a missing-persons level.\"", "I mean you're taking it pretty personal.
