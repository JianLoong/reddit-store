But like you said, the child has done nothing wrong, and it would be beyond cruel to just ignore him while you're being an active grandparent to the 2 other children. \n\nI'd sit down with your son and explain it calmly. How much harm cutting contact with that child would cause him and how you actually love him.", "NTA. You sound lovely.", "The child is an innocent and you are a good person who is treating the child nicely and lovingly. Life is long and the good you do will result in the grandson becoming a good person. Your son could learn a valuable lesson from you. However he is not ready for that.", " NTA. The whole situation is not the kids fault. The kid deserves love & a loving grandma.", "NTA- however, you need to understand extreme hurt that this is going to do to your son. You guys need to have an open honest conversation in which you need to explain in the in the best most sympathetic way possible are you understand that he\u2019s in pain but it\u2019s not about taking sides. It\u2019s about the child. Don\u2019t downplay\u2019s feelings either your son just went through one of the worst pains that you can, and you need to understand that. Also, this can intern affect your relationship with your son. If you cannot come to an understanding, this could possibly ruin your relationship with him completely if it is not handled delicately.", "Hey there! It's a complex situation you're in, and I can understand why emotions are running high. In my opinion, you're NTA (Not the Asshole) for wanting to continue your relationship with your ex-daughter-in-law's child and showing love and care towards him.\n\nYou have formed a bond with this child over the years, and it's natural to feel attached and loving towards him, even though he's not biologically related to you. It's commendable that you want to maintain a connection and support him, as he isn't at fault for the actions of his parents.\n\nHowever, it's also crucial to understand your son's perspective. He may be going through a lot emotionally, and the situation might be a painful reminder of the past for him. While you can continue to show love and care for the child, it's essential to have a compassionate and open conversation with your son about your feelings and intentions.\n\nLet him know that your actions are not meant to betray him or take sides but rather to support a child you care about. At the same time, try to empathize with his feelings and find a way to strike a balance that works for both of you.\n\nRemember, family dynamics can be complicated, but honest communication and understanding can go a long way in resolving conflicts and maintaining strong relationships. Best of luck in navigating through this situation!", " NTA, kiddos need all the love we can give them.\n\nSierra messed up and your son is justifiably hurt by that but what a loss to this child, his dad is out of the picture suddenly and he has no idea why.\n\nThank you for being a stable influence for him.", "Sorry, but ESH. \n\nI get you\u2019re attached and trying to do right, but it\u2019s also a slap in your son\u2019s face. There\u2019s no way he can separate the horrible betrayal by his ex wife and you\u2019re his mother. Imagine your son\u2019s feelings. Are you going to be in this child\u2019s life forever as the grandparent? Are you going to choose to ignore your son\u2019s pain? There is no good option, but your choices will have a long lasting impact. \n\nYou hid this from him. Now he\u2019s again feeling betrayed.", "I\u2019m gonnna go with YTA, you betrayed your all ready betrayed son.", "Eshhh. I can\u2019t judge him, I would feel some type of way. For the people saying the child is innocent he is but he see\u2019s the child as a reminder of the infidelity.", "I\u2019m gonna go with YTA couldn\u2019t imagine doing this to my son", "NTA!!! Oh my gosh!! That poor baby had his life turned upside down, and now he\u2019s living with his siblings and is basically being treated like he\u2019s unwanted by the man he thought was his father who raised him for 4years\u2026the only way you\u2019re an asshole is by having a son who\u2019s an asshole. But you\u2019re still not an asshole because sometimes kids go rogue no matter how much you teach them. Give that little boy love! He needs it! It would be terrible if you gave gifts to the other two and not him. Heck no..and if the kids are living with mom anyways, your son has no say over your relationship with that boy. Keep giving him the love he deserves and tell your son you raised him better.", "This was not an immaculate conception. Is the real father and his family not involved? Your actions may be naking your son feel like you think he should have maintained a father role in the kids life because you have continued as a grandparent.", "Nta why should you exclude the 4 year old I\u2019m glad you still include him\n\nEdit: I just realised he brought him up fo 4 years and he doesn\u2019t care for him at all", "NTA. Good human, good heart, good grandma. The child is blameless and is also the half sibling of your grandchildren. Not yours by DNA, but by love. \ud83d\udc97", "NTA, IMO. The world is too often a cold, ugly, lonely place.\n\nSo many kids don\u2019t have nearly enough people in their lives who love them. And all three of them have you.\n\nYou sound like a lovely person. And - what\u2019s the alternative? Giving presents to two young children and not the third, who (I assume) the first two think is their full, not half-sibling?\n\nI paused for a moment on this. Because, I understand the profound hurt and betrayal your son is feeling. But - to the extent that his other two kids think the third is still their \u201cfull\u201d sibling, the idea that you\u2019d be grandma to two of them and give the cold shoulder to the third would be hurtful and confusing to his two children.\n\nSo as much as I absolutely understand your son\u2019s emotions, I can\u2019t help but think this is a moment to push them aside for the sake of his two children.", "NTA.  Good Grandpa! Keep at it.", "NTA, you\u2019re doing a nice and good thing for a child. Good for you, keep it up", "NTA. And thank you for not being one.\n\nYour grandson already knows that \"daddy\" resents him, but not his siblings. Given his reaction to you, he clearly does. And sadly, this kid's gonna think it's his fault, that he's the reason mommy and daddy aren't together, that he did something wrong by existing.\n\nIt's so understandable that your son is angry, but that anger belongs to Sierra, not her child. Thank you for treating him as the grandson you always knew him as. You're giving him the love he needs and deserves.", "NTA - I understand your son is hurt but it's not the kids fault.  If parting ways with him is hard for you, just imagine it from the child's perspective!\n\nNo, you're in the right as far as I can see, but I can see why your son finds it hard to come to terms with.
