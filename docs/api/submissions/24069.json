You guys need to have an open honest conversation in which you need to explain in the in the best most sympathetic way possible are you understand that he\u2019s in pain but it\u2019s not about taking sides. It\u2019s about the child. Don\u2019t downplay\u2019s feelings either your son just went through one of the worst pains that you can, and you need to understand that.

It's a complex situation you're in, and I can understand why emotions are running high. In my opinion, you're NTA (Not the Asshole) for wanting to continue your relationship with your ex-daughter-in-law's child and showing love and care towards him.\n\nYou have formed a bond with this child over the years, and it's natural to feel attached and loving towards him, even though he's not biologically related to you. It's commendable that you want to maintain a connection and support him, as he isn't at fault for the actions of his parents.\n\nHowever, it's also crucial to understand your son's perspective. He may be going through a lot emotionally, and the situation might be a painful reminder of the past for him. While you can continue to show love and care for the child, it's essential to have a compassionate and open conversation with your son about your feelings and intentions.\n\nLet him know that your actions are not meant to betray him or take sides but rather to support a child you care about. At the same time, try to empathize with his feelings and find a way to strike a balance that works for both of you.\n\nRemember, family dynamics can be complicated, but honest communication and understanding can go a long way in resolving conflicts and maintaining strong relationships. Best of luck in navigating through this situation!", " NTA, kiddos need all the love we can give them.\n\nSierra messed up and your son is justifiably hurt by that but what a loss to this child, his dad is out of the picture suddenly and he has no idea why.\n\nThank you for being a stable influence for him.", "Sorry, but ESH. \n\nI get you\u2019re attached and trying to do right, but it\u2019s also a slap in your son\u2019s face.

Are you going to be in this child\u2019s life forever as the grandparent? Are you going to choose to ignore your son\u2019s pain? There is no good option, but your choices will have a long lasting impact. \n\nYou hid this from him.

But you\u2019re still not an asshole because sometimes kids go rogue no matter how much you teach them. Give that little boy love! He needs it! It would be terrible if you gave gifts to the other two and not him. Heck no..and if the kids are living with mom anyways, your son has no say over your relationship with that boy. Keep giving him the love he deserves and tell your son you raised him better.", "This was not an immaculate conception. Is the real father and his family not involved?

The world is too often a cold, ugly, lonely place.\n\nSo many kids don\u2019t have nearly enough people in their lives who love them.

Giving presents to two young children and not the third, who (I assume) the first two think is their full, not half-sibling?\n\nI paused for a moment on this. Because, I understand the profound hurt and betrayal your son is feeling. But - to the extent that his other two kids think the third is still their \u201cfull\u201d sibling, the idea that you\u2019d be grandma to two of them and give the cold shoulder to the third would be hurtful and confusing to his two children.\n\nSo as much as I absolutely understand your son\u2019s emotions, I can\u2019t help but think this is a moment to push them aside for the sake of his two children.", "NTA.

And sadly, this kid's gonna think it's his fault, that he's the reason mommy and daddy aren't together, that he did something wrong by existing.\n\nIt's so understandable that your son is angry, but that anger belongs to Sierra, not her child. Thank you for treating him as the grandson you always knew him as. You're giving him the love he needs and deserves.", "NTA - I understand your son is hurt but it's not the kids fault.  If parting ways with him is hard for you, just imagine it from the child's perspective!\n\nNo, you're in the right as far as I can see, but I can see why your son finds it hard to come to terms with.

Did I say I am surprised by the fact he left? No. I am surprised he doesn\u2019t care at all yes. Why are you not? \n\nIsn\u2019t demanding everyone feels the same as him taking it too far?

Knowing how much he has been traumatised by his mother already? \n\nI get what you are saying now, yikes, I\u2019ve seen men in bits after situations like this and they also couldn\u2019t bear to be involved themselves by they still felt for the kid so they would consider their feelings and would understand why some people in the family may want to maintain a relationship even if they can\u2019t do it themselves. \n\nI guess I\u2019m naive I shouldn\u2019t give men the benefit of the doubt, I should assume like you that after 4 years all feelings are gone including extending sympathy to a child you believed to be your son. \n\nI dunno if it\u2019s more sad what you said is how he feels, or that you and the people downvoting me are not surprised by this.\n\nI am surprised, 4 years, an innocent child, you are asking  your mum to exclude him because \u201cyou are taking her side\u201d instead of thinking that poor little boy it would break his heart even more and his mother has caused him enough trauma as it is. \n\nI am actually depressed now I was happier when I believed he\u2019s grieving his relationship with him. It\u2019s even more depressing that people are not surprised. \n\nNobody was avoiding your point it\u2019s just I didn\u2019t think people could hit a low so low even satan he\u2019s judging them. \n\nCool you are right are u satisfied now?\n\nEdit: whatever mistakes i could spot"]}
