She has pulled a bait and switch on you.\n\nThe best thing to do is consult a lawyer, not only for this situation but for all future situations you may encounter.

How about offering something to make it up to it? Did she instead gaslight you?\n\nFriendships are mostly seasonal. Sometimes they change, priorities change, we all change with time after all. Right now it sounds like she only cares about herself and the business. That is how it sounds. You can try sitting down with her and express how she violated your boundaries and basically betrayed her trust. You can see if she cares about you enough to try to mend it. If it is only her, her, her, then that is your answer.", "Also to add it doesn't have to be nuclear. Either remove photos or never speak again. You can also distance yourself. Reduce the contact. And you can talk with a lawyer and your friend how to solve this so it won't do too much damage to the business. Like no more posters, immediately edit website photos (that is free after all). There are options. Photoshopping hair in front of your face even? The main thing is what you would be comfortable with. \n\nTo add, I am overweight, average looking, even before the kids. I would love to look ad good as you, but guess what? That does not in any way mean you should feel the same way. Just because people think you look fine, it doesn't mean your insecurities are invalid. I think a lot of people, models included, have things they don't like or wish were better etc. But while they are valid, I do wish you would love your body. It's a journey, but I hope you get there. And even if you love every bit, it is still ok to say no. You can still say no to having your face publicized like that. This is not about her. This is about you.", "She paid the photographer for taking the pictures. I don\u2019t know if the store owner paid her for photos. I don\u2019t think so.", "Then the photos belong to the photographer or whoever they sold them to."]}
