(that's victim blaming.) please read what you wrote over again, you gave her your boundary many times, she agreed to that boundary, she broke that boundary, and then she blamed you for reacting to her breaking that boundary AND is trying to make it your fault she would have to pay someone to do a thing you did for free but no longer want her to access because she didn't respect your very clear wishes about it.\n\nMaybe she was a good friend at some point, but this woman is taking advantage of you, and she will do that in the future again because she sees you as someone she *can* take advantage of.  Whatever help she may have given you in the past, well first friendships aren't transactional but it sounds like you have already helped her model previously, for free, so any \"debt\" you owe is over, and \"owing someone\" (you did NOT) doesn't mean they get to your cross your boundaries.  You are allowed to say No at any point, whether the pictures are revealing or not, whether you look good in them or not, whether you have done it for her before or not. \n\nLike, she broke your consent and then told you to grow up when you reacted to it because HER business matters more than a) your consent and b) how those pictures could affect you currently or in the future. Do you really want someone like that in your life? \n\n(also that dude is a walking red flag and if you do decide to stick with him - though you really shouldn't - please never EVER sext with him because he will 100% post your nudes if he gets mad at you.)", "NTA\nYour friend was very misleading.", "NTA. She specifically said they'd be less revealing, not more, and she's using you for further economic benefit than you offered her. \n\nmake peace with her but demand payment in smexy underoos", "> the contract was implied\n> \n> Lololol, that's not how contracts work.\n\n[implied in fact contracts](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/contract_implied_in_fact) are a literally a thing.\n\n(no idea if it applies here, but it's a misconception that you have to sign something to be beholden to a contract)", "Not a partner, just a first date. No big loss. Except he\u2019s a chef, I was excited to hang out with him. I\u2019ve already declined a second date.", "She KNEW your boundaries and intentionally stomped all over them.  Fact is you didn\u2019t consent- you only let her take the pictures on the express condition your face would get cropped out, and she didn\u2019t crop your face out.  Not only that, but she displayed the pictures you expressly told her to take down in a public place.  Your feelings of betrayal are appropriate.", "Even if it does apply, there's also the fact that the photographer used OP's face after promising not to. Use of the model's face can have a separate value in photo releases.", "But you didn\u2019t give consent for the photos in the way in which she is using them. She violated your trust and took advantage of you, going directly against your expressed will. BTW, you are NTA.", "Then IMMEDIATELY send her a cease-and-desist letter. You are totally in the clear, legally (and morally).\n\nNTA.", "This is NOT a misunderstanding. She wouldn't have had to lead you down the flowery path like those creepy fuckers who coerce young girls who think they're getting discovered as models into doing porn of it was a misunderstanding.\n\nIf it was a misunderstanding, she would be *horrified* by your reaction and immediately resolve the issues by keeping her word to have you face removed and only use the pictures you agreed to."]}
