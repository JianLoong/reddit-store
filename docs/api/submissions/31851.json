Here\u2019s the situation: Back when I was nineteen in college, starting my startup company and needed extra money, I donated my sperm. I got paid well, and it went to a woman who wanted to have a surrogate. She hired a college student (Molly) and wanted to use her eggs and my sperm since both she and her husband were infertile.\n\nLong story short, something happened, and the couple wanted to abort the baby, but Molly refused. They went to court, and Molly kept the baby, not the money. I was already long gone by then and forgot I even had a bio daughter till I got a phone call from Molly yesterday. \nTo sum it all up, my bio-daughter was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.  \n\nThe doctor gave her a list of things that she now needs to survive, like blood glucose metre, test strips, lancets, insulin, insulin syringes or pen needles and (a CGM) system. Without insurance, all these items cost over a thousand dollars. And Molly doesn't have insurance.\n\n(Nor anything to her name since she dropped out of college for a baby she couldn\u2019t afford.)\n\nBefore I could call anyone a liar, Molly sent me plenty of proof of medical papers of her daughter papers and the needed cost. However, I told her no and reminded her that she fought in court to keep her. And In no way I\u2019m paying a thing. But I'm guessing she didn\u2019t like my laughing tone because she began shouting. She began railing on how the first thing I say is no when I find out my daughter I\u2019ve never met needs medical care. But I repeated my answer and told her I wasn\u2019t arguing about something  I had already decided on.\n\nBut that\u2019s when she threatened to sue me for child support. Shouting how I haven\u2019t paid anything in twelve years and she\u2019s going to drain me dry. Calling me a greedy, selfish person who could easily afford to pay for her daughter's medical bills without me even noticing anyone left my account. She even dared to say all the money I have rightfully belongs to \u201cour\u201d daughter since I used the donor money to help my startup, which is now very successful. But I immediately hung up and blocked her. \n\nI didn\u2019t feel like being continually threatened and screamed at for a child that isn\u2019t my responsibility. I\u2019m about to have a child of my own with my wife and don\u2019t need this kind of stress. \n\nSo AITA.", "created_utc": 1701103895, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1857gwr/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_12yrs_old/", "score": 1874, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Here\u2019s the situation: Back when I was nineteen in college, starting my startup company and needed extra money, I donated my sperm. I got paid well, and it went to a woman who wanted to have a surrogate. She hired a college student (Molly) and wanted to use her eggs and my sperm since both she and her husband were infertile.\n\nLong story short, something happened, and the couple wanted to abort the baby, but Molly refused. They went to court, and Molly kept the baby, not the money. I was already long gone by then and forgot I even had a bio daughter till I got a phone call from Molly yesterday. \nTo sum it all up, my bio-daughter was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.  \n\nThe doctor gave her a list of things that she now needs to survive, like blood glucose metre, test strips, lancets, insulin, insulin syringes or pen needles and (a CGM) system. Without insurance, all these items cost over a thousand dollars. And Molly doesn't have insurance.\n\n(Nor anything to her name since she dropped out of college for a baby she couldn\u2019t afford.)\n\nBefore I could call anyone a liar, Molly sent me plenty of proof of medical papers of her daughter papers and the needed cost. However, I told her no and reminded her that she fought in court to keep her. And In no way I\u2019m paying a thing. But I'm guessing she didn\u2019t like my laughing tone because she began shouting. She began railing on how the first thing I say is no when I find out my daughter I\u2019ve never met needs medical care. But I repeated my answer and told her I wasn\u2019t arguing about something  I had already decided on.\n\nBut that\u2019s when she threatened to sue me for child support. Shouting how I haven\u2019t paid anything in twelve years and she\u2019s going to drain me dry. Calling me a greedy, selfish person who could easily afford to pay for her daughter's medical bills without me even noticing anyone left my account. She even dared to say all the money I have rightfully belongs to \u201cour\u201d daughter since I used the donor money to help my startup, which is now very successful. But I immediately hung up and blocked her. \n\nI didn\u2019t feel like being continually threatened and screamed at for a child that isn\u2019t my responsibility. I\u2019m about to have a child of my own with my wife and don\u2019t need this kind of stress. \n\nSo AITA.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m not sure what you are saying here, no court is going to force parental rights onto people who vocally do not want the child (much different from parental responsibility). What are the courts even gonna do? Send cops over to their house and force them to have scheduled visitations? How would you even realistically enforce parental rights when the parents don\u2019t want the child?

But, things are never simple. The whole reason why Africa has insulin pen's at all is because the US has subsidized them with inflated costs.

For this story to be true, they would have to be in a jurisdiction where surrogacy is legal, and in that case, they'd look at the surrogacy contract and figure out what legal responsibility the parents who contracted for the child have. No one is ever going to force the carrier to have an abortion, but the couple who contracted for the child might have a legal responsibility to provide, at a minimum, financial support to the child.
