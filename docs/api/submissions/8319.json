You should feel no guilt that they don't want to be responsible for their own decisions but want YOU to.\n\nIf you can afford counseling, that's where I suggest you spend your extra money.\n\nHelpful tactic....grey rock method works here.  You want peace?  Go LC or NC.", "do not talk to them. I think it is pointless. Please. it does not do you any good, they don't give one crap about your welfare. keep this foremost. they don't care about you.", "Their decisions are their decisions.  You obligation as an adult is take care of yourself.  Go NC if they don't stop.", "I know someone who routinely borrows money from her adult children and her disabled mother who lives on a fixed income because she doesn't know how to manage her spending. This person is an adult who \"works\" full time. I put works in quotes because she routinely calls out to smoke weed and play dead by dawn and from her complaints before we stopped being friends her work is itching to find an excuse to fire her legally. She's the only income for a family of seven, 3 of which are children 10 and under. Spends all her money on weed and ubereats. Which I do too, but I only do that AFTER I pay all my bills and buy food for the house etc. I lost track of how many times I had to buy them food because she was broke from spending her money on weed and tongue burritos via uber.", "Absolutely agree. I have many issues with my FIL, he's a difficult man. However, despite living on disability and pension benefits he has never once asked us for money. We'll help him out if, as an example, his microwave breaks, but as a gift, never because he's demanded it. It's ridiculous that your parents think it's fine for your mother to have never worked yet expect you to pay their mortgage.", "NTA block their numbers for a little bit. They're adults who decided to buy a home they cannot afford. That is not your problem", "NTA. Your mom is perfectly capable of making that money. Tell her she can get her lazy butt up and work.", "NTA. Their dumb choices are not your problem.", "NTA", "NTA. Your parents are making financial decisions and expecting you to cover them. Don't. If they can't afford the mortgage, they need to either find a way to make those payments or give up the house. It is NOT your responsibility.", "NTA \n\nYour parents have decided that you are their retirement plan. \n\nIf you have nothing else to say to them, explain that you\u2019re unable and frankly not responsible for covering their mortgage, and if that\u2019s all they want from you then they should stop calling.", "NTA and don\u2019t feel guilty maybe go low contact or no contact for awhile. This is going to affect your mental health. Your parent\u2019s financial troubles aren\u2019t your fault or problem and btw you don\u2019t owe them for raising you, they chose to have a kid and that means it\u2019s their responsibility to pay for you until you are an adult. It seems to me that you were more responsible then they. Again DO NOT FEEL GUILTY.", "Jesus, what kind of parents would ask their kids to pay for their mortgage? They're the assholes in this equation, op", "***\"....my parents have been accusing me that I don't help them financially.\"***\n\nNor should you.\n\nIt's highly unlikely that you would qualify for a second mortgage on a different property anyway.\n\nYou parents need to learn to take care of themselves, and live within their OWN means.\n\nNTA.", "NTA! But your parents are for sure. The fact that your mother expects you to get a mortgage, so that they can own a house, but she won\u2019t work, that makes them mayor assholes!!", "Wtf is wrong with your parents?! Makes me so angry how they treat you. They should have been working hard all along to help you and themselves not the other way around. Their choices in life are not your problem.", "Dropping this in here; as someone who is of your parents generation I can honestly say that they've got fuck all excuse for not owning their own home. About 30 years ago a lot of property in the UK was cheap as chips; you could pick up a 3 bed house in a decent area for no more than \u00a350k, less if you were willing to do it up. Prices soared up over the next fifteen years and have continued to, mainly due to bad government policy around pensions and \"right to buy\" on social housing. \n\nTldr: if they're in their 50s they could have bought a house years ago and probably paid it off by now. Don't indulge them.\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA, my biomum is similar to your mum because she asked me for large amounts of money/told me I was a bad son for not helping, when I was literally in my student overdraft and had given her \u00a3600 to help her move. Worst decision I made. Needless to say I cut her off, definitely recommend what a lot of other commenters are saying about pretending to be busy every time they call and hassle you.\n\nAt the end of the day their bad finances aren't your problem, if your mum doesn't want to work that's on her, she's made her bed she can lie in it. Please remember this isn't your fault and also you're their kid they shouldn't be relying on you financially!", "You're NTA, and  \"NO\" is a complete sentence. Anytime you say more, they'll keep arguing. Just say no, as many times as it takes.", "Cut them off", "NTA. Every time they ask, put them in a timeout. No contact for a month.", "NTA actions have consequences, your mother will need to work to pay for the mortgage. Otherwise they\u2019ll lose the home.

You don't live with them, why would you even have to pay? Go LC or even NC for a bit.", "NTA. They need to understand that not only isn't this your responsibility,  you're highly unlikely to be able to get another mortgage anyway. It's not the early 00s anymore, where anyone can just get approved for anything. Don't let them push you into cosigning anything either, it's astonishing how many people get their finances nuked by doing this.", "I\u2019ve seen this kind of behavior before. It\u2019s a standard manipulation tactic by lazy moochers. Had a friend whose GF pulled this. The day he got a job, she quit hers. I mean, most of us would like to not work, but we have to support ourselves\u2014and so do OP\u2019s parents. NTA and cut them off before they bleed you dry.", "NTA, they are manipulators to the extreme.  I would go either LC or NC and stay that way.", "This is NOT your fault- your parents wanted a house. They got jobs to finance the house. They got hr house. Now they don\u2019t want to provide the finances required to keep the house? Tell them to sell and rent or buy something cheaper. This amid NOT your problem to solve. They\u2019ve shown that they are capable just unwilling. You should cut all conversations with them regarding money and mortgages.", "Is it YOUR mortgage ? No, then it's not your fault.\n\nHow hard is that. If your parent say crazy things, you treat them like the cracked at the station, they crazy. But don't blindly believe them when they say crazy shit\n\n\nNTA", "Try r/raisedbynarcissists. There's a lot of good advice on managing contact there.", "Cut Contact. Permanently. Immediately.", "I have a friend who is Indian and is caught in the same sort of vice as you.

Your mother never intended to keep working, the plan was to just to it to convince you to help and get you stuck with continuing to make the payment. You never agreed to help them, and if having their own home wasn't enough of a priority while raising you (since your mom made the choice not to work) why should you make it your priority to house them now?", "You know you are doing the right thing not doing as your parents wished - they chose to buy a property but that don\u2019t want to maintain the work hours needed to pay the mortgage- that has nothing to do with you what so ever. \n\nIf you did help them, they would expect every time they needed money. They are both adults, capable of common sense and making financial decision. \n\nI have a similar ongoing issues with my older sister and her husband, not quite this bad as your parents but they are really bad at managing finances, they make poor choices, and focus on wants rather than essential living costs, so they struggle month to month as a result. For years, I used to bail them out, only ask for portion of the loan back, but realised that I was not helping them, at one point we rented a property together because of their low wage and low hours jobs, but I ended paying more and more the bill which only in my name. Also, my sister has a tendency to blame others for lack of money, because so and so took money out of bank, but she didnt agree, but I know she signs up for things, doesn\u2019t keep track of bills, contracts she agrees to, then complain about having agreed to payment plans and that she broke until one of them get paid. \n\nI have since stopped bailing them out, you need to put yourself first and consider your own financial needs and allow them to deal with the consequences of their own actions.", "Ok so they artificially inflate their earnings, then buy an overly expensive house, go back down to one income afterwards, and now expect you to pay for it? NTA. There's just no way on earth that that's an acceptable thing for parents to do.", "NTA. Not your job to pay for your parents home. Your mom can get off her ass and work. I am 63 and still working. That's why I have nice things.", "NTA", "NTA and No Contact with exploitative, manipulative relatives is a Good Thing.

When they call you for any reason and start to talk about you getting a mortgage for them or paying for their mortgage, hang up the phone.  If you are talking to them in person and they do it literally turn around and walk away. You don't owe them because of their life choices or circumstances just because you are in a better place than they were at your age", "Why do you even speak to these people?", "Oh, no. I am SO sorry your parents are doing this to you. DO NOT offer to give them any money or sign anything for them. They are old enough to create their own budget and to stick to it. They aren\u2019t your responsibility, you are supposed to be theirs. \n\nAlso, if this is how your parents are, I imagine there\u2019s a lot more to deal with than this one situation. I\u2019d like to encourage you to find a therapist or other professional to talk to, this is so much more than anyone should have to go through alone, and a therapist could offer some good advice and guidance in these situations.", "If it suits you financially to INVEST Z in their home do so sad long as they sign half of the equity over to you. If not. Ask them if they know any Rogers and Hammerstein and tell them to whistle for it", "Ofc, NTA. THEYRE the parents. If anyone should be calling someone for money, it\u2019s the 22/23 year old asking their parents for money. You owe them nothing. Yes, they raised you, but that\u2019s what you do when you have a kid. Why do they expect you to contribute to something that you\u2019re bot even benefiting from.", "Massive NTA. I got angry reading this. How dare your parents do that to you? Nope, unacceptable.", "They are TA for even asking. Ignore them.", "NTA. I was a teenage mum and have always rented and will never be able to buy a house (worked full time since my child started school, part time before that). My 'kiddo' who is now a similar age to OP,  owns their own place now and i couldn't be prouder. It makes me happy that they have done so well for themselves and would never ask them for any sort of support. In fact I put money in their bank account when I can so they have fun money because they should be enjoying life in their 20s.", "NTA. Your parents are manipulative. You could go LC with them", "NTA. \n\nSo dad is calling you daily to complain that your mom has to work since you won\u2019t support her.

Even bare subsistence living often requires two incomes.\n\nNTA.", "take your r/antiwork shit elsewhere", "Right, I'm reading this as a mother and I'm sure the look on my face was just disgust. The idea of treating my children like that just disgusts me.....", "NTA. Your parents are lazy- especially your mom. So they basically expect you to work more so they can be lazy and not work. Your parents are awful. Don\u2019t give them any money and stop talking to them if they won\u2019t stop being asshats.", "NTA. At best a parent should be willing to help their child with a mortgage and not the other way around.

Live your life.", "NTA, they have lived their lives in a way that makes home ownership a tall order. Your mom especially since she didn't want to work so they can actually pat the mortgage!", "I can get on board with your comment but it should too be stated that no is a complete sentence.  OP shouldn't set herself on fire to keep other people warm.  OP doesn't have spare funds to subsidize her unreasonable parents.  And, OP wants to go low to no contact and I believe OP is looking for reassurance that that is okay... which given the unlikely scenario where her parents are going to stop demanding OP's servitude, is 100% the right call.  \n\nNo one should be made to or guilted into providing for people who have the ability to take care of themselves, but choose not to.", "I don't think OP needs to make up an excuse. Just be upfront and say, \"we already discussed that and the answer is now. I'm ending this conversation now.\" If they care about OP they will stop. But they don't care so probably they will stop calling or OP will get the courage to distance themselves from their parents."]}
