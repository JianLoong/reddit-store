No wonder it\u2019s going to shit. And for people who say it\u2019s the same as someone sharing a table at a restaurant? Are you for real? Or just that stupid?

If tables are that small you're allowed to have your own damn space. \nTo everyone saying yta, do you not remember the great panini that the world just went through?

This should have been a normal social interaction that neither ever thought of again. I was thinking they were going to be talking about a big picnic table or something. \n\nI'm actually shook by how many people are saying Y T A.

I\u2019ve never heard that being the norm.", "Was 2 feet across. Way to small to be sitting with someone you dont know.

He should of been told to kick rocks.", "Curious since they said the table fits 3 people if you would cuss OP out as well if they said no to you and a friend asking to join? \n\nSimilarly, I love dates at the park. Should my husband and I not go on dates in a public park if we're not wanting a stranger to join? I cannot imagine cussing out a couple that didn't want me to join their date. \n\nIts not unreasonable to occupy a small table, 2 people under capacity, in a public park and not want others to join.", "i totally agree", "Do you realize how small a bistro table is?", "OP says it was a bistro table, so probably closer to a two person size, than four.", "This is key info - NTA. Almost went the other way thinking these were large picnic tables.\n\nIn general, public seating is shared - think cafeterias and bus benches. People share the tables. It just is what it is.\n\nBut a little bistro table? Not so much, especially since your food and what you\u2019re working on already clog the space.

This is the exact park and tables that came to my mind as well, and I would feel really strange if someone asked to share my table. If they asked to take an extra chair from the table and bring it to sit somewhere else, fine, and OP seemed willing to do that, but OP had claim to the table. They weren't single-handedly commandeering a large picnic table meant for a group of people; they're talking about a small table and deserve that personal space.

If there are people at all the tables then the tables are full! Even if not every seat at every table is occupied. I might ask someone if I could take a chair but that\u2019s it.", "yup. i used to eat in bryant park as well when i worked in midtown and those tables are TINY. it's so rare to have any sense of 'alone time' in the city and i wouldn't want to share one of them with a total stranger. if OP's table was that size and people commenting could see how small they really are, i think alot of the comments would be different.", ">Have the outraged people crying Y T A ever actually lived or worked in a major city? This is insane to me. I\u2019ve waited, circled, and ate my lunch on a ledge before, if nothing opened up.  What is this nonsense.\n\nYep. My entire life. And the two times I had to ask someone if I could sit at their table because everything else was full and the couple of times someone asked me for the same? Were fine.", "Seriously! I have found a set of steps many many a time to eat lunch as there has been no where else to sit. Some people may be bold enough to ask but it's not the norm.

The thought of a 2foot wide table just did not compute for me when in a park.\n\nThe only hint I really had that it was a small table was when OP said that comment about the size.

One person is extremely anti social, so they decide that they get to drink water at the water cooler at 10:00 every day, nobody else does.  \n   \nOn day the power and water go out due to utility upgrades or building issues.

Sure, but that's just that, courtesy.
