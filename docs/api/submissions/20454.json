Will be fun in a few years when she wonders why she doesn't have contact with you.", "NTA. Your mom is cracked. Has she always acted like this or is it new behavior?

Yes, seriously.", "Yeah, I am inclined to agree with that.  When I first told her I was gay, she went around telling people\nI thought I was gay but I really was just a confused virgin.

Calling it incestuous just seemed random to me.\n\nI'm very on board with her actions not being okay. I'm just unsure on how any of this was incestuous.", "Outing someone against their will damn sure isn\u2019t a boundary issue, it\u2019s homophobic. \n\nGiggling while having the most homophobic relatives rub noses as a \u2018dare\u2019 feels homophobic as well.\n\nThe entire situation is weird af and it seems like it was all a set up from the mother to forcibly out her child.

My aunt pulled out a deck of 18+ Truth or Dare Jenga tiles, and my mother decided to go along with that, forcing everybody to play along.

Whether you pick truth or dare, each challenge is always too \"safe\" to be interesting, or it pushes someone's boundaries too far.", "\"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity\"", "Ask her if she thinks it was a fun, successful night. If her goal was to piss half the family off, then she achieved her goal. If she truly wants to people to believe she\u2019s a caring, supportive Mom she failed miserably. \n\nThe world is full of people who are very happy to judge, criticize & make others miserable. Family should be the last people on the planet who willingly create chaos in our lives.", "OP replied to my comment with other homophobic things the mother has done. She\u2019s a homophobe. It was obvious from the post even before the added details", "Still, going off the original context of the post alone, it's a leap to assume intolerance over ignorance. Assuming pure bigotry from a handful of paragraphs from someone else's POV is just drastic. It's one of reddit's many problems I suppose, no one wants to give the benefit of the doubt anymore.", "I assumed homophobia from her behavior at the gathering and also the gaslighting at the end. It seemed very obvious to.", "The last comment seemed more anti-mental health rather than Homophobia tbh. And if she was ignorant like I assumed before, it wouldn't have been out of character for her to also be ignorant towards other modern awareness issues.\n\nI need to sleep now, feel free to continue but don't expect a quick response. \ud83d\udc4b"]}
