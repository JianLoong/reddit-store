But let\u2019s be real. I speak as a woman around your age who was a single mother for five years. I get being a mom is tough, but girl, you are a stay at home mom. He works a job and he just took care of the kids all day. Cut him some slack. Not everyone wants to be hanging out with kids all day, even their own. It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t love them or that they\u2019re a bad parent. Clearly he\u2019s a loving parent who provides for his children or I doubt you\u2019d remain with him and continue having children with him. I certainly agree that he should have just let you shower and chill, but you way overreacted then came on Reddit to farm sympathy for being a beleaguered stay at home mom. Girl, if you don\u2019t want to be a stay at home mom, have a conversation with your husband about it. If you do and this was just an off day, apologize to your husband and then explain why you were upset in a mature manner. \n\nThe fact that this upset you so much indicates that there\u2019s something deeper going on, be it resentment or just general overwhelm with the stress of being a stay at home mother. There is no shame in that, but you need to acknowledge it and address it rather than just saying \u201cboooo, my husband, amirite guys??\u201d That will not help you and it will have a detrimental effect on your marriage. You guys got through the loss of a child, something that would break many young couples. You must have developed better communication skills than this. I think deep down, you know you overreacted and you want to justify it, because the alternative puts you in the wrong in a situation where you were inherently in the right. He should have tucked your daughter in. You should have explained that calmly rather than throwing a tantrum. If you had, he probably would have gone and done it.", "If he demanded it to you exactly how you typed yea he\u2019s an ass\n\nIf he asked you to do it then y\u2019all are just tired and frustrated.\n\nMy kids liked momma putting them down they will just cry and fit until she popped in. I tried a lot and they would just cry momma until she came in lmfao\n\nSo I can see a lot of ways this might not be a full picture", "NTA.   I hate it when one partner thinks they\u2019re spouse of the year for simply pitching in on child rearing or chores.  He totally deserved that", "NTA.\n\nMorning to afternoon is *not* all day and it\u2019s really just convenient that he can say No and actually not have to do it.

As a husband this sizzles. I am ashamed to admit I  have been in his shoes.\n\nNTA. I have teenagers now. I have gained more nurturing/patience (ie learned to be a dad), but I still mess up. My wife is an amazing mother, and I still don't come close to her.\n\nYour husband deserved what you said. Best wishes working this out. I suspect that - like me - fatherhood doesn't come easily for your husband. But it sounds like he's trying.

I\u2019m not sure how morning to afternoon is considered all day when it\u2019s only a few hours out of 24.

How would you feel if you paid a bill and then when asked to pay another in which you refused and he says \u201ccongrats, want a trophy for best wife of the year..\u201d? You\u2019re an asshole but for a different reason. When he\u2019s off his job he\u2019s not actually \u201coff\u201d but when you\u2019re \u201coff\u201d from your respective role - you expect to be \u201coff\u201d.

It often gets overlooked or is seen as an easy task. OP could have reacted in a better and calmer way but I completely understand her frustration.

And then there's the ego part, as well as the selfishness. Only a small amount of men gets taught that sex is supposed to be a mutual pleasurable thing, and that it's not all about them alone. It's not for nothing that there's jokes going around about men not being able to find the right spots with women - they've never been taught that women should get pleasure out of sex as well so they don't even make the effort. So they get offended when they're being held accountable, because how dare women expect orgasms as well.\n\nI met a guy once who was convinced the female orgasm was a myth to trick guys into obedience.

I imagine you, on the other hand, get at minimum twice the time to yourself as he does being a SAHM, thus why it would feel so disappointing for him to feel that way after watching the kids for a day.", "YTA - you got to do what you wanted to do all day, i.e. go shopping, and he didn't get to do anything he wanted to do since he was stuck home watching the kids.  So yes he could have helped out and put the kids to bed, but it's also reasonable for him to want some alone time after all day with them.", "He couldn\u2019t even play videogames all day on his day off, honestly should have gotten a trophy", "OP took 1 day a year whereas he gets 4 A MONTH?!", "That's great, but the father in the post never asked for a reward.", "[I'm sorry I can only think of this while reading these types of comments.](https://tenor.com/bg8iV.gif)", "I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s because it\u2019s user base is mostly women in their late twenties and early thirties.
