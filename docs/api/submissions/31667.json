You got both of your kids ready for bed before wanting to do those things for yourself.

People often forget that parenting is a full time job that is UNCOMPENSATED. Your husband works all day and guess what, you do too. Doing housework and taking care of children is a full-time job, you just don\u2019t get paid for it like he does with his job. You put your career life aside so you can raise your kids while he gets to have a career and go to work. So he can put on his big boy pants and put his kids to bed, without complaining. Men do this and then complain that women always win custody of the kids. The public opinion of fathers is terrible due to fathers like this and they ruin it for the good dads. Men need to stop acting like they are babysitting their kids when they watch them or spend time with them. They are YOUR kids.

His sister asked him how they're abandoned if they're with him lol. \nIf he had texted/called me, I would've rushed to finish asap.

You are a stay at home mom, which means the kids are the full time job. \n\nHe gets a day off and on it he stays and watches the kids for you, while you do what you want with your parents.

Her expertise and efforts have been being the stay at home parent.   When you live and work at something everyday for a long time you develop efficiencies, you learn the ins and outs, you learn when to ramp effort up and when you can get down time and rest.

Maybe a night auditor at a hotel/motel nearby. WTH is the matter with so many men? They don't consider SAH mom's a job when it is the most difficult job in the world! When my daughter was little, my husband couldn't help around the house or with our daughter because I was working full time and he was going to school full time. We moved. Then I was going to school full time and he was working full time, so he couldn't help.\n\nHUH???? I left with our daughter not long after...other issues were in on it as usual, but this one stuck in my craw. No one but the stay at home partner knows how tough this job is. Most of the time it is the women that are the ones who take the brunt of it. \n\nTake off for a week and get him to take a week off to cover for you. Then check what shape the house and kids are in when you get back. Don't forget to check the trash for take out containers that served as their dinner. Then set down & have a heart to heart with him.
