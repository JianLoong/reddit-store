I am a very Family and friends focused Person and my closest friends are family to me, that\u2019s why it is and was so important to me that she knows them.\n\nThe whole night I had a feeling that she really didn\u2019t want to be there, she was cold and quiet, looked feed up and gave every one stares. This made me a bit angry since she didn\u2019t have to agree to come, she could have said that she\u2019s uncomfortable with meeting all my friends at once, yet she never really seemed to make an effort to meet them at all. \n\nAttending this gathering was also my best friend (24F), we grew up together since our grandparents are neighbours and both our parents worked full time.\nShe (my best friend) is to be married in June this year and I am her made of honour, my gf doesn\u2019t know of this since their invitations aren\u2019t out yet and she would be my plus one.\nMaybe all of this wouldn\u2019t have happened if my girlfriend wouldn\u2019t have just sat in a corner and glare at every one that wanted to talk to her. \nIt all escalated over the gift my best friend made me, my girlfriend called her a slut and a few more things I don\u2019t want to repeat here.\nThe gist is that \u201chow dare she flirt with me\u201d and to \u201cknow her place\u201d.\nI lost it and am not proud of the words I used but I was angry, why couldn\u2019t she just act nice for 5 hours and suck it up.\nSo I yelled back at her that I was sick of her hypocrisy and why she had such a problem with people that are close to me, then I told her to get out of my house and ignored her texts.\nDuring the following two days basically all her friends asked what happened or called me an AH for kicking her out and letting her drive home at 9 pm. \n\nSo AITA for kicking my gf out of the house for what she said to my best friend?\n\n[Edit]\nSince I saw someone asking\u2026.\nThe gift from my best friend were concert tickets to my favourite artist including a night and extra day stay in the city there to do some sightseeing.\nAlso thanks for the birthday wishes.", "created_utc": 1680352560, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128l49j/aita_for_kicking_my_gf_out_of_the_house_about/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She sounds like an awful person to date. Maybe dump her and find someone not having an emotional (possibly physical) affair and denying it.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a huge red flag.

Did you just say your GF slept in a bed with her male friend and they made you sleep on the floor?????  What more does she have to do to show you she\u2019s a horrible GF?

That would be basically co-signing off on her bad behaviour.", "NTA.   \n\nWas there a tornado coming after 9pm or some other disaster, why is driving home at 9pm an issue?\n\nYour gf is not considerate of you and doesnt care about your feelings.

Relationships are a two way street.  She expects you to be a doormat for her and her relationship dynamics and can't put in one night of \"nice\" with your friends?  On top of that she got jealous of your friend giving you a birthday gift?  Dump her.  Your friends are right.  You worked it out by agreeing to be her doormat.", "NTA Honestly this sounds like it\u2019s better to end. You\u2019d always be the one giving and she the one taking.", "NTA, gf is bat shit crazy.  After a year she doesn\u2019t want to know your friends. There is something wrong with that.  And she\u2019s probably hooking up with that guy.  Who lets their significant other sleep on the floor while they share their bed with a guy.", "NTA\n\nI would have walked away after the 'sleeping' incident.\n\nDon't think she is worth your time. Your friends are nicer than she will ever be.", "NTA what your g/f said to your friend was out of order. And...  \n\n\n>she slept with him in her bed why I slept on a mattress on the floor after he requested it.\n\n\\^ that's weird. Why couldn't HE sleep on the floor? Has she told you why she isn't interested in your friends?", "NTA happy belated birthday. I hope you keep this self respect train going and dump her ass. She sounds extremely self centered and rude. You deserve better", "NTA i hope she is now your Ex or agreed to couple therapy", "NTA.This relationship seems really unbalanced, 1 year together and she doesn't know your friends? Doesn't know your BFF is gonna be married? Yet you know all her friends and even have sleep overs in her male friend house? Besides the apparent lack of communication, the relationship seems filled with jealousy and lack of trust form both sides, it the moment to take a step back and ask if the relationship is worth all these drama, it doesn't in my opinion.", "NTA. Listen, it's time to break up. I'm a lesbian also, and I've been with a woman like your gf. She'll never do anything good for you. Run.", "I've been the best friend in that situation.\n\nThe thing is, a message was being delivered.  He had been on thin ice, was a complete shitshow at teh New Year's Eve bash, and they had basically broken up.\n\nAlso, I had flown halfway across the country, and was staying at my friend's apartment.\n\nAnyway, dude still didn't get the message, took weeks for her to get rid of him.", "I guess because it\u2019s dark and she\u2019s a woman (even though she had her car literally in front of my door).", "I edited and included the gift I got. \nYet I do not quite understand what you mean with history?", "Is there any romantic history or is this out of nowhere?", "Between and my best friend there is no romantic history, I view her as my sister and part of my family.\nThe idea of something romantic grosses me out tbh.", "Your gf doesn't care about you. She didn't meet your friends for over a year, she let someone else sleep in bed with her while you slept elsewhere, she glared at all your friends and was rude....I'm not understanding how you bf is a slut for getting you such a generous and thoughtful gift. I hope this is your soon to be ex gf.", "INFO \nDid you and your GF discuss the bed incident and if yes what was her explanation? Why did she prefer to sleep with her male BF crushing on her than with her GF?", "Wtf did I just read?! Ugh! Get rid of her! \n\nNTA and you deserve better", "OP.  You are a big friend and family oriented person. This relationship is not going to work out. She obviously couldn't care less about your friends or family.\n\nDo you really want to do that in the long term?", "You talk about her not having boundaries but neither do you have any . Like NTA but some self respect is necessary before getting in a relationship", "NTA, your gf sucks just move on and learn a lesson from this :)", "NTA \n\nYou aren't her priority but she should be yours to the extent of snubbing your friends?? No. You deserve a better GF.", "Oh it wasn\u2019t her male friends house, it was her house. \nBut yeah I start to realise that all of that is a bit weird, I guess rose coloured are a thing.", "What? Are women not allowed out after dark now?", "NTA. I would take some time and reevaluate that relationship. Seems like there's a ton of red flags.", "NTA your gf was showing hugely abusive behaviors", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou should have dumped her at the first red flag.", "NTA. \n\nYou and me are similar people lol. My now-ex wouldn't let me see or talk to my friends without causing massive issues, but he could have bonfires and whatever else with his friends so I knew all of them (am still friends with some actually). My ex was also doing actions indicating emotionally cheating: compared me to his female best friend repeatedly in arguments, said hed be happier with her, would lie ab continuing to be friends with her after i issued an ultimatum (stupid of me), kept + attempted to hide dozens of lil notes and cards she'd write for him at work (one in which she called herself the nickname he calls me), etc. In conclusion: Run lol", "Hbd.\n\nNTA, kick her all the way out of your life, she's not an equal partner in the relationship.", "NTA. She jumped to conclusions about your relationship with your friend while she has been sleeping with a male friend of hers.\n\nI would have broken up with her too.", "End this. Relationships really shouldn't be that difficult early on. Also it's clear she fucked him in that bed. No way she's a lesbian.", "NTA\n\nOne gave you the chip on her shoulder and the other gave you a mini-vacation. Which one do you think truly cares about you and deserves space in your life?", "Yes we did discuss this, actually every time when I tried to explain to her why I thought her relationship with him was a bit weird. \nShe always said he would have been uncomfortable and it was just one night.", "Ah, that makes sense. Vaginas explode if they travel too fast while on the night side of the planet. Safety first!", "So what are you?
