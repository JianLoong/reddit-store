His broken laptop is not your problem and your reasons were legitimate anyway.", "NTA. I work with a ton of sensitive data and I will never ever do anything that could jeopardise my job. This is what I say to people who want me to try and bend rules for whatever reason:\n\n\nI am not going to do XYZ for you. I am bound by rules and regulations and I take the privacy of my customers seriously. I like my job and I am not going to do something that puts my job at risk. If requirements aren\u2019t being met I\u2019m not doing it.\n\n\n\nIf your friends still give you shit ask them if they value your ability to have a job. If they keep pressing you drop them because they\u2019re not worth it.\n\nEdit: don\u2019t agree to pay for his courses. He is responsible for having access to a working computer. I also study online and I would never not have a back up. Your work laptop is NOT his backup.", "NTA, at all.  Under normal circumstances you wouldnt be obligated to let him use your personal laptop anyway.  The fact that it\u2019s your work\u2019s proprty?  Heck no.\n\nI am suspicious on why this guy is trying to throw you to the wolves and get everyone else to pressure you over this.  Pay his tuition for him?? Maybe the guy is already on his way to flunking that class a 2nd time and thinks you\u2019re his excuse and paycheck.  You\u2019ve become the scapegoat", "NTA.  Your work  laptop is nor to be used for personal purposes; that's company policy.  Unfortunately,  your friend's computer broke; but your computer was simply unavailable.", "NTA, as an IT guy for a company with pretty strict work laptop rules. Don't share your devices, please just don't.", "NTA\n\nAssuming you are in no way responsible for his laptop breaking I don't see what any of it has to do with you.\n\nWhat would he have done if you and your laptop were not there?\n\nIt is fine to refuse to let anyone else, for any reason, use your work laptop. \n\nYour friends reactions are bizarre but that may be because of the way the question was phrased. How come none of them rushed over with their laptops? Are they on the hook for his tuition because they didn't bring their laptops over? Why are you being held responsible for this guys connection to his uni?", "NTA - When you told your boss that you'd keep the company information confidential, you meant it.", "NTA\n\nIs he aware that you giving him your laptop can lead to your termination or does he just not give a fuck about that?\nHe is not entitled to your stuff especially if you are under strict orders to not \"share\" them by your employer.", "NTA. If an employee at my work shared their laptop they would be fired. It is against our policies and employment contract", "NTA. Work laptops are meant to be for work, especially if you are handling sensitive data. Your flat mate and your friends are extremely unreasonable. Violation of your work protocol could cost you your job, perhaps even some legal problems. Are \"they\" going to pay your lost salary, legal bills? I think not. You did the right thing. For God's sake you don't owe for his tuition, No Way! If he were living alone, how would he have handled the problem? Why didn't he go to the mutual friends, use their laptops?", "NTA - if anything happened to your laptop you could lose your job!!\n\nWhat a pile of entitlement.\n\nPay for his stuff - no chance!!!!", "NTA it makes a lot of sense to say no when it truly is a work only laptop and if he can ask mutual friends for an opinion he can also ask them to borrow a laptop", "NTA\n\nAs you rightly mentioned, it\u2019s your work laptop and contains plenty of sensitive data which should not be accessed by anyone else other than you or your colleagues. You\u2019ll expose yourself and company to legal liability if your friend had used your work laptop. \n\nIt sucks for your friend that his laptop spoilt just before the first test, since it\u2019s a legit reason there is no reason why the school can\u2019t do anything for him. It is actually a common thing, students unable to take the online exams due to connection issue or spoilt laptop/pc. Online schools usually have contingency for such stuff. \n\nIf friend is so concern about the exams, he should have prepared another laptop as backup. He or anyone else can\u2019t be blaming you for his own poor planning. There\u2019s a reason why people bring extra stationeries during written exams, I\u2019ve heard of people prepared backup laptop/pc for important online exams though not the majority.", "NTA. He could have cost you a lot of money by losing your job. You don\u2019t owe him any money either. You need better friends.", "I wouldn't ever even let someone use my personal laptop no less my work laptop. You never even use it for personal use yourself because you know it's wrong and against work policy and I'm sure you would get fired for it if they knew.\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb here and say that since this involves a university student and a bunch of his friends that you guys are all pretty young. Let me congratulate you on your maturity. I have had pretty high standards for my kids ever since they turned 18. I don't give a crap what their friends think or do, but I expect them to realize they're too old to worry about being cool anymore. They need to just do the right thing. Like what you did here. So you don't need your mutual friends to think it was the right choice, whether they agree with you or not you are NTA.", "And when you lost your job over it, was he going to cover all your expenses until you found a new one. I don't think so. NTA. Work devices are for work. Even a fair use policy wouldn't cover a roommate.", "NTA - I thought this was pretty standard knowledge nowadays. If you aren't allowed to do this you can't. It sucks for your friend but its not your fault.", "NTA. Work laptop is for work only. I would seriously reconsider those mutual friends who think you should pay for his tuition. How does he keep failing those subjects though?", "NTA. If it were discovered that you lent your work laptop, which I assume was provided by your work and has specific security software installed to your company, you could be fired and your future in the field you are in greatly compromised. There are a million ways that your roommate could have solved this personal issue on his own for himself. Other people\u2019s problems are not worth compromising your future for. If your friends are thinking YTA, then they don\u2019t understand real world consequences in the world of employment. Roomie could likely have gone to 100 different computers aside from your restricted work laptop.", "As everyone, I think you're NTA.\n\nI thought of one workaround that may have worked: install a virtual machine on your work computer and get him to use it. The only issue it solves is your company not to find out that he'd been using it for personal purposes, so at the end... this is still cheating on the company's rules, and personally I don't find this reasonable either", "NTA\n\nWFH with sensitive data here, it's pretty standard not to let other people access your work laptop. In fact, you could be easily fired for that (eg my contract clearly states I should not allow third parties to use my laptop). Would your friend compensate you for you losing your job?\n\nI mean, imagine if you worked in an actual office, would your friend be mad that you didn't let them come in into the office, past security, to do their stuff on an office desktop? Ridiculous.\n\nAlso, lanhouses? A smartphone (yeah it's not best but you can do most stuff on it)? Other friends?  There are tons of options, and I'm not sure why your friend didn't use those and chose to blame you instead.\n\nThe tuition request makes me wonder if the guy just didn't study and now is trying to throw you under the bus", "NTA. I\u2019d get fired if I let anyone else use my laptop. It\u2019s the property of my work and only certain people have permission to access our system. So this is an easy one - NTA.", "NTA. Even if this was your personal laptop he\u2019s not entitled to use it without your express permission. His poor planning is not your fault.", "IF (and this is a big if) your work laptop worked like mine that the local desktop was basically completely clear and to access anything work related I had to log into a VPN and remote desktop. Meaning friend wouldn't be able to access anything work related without multiple passwords I'm not providing. \n\nIF that's the set up Y T A if it's more willy nilly free access to client info absolutely not, sorry buddy.\n\nETA I also had the type of relationship with bosses that in an extenuating circumstance such as this I'd be forgiven for the transgression so that matters in the ruling too.\n\n\nI'm going with NAH bc you're right to be cautious, they're in the clear if they don't understand the intricacies of confidentiality and work equipment, he's in panic mode and probably not thinking overly rationally in the moment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If his laptop broke and you weren\u2019t there, what would he do. He doesn\u2019t have any other possible way to get on the internet? My college taught us to have a few backup plans for different situations like the power going out, broken computers, wifi issues, etc. Many libraries have computer access and it\u2019s almost always free. That was my backup plan for everything except the power going out, which my backup plan was I always had my laptop charged and I was able to do most things on my IPad if necessary, which could be charged in my car. There are many options depending on where you live and what\u2019s nearby, and he needs to figure out a new option. Poor planning on his part does not constitute an emergency on yours.", "Nta.
