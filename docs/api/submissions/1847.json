She's relying on customers' ignorance of basic sanitary procedures to improve her bottom line. She has no incentive to change & do things correctly unless you or someone else steps in. If you really hesitate to involve the authorities, contact her directly, insist she revert to basic, correct procedures or you absolutely will report her. Identify yourself only as a licensed professional so she knows your opinion carries weight, but she'll have no way of avoiding you or your acquaintances.", "NTA\n\nYou should report them.

What she did was unsafe and unprofessional, there is absolutely nothing wrong with reporting her.", "I wonder how many people beside this wedding had those brushes used on them?", "NTA. I'm not a professional by any stretch. I'm frankly barely competent. Skin sensitivities are a big part of the reason for that. I refuse to share anything that I use on my face with even my own child (she's under puberty and better at applying makeup than I am) We each have our own brushes and applicators as well as separate mascaras and eyeliners because no. Just No.", "NTA. But I\u2019m also a licensed esthetician and while you need a license to be an esthetician, at least where I love, you don\u2019t need any licensing to be a makeup artist.

There is a reason your state requires a license for your profession.  This is a clear and dangerous violation.  Some states would require you to make the report or risk losing your own license.  You would be doing all potential future customers of that person a favor.", "NTA.", "NTA. I was in a wedding a few years back that they brought in someone to do our makeup. I had a bad feeling about it and I wish I had gone with my gut feeling me and and the entire bridal party came down with pink eye. We actually included a picture of all of us in the photo album. And FYI , urgent care won\u2019t give you a group rate  lol.", "NTA, this is a health issue and needs to be reported.", "NTA\n\nShe's breaking rules that are there for a reason. Report her.", "YWBTA, the event has passed and no longer affects you. Just let it go.", "Or from the previous party.  Who's to say she even cleans them between jobs?\n\nNTA this is a hygiene issue not just a personal preference issue", "Nta she'll do it to someone else... clearly", "and that's not OPs problem so why should she care?", "Because some people care about others. Some people do not want to see others get sick when it was preventable.", "Because she is a licensed professional in that industry, knows what the standards of her state are, and feels obligiated to help uphold them?\n\nSounds like good enough reason to me.", "Report this! Give all the details to the licensing board because you know this is a health risk. What happens around weddings and other events that people hire make up artists for? They visit with family (including young and elderly relatives) and travel for honeymoons. Lots of risk for transmission of disease.\n\nBut don't bother the bride with this though. Let her enjoy her memories of the wedding and getting dressed without thinking about this every time she sees her wedding photos. \n\nNTA!", "NTA I would report. Heck my skin is so sensitive if I saw someone using the same things I would just gone to Sephora for a makeover or done my own. Truly disgusting brushes should never be shared. The last wedding I was in had disposal everything, girl sanitized and wiped down everything between girls. Defs appreciate this more now", "You're going to complain about one of the vendors at your friend's wedding therefore you would have to tell your friend. That said, it wasn't your vendor so not really your place to complain. I hear you about the health concerns but I don't think the licensing authority would accept an anonymous complaint so you're back to the same problem of potentially ruining what is a happy memory for your friend because she would need to be contacted as they build a case.", "NTA:  The makeup artist is acting irresponsible.", "NTA: Please, please report her! You never know who she might end up working on and how sick they could really get. I'm immunocompromised and I'm exactly the kind of person who can get really sick when others disregard health and safety regulations. I have to take immunosuppressants so a minor infection on someone else could turn into something major for me. Thank you for noticing this and hopefully doing something!", "Ohhh that's interesting!!! I've been to a lot of weddings and have seen them use the same brushes. Or at least, I thought they did since they didn't have a wide variety of the same brushes. Ok I'm going to have to pay attention more. I really thought that was a standard in the industry and thought that they cleaned after every set or something (I don't wear makeup so I just watched)", "NTA. Report her.", "NTA\n\nShe's a professional MUA she should have extras in her kit. Not using the same brushes on clients is a basic rule of thumb and probably one of the first things she was taught.

But the ONE thing I knew is you never ever share brushes or sponges.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your concern.", "OP is licensed, so they technically do have every right to report the MUA. The MUA community is very cut throat and we do not tolerate those who break the very very first rule we learn - clean your tools and product after and between every use. \n\nIf you can\u2019t follow that basic rule, then you deserve to have your license and reputation taken away.", "(Mostly former) MUA here, NTA at all!! That is so gross, and a great way to get a new disease. My mom used to tell me about how she was in theater, and the entire cast shared one lipstick except her, and they ALL got cold sores, except her. Put the fear of God right into me, I tell you hwhat.", "NTA- brings me back to my days working reception at salons. She knew she'd be doing multiple people and didn't bring extra sponges??? They make single use ones for a reason. The nightmares I'm going to have about tweezers giving people serious eye infections. Horrific.", "NTA", "NTA - that is so gross", "Why didn't you say something? You could have just likely asked for her to use a fresh brush", "NTA at all report her!", "Thats just nasty \ud83e\udd22 \n\nI. N. F. O  did she use any disposable one use applicators for the lip product or mascara? I would lend an eye shadow pallet(think the drug store 3 color ones) and brush I use for the colors when I was in 7th grade at sleep overs with my best friend, but for a mua to do it as her job and gets paid is disgusting. \n\nPlease report her.

My sister had an aspiring make up artist do our make up for her wedding and she had disposable sponges and brushes! She had a nice set of professional brushes that she did not use because she didn\u2019t have cleaner with her. This is make up artist common sense and should be a priority.

By the gods all those germs", "YWNBTA. My sister is a makeup artist and trained properly at a film school. All her equipment is either disposable or, if that's not possible, is cleaned thoroughly between people. It protects the people she does makeup on but it also protects her makeup from contamination. This makeup artist isn't following best practises or even basic hygiene.", "Nta. As a licensed cosmetologist and esthetician reading that made my skin crawl. I worked in the salon on of my instructors owned after I graduated and she fired a artist for doing that and told us that she knew of a client that lost an eye because an artist did that. When you see something like that don't be quiet because they are spreading germs and whatever else. To this day that whole thing has stuck with me.", "Everyone sucks here", "You report the facts, the agency decides what to do. Yes, you report. All you're doing is telling the truth.

If not you, who is going to deal with this disgusting problem? NTA.", "Yes. I have been struggling with scabies. Not because I am unclean or anything like that, but because my sister got a misdiagnosis and spread them to me. I have an autoimmune disorder and cannot get rid of them. Multiple treatments and four doctors and I am still struggling. I have thought about burning my house down and soaking in pure bleach!\n\nNow imagine that some jerk who should know better gives scabies to some poor woman who has lupus etc. \n\nShe would be in the same situation as I am.
