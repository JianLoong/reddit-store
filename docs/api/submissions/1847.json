Everyone has different bacterial combinations living on their skin. Your skin had different cultures than the other bridesmaids' skin.

Ask yourself this, WYBTA if a future customer has a serious health issue due to you not reporting the MUA\u2019s negligence?", "YWNBTA reporting her. She's relying on customers' ignorance of basic sanitary procedures to improve her bottom line. She has no incentive to change & do things correctly unless you or someone else steps in. If you really hesitate to involve the authorities, contact her directly, insist she revert to basic, correct procedures or you absolutely will report her. Identify yourself only as a licensed professional so she knows your opinion carries weight, but she'll have no way of avoiding you or your acquaintances.", "NTA\n\nYou should report them.

That\u2019s just really gross and so so unsanitary\u2026 My aunt had something similar happen during a trial run and she had a huge stye on her eye and burns on her face\u2026 On her wedding day. \n\nShe called me (her trained and licensed niece) last minute to have me do her makeup instead. She was very surprised she watching me toss out every disposable I used right after using and that I had a bin of disposables (mascara wands, lip wands, cotton balls, sponges). \n\nCross contamination is no joke - clean your brushes and sponges and don\u2019t share products!!!

What she did was unsafe and unprofessional, there is absolutely nothing wrong with reporting her.", "I wonder how many people beside this wedding had those brushes used on them?", "NTA. I'm not a professional by any stretch. I'm frankly barely competent. Skin sensitivities are a big part of the reason for that. I refuse to share anything that I use on my face with even my own child (she's under puberty and better at applying makeup than I am) We each have our own brushes and applicators as well as separate mascaras and eyeliners because no. Just No.", "NTA. But I\u2019m also a licensed esthetician and while you need a license to be an esthetician, at least where I love, you don\u2019t need any licensing to be a makeup artist.
