Editing this in early so people see it: The restaurant has it in their menu they don\u2019t do split checks for whatever reason.  I\u2019ve seen that at a few of the fancier places near us. \nWhen the check came one of the new people took it, figured out the tip and then said everyone owes X amount.\nMe and my girlfriend looked at each other and giggled then she took the check and started rallying our total, which obviously was less than what the average was since everyone else drank.\n\nMostly everyone agreed it actually made sense but one of the new couples was extremely offended and said something along the lines of only children bother tallying totals instead of just splitting it evenly.\n\nI said maybe we\u2019re children then but I\u2019m not paying for some randos alcohol when I didn\u2019t even drink. \n\nMy main friend later messaged saying the other couple never wants to hang out with us again and even tho he sees our point maybe we should\u2019ve just split it evenly. \n\nARe we assholes?\n\nLots of edits sorry:  Believe it or not this restaurant actually has a no separate checks clause written on their menu.  It was a fancier steak place.  I have seen this before at a few places. \n\nEdit: posting this because for some reason, my parents agree with them and say they always do an even split when they go out\n\nAlso I don\u2019t think they were being mooches like people are suggesting, as I\u2019m sure they would\u2019ve paid an even amount had me and my girl also been drinking.  It was just a weird social quirk I think.\n\nLast one, to clarify.  We added up our total and said it was what we were paying.  We didn\u2019t calculate everyone else\u2019s totals like some comments seem to think.  We also go out to eat a lot. We know how to calculate a bill. Add the total, overcompensate for tax, (so add 10% in NY), and then 20% on top of that for the tip.  Idk if people in other places tip on the subtotal but everyone I\u2019ve always met tips on the after tax total.", "created_utc": 1673786985, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cj3d0/aita_for_not_wanting_to_do_even_split/", "score": 1708, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Should not have assumed that everyone was on board with splitting evenly. They should have asked. It's very simple.", "INFO: how big was the difference? Admittedly people who nit-pick at the cents part of an amount are childish, but it wouldn't be fair to pay $20 for somebody else.\n\nUnless the margin was less than a couple of dollars, NTA.\nAlso that's why it's way better to ask for separate bills whenever possible.", "NTA. They're acting like children wanting you guys to pay for their drinks.", "NTA. Good riddance to them and anyone else who thinks that you should help pay for their ridiculously priced alcoholic drinks.", "NTA, they sound a bit dramatic and moochy. Why are they not okay with letting people pay for themselves to this degree? It doesn\u2019t take any massive chunk of extra time to tally it up, so I just don\u2019t see the issue, unless they expect to get off easy when others drink less. I wouldn\u2019t wanna pay for someone else\u2019s drinks when I just met them, either.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA, but if I were part of the other couple, I wouldn\u2019t want to do it all again either.", "NTA. Would they have done it if you guys had drank a bunch of alcohol on their dime? I don\u2019t think so.", "NTA. I generally split tabs evenly with good friends, however if my tab was higher and the other parties wanted to split based on cost I would be more than willing. This situation is even more reason to split based on cost since you didn't drink and alcohol generally increases the tab significantly dependent on what people drank and how much. With basically computers in our hands (smart phones) you can easily calculate cost plus tip. You can easily ask the waitress  or waiter to split the tab as well. Its not that hard.", "When I would go out with a group, we would split the bill proportionally-ish.  If there were, non-drinkers, they would pay less. If someone got a burger and someone else got surf and turf, the latter would pay more.", "NTA- If I was the person handed the check for multiple couples. I would totally take something like this into consideration. I usually look - think through if it is close and if there was a couple that was way under I would do it differently. \n\nEasy enough- I would have quickly added up your meals- deducted from the total then divided out the rest. 10 seconds extra work.  \n\nFrequently when we go out with other families ours is less because we have one kid and most our friends have 2 or more.  I make quick work on deciding if the math is worth it or to just split.  For $60 I would do the math.  For $20- eh whatever.", "NTA.

It's much easier.", "NTA We have never evenly split the bill with other couples. We typically don\u2019t drink alcohol at restaurants and order water so our portion of the bill is considerable less than others. A lot of people indulge themselves in alcohol when our to eat and I don\u2019t want to foot part of their bill.", "NTA.\n\nIn my country its not common to split evenly and I personally would never do that for exact the same reasons. Someone will benefit from that, someone will not.", "NTA but I had trouble deciding between that an No AH. It's a tricky situation. I've generally found there's two types of people in sharing meals, those who chronically under-contribute and those who are always willing to contribute extra. Guess who I would want to go out to eat with?\n\nIf you really didn't drink at all, though, maybe you could have asked the server to provide a food tab and bar tab and split the food tab evenly and the bar tab evenly amongst people who had drinks?", "Non-American here: \nWhat the hell is that weird obsession with splitting the bill evenly?\n\nThat doesn't even make sense, unless everybody orders exactly the same. Are y'all afraid of math? Is math impolite?\n\nWhy would you subsidise somebody's meal or let them play for part of yours, unless you invited them outright or they invited you?

These new ones are basically panhandling.", "NTA. Maybe what you said was a bit rude, but after all, it's true.

When someone  doesn't drink we take out their cost and do an even split with the rest. Not difficult and NTA", "NTA\n\nYou said that the other couples paid on average 60 more than you did, that wouldn't have been fair to expect you to split it evenly at all", "Most of the time people suggest this, they acknowledge those who don't drink and split it differently because the difference is obvious. That couple sounds rude and you're probably better off they won't join again. NTA.", "NTA. OP says a few couples so I\u2019m going to imagine 3(the minimum definition of few), so counting OP and GF, let\u2019s say 8 people. High end steak house, maybe $10 per mixed drink? That\u2019s $60 per round of drinks which would add roughly $7.50($15 for the couple) to the non drinkers bill. Average drinks at dinner is around 3 so OP and GF get to pay an extra $45 for other people drinking.", "YTA But for communication issues, not the check splitting. I think either method is fine if all party agrees, and personally prefer separate unless appetizers and bottles for the table have been ordered.\n\nThe issue is that you and your GF shared a look and giggled?! Like, that IS childish behavior. How old actually are you and the rest of this group? If you disagree with what has been proposed, you say, \u201cI\u2019d feel more comfortable splitting it, since we only got a small meal/one round/whatever. Is that okay with everyone?\u201d Or something. I think the person advocating for one bill wouldn\u2019t have been so offended if you/she hadn\u2019t laughed.", "NTA \n\nSame thing as you buying a $10 meal and the other person buying a $50 meal.. you don\u2019t split the difference because you are obviously paying way more than you should. You shouldn\u2019t have to pay for their drinks when you didn\u2019t drink. Just like you shouldn\u2019t have to pay for their $50 meal because it\u2019s obviously unbalanced.", "NTA\n\nSharing the bill evenly is handy because it's quicker and easier than working it out properly.\n\nBut that's only ok if everyone agrees, and that's only likely to happen if either (a) people all spend about the same and/or (b) people are rich enough not to care if they consistently overspend by that amount.\n\nIn my experience it tends to be the ones who can't afford to spend lots are the ones that don't drink and then don't spend as much, and the drinkers often don't realise that others aren't drinking, nor appreciate how much those drinks add up.\n\nSo you're not TA for only paying what you owe. And they're TA for expecting you to subsidise their drink even if they were doing it only for convenience and not to try to get out of paying in full.\n\nYou could have mitigated the problem a little by dropping into conversation as you were ordering, that you're making a note of the cost so that you make sure to pay enough at the end (knowing that \"enough\" also means \"not too much\"). That can warn others that you won't be sharing which can reduce surprise/confusion/embarrassment at paying time. Though that may not be possible to do.\n\nIncidentally, I assume restaurants won't split bills due to the time it takes, especially when people can't then remember what they had. Most restaurants that say No Split Bills only enforce that rule when they're busy (eg Friday/Saturday night) and on other days they'll be ok with it if you ask nicely and come planned with knowledge about who had what.", "NTA for wanting to pay less, but I think you weren't very polite about it. \n\n>Me and my girlfriend looked at each other and giggled then she took the check and started rallying our total,\n\nI think it would've been a bit nicer to say \"hey guys, since we didn't have any alcohol, is it OK if we pay a bit less?\". I think immediately tallying it up - before even mentioning the problem - seems a bit nitpicky and it would've probably been a better compromise to just roughly estimate you owed $10 (or something like that) less.", "NTA for not paying other people's drinks. YTA for giggling about it without discussing it first with the two new couples.", "NTA. There is no way I\u2019m paying for everyone else\u2019s $16 Moscow Mules at a swanky steakhouse (or any overpriced alcoholic beverage), when I\u2019m not even drinking. It\u2019s not the money for me, but the principal. You drink, you pay for your shit. Die mad.", "NTA. Separate bills per couple. The server should have asked.", "NTA. I was actually out to a birthday brunch for a friend and tallied the check per person. One person wasn\u2019t drinking and I felt guilty afterwards where it dawned on me that I should\u2019ve asked their opinion. In the future, let the host and waiter know that you prefer a separate check and maybe tell them to put one of the shared appetizers on it. Also, there is a couple I know that people eventually stopped going out with because they would order expensive tequila and expect an even split when everyone else was drinking pitchers of beer. They\u2019ll all mature a bit more and understand.", "NTA\n\nThey don't want to hang out with you because you won't pay their share of the bill which they tried to stick you with.", "NTA. Fuck that.

They wanted someone else to pay for their drinks.  I would be fine not going out with them ever again.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to pay for everyone\u2019s alcohol either. Next time you\u2019re in that situation, try getting a separate check so that you\u2019re paying only for items that you consume.", "nta.  I order steaks and beer when I go out.  Why should someone else pay that?  The only time I have split a bill like that is when we went out to a diner after a night club... no alchohol.", "NTA they wanted you to pay for their booze. My husband and I drink. We have couple friends who don\u2019t drink. We split the bill proportionate to what we spent. They didn\u2019t have a drink so they pay less. You\u2019re not paying for their booze nor should you. I don\u2019t expect my friends to pay for my booze.", "You\u2019re NTA but I wouldn\u2019t go to dinner with you again either.", "NTA. It\u2019s a tricky social situation to navigate but the other couple\u2019s reaction was way over the top.", "NTA. It's not a big deal, but they made it one. Probably for the best y'all don't hangout with them again, they seem overdramatic and entitled.", "Meh, either way works, depends if you want the hassle or not really.", "NAH. These are different norms. Some people think groups should always split evenly, as arguing over small sums of money is gauche - and if the sums are so large you need to argue about them, you probably should go to cheaper restaurant. I'm one of these people and am always a bit weirded out when someone starts arguing that their appetizer cost 50 cents less than mine, or they drank less, or whatever. Meals are communal and tallying up the bill makes it feel like a business transaction.\n\nHowever, for others it just makes sense for each person to pay what they paid for. That way there's no arguments and everything is clear and simple; it's a little bit of work but there's no implicit rules or unfairness. I imagine it's especially favoured by people who consistently 'get less', such as non-drinkers, and it's favoured by people who prefer clear rules to the more unspoken social norms the world often works on.\n\nNeither is really wrong per se, though it's also culturally dependent (e.g. in Germany you should assume the latter). People will have preferences though. Just like you feel like someone's taking advantage of you, to me you do sound cheap and immature and I probably wouldn't extend a dinner invitation to you.

Usually it makes more sense to split evenly when people more or less have the same total, but if your bill, in this case is $60 less than everyone than it should be itemized.

But if you rarely drink and everyone else in the group drinks, then consistently splitting the check evenly will mean you're always overpaying. That doesn't really feel fair. \n\nI agree that splitting the food and bar tabs separately makes a lot of sense.", "To me, its one of those things where things just even out eventually.  Its why people buy rounds of alcohol.  Yeah, my round may occasionally be more than if I just had 4 of whatever I was drinking, but another day I may spend less. \n\n Also, its not that math is hard, its just often more of a pain to dissect the menu like that.  Like, splitting apps, drinks, dessert, etc.  It can just get to be a pain.  However if you know everyone ate/drank roughly the same amount, its easier to just split.

Why would I pay an additional $15-$25 for someone's drinks when I didn't have any alcohol? Absolutely not.", "You know you aren't the asshole but on some real ass shit....why the FUCK is doing this when going out even still a thing????? Just pay for your own damn bill or see what you each racked up and throw that amount in the pot + a tip of your choosing if you're ok with it all being on one check. I seriously only see check splitting as a way to get out of paying a little bit of your bill.", "YTA- stop being childish and split the check evenly. Weird hill to die on.", "Totally agree. There were a number of years where my budget was very tight and when I went out with friends, I tried to spend very little, which could be sunk by an even split of the tab. Now I have the budget to splurge and my share of the tab is likely to be pretty high. \n\nI ALWAYS vote for paying more myself unless our costs are fairly even. Even if someone who didn't have a lot says it's okay to split evenly, I try to make it up by offering to take care of more of the tip or something else.

So it's easier to just split the bill \"x\" ways than figure out who had what, add in tax, and then add in tip. \n\nBasically eveywhere else the tax is included in the price of the dish and you don't tip for service because that is included in the price of the dish, too.", "This is fair I just don\u2019t take well to being insulted first", "NTA at all. In the future, I suggest you do what I do. Go to the restroom and find the server away from the table and ask them to put everything you and your SO ordered onto a separate bill for this evening.

Some people really hate the detail of tallying up each item though and see it as \u201ccheap\u201d or focusing more on the bill than the time together. I\u2019ve been the person who spent way less and the person who has spent more in a meal and found that an easy way to solve the issue, but still keep the split fairly simple is to evenly split the cost of the meal and then bigger spenders split the cost of the tip.

I got nothing then. At least you won't ever have to see those jerks anymore.", "Agreed, I also don\u2019t think they were intentionally trying to be moochers. It was a large group, they probably really weren\u2019t paying attention to what everyone was ordering/drinking, and splitting a check evenly is probably what they are used to with other friend/family groups.  That\u2019s how most people I know do it (or we just take turns picking up the whole check). Assuming everyone is fine with it, and the restaurant is a price range that is comfortable for everyone, it\u2019s so much easier and the server should get a good tip and not shorted because someone didn\u2019t calculate correctly.  \n\nThere are a lot of exceptions, work outings, one person picking an expensive restaurant, people of different ages/tax brackets, etc. It certainly doesn\u2019t work all of the time.\n\nSo, OP is NTA for asking for separate checks. They shouldn\u2019t have to subsidize someone else\u2019s meal if they don\u2019t want to.  (Although it is a bit weird that they giggled about it?) The other couple was rude to freak out.

Means everyone can have whatever they want, no guilt or taking advantage or need to balance.", "In general, in my experience, it's pretty uncommon to have a big imbalance between the different bills, for a couple different reasons. \nThe main form of informal meal-based social outing with many people, in Italy, is going to a pizzeria. Sushi restaurants and steakhouses are popular too but not remotely as much as pizzerie. So there probably won't be any crazy expensive items on the menu and everyone will kind of order the same thing, a pizza or some other dish with a drink and maybe a dessert. Sometimes you go for fixed price options like all you can eat pizza which is even easier for splitting the bill evenly, those are incredibly common to especially among young people. You don't normally get appetizers, multiple dishes etc. when you're in a group with other people, maybe you get an appetizer for the table or you go for aperitivo beforehand. \n\nWe also tend not to order cocktails or hard drinks with meals. It's either water, a soft drink, beer, or a glass of wine, plus if everyone is drinking an alcoholic beverage usually you also get a couple water bottles for the table. So even if I'm drinking a Coca Cola and the person next to me got a beer the difference is not gonna be that crazy. And I don't drink so I've definitely been to dinners where everyone else ordered beer and I drank water. At worst I end up spending like 5-7\u20ac more than I would have paying only for my stuff. \n\nAs for the worrying about money thing, I definitely do not come from wealth, and I'm a uni student so I'm not around many wealthy people who don't need to worry about money lol. I don't really wanna get into it but I think that in the States, poverty and deep financial insecurity is much more of a problem than it is here. I think it is a mix between tighter family units, stricter labour laws, a stronger welfare system, and cultural differences, such as the fact that it's more common to own your home rather than rent. I also think that the average Italian leads a more frugal life than the average American when it comes to things like eating out, buying appliances,  \ncars, hobbies etc.\nThis means that luckily most people can live \"normally\" without having huge financial issues (although poverty still exists of course) and that imo translates to a different attitude about money.", "The OP said the other couple was \u2018extremely offended\u2019 and said only children tally totals. Seems like freaking out to me, but there is definitely room for interpretation.  To me that makes them rude and inappropriate, but I still don\u2019t think they were intentionally trying to take advantage of anyone. \n\nBut I totally agree with you that it seems like two couples that are incompatible dining partners.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned from this thread is that there are people who always want to make sure they pay only for what they consume (a subset of this group thinks anyone who suggests otherwise is scammer). Other people don\u2019t really care if they pay +/- the actual cost because it all works out eventually and it\u2019s more about the company/act of being out together.  There is nothing wrong with either method, it\u2019s what works best for each person.", "Southern US as well (In South Carolina), and NTA", "Yeah, that also works. I'm fine with either system, but I prefer to roughly estimate how much I owe (5.95 + 3* 2.50 + 18.30 means I pay 35ish) rather than work it out exactly.

Doesn't change the fact that certain practices are more common in certain cultures than in others. \nI mean, splitting the bill evenly is literally called \"paying the Roman way\" in Italian.", "No problem. \nI also wanna add that these are just personal observations on the way I believe American and Italian culture differ and I don't wanna offend anyone or imply that we all act and feel the same.", "I agree. \n\nWhat if OP & their spouse ordered the most expensive items in the menu & wanted to split it evenly when everyone else got the average meal?

It wouldn\u2019t make sense to pay the same as someone who ate less!", "Exactly. When I buy a round of drinks, sometimes I\u2019m drinking a $5 can of cider and someone else is drinking a $12 cocktail. I\u2019m not going to quibble over the difference, I\u2019m just going to buy the round. And the next time someone buys a round, they\u2019ll buy whatever I\u2019m drinking, and in the long run who gives a shit if someone came out $5 ahead.\n\nEspecially in group dinner situations, there are often shared appetizers, shared bottles of wine, or other things for the table, and it seems silly to try to itemize everything.\n\nIf one couple always insisted on calculating out exactly what they ate/drank, I wouldn\u2019t call them children.

Otherwise you\u2019re going to have some people deciding to leave 15% before taxes, or forgetting taxes altogether, or miscalculating their share of a shared app, and if everyone figures their part at even $10 less than it really should be, then either the person who actually takes the bill and leaves a 20% tip ends up paying way more than their share, or the server ends up with way less of a tip than they should have.", ">I\u2019d be fine with someone saying, \u201coh, we didn\u2019t drink so can we just throw in $80 for our share of the food and tip\u201d or whatever would approximately cover the difference.
