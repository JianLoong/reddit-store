I don't see a problem with what you did, but I could see why someone else might. Plus this is a really tense time for her!\n\nBut, you need to bite the bullet and make your wife comfortable here. She's probably in a lot of pain, she's scared at the thought of surgery, etc. Apologize and then ask her directly what you can do to help her.

I saw the comment where you're fine being off from work. You were just genuinely concerned and didn't want to worry her before you called. It would be worth explaining this to her. It's also fair to be concerned, I was actually born late and if my mom hasn't had me within 2 days after I was born, they were going to induce labor (I was 2 weeks late). Just try explaining to her that you were worried because of how stressed she was and so you called the midwives for advice on how to help her without saying anything because you didn't want to stress her more.", "NTA, you are taking care of your partner who is in the midst of a huge life change.  They will thank you in the long run.", "It honestly sounds like you were seeking advice for yourself rather than your wife. It's perfectly reasonable to talk to a health professional about the issues you are facing and how best to deal with them. This is similar to talking about your marital issues with a psychologist.

I got upset and didn\u2019t even know why I was upset at times. Pregnancy is hard and being worried about being induced/ C-section is hard.

I'm not sure why people think you're TA. I have several friends and family who get extremely nervous with anything that has to do with doctors and hospitals, so it's better if someone else makes the appointments for them or talks to their doctors so they can get a check-up. I'm not sure if that's what you thought was the case for your wife, but I think you had good intentions. The execution is what failed, and now you know you shouldn't do that again. I hope everything goes well with your wife and the delivery.", "You know what's a great way to keep someone from stressing? Not going behind their back and speaking to their midwife about them then having the midwife lie to them for your benefit.
