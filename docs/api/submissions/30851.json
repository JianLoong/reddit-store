Because of that whenever we have our weekly dinners with my husband side of the family my MIL will make a separate dish for my daughter that she know she will like (my daughter hate most spices so most of the time no one else like her food so there\u2019s no need to make it a dish for everyone).\n\nTwo days ago we had our dinner and we were running a little late because it has been a bad day for my daughter and we were both irritated at that point.\n\nWhen we got there I saw my nephew (15) eating my daughter food (I knew it was hers since she was having a completely different dish than everyone else and my MIL had told me what it was, and send me a picture to show my daughter since it was a new recipe she was trying) my daughter also saw it and starerei bawling, it was a very hard day for her already and I guess this was what finally broke her, everyone came running into the kitchen to see what was happening and when mu SIL saw what her son was doing she immediately scolded him but the damage was done, I gave my daughter to my husband and asked to wait for me in the car, once they left I snapped at my nephew that just because his parents never taught him to shut his mouth for a little while doesn\u2019t mean he can just eat whatever he wants, he knew it was my daughter food, he knew how she is about food and he still chose to eat it. I gave my SIL a hard look and left.\n\nEveryone had been bombing the family group chat fighting over who is on the wrong \n\nEdit; I see it coming up a lot, by my SIL scolding my nephew I meant that she pointed at my daughter\u2019s food, told him not to that next time since it\u2019s his cousin food and lightly slapped his wrist like he\u2019s a five years old.

It was thoughtless and careless. Sometimes it takes someone that is not his mom to make it more clear how awful what he did was.\n\nOn the other hand, as her parent, you need to start taking more responsibility.

Your 15-year-old nephew absolutely knew better, and was hoping you all would be too late to catch him in the act. He might resent her for having \"special food,\" even.\n\nIf you haven't looked into ARFID, please do. Your daughter definitely fits the profile. \n\nIf your SIL had seriously taken your nephew to task for an obvious overstep like this, then you would be the AH, but the fact that he's 15 and she's slapping his wrist for trying to starve his obviously unwell younger cousin is infuriating. That \"boys will be boys\" attitude will start reaping far harsher consequences than a dressing-down from a reasonably upset aunt. \n\nYou may want to dig further to find out whether your SIL is characterizing your daughter as a \"spoiled brat\" who \"got what was coming to her\" with her \"special meals from Grandma,\" because the way she acted actually makes it look as if she actually approved of what he did. This probably didn't come out of nowhere, and is probably deeper than \"he got hungry.\"\n\nAdditionally, getting your daughter evaluated for ARFID (as well as autism and sensory processing disorder) will help make clear that the separate meal isn't spoiling, but a real medical necessity. It won't convince the ableists who would write your daughter off as a \"coddled brat\" or other crap, but for those who don't understand the issues she faces, having a name and a long-term treatment plan may make getting support easier.", "YTA you can be upset about the food without being a complete asshole to a kid.", "I dont get all these \u201cYTA\u201d comments.\nYour nephew is 15\u2026not 8, that is MORE than old enough to know NOT to eat food that isnt yours.\nNTA Op, normally i don\u2019t advocate for yelling at someone else\u2019s child, but given the way his mother reacted it\u2019s clear somebody had to.\nThe only way i could MAYBE see \u201cESH\u201d would be if nobody told your nephew the food was specifically for your daughter.", "YTA.

It sounds like you let your emotions drive that day and that you weren't being very intentional with your actions. It's not like this was a mistake that couldn't be rectified. New food could have been made. You would rather hurt somebody to punish them. He could have just been easily talked to and told what a burden it would cause if he did this again. Like you said the damage was already done so you already needed to figure out a new meal plan for her.", "YTA, dear god, get a grip. Also, there\u2019s a lot you left out of this story. Where was everyone else when your nephew ate the food? He just sneaked into the kitchen before dinner to help himself to a snack of your special set aside food? Which you claim is less appealing than the rest of the meal?

If you were running late, then likely dinner was delayed, and the boy was hungry. Yes, he should have waited, but if there was a single dished up meal and he was hungry, well, teenagers make poor decisions. He probably doesn't understand how severe the eating issue with your daughter is, and may have thought that she was getting a kid meal rather than an important dietary exception. He probably assumed that a meal was a meal, so why not eat now rather than wait. \nTeenagers have a lot to learn. They are inherently self centred and selfish. It is also likely that nobody has thought to explain your daughter's dietary struggles to him, as it would not normally be something he needs to understand. \nSo he grabbed some bites of a dish he didn't understand needed to be kept exactly as it was for your daughter. His Mum told him off, probably planning to explain more thoroughly why the meal was so important later, in private. \nYou then weighed in, and shouted at him, insulting his parenting. \nYour daughter saw the missing meal and had a melt down. \nIt all got emotionally messy. \nI think my conclusion is ESH but it is not too late to have a calm situation and communicate the reason for the high emotions. \nHopefully your SIL will have that conversation with her son, so that he not only knows that he was wrong, but also Why that one particular meal was so important that so many adults got angry. This is the key to him reflecting and learning to leave future meals alone not just because he doesn't want to be told off, but also because he understands why your daughter needs specially prepared meals. \nHopefully you and your SIL can apologise to each other for shouting and agree that you were both upset about the teenager eating the special meal. \nHopefully you will all resolve things so that future family meals can still happen.", "Yta to the point that I'm not going to bother explaining", "Why are you insulting and yelling at a child that isn't yours?\n\nAnd more importantly:\nWhy hasn't your daughter seen a specialist yet if eating causes her so much discomfort?\n\nYTA.", "This happened to me when my nephew ate all my daughters food at a restaurant.

Your daughter needs that food as an accomodation for her needs. I would absolutely look up ARFID and reach out to a Dr about it as other commenters have suggested. I have spent most of my life being made fun of and having eyes rolled at me for the things I can't eat because they will literally make me vomit, or the fact I'll only eat out at certain places because I can't handle the risk of my safe foods potentially being different to what I expect. I've had the same reaction as your daughter had many a time when I was expecting a safe food only to find out I couldn't have it for some reason, usually on a very bad day like your daughter was happening and it's just so overwhelming.

He definitely knew he shouldn't have done it, and he did it anyway. \n\nThat said, you responded badly, too. You came into the situation upset from kid meltdowns, and it got worse from there. Scolding the kid and leaving would have been one thing. That isn't what you did. You decided to make snotty comments at your SIL, rather than direct instruction to the teen, and that wasn't helpful or necessary.", "Gentles ESH. It sound like accommodating your daughter is very hard and it is awful that your nephew took the only option for her knowingly but that doesn\u2019t excuse you blowing up at him. His mother was already taking care of it and it sounds like you needed to step away and come back with a clear mind. It sounds like your family members take your daughters condition quite seriously (as they should) so I think it would\u2019ve been best to let your SIL address things and if there were to be a repeat incident that is when you can *calmly* intervene.\nOn a related note, I would really suggest getting your daughter screened for conditions like arfid like other commenters have suggested. That may be something you\u2019ve already looked into but with afab individuals it is more difficult to get any diagnosis with a connection to autism due to a misconception that autism is rare in females, so it may be worth a second opinion. Arfid is separate from autism but arfid is most commonly seen in patients with neurodivergence.", "NTA and leave the family group chat!!!! Every reddit poster has that line about either the whole family blowing up their phone OR fighting about it on the fgc.

Imagine seeing a toddler at a restaurant eating a plate of ketchup with a side of solid butter because the doctor said to let her do it. This is what my stepmom said I was eating on her first date with my dad (and me, I guess).\n\nBut these puking incidents happen while the stuff is still in our mouths. It is some kind of texture aversion for me, and if it's combined with an awful taste it is the worst. And this is why I have trouble with trying new foods and usually start with a sniff and then a small touch with the tongue to check the texture first. I have gotten it under control now to where if I feel something unappealing in my mouth I get a full body shudder and try to get it out of my mouth asap like into a napkin or whatever. \n\nI might agree with \"picky eaters don't puke\" if the kid is puking after swallowing the food or if it happens post-meal. Then maybe it is an allergy or some kind of condition.\n\nI am diagnosed adhd and personally think I'm probably autistic too or maybe \"instead,\" but my therapist hasn't decided yet, but this is probably my root issue.

Just fix it.", ">So SIL is supposed to know in advance that her kid is gonna do something like this?\n\nIf she had taught him the most basic of manners, he would not eat food that he knew was someone else\u2019s. Don\u2019t touch what\u2019s not yours should not be a new lesson at 15. \n\n>He was doing it in the kitchen, she didn't realise until OPs kid got upset and everyone went to see what was going on.\n\nShe didn\u2019t realise her kid was eating someone\u2019s food and not his own plate? As in everyone else sat down to dinner at the dinner table and her kid wasn\u2019t there and she had no clue? That\u2019s still a her bad parenting issue isn\u2019t it? \n\n\n>She likely would've done something about it later, and just didn't want to do it in front of everyone (because how would that help the situation?).\n\nHow does later help the hungry child who\u2019s food had been stolen? Now is the time to punish her teenager, specifically by making do the reasonable thing and make up for the food by remaking the plate he\u2019d eaten so the child he stole food from could eat. Again a parenting problem.", "I mean, if there's a food in every single plate and in one is different don't you just ask why? And often it's because its a special order or something like that, and if you aren't specified that that is your plate it's probably not yours", "At the same time OP\u2019s daughter having different food from everyone else isn\u2019t new. Hopefully his mom reminded him that he should ask if he\u2019s not sure next time. Otherwise it will be seen as intentionally causing issues for OP\u2019s daughter.", "I feel like this was asked and answered already...", "Oh but I do see your point, and my reply is that it\u2019s ridiculous and overdramatic. Eating someone\u2019s food, even on purpose, is not a \u201cgateway crime\u201d to committing felony theft. Maybe it was thoughtless, maybe it was selfish, but it was hardly sociopath behavior.", "PLEASE-\nEating someone\u2019s food is comparable to car theft!? Get a fucking grip", "Taking a piece of food isn\u2019t stealing a car\u2026 you are intentionally sensationalizing the situation to win an argument.", "Come on, this is absolutely not an apt comparison.", "Eating someone\u2019s Mac and cheese or whatever is realistically the same to you as stealing a car? Yikes.", "Where did I say that was okay?", "So just a question whats your opinion on the 15 year old who visibly seen 1 different plate of food than literally everything everyone else was having and thought \"Im going to eat that without asking or questioning first\" and not just focus on the literal 5 year old that clearly has food issues and sensitivity if she is literally vomiting and taking panic attacks?\nIf you're gonna assume 1 is spoiled for having food aversions then look at the older one first that literally thought it was ok to eat the one plate of food that differed from everything else.\n\nI get it he's a kid too but by that age some common sense should be there, but I'm also curious was he also purposely eating this plate out of sight of everyone because he knew he shouldn't have been?\n Realistically I would like to assume that some adults should have been present to witness this and either stop it before it happened or stop it before OP arrived with her child.\n\nIt's just a shitty situation for everyone involved.", "ARFID.  Look it up and stop being an asshole.", "Touche!!\n \nAt least we all know we aren't doctors right?\n\nI'm glad you have a sense of humor\n\nI apologize for getting a bit heated, I have ARFID myself so this topic is a sensitive one for me, and I probably came off stronger than I meant to", "The Edit.", "He should have been forced to apologize to his younger cousin. I never once said OP was right in how they acted. I\u2019m saying the SiL didn\u2019t do enough. Need to stop treating teenagers like kids. They aren\u2019t kids anymore. They need to take responsibility when they do something wrong.", "Should have made him apologize in front of everyone. At least then the lesson would stick longer then in one ear and out the other.", "Exactly. I don't understand everyone siding with someone who would insult a kid like that. There's telling him off and then there's just being an insulting AH because you're frustrated about something else and want someone to take it out on.", "\"When my SIL saw what her son was doing she immediately scolded him\"", "Children with sensory disorders, which it sounds like this child is struggling with, shouldn\u2019t be sent out to the car so mummy can have a go at her nephew. She should have taken her daughter aside, calmed her down or just been there for her. And judging by the tone of this post, she probably came out to the car in a rage. Never said she was a bad mum and honestly don\u2019t think that, but I think her temper won over her better judgement. The entire purpose of this sub is judge behaviour at the end of the day.", "How do you know she didn't teach him that, and he just ignored her? \n\nAnd no, a *fifteen year old* not being at the dinner table isn't a parenting issue lmao. SIL probably assumed he was going to the toilet or something. \n\nI don't know, maybe there wasn't time? OP didn't specify what time it was or anything, just that they were late. Maybe she planned to ground him or something, but wanted to discuss it with his other parent first.\n\nIt's not as much of a parenting problem as you think it is.", "No, it hasn\u2019t. All you\u2019ve said is that she should act like an adult and control herself. What does that mean to you, exactly? She didn\u2019t go on a tirade and scream in his face. She didn\u2019t threaten or engage in violence. She didn\u2019t cuss him out or call him names. She told him not to do stupid shit that hurts her daughter.

At the same time: you can force someone to say sorry but you can't force someone to feel sorry.", "I disagree.

Especially if they are saying it to the one harmed and not to their own parent or to the parent of that child.", "Who knows? We don't. Nor does OP because they didn't ask, they just insulted their nephew, got passive aggressive with SIL (DIDN'T EVEN TALK TO HER) and then left.", "How do you know how the SIL really punished him?\n\nThe OP is definitely not a reliable narrator, so her description of what the SIL said to the nephew can\u2019t really be trusted.", "So you think OP handled the situation wrong because all she did was yell at him too.", "My approach comes from the perspective that education is the only sustainable way to help people improve. As a teacher I study brain development. Frontal lobes aren't connected until people are around 21, so the large majority of teens do things without an acute understanding of consequences.\n\n  \nI've never felt truly sorry when I was forced to say it, so I'm curious. Have you been forced to apologise out of fear and actually feel sorry?", "I\u2019m going on what the edit was and the fact that the child was removed. How can you say they are unreliable when they are the only thing here. The SiL didn\u2019t make a account, the teenager isn\u2019t here. I\u2019m just said multiple times on how I would have made the teen apologize to his younger cousin for stealing her share of the food that Grandma made for her special.", "What punishment did you want? Slapped, stabbed?", "Honestly, YES. He should have been made to apologize. The lesson would have stuck a whole lot harder.", "Forced out of fear, yes. Did I mean it at the time? Nope, not one bit. Felt like that switch was right there to whack me if I didn\u2019t say the right words. But that kept rolling over in my head and it took a couple days and bantering with friends to get my Ah ha moment. Then I stood up like a stupid teen I was and gave a real apology, the girl I had hurt the feelings of seemed to really appreciate that I was giving a real apology then."]}
