Because of that whenever we have our weekly dinners with my husband side of the family my MIL will make a separate dish for my daughter that she know she will like (my daughter hate most spices so most of the time no one else like her food so there\u2019s no need to make it a dish for everyone).\n\nTwo days ago we had our dinner and we were running a little late because it has been a bad day for my daughter and we were both irritated at that point.\n\nWhen we got there I saw my nephew (15) eating my daughter food (I knew it was hers since she was having a completely different dish than everyone else and my MIL had told me what it was, and send me a picture to show my daughter since it was a new recipe she was trying) my daughter also saw it and starerei bawling, it was a very hard day for her already and I guess this was what finally broke her, everyone came running into the kitchen to see what was happening and when mu SIL saw what her son was doing she immediately scolded him but the damage was done, I gave my daughter to my husband and asked to wait for me in the car, once they left I snapped at my nephew that just because his parents never taught him to shut his mouth for a little while doesn\u2019t mean he can just eat whatever he wants, he knew it was my daughter food, he knew how she is about food and he still chose to eat it. I gave my SIL a hard look and left.\n\nEveryone had been bombing the family group chat fighting over who is on the wrong \n\nEdit; I see it coming up a lot, by my SIL scolding my nephew I meant that she pointed at my daughter\u2019s food, told him not to that next time since it\u2019s his cousin food and lightly slapped his wrist like he\u2019s a five years old.

Period.\n\nEta some clarification \n\nTbh;  it doesn't really matter if picky eaters ARE choosing to be picky, or not though\n\nWhatever their reason for being picky is their own, and none of anyone else's business\n\nI know I was doubling down a lot on my stance in earlier comments about how picky eaters choose to be picky, blah blah blah\n\nI'm not contradicting myself so much as having taken a step away and come back with a cooler head and come to the conclusion that it doesn't matter whether people are picky due to medical reasons, or choice\n\nIf people are picky, it's for a reason, and they don't owe you an explanation \n\nIf they want to eat their chicken tenders and fries at 30, let them, because let's be honest here\n\nChicken tenders and fries are tasty at any age", "If your daughter has panic attacks and throws up if she doesn\u2019t have the right food, maybe family dinners aren\u2019t the best activity?

As someone with a ton of food issues I\u2019d love to have quality time with my family for non-food events but so much socializing is centered on food. Why can\u2019t we be inclusive and switch up activities?", "YTA. Your sil didn\u2019t let it go. She said something!

Not sure why you, as an adult, feel it\u2019s even remotely okay to scream at a child. Did your nephew even know that he wasn\u2019t supposed to eat that food? Was there none left for your daughter? Even so, it\u2019s not your nephew\u2019s problem that you guys were having a bad day.

Did he need correction? Absolutely. Did you need to insult him and his character to do so? Absolutely not. 15 year olds don\u2019t make good decisions - that part of their brain hasn\u2019t finished development. Being verbally abusive in response doesn\u2019t help that.", "NTA. He's 15, he's old enough and he knew exactly what he was doing. It's perfectly ok for you to point out that him being a selfish little A with no regards for other people's feelings crosses lines.

He sound totally unaware that in three years he will be a legal adult, with adult responsibilities. That kind of careless attitude toward others needed to be addressed. It was THEFT. It was thoughtless and careless. Sometimes it takes someone that is not his mom to make it more clear how awful what he did was.\n\nOn the other hand, as her parent, you need to start taking more responsibility. Start packing your daughter her own meals. They don't have to be complex, they can be a grilled cheese, with some fried veggie sticks or a little salad on the side. Whatever is the least work, and the easiest to transport and clean up.", "YTA and get your daughter into therapy. Your SIL dealt with her son, it was not your place to butt in.

Going off because you were having a bad day is unacceptable. There was no reason for it. You did it because you felt you could. SIL had it handled and she didn't ask for the village to step in. You also made disparaging comments about SIL's parenting despite her handling it. \n\nWould it be okay if she commented on your parenting? Told you off for bringing an irritable child to dinner?

Yelling at someone else\u2019s kid is messed up. I have a 15 year old and I would lose my shit if my sister spoke to my kid that way. Let your sister deal with her old child and you deal with your child. Side note, enabling the picky eating isn\u2019t going to do anyone any favors in the long run. Make sure you keep offering your child different foods even if you think she won\u2019t eat them. She will surprise you eventually.\n\nEdit: if you don\u2019t think the picky eating is just that, you should get her checked out by a doctor.

It is very kind of your MIL to make a special meal for your daughter. It's unfortunate that your daughter was having a hard day and that she has food issues. You need to understand, however, that your daughter isn't the center of everyone's universe, just yours (as it should be). You were rude and behaved badly. It wasn't your place to yell at your nephew.", "If your daughter is so picky that she pukes, there could very well be something physically wrong. \n\nYTA ish", "[deleted]", "NTA. Your 15-year-old nephew absolutely knew better, and was hoping you all would be too late to catch him in the act. He might resent her for having \"special food,\" even.\n\nIf you haven't looked into ARFID, please do. Your daughter definitely fits the profile. \n\nIf your SIL had seriously taken your nephew to task for an obvious overstep like this, then you would be the AH, but the fact that he's 15 and she's slapping his wrist for trying to starve his obviously unwell younger cousin is infuriating. That \"boys will be boys\" attitude will start reaping far harsher consequences than a dressing-down from a reasonably upset aunt. \n\nYou may want to dig further to find out whether your SIL is characterizing your daughter as a \"spoiled brat\" who \"got what was coming to her\" with her \"special meals from Grandma,\" because the way she acted actually makes it look as if she actually approved of what he did. This probably didn't come out of nowhere, and is probably deeper than \"he got hungry.\"\n\nAdditionally, getting your daughter evaluated for ARFID (as well as autism and sensory processing disorder) will help make clear that the separate meal isn't spoiling, but a real medical necessity. It won't convince the ableists who would write your daughter off as a \"coddled brat\" or other crap, but for those who don't understand the issues she faces, having a name and a long-term treatment plan may make getting support easier.", "YTA you can be upset about the food without being a complete asshole to a kid.", "[deleted]", "YTA. It's not your place to go in and scold someone else's kid. And the way you said it was insulting too, you implied his parents didn't parent him that properly.  He ate the wrong dish.

It sounds like you let your emotions drive that day and that you weren't being very intentional with your actions. It's not like this was a mistake that couldn't be rectified. New food could have been made. You would rather hurt somebody to punish them. He could have just been easily talked to and told what a burden it would cause if he did this again. Like you said the damage was already done so you already needed to figure out a new meal plan for her.", "YTA, dear god, get a grip. Also, there\u2019s a lot you left out of this story. Where was everyone else when your nephew ate the food? He just sneaked into the kitchen before dinner to help himself to a snack of your special set aside food? Which you claim is less appealing than the rest of the meal? On that point: your daughter gags and panics if she has to eat something she doesn\u2019t like, but your mother in law is trying out a new recipe for her separate meal? None of this passes the sniff test.", "Your daughter has ARFID. YTA, shouting at a child bc you\u2019re \u2018having a bad day\u2019 is awful", "I am torn between e s h and n a h. If you were running late, then likely dinner was delayed, and the boy was hungry. Yes, he should have waited, but if there was a single dished up meal and he was hungry, well, teenagers make poor decisions. He probably doesn't understand how severe the eating issue with your daughter is, and may have thought that she was getting a kid meal rather than an important dietary exception. He probably assumed that a meal was a meal, so why not eat now rather than wait. \nTeenagers have a lot to learn. They are inherently self centred and selfish. It is also likely that nobody has thought to explain your daughter's dietary struggles to him, as it would not normally be something he needs to understand. \nSo he grabbed some bites of a dish he didn't understand needed to be kept exactly as it was for your daughter. His Mum told him off, probably planning to explain more thoroughly why the meal was so important later, in private. \nYou then weighed in, and shouted at him, insulting his parenting. \nYour daughter saw the missing meal and had a melt down. \nIt all got emotionally messy. \nI think my conclusion is ESH but it is not too late to have a calm situation and communicate the reason for the high emotions. \nHopefully your SIL will have that conversation with her son, so that he not only knows that he was wrong, but also Why that one particular meal was so important that so many adults got angry. This is the key to him reflecting and learning to leave future meals alone not just because he doesn't want to be told off, but also because he understands why your daughter needs specially prepared meals. \nHopefully you and your SIL can apologise to each other for shouting and agree that you were both upset about the teenager eating the special meal. \nHopefully you will all resolve things so that future family meals can still happen.", "Yta to the point that I'm not going to bother explaining", "Why are you insulting and yelling at a child that isn't yours?\n\nAnd more importantly:\nWhy hasn't your daughter seen a specialist yet if eating causes her so much discomfort?\n\nYTA.", "This happened to me when my nephew ate all my daughters food at a restaurant.

I have spent most of my life being made fun of and having eyes rolled at me for the things I can't eat because they will literally make me vomit, or the fact I'll only eat out at certain places because I can't handle the risk of my safe foods potentially being different to what I expect. I've had the same reaction as your daughter had many a time when I was expecting a safe food only to find out I couldn't have it for some reason, usually on a very bad day like your daughter was happening and it's just so overwhelming.

It sounds like your family members take your daughters condition quite seriously (as they should) so I think it would\u2019ve been best to let your SIL address things and if there were to be a repeat incident that is when you can *calmly* intervene.\nOn a related note, I would really suggest getting your daughter screened for conditions like arfid like other commenters have suggested. That may be something you\u2019ve already looked into but with afab individuals it is more difficult to get any diagnosis with a connection to autism due to a misconception that autism is rare in females, so it may be worth a second opinion.

Best case scenario, the 6 year old has to watch everyone else eat and get something cooked after the fact. He's not 5, he's 15. Closer to an adult than the 6 year is to being a newborn. A little slap on the wrist, being told he's naughty and having a conversation later doesn't solve the issue of him being a malicious little AH does it?

Even if she was too lenient though, you should have taken that up with her later, quietly. It's not your place to scold someone else's kid, unless you've been made responsible for them (e.g. you're teaching their class, you're babysitting, etc). Take it up with the parent, not with the kid, and certainly not when you're full of fire in the moment.", "YTA. YTA. YTA. Seriously there are so many things wrong with this story.\n1. It\u2019s pretty clear that nephew wasn\u2019t aware that was your daughters food.\n2. Why is your daughter crying over that? Kids can feel their emotions but a good parent would redirect their emotions and find a solution. I.e get her favourite take out.\n3. How dare you not only discipline but yell at another persons child. SIL had dealt with the situation in public. What did you want her to do in a public setting scream and yell at her child? I hope you don\u2019t do that to your child. \n4.

Also you repeated a few times that your daughter was 'having a bad day'. She sounds like an only child that is used to getting her way,  esp when you had her removed to the car so you could yell at your nephew. I think he is a teenage hungry kid, that didnt think it through maybe? It looked good and he was hungry? and he was your scapegoat. you should apologize", "YTA. \n  \nIt\u2019s understandable you were upset and frustrated. Yes your nephew should have known better. I\u2019m so sorry your daughter had such a bad day.

Compared to you, he is a child (you are his parent\u2019s generation) so you should have better self control. Instead you used your words intentionally to hurt him AND shame his parents. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not perfect, I do the same sometimes. But when I do, I try to recognise that behaviour and apologise. \n  \nI hope you\u2019re getting some professional help for your daughter. I\u2019m sure her special food will be put away somewhere safer next time.", "Soft ESH. \n\nI understand it\u2019s incredibly difficult to look after a special needs child. But it seems that you did not stop to check if it was a genuine mistake, or what was going through his head. Did he think that you weren\u2019t coming, since you were late? Did somebody tell him that you weren\u2019t coming, so that food would be free for grabs? \n\nAlso, it\u2019s OK to be hard on somebody for depriving your daughter of food. But you can be hard on somebody without resorting to being mean and almost name calling. You can say that you\u2019re pissed off, and that this is not OK, without saying \u201cyour parents never taught you to shut your mouth.\u201d  What he did was bad enough. You can say, \u201cThat\u2019s was her food. Now she has nothing to eat, and is having a meltdown, and we have to leave.\u201d Anybody with a reasonable amount of empathy would feel terrible at that. You don\u2019t have to insult him on top of it to try to make him feel worse. That probably had the opposite effect. By adding insult on top of it, you probably made him feel more defensive and less empathetic towards your situation.\n\nThe whole family is also partly to blame for referring to your daughters situation as \u201cpicky eating\u201d rather than a medical situation. Your nephew was still in the wrong, though. At 15, you should have enough self control not to eat a child\u2019s food.

A normal thing to say here would have been \"Are you kidding me?\" Or \"Why would you do that?\"  You clearly have other problems with your nephew.

It probably wouldn't have taken that long to make a new plate if you hadn't gone nuclear, and you could have even asked nephew to help make it so it'd be done faster.

Put her medical needs first.", "YTA.\n\nHe was wrong, but then you insulted him AND his mother... weirdly too, I might add. \n\nA better response would've been \"Why, Josh? Why did you eat the one meal Grandma made especially for Sara when you know damn well there's nothing else for her to eat?\" Then wait for his lame response. \n\nThen \"Thanks for ruining our evening, Josh. Sara had a really bad day and was looking forward to Grandma's cooking. I hope next time you won't be so selfish.\" \n\nBut what you did was just nasty. I know you were upset, but damn.", "Soft YTA.  It's totally understandable that you'd be upset, but the \"hard look\" and saying his parents never taught him, etc. wasn't about him, was it?

NTA for being mad, but YTA for how you handled it.", "You sound like a GREAT parent. YTA", "OP, you didn't even bother to see if there was more of the food! Which there almost certainly was, as it's near-impossible to make a single serving of most dishes, and surely grandma makes more than one serving, in case your daughter wants seconds? \n\nYou had a bad day, so you left zero room for the possibility of a  mistake being made. Is your nephew suddenly deciding that he absolutely can't resist the meal made with no spices for a picky 5-yr-old really the most likely scenario? If it somehow looks wildly appealing, which is hard to believe, he wouldn't ask grandma if there was a bit more? \n\nYour nephew may owe your daughter an apology, but you owe him and you s-i-l and really everyone an apology.", "YTA for sure. I understand concern about your daughter not being able to eat, but you just snapped at him without giving him a chance to apologize. Moreover, instead of asking him to apologize, ask for a reasoning, or telling him to do better you attacked his character. Pretty shitty of an adult to attack a 15 year old this way. Do better", "YTA. Yeah he shouldn\u2019t have eaten the food, it was a shitty thing he did. But he was already being reprimanded and there was absolutely 0 need for you to insult him or give dirty looks.  Maybe he thought you guys weren\u2019t coming cause you\u2019re late or something like that, not ok but understandable. Also would you ever allow someone to talk to your daughter like that? Especially if you already talked to her? Or she made a mistake? No you wouldn\u2019t, so don\u2019t talk to other peoples kids like that.", "Yeah your kinda TA. You had no right talking to your nephew like that, or talking down about her parenting. Have you ever raised a teenager? Or do you just have the one picky daughter?

Accidentally eating someone else\u2019s dinner does not warrant having everyone rush into the kitchen to scold that person for a genuine mistake that can be very easily corrected even if it\u2019s a tad inconvenient to do so. It also does not warrant having a grown adult scream profanities or insults at a child who was just doing what all kids do when hungry even if they should know better than to take stuff without checking first.", "Yes. You were an A to a kid. Your sister was guilty of indulging him. He definitely needed to be told that he was wrong but you needed to do it with calm maturity and self control. Now they can complain about your tone instead of looking at their behavior.", "jfc you\u2019re so rude stop trying to parent other people\u2019s kids what did you want him to do throw up the already eaten food and serve it to your daughter yta you had a bad day and you took it out on him apologize for speaking to him that way", "YTA, and if I were in this situation you would be uninvited to family events until I got a heartfelt apology from you. Come at my kid like that and you will find yourself being physically removed from the situation. That is not your child. Hell, you sound more childish than anything. You're going to verbally attack a CHILD over some food?! You're lucky SIL don't have a spine because you need put in your place.", "YTA! Maybe your nephew made an honest mistake and ate is without knowing who it was for. Why should everyone else cater to your child\u2019s tantrums at all times? You were rude to your SIL as well. Maybe next time make something yourself for your child to eat or ask MIL to make more of that particular dish.", "In my culture, YTA.  We don't yell at people, especially kids (no matter how old), for eating food at a dinner.  As with all families, we have people with special needs (whether it's a nut allergy, a toddler with sensory issues, kids and adults with GERD, diabetes, a special diet for people with organ transplants, dental issues, or religious restrictions) and if we make special food, we make more than one plate's worth so that others may join the person in eating in case the food looks appetizing or to help normalize the alternate food.  Sometimes the alternate food is a hit and then we make sure that everyone knows that it was made with a specific person in mind so that they can make sure to leave some for that person.  In the rare event that the food runs out, the whole family would jump up and try to pull together an alternative meal for the person affected.  But we would never berate someone for eating food.\n\nNothing in the original post suggests that the teenager knew that the food was solely for his cousin or that there wasn't more.  Perhaps he should have known based on past practice, but that isn't the same thing as purposefully harming her.  It sounds like the food situation is very stressful for OP, but that doesn't give her license to yell at or make rude comments to her nephew.\n\nEdit:  I just saw OP's comment that the nephew has never done this before, but sometimes makes himself a plate before everyone else eats.  This just cements my opinion more.\n\nP.S. I was a picky eater when I was young and could gag/throw up from eating food I hate.  I do not and did not have autism/ADHD/ARFID and now I eat most of what made me ill.  Of course, we should all support OP getting all of the help she needs for her child, whatever the issues may be.  Just wanted to chime in as someone who has always thrown up easily without another diagnosis.", "Don't parent other people's kids. Telling him you're so disappointed that he would do something so selfish and then taking your kid home is one thing. Yelling and insulting someone's kid is another. The parent was there and it was up to them to tell their kids not to be such a greedy pig. But maybe you should take a pass on dinners some times. People may be getting tired of accommodating your daughter's needs and your lateness every week. Nephew apparently doesn't care at all about you being there and he was a huge AH.", "YTA.

I know it feels like the end of the world to you but crap happens. He should have been told in private what he did wrong.. maybe even apologize but I doubt he was doing it malisciously. He's a boy..

You just needed the slightest justification to launch it in his direction after you used up your spoons keeping everything together for your own kid. It's not your job to parent your nephew and regardless of whether you felt her reaction was enough, your SIL had already stepped in and I can pretty well guarantee it would have continued to be talked about after you stormed out with your family. You're acting like a 15 year old isn't also a child with impulse issues and ego-centric ways of thinking/behaving. You are the adult, and you acted childishly. There are calm and appropriate ways to address the issue without insulting he and his parents about him not being \"taught to keep his mouth shut\". You are 100% the asshole and you are even more of one for continuing to try to justify taking the culmination of a shitty day (that sounds to be far more attributed to your dysregulated daughter) on a different child for being the cause of the cherry in the sundae.

My kids are also in the spectrum and it was hard in the beginning but they eat everything now. Did you as a parent placed her in a path of being a picky eater?

I\u2019m not a doctor, so I will not diagnose your daughter. I am, however, married to a pediatric occupational therapist, and one of the many things they work with children on is eating new foods and expanding what they will eat. They call it food school, and licensed, trained professionals will help your daughter work her way through trying new foods and understanding that it\u2019s ok to not eat the exact same thing or the same rotation of 3-4 foods while she is still young and moldable rather than allowing her to become incredibly set in ways that can be detrimental to her long term health.

Or of course you can supplement.\n\nI'm glad  peanut butter works for you!", "Peanut butter is a safe food for me, but it has to be crunchy. Creamy is too gross to me because I don\u2019t tolerate smooth foods or foods with soft texture", "I had such a light bulb moment when I finally worked out how to explain to people why I can't eat rice:\n\n\"You know when you're washing up and a little bit of food touches your hand in the water and it's temporarily the worst thing in the world? Well it's that. In my mouth. Repeatedly\"\n\nAnd people totally get it too! It's so much nicer than people just going \"you don't like /rice/?!\", they actually understand why it's a Problem.", "\u2026this just explained so much about me & my childhood", "Because these meals at MILs are a weekly event he has been attending regularly. He would've seen his cousin's meal be prepared multiple times and know for a fact that the one meal that is different from the others is hers. He definitely knows about her \"fussiness\" / ARFID. And knew that if he ate her food she wouldn't eat the food that's been prepared. He's 15, not 5. With these things taken into account, he certainly didn't eat it by accident.", ">Edit; I see it coming up a lot, by my SIL scolding my nephew I meant that she pointed at my daughter\u2019s food, told him not to that next time since it\u2019s his cousin food and lightly slapped his wrist like he\u2019s a five years old. Also my daughter\u2019s food was on the other end of the counter so no one will get confused \n\nSIL isn't helping family relations either. Her little 'don't do that again' and a literal tap on the wrist is not even remotely sufficient.\n\nAnd the food was one serving of one entirely separate dish that no one else was eating, and it was *also* placed some distance away from all the other dishes (which were all of a size to serve multiple people). And the kid knew his cousin was coming and hadn't eaten. The kid, *at the absolute best,* is incredibly thoughtless and self-centered, which also deserves a good deal more than 'hey, don't intentionally starve a little kid again [but doing it this time is no big deal; she won't die, so it's fine to let her go hungry]'.", "15 is plenty old enough to be reprimanded by people who aren\u2019t your parents. He\u2019s old enough to have a job in some states, he\u2019s old enough to be told \u2018no\u2019 by someone who isn\u2019t mommy.", "Nope, SIL blatantly rug swept. She mocked OP with a little fake slap that you do to children when they're learning to share. The fact is that this is a weekly event so the nephew has no excuse. He has witnessed this for years and knows exactly why that meal was made. He should've been made to cook her food himself.", "Sure, you\u2019re right. I wrongly included ARFID and sensory issues as under the autism umbrella instead of acknowledging they don\u2019t always go together. \n\nWhat I mean to say is that I don\u2019t think a diagnosed condition is the only reason somebody should not get social backlash for not eating foods they don\u2019t like.", "I agree with this. I always make sure my grandchildren have what they like. It's my house and if I choose the extra work, it's my business. It's just another small way of spoiling the grandbabies which is what the grandparents are known to do. Anything that gets you a sweet smile.", "I don't think u/Sufficient-Spring437 is familiar with the concept of familial love or has anyone who even liked them enough to have introduced them to notions of hospitality.\n\nIt's the only explanation I can think of for why someone would say that a child's grandmother shouldn't cook for them while making allowances for their food intolerances.", "Yeah, when I was a little kid, my mom realized I was going to be an extremely picky eater like my dad, even though he wasn't around for me to mimic his eating, so she really focused on me being able to eat peanut butter.", "I have it with the overly soft feeling of animal fat (inside meat) or aspic. It makes me gag. I\u2019ve taught myself to deal with it through foods I love (red braised pork belly) but I avoid it for everything else.", "Holy fuck that literally made me gag. I absolutely do not blame you I could absolutely never with that description \ud83e\udd2e for me it's beets, they have a very specific metallic and musty/mildew-y after taste to them that I cannot handle whatsoever. people always give me a hard time over beets bc I usually love really earthy tasting foods (i.e., foods most people find to taste like dirt etc)  and I always get 'but why don't you like beets? they taste sweet and like dirt and you LOVE stuff that tastes like dirt' except I would literally eat handfuls of dirt over having to taste the metallic mildew experience that is beets.", "Also OP does not give any indication of pattern.  No telling us that he's done this before, so we sorta have to assume this was a one off.\n\nTho OP's comment does seem to indicate a boy of large appetite-- surprising in a growing teen?", "From the sound of it, SIL handled the discipline sarcastically. She knew what he was doing. Hell, it's likely they mock the child behind her back be abuse of these issues (I have a family full of AHs; this is totally happening). I would have said something to all of them and would have been shitty about it. It's a 6 year old with food issues. They're grown ass people! They don't get the respect of me not parenting their child because they are raising a monster! Thank God I have cut contact with most of my family. My introverted, ASD/ADHD ass is too old to deal with nonsense like this.", "I\u2019m sorry you had you deal with it too", "I wouldn\u2019t go to that extreme. Some people just believe certain \u201cnorms\u201d are be all or end all. Like when parents pay their older child/ren to babysit, it\u2019s parentification instead of seeing it as the child being offered the choice to earn some extra money. Or if a woman chooses to make her husband lunch for work everyday, the husband is misogynistic. There\u2019s no room for nuances.", "also, i dont usually look at plates if its with the other food. if there was only enough for daughter, it should have been put away until she got there.", "Or he's overweight and OP was taking a shot at him.", "As a mother to a teen, can confirm. \n\nAnd at that age teens will eat an absolutely astonishing amount of food if they're going through their last but growth spurt.", "Wow, you\u2019re making a whole hell of a lot of assumptions there! \u201cIt\u2019s likely they mock the child behind her back\u201d WHAT?! What makes you think that?! \u201cShe knew what he was doing\u201d Again, what?! There is nothing in this post to indicate that she knew. If you think it was likely she knew, then it would be just as likely grandma knew & it sound as if grandma goes the extra mile for her grandkids so I doubt she knew either. He\u2019s a monster?? For eating the child\u2019s food?? You don\u2019t even have enough info to know he did it on purpose! For all we know, he\u2019s neurodivergent, didn\u2019t like the main meal & put no thought into why there would be a single serving of other food. From the info we have about this situation 1/2 of your response makes no sense!", "I generally assume that to be the product of a deeply toxic upbringing in which they weren't exposed to the idea that sometimes people genuinely like each other and do things not because they have to but because they want to.\n\nHence: not familiar with familial love or concepts of hospitality. It's a vicious cycle, because it's hard to form a healthy relationship with someone who thinks everything is transactional and there's something wrong with love and kindness.", "This absolutely reads like a personal shot against him intended to hurt him, not just change behavior for further gatherings.", "Did you read her post? The SIL and Nephew's behavior allows one to infer the assertions I made. The way SIL spoke to him and the little toddler hand slap said so much. I grew up with family like this. I have seen this before. It's a game to people who don't get neurodivergence (thinks it's made up and fake, kids spoiled, etc) to do this stuff and then mock. Everyone knew it was her food. Grandma sent PICTURES. Either Nephew was jealous or SIL decided that her kid wasn't getting enough attention. \n\nYou are forgetting the first rule of Reddit. Always think the worst of everyone in the situation and ask questions later.", "I assume it\u2019s social media influences. People are able to share extremely bad situations with everyone. As a consequence, others begin to think that it should never happen regardless of nuance. Although I can understand your point of view. \n\nHowever, they have revealed their thought process to stem from familial influences. So I\u2019ll concede there.", "No, it sounded like frustration because the gluttonous teenager had probably eaten things before that they shouldn't have."]}
