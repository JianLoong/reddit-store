We got engaged a year ago in 2021 and have been planning our wedding since. It's going to be a small wedding with our dearest friends and family.\n\nThe problem right now is that my fiance's brother got a new gf 5 months ago. So far we have met her three times and she has never talked to us directly and even if she talks she doesn't look at us but behaves totally normal around his other siblings and his parents. We didn't know her before so we were taken aback by her behavior. We tried having a conversation with her but she would only say like two-word sentences and then would stop talking to us and would turn to MIL again. On christmas she even ignored me and she doesn't even know my full name or what we both are working as because she never tried to strike a conversation with us. We are all adults so we don't understand what we did wrong. Our wedding was never a topic of interest in his family but recently we got to know that the gf thinks she's invited although we never said so. We only know about it because my MIL told us that the gf was looking for some kind of hotel close to our wedding destination.\nAfter all we both don't want to invite her to our wedding because we don't even know her but we are not sure if we are the assholes because we know it'll leave a sour aftertaste in my MIL's mouth if we don't invite gf.\n\nJust to clarify this: she talks and looks at other people from my fiance's family. We are the only ones she avoids and doesn't talk to although we tried to talk to her multiple times.\n\nSorry, thought the term \"SIL\" was easier to understand the story but it was only confusing so i deleted that. She is \"only\" the gf of my fiance's brother.", "created_utc": 1672945041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1046w7t/aita_for_not_inviting_my_sil_to_my_wedding/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It could be completely innocent or if she doesn't like you it being out in the open would allow both parties not to have to deal with each other on the big day.

Trust me, stay out of it.", "NTA\n\nShe's not your SIL because neither of you are married in law to the 2 brothers at this point.\n\nEven when you get married, she's not your SIL. \n\nI think disinviting the \"plus one\" of your fiance's brother might feel justified in the circumstances but it's likely to cause you problems meshing with the new family.\n\nYou have the wedding you want, but know that if you create rifts between yourself and the new family, they may take years to unrift.", "NAH. Yet. I\u2019d give her more time. You have the opportunity to get to know her better. It\u2019s only January.

Family is defined as your blood/legal relatives, plus anyone who is married or cohabits with those people.\n\nUnder this ruleset, the gf you refer to as SIL doesn't qualify, because she doesn't live with your future brother-in-law. (If they've only known each other 5 months but she's already moved in, then she counts as family, and should get an invitation even under these rules).\n\nThe next set of rules says that all your friends and family get to invite a \"plus one\" - a partner of their choice to accompany them. In this set of rules, you get a whole bunch of random bfs and gfs that you've never met coming to your wedding. In this ruleset, new brother could clearly bring his gf as a \"plus one\".\n\nAnd then there's the practical rule, which says that from your post, this girl clearly has quite a close relationship with your future in-laws, and is well loved by them, and so you'll cause unnecessary bad feeling if you exclude her.\n\nIt's your wedding, so you can do what you want, but you should be prepared for the likely consequences.\n\nNAH", "NAH, So she's your future BIL's gf?  I think he'd be allowed a plus 1, so ... I think based on that, not having him bring her might be problematic. I understand what you are feeling here. Can you talk to  fianc\u00e9's brother.   She's TAH, but you weren't asking that. So that's why I said NAH", "technically NTA, its your wedding. But diplomatically is it really worth it to exclude her?\n\nShe may be more comfortable around other people there because she's met them more, or she may think you dislike her for some reason, or who knows. You've failed to strike up a relationship with her and thats not the end of the world, but making a point of excluding her when you mention in comments that everyone else with a partner gets to bring them will ensure you never have one.", "Everyone here will probably tell you \"not the ahole\" because \"your wedding, your rules\" and I'll get downvoted because I'm going to point out how dumb an idea this is.  \n\nThis is a stupid decision which will create ***more*** problems in your life later.  And all for what?  To exclude a woman who isn't comfortable talking to you now and you know will not interact with you anyways on your wedding day (of that you can be sure).  You will be swarmed by friends and family and her presence in the background won't be noticed and will be utterly forgettable.  Years from now she might be in a few pictures and that's all.\n\nExcluding her will put your fiance's brother into a terrible position.  You will have insulted his relationship by diminishing it and put him into the position of creating a strain on the gf relationship by going to something she's excluded from or creating a strain on the family relationship by not going to the wedding.  Either way, its going to spread to the rest of the family and make people take sides and not everyone is going to take your side.\n\nSend the fiance's brother and his gf an invitation.  Consider tolerating the gf to be the price of a good relationship with the brother and the rest of the family.\n\nYTA or more precisely, YWBTDA (you would be the dumb ass) who creates more problems for yourself and your future in laws with by not inviting this person.", "NTA.

(I know that Q is redundant). \n\nQuestion 2:  if your BiL was single and had a +1 and brought a complete stranger you\u2019d never met because he wanted someone to be connected with and dance and all that to enjoy the wedding, would you feel the same way as him bringing this relative stranger who you have met and had awkward experiences with?", "I go by the rule that it's your event; you're paying for it; so it's your guest list. NTA \n\nHowever,  I also caution people to think about the consequences of their actions. \n\nAre you inviting plus ones?  If so, it's pretty much out of your control unless you single her out for exclusion.  In that case, prepare for a s**tstorm and the real possibility that your fiance's brother (as well as other family members) won't go. I assume that he's in the wedding party, so he'll probably withdraw from that, as a minimum. \n\nIf you plan to limit your invites to people who you name, only, then you're on more solid ground. Even then, there's likely to be blowback. \n\nYour wedding.  Your guest list.", "It\u2019s your wedding so NTA, buuuuttt I think you could be more diplomatic here.\n\nAlso is she your SIL or your BIL\u2019s girlfriend.\n\nYou need to have a couple conversations. The main one here is that your BIL (assuming it\u2019s his girlfriend you\u2019re talking about here) needs to keep her in check. Your fiancee needs to talk to his brother about her, and what she means to him, if it\u2019s worth it, and if that\u2019s the case how they plan to handle the situation as to not invade upon your special day.", "INFO: You mention you've met her three times in 5 months. Do you live far away where seeing family is infrequent? Is it a possibility she has honed relationships  with other members  because they visit one another more frequently  having more time to get to know each other where she's feels more familiar/comfortable with them?", "INFO: are you not allowing your guests to have +1s? If you\u2019re inviting the brother (sounds obvious), and you\u2019re letting other guests bring a date, but specifically wouldn\u2019t bring her then YTA.\nIf that\u2019s the case I\u2019d suggest just letting her be there. You won\u2019t have time to engage with her anyway, and it doesn\u2019t seem like she would cause a scene or any distress. \n\nIf no one gets a +1 because it\u2019s a very very small wedding, NTA. She\u2019s still a new gf, you don\u2019t have much connection, okay to just be close family and friends.", "So here's the thing. Yes that's weird behaviour from her, and I'm not surprised it's left a bad taste in your mouth. You could not invite her, return her perceived bad manners with a slight of your own, let it fester and strain family relationships for possibly ever, if she ends up being in the family permanently. \n\nOR. You could invite her, because she's BIL's partner. You could make an effort to get to know her individually, you and her could go out for coffee just the two of you. You could give her the benefit of the doubt, there might be lots of reasons she's not been warm with you so far, maybe she's intimidated, maybe she's shy. You could make an effort, because life is short and family is important, and in a few years you and her might be laughing about that time she was weirdly shy around you in the beginning.\n\nShe's being distant, not hateful, so I think YTA if you write off the relationship at this point. Which you will be doing if you actively exclude her from your wedding.", "YTA.  First off, why don't you just maturely confront her and ask if there is an issue.  But as for the invite, you already know that it's going to cause a shitstorm on your future hubby's side of the family and you want to cause all this drama out of what, spite? Spite for which you don't even know why she dislikes you or if she even dislikes you at all?  Maybe she's intimidated somehow.  \n\nAnyway, and I'm saying this ONLY for YOUR own sake.  It would be much smarter to invite her.  It's not like you have spend much or even any time with her if you don't want.", "Wouldn't she just be your BIL's +1?", "INFO: Is she your fiance's brother's GF or your SIL? Are they married? This is confusing.\n\nRegardless, I think YTA. A plus one is the norm for wedding invites. Your fiance's brother should be able to bring whomever he wants. You don't have to hang out with her at the wedding, though,", "NTA.  It's your wedding, invite who you want.", "INFO: Are you a different race than your bf and his family?\n\nEither way, NTA. I have no clue why she would assume she was invited! Tell your bf to talk to his brother and let him know the people who are attending your wedding are those you have already invited and that's it!", "If I\u2019m reading this correctly, the wedding isn\u2019t until September of this year. Why draw a line about this now? Can\u2019t you wait and see if they even stay together? Won\u2019t the invitations go out closer to the date?\n\nYou can invite whoever you want.

She's not family and would be at the wedding only because your BIL brought her.\n\nIf you were to either deny your FIL a +1 or were you to specify who can be that +1, then YWBTA.", "YTA\n\nUsually people at weddings are invited with their significant other. So even if you didn't know his gf, your BIL still would come accompanied if he was in a stable relationship. Not inviting her on purpose is really AH move, excluding her although she didn't harm you in any way, didn't bad mouth you, etc. You're not compatible or she is shy around you, maybe it has nothing to do with you, that's fine, you won't even get the chance to talk to her that day.
