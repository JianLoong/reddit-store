He loved the puppy and they immediately became best friends. He has asked me for a puppy for years. I also have a daughter (4) who also loved the puppy, but struggled to feel empathy for the dog or understand when it was hurt.   \nwe\u2019ll call my son Jason and my Daughter Emily.  \nIn the first week Emily had already picked it up by the leash twice, tangled it the curtains and just generally made it feel unsafe. She is not currently in daycare or kindergarten and I work from home so I\u2019m with them both most of the time, but she would lock herself and the puppy in my son\u2019s room to do these behaviours. I would punish her every time but she just didn\u2019t understand when the dog was uncomfortable.   \nThe second week, they were all in the backyard when my daughter scared the puppy, causing it to run up the steps of our house (one story up). These steps have gaps big enough for a puppy to fall through. Jason tried to call for it to stop, causing it to try to come back down and fall down A WHOLE LEVEL. Thankfully it landed on some paper and bubble wrap we had stored under the steps, but it was still limping. The bone was not broken though.   \nAfter that my Husband and I had a talk with both of the kids about the responsibility of owning a pet. I tried to emphasise how hurt the puppy could have been to my daughter, telling her that her job is to make the dog feel safe. I told my son that it\u2019s his responsibility to make sure that he isn\u2019t distracted by his phone or something to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.   \nTwo weeks later, only minor incidents from Emily. Everything seems to be going fine. Dog spends most of the day hiding from her, but at least the puppy is safe.   \nMy kids both get sick with the flu, and have to stay home. I have errands to run, but Jason is there to take care of Puppy and Emily. Few hours later I receive a text from Jason saying the dog has been hurt again. Emily threw something at the dog. It screamed, but was still able to walk and seemed okay.   \nI come back another few hours later with some groceries and ask Jason and Husband to help bring them upstairs. This leaves the puppy and Emily alone together.  \nI hear the dog screaming like I have never heard before. Everyone runs in to the room. Emily is standing next to the dog, which is absolutely screaming in pain. My son runs to check the dog while my Husband and I try to find out what happened. All I get from Emily is \u201cI did nothing! Nothing happened! I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s screaming!\u201d.  \nAt this point I realised that this was not the best life for the puppy, and was worried my children may give the poor thing a lifelong injury.  \nI gave the dog to my parents, who have a large backyard and a safer house for the puppy. This absolutely devastated my kids, especially my son. He is barely speaking to me now and even less to his sister \u2013 which I don\u2019t think is fair because it\u2019s not really her fault. My son knew he had to be more careful minding them.  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693475263, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1666m8e/aita_for_rehoming_my_kids_puppy/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Showing behavior like this at such a young age is alarming. The puppy was your responsibility to watch though, because the pup got hurt when you should have been supervising your daughter, that's not on your son. I know sometimes it's ok for an older teenager to watch a sibling, but your daughter had already shown this behaviour before it got hurt so Ill say gently you shouldn't have lectured him about how it was his responsibility to keep the puppy safe. The attention should have been on managing your daughters behaviour yourself. I'm sorry if that sounds harsh.\n\nThis really sucks for your son and I feel for him.

You and your husband are the parents; you both should have stepped up long ago and put safeguards in place so that your daughter was properly supervised and that puppy was safe. The fact you failed to adequately do that isn't his fault.\n\nAlso, you expected your son to keep a close watch on his sister at all times around the puppy, yet you knowingly left her alone with it when you asked for help with the groceries, which resulted in her hurting the poor thing so badly it screamed.

Not sure why you\u2019re worried your *children* will give it a lifelong injury when your son hasn\u2019t hurt the dog. Being worried Emily will give the dog a lifelong injury also doesn\u2019t support your claim that she isn\u2019t a danger to pets.\n\n>He is barely speaking to me now and even less to his sister \u2013 which I don\u2019t think is fair because it\u2019s not really her fault.
