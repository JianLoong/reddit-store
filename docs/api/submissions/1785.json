I'm sure he would have understood considering how debilitating it seems to be for you.\n\nCould the best man speech not have been handed over to another close friend of the groom? I've seen many weddings where the bride and groom have more than one best man or maid of honor, so I'm sure you could have arranged something.\n\nSkipping out on the ceremony entirely, though, OP? That's pretty cold. You really should have gone, even if just as a normal attendee. Why didn't you? \n\nIt's a shame to see what looks on the outside to be a pretty simple lack of communication lead to a complete breakdown of your relationship with your friend.\n\nIncredibly soft YTA. You should have worked harder to explain your situation, and to show up for your friend even if you couldn't be best man. Try and see if it's not too late to repair things with your friend. It would be a shame to lose someone who obviously held you very close.", "YTA\n\nI understand not wanting to be the best man due to your phobia of public speaking, you could have said \u201cmate, I\u2019m honoured you want me for a best man, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right person for role. I have a phobia of public speaking and I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll work.  It I think I could handle being a groomsman if you\u2019ll have me\u201d?\n\n\nInstead you just wussed out and didn\u2019t even attend your own best friends wedding just to avoid confrontation, anyone would be rightfully pissed if their best friend did that to them", "Dude what??

You should have come here before the wedding. I'm sorry, but yes, YTA. You don't *have* to do a speech as the best man.

Its within your right to say no,  I get not wanting to do any of this cause im the same way. But we have to make sacrifices and be uncomfortable sometimes for those we love.

That was a situation in which you could have supported them and not been forced to speak. I don't actually think that you're a shitty person because it seems pretty clearly like you have the kind of anxiety that qualifies as a real mental illness. But that said, you should have just popped a Xanax or whatever works for you and gone to the ceremony and cheered them on. You might want to write them a long letter of love and apology and send them a really good wedding gift.

He loved you enough to ask you to be best man, but you weren't present for the actual wedding ceremony. That's a big deal. That's the moment they got married.\n\nI also understand why you lied, but I hope you understand why that made the situation worse. Saying that you couldn't afford it just made it a lot more confusing for them. I get why you did it, it was anxiety and probably a little bit of ego, but don't do that again.

I explained everything to her and the reason why. I told her that I had thought about nothing else since he asked me and that the worry was making me physically ill. I've no idea how much she told him. But, it seems like they still weren't very happy about it, considering what his mother said to me at the reception. Which made me not want to be there longer than I had to be.", "yeah, but he said even after declining best man he was invited and didnt go", "I see that.. He obviously felt uncomfortable with the to and fro prior to the wedding.

Hopefully they'll be able to repair the friendship. I'm sure both are equally hurt for not being able to understand or communicate with each other. It feels like they were \"talking past each other\" which is a direct translation of a Danish phrase.\n(Not sure how to say it in English any longer.)", "I dunno it sounds like a classic anxiety response to a stressful situation.  Catastrophize until you convince yourself it would be better if you just didn't try at all.", "strong agree. could have been avoided with good communication", "That's exactly what it was. By this point, I had convinced myself that my presence there would either result in one of two things happening:\n\n1. I'd be \"forced\" to be the best man. I know this is absurd, but my mind had convinced me that this could happen and i would be coerced into being the best man and I'd make such a mess of it that I would humiliate myself and ruin their wedding.\n\n2. Everyone would know that I said no to being the best man and I'd be humiliated in front of an entire wedding procession when I got called out for it and ruin the entire day for them.\n\nSo, to me, quietly slipping in and out was the only option I could see. Trust me, I didn't even want to go that far. All day I was arguing with myself if I should even go to the reception at all and when I eventually did, I sat at the bar the whole time by myself, interacted with only a couple of people and hoped to god no-one would talk to me. So when i got dressed down by my friends mother during the reception, it confirmed everything I had been feeling. How do I explain to a Bride and Groom that, in the run up to their wedding, I had been physically sick more than once thinking about going to their big day?", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry, but you are. I feel for you having such severe issues on speaking publicly but this is something you should\u2019ve managed beforehand to be there for who you call your best friend. Maybe, in time, he will be open to speaking to you again. But for now I believe this friendship is over. At the very least, it\u2019ll never be like it was before. You may have to just accept being acquaintances and move on.", "These are all the consequences of your actions. \n\nYTA\n\nYou went about it terribly.", "I\u2019m going with a gentle YTA. This is your best friend and you have a pretty crippling phobia. Had you never talked to him about it? As your best friend I would hope he would have been understanding. Lying about the reason unfortunately set up a domino effect. If you want to try to salvage this friendship I\u2019d recommend a very expensive wedding gift (partially joking partially not) and a letter profusely apologizing and explaining in detail your phobia and how you panicked and lied when the fianc\u00e9 called you. Honesty is the only hope you have of getting your friendship back.", "I don\u2019t understand. Does your best mate not know you have social anxiety? Did you tell him how hard it was when you were both groomsmen last time? I agree with other people that it seems to be an issue with communication. I say this as someone who has turned down invites due to anxiety as well as a future bride who\u2019s MOH has social anxiety- we haven\u2019t even set the date and I\u2019ve asked her how much she can do comfortably because her being there is the most important . Talk to your friend, not his wife, and see if you can salvage this", "YTA for not even going to the damn wedding! \nIt's one thing to decline the roll of best man, but why on earth not just attend as a regular guest?", "I feel like this got way more out of control than it needed to. Shouldn\u2019t he have already known about your anxieties before he asked you? Couldn\u2019t you have accepted the role and let another groomsman give the speech?  Were you invited to the bachelor party? How did you and your friend never go out for a coffee alone and talk about this before it got to the point of you not attending the wedding?", "YTA. Why did you not voice all of this with your friend? There could of been a compromise on the best man speech I believe. You let her phobia get in the way of a friendship without even discussing it with him. Then you didn\u2019t even attend the ceremony and barely the reception. You showed you friend that you don\u2019t really seem to care about him or this event in his life over something that could of been worked out. Put yourself in his shoes!", "If your worst nightmare is standing in front of a crowd, all eyes on you & making a speech you will never get married!", "YTA You didn't even go to the wedding? Did you at least tell him you weren't going?", "YTA but I do have a lot of sympathy for your anxiety. So while I don\u2019t think you were necessarily wrong for your reaction, your friend very clearly told you he valued your friendship, he wanted you in his life, and every opportunity you had to do so, you ran from, it\u2019s hard to see a path forward for a friendship now.", "At the previous wedding I was a bag of nerves, close to having a full-on breakdown at points. I skipped the wedding breakfast because I was having a panic attack. I couldn't eat any of the dinner, because I was worried that someone was going to hand me a microphone and ask me to say a few words all the way through it. I stayed away from all the other guests, unless they were part of my friend group. It was just me and my girlfriend at the previous wedding sitting alone. We found somewhere quiet away from everyone else and just talked to each other. I've never done anything like that before and I hated ever minute of it. Then all I could see this time is how so much worse it was going to be as the Best Man and I panicked.\nL", "I doubt he knew how badly I was affected by anxiety. We didn't talk about stuff like that. I also kept it well hidden. He knew I was socially introverted. But other than that, I doubt it. To be honest, I thought he'd ask his brother to be his best man, so I didn't really think about until the day he asked me. I went to his bachelor party, but I didn't organise it, as he hadn't asked me by that point. It was thrown together by his brother a couple of months beforehand.", "That is pretty obviously a typo...", "I get that! Honestly I do. But did you tell your friend that at any time between then and just not turning up to his wedding? People can\u2019t make things easier if they have no idea there\u2019s a problem. Now the lying isn\u2019t a good look and has blown what could have been a sensible grown up convo between two friends into an issue with his now wife and ugh I get it the problem now is so anxiety inducing the longer you leave it the worse it gets until it feels like there\u2019s no point even trying. But and I say this in the nicest way possible you messed up here not him so you need to reach out and apologise and ask if you can meet up and explain. Then talk to your friend. Sorry for the wall of text I just want this to be resolved for you and I truly think it can be.", "Right. So knowing this, from his perspective it looks like you rejected an offer that is usually meant to honor someone in your life you consider close to you, then made up some lies to avoid it, then you stepped out of his wedding celebration early, because\u2026you didn\u2019t wanna. You said you told the fianc\u00e9e but again you didn\u2019t even do this close friend the courtesy of telling him personally. In your brain you understand all of it and you feel immense guilt but he\u2019s not in your brain. You need to understand that from the outside extreme anxiety and avoidance just looks rude and cold, people can\u2019t read your mind. It\u2019s on you to communicate this and if you don\u2019t then the natural consequence is making people feel alienated and hurt. You can try to explain and make it up but you\u2019ve broken his trust and it would likely be a long road to earning it back. YTA.", "Makes sense. Especially when the anxiety \u201ctriggers\u201d don\u2019t come up in day to day living. I hope you can salvage the friendship. Maybe if you can express everything to him in writing ( if it\u2019s too hard to call), he will understand?", "This has to be an ESH at best. While it's unfortunate that his friend didn't understand anxiety, OP completely abandoned his friend by bailing on the wedding even as a guest. \n\nNot even attending as a guest was OP's big asshole move here, and it's probably what actually cost him this friendship. And that, sadly, is all OP's fault.", "Definitely YTA and a lot less soft than this original comment. You need to be an adult and not lie. You say you explained everything but it came after a lie. Why should they believe that is the truth? You come across as a pretty terrible friend in all this. He\u2019s better off without you if this is how you treat those closest to you", "You didn\u2019t tell him then unfortunately. He needed to hear it from you. Also, the fact that you and your best bud were groomsmen at another wedding, but you wouldn\u2019t even stand up with him at his own sent a pretty clear message to him. Social anxiety disorders are no laughing matter. Please seek therapy and learn some tools to both help deal with having the anxiety and to help communicate clearly and kindly. You\u2019ve hurt your friend deeply. From what I\u2019ve read he may very well feel like he was rejected and that you mean more to him than he means to you. Imagine being blindsided with this information - that your dearest friendship was a lie. He\u2019s probably reeling. You have a lot of work to do.\nEdit to say you are NTA for having anxiety, but you are definitely the AH for how you handled the situation and your friends emotions."]}
