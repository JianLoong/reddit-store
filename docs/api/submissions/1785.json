I'm sure he would have understood considering how debilitating it seems to be for you.\n\nCould the best man speech not have been handed over to another close friend of the groom? I've seen many weddings where the bride and groom have more than one best man or maid of honor, so I'm sure you could have arranged something.\n\nSkipping out on the ceremony entirely, though, OP? That's pretty cold. You really should have gone, even if just as a normal attendee. Why didn't you? \n\nIt's a shame to see what looks on the outside to be a pretty simple lack of communication lead to a complete breakdown of your relationship with your friend.\n\nIncredibly soft YTA. You should have worked harder to explain your situation, and to show up for your friend even if you couldn't be best man. Try and see if it's not too late to repair things with your friend. It would be a shame to lose someone who obviously held you very close.", "YTA\n\nI understand not wanting to be the best man due to your phobia of public speaking, you could have said \u201cmate, I\u2019m honoured you want me for a best man, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right person for role.

That was a situation in which you could have supported them and not been forced to speak. I don't actually think that you're a shitty person because it seems pretty clearly like you have the kind of anxiety that qualifies as a real mental illness. But that said, you should have just popped a Xanax or whatever works for you and gone to the ceremony and cheered them on.

That's the moment they got married.\n\nI also understand why you lied, but I hope you understand why that made the situation worse.

Hopefully they'll be able to repair the friendship. I'm sure both are equally hurt for not being able to understand or communicate with each other.

I know this is absurd, but my mind had convinced me that this could happen and i would be coerced into being the best man and I'd make such a mess of it that I would humiliate myself and ruin their wedding.\n\n2. Everyone would know that I said no to being the best man and I'd be humiliated in front of an entire wedding procession when I got called out for it and ruin the entire day for them.\n\nSo, to me, quietly slipping in and out was the only option I could see. Trust me, I didn't even want to go that far. All day I was arguing with myself if I should even go to the reception at all and when I eventually did, I sat at the bar the whole time by myself, interacted with only a couple of people and hoped to god no-one would talk to me.

Lying about the reason unfortunately set up a domino effect. If you want to try to salvage this friendship I\u2019d recommend a very expensive wedding gift (partially joking partially not) and a letter profusely apologizing and explaining in detail your phobia and how you panicked and lied when the fianc\u00e9 called you.

Talk to your friend, not his wife, and see if you can salvage this", "YTA for not even going to the damn wedding! \nIt's one thing to decline the roll of best man, but why on earth not just attend as a regular guest?", "I feel like this got way more out of control than it needed to. Shouldn\u2019t he have already known about your anxieties before he asked you? Couldn\u2019t you have accepted the role and let another groomsman give the speech?  Were you invited to the bachelor party? How did you and your friend never go out for a coffee alone and talk about this before it got to the point of you not attending the wedding?", "YTA. Why did you not voice all of this with your friend? There could of been a compromise on the best man speech I believe. You let her phobia get in the way of a friendship without even discussing it with him. Then you didn\u2019t even attend the ceremony and barely the reception. You showed you friend that you don\u2019t really seem to care about him or this event in his life over something that could of been worked out.

Did you at least tell him you weren't going?", "YTA but I do have a lot of sympathy for your anxiety. So while I don\u2019t think you were necessarily wrong for your reaction, your friend very clearly told you he valued your friendship, he wanted you in his life, and every opportunity you had to do so, you ran from, it\u2019s hard to see a path forward for a friendship now.", "At the previous wedding I was a bag of nerves, close to having a full-on breakdown at points. I skipped the wedding breakfast because I was having a panic attack. I couldn't eat any of the dinner, because I was worried that someone was going to hand me a microphone and ask me to say a few words all the way through it. I stayed away from all the other guests, unless they were part of my friend group. It was just me and my girlfriend at the previous wedding sitting alone. We found somewhere quiet away from everyone else and just talked to each other. I've never done anything like that before and I hated ever minute of it. Then all I could see this time is how so much worse it was going to be as the Best Man and I panicked.\nL", "I doubt he knew how badly I was affected by anxiety. We didn't talk about stuff like that. I also kept it well hidden. He knew I was socially introverted. But other than that, I doubt it. To be honest, I thought he'd ask his brother to be his best man, so I didn't really think about until the day he asked me. I went to his bachelor party, but I didn't organise it, as he hadn't asked me by that point. It was thrown together by his brother a couple of months beforehand.", "That is pretty obviously a typo...", "I get that! Honestly I do. But did you tell your friend that at any time between then and just not turning up to his wedding? People can\u2019t make things easier if they have no idea there\u2019s a problem. Now the lying isn\u2019t a good look and has blown what could have been a sensible grown up convo between two friends into an issue with his now wife and ugh I get it the problem now is so anxiety inducing the longer you leave it the worse it gets until it feels like there\u2019s no point even trying. But and I say this in the nicest way possible you messed up here not him so you need to reach out and apologise and ask if you can meet up and explain. Then talk to your friend. Sorry for the wall of text I just want this to be resolved for you and I truly think it can be.", "Right. So knowing this, from his perspective it looks like you rejected an offer that is usually meant to honor someone in your life you consider close to you, then made up some lies to avoid it, then you stepped out of his wedding celebration early, because\u2026you didn\u2019t wanna. You said you told the fianc\u00e9e but again you didn\u2019t even do this close friend the courtesy of telling him personally. In your brain you understand all of it and you feel immense guilt but he\u2019s not in your brain. You need to understand that from the outside extreme anxiety and avoidance just looks rude and cold, people can\u2019t read your mind. It\u2019s on you to communicate this and if you don\u2019t then the natural consequence is making people feel alienated and hurt. You can try to explain and make it up but you\u2019ve broken his trust and it would likely be a long road to earning it back. YTA.", "Makes sense.

Maybe if you can express everything to him in writing ( if it\u2019s too hard to call), he will understand?", "This has to be an ESH at best. While it's unfortunate that his friend didn't understand anxiety, OP completely abandoned his friend by bailing on the wedding even as a guest. \n\nNot even attending as a guest was OP's big asshole move here, and it's probably what actually cost him this friendship. And that, sadly, is all OP's fault.", "Definitely YTA and a lot less soft than this original comment. You need to be an adult and not lie. You say you explained everything but it came after a lie. Why should they believe that is the truth? You come across as a pretty terrible friend in all this. He\u2019s better off without you if this is how you treat those closest to you", "You didn\u2019t tell him then unfortunately. He needed to hear it from you. Also, the fact that you and your best bud were groomsmen at another wedding, but you wouldn\u2019t even stand up with him at his own sent a pretty clear message to him. Social anxiety disorders are no laughing matter. Please seek therapy and learn some tools to both help deal with having the anxiety and to help communicate clearly and kindly. You\u2019ve hurt your friend deeply. From what I\u2019ve read he may very well feel like he was rejected and that you mean more to him than he means to you. Imagine being blindsided with this information - that your dearest friendship was a lie. He\u2019s probably reeling. You have a lot of work to do.\nEdit to say you are NTA for having anxiety, but you are definitely the AH for how you handled the situation and your friends emotions.", "ESH for me anyway. You should have been honest from the start and said no and why. They should have accepted that no and not tried to force you to do it by guilting you.\n\nWe had exactly the same with my husband's best friend, he said exactly the same.

The biggest reason is you made ZERO effort to find a compromise with your supposed best friend. You just lied and then avoided. Your friendship is probably beyond repair, but if you care at all I\u2019d be making amends.", "YTA. You could have, at any point, spoke to your best friend about what was bothering you. But you elected not to. \n\nYou could have attended your friend's wedding, but you chose not to. Why would anyone still be friends with someone who won't even communicate with them? What kind of \"best friend\" won't go to his best friend's wedding? \n\nYour ex-best friend is honestly better off without if this is how passively you behave and communicate.", "YTA. Not wanting to be Best Man and avoid giving a speech because of your phobia is totally understandable. You screwed up however by not even going to the ceremony. That's what hurt your friend the most. He and his fiancee/wife could have dealt with finding another person as best man but for his best friend to skip the wedding comes across as you not supporting their marriage. That's why they ghosted you.", "YTA \n\nI totally understand not wanting to stand in front of a crowd and give a speech. The #1 fear of Americans is public speaking, so I get why you might be anxious about that. \n\nHowever, being a best man is an honor, and I'm sure the fact that you were being so dodgy about doing it was hurtful. On top of that, you don't even show up for the ceremony, and are barely there for the reception. Do you even like your friend? This is the biggest moment of his life so far, and you don't even show up? \n\nI think if you were upfront about your anxiety you could have worked this out. If you told him you really wanted to do this for him, but you can't do the speech part. You guys could have figured something out. Like maybe you write the speech but another groomsman reads it. Something. But completely avoiding the situation is now how you treat your friends.", "YTA. \n\nYou absolutely messed this up OP. If your friend was important to you, you should have communicated with him directly and clearly. You say you would\u2019ve happily been a groomsman in one of your comments, you just didn\u2019t want to speak. I\u2019m sure your buddy would have accommodated that. I spoke at a friend\u2019s wedding because her maid of honor had stage fright. It\u2019s not that crazy. \n\nBut skipping the ceremony entirely absolutely puts a nail in the coffin for your friendship. You missed a massive moment for him because of you couldn\u2019t just talk to him", "NAH\n\nThis is a really sad situation. Big internet hugs, mate.\n\nI hope you can rebuild your friendship. I can't imagine what it's like having anxiety so crippling.", "YTA and im sorry but your anxiety isnt an excuse at this point. You should have told him directly, not through his fiancee. You shouldn't have lied. And you should have still went. By only going to the night party it probably looked like you didn't care about the wedding and just wanted to get into the drinks and food. \n\nCommunication is key in any kind of relationship, you failed to communicate with him your phobia and failed to show that you support him as a result. Get help for your anxiety before you lose more friends over it.", "YTA as assuming this whole process took a few months, and you never sought out a compromise with your best friend? Or even therapy for why you\u2019d prefer to lose out on these experiences? \nI\u2019d be very honest and apologetic but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they\u2019re very hurt, as it would have come across like you didn\u2019t care about them at all if you couldn\u2019t even talk to them about this", "YTA - Being anxious/terrified of giving speeches is totally understandable. Failing to communicate (almost at all!) with your best friend and then skipping out on the ceremony /wedding is not. You could have avoided this by talking with your friend  - from all accounts, it seems that he just wanted his best friend to be a part of his big day. If you had talked to him about your fears, I am sure you could have come up with a plan that left everyone happy (for example, one of the groomsmen gives the speech).\n\nPerhaps it's not too late and you can reach out to him, with a sincere apology and explain what happened. Hopefully the friendship isn't lost but since you're in the wrong, \\*you\\* need to be the one to contact him, instead of waiting to hear from him.", "YTA. You f\u2019ed up. \n\nLearn how to communicate. You don\u2019t have to do things that make you feel anxious and overwhelmed. But you do have to give a small effort into telling the people you care about why things are going down the way they are.\n\nThis is how we find compromise in life. \n\nSo instead of being there for your best friend and not giving a speech (which of course would have been an option), you just noped right out of the whole thing.

Yikes.", "YTA man. I'm sorry your anxiety keeps you from being there for your best friend but you really dropped the ball there. He wanted you there.

As an adult sometimes you have to do things that aren\u2019t comfortable in order to hold on to relationships and this was one of them.", "I get it, sort of. I am amazing in any situation where I'm in front of a faceless crowd. The \"crowd\" is a different beast than a group of people I need to interact with on a human level. Idk it's weird. You just put on your DJ public persona and if people don't like it then they don't like the DJ, no reflection on you. \n\nBut you skipped the entire wedding? You didn't even communicate, \"that's terrifying for me, but I support you, can I just be a guest?\"\n\nThat's a YTA man. \n\nI feel your anxiety, but anxiety doesn't excuse zero communication. You essentially ghosted your friend and that sucks.", "Then NTA: if he doesn\u2019t want to be your friend, because you couldn\u2019t handle being his best man. Then he wasn\u2019t your best friend to begin with, and just move on from this friendship.", "He was a groomsman for another friend before this", "This is supposedly your best friend and yet not once did you actually speak to him through this entire process, but spoke to his fianc\u00e9e?\n\nYTA. Take losing this friendship as the giant warning sign to get some professional help for your social anxieties - this goes far beyond speech-giving and is impacting your life and those around you.", "You literally say in another comment \u201cI would\u2019ve quite happily been a groomsman\u201d. So which is it?", "Should have make a compromise, be the best man and in all the behind the scenes, but won't do a speech at the reception, they could chose another people to make speeches or maybe record your speech at home and do a mix of something creative that wouldn't requiere you to speak to the crowd, you should have negotiated, that way the ball would be in their court, if they said no, then at least you tried to compromise, instead you straight up refuse. \n\nYTA", "YTA and you need to go into some sort of treatment for your anxiety and inability to communicate. There were so many opportunities here to tell the truth and work out a plan that left everyone comfortable and happy. Your anxiety has now cost you the most important friendship in your life. It this isn\u2019t the tipping point for you to finally do something to address it, then I don\u2019t know what would be.", "@op\n\nHonestly?\n\nNTA.\n\nAnxiety is debilitating. Harshly so depending on how severe anxiety gets for you.\nIt's disabling and it's not your fault.\nAnxiety literally causes flight, fight, freeze or (the fourth one I forget) and you apparently are pre-dispositioned towards freeze.\n\nEven talking about it. Trying to talk about it. It can be a hurdle so large one might rather suicide than having to withstand it.\n\nI'm sorry you have to go through things like this. \nAre you seeking help?\nFrom a therapist and perhaps getting some medication for this?\nAre you moving your body?\nAnxiety is a response to stress.\nOne of the easiest ways to relieve anxiety is to move. Like, until you have a hard time drawing breath. Get your heart pumping.\n\nFrom what you write, you need help in some way. Seek it. \nIt does get better. There are strategies to handle anxiety. It doesn't go away but the intensity can be lessened significantly.", "I'm going against the grain and saying NTA, but for this:\n\n>  She told me not to be stupid and just do it.\n\nShe totally invalidated OP and acted like this was something he was doing on purpose.", "YTA. Not much of a best friend are you?! And you\u2019re still expecting them to reach out to you?!\n\nCOMMUNICATE!!!!!!", "YTA\n\nYou could have not given a speech.... or either way, had a long, honest conversation with him about a way it could be possible for you. \n\nIt doesn't seem like you did that.", "OP, as an introvert myself I understand where you are coming from. I was with you until I read you didn't make an effort to be a part of the wedding at all. If a friend did this, I would be crushed. I would be thinking this person does not care about being in my life at all. Phobias get the best of us but it's also not an excuse to be an asshole. The best way for you to go about it is call your best friend. If that doesn't work, send a letter. You're most likely going to have to do way more than that so be prepared.  From now on, let this be a lesson to you instead of an excuse. If this something you can't handle at all, seek therapy. If you don't, you must be ready to be accountable for your actions.", "So - you could be the best man without doing a speech. The best course of action would have been to talk to your friend about your decision and why you are making it then see if there where work arounds. I would imaging that it was hurtful for him to ask you and you just give a flat no instead of just telling him what the problem was.", "How old are you??? The speech is such a minor part of being a best man. It\u2019s about the friendship and support and just being there for him. The bonding and time you guys could\u2019ve spent together preparing for his wedding is irreplaceable and you don\u2019t seem to have any thoughts about anything except an unnecessary speech. You couldn\u2019t have made their wedding more about you\u2026", "YTA tenfold, don\u2019t bother him anymore. You aren\u2019t a good friend at all.", "YTA\n\nI sympathize with you about the phobia, but couldn't you have tried to reach a compromise about it? You could still have been his best man and had a different groomsman give the speech. Hell, you could even have still written it and had a different groomsman read it for you with the excuse of not being emotionally able to read it out loud yourself (the crowd would just assume too much joy for your friend and it's not technically incorrect).\n\nAnd to skip the wedding basically entirely? That is without a doubt an AH move since attending doesn't touch on your phobia of speaking in public. You completely fucked that up and I'm very sorry for you losing your best friend over this when you could have just talked to him (not his now wife) about it and found a compromise.", "I have the same issues as you when it comes to crowds, only when an acquaintance asked me to be his best man (after many said no) I made the mistake of saying yes. I didn't want to hurt their feelings if I refused. It was a disaster and it's not something I will ever do again!", "I understand the anxiety since I would feel that way myself. Maybe not to the degree you did but I do think I get it. You should have forced yourself into going to his wedding even if you were in panic mode because he was your friend and that's what a friend would do. You should have also tried to explain yourself better. You should be trying to apologize right now and if he doesn't accept it so be it but you definitely should try to make amends.", "YTA. You lied about why you didn't want to be the best man. Then gave the real reason. Communicated that to his fiancee instead of himself. Why you couldn't pick up the phone and call your friend or meet him for lunch or drinks to explain is beyond me. You could have offered to be the best man but refused to give a speech. I'm sure someone else could have given a speech in your place. (ie. the army friend that took your place). You could have offered to be a groomsman instead. You then didn't even bother to show up at his wedding. That probably hurt him pretty bad. There are so many better ways this could have been handled and you probably handled it the worst way possible.", "I\u2019m actually thinking cautious NTA and I\u2019m putting it up because there\u2019s so many YTAs. I feel like the level of anxiety mixed with the fianc\u00e9s response might have really mixed this one up. \n\nSeems like OP got terrified at the idea of best man duties, and before he could take a day or two to figure out how to explain to friend, fianc\u00e9 climbed right up his butt with why-being-so-difficult and don\u2019t-be-stupid and just-do-it. This might easily have triggered big insecurities and fears about being treated *just this way* over a phobia. If fianc\u00e9 is behaving this way then might friend?? If you\u2019re already phobic and now overwhelmed I can see a person really struggling to deal and running for the hills. Shame and anxiety, while being told you\u2019re screwing up, are a powerful combination. \n\nThat\u2019s the feeling I\u2019m getting from story and tone. OP if you feel that fits, it might be worth reaching out to friend (don\u2019t bother with fianc\u00e9 for now we know what she feels about such things) and trying to explain your phobia, and that you got a bit triggered by the request and then suddenly overwhelmed by fianc\u00e9\u2019s well-meaning (being diplomatic here) attempts to bring you on board, and amidst all of that you failed to overcome your anxiety sufficiently to reach out and that you\u2019re really sorry. Essentially *my baggage fucked me up and I let you down man, I\u2019m really sorry*. If it fits, maybe try it.", "YTA, the friendship ending is entirely your fault.  You couldn't even go as a guest. You made it clear to them that you truly don't care for them. If you did you would've at least gone to the wedding.  You'll probably lose a few more friends over this.", "You came here expecting to be excused for your anxiety. How you handled this is inexcusable. Speaking directly to your best friend and accepting and asking to not give a speech would have met everyone\u2019s needs. At every turn you failed your best friend.", "YTA. All you had to do is say no speech. Literally no one would have been paying attention to you, they\u2019ll be looking at the couple. Your an adult time to suck it up and do things your not the most happy about. You missed the whole thing because of this?! FR? He should be posed.", "What? What am I missing here? This can\u2019t be all of it. \n\nSo, you said \u201cno\u201d to the bride when your best friend asked you to be the best man, you didn\u2019t talk to him about your fear of public speaking, and then you didn\u2019t even bother going to the wedding??? What?? And that\u2019s your best friend???!!! \n\nThere are so many so many different ways you could have handled this. To include: TALKING and being TRUTHFUL to the groom, getting someone else to do the speech, ATTENDING the ceremony, yeah, getting over yourself for one day, etc. I can go on for days. \n\nYou are the worst type of friend. The one who is too lazy and self centered to try and work anything out. Yes, of course you lost your friend. As you should have!!! He deserves better. He deserves a true friend who will stand by him at one of the most important days of his life. \n\nAnd of course YTA!!!!", "Eh\u2026 I get the friend not knowing about the phobia/ not realizing the implications. A buddy of mine got married and asked me to read a passage during the ceremony. I also am TERRIFIED of public speaking, but I figured it was important to he and his wife. We had dinner a bit later and we\u2019re talking about the ceremony and how I looked a bit pale. Yea\u2026 I\u2019ve known him since high school and he had no idea about my fears when he asked and I didn\u2019t say anything because I thought he knew \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", ">conseauences\n\nr/excgarated", "That's literally exactly what they did. They asked someone else. How is ops friend Ana asshole here", "When would this happen? At the 2nd wedding?", "You know, when I was younger I lied a lot to get out of things, hurting myself and others. It didn\u2019t occur to me until reading your comment that it was likely connected to social anxiety.\n\nThank you.", ">It's not exactly voluntary behavior. Not that it makes it okay, it doesn't. But knowing it's not voluntary does help both the person doing it and the ones affected by it.\n\nI was like OP in high school... I feel like the part where he got to skip on presentations and stuff was kind of voluntary. He mentions drugs (meds?), but no therapy or something like that. This condition is clearly interfering with his life, education and relationships and he's voluntarily doing nothing about it?\n\nThere's a very fine line between having a condition that negatively impacts your life despite treatment or for now while being treated, and a condition you just accept and act like it's normal to hurt everyone around you because of it...\n\nOP, I feel for you, but please get some help...", ">had already caused him enough trouble, so going to the ceremony wasn't something I could do. I didn't want to fuck up his big day more than I already had.\n\nI would be disappointed if my best friend refused to be my MOH, but if she flat out didn't show to my ceremony? That would kill me. You say you didn't want to fuck up his day even more than you already had but that's exactly what you did. You made it so much more worse.", "hi! i have severe anxiety and agoraphobia! op is TA. he had nor had a reason to lie to his friend, and also continue to lie in the comments to people; being straight forward with a friend is what you do in friends, communication\n\nYTA, op, be a better friend", "Wrong. I have severe anxiety , I still got up and gave the dam speech for my brother. I get it. It\u2019s tough it sucks, but to totally bail on the wedding? From best man to not attending the ceremony bc of anxiety? That\u2019s when it\u2019s not ok.", "Are you medicated at all for your social anxiety? Could you not have taken a Xanax before going to the reception to calm yourself down enough to be able to give just a short speech? Idk man if it\u2019s affecting your life this much that it\u2019s ruining friendships and causing you to isolate yourself from others during social gatherings and have panic attacks, then you need to see a psychiatrist and get on meds. I say this as someone who has diagnosed panic disorder.", "So what's the problem? You got exactly what you asked for", "I like to say that anxiety is a reason, not an excuse or an apology. We are still responsible for the harm we do due to it and have to own up. We are also responsible for coping and finding help, and honestly... OP reminds me of my friend. Always negative, always talking about their anxiety and how severe it is and getting accommodations (not having to do presentations). I truly hope that's where the similarities end \u2013 my friend is always drowning in self-pity and negative self-talk, won't seek help. Apparently medication (the 1 type they had) makes them sick and therapy does nothing... But from what they said, they were uncooperative with therapists and then gave up when it wasn't helping.\n\nI truly hope OP doesn't share these traits with my friend... He'd be jeopardizing his own chances at getting any better and being able to live a relatively normal live, maintain friendships etc. But his comments make me feel like \"but I have anxiety\" is their go-to. :/", "He started with the objectively false and stupid excuse of the kilt. If you want to blame anyone, that's still on OP because after that why would anyone believe him?", "Weak, weak, weak. \n\nThat\u2019s pathetic, OP.", "So you trusted his fiancee to tell him your reasons? After she was rotten to you and called you names? I don\u2019t think she actually told him OP, she probably lied to him or didn\u2019t bother explaining.\n\nYou owe it to both your friend and yourself to talk with him one-on-one about what happened.", "So, again, he's better without people that take a white lie as an excuse to not believe him.", "That's very much stretching the definition of a white lie. And in a situation where for *OP's best friend* he should be truthful.\n\nFrom any angle, OP's the one who didn't treat his friend as a friend first. If he's not doing that, how can be expect or demand anything in return?", "Have you ever read the post? People under stress can show a random behavioiru Anyawys, agree to disagree. Bye.", "At least you won't ever see them again! That should help", ">So when i got dressed down by my friends mother during the reception, it confirmed everything I had been feeling\n\nIt was a self-fulfilling prophecy, you do realize that, right?"]}
