The amount of misinformation in this post and responses is astounding.", "YTA.  As someone who was diagnosed with celiac in her 40\u2019s, I ate gluten for nearly 40 years.

Let them bring dishes the daughter will eat. Gluten free is a want for some but others it is a have to. Regardless, they offered to bring a dish she can eat.

This is a very petty hill to die on and you are creating unnecessary drama. The way I see it you have 4 options:\n\n1) Host the dinner and don\u2019t let them bring a separate dish. This will make you a complete AH because now one of your guests can\u2019t eat most things and will be left out. People will definitely make an issue out of it and it will create tension. \n\n2) Host the dinner and let them bring a separate dish. Worst possible outcome is your wife is offended because she doesn\u2019t receive *as much* praise as you feel she deserves for her cooking while your sister does. \n\n3) Host the dinner and your wife makes a few extra dishes to accommodate your niece. Obviously it adds more work, but sister and niece are happy (hopefully) and your wife no longer has to worry about being outshone by your sister or feeling resentful that your sister is being competitive. Drama avoided!\n\n4) Throw up your hands, say screw it and have someone else host. This will lead to drama later because people feel like it was your turn and you shoved it off on others for a petty reason.\n\nChoose option 2 or 3 and save yourself and everyone else the drama!!!!", "YTA - \n \nI\u2019m not saying you should make everything gluten free.

No. They test you and you have to eat gluten.", "McCormick makes a really good gf gravy mix! And aldi had gf crunchy onions if you like green bean casserole (you just have to make your own cream of mushroom soup)", "Bria would be safer not trusting her host to act in her interest. Their futzing around and being sloppy or stupid can evoke a very painful reaction in her body, if she's celiac.  Very AH thinking here on the part of the host.", "\"I told her I did not want to make my my wife uncomfortable with her competitive bs, because my sister has a HISTORY OF doing this.\" Dietary accommodations are things you mention when invited, or 30 days in advance if this is a tradition.

My family never did the whole \u201cone person makes the meal\u201d thing anyway, we just always had somebody be responsible for one or two dishes to share the load. My cousin is a Celiac and while we tried to accommodate her at first, she eventually said \u201cy\u2019all don\u2019t have the experience making this stuff and it tastes like shit, I appreciate the effort but I am not bothered at all to bring my own meal\u201d. And we all heaved a sigh of relief because \u201cGF versions\u201d of recipes just don\u2019t exist sometimes and it\u2019s a special science to make it not garbage lol. \n\nLike I don\u2019t understand what the issue is, I\u2019m happy to let people bring their own food because then it\u2019s less work for me, and I don\u2019t have to worry about if I made it right/it tastes good/didn\u2019t get accidentally cross contaminated/etc. Win-win in my opinion.", "i developed crohns at 27 when i had my son, the pregnancy activated it is how it was explained after the fact (was diagnosed at 30 when i just couldnt handle the pain anymore and saw a specialist) i agree, shit happens and bodies change, what someone eats 10 years ago may not be able to eat now.", "My boss was 35", "Fun fact about the lactose free you can [engineer a virus to make your stomach cells produce lactase if you want to](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aoczYXJeMY4).", "I developed lactose intolerance in my teens. I ate dairy for years with enzyme pills (like Lactaid,) and my level of intolerance (and therefore, how much enzyme I needed, and how much dairy I could eat) waxed and waned over time. And then all of a sudden a couple of years ago (I'm early 40s,) I developed some other issue with eating dairy that wasn't fixed by taking enzyme pills, and can't eat it any more. Food tolerance isn't static over time.", "Yep. Not that it stops me from eating dairy products ;\\_; My Hubris looks like cheese.", "Yup, diagnosed in my late 20s celiac here. Believe me, I used to eat cake and bread and every other damn thing, now I eat none. It's a huge pain in the butt for me. The fact that the mom is willing to bring something so that the wife doesn't have to accommodate her is very helpful and nice. OP is YTA for being a jerk about it.", "My dad got diagnosed with Celiac at the ripe age of 63 after a long period of gut issues and unexplained weight loss. \n\nHe certainly gets seriously sick if his food is contaminated even a bit. He spent at least the first 55 years of his life happily eating all the bread he could find.", "It\u2019s crazy! It\u2019s almost like the only way you\u2019d know you had an issue with a food item is if you\u2019d eaten it, and it caused problems! Shame on her and her doctors for not being psychic.", "That's like when people question my lactose intolerance because in the past I easily ate ice cream and pizza. No I assure you today if I ate even a single slice cheese pizza within half an hour I'd on the toilet praying to the porcelain gods to just take me now.\n\nThankfully for me lactase pills are a thing and do work for me so I can enjoy all the cheesy pizza I want.", "Many people put turkeys in a bag before cooking it and have flour in the bag.

You\u2019re right there are lots of options and it could be way worse. I did mean more the stress it puts on people hosting me. Something this post does not help with.", "It could just be a weird Australian thing. And I can definitely still buy corn starch made from corn - it's clearly labelled on the package - it's just, if I were cooking for someone with a gluten intolerance, I'd have to double check I had the right corn starch.", "The only version of this I can see is someone bringing a whole other turkey to Thanksgiving when the host is providing the turkey. That would be rude. \n\nMy family does a form of potluck where the host makes the entree and everyone else brings Sides and desserts. But even then we have about half the family prefers ham to turkey, and the host either make both or asks someone to bring the other. \n\nMy husband\u2019s family didn\u2019t do pot lucks until I suggested it to help my MIL, and now it\u2019s the preferred way to holiday.

Gonna disapear down this rabbit hole for a while.", "One of my close friends developed celiac at the beginning of the pandemic, but since everyone was scared of going into doctor's offices and getting the virus, and there was a lot of other stuff going on in her life as well, it took her two whole years to figure out what was wrong with her and get diagnosed/treated. During that time, she went from 120 lbs to 80. It was horrible, it felt like she was about to die. Reading OP's dismissive attitude about this is making my blood boil.", "my friend was just diagnosed mid-40s.", "Seriously it took my family and me so long to realize I was lactose intolerant. Once we realized (after I cut milk out for lent and then started to have again) we realized how many symptoms I had shown previously that we just attributed to something else.

Or are you simply assuming?\n\nDo you know for a fact that she hasn\u2019t been diagnosed as gluten intolerant or with celiac\u2019s disease? \n\nAlso, quite often when dealing with gut and skin problems, it is recommended to go on elimination diets and cut out certain food groups etc. to see if this makes a difference.", "I hope you know how much anxiety you\u2019re causing people with food allergies, restrictions, etc. who fear going home for the holidays, who fear people think we\u2019re an inconvenience, secretly hope we won\u2019t come.", "Are you sure that\u2019s the reason? Or is it that she have tried diets to accommodate her problems but none of them have worked so she quit? \n\nBecause I\u2019ve had to do that a lot. To you it might seem like she\u2019s just quitting because they\u2019re no longer fun. People thought I was doing the same thing.
