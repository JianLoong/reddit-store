I shouldn't dress salads with mayonnaise because, in his opinion, it's a plebeian dressing. Onions ruin the flavor of fried potatoes. The cheese soup has \"too much cheese.\" I can't make desserts at all because sugar is bad. He even managed to criticize my great-grandmother's favorite recipe. First you cook the rice, then you boil the eggs, peel them, chop them and fry them together with the rice in a pan. The recipe is simple, but the food turns out VERY tasty, it was my favorite food as a child, and I always asked my great-grandmother to make me \"rice and eggs\". My bil called it a culinary perversion. \n\nBut if you thought that was the cause of the conflict, read a little more. The problem is that he only criticizes food while it's cooking.

Even my mom's Brussels sprouts, which are cooked to mush and basically inedible, I feel like Gordon or Joe would politely force them down, and maybe try to feel her out on whether she was open to learning a better technique, but they're not going to yell like she's some professional who just served them cooked-to-death sprouts.  They aren't horrible people, they just expect better from the folks who purport to *be* better.

Because unless they live out of state you'll presumably be seeing them regularly for family events.

But Gordon comes from an earlier generation of chefs when that *was* the norm, and he makes book presenting that image to the world, and so the reforms have stalled.\n\nAll secondhand info (now thirdhand to you) as I have never worked in the restaurant industry, let alone the high-end fine-dining segment.", "That's great to know!", "NTA.\n\nYour wife should take her \"both sides\" argument somewhere else.\n\nOnly one of you has insulted literally everyone in the group chat.

He might think it\u2019s a funny thing he does and that you enjoy the banter.  Direct, clear communication is best.  Your text was passive aggressive but warranted.  You need to call him, and explain that you find it insulting and offensive and annoying when he criticizes the efforts of you and your friends relating to your cooking, but never contributes.  It\u2019s rude and you don\u2019t want to have him criticizing and questioning what you or your friends cook.  If he wants to bring his own contributions, cooked the way he likes, that would be more than welcome.  But no more ridicule towards your cooking or anyone else\u2019s.

I'm always looking for new ways to eat eggs.", "*He criticizes and ridicules everything.*\n\nThis was your first mistake.

No one should ever let their partner be treated that way. But if she\u2019s too spineless to stand up for you, she certainly has no leg to stand on to criticize you when you do it for yourself.
