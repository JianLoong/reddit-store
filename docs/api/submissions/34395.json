I can't say that I can cook any complicated dishes that require a lot of effort, but I love experimenting with ordinary foods. Besides, I really like to cook according to my great-grandmother's recipes. I was very close to her as a child, so the dishes I cook from her recipes remind me of her. \n\nBut every time I cook, if my bil is around, it becomes a torture. He criticizes and ridicules everything. I shouldn't stuff the meat with fruit because in his opinion, it overpowers the flavor of the meat. I shouldn't dress salads with mayonnaise because, in his opinion, it's a plebeian dressing. Onions ruin the flavor of fried potatoes. The cheese soup has \"too much cheese.\" I can't make desserts at all because sugar is bad. He even managed to criticize my great-grandmother's favorite recipe. First you cook the rice, then you boil the eggs, peel them, chop them and fry them together with the rice in a pan. The recipe is simple, but the food turns out VERY tasty, it was my favorite food as a child, and I always asked my great-grandmother to make me \"rice and eggs\". My bil called it a culinary perversion. \n\nBut if you thought that was the cause of the conflict, read a little more. The problem is that he only criticizes food while it's cooking. After the dish he so berated is cooked, he EATS MORE THEN EVERYONE. It always drove me crazy. First he says the food I cook is too plain, too plebeian, too perverted, too much mayonnaise/cheese/sugar, that he won't eat it, that I might not even offer him a taste, and then he says, \"All right, I'll have a bite\" and eats three times as much as all the other people. \n\nTo make a long story short, it's my birthday soon, my anniversary. My friends and I decided to have a small party and agreed that we would each cook one dish. We created a group chat on watsapp where we discussed all the details of the party preparation. My bil was also in this group chat, although I immediately felt that it was a bad idea. I was right. When we started discussing what dishes we were going to cook, he again started criticizing every, literally every dish. He criticized not only my ideas, but everyone else's as well. I could see that my friends were uncomfortable, but they didn't want to confront him. Finally, my patience broke when my bil wrote that he would certainly not try anything from our dishes, but let us calculate the portions for him as well, \"So be it.\" \n\nWell, that was the last straw for me. I wrote directly into the group chat, \"Dear bil, since you eat more than everyone else every time, the food you said you wouldn't try, please bring your own, \nNORMAL dishes and eat them at the party.\"\n\nI guess by his subsequent silence, I had insulted him. \n\nMy wife, who of course has also been in this chat room, says her brother can be too rude, but I have also acted unwisely.", "created_utc": 1704474246, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18zbr3f/aita_for_saying_my_brotherinlaw_should_bring_his/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
