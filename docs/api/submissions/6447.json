It\u2019s nice to see people taking that seriously", "NTA don't give it to her.  I'm 42 (f) married.  It's about $70 in my area for grooming.  The occassional vet bill as dogs get older I had some of her teeth pulled $300.00 food about $45 a month (small dog).

There's a lot going on here that a phycologist would have a field day with I think....but I digress...let's get to the topic you were asking about...cougar wants a puppy. \n\nNTA -\n\nYOUR puppies. You are obligated to find good homes for them. A good home means someone who can be there for the puppy, play with it, feed it, groom it, get it vaccines, vet care etc.  She does NOT sound someone who would be a good, responsible pet owner. Pets take a lot of work and some take a lot more money than you think they will (trust me I KNOW, lol).   If you have 3 pups and your parents take 1 and you keep 2 - problem solved. lol. But if you need to find a home for 1 of them tell her she can apply but you will give the pup to the most qualified individual or family that applies - because it's what's best for the pup, not someone that just has an urge to to have it.  Good luck to you.", "NTA. They\u2019re your puppies, and they should go to someone who can take care of them.", "NTA not everyone in the home is onboard for owning a dog!", "NTA but you would be if you let her have the puppy. That lil creature is relying on you right now to keep it from going somewhere it can\u2019t be properly cared for. What you want to do is definitely the right thing!!", "NTA, they\u2019re your dogs and you decide where they go, BUT this is not your fight. It sounds like your brother needs to be the one to communicate with his girlfriend, especially on matters this important. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t get a dog from you, and he doesn\u2019t explain that HE doesn\u2019t want a dog, then nothing is stopping her from finding another dog elsewhere.", "NTA.  Please advocate for the pups and find a responsible owner, as the pups are unable to speak up for themselves.  As she (and your brother? ) are already calling you names, please find another home for the pom--I can only imagine how she will treat the pup when it inevitably misbehaves.", "NTA. And the fact that they regularly call you bitch and asshole is abusive. Forget the dog just cut them all off.", "NTA. You are not obligated to give the puppy to anyone. And if she isn\u2019t working and can\u2019t afford to take care of it, it would be cruel to the dog to give it to her. \n\nDon\u2019t fall for the \u201cattitude\u201d bit. That is them trying to manipulate you into doing what they want.", "First off NTA at all. Second wtf are your parents thinking is okay for a predator to be dating and living off of your brother. Not going to lie I am in my 40\u2019s and a single widow and have dated younger men and women but that age gap with a teenager. I just threw up in my mouth so gross \ud83e\udd22 I have a rule if they are closer in age to my daughter not happening. Not to yuck anyones yum but damnnnn. Also breadwinner in family, the teenager, does not want it so yeah no.

Simple as that. It isn't fair to the dog because they can't be taken care of properly.
