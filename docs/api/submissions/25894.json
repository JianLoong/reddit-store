Forcing you into sexual situations you are uncomfortable with is rape and made me sick to my stomach even reading, I can\u2019t imagine living with that. He\u2019s also using emotional manipulation on you. This was a choice he made and it sounds like you have done your very best to be there for him. Honestly if he actually loved you he would understand and respect your feelings and let you leave gracefully. Get out of there as fast as you can and protect yourself bc he sounds unstable.", "Take it from a trans man. You won\u2019t be the asshole for leaving.

Also, being coerced is rape", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are fine to end the relationship any time you like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTransitioning alone would be a good reason - you are fine only to have relationships with girls if that is your thing. Nothing wrong with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut even without transitioning: As you diescribe it, this behavioral change and neglect of you is a god reason for a break up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: all in all, you would not even NEED a reason.

You\u2019re not attracted to him anymore and he\u2019s not allowed to guilt trip you to stay with him. That is not the way to build or maintain a relationship. Stand your ground and let him know that this is not something that you want and that the relationship is over. Doesn\u2019t make you transphobic or an AH.", "NTA. Forcing you into sex is unacceptable. Period. I don't understand why you were putting yourself through what was essentially conversion therapy, either. As soon as Richy knew he was a man, that was it. You can love someone deeply, care for them deeply, but it doesn't change that you're just not into men.\n\nYou can stay someone who is a pillar of support in his life, as his friend. It makes no sense that he's expecting you to 1. somehow be into men all of a sudden, and 2. just disappear instead of staying close. If you don't want to stay friends, that's fine, but I'm unclear on why that's the immediate expectation.", "NTA\n\nYou were supportive of his transition and have tried to make it work, but literally and figuratively he is not the same person you were when you met. \n\nBreak ups are common in times of transition (hence having a \"college boyfriend\" or a \"high school sweetheart\"). This transition is one that your relationship couldn't withstand (yes, that's a pun).\n\nFrom what you've written here, it sounds like you respect your partner and his wishes, and you've put in significant effort into trying to see if a relationship is possible, but it isn't what you want. \n\nYou are entitled to your desires just like he is entitled to his desires. You aren't an asshole for falling out of love with someone.", "NTA. Your STBX's lack of support system is not your responsibility nor your problem. He cannot continue to be codependent on you.

They are toxic and abusive and manipulative. It may be part of adaptive and over correcting but it's absolutely not your job to be a doormat to them and you aren't remotely responsible for them in any way.", "NTA. You are not into men. It's as simple as that. You can offer support as a friend, but you don't have to be a lover.", "NTA Dude this is so toxic. You\u2019re straight, he\u2019s a guy, and you not being into him honestly validates his gender identity more than anything. \n\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t tie yourself down to someone you aren\u2019t attracted to and who clearly doesn\u2019t value you as a person. If he did, he would understand and be supportive of your choice to let go of the relationship. Instead, you\u2019ve become an object of sorts: you\u2019re the emotional support animal, so to speak. He knows you don\u2019t like men but he keeps you around for the sake of his own emotional needs like he would a pet. He knows you don\u2019t like bottoming but he does it to make himself feel better/pleased as if you\u2019re an object. YOU don\u2019t truly matter to him, only what you can do FOR him.\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry man, but it seems like your partner has taken the worst aspects of the Alpha Chad toxic masculinity pack and equipped them to his kit. Permanently, possibly.\n\n\nGet out of this relationship as soon as you\u2019re safe and able to, and don\u2019t let him emotionally manipulate you anymore. You deserve better, and you deserve someone you\u2019re attracted to and who values *your* feelings and comforts, too.\n\n\nEDITED for phrasing because after I read it over I realized it could be taken weird.", "NTA. Sounds like Richy here decided that getting a dick means being one too. \n\nAs a bisexual and gender-fluid queer person, I\u2019m here to say being trans doesn\u2019t preclude you from being an asshole.

You do not coerce your partner into sex acts they do not enjoy I don't care what the gender make-up or number of people in the partnership is. Even IF you like men this is still enough for you to leave a relationship. Don't let this toxic being guilt you into staying.

He genuinely doesn't have anyone. He's very secluded person who basically does what he wants then comes home and either spends time with me or spends time in our \"space\" which is his safe space.

People \"want\" a lot of things,  but that doesnt mean we always get what we want. You have an absolute right to say no to someone using your body and having your no be respected. Ritchie is an asshole for guilt tripping and manipulating you.", "It is rape. By the numbers. You can be raped in a marriage.", "Yes it\u2019s okay to leave him alone, that\u2019s something he will need to figure out on his own as an adult. You get literally one chance at this life. It would be sad for you to waste the most precious thing you have, time, in a toxic relationship with someone you are not attracted to and will just resent. This isn\u2019t you leaving someone bc they gained some weight or something, this is a different person in every way from who you met. Don\u2019t let him emotionally manipulate you into staying bc you are the only person he\u2019s clinging to. Good luck!", "At worst it's rape. At BEST it's abuse. Run don't walk.", "This is going to be a little cold but, that is not your responsibility. Genuinely not your responsibility. Richy is an adult who is perfectly capable of having connections and making friends. Actually sounds like a lot of pressure put on you to be the only person in their life. That's kind of unfair to you don't you think?", "\"but Richy genuinely will have nobody once I leave.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu still should not give your life up and stay in a relationship JUST BECAUSE OF THAT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe will make new friends.", "I don't think you would be the asshole for leaving to pursue what you want. \n\nYou said that he transitioned knowing your sexuality. He should have known that you leaving was a possibility, rather than thinking that he would \"change\" you.\n\nWe don't have all the details here, but again, from what you've written it sounds like you didn't try to dissuade him from his transition. You were supportive of him and what he wants. And now, he should do the same for you.\n\nI understand that it's hard to leave when you feel like you're abandoning someone. Depending on the nature of y'all's situation (sounds like you're living together?), maybe you can take a break from being romantically/sexually involved and you can start to date other people while he starts to make friends and build a support system. \n\nI think regardless, you should make it abundantly clear that he *needs* to build out some sort of support system. Of course being judged is scary, but isn't that part of being human? Being vulnerable is the only way to build relationships and meaningful connections. It isn't fair of him to ask you to be his only support if that isn't what you want, and it isn't healthy for him to have no one either. You can encourage him AND you don't have to be the only person that's there for him."]}
