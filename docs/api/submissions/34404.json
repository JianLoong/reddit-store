I just feel stupid and hurt now. I explained to him how that made me feel and he with an attitude was like okay well go to that city a few hours away then. I don\u2019t think he understands that I want him to want to go and do things like this with me. Not make me feel like I\u2019m forcing him to.

You don\u2019t feel like he puts in much effort, he doesn\u2019t want to go on trips with you (even small ones) yet he jumps at the chance to do so with his friends, and he\u2019ll only agree to travel with you with reluctance and attitude. I think you have your answer.", "NTA.\n\nDoesn't sound like he wanted a gf in the first place. You need to evaluate where you are in life and where he is. I know its only four years, but in that time during the 20's it is literally a world of difference. Talk to him, and if you all do not see eye to eye, then you have a decision to make.", "NTA, put he's clearly not that into you. I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but you know that. It's time to get gone.", "NTA but you\u2019re wasting your time here. \n\nHe is 4 years younger than you. Not a parent and in a totally different stage of his life than you. \n\nEverything you\u2019ve said points to him not wanting to be with you. Bite the bullet and find someone who does.", "NTA\n\nAnd if he's being this weird and distant this early in the relationship, it won't get better. You might want to consider cutting bait sooner rather than later.", "Unfortunately i think you have your answer here. \n\nYou're NTA but its not going to get any better, you make all the effort, he doesn't want to do things with you, but will happily put effort into friends. \n\nmaybe its time to move on", "NTA - but the writing is on the wall here.", "NTA. Put your foot down and prepare to cut ties. No use putting effort when it's not being returned.", "NTA. Honey. He's just not that into you. He has it easy with you. Bc of your life he doesn't have to put in the effort. It's not your fault but you're almost 30 with a kid and he can't even rent a car in most states. M\nYou're on different wave lengths. He's 24 and wants to have fun. \n\nGo find yourself someone more suited to you.", "Info: when you\u2019re wanting to vacation with him, will the kid(s) come with you too?", "You are trying harder than him. That\u2019s clear. You aren\u2019t an AH for being upset, but if it doesn\u2019t change you will have to review the relationship.", "He is showing you exactly what he values and what he does not value. Sadly OP, you fall into the second category. \n\nAs Maya Angelou so wisely wrote: \"When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time\". \n\nYour boyfriend has been showing you over and over again that he does not value you, but he is probably using you. If you continue with this relationship, you are only going to continue to hurt yourself and waste time on someone that does not love, respect, or deserve you. Say goodbye to him and find someone that will love and care for you. \n\nNTA.", "Info:\n\nIsn't it just possible that your idea of fun trips and his just aren't the same?  The examples you gave of him liking, skiing and camping, are different than going to a city or to the Keys.   \n\nHave you tried asking him to plan a weekend getaway WITH you? Or have you just decided where YOU want to go and wanted him to join YOUR trip?  Because if its only the latter, then it seems that you just want to go where you want to go, not go someplace you'd both enjoy. \n\nAnd what was your NYE plan?  Was it sitting home with your kids?  I mean, if you give a 24 year old the choice of sitting home with you and some kids, or going to a party, he will probably choose the party. \n\nYour feelings are valid, but I'd be curious how much you are looking at his feelings too.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like you both have different relationship goals.  You are looking for a partner, and he is focused on having fun with his friends.  \n\nIf he is not willing to put more effort into your relationship, I would say it's time to move on.", "He\u2019s using you as a back up", "NTA - Hon, he's just not that into you. Move on.", "You\u2019re four years his older, which is not per se a significant difference at your age, but you\u2019re also a mother. He does not seem ready to have a relationship with someone older with kids. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s immature, but you seem to want different things.", "NTA.  But neither is he.  He\u2019s 24.  Way too young for a committed relationship.  He still doesn\u2019t know what he wants out of life.   You on the other hand have been forced by fate to seek something more \u2018settled\u2019.  Chalk it up to incompatibility at this stage in your lives.", "NTA\n\nUp to you to decide what it means if your relationship is generally good in other ways.\n\nThis is what I'd refer to as a 'pin in the board'.  Alone, not enough to make a big deal about... however in combination with other things that show he's not into you might start to add up to a problem.\n\nHe's 24... his brain isn't even fully developed.\n\nhttps://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-teen-brain-7-things-to-know#:\\~:text=The%20brain%20finishes%20developing%20and,prioritizing%2C%20and%20making%20good%20decisions.", "NTA but here's the thing I never got into my head until I learned it the hard way.\n\nPeople really do prioritise what is important.\n\nI had a fiance who was like this.  He would happily prioritise what HE wanted to do, and when it came to me it was always either brushed off, forgotten about or outright no.  If we did do something I wanted then he'd complain and make me feel on edge.\n\nMy advice to you is wholeheartedly just go with your kids, don't even ask him.  Start living youur life for you and do not expect him to come along with you.  You've said it yourself, he's prioritised going out with his friends, going away with his friends etc but I am pretty sure he's still got you sat there in case he wants sex or whatever else he fancies at any given time.  \n\nYou don't have to dump him, but start making plans for you and your kids, or even just yourself! If he complains then your answer is \"oh i asked you before and you said no so I just decided to go anyway\".", "Get rid of him and find someone who wants to be around you. He sounds like a jerk who only wants what he wants. There are tons of guys out there who are trying so hard to find someone like you. Why is it that they always want to be with the jerks instead of the one that would worship just the chance to have a fulfilling relationship.", "NTA, you asked him for a trip away twice and he said no. He clearly enjoys going away with friends. I would start wondering if he's actually committed to being in a relationship with you. I'm sorry, it sucks when you're the only one making an effort. There are great men out there who will want to make you a priority and take special trips with you on your birthday.", "Thanks everyone. Basically what I thought\u2026but I was hoping I was wrong.", "He likes to go on fun vacations with his friends, he doesn't like vacationing with you. Those are the facts. You aren't an ah for being upset and hurt about them, but at the end of the day you are going to have to live with them. \n\nA nice first step would be asking him what kind of trips he'd enjoy, since apparently he's into snowboarding and camping but not into going to a city or Florida.\n\nNAH.", "You're NTA for being upset and hurt that your boyfriend doesn't want to travel alone with you but you are an AH for thinking that you can force him to do these things with you, when he clearly isn't into it.

Not sure of his financial situation but perhaps he can\u2019t afford a trip right now, but can afford to snowboard, go camping, and do other low cost activities. I was broke asf when I was 24.", "Nta, it sounds like you're putting more effort into this relationship than him.", "He's not interested in this.  It seems like you think this relationship is deeper than he does.  Or maybe he just has different aspirations when it comes to vacationing.", "NTA - Four years isn\u2019t a huge age difference, but in this situation I think you have a massive stage-of-life and maturity divide. You have kids to think about. When you have time to yourself, you want to enjoy a romantic couple\u2019s getaway. You want to settle down in a lot of ways.\n\nThis dude doesn\u2019t. I mean, it took almost a year to make your relationship official. For him, he wants adventure and his friends are more important to them than you. A snowboard or camping adventure with his friends sounds way more fun than a weekend in the keys with his gf. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s wrong for that, but it\u2019s objectively where he\u2019s at in his life. And it\u2019s not just his age - plenty of guys that age prioritize their SO. He just isn\u2019t doing it!\n\nYou are within your rights to be upset, but I think you need to really look at this and see if he\u2019s even capable of meeting your expectations at this current stage. He could be a great guy, but if he isn\u2019t ready to prioritize you, it\u2019s time to move on.", "You might want to try seeing someone with a kid, he is in the wrong lifestyle currently.", "NTA - maybe he doesn't know you're his girlfriend. \n\nINFO: how was it \"made official\" back in June or July?\n\nHe's 24. He didn't spend new years with you. He doesn't want to go on vacations with you. He might not be all that interested in you.", "NTA.  His priorities are different from yours.  And at his age, i seriously think that won\u2019t change anytime soon.  If you don\u2019t like being placed second to his friends, you need to rethink this relationship. Since it\u2019s the start of the new year, it might be a good time to start fresh with a new bf.", "Nta he dont like women", "It sounds like he enjoys going on trips and stuff, just not with you. Which really sucks. And would make me think about the relationship. NTA", "NTA. This frat boy is using you for sex.", "Why are you with him?", "What do you expect from a 24 year old dude? You guys are one two separate mentalities when it comes to life. I suggest looking for someone a bit older and more mature.", "NTA but he is probably avoiding too much commitment.  My assumption is that he likes you, but by avoiding a trip with you, he avoids things getting to be too serious.  You have kids and are in a vastly different headspace.  You deserve a better man.", "NTA - but he is for leading you on and treating you like you don\u2019t matter.\n\nHe\u2019s using you, he sees being with you as him getting sex on tap without actually having to go out and make the effort to find a girl who\u2019ll be up for a one night stand, every time he\u2019s horny", "NTA.  Dont be surprised if there is someone else. This has all the flags. \n\n\" I dont think he understands that I want him to do these things with me\"...honey, he understands, he just doesn't care.\n\nYou deserve better.", "At least I'm not the only one who can se it.\n\nThe old fashioned term for your bf  is \"a good time charlie\".

It would be just me and him.", "I want to go to the keys for me yes, but to fish and snorkel. Which is what he loves to do. When I ask to do these things with him, I\u2019m thinking of him, not just me.\nI wasn\u2019t really upset about New Year\u2019s Eve, I figured he go to his friends since I was home with my girls. It\u2019s just hurtful how quickly he said yes to his friends and no to me. \n\nI even bought raggae rise up tickets as his Christmas gift because he said he wanted to go. Then when Christmas came he basically said he didn\u2019t want to go and asked if I could return them. I cant bc it\u2019s non refundable. But I bought them knowing he wanted to go.", "Then why can't he just break up?", "The keys is exactly the in between for us. He enjoys fishing and snorkeling. He turned me down. Which I enjoy fishing and I\u2019ve never gone snorkeling before. I\u2019d love to those things. I\u2019d love to go snowboarding and I told him that before he made these plans with his friends. The city I wanted to go to is St Augustine. \nI gifted him raggae rise up tickets for Christmas and he asked if I could return them. The only reason I gifted them to him is bc he said he wanted to go. But bc I can\u2019t refund them he reluctantly said thank you.", ">A nice first step would be asking him what kind of trips he'd enjoy, since apparently he's into snowboarding and camping but not into going to a city or Florida.  \n>  \n>NAH.\n\nSo many people ignored this part.  He clearly likes a certain type of outdoorsy trip.   She seems to just want him to do the trips she wants.  That doesn't make either of them wrong.", "We are boyfriend and girlfriend. He met my kids. I met his family. We took our time due to me having kids. We waited a year.", "Men like this dont tend to be great at introspection or verbal communication. OP can do all this, but shouldn\u2019t expect a satisfactory resolution. In cases like this, you need to let his actions do the talking.", "I\u2019ve offered to pay. But he\u2019s definitely financially well off.", "He definitely knows we\u2019re together. \n\nWe say \u201cI love you\u201d which is a huge deal to us. \n\nHow we made it official isn\u2019t my favorite story. Basically I went out one night with my girlfriends and stayed in that town with them. I didn\u2019t tell him and he has my location. He got super upset. We didn\u2019t talk for 3 days. Once he cooled down we talked. I told him \u201cyou\u2019ve made it clear we\u2019re not in a relationship, and until you want to make it official you can not get mad at me for things like this. And to not expect me to act like I\u2019m in a relationship when you refuse to be in one.\u201d  Once I said that he told he does want to be in a relationship. Now I feel like he only said that so he could have some control.", "Because we get along personality wise. We can go out and about and enjoy our time. We make each other laugh and we agree on a lot of things in life.", "Nta then", "So I'll ask again.  Have you ever sat down and said \"Babe, I'd love to go on a weekend trip with you.  What are some places you'd like\", then try to figure out something that you both are excited about?", "I don't know, she says she has gone on trips with him and his friends so she is willing to go on trips planned for his benefit without insisting that things be catered to her. As long as every trip isn't catered to her, going away for one weekend to a place she really wants to see shouldn't be seen as her being selfish. Should all trips only be things he gets excited about? Are you assuming she only went on the camping trip because it excited her when maybe she went because she knew he liked it and she wanted to spend time with her? Sometimes I go places my husband wants to go when I'm not that keen and he'll do the same for me.", "Me buying the raggae rise up tickets for us was me figuring out something we both like. He said he wanted to go. Once I gifted it to him he changed his mind. But once i told him I can\u2019t refund them he reluctantly said okay and thank you.", "She literally just said he bought tickets to something he said he wanted to go to", "This is me generalizing, i know, but I've seen this in my relationships and some of my friends. \n\nWomen seem to (often) be willing to do things they don't want to hang out with their boyfriends.  They then expect the boyfriends to do things they don't want to in order to hang out with them.  My thing is, if you don't want to come watch football with me and my buddies, don't come.  I don't want people doing things they don't want, and don't expect me to do stuff I don't want.   There are of course exceptions.  I'm not going to skip my girlfriends best friends wedding, but I may skip the Real Housewives watch party.\n\nAnd I'm not saying it should only be things he wants, but I would think they could find something they'd both enjoy.", "Yeah, that is just a dick move if he said he wanted them.", "And she said he would enjoy scuba diving. That wasn't enough apprently. There's a big difference between a weekend away in a nice location and a Real Housewives party. She didn't ask him to watch a romcom and then go dress shopping with her.\nEdit: she said fish and snorkeling, I have scuba diving stuck in my head.", "Sure.  But again, my point is that even if he \"likes\" those things in the abstract, doesn't mean he wanted to do that at that particular time. \n\nI \"like\" skiing, that doesn't mean I'm going to jump at any chance to ski.\n\nAll I'm suggesting is trying to plan the trip together, not her saying \"this is where I want to go\" then being mad he isn't going.", "Well then, she better plan all things to suit him since your point seems to be a man can't do anything a woman might want to do unless they are in the mood even if it's something they like? Are you actually in a successful relationship?", "If they are together, there is likely a compromise to be made that could be discussed. \n\nYou clearly don't think compromise is important, so we probably just won't be on the same page.", "That is my point, a compromise where \"sometimes we do things I like and sometimes we do things you like because we are in a relationship and want each other to be happy\". Your point is clearly \"he didn't feel like doing it so she should try to coax out of this grown man what he would like to do so he can get excited and actually want to spend time with you\". My condolences to your wife / girlfriend."]}
