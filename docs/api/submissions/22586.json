What the hell is wrong with your sister?  It's BAR HOPPING.  You shouldn't even have to announce that it's kid free.", "NTA.\n\nYou don\u2019t take children barhopping. It is unlikely the limo driver would have watched the children because of liability.\n\nYou saved her children from being put in an inappropriate situation.\n\nYou saved your parents from having to rein in their celebration to cater to the children.\n\nYour sister is selfish and clearly doesn\u2019t really care about her mother.

It's silly for them to wait in the limo. Your sister is being childish", "What? Of course you can't take *children* bar-hopping. The limo driver would not have watched the kids and is pretty much guaranteed to have cancelled and refused to take you anywhere else if you'd even tried. And generally speaking bars can usually only allow children inside if they are also a restaurant, still serving food, *and* the kids can't usually be at the bar itself.\n\nNTA. Not everything is for kids, this is one of those things.", "NTA.  The chauffeur is not required to be a babysitter.  Hell, I\u2019m not even sure that would be allowed.  Their job is to get you from point A to point B, etc.  They likely would have flat out refused to be responsible for children while the adults went inside to drink.  \n\nWhile you\u2019d be totally justified to just ignore the off-label whine, I\u2019d contact the limo company and ask what their policy is for leaving minors under the age of 14 behind in the limo while the adults go in and drink. I\u2019m fairly confident they\u2019d say not gonna happen.  Or they\u2019ll say there are additional charges associated with babysitting duties.  There is so much liability involved for the company in agreeing to watch kids.  Sis is being an entitled witch.", "NTA. sis is the AH and purposefully ruined your mom's birthday by making it all about her. You didn't cause stress, sis did.", "NTA- driver of the limo is NOT being paid to babysit two kids while your sister is off getting drunk! Who takes kids on a bar crawl???", "NTA. They could\u2019ve set up a pizza night for the kids with a babysitter.

If she's that careless than the kids are better off staying at home by themselves like wtf.", "NTA, bar hopping IS an adult only activity. The scene you guys were creating for your mom was not a child friendly event. It's not that hard to understand. Your sister is griping about a ride of a few minutes in a limo? This day was not about your sister or her kids. She needs to get over herself. If she's that upset about her precious kids not riding in a limo, guess what? She can rent one for one of their birthdays to take them on a short trip to the movies or a restaurant then back home.", "NTA. Sister is. She is the cause of the heartburn. Dont feel guilty.", "NTA. I was expecting you to say you excluded their newly adult children, but they are actually *children* children. Kids do NOT belong on a bar crawl even if the bars would allow them. To top that off, they are still young enough that they can find it distressing when their trusted adults drink and then behave differently than when sober.", "Kids don\u2019t go bar hopping and as far as I know Limo Drivers are not going to be insured to babysit someone\u2019s children due to liability reasons.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Limo drivers are not babysitters, and it's unfair to expect them to watch your kids while you get progressively drunk through the evening, plus two bored kids unattended in a limo for hours just seems like a recipe for disaster, so her 'compromise' doesn't work.  I think your compromise of the kids riding to the grandparents' house in the limo so they get that experience is very fair.  You could have done some quick birthday cake with the grandkids and then they go home with their sitter while the adults go bar hopping.  Your sister's response was ridiculous.", "NTA.  Your sister is though.  Why would she think it's ok to take her kids bar hopping anyway, not to mention the fact that you said it needed to be adults only.  Your sister is making the day about her instead of finding a sitter or family member to watch her kids.", "And who would stay in the limo with them with the drivers said - I don't think so.\n\nNTA", "NAH", "NTA-they are not old enough to bar hop.  Your sister is in the wrong here.", "Sisters suggestion would only work if she would go to find ice cream bar or some sort (probably evening so not that easy) and skip the bars altogether, which I guess she isn't willing to do. Second is the space, like OP mentioned. If older and not fit people, getting in and out of limo is not easy task, and having kids run around does not make that easier. NTA your offer to let kids ride the pickup was even beyond kind to make everyone happy, but your sister is just arrogant.", "NTA  \n\n\nExplain to your sister that the people who take their children who are not of age \"barhopping\" are not good people, and they obviously do not make good decisions. Make sure there are others there to witness her response.", "NTA - limo driver is not a babysitter! 11 & 13 year olds bar hopping wtf was your sister thinking?", "NTA. Why would she think it\u2019s ok to take her kids bar hopping?!", "NTA.\n\nYour sister is a piece of work. She is making this way harder on her own kids. They will feel like they are missing out only because of her actions. You can\u2019t bring kids bar hopping and you can\u2019t leave kids to be babysat by a limo driver. She is delusional. She had ample time to get childcare. She is acting entitled and ridiculous.", "came here to say this! why would that even be a thing that is considered. Just because it's a limo? NEGATIVE GHOST RIDER - like who would leave their 11 & 13 yo in a car with a limo driver they don't know.", "Which adds another element also bc her kids often stay at home alone when her and her husband go out\u2026.\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Thank you!

Something they would find fun. No matter what she says, they might have found the idea fun, but the reality of being dragged from one bar to the next with increasingly drunk adults would have more likely been a somewhat traumatic experience, and if she can't see that... Well \ud83d\ude2c", "Why are you even inviting your sister?  She sounds pretty entitled.  Cut her out of the event and have some fun.  NTAH.", "And the alternative is to leave them with the limo driver? WTF, she\u2019s going to leave her kids with someone she has known for 15-20 minutes. Yeah, that\u2019s a great idea. /s\n\nNTA OP your sister is a wing nut.", "OP saved the limo driver more then anything, heck what would a limo driver even do with two underage kids stuck in the car? Start charging a baby sitting fee?", "NTA. I would be super petty and send her the link to this.  She was being hateful."]}
