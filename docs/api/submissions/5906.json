I have two nieces (8f) and (5f) so after looking at ideas I decided to do a rocking horse. It wasn't easy and I needed help from my Teacher at points as I didn't want to take any risks with the safety of this but I managed to finish and I even had some of the biggest guys in my class take turns sitting on it to ensure it could hold weight figuring if it could hold them it'd hold kids. \n\nChristmas day came and I gave the rocking horse to my nieces as my sister (30F) and her husband had come round to our parents for the day, my nieces loved it and had to be dragged off it when it was time to eat. My sister not so much and she told me in private she'd have rather I had bought something for the girls as it wasn't that \"nice\" and it'd embarrass the girls if their friends made fun of them for it. Now, it's not exactly stunning, I know one eye is bigger than the other and it's not as good as one you could buy but it's not that bad I thought and I was kinda hurt by this and told her as much but she told me I should have run this by her first so she could have let me down before I wasted my time and that this was a risk of handmade gifts. \n\nI was in a rather down mood for the rest of the day but tried to not let it ruin everyone's fun and her husband loaded it into the car when they were leaving so, fine. She may not like it but the girls had and that's what mattered. \n\nI came back from a day out with my friends today though and found the rocking horse in our Livingroom, apparently my sister had dropped it off while I was gone saying it'd be better if it stayed here so the girls had it to play with when they visited our parents. It has nothing to do with room, the girls have an extra bedroom as their playroom so I know it'd fit in just fine and it's just likely she wanted it out of her sight. \n\nMaybe i'm in the wrong? is it really that bad that it's not as perfect as store bought? Maybe I shouldn't have made something?", "created_utc": 1672282976, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxtss3/aita_for_giving_my_nieces_a_handmade_gift_for/", "score": 174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Handmade rocking horse instead of some lame toy? This gift is awesome.", "NTA- your sister is one though. You put effort into a handmade gift for your nieces, something they will cherish for time to come. Who is going to make fun of a rocking horse?!?! I\u2019m sorry this happened, that was such a thoughtful and nice gift.", "NTA but your sister is one.   The kids loved it.  That's all that matters.     Your sister didn't like it and used her kids as an excuse.  \n\nI would love if a family member hand made something for my kids. The time you invested in making it is worth more than driving to a store for some random item.  \n\nKeep woodworking!   It's a hobby of mine and I love it.", "NTA\n\nYou made a rocking horse? That's amazing. \n\nYour sister is missing an opportunity to teach a life  lesson to her children. If you have a family member who loves you enough to make you a wonderful and unique gift, and your \"friends\" make fun of it, you cut them.", "She was the asshole even before reading the last two paragraphs. That is unreal.  I feel so bad for your nieces.   That sort of entitlement being taught by your sister(you didn't say much about the husband) will not serve those girls well down the road.", "First off, I just wanna say the fact that you are a 17F, and you made a rocking horse!?! You are what I wish I was able to do in high school. \n\nNTA. Your sister on the other hand is a classic AH. \n\nOne of my most cherished belongings is a handmade wooden jewelry box, made by my nephew when he was in high school. I remember when he gifted it to me, he pointed out all the errors in it. But to me, it was priceless. He didn't have to give me anything. He could have made something for his mom, his siblings, but instead he made something for me. \n\nMy heart hurts for you. That your sister ever made you feel bad about this gift not being good enough. My heart hurts for your nieces. That they were cheated out of not only a special gift and moment with their aunt, but a learning opportunity on appreciating this moment in their lives.", "Nta but your sister sure is", "NTA, so much not the asshole. A handmade rocking horse is so much more thoughtful than some gift you just bought at the store or on Amazon. You're sister is a huge asshole. I would totally buy a rocking horse for my 4 year old daughter. She's obsessed with horses right now", "NTA - but your sister is. It seems like she cares more about the appearance of her house than she does about what her kids love and enjoy. Even if it's not pretty, it's the thought that counts. She's just set herself up for a lifetime of you making things for the kids because I don't know about you but I'd be petty and never gift them anything purchased from here on out.", "Omg, NTA, but your sister is.\n\nI am 48.  I have a paper mache skateboarder and first letter of my name my brother made for me when he was in shop.  I have pictures drawn or painted, pottery made for me by friends and nieces and nephews from when I was in HS over 30 years ago up to last week.  I have a painting my friend painted when she was in college and couldn't afford to send me a bday gift.  Blankets made for me through the years some are as old as I am and I love every single one of those gifts.  I don't care how hideous they are.  \n\nMy niece colors on restaurant menus and signs them and gives them to me.  \n\nYour sister is an AH.", "Your sister\u2019s a fucking asshole. NTA", "you did the right thing the gift came from the heart and your nieces loved it and that is all that matters", "NTA at all. \n\nMaking handmade gifts is very thoughtful because it takes more time and effort than just buying something. My wife always makes handmade cards and stuff for my in-laws for this reason. It\u2019s more meaningful. \n\nYou sound like a cool person, and they\u2019re just really ungrateful. You did nothing wrong.", "You made a rocking horse? That's freaking awesome! That would be a great gift to get. Definitely NTA here.", "NTA- the fact that you made it yourself makes it all the more meaningful and special.", "Not, not not not NOT the ahole! \n\nThis was a lovely, thoughtful, wonderful gift. Don\u2019t you dare get rid of it. Even if your nieces won\u2019t one day appreciate it,  your own children will. And I know it\u2019s hard to dismiss such obviously cruel and thoughtless behavior but your sister was only thinking of material things and not with a loving heart.\n\nWell done you for coming up with such a great idea and seeing it through. Keep it up you\u2019ll find plenty of people out there who will appreciate you and your thoughtfulness.", "NTA- your sister is just mad her kids liked it lol. She and the rest of your family probably spent a lot on presents and are mad that the kids are more interested in your very lovingly crafted rocking horse. Please don\u2019t let this deter you from continuing your craft(ing), you\u2019ll see how much people love your work as you grow!", "NTA. Your sister is not a nice person.", "NTA. Your nieces clearly loved it, you put the time and effort into making sure it was built to the best of your abilities and that it was safe, and your sister's excuses about it are obviously made up. You did something thoughtful and it's sad that the kids can't play with it", "NTA. I see my wife struggle with this as well. You worked hard on that rocking horse. Be proud of it. There is nothing wrong with what you did. There are people who dislike a handmade item since they tend to have an imperfection. Your sister is TA here. Good luck on your future projects! Keep creating things for yourself and others!", "NTA - you made a handmade gift with love and hard work, she is being ungrateful and selfish. Also, you\u2019re not even an adult yet so she shouldn\u2019t be expecting you to buy her kids gifts in the first place, so she should be extra appreciative that you went out of your way to make the rocking horse.", "Wait so you put alot of time and effort and made a handmade gift for both of your nieces that they both enjoyed very much. Yet their mother is willing to take away a toy that her own girls treasure and enjoy?? NTA but their mother is messed up.\n\nIt seems like perhaps the mother is jealous that you put something together that both of her children really enjoy and that her gifts seem like they weren't too important. (Seems like she thinks perhaps you were trying to upstage her. So she pulled all the excuses to take away the gift.)\n\nWhether she feels upstaged or not, it's not a competition, your niece's happiness should be the only thing that matters at the end.", "NTA, at all. It sounds like a lovely gift. My brother made my mom a hassock in wood shop years ago (mannnnnny years ago) and she still has it. \nYour sister, otoh, is a tremendous, quivering asshole.", "NTA. It sounds like a lot of work, research, and love went into this project.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine being this ungrateful, your sister is classless and ungracious, and is setting a bad example for her daughters.", "NTA - I still have many of homemade gifts my grandpa and uncles made me from their woodshop when I was a kid and I'd never dream of parting with them. Homemade gifts are the best because they carry so many memories and mean so much more.\nI'm sorry your sister just can't see that.", "NTA - that was such an incredibly kind and awesome gift to give, it's really something that they'll treasure in years to come. Your sister is one though.\n\nKeep up the tech classes and the woodwork, you've obviously got a knack for it \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb", "NTA. Your nieces loved it. That's what counts. Your sister is a jerk for discounting your time and effort.  A rocking horse made out of wood is not cheap.", "I would have loved it if my sibling did that for my kid. Especially since the kids LOVED it. NTA and congratulations for being an awesome aunt.", "NTA this is a beautiful gift. My mom and dad made me a rocking horse when i was a kid. Both of my kids got to enjoy it and now it is stored in our basement in case there are grandchildren to enjoy it one day. \n\nWhat you made was a family heirloom, not an embarrassment at all.", "I don\u2019t know what the freak is wrong with your sister but you are definitely NTA. A handmade rocking horse is a fantastic gift and hopefully your sister doesn\u2019t warp your nieces minds and they can appreciate it as a new family heirloom.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA and your sister is very rude. I make quilts and I choose recipients carefully. Not everyone is quilt worthy and your sister is not handmade worthy. Her loss. Too bad she\u2019s going to teach your nieces to be just as shallow.", "Wow, I would love for my kids do have a rocking horse handmade by their uncle. Your sister sounds like a horse\u2019s ass\u2026", "NTA \n\nYour sister, however, is TA.  How rude and condescending is she?  It seems like her priority is appearances and not the happiness of her own kids. \n\nSorry you had to deal with that after working so hard, and putting so much love into something for your nieces.", "NTA but your sister is apparently a snob.  The kids loved it and the \u201cmistakes\u201d give it personality.  Your sister is a thoughtless biatch especially after you went to time and trouble to make such a special gift.\nDon\u2019t let her discourage you!", "Man a pic would be great here", "I'd love to see this rocking horse if you were to post a pic in a sub here.", "Info.....\n\n\nDoes her husband know what she says to you.... And that she brought it back to your house??\n\nNTA\n\n\nI bet the girls can't wait to play with their horses again. Some of the best gifts I've gotten growing up were homemade.... Still saved for my kids.....", "NTA. You put hours of work into a wonderful handmade gift, and she rejected it because a friend might not love it like they do. She needs to appreciate that the kids love something you made.", "NTA, and your sister is classless. What a kind thing for you to do.", "NTA , you sound like a cool relative to have. That sounds like a really thoughtful gift.", "NTA and, frankly, not a close call. \n\nI came in here expecting this to be something like a \u201ccoupon book\u201d that people make or some other low-effort \u201chandmade\u201d gift.  But this is incredibly nice and thoughtful. Literally months of work and skill, this is\u2014at absolute minimum, even if it were so hideous a contraption as to be practically dangerous to look at\u2014an amazing gesture.  By the way, as a high school student, it\u2019s not like you should be expected to spend any significant sums on gifts for others, so that makes this gift all the more remarkable. \n\nClearly your nieces love it and I\u2019m sad for them, as not only will they not be able to enjoy it, but if their mom keeps this up, it\u2019s going to be a rough next decade or so for them. \n\nSo, all of that is a very long way of saying that, while you are clearly not the AH, this is a heads up that you are really going to need to continue to be very present in your nieces\u2019 lives (I say \u201ccontinue\u201d because, clearly, you\u2019re already a devoted aunt).", "I\u2019m in my late 40s. I have teenage nieces & nephews. \n\nAnd I was out of work during the whole covid thing, so while I usually get Very Cool Auntie Presents, that winter I warned them I\u2019d be hand-making their presents due to lack of cash. \n\nThe most materialistic nephew of the lot (who honestly was the one I expected a bad reaction from) was the first to say: \u201cthat sounds awesome, we\u2019d be happy with home-baked cookies or whatever.\u201d \n\nI made all my presents that year (I didn\u2019t bake though - it\u2019s definitely not my skill!?!). And everyone was just as happy with those as the stuff I usually buy - because they knew I didn\u2019t have the money, but I had spent time on them. \n\nThat\u2019s what it should look like, especially with close family. \n\nYour sister is not being very kind about this. Please focus on your niece\u2019s genuine reaction to the horse you made & ignore the rest.", "NTA -\n\nWhat you made was thoughtful and a lot of work.  Your sister is apparently materialistic and kinda snobby perhaps??  It was very inconsiderate and rude of her to return it to your parents house - it was even ruder still to TELL YOU that you should have purchased something and that what you had done wasn't that \"nice\".  Your sister is NOT \"nice\". SHE is the a/h here, not you.", "NTA, your sister is a big one though. I\u2019m sorry she hurt you. Just know your nieces love your gift.  That\u2019s all that matters.  It will be extra special at the grandparents house.  Hopefully they visit often. They\u2019re probably looking for it.  Hugs.", "I'm a high school teacher, & you are the exact type of student that makes me love my job. You are thoughtful, caring, hardworking, & creative. Don't let your sister's reaction get you down or discourage you. You did something wonderful & you should be really proud of your gift & yourself. Absolutely NTA.", "NTA and while this was not at all the sister's concern- and I'm usually all for handmade- I'd worry about safety. Will it bear weight, is it smooth, is the paint non toxic, are there any places little fingers or limbs could get pinched. I can't see the thing though so all these points may be moot.\n\nThe thought is amazing, please don't get discouraged in making things from the heart.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Such a thoughtful sentiment by a 17 year old.", "Thank you :)", "Then yea you're 100% in the clear and did your due diligence. \n\nNo matter what sister was an ungrateful grinch and handled it very poorly", "NTA. sister is huge AH. Nieces seem very precious. I mean, the only one who'd make fun of them seems like their mom. Its so much cooler to tell other kids and even other older kids that their aunt *made* it for them rather than bought it. Buying things is fine and all, but it doesn't make them feel as special when every other kid has the same toy for ~$14.99.", "NTA\n\nThat was really thoughtful, and if you can focus on the fact that your nieces LOVED it. They'll have it to play with at your grandparents. \n\nYour sister is being the real AH. I would 10/10 want a gift created with that much care and love than something else.", "NTA Your sister is one though and a huge one at that. Hopefully they will spend enough time at your parents house to enjoy it. Your sister on the other hand is a piece of work.", "NTA\nMy kids have a handmade rocking horse. It's big! It's precious! The littlest uses it every day. The eldest is way too old for it and he still sits on it. I'm keeping this thing for my grandchildren.\n\nThat was a really amazingly sweet gift you made. Your sister is completely out of line. Save that wonderful horse for your own kids or give it to a family in need or sell it to someone who appreciates it... \n\nNTA", "I am an adult and if I was gifted that horse, I would love it. Handmade items are wonderful, and if there is any imperfections, so much the better. I believe that when something is handmade (yes, even using some machines), that a small special part of the maker is passed along. I think it is a lovely gift. Your sister is so wrong.", "NTA, and your sis is a materialistic AH. You say the girls have a separate play room? That means they are financially stable and net positive( at least outwardly).", "NTA- many of my gifts as a child we\u2019re hand made by my grandad (woodworker) and they were some of my most treasured items. This included a rocking horse, dolls house, furniture and many more smaller items. Your sister is a major asshole who doesn\u2019t care about her own kids being thrilled with this gift.", "NTA\n\nIt is an amazing gift. Your sister is very foolish, and has no manners.\n\nHope your nieces don't grow up like her.\n\nIn another sub, someone asked encouragement for their dad that was doing them a game related painting after a long hiatus from art. I was so impressed how kind and generous the father was, doing artwork for his child, plus it was a nice picture. \n\nCreative process consumes time and effort, always requires some passion and skill, and produces one of a kind result.\n\nMaybe you can do a project with nieces one day, to convey the joy of handicrafts. I would put some distance to sister. She is totally ill-mannered.", "NTA, such a sweet gift and you should be proud of yourself!", "NTA - your sister is an entitled snob", "NTA \n\nWow your 30 year old sister is pretty mean to her 17 year old that spent 4 months making an awesome rocking chair that her kids loved. \n\nMaybe you outshone her!?", "NTA, my dad made my sister and I a few wooden rocking horses, but my favorite was our rocking dinosaur, named Dino. I\u2019m in my 30s and still talk about those memories, so will your nieces. Proud of you for your hard work!", "NTA. Also, handmade shit costs more because of all the time and effort put into making it. That's why stuff is more expensive at small businesses and websites like Etsy. \n\nBe petty, gussy it up a bit, sell yours for a couple hundred on Etsy and be sure to let your sister know how much money she made you.", "Nta", "Omg. You should be proud of yourself for making that. \n\nDon't let your sisters pathetic attitude drag you down.\n\nIn the future, don't give her anything handmade because she won't appreciate it.", "NTA\n\nYour sister in an ungrateful and selfish person. I\u2019m sorry all the hard work your put into this project has been disparaged by her like this.", "NTA\nGet the sense that sister cares too much about what others think,aside from her own children.Wonder if she only puts value in brands and labels not heartfelt gestures.", "NTA.  How wonderful of you! \n\nYour sister sounds like mine, though.  She once said that she doesn\u2019t want anyone to make presents dor her; she only wants store bought so that she can return them and get the money so she can buy what she really wants.  The next couple of Christmases, my BIL returned everything she got him so he could buy what HE wanted.  For years after that, I asked if she were going to wrap his presents or just leave them in the bags with the receipts.  Karma.", "Your sister is TA and ungrateful af \n\nNTA", "[removed]", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nFor reals tho ... can I have it? \ud83d\ude03\n\nIt is such a sweet and thoughtful gift. You took 4 months to make it and it breaks my heart to think how excited you must have been the entire 4 months.\n\nPlease don't let your sister bring your creativity down! I am sure that if it was anyone else, they would have really appreciated it for their child. It took a lot of time, and I am sure it is beautiful.", "NTA hon, awesome gift", "NTA. I have a 9 year old daughter. I would have cried if she was your niece, and you had given her this, from the pure thoughtfulness and love that prompted the gift. Well done, OP.", "Sounds amazing. Would love to see a pic of it. Obviously NTA but sister is.", "My favourite present of all time was a basket my grandfather wove for me.... It devastated me when it broke", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
