Due to the quick reaction of this sub, I was able to apologise quickly and effectively. I told her I was deeply in the wrong, and now we're good again, and she is sharing her emotions and thoughts with me. I'm being more supportive. I don't fully understand it, and I can't help that, but I don't have to understand it, I just have to behave appropriately. Thanks everyone. I accept the AH verdict.\n\nThrowaway for obvious reasons.\n\nMy wife (F28) is approx. 6 weeks pregnant with our second child. We had our first child 3 years ago with no issues whatsoever after about a month of trying to become pregnant.\n\nThis second pregnancy has also been without issues related to conceiving, as she became pregnant less than two months after we stopped using protection.\n\nToday, she called me (M29) during the day because she is bleeding, and it could be an involuntary abortion. She is very upset, and I told her not to stress about it. If it's a miscarriage, then it's a miscarriage. I told her to call the doctor's office and to rest and take it easy \u2013 maybe it's not even bad news? I know it's perfectly natural to have an involuntary abortion before week 12, and we both know that we generally don't have a problem conceiving. If we were unlucky this time, it's okay, it's not a disaster, we will just try again? My wife didn't like this reaction at all. She was upset by my reaction and hung up on me.\n\nI'm currently studying for the bar exam, which I'm taking later this week, and I'm using most of the week with my study group.\n\nI picked up our daughter from daycare at the end of the workday and came home, and my wife is angry with me for not taking her miscarriage seriously enough.\n\nI told her I'm really sorry, and that I understand that it's not easy to go through. I'm trying to comfort her, but she won't let me be a part of it, because she says I don't care.\n\nI do care, but I'm also stressed out about the bar exam, and I know it's perfectly natural to have a miscarriage. I'm not stressed that we will have any trouble becoming pregnant again.\n\nOf course the situation makes me sad, but I accept reality, and at the same time I'm stressed the fuck out with other obligations. I want to comfort her within reason, and now she won't let me.", "created_utc": 1679330301, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wns43/aita_for_not_taking_my_wifes_possible_abortion/", "score": 845, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if it is \u201cnatural\u201d, it doesn\u2019t make it less painful. Also, I\u2019d argue that you are confusing common with natural.\n\n3. Why is your stressful important life event more important than hers? How would it feel if she said your studying doesn\u2019t matter because you can take it again in July and others have to re-take? I am guessing it would feel pretty awful that your partner is unable to see outside of themselves to support you\u2014maybe you should do the same.

Both are okay, but think about how you\u2019d feel if something happened to your daughter and somebody said \u201cwell you guys won\u2019t have problems making another one.\u201d It would feel pretty callous.\n\nThe secret is not for you to care about the unborn child more or for her to care about it less. Both of you had valid, honest reactions. The secret is to empathize with each other more on this journey.\n\nI hope baby is okay.", "YTA. She had a miscarriage.  That is hard no matter how early it happens.  I'm sure she is sorry she inconvenienced you.\n\nSheesh.", "YTA, your role here is to provide emotional support, not invalidate her feelings. It is normal to have a miscarriage at this point, but it\u2019s not your call to take it easy.

She was scared and needed you\u2026saying that it\u2019s not a huge deal because you can conceive quickly essentially minimizing the pain and mental trauma from the loss.

Death. You could get cancer and die, and it's all natural and part of life. Is it a reason for not feeling sad about it ?!\n\nYTA. Learn some empathy.

But despite that, it probably would have a severe emotional impact, especially from the point of view of the mother. \n\nYou made the classic error of responding to a emotional crisis with a logic, aimed at \"solving\" the crisis. Your wife does not need a solution - she just needs you to acknowledge her feelings, and to trust that she can rely on you through the perceived crisis (which is a difficult thing to feel when you have effectively tried to deny that any crisis exists in the first place). \n\nReiterate that your intentions were good and that trying to manage the crisis was your way of trying to care for her in the way that you knew how...but more importantly, that you now understand how your response was insensitive, and know better know now how she really needs to be cared for, and vow to do better.", "As someone who has had a miscarriage, YTA. My miscarriage was the most devastating, traumatic event in my life so far. Not only are you in physical pain (intense bleeding and cramping) but the emotional pain is horrible. Yes, you know you can get pregnant again (maybe), but you just lost your CHILD. Down the toilet. It's awful. Sorry to be so blunt, but it's the truth.\n\n Not to mention your hormones drop fast, so your body and mind are all over the place. YOUR. WIFE. NEEDS. YOU. My husband dropped everything to help me. He pampered me, brought me flowers, held me as I sobbed. He helped me over the next few months as I fell into depression and anxiety (it didn't help that this was in the middle of COVID). \n\nJust because it is perfectly natural does not mean that it is easy.", "YTA\n\nYou're right, miscarriages happen all the time. However, they can be incredibly stressful and very heartbreaking. \n\n>it's not a disaster, we will just try again?\n\n>I do care\n\nYeah, no you're definitely the AH.

You took it way too lightly.", "YTA\n\nI have no trouble conceiving but that didn't make the two miscarriages I experienced any less painful.  And for one of them it felt like labor pains, the worst thing you want to feel when you are pregnant.", "\u201cwe will just try again\u201d\u2026 YTA for this alone. Ever considered that a miscarriage is so traumatizing for some women they refuse to try again? It\u2019s a loss after someone imagined a future with a baby that will not happen. Pregnancy isn\u2019t a betting game where either you win or lose and \u2018try again\u2019 if you don\u2019t win. It\u2019s called labour for a reason.

Be better", "I think the word you're looking for is miscarriage. \n\nAlso YTA, this isn't the kind of situation which warrants a logical explanation on why she'll probably be able to conceive again. Losing a pregnancy can be painful and traumatic, and she wants to be supported, not told that this isn't a big deal. \n\nI know you meant well, but you could've handled it better.", "YTA. You may be stressed out with other obligations, but your wife needs your support right now. That doesn't mean you have to be overly emotional or anything, but you should be understanding and compassionate. It's perfectly natural to have an involuntary abortion, but that doesn't make it any less difficult for your wife. She needs your understanding and comfort right now, not a logical explanation. It's like when a friend is going through a tough time; you don't need to have the perfect solution, you just need to be a shoulder to lean on.", "YTA - it might be perfectly natural but it's not something you want to experience or something you should be told \"don't stress, if it happens it happens\".

Never being able to try again because your wife has realized you cannot be counted on when things go badly.\n\nPs one miscarriage can easily become multiple. Depending on the CAUSE your 3yo could easily be the only child you two have without medical intervention", "YTA- you seem to lack empathy. You never tell anyone who is going through a miscarriages, it's OK we'll just have another one, when its not your body that has to deal with it all. \n\nYes most marriages DO change after an miscarriage, and you claiming all will be fine is a huge red flag.", "YTA\n\nSeriously!!\n\nThis was a wanted pregnancy and a misscarrage means thats it ended..meaning she's lost something she really wanted and probably already loved.\n\nYou cold and logic way of talking about it, it just callous and not what a supportive husband should he doing. All you kept saying was that it wouldnt be hard to conceive again. Do you not know what a women body goes through in pregnancy an now misscarrage, no. Stop being so callous and be damn supportive.", "YTA, but not for calling it an abortion. The proper medical abbreviation for a miscarriage is SpAb for spontaneous abortion, defined as the natural loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks of gestational age. And I get that the bar exam is important to you, but the baby, your baby, was important to your wife. She's possibly just experienced a loss and is grieving, not to mention the potential for medical complications if she needs to undergo a procedure to remove any tissue left behind. You know, so she doesn\u2019t get an infection and go septic.  \nWhen I had a miscarriage, nobody took it seriously. Work demanded that I come in anyway because it was busy on a Saturday morning and I was a keyholder. Never mind that I was cramping, in pain and bleeding like a murder scene. Wouldn\u2019t let me use my sick pay bank that I\u2019d earned, and FMLA wasn\u2019t a thing for a miscarriage back then. My husband's attitude was whatever, we'll just try again, much like your attitude with your wife. He did nothing for me, no comfort, no concern. He didn\u2019t even come home after work but went out with his buddies that night and had his usual good old time. Our baby DIED, and nobody cared but ME. Yet when one of his sisters had a miscarriage, he visited her and bought her a card and flowers. I got to go home after work and make dinner for our other child.", "YTA in no scenario do you ever brush off a miscarriage as just something normal, it is absolutely traumatizing to the woman. Some women will never try to have children again afterwards, that\u2019s how traumatic it can be. You absolutely acted like somebody that didn\u2019t care. I get you have your own things going on, but the bar exam is not the same as literally losing one of your children.", "YTA.

I myself had one in my early 20s and I wasn't even married to the father, wasn't ready for a baby, etc., so you would have thought all I would feel is relief, but it was still a difficult, sad and upsetting experience.

She is very upset, and I told her not to stress about it. If it's an abortion, then it's an abortion. I told her to call the doctor's office and to rest and take it easy \u2013 maybe it's not even bad news? I know it's perfectly natural to have an involuntary abortion before week 12, and we both know that we generally don't have a problem conceiving. If we were unlucky this time, it's okay, it's not a disaster, we will just try again? My wife didn't like this reaction at all. She was upset by my reaction and hung up on me.\n\nI'm currently studying for the bar exam, which I'm taking later this week, and I'm using most of the week with my study group.\n\nI picked up our daughter from daycare at the end of the workday and came home, and my wife is angry with me for not taking her abortion seriously enough.\n\nI told her I'm really sorry, and that I understand that it's not easy to go through. I'm trying to comfort her, but she won't let me be a part of it, because she says I don't care.\n\nI do care, but I'm also stressed out about the bar exam, and I know it's perfectly natural to have an abortion. I'm not stressed that we will have any trouble becoming pregnant again.\n\nOf course the situation makes me sad, but I accept reality, and at the same time I'm stressed the fuck out with other obligations. I want to comfort her within reason, and now she won't let me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "(Hopefully I can explain well enough to be understood) Imma just put a warning here cause I\u2019m not sure if this might be too much for people that have had miscarriages \n\nOne way to understand would be, imagine one day your told you can be a parent, and the child is inside you, slowly growing. Now you have to watch what you do so that it can grow healthy so you can have your child. You spend every second of every day with this little thing as it grows, this little thing is yours and one day it\u2019ll be you child that you hold on your arms. As the wells go by, you\u2019ll start to get attached, and then, it\u2019s gone. This piece of you that you\u2019ve had with you for week\u2019s to months, this little piece of you that you may have started imagining a future with, a life with, this little piece of you and your partner that was going to be a part of your future, is now give you can\u2019t do anything about it. All that time gone, all those dreams of the future gone, that very thing you were looking forward to more than anything is now nothing you can\u2019t get it back.\n\nFor some people, it\u2019s not much, but for others, that was going to be their baby and it can be really hard on a person to lose that.  \n\nBe there for your wife and make sure they\u2019re doing ok, I know a lot of people need time after a miscarriage.", "I had a miscarriage the day we were moving house(buying and selling, so no flexibility at all - not convenient timing). It was awful, and we had a one year old at the time also. My husband called his sister, who came 100 miles for the day to help him while I went to my mum\u2019s. He was then caring and supportive including when I had to go into hospital overnight the following week. \nAt that stage in a pregnancy, it is fairly common for things to go wrong, but your wife will have formed a bond with the concept of that baby, even though it was still tiny; I had already thought about whether it might be like it\u2019s sister, how they would get on together, what double pushchair I might need to get and so on. Emotionally, it is a death, and she may need to grieve.\nYWBTA if you hadn\u2019t apologised.", "the American bar exam is in February and July, how are you taking it next week?", "It can be difficult to understand how it feels if you will never experience it. I found out I was pregnant, by accident, unplanned and I didn't want another baby. I miscarried about 12 hours after finding out. Even though it wasn't planned and I had only just found out, I cannot explain the raw pain and guilt that I couldn't keep my baby safe. I hope to god I never feel that again.\n\nPlease don't disregard her pain.", "YTA- As someone who has had a similar experience to your wife with regards to how easy it is for me to get pregnant and also having suffered an early miscarriage, it\u2019s not about how easy it is to become pregnant again. It\u2019s about finding out all your hopes and dreams for this tiny person you\u2019ve already bonded with are now gone. That you\u2019ll never get to meet them and see the person they\u2019ll become; never get to hold them. Having a miscarriage is painful in more than one way and it flew way over your head.", "Yes. YTA and I question your abilities as a father. Your child might be dying in the womb and you aren't taking that seriously?", "YTA. Why would you plan to have another baby when you can't handle it during the bar? Are you going to dump everything on her when you're a first year attorney too? Your child died. She isn't a factory", "Info how are you taking the bar in March? Its usually only administered in February or July \ud83e\udd28 \n\nYTA fwiw but I actually wanna know how you\u2019re taking it in March/April lol", "YTA.\n\nI don\u2019t think you understand just what kind of toll a miscarriage has on a woman. She might only be six weeks along, but her hormones are rapidly changing and fluctuations at this point and it will impact her emotions. \n\nThis pregnancy is obviously important to her and now she\u2019s facing the possibility of loosing the pregnancy and instead of being the supportive husband you should be, you just brushed her concerns and emotions under the rug. She has every right to be upset with you.\n\nYou think it\u2019s not a big deal now. But if she loses this pregnancy and becomes pregnant later, her stress and worry are going to be next level. Everything little thing that happens, she\u2019s going to think the worst because she\u2019s going to be terrified that something bad is going to happen again and because you weren\u2019t there for her emotionally this time, she\u2019s probably not going to trust you to be there for her if she were to become pregnant again. Which given your current attitude, I doubt that\u2019ll bother you all that much.\n\nYou also need to understand no two pregnancies are the same. Just because it was easy the first time, doesn\u2019t mean the following pregnancies will go the same way.", "YTA your wife had your baby growing inside her, worried it was going to not survive.

As the pregnancy progresses and the fetus grows, so does that attachment. \n\nOP you\u2019re being insensitive. That was her baby. I guarantee you she had hopes and dreams for it (just as I\u2019m sure you did, but the idea is different than actually being the one growing it.

Sure.", "When I had a miscarriage, my husband thought it was sad but hey, it happens. I felt my baby die. Treat your wife with more compassion.", "Hey, you really seem like you\u2019re trying to adapt and learn how to best support your wife and like you\u2019re willing to hear and admit that you were wrong. That\u2019s a great starting point! I think how you reacted was def an AH moment but it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re an AH generally. \n\nI\u2019m on the spectrum and have always struggled with empathy, having to see it as more as an intellectual and learned thing that something that comes naturally, but hey, that\u2019s okay! I don\u2019t think struggling with empathy makes someone a bad person and I can still show up for the people in my life when they need me, it just looks different. \n\nMy biggest advice would be to let go of your need to logic out how your wife should be feeling or what might be practical in terms of what she might need in the moment and just listen to what she is saying. Ask clarifying questions without judgement, like \u201cI hear that you\u2019re feeling this way, am I understanding correctly?\u201d And \u201chow can I best support you?\u201d People are really good at telling you what they need if you listen and let them and their feelings take the lead in the moment without attaching a need to fix their problems or feelings in a logical way. \n\nI also totally get how juggling a lot of responsibilities can feel overwhelming and where your coming from with how stressed you feel right now but your wife is experiencing something really big right now and you have to leave that aside. Any attempt to bring up your studies when you talk about the miscarriage will only come across to her as her being less important than other things going on in your life. Whether you understand it or not, this is an earth shattering moment for her and because she\u2019s the most important thing in your life now is the time for you to show up for her even if it means other responsibilities don\u2019t receive as much attention as they normally would. She\u2019ll remember forever how you were there to support her and honesty, that\u2019s how you build long term love and trust in a relationship is these moments when she needs you most and you are there for her. \n\nWhen things are feeling better for everyone it might be worth a conversation about your different communication styles so you can make sure that something like this can be avoided between you two in the future. All the best!", "Thanks for this valuable insight.", "Even if you don't believe in fetal personhood and don't feel the need to grieve a miscarriage like a baby, a miscarriage is painful and scary and fucks up your hormones, it's the loss of a potential future where you would have had that baby, and it is absolutely normal and standard for a woman who's having one to need both comfort and emotional support.\n\nI had a 12-week ectopic pregnancy surgically removed when my older son was 1yo. I didn't know I was pregnant and didn't want to be pregnant. I was physically recovered in a day or two. It was STILL a weird and emotional time for me and I still sometimes wonder about that other possible future, where that kid was viable and then I never would have had my younger son.", "and you didn't go home to check on her or your other child... what if she had fainted or the bleeding was something more dangerous than a miscarriage? You're majorly TA", "OP. I see you got the message and fixed things up. But I\u2019d still like to extend a book suggestion to you. \n\nIt\u2019s called: Against Empathy: A Case for Rational Compassion by Paul Bloom\n\nI think what a lot of people are responding to in these comments is your seeming\u2026 distance and lack of empathy. Not everyone has the same level of empathy (which is not a character flaw any more than not having the same skill level with math), this book is a great tool for relationships for peeps with lower empathy levels (which it sounds like you might be).

And even if they're perfectly comforting and nice she might be in too much pain to have many people know). OP seems to have a tough week and a limit to how much he can do until the exam. If there's someone who can help out, support, comfort, maybe tell about their own experiences and share how they overcame them, take the burden of day to day duties so she can either focus on her child, seek some solitude to grieve, spend time with people who she wants around at the moment or even get pampered a bit if that helps her it would be very valuable.", "Really not, English is my third language, so \"sorry\" not sorry for not knowing the word \"miscarriage\".

I don't think you were trying to be cruel or unsupportive but I can see why she felt that way. You were thinking based on logic but she's thinking on emotion.
