I met my husband a year after the breakup and we married a year after that. \nImmediately after the breakup, my ex moved to another state and we went no contract. After I got married, I move to a different state with my husband. About a year later, my parents moved to a completely different state. None of us are living in the original state nor are we living in the same state with each other now.\n\nWhile my ex and I were together, he became very close to my parents. My dad treated him like a son and they used to go fishing together. Our breakup was as hard on them as it was on me. \n\nFast forward to now. We went to my parents for thanksgiving and while preparing dinner, I noticed a beautiful chef knife in her pantry. It seemed out of place sitting with her other knives so I picked it up. It felt different and was sharper than any knife I\u2019ve ever held. It just screamed expensive. I asked my mom where she got it and she was suddenly nervous. After going back and forth without answering, I finally pinned her down and she told me my ex gave it to her as a birthday gift. Confused, I asked more questions and it turns out my ex have been visiting my parents once or twice a year since we broke up and they text about as much. She assured me they never talk about me and it\u2019s like friends visiting. I didn\u2019t notice but my husband was standing in the living room and heard everything.\n\nLater the night, he angrily told me to tell my ex to stop coming around.

We whispered argued until I had enough and told him if it bothers him that much, he can tell my dad to stop seeing my ex but I refuse to contact my ex on such a minor issue.

I\u2019m not saying people should be actively rude to their exes or going to outlandish lengths to avoid them. But your husband wanting your ex out of the family is entirely reasonable.

So why start that drama over a few visits that have no impact on your relationship? If your parents invited your ex around while you were visiting, that would be different, same with if they talked about him all the time or had pictures up of him or whatever. \n\nIs it slightly odd that they keep in touch and visit? Maybe. But talking to your ex about it creates a whole level of drama that no one needs. You are right that if it bothers your husband so much, it should be raised with your parents directly, not with the ex, and he should be able to express why it bothers him to them.", "The sad part about breakups is you're not only breaking up with your partner but you are also breaking up with their family. I'm siding with your husband to an extent.   He is allowed to have feelings about what is going on. He can talk about his feelings and maybe your parents will understand and maybe they won't but then they will know and have a choice. Do they choose your relationship with you and your new husband or do they want to linger with your ex making things awkward for your family? Those are legitimate feelings.  And what about your ex? How is he supposed to move on with a new family and do you think his new partner is gonna be happy with his relationship with your parents? It's really just too much.", "Honestly I'm a bit on the fence here.\n\nI think your parents can see who they want but I do think it's weird that your ex visits them in another state, that's a lot of effort.\n\nHas he met someone else/married!? Which honestly would be even weirder if he has. Who would be truly comfortable with their SO going to visit their ex's family if there aren't children involved.\n\nIs your husband more upset that it was a secret? Also think it's kind of disrespectful of your parents, it's a bit like they're keeping him in their back pocket in case you break up with your husband. Maybe a call every now and then but visits and gifts, that's a bit much imo. \n\nAlso think they know it's weird because they kept it a secret, and they really never mention you, I find that hard to believe, people talk about their kids, they just do.\n\nBut more importantly how would you feel if you found out your husband's family saw his ex in secret? Because I think a lot of people fail to try and imagine how they would feel if it were them in the same situation.", "This\n\nGreat comment.", "NTA.

I understand some breakups are painful and if a partner is abusive or toxic you should cut them out. But if you break up simply because you want different things why can\u2019t they stay in your life?

If they didn't want to talk to him, that is THEIR decision to make, not OP or her husbansds", "This could be so much weirder. My parents are still super close with my ex husband. We had no kids together and the divorce was civil, but not friendly. He and his new wife and their kid visit, have special grandparent names for my parents, bake Xmas cookies, etc. I'm no contact with my parents and have been for years, and they've never met my kids (I remarried also).", "It weird. I would be uncomfortable too.\n\nBut they can't really dictate who the parents can or can't be friends with.", "Yeah, the situation is weird to me.

He\u2019s not just back in his hometown for the holidays and swinging by to \u201csay hi to the Johnsons\u201d.

End of.", "But, if you didn't know about it, why should it make you uncomfortable.  It literally has nothing to do with you.  \n\nLike, I feel it would be fair to say \"Please don't have him around when I'm here\".  But aside from that, its not your place.  Just like it wouldn't be your parents place to decide who you can be friends with."]}
