For some context when I was 4 my mom and dad divorced and a year later my mom remarried dan. Dan had a daughter Julie (24F) and we became really good friends. She\u2019s been my best friend since then and we\u2019ve been inseparable. A few years ago my mom and Dan divorced so me and Julie were no longer \u201cfamily\u201d. I still think of her as my older sister and my grandma invites her to family gatherings. I met Sarah 6 years ago as she was julie\u2019s friend. Sarah is the sun to my life and I don\u2019t know what I could ever do without her. I always smile whenever I think about her and there is nothing I like more than her. When we started dating I introduced her to my extended family and everyone loved her. When Dan and my mom were about to divorce, Sarah fonds out that Julie and I weren\u2019t related by blood. I admit that this was my mistake and that I should have told her that we weren\u2019t related. After Sarah found out she started distancing herself from both me and Julie. I tried talking to her and asking if everything was okay. A month later she tells me that she\u2019s fine and was just surprised by what happened. I continued to press her with questions but after a few months I stopped, thinking that she just needed some space to think about what had happened. 2 years later I proposed to Sarah and she said yes. We had planned everything and when we started talking about wedding guests she told me that I could not invite Julie. I was really confused and asked if she was going to invite Julie face to face or if she wanted to surprise her. Sarah told me that she doesn\u2019t want Julie to be at the wedding at all and that if I want to marry her that we have to cut contact. I was really confused and asked what she meant as Julie was my sister and I couldn\u2019t cut contact for no reason. She didn\u2019t reply and continued to tell me the same thing over and over again. I really love sarah and my family loves her too but Julie is my family even if we\u2019re not blood related. I\u2019m not sure on what I should do as I really can\u2019t imagine a life without sarah but I can\u2019t cut Julie out of my life for a reason I don\u2019t even know. I\u2019ve been asking Sarah to give me a reason as to why I can\u2019t invite her but she hasn\u2019t told me anything.

I would actually put the marriage on hold until she can adequately communicate what her issue is. Julie not being your blood sister isn\u2019t a big deal at all.\n\nMy guess is that Sarah\u2019s is jealous that you and Julie are close, but she accepted it because she thought you were blood siblings. But now she is insecure about your friendship. \n\nYou may be so in love with Sarah that you\u2019ve ignored her character flaws, insecurities, and bad behavior. She has been hurting Julie with her behavior and she either lacks the smarts or the emotional intelligence to give a halfway decent excuse. Sarah doesn\u2019t sound like a good friend and might be a toxic, controlling wife.", "I am a little confused how this is written, but you're NTA. This is a bad sign of things to come if she is giving you an ultimatum that if you marry Sarah you also cut off all contact to Julie. She won't even give you a reason. To me this is a deal breaker. \n\nStrongly consider if this is the type of relationship you want to be in.", "NTA. Dude, your fiance is showing some major toxic/controlling tendencies here. This should be a red flag for you. You're not blood-related to your step-sister. However, that doesn't mean you want to sleep with her, or that your relationship with her should be threatening to your partner. Slow down and really talk this out with your fiance and try to see this situation clearly.", "Sarah is jealous and thinks you may fuck julie at some point. Isn't that obvious?\n\nNTA, it is your wedding too and you should be able to invite the people important to you.", "NTA\n\nJulie may not be a blood relation but she is your step sister.\n\nDon't cut Julie out of your life if you do you will have to tell her why.\n\nSo you need to present the ultimatum back to Sarah. If she loves you wants to marry you then it is with Julie being there and involved in your life.\n\nDo not ditch your sister", "NTA, this would be my hill to die on because, anyone who demands this, will make more and more demands in the future. I would cancel the wedding, nurse my broken heart and then move on.", "NTA. This doesn't pass the smell test. Sarah either knows something about Julie that she isn't disclosing or Sarah and Julie have something between them that Sarah doesn't want coming out. Something more is going on here OP, and you deserve the truth. The wedding should be on HOLD until Sarah is honest with you.", "NTA I would put a stop to *everything* until she can give you a real explanation for why you need to cut out your best friend and sister. Also she was Julie's friend first....did she ditch Julie for not being biologically related to you? That's fucking bizarre dude.", "NTA,\n\nyour wife seems to be insecure of your relationship with Julie. She's probably already assuming negative things about you two, which is a very weird ideology she has going on.", "NTA,\n\nBut unfortunately, your soon to be wife is insecure with how close you are to your sister and she may be thinking that you and Julie have something intimate going on.. I guarantee that's where her thoughts are at", "NTA this is your wedding too not just Sarah\u2019s. If she won\u2019t allow you to invite your sister, call it off & don\u2019t marry her!!", ">AITA for wanting to invite my sister to our wedding?\n\nNTA\n\nThis is worrying. Sarah isn't even giving you a reason to cut contact. It seems like it's some really weird jealousy thing. Red flag...", "NTA Sarah is literaly trying to distance you from your family for no reason thats a tactic abusers use in relationships.  \n\n\nI would postpone that engagement until you get answers and if Sarah wont give you them ask Julie if she knows.  \n\n\nConfront it head on. Seems like Sarah might be the jealous possesive type, which is a major red flag especially if she wont be honest about it and try to deal with it and will instead try to manipulate and control you and make you cut your family out of your life. This is a hill to fight and die on, do not get married until this is very firmly resolved.", "NTA \n\nOP Julie is your family, doesn\u2019t have to be by bloody but she is your family. If Sarah can\u2019t accept that then unfortunately maybe she isn\u2019t the one for you.", "NTA - something is up here, because this is weird.", "NTA.  Sarah is waving a HUGE red flag in your face.  This isn't right, and it won't end here.", "NTA - but put the brakes on marrying Sarah.\n\nOK, Sarah makes you smile and light up. Everyone loves her. You love her... except the part where she\n\n1. DEMANDS to exclude someone you love and who is your family from your wedding.\n2. DEMANDS that you cut off all contact with that person\n3. Will not explain her reasons to you. (Even if it were a case of something horrific between them - like an assault - she would still need to tell you something. The best quick guess I have is - she doesn't like you being that close to someone who is not your blood relative. That's a HER problem. Not all families are connected by blood.)\n\nSarah thinks it's perfectly reasonable for her to make such heart-breaking demands on your personal autonomy and family relationships. She probably won't give you a reason because she knows you won't agree with her thinking, so she denies you the opportunity to challenge her thinking by just not saying what it is.\n\nYou can tell her that you are putting the breaks on getting married and want the two of you to go to couples counseling. If she doesn't agree to that, then go by yourself until you can see her in full and determine what you really need and want to do for yourself. If she does agree, then you two will either work through things and find common ground, or you will realize that the gulf between you two is too far to bridge and be ready to make new decisions for yourself.\n\nJulie is not some dysfunctional bum in your family that Sarah wants you to stop letting drag you down. She's not hostile or cruel to Sarah. Julie is your family that you love dearly. I cannot imagine choosing to be with a person who would ever dream of forcing me to cut off such a dear family member.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t marry someone throwing out ultimatums you cut out members of your family. Especially as they\u2019ve done nothing wrong. \n\nAgree with the above. She\u2019s jealous. And that\u2019s another red flag. \n\nStart as you mean to go on. Is this how you envisaged your marriage? Being forced to only be in contact with your fianc\u00e9es approved list?", "NTA.  You and Julie were raised together as siblings and Sarah doesn't seem to get that someone can be your sibling but not be related to you by blood.  I wonder if she'd have the same issue if your mom adopted Julie.\n\nSarah has given you an ultimatum, her or Julie.  You shouldn't be forced to choose between your wife and your sister without a damn good reason, and Sarah doesn't have one.", "NTA-For wanting her there. She is family full stop. Why though are you marrying someone who doesn\u2019t respect you or the life you share enough to give you an actual reason why she doesn\u2019t want her there or giving you an ultimatum about your sister\u2019s place in your life?\n\nYes, you love her and your family loves her but if that love was reciprocated in a healthy way she\u2019d never try to control you by forcing you to cut off family.", "NTA- I would tell Sarah that blood or not Julie is my sister and I am not going to cut her out of my life.  So she (Sarah)either needs to deal with that, explain why she is so adamant about cutting Julie off or the wedding and relationship are over.", "NTA, Julie is your sister. \n\nBut you've let this go on for years without addressing it which is so weird! In two years, did you not see your sister?\n\nDo you stick your head in the sand on other things too? Do you know how to have healthy conflict?\n\nThis might be a couples counseling situation. There's something seriously wrong with how you both shut down and didn't talk about this for years. And it won't be the last thing. There's a million things that you face in life where you have a different perspective than your partner.", "NTA.\n\nI know this is basically a cliche here, but call off the wedding. Seriously, Sarah is not mature enough for it. \n\nThere are two possible reasons Sarah hasn't told you why she doesn't want Julie there:\n\n1. She doesn't trust you (this isn't very likely but should be a dealbreaker)\n2. She doesn't have an actual reason but is jealous and controlling (also a dealbreaker)\n\nYou obviously can move forward however you see fit, and if you want to give Sarah another opportunity to be honest with you that's fine, but as things stand you should definitely not get married to someone this immature.", "Don't marry her. Shes already controlling you. \n\nNTA", "In the immortal words of Clueless \"You divorce wives, not children\". Or in your case, siblings. Julie is functionally your sister. Unless your post is missing a lot of information (like Julie bullied Sarah or that you and Julie were romantically involved), Sarah asking you to cut out a family member is beyond concerning and should make you rethink marrying here. NTA.", "NTA. This is odd", "Theres obviously an unresolved issue Sarah has with  Julie, which she needs to explain.", "NTS, but Sarah is", "NTA \n\nBut you will be if you won't at a minimum reconsider this marriage. \n\nBecause if your fiancee sees your sister as a threat, how do you think she'll treat your female coworkers? Or friends? Or, if you have kids, the other moms? \n\nIt will end badly.", "NTA. \n\nWhen do you plan to tell Sarah that the marriage is cancelled because you had forgotten your appointment with the dentist on that day and that you probably won't be available for the next 60 years or so?", "NTA! Major red flag regarding your fiance. \n\nShe is jealous of your sister now that she knows the two of you aren't blood related. In her mind, there's a chance you'll have an affair with her because of how close you two are. \n\nFor her to tell you cut ties or else is a huge red flag. She's literally demanding you to choose between her and your family. Not okay. \n\nAre you okay with that? \n\nIf not, I'd seriously consider not going through with the marriage because this is just a glimpse of what it will be like after you're locked in and she feels freer to be controlling and find other ways to isolate you because of her insecurities and need for control. \n\nGet out now, I say.", "NTA! Major Red Flags popping up though! You would have to cut ties?? But then Julie still comes to family events, so does that mean you can't go?", "DIE ON THAT HILL. NTA", "NTA. Run bro, before you end up divorced and paying her life off when she decides you looked at another woman for 7 seconds and fell in love", "Has Julie ever expressed that there was bad blood between her and Sarah?", "NTA. Either Sarah has some SERIOUS trust issues, or there is something big that you are keeping out of the story. I'm choosing to believe the former.", "NTA. So your fiance wants you to cut your step sister (and she is that) and best friend of 20 + years out of your life, without giving a reason? She then holds you to ransom with your marriage. If I am reading this right because you and Julie are no longer related by blood or marriage, Sarah is jealous and threatened by your closeness. This is power play. Sarah wants you to pick her over Julie, when the reality is there doesn't have to be a choice. Take this as the HUGE red flag it is.", "NTA, either there's a reason why Sarah doesn't want her there or she's a controlling asshole. \n\nif I were you, I'd put the wedding on pause until she starts communicating with you", "Are we 100% that Sarah doesn't know something about Julie that would have been OK if you were related, but wouldn't if you aren't? Not sure what that could be, but naked pictures of you or something? I sincerely doubt it, and it sounds like a cut and dried case of Sarah being nutso, but it might be worth looking into further. Also have you asked Julie why she thinks Sarah cut contact with her?", "NTA - This is a giant red flag yo, and it's waving like it's in a hurricane.", "NTA.  Ask Julie if she knows why Sarah is saying this but don't go ahead until you know why and address it.  If Sarah can't explain this then you need to work on your communication before getting married.", "NTA. Why are you marrying someone like this???", "NTA.\n\nSarah doesn't want you having a relationship with Julie because she's afraid you'll run off with Julie now that's she's discovered you aren't blood related.  I'd put the wedding on hold until Sarah gives the reason and you can discuss it.\n\nYou can't imagine a life without Sarah??  Sure you can; you had a life before you ever met her.  Don't let love blind you.", "What did your fiancee say to your sister that made her walk away?\n\nThey were friends and now your fiancee insists on no contact. Why?\n\nVisit your sister to find out why. NTA", "Ask Julie if anything happened between them. She may know.", "That would be a dealbreaker for me. Would she feel the same if you were adopted? What if you can\u2019t have kid? Will she not consider adopted kids \u201creal family\u201d? This is a big red flag. \n\nIs it just your sister or has she tried to isolate you from any friends? \n\nI can tell you this. If you cut out Julie then prepare for some backlash. If my son and DIL did something like that, then DIL would no longer be welcome in my home.\n\nYTA if you marry this woman.", "Nta are you sure you want to marry such a jealous child that cannot communicate properly", "NTA i dont know why you're feince would act like that maby she thought about a different relationship with you're sis but you should respect her wishes and not invite her but that doesnt mean you cant send her videos and photos so NTA", "YTA, but only because you haven't called off the wedding already for this person demanding that you literally cut your sister out of your life without even having a mature conversation about it.

The only thing that seems to make sense is that Sarah is jealous and insecure in your relationship with Julie! She has no other reason to act the way she has after finding out that you\u2019re not blood related. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to be related by blood to be consider family!! I would absolutely not plan a wedding until Sarah comes clean about all this! And if you cut Julie out of you life for no reason, then you\u2019re an asshole.", "NTA.  I can\u2019t imagine any reasonable scenario where OP should continue with this wedding.  It would have to be something next level craziness like if Julie had stomped Sarah\u2019s baby kittens to death wearing four inch stilettos and left Sarah to clean up the mess while she made her getaway on a broom out the window while her screeching laughter echoed into the dark night sky.", "NTA, but I think this marriage is doomed before it even started.  She is not telling you why you cant invite her but that you cant and that you not suppose to even be in contact with her. That sounds alitte suspicious", "NTA\n\nThink long and hard about this. Sara may be the light of your life but does she provide enough light to cover the love and light Julie and others in your family give? Because make no mistake, by cutting off Julie you will incur the wrath of your grandmother and likely your mother, even if she is no longer married to Dan.\n\nAnd rightfully so. Blood means dramatically less than a solid bond. It\u2019s just that blood often means you have more exposure to those people and if they are good people you will likely have a good bond.", "NTA\n\nend your engagement, this woman is not the sun to your life, she is an eclipse that will darken your existence. She is being cruel and controlling and it will only get worse.", "Something is missing here\u2026\n\nNTA because family doesn\u2019t have to be blood related, but there\u2019s more to this story. Hopefully Sarah can spill the tea as to why she\u2019s so jealous and controlling about your sister.", "What? I would advice you to Reconsider the whole marrying this person. Your gf seems extremely insecure and jealous of your step-sister. That\u2019s not healthy and her whole attitude is controlling.", "NTA - She will continue to dictate who you can be friends wand it\u2019s going to be a very small group.  Most will be her friends.", "NTA\n\nAs other posters have noted Sarah is waving a huge red flag the size of Rhode Island with her version of relationship blackmail. \n\nToday she is telling you that you must choose your sister or her.  Best guess is she feels inferior to your sister and somewhere in her twisted brain because you aren\u2019t related by blood expects you one day to wake up in love with sister and dump her?  \n\nWhatever the issue is the type of crazy that Sarah is exhibiting just gets worse. \n\nIn the future there will be more of this me or them.  Could be about other family, friends, career, housing, whatever. \n\nAnd if you have children it will escalate to me and the children or whoever/whatever. \n\nYou must do what you think is best for you OP and I wish you the best in figuring it out.", "Dude get out of that relationship asap! If that\u2019s how she\u2019s gonna start your married life no doubt she\u2019s gonna make you cut out others too. You can find another woman NTA", "This is it exactly, I would bet Sarah has always been jealous of Julie, maybe feeling like the \u2018ugly \u2018 friend. For what?!!? fear he\u2019ll cheat with the girl that's been his sister since he was 5! \n\nAnd yeah, she simply asking him to go no contact with someone he considered a sister without an explanation is ludicrous. \n\nThe grandmother is definitely going to want to know they stop showing up for events as long as Julie there. \n\nI would have to pause this engagement if for no other reason, than I'd want to know who else she wants out my life, co-workers, 2nd cousins, family by marriage?", ">Sarah is jealous that you and Julie are close, but she accepted it because she thought you were blood siblings\n\nmy thoughts exactly. wouldn't be surprised if Sarah is the kind of girl that believes it's impossible for guys and girls to be friends without romantic/sexual feelings involved. sad sign of an insecure, narrow-minded person.", "This is how I'm thinking also.  She can't tell you a reason, anyone who wants you to cut people out of your life should actually be the one not in your life.  Especially for no reason.  \n\nNTA\n\nWatch out for the red flags here OP.", "Exactly! You need to hit the pause button until Sarah can communicate. Marriage is not about 1 person making unilateral decisions it's about compromise.", "I agree this is a bit of a confusing post. If I\u2019m reading this right, Julie and Sarah were friends first before OP met Sarah. So wouldn\u2019t Sarah have known about them being stepsiblings from Julie? Why is she being punished? And OP, you need to get answers before the wedding because this tension will continue into holidays and all family gatherings. NTA", "Or what happened between fianc\u00e9 Sarah and Julie?  Like did Julie admit to being in love with OP, or did they fight? \n\nLike they were friends-  what happened. OP is NTA but it is hard to judge Sarah without the full picture.  The fact that she won\u2019t talk about it is concerning.", "I agree with this\u2026. it could be Sarah is jealous or could be that Julie did something nasty to Sarah, but she needs to talk about it with you if you\u2019re gonna get married.\n\n\u201c if we\u2019re gonna get married, we need to be able to share things with each other\u2026 I have to know what the issue with Julie is\u201d", "Honestly, \n\nThis Op doesn't understand how huge this situation is. In time I believe, he will see it", "It definitely reads like Sarah is jealous that her Fianc\u00e9 is close to someone he doesn't share DNA with.\n\nIf I was OP I would hold off with the wedding until Sarah explains herself. And if/when she does admit its jealousy that OP is close to his non-biological sister, I would hold off until she gets therapy and Julie gets an invite.", "Only thing I can think of is that Julie and Sarah become friends more recently and Julie introduces OP to Sarah as her brother. If I had a new friend that I had met in college or through work or something, I might not know the intricacies of their family in the same way I would of a friend I had growing up going to their house as a kid."]}
