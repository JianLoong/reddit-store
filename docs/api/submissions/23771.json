My sister (F18) is about to go to college and is finishing up her senior year. Unfortunately, my parents suddenly were not able to pay for my sister's tuition and she is devastated. My sister is living with me now so that my parents can sort out their financial situation. She had gotten into an Ivy League school and now that she couldn't go, she has locked herself in her room in my apartment and hasn't come out except to go to the bathroom or grab DoorDash from the front door. Finally, she came out a week ago and has been trying to move on.\n\nSince living with me, she has learned that my business is pretty successful and I am on the wealthier side. Plus, I lived alone before she came to my apartment so I was not spending a lot of money to support myself either. 2 weeks ago, she came up to me and asked for me to pay for her college tuition. We had a discussion about how it would work and what the price was for her to attend. When we worked out the details (which was over multiple days of deliberation and consideration), it turns out I am able to pay for her college tuition and other fees. In our theoretical plan, it was decided that during the summer of her 3rd year, she would need to secure a job above minimum wage to help pay as well.\n\nI told her that the amount I would be paying would hinder my life and my business and she would need to cut down on some of the unnecessary things like having a dorm room to herself without roommates in order for it to work. Granted, the amount I would be paying would still allow for my business to stay intact and for me to live in appropriate conditions. She told me that those \"unnecessary things\" were actually very important for her to attend college properly and that she could not cut down. Some of the things we wanted was a room without a roommate, access to a library that has a hefty membership fee, decorative and overpriced furniture, and a new desktop computer with the computer, the display, the keyboard, and the mouse with an ergonomic mousepad included.\n\nI've decided not to pay for her college tuition unless she can compromise. She won't talk to me and chooses to ignore the fact that I exist. She has thrown two tantrums in the past week about how I'm being selfish when our plan clearly shows that I am capable of paying and this is not an opportunity to pass up. She has now contacted our older brother (M30) and he has been calling and texting me non-stop to let her go because it was a really good school and one of ones that was very high on my sister's list of applications.

And I guarantee you that if she isn\u2019t compromising now, she wouldn\u2019t get a job in the future to help pay as well.\n\nA couple things, assuming this is a real post. 1) Your sister can try for a gap year while your parents sort out their financial situation, and then she can start next year. It might be too late, but worth asking. 2) Ivy Leagues are really good about working individually with students to form personalized loan plans. If she really wants to attend, she can take on a loan and the associated risks.", "NTA, she can get herself started at community college. Just because you make enough to pay her way does not mean you're obligated to. She's an adult and getting a dose of the real world would do her some good.", "NTA - girl what?!

She won\u2019t follow any terms you agree to anyway.", "NTA\n\nWhat you're doing is VERY generous! She needs to compromise.

It wouldn\u2019t hurt her to get a job and live in the real world. A few other options: she can get her own student loans, go to a less expensive school, she could defer a year to work and learn to be less demanding and more grateful, you could send her back to her parents and let them deal with her. What happens if you spend all of this money putting her through school and then you need it? Is she going to work hard to take care of you?", "You're not her parent. You are being very generous, trying to step in and fill the financial gap left by your parents. If she can't appreciate that and manage her expectations (and stop throwing tantrums into the mix), then she's not deserving of your help. Maybe if you don't help her, she'll finally grow up and be less entitled. At 25, I'm sure there are lots of things you'd rather do with your money. Plus you need to still put money aside for your business. If your sister is not willing to meet you halfway then send her back to your parents, she's their kid after all, not yours.

She doesn\u2019t get to have some Instagram worthy dorm experience- welcome to life. She\u2019s smart enough to get into Harvard, she\u2019s smart enough to figure it out. Do not give in to her princess behavior. \n\nTell your brother that if he doesn\u2019t knock it off you will block him. That you worked damn hard for your company to be this successful and you do not owe it to your sister to pay for her education. And that she needs to look at the reality and work within your means- not expect you to fully support her fantasy experience- and her temper tantrums and sense of entitlement are not going to fly with you. \n\nAlso- has she exhausted her financial aid options? Has she thought about deferring for a year so that you and your parents can be in a better place? Additionally- depending on when they took the financial hit, she might qualify for more grants and loans. \n\nThis school will cost $56k per year. As heartbreaking as it is, she needs to get real.", "NTA- she can get financial aide, take out loans, etc if she really wants to go. You\u2019re not her bankroll and don\u2019t owe her anything. Giving anything would be generous. \n\nThe only thing I could think of that argues in her favor would be of your parents paid your school, and are now unable to pay hers.

Personally, I\u2019d have her go to a less expensive school or figure out financial help some other way. Throwing temper tantrums is ridiculous because she\u2019s not getting what she wants.

If big brother isn't kicking in to fill in the financial gaps, he needs to stay in his lane.", "NTA. You sister can\u2019t accuse you of compromise when she\u2019s staying firm on non-essentials. Quite honestly, waiting until her third year summer to get a job is unbelievably reasonable. Your brother needs to stay out of it unless he is prepared to fins a portion of her education. Your financial priority needs to be you and ensuring you have enough capital to sustain your business", "So she is demanding things that you literally can\u2019t afford!

Drive the ungrateful, apparently too smart for her own good sister to a bank and tell her to get a loan since she  *cannot* compromise and *must* use your money because she\u2019s entitled to it for, you know, decorations and her very expensive library fee. If she needs a co-signer, get your AH brother to do it.", "You are being more than generous with your offer.   Your sister needs to stop acting so entitled considering that she is asking you to pay for her.  She is being a choosing beggar. \n\nTell brother to put up the cash or stay out of it", "NTA \n\nTell your brother he can pay half of the tuition and keep his cakehole closed", "NTA. She can\u2019t demand just because she\u2019s your sister and you\u2019re making money. That being said, she\u2019s your little sister and you definitely love her.
