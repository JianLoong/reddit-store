She had gotten into an Ivy League school and now that she couldn't go, she has locked herself in her room in my apartment and hasn't come out except to go to the bathroom or grab DoorDash from the front door. Finally, she came out a week ago and has been trying to move on.\n\nSince living with me, she has learned that my business is pretty successful and I am on the wealthier side. Plus, I lived alone before she came to my apartment so I was not spending a lot of money to support myself either. 2 weeks ago, she came up to me and asked for me to pay for her college tuition. We had a discussion about how it would work and what the price was for her to attend. When we worked out the details (which was over multiple days of deliberation and consideration), it turns out I am able to pay for her college tuition and other fees. In our theoretical plan, it was decided that during the summer of her 3rd year, she would need to secure a job above minimum wage to help pay as well.\n\nI told her that the amount I would be paying would hinder my life and my business and she would need to cut down on some of the unnecessary things like having a dorm room to herself without roommates in order for it to work. Granted, the amount I would be paying would still allow for my business to stay intact and for me to live in appropriate conditions. She told me that those \"unnecessary things\" were actually very important for her to attend college properly and that she could not cut down. Some of the things we wanted was a room without a roommate, access to a library that has a hefty membership fee, decorative and overpriced furniture, and a new desktop computer with the computer, the display, the keyboard, and the mouse with an ergonomic mousepad included.\n\nI've decided not to pay for her college tuition unless she can compromise. She won't talk to me and chooses to ignore the fact that I exist. She has thrown two tantrums in the past week about how I'm being selfish when our plan clearly shows that I am capable of paying and this is not an opportunity to pass up. She has now contacted our older brother (M30) and he has been calling and texting me non-stop to let her go because it was a really good school and one of ones that was very high on my sister's list of applications.

You should have managed expectations consistently along the way. 'ah yes, dormrooms, well I am not paying for a singles, but a double will cost X'. Later on 'im not paying for a pc worth 5k, what are the course requirements, let's find one that matches that, etc...'\n\nThat's like someone selling you your dream home listing every furnishing, detailing it all out, telling you the price, you going oh yes, this is it!

Oh hell no.  I've seen the saying on Reddit before:  \"Don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm\".  An Ivy league school, while nice, is not the end all and be all.  AND it's selfish and entitled for her to expect you to pay for her tuition - she's not your child or your responsibility. AND it's completely over the top (and shows her true character) that she's unwilling to compromise when you came up with a plan to pay for her tuition.  I wouldn't pay for her college.  Her reaction to your negotiation shows that she's completely self-centered and has no clue of the sacrifice you'd have to made to fund her overpriced demands.", "Fake ... if your financial situation has changed that much, you can just contact the financial aid office.

You are NTA.", "Flash back to my first quarter (my college was still on the quarter system... it was weird). I found out my parents couldn't afford ANYTHING after that.

The attitude. \n\nThe sister has no respect or appreciation for the sacrifice that OP had already offered. OP is NTA.", "YTA This was poorly written. Yale and Princeton have been leaders in giving free rides to anyone who can demonstrate need. All the Ivies have followed with hugely generous scholarship programs.

They really do give you a leg up when it comes to finding a job.\n\nWhy hasn't it crossed her mind that she can get a student loan? I don't understand why she thinks it's all or nothing when it comes to having her school paid for. After this tantrum, I'd pull support for room and board and just go with covering tuition.

Being young in today's world really sucks.\n\nI got a hard reality check in 2017 when I realized that I had to pay my own way for college. My parent's annual income was too high for me to qualify for any financial assistance, but they were not contributing to my education at all. I only had a few thousand saved up from my highschool part-time job. I chose to go to college instead of university which was a bitter pill to swallow. I still had to take out a small loan, but it was manageable and I got it paid off during college because I worked at the same time. I chose college because I had to be immediately employable though if I wanted to survive without a crippling amount of debt. In the end, it was the right move for me personally.\n\nYour sister is likely grieving for the life she thought she might've had. It was kind of you to offer to help. If she isn't able to appreciate that now, she can either get a loan or take a year off to work and save up while she's living with you and not paying rent.\n\nYou're probably going through the worst of it right now. It will get better. Just be there for your sister (as you have been) and she will figure it out one way or another.

Her behavior and entitlement are sickening.", "Your brother is very welcome to pay for her tuition or to share expenses with you. Nobody's entitled to other people's money, and if someone offers to pay your tuition on condition that you compromise and retrench, the least you could do is to retrench, compromise AND BE GRATEFUL.

However- they NEVER offer to do what they expect someone else to do! If he\u2019s so upset and thinks you need to pay for her tuition, than he shouldn\u2019t have any trouble splitting the cost.

Your NOT THE ASS!", "NTA; your sister is behaving like an entitled, ungrateful and spoiled brat.  If her parents experienced financial hardship, and she is essentially now on her own, she can talk to the school, defer her enrollment to the Spring/summer session.

What an ungrateful brat! I\u2019d cancel my offer and tell her she can go to a state school and take out loans. I\u2019d also suggest she go live with someone else, like your brother.
