My sister (F18) is about to go to college and is finishing up her senior year. Unfortunately, my parents suddenly were not able to pay for my sister's tuition and she is devastated. My sister is living with me now so that my parents can sort out their financial situation. She had gotten into an Ivy League school and now that she couldn't go, she has locked herself in her room in my apartment and hasn't come out except to go to the bathroom or grab DoorDash from the front door. Finally, she came out a week ago and has been trying to move on.\n\nSince living with me, she has learned that my business is pretty successful and I am on the wealthier side. Plus, I lived alone before she came to my apartment so I was not spending a lot of money to support myself either. 2 weeks ago, she came up to me and asked for me to pay for her college tuition. We had a discussion about how it would work and what the price was for her to attend. When we worked out the details (which was over multiple days of deliberation and consideration), it turns out I am able to pay for her college tuition and other fees. In our theoretical plan, it was decided that during the summer of her 3rd year, she would need to secure a job above minimum wage to help pay as well.\n\nI told her that the amount I would be paying would hinder my life and my business and she would need to cut down on some of the unnecessary things like having a dorm room to herself without roommates in order for it to work. Granted, the amount I would be paying would still allow for my business to stay intact and for me to live in appropriate conditions. She told me that those \"unnecessary things\" were actually very important for her to attend college properly and that she could not cut down. Some of the things we wanted was a room without a roommate, access to a library that has a hefty membership fee, decorative and overpriced furniture, and a new desktop computer with the computer, the display, the keyboard, and the mouse with an ergonomic mousepad included.\n\nI've decided not to pay for her college tuition unless she can compromise. She won't talk to me and chooses to ignore the fact that I exist. She has thrown two tantrums in the past week about how I'm being selfish when our plan clearly shows that I am capable of paying and this is not an opportunity to pass up. She has now contacted our older brother (M30) and he has been calling and texting me non-stop to let her go because it was a really good school and one of ones that was very high on my sister's list of applications.

Then everyone's happy, right?\n\nSeriously, tho, your offer was generous and she should have been crying with gratitude, not bitching over new furniture. That's insane.", "NTA. And I guarantee you that if she isn\u2019t compromising now, she wouldn\u2019t get a job in the future to help pay as well.\n\nA couple things, assuming this is a real post. 1) Your sister can try for a gap year while your parents sort out their financial situation, and then she can start next year. It might be too late, but worth asking. 2) Ivy Leagues are really good about working individually with students to form personalized loan plans. If she really wants to attend, she can take on a loan and the associated risks.", "NTA, she can get herself started at community college. Just because you make enough to pay her way does not mean you're obligated to. She's an adult and getting a dose of the real world would do her some good.", "NTA - girl what?! She can take the help or leave it. She\u2019s also old enough to take her attitude elsewhere. She\u2019s ungrateful and entitled. She won\u2019t follow any terms you agree to anyway.", "NTA\n\nWhat you're doing is VERY generous! She needs to compromise. Other kids whose parents fall on hard times have to sacrifice all the time, or kids who simply never had these opportunities *at all*.\n\nIt's MORE than reasonable to require that she compromise. It is not selfish of you in any way shape or form to require these compromises from her.", "NTA. I\u2019ve never heard of a library access fee for students, and having a roommate is a right of passage. Your sister sounds like an entitled brat", "NTA.\n\nMy parents were not able to pay a single penny toward my college tuition due to their financial situation so I worked on applying to as many scholarships as I could. Luckily, I was able to get a full ride to a Big Ten school due my hard work, but I really felt like I was on my own having to deal with the whole process. I would\u2019ve been lucky to have an older sibling like you.", "NTA\n\nHow about you pay for tuition and whatever it is you're willing to pay for, and your brother pays for the library membership, expensive furniture and the difference in rent?", "NTA. You are her sister, not her parent and she is a spoiled brat! If you want to be incredibly generous, you can offer to pay for half of her tuition, your brother can pay for the other half and she can find another way to pay for the extras. It wouldn\u2019t hurt her to get a job and live in the real world. A few other options: she can get her own student loans, go to a less expensive school, she could defer a year to work and learn to be less demanding and more grateful, you could send her back to her parents and let them deal with her. What happens if you spend all of this money putting her through school and then you need it? Is she going to work hard to take care of you?", "You're not her parent. You are being very generous, trying to step in and fill the financial gap left by your parents. If she can't appreciate that and manage her expectations (and stop throwing tantrums into the mix), then she's not deserving of your help. Maybe if you don't help her, she'll finally grow up and be less entitled. At 25, I'm sure there are lots of things you'd rather do with your money. Plus you need to still put money aside for your business. If your sister is not willing to meet you halfway then send her back to your parents, she's their kid after all, not yours. Let them figure it out.\n\nQuestion: Is your brother helping in any way or just criticizing how you choose to help?\n\nStick to your guns, OP. NTA. But your sis is, and your bro too.\n\nEdited.", "NtA she is an entitled brat. You are such a great sister I wondlt flex on this as this will impact your life massively. Of Stewartstown those extras she can work part-time to pay for them.", "NTA- It sucks that reality is hitting her hard, but that\u2019s not your fault. She doesn\u2019t get to have some Instagram worthy dorm experience- welcome to life. She\u2019s smart enough to get into Harvard, she\u2019s smart enough to figure it out. Do not give in to her princess behavior. \n\nTell your brother that if he doesn\u2019t knock it off you will block him. That you worked damn hard for your company to be this successful and you do not owe it to your sister to pay for her education. And that she needs to look at the reality and work within your means- not expect you to fully support her fantasy experience- and her temper tantrums and sense of entitlement are not going to fly with you. \n\nAlso- has she exhausted her financial aid options? Has she thought about deferring for a year so that you and your parents can be in a better place? Additionally- depending on when they took the financial hit, she might qualify for more grants and loans. \n\nThis school will cost $56k per year. As heartbreaking as it is, she needs to get real.", "NTA- she can get financial aide, take out loans, etc if she really wants to go. You\u2019re not her bankroll and don\u2019t owe her anything. Giving anything would be generous. \n\nThe only thing I could think of that argues in her favor would be of your parents paid your school, and are now unable to pay hers. That\u2019s not your fault and not hers, but a compromise could be to pay back some of what you got from your parents. \n\nTough to say without knowing more, but definitely NTA - your sister sounds entitled and doesn\u2019t appreciate how hard you\u2019ve worked to grow your business, and doesn\u2019t seem to care that funding her college could negatively impact your business", "This is not your job to pay, if she can\u2019t accept she has to cut down to get your help, it\u2019s apparently not that important to her. NTA", "NTA\nIf she doesn't want to compromise with the person whose giving her money than she shouldn't go to college.", "INFO how did a financial issue end with your parents not being able to live with her?\n\nWhy do you need her to \"agree\" on the furniture? It will be you spending the money not her.", "NTA she sounds super spoiled. This is real life and you don\u2019t have to pay for her schooling at all. Make her get a job to pay for any extras and the things she will needs that exclude school supplies. Your brothers opinion doesn\u2019t matter unless he\u2019s like to help pay. Personally, I\u2019d have her go to a less expensive school or figure out financial help some other way. Throwing temper tantrums is ridiculous because she\u2019s not getting what she wants. I think it\u2019s sweet you took her in, but maybe she could even qualify for financial aid if ur parents are struggling so badly she can\u2019t live with them.", "NTA at all. \n\nYou\u2019ve only got to have a downturn in your business and paying her tuition suddenly becomes a problem. You\u2019ve offered a very generous solution if she\u2019s not willing to compromise then maybe your brother can foot the bill and get off your back.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't have to pay for her college at all. Your offer is incredibly generous. The fact your sister doesn't see that says more about her than you.\n\nIf she's not willing to compromise and work with you, she can figure it out for herself.  If big brother isn't kicking in to fill in the financial gaps, he needs to stay in his lane.", "NTA. You sister can\u2019t accuse you of compromise when she\u2019s staying firm on non-essentials. Quite honestly, waiting until her third year summer to get a job is unbelievably reasonable. Your brother needs to stay out of it unless he is prepared to fins a portion of her education. Your financial priority needs to be you and ensuring you have enough capital to sustain your business", "So she is demanding things that you literally can\u2019t afford! And you can\u2019t take too much out of company without risking the goose with golden eggs. She needs a reality check. NTA", "NTA. She is not entitled to your money. Even if you were her parent, she still would not be entitled to your money.\n\nYou offered compromise. She did not like it. She can take a loan. Or someone else, who agrees with her, can pay either all the amount, or all the \"upgrades\".", "NTA. Good on you for offering to support your sister. But she\u2019s taking advantage and sounds like a spoiled brat. Stand your ground OP.", "NTA. Easy. Drive the ungrateful, apparently too smart for her own good sister to a bank and tell her to get a loan since she  *cannot* compromise and *must* use your money because she\u2019s entitled to it for, you know, decorations and her very expensive library fee. If she needs a co-signer, get your AH brother to do it.", "You are being more than generous with your offer.   Your sister needs to stop acting so entitled considering that she is asking you to pay for her.  She is being a choosing beggar. \n\nTell brother to put up the cash or stay out of it", "NTA \n\nTell your brother he can pay half of the tuition and keep his cakehole closed", "NTA. She can\u2019t demand just because she\u2019s your sister and you\u2019re making money. That being said, she\u2019s your little sister and you definitely love her. Maybe talk to her and get her to understand that you\u2019re business would be at risk if you don\u2019t make calculated decisions and compromises which would hinder her education even before she can get a job like you were planning. Then everything would go downhill. It\u2019s always important to prepare for the worst. Etc etc. try talking to her.", "NTA\n\nIvy League schools are expensive so I can imagine that you'd be putting a lot of money upfront. It's very very generous of you. What she's asking for is unreasonable, nobody needs decorative furniture or ergonomic stuff as a college student that needs to have other people pay their tuition.\n\nStand your ground on this one", "NTA.   \nKick her out.", "NTA\n\nUr generous to help at all and she's upset that she has to compromise.....well she can learn the worth of a dollar and pay for it herself. And she can thank her lucky stars you aren't charging her rent!", "She\u2019s clearly too immature to be truly grateful for anything you were willing to do for her.

What a selfish little girl you have on your hands. And entitled if she thinks that list is really \u201cneeds\u201d for her education.
