If you can\u2019t forgive, break up. \n\nBut they didn\u2019t. And as B grew into an adult my sister stayed where she had always been, an abusive child coddled into incompetence. \nRecently sister found out (through TikTok and a hard maybe from her therapist) that she thinks she\u2019s autistic. And since this she has been using it as a shield from any critic and as a reason she can\u2019t grow or hold down a job. \n\nB worked 45+ hours a week and went to school full time, while my sister did neither. He fully supported their living situation and her lifestyle of constantly buying new clothes and toys. When I would go over there, she would verbally abuse him from the time he got home (literally 11-12 at night because of work and school) til the time he fell asleep. She made him do every chore, be her waiter, her maid, etc. I cannot stress enough that she did nothing for the household while screaming at him constantly. \nIt was to the point where I had to stop going over there because I\u2019d get pissed, call her out, and she\u2019d blow up at me saying \u201che knows I\u2019m just joking\u201d \n\nNow, the other day he finally got the nerve to dump her. And I\u2019m super happy for him, cause he\u2019s a pretty cool guy who didn\u2019t deserve any of what she gave him. So I sent him a long winded version of \u201cI\u2019m sorry, prioritize your happiness, our family will miss you, and you\u2019ll do well with your ambition\u201d. \n\nHowever, apparently he sent her what I said and now the whole family is calling me an insensitive ahole for not supporting my sister through this hard time. I\u2019ve heard every excuse for her abuse, and I just don\u2019t buy any of it.

I also have BPD, and I strongly believe our mental issues are not an excuse for bad behavior. And I don\u2019t see how being autistic means being incapable of doing literally anything to help out.

Your abusive dead weight sister deserves far worse than you congratulating her victim for getting out.", "I have to wonder why he would send her your note. Seems stupid. Your sister has some real issues and needs therapy. As for supporting your sister - the support she needs is an intervention and directions to a good counselor. Now the only real aspect of this that I have to wonder about is why you chose to send that letter. If it was as you indicated to express good wishes and to be happy for him then definitely NTA. If you had any other motive then I\u2019d have a different response. \n\nNot sure why your family seems to think everyone needs to be supportive of your sister. She mistreated the guy, didn\u2019t do anything to help support herself, wasn\u2019t supportive of him while he worked and went to school, and was verbally abusive.

As a person who has Autism, it\u2019s not something I, or for anyone to brag or to use against someone as an excuse. \n\nAlso, kudos for you for wishing him well. You know that he didn\u2019t deserve your sisters attitude.", "I don't know if you're an AH (although I suspect you are), but you sound like an extremely unreliable narrator.", "NTA - you can wish the guy well, it doesn't necessarily mean you wouldn't be supportive of your sister. That wouldn't be okay in a situation where he was abusive (because it would come across as condoning the abuse or siding with the abuser). But in this case, it sounds as though she has some patterns she needs to address, and your family members might not be aware of it or might be minimizing, excusing and/or enabling that. \n\nThis might get closer to an ESH if you're not really friends with the guy and you were being passive aggressive or spiteful because you knew it would get back to her if you wished him well. It does sound as though you're a bit invested in their relationship, but that could be because you're frustrated with her behavior and you want her to change. If that's the case, explain that to her and/or your family. \n\nWas this her first serious relationship? 19 is still young (when they first got together). It's a good thing to be in therapy. Some people's first relationships can be pretty toxic, but it doesn't mean they can't grow and change. So hopefully she will.", "NTA - But maybe next time stay out of it. Family drama is a b\\*\\*\\*\\* even when you know your family are the assholes.", "Nta, I didn't do this but I was honestly very happy for a friend ex for the same reason. I'm not friends with her anymore because she is abusive to everyone in her life at some point. \n\nHe is for sending it to her and not keeping it to himself. \n\nShe obviously is. Mental illness doesn't excuse treating people horribly.", "NTA it doesn't really matter why she was abusive, he was victimised and its a good thing to support him and validate that.", "NTA- when my SIL comes to her senses and dumps my deadbeat brother, I\u2019ll help her pack.", "NTA. My girlfriend has BPD as well and says that mental illnesses/personality disorders are a reason for certain behaviours, but never ever excuses.\n\nIf she knows of her problems/assholery and refuses to do anything about it, she's 1000% the asshole.", "NTA wishing him well doesn\u2019t take support away from your sister.", "YTA for perpetuating the autism = bad trope.", "NTA.

You mentioned that B cheated on your sister early in their relationship.  However, you also excuse him because he was drunk and he apologized.  You also didn\u2019t mention any positive qualities of your sister.  I have to wonder if your perception (and, therefore, description) of the situation is skewed by your obvious only negative view of your sister and only positive view of B.  \n\nDo you know (for a fact) whether or not B has continued to cheat on your sister?  Does he continue to exhibit behaviors or act on impulses that he later excuses by saying that he was drunk?   \n\nI\u2019m sure there is more to this relationship that you aren\u2019t wary of.  No one is completely good/innocent or bad/malicious as you seemed to have painted B and your sister (respectively).\n\nAlso, did B ever tell you how things were between him and your sister?  How much/hard he was working or how he supported her?  How they treated each other? Just wondering how much of what you know was what you experienced or what you were told (and by B vs your sister)?  \n\n(Your comment on how much B worked and how much he supported your sister made me wonder how you knew that.  If B was the one who told you, it may be good to reflect on why he would tell his girlfriend\u2019s sister (or any other woman) that.)", "NTA.\n\nYeah, he shouldn't have cheated, and your sister has a right to be angry about that. But it's just as you said. She should have broken up with him if she couldn't forgive what her boyfriend did. She should get over herself instead of being an immature brat who uses autism as an excuse for not contributing anything. And your family is just as bad for coddling her.\n\nBoyfriend is also an AH. Not just because of the cheating, but more because he sent your conversation to your sister when it was none of her business.", "NTA omg I love this. Good for you on supporting the now ex boyfriend.", "My fianc\u00e9e just got diagnosed and I\u2019m probably on the spectrum myself. We make accommodations for eachother, she handles stuff I don\u2019t like and I handle stuff she doesn\u2019t like and we both pull our weight. This story sounds like someone who was a nightmare from the start looking for an excuse.", "Probably sent it as a \u201cEven your family sees the way you treated me was bad\u201d message", "OP didn\u2019t, though. Her sister was just claiming to have autism.", "OP is more so stating that ever since their sister got the POSSIBILITY of a diagnosis their family has bent over backwards making excuses for the sister. That everything she's done wrong is because she's autistic and not because she's an asshole. OP didn't give the vibe of \"autistic=bad\" more so \"sister is using it as a excuse\"", "I agree with you. It doesn\u2019t sound like this person is even trying.", "OP's should have just said it in person. My family has on-going drama over messages that was sent years ago.", "I get downvoted for saying how OP may have been thinking , not even for my own personal opinion. I hate Reddit", "Makes sense"]}
