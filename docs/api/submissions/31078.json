He had cheated on me with another woman, I heard a while back he got engaged to a different woman but I've been long over Dave so didn't really care about it much.\n\nOne thing about me, is I love spring time and I don't have like a huge binder or even a pininterest board on my dream wedding all I know is I want to get married in spring. Specifically on March 20th, where we live it's the time when spring is in full bloom and it's not too cold or hot to have it outdoors and even indoors is a great option if you choose the right venue. I haven't told many people this maybe my sisters, ,my friends and Dave. Before we broke up Dave and I had discussed marriage and I told him about my dream wedding date. He was hesitant about it cause his mom has allergies but as it was just a discussion I told him we'll work out a solution when the time comes. \n\nAbout a week ago, I hear from a friend about a joint Instagram post him and his fiance made (I've blocked Dave and don't follow his fiance either) it was a picture of Dave and her holding hands showing off her new engagement ring and underneath in the caption it read \"\ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd0d March 20th 2024\". To say I was shocked and hurt would've been an understatement but what was I to do, it wasn't like I could sue him for stealing my dream date but it really sucked that he'd hurt me like this after all he put me through. So I did what any sane person would and wallowed in self pity. That was till I got a call from unknown number two days ago. It was Dave and he was pissed. Apparently one of my friends commented under their post about them stealing my date I don't know exactly what the comment said but his fiance saw it first and dmed my friend to elaborate to which she explained that March 20 was the date I always wanted to be married on and well to cut things short thr fiance didn't know and lost her sh*t. She was extremely angry with Dave and things had gotten to the point where she wanted to call of the engagement. Dave called me screaming how dare I try to sabotage his relationship with his fiance and I didn't own the date and some incoherent stuff while yelling \"it's just a date, it's a date\" over and over again. I tried to talk but Dave wouldn't even let me get a proper sentence in and finally had enough saying \"Dave you did this to yourself. Not me, not my friend, not your fiance but him\" and hung up. I didn't need to block his number cause he hasn't tried to contact me since. His mom called my mom too telling how \"I screwed up her son's happiness\" and that I should do the right thing by talking to Dave's fiance and rectifying the situation. My mom obviously told her off with a few not so nice words but now his mom and sisters having been going around calling me Dave's spiteful ex. \n\nI really didn't know my friend was going to comment on their post but if I'm being honest I'm not upset about it either. I was a teen when I decided on the date and it was really special to me I would be lying if I didn't get some enjoyment out of this.

Maybe he forgot about that date?\n\nHalf of my friends married on a Saturday beginning of September. On our wedding, at midnight, we celebrated the anniversary of some friends.\n\nWhat I am wondering: Why the 20th of March? It's a Wednesday if I saw this correctly. Unusual date.", "AITA for enjoying seeing him reap the fruits of his own foolish choices?\n\nNope, you're good. \n\nNTA", "This can\u2019t be real. Surely people aren\u2019t this petty.", "So. If it was only your friend who commented on Instagram and not you? In this moment NTA. But. My observation? You are not over Dave. And? You might want to lighten your grip on getting married on a specific date. Life has its ways.", "NTA I wouldn't personally be upset cause you can always do your dream wedding. I would block dude and tell your friend it wasn't cool to say something and cause them drama.", "I\u2019d love to hear how Dave and his fianc\u00e9e decided on this date \ud83d\ude06in the first place.  \n\nYou are NTA.  Dave is. His mom is.  Your friend sort of is but I don\u2019t blame them. Stirring the pot a bit can be fun.

Every year the date falls on a different day of the week and next year in particular it happens to fall on a Wednesday. Who in their right mind would want to get married in the middle of a work week? Your ex is the AH for clearly stealing the date but you\u2019re definitely weird for clinging onto a particular date in March for no sentimental reason when you can easily fulfill the whole \u201cspring in full bloom and it\u2019s not too cold or hot\u201d thing the second to last week of March. It doesn\u2019t have to be exactly March 20th to fulfill that need.", "YTA and an immature one at that", "You are not the asshole....if everything is exactly as you say.\n\nThe main asshole is your friend. It's just a fucking date indeed, and you cannot really call \"dibs\" on a wedding date like you are 8 years old. She is to really blame for all this mess.\n\nHowever your story includes also some minion assholes, mainly his mother. She has no job going into all this mess and calling your mother. It's also weird that she called your mother and not you. What is she? A country's prime minister who only speaks/meets other prime ministers?\n\nDave also should behave better and not call you at all, although I give him some slack because to wake up suddenly one morning to all of this random shit would drive anyone crazy. Honestly, if I were him I would never believe that your friend just \"happened\" to make such a comment under the post. This looks more like you and your friend had some discussion and **even enabling her a bit to do it (if yes, then you are definitely the asshole, if not then only your friend is the asshole).**\n\nAlso in my opinion, it is very weird that you felt bad for just A DATE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, the way I see it, your friend should apologise and you all call it a day.", "You're not TA as you didn't take any action, but your friend sure is for stirring drama. Nobody owns a date. If he remembered your date and intentionally selected it he's just a silly, petty little man. If the unknowing fiance selected the date it's a non issue. I don't know that \"he did this to himself\" but as he was raging at you, I think saying that is fine. Honestly I'd have just hung up if he called, then blocked the number. He seems like a dramatic rage monster, if you truly didn't know your friend was going to comment you're somewhat sensitive, but not an AH. Your friend didn't need to get involved.", "NTA.

If you had contacted them or called them to air your grievances that would be a different story.\n\nLive your life and keep away from their relationship drama as its just not good to get involved.\n\nCheaters tend to cause trouble for themselves so i would not be shocked if she moves on from him and his ways.", "YTA - I\u2019m going to make an assumption here that you were vocal with your friends about this and that is what was the catalyst that started this IG comment.

You had zero influence on anything in that situation. Literally everyone involved acted independent of you.
