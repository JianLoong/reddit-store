He didn\u2019t address it maturely and instead of going after the action he went after your child as a person. Ditch the boyfriend, he will verbally abuse your children whenever he wants.", "I think this very much depends on a few things. \n\nFirst question, what kind of relationship does your BF have with your son?  Do you expect him to never tell him what to do?  Never correct him?   Or are you ok with those things.  Because if you are, then you sound a bit over protective.  \n\nThe second thing is tone.   The way you typed that out, it sounds pretty benign to me.   I think you are taking this to be as some kind of comment on his autism, but it just sounds like something people say.  \n\nBased on what is written, I'd say YTA.  But its very possible if I witnessed it, my opinion could be different", "You admit that what your son did was wrong but you're upset that your BF called him out over yet.\n\nYou then say that your son quickly brushed it off so he wasn't really affected by it aside from realizing he made a mistake. That means you're making this a bigger deal than it needs to be.\n\nYou also admit that you don't respect your own vehicle so your son is learning his bad behavior from you.\n\nYTA", "NTA. BF is being ridiculous. His foot isn\u2019t going to hurt the door.", "I'm going to say NAH because you're allowed to feel how you feel, your son doesn't seem particularly upset, and your BF is allowed to request his car be treated the way he prefers even if I personally find it sort of a weird hill to die on. But I do wonder if you're in the best relationship for both you and your kids if your BF puts stock in the material and you're more interested in how people feel.  Does this incident speak to a deeper communication issue between the two of you that should be addressed sooner than later?", "Honestly I don\u2019t think anyone is the AH here, but since that is the question, i will say soft YTA.\n\nThe situation could have been handled better, but sometimes things happend and no one is really an AH for it.\n\nBut it does sound like you two need to have a talk so you two are on the same page on things about the kids.\n\nAnd the kid seamed to understand right away that he did something he shouldn\u2019t, so no need to make a big deal about it. He probably won\u2019t do it again.", "NTA. The bf was out of line in the way he addressed the issue. Besides, everyone knows that when your hands are full you use your hip or your butt to close doors.", "YTA, you said it yourself , it's his 60K car, and you don't treat yours with respect, he didn't yell at your child, you're making this a bigger deal than it needs to be", "YTA. You don't shut other people's car doors with your foot. Your son is old enough to know how to treat other people's things. I am impressed that the BF just raised his voice. Honestly that must have taken a lot of restraint. He also didn't curse. \n\nIf it bugs you that much, talk to the BF and have him have a 1 on 1 with your son. He can explain that he doesn't actually think there is anything wrong with him, and that he just like keeping his nice things nice. This should be a very simple conversation. \n\nIn the future, your son will do things that are wrong. Other people will call him out for it. Obviously, don't let them curse him out, but let him receive negative feedback. \n\nThere is a time to be defensive when people are cruel or in the wrong, this wasn't that.", "YTA that it's gone this far and it took you this fucking long to notice. Do you not see that your son is responding like a kicked puppy?\n\nETA: I just saw the part you buried, about how your boyfriend bruised your child. *You are a complete fucking failure as a parent.*", "NTA, that\u2019s your son. You get to choose who you keep around him. If you are concerned, I strongly suggest you consider it. A gut feeling means something.", "With \"his foot\" I guess with the sole of his shoes.  \n\nYTA.  \n\nYour BF was right to call him out on it.", "YTA. I\u2019d be pretty irked if someone used their foot to close my car door. I work hard for my money and to have someone disrespect my property is basically disrespecting me.\nThis is how your BF felt. Your son maybe on the spectrum but that doesn\u2019t give him a free pass to do things like this.\nWhat you\u2019re upset about is that your BF\u2019s words hit home about how perhaps you should have taught your child a little better when it comes to stuff like this. No one is perfect but you need to teach your kids about manners and respect. Just because you drive an old car and use your feet to close the door, it doesn\u2019t mean that behaviour can rub off onto other people\u2019s property.\nYou and your son need to apologise to him.", "YTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong with what he said or how he said it.", "How did this end up? It sounds like bf was maybe a little too critical (are these his kids, or does he have any?), but it also sounds like your son got the message, apologized, and gave a pretty good 11yo excuse, i.e., \"I wasn't thinking.\" Because 11yo kids often do stuff and don't think, and maybe now he will. \n\nAlso, worth asking bf how he thinks shutting the door might go with full hands. Is a hip-check okay? Like, what would he have suggested? I would't ask in a snarky way, just genuinely curious. If this is the only issue, then I would want to make things regarding his car clear to the kids. Clarity is good for everyone.", "YTA who taught your kid that it's acceptable to close a car door with your foot? You never stated how you called out your bf either. I think it's fine to point out to him that using that kind of wording could really hurt, if he can try to keep criticisms constructive instead.", "YTA, he didn\u2019t call the kid an idiot or anything like that. He didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Get over it.", "NTA. i would probably do the same thing if my hands were full. as long as he wasn\u2019t forcibly kicking the door, it seems like an honest mistake. i don\u2019t think it\u2019s disrespectful at all. however as long as this is a one-off incident and your boyfriend doesn\u2019t usually treat your kids that way, i don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily worth making a big deal about. if he does routinely say stuff like that/criticize your parenting, that would be a bigger problem.", "NTA", "ESH Your kids need to learn to respect other people's property. Your bf has no business using phrases like that with any kid whether or not they're on any particular spectrum.", "The clear divide on whether or not closing a car door with a foot being wrong is quite comical. Closing a door of any kind with a foot is different than kicking a door closed with a foot, the latter definitely being inappropriate. But just closing a door (regardless of its monetary value) with a foot? That\u2019s doing no more harm than closing the door with your hand. NTA.", "YTA. I\u2019ve never closed a car door with my foot because I wasn\u2019t raised by wolves. Teach your child better.", "Info: how did you actually react? What did \"calling out\" your boyfriend entail in this case?", "Soft YTA. You are correct that you\u2019re overprotective. Are you going to be able to follow your son around his entire life to ensure nobody ever says anything unpleasant to him? No. \n\nIt\u2019s better he learn the social skills to deal with these kinds of things now while he\u2019s a child, rather than being out in the real world as a grown man and having a meltdown the first time someone corrects him without mom there to protect him. \n\nIn terms of your boyfriend, I don\u2019t know how serious your relationship is, but if he has any kind of parenting role you can ask him that he explain to your son exactly why using his foot was wrong so your son can understand the situation better and not take it personally. But it seems your son did understand and you\u2019re the only one bent out of shape here.", "YTA.\n\nYour coddling your child.  Your bf said nothing out of line.  You're just being Uber defensive because it's your son.  Don't do that.", "NTA. Why wouldn't you use your foot to close the car door if your hands were full? It's not like he kicked a dent in the car. Don't date a dude who is more concerned about getting his car dirty than he is about your kid.", "NTA", "YTA. First, it\u2019s a pretty obvious thing not to do, even for an 11 year old. But mostly because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s actually anything wrong with what your bf said.", "NAH - you\u2019re over sensitive given your son\u2019s diagnosis and your bf used a very common phrase to express displeasure in someone\u2019s behavior. It\u2019s a good learning opportunity for all of you.", "Nope. Boyfriend can get bent. I seriously doubt the car was fatally damaged, but BF left an unnecessary bruise on the kid.\n\nThere's ways of handing petty offences. You start by recognizing them as petty offences.\n\nTaste of the possible future for your relationship as a family.\n\nHe shoulda just made the kid wax the car. Wax on. Fuck off. Wax on. Fuck off.", "What do you think he should have done?", "YTA. Not closing a car door with your foot is playing common sense. Your son was wrong.", "Nta. The first stuff he said was fine, but asking \u201cwhat is wrong with you\u201d over a minor incident was too far.", "What's wrong with you? Under the circumstances, what you BF said to your son was pretty benign. Who wouldn't be upset to see their property abused in this manner?\n\nYes, YTA. Autistic people can learn manners and respect, too.", "YTA.  It is commonly accepted that you do not close a door with your foot.  Even if the car was old this was not acceptable.", "YTA.  Teach your kids to respect others belongings.", "YTA. \n\nSeriously? Get a grip. \n\nHell, I\u2019d say that to my own kids. It\u2019s a benign comment. \n\nTeach your kid better and it would be a non-issue.", "YTA. My youngest is 6 and she knows how to shut a car door properly.", "You know what your son did is wrong and yet you\u2019re trying to find any excuse for him. YTA and no wonder he doesn\u2019t respect things or people if this is how he\u2019s raised", "\"What's wrong with you\" is figure of speech. Your son should not be using his foot to close the door, that's wrong.", "Yta. What was said is not that bad, and seems appropriate.", "YTA it's not that serious.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019d ask/say the same thing, kid or adult. Seriously crappy behavior.", "Minor ESH\n\nWhen I was young, my dad would say \"what is *wrong* with you!?\" every time I made a minor mistake. That language stuck with me, especially when I was diagnosed with ADHD later in life. All I could of was that dad was right; there *is* something wrong with me.\n\nYes, your son should not have used his foot. But your boyfriend shouldn't have used that specific language when a \"don't do that!\" would have been just fine. Talk to your bf about it", "YTA. It was a fairly mild expression of frustration, and your son clearly didn\u2019t take it hard. Why the drama?", "YTA.
