I even texted their mother and made arrangements for my youngest SD14 and she act like she was on board with it. We have this ongoing issue with my step kids about them only coming over when we are doing something fun, every time we try to get them and just spend time with them at the house they make up every excuse in the book why they cannot come. \n\nI purposely did not tell them or my kids what the plans were this weekend. SD18 couldn\u2019t get off of work so I told her it\u2019s cool we will do something for her later on, no big deal in understand how it is working retail during the holidays. Today I texted their mother to confirm if SD14 were coming over tomorrow and she said SD14 had a long week and was really emotional and did not want to go to our house without her older sister (total BS, she doesn\u2019t even like her sister like that and she\u2019s been to our house plenty of times without her sister) just another excuse on why she cannot come. Mind you, it\u2019s my hubby court ordered weekend with her anyways. We don\u2019t make her come over so we just get her whenever she wants to come over. So I texted their mom back and said \u201cno big deal, we will do something else with them another time\u201d So SD18 texted me a little while ago asking what were doing and told her we are spending the weekend at Disney and another event. I told her so she wouldn\u2019t be surprised when photos are posted this weekend\n\nNow all of she wants to call out of work and my other SD14 wants to come without her sister now lol I told them \u201cI\u2019m sorry I gave the boys friends those tickets because y\u2019all didn\u2019t want to come over\u201d (I really did) so now they are pissed off and apart of me doesn\u2019t feel bad for SD14. SD18 is understandable because she actually has a good excuse but I do not want her calling out because she\u2019s on the verge of getting fired already for her attendance. Hubby wants to cave in and let her come but I don\u2019t want too because I\u2019m over her only wanting to see us when we\u2019re spending money on her. I want this too be a lesson to SD14 and he doesn\u2019t see it that way. I gave her an opportunity to come and she didn\u2019t want too sooooo\u2026..\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: before anyone says I\u2019m being unfair to my SK, I treat my BIO kids the same way. My oldest had his fair share of missing out on events. He knows better now lol when I say get in the car and let\u2019s go, don\u2019t question it \ud83d\ude02 just get in\n\nETA: it\u2019s not a game I\u2019m playing. Over the years I just got tired of feeling used. The only time they want to come over is when we\u2019re doing something or they want something. That\u2019s why I stopped telling them what we were doing. My husband is cheap and doesn\u2019t care for fun things. I plan and pay for just about everything we do that\u2019s \u201cfun\u201d we all have a good relationship and they are growing older and they rather be with friends so we are trying to give them the space to do that but before SD18 got a job, we would try to plan things with them, my kids included, and it just became a \u201ccan we go here instead\u201d and complaining about everything so that\u2019s why now if I want to do something I don\u2019t tell them plans, I just ask them if they are coming and if they don\u2019t then they stay home. All of the kids are in different age groups so I try to plan things for each child and invite the others but that\u2019s been extremely difficult because of the complaining.", "created_utc": 1670524118, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zg70sn/aita_for_giving_away_my_step_kids_disney_tickets/", "score": 1949, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How often do you do this \"I'm planning something but won't tell you\" type thing?  As people get older, they start to have lives separate from their parents, which is fine.  They are going to start to prioritize which events they partake in, and trying to keep everything a secret is not respecting their time or emotional energy.", "YTA. Your spouse should be doing all the logistics and communicating with his children. You seem to like playing head games.", "NTA.

They had their chance to spend time with OP and family, who made it clear they all wanted to spend time with the two stepdaughters.

Yes, they\u2019re teenagers, that\u2019s what they do. Bring them on the trip, the memories you make with them as a family are more valuable then pulling off your elaborate trick. Otherwise, just admit that you\u2019d rather they didn\u2019t come because you resent their choice to base decisions around activities.", "also yta for demanding that they just get on board. 18 is adult, i would like to know the activity to before going. \nmaybe the mindgames and the bossyness make them not want to come over.", "YTA I get that you want them to spend time with you and your family, but they also don\u2019t have to do something they have no interest in, they can bow out if they rather not do a specific activity, I\u2019m sure you do the same with friends and family. What would be helpful is speaking with them to understand why they stay at a distance and only involve themselves on certain things. \n\nThe whole post just made you sound manipulative really, regardless whether you do this to your bio kids. As an adult there are much better ways to communicate with children. Your behavior is not at all appealing. You\u2019re definitely not someone I would want to be around, half the time I would be wondering if I\u2019m getting played by answering your questions/suggestions.

She probably would have gotten permission if the boss knew it was a planned vacation instead of just calling out.\n\nYou're basically punishing the kids because of YOUR lack of communication skills.

You expected an 18yo with a job and a life to just plan around you while hiding what she\u2019s planning for. Of course she didn\u2019t push for the time off. You sound difficult.

Maybe if you had actually communicated instead of being purposely difficult and then being a jerk about it your step kids would actually want to be at your house.", "YTA.  I wouldn\u2019t want to spend time with someone so manipulative either.  To be clear, the court, the father, and the kids all say they want this weekend together.

I feel like a lot of people seem to have not realized NEITHER kid wanted to go until AFTER they found out it was a trip to Disney. It honestly seemed like neither of them wanted to celebrate the holidays or their step-brothers' birthdays with you. Now, I don't believe 18yr is an asshole, though it IS suspicious she can suddenly take time off when it's a trip to Disney. I also can't say that 14yr is an asshole either. It could be a case of parental alienation, if the context of 'she doesn't like her older sister' is true.\n\nIn fact, could it be possible that bio mom didn't even TELL her about you guys wanting her this weekend?", "ESH- except the kids. Ok maybe the kids a little bit too. \n\nYou are playing hide and seek with the events, why the heck isn\u2019t dad dealing with his kids and the ex directly, ex is pulling the kids around to suit herself.  \n\nThe kids are learning to manipulate the adults in their lives and that is a shame. It happens far too often when the parents get divorced.", "YTA The 18 year old I feel like she should have been told before you gave ticket away. She has a job. Taking off to spend time sitting around with parents and siblings is a whole lot different than calling out to go to Disney, especially if they rarely get to go or have never been.", "NTA if your husband knew.", "NTA.

My son now understands that when I say get in the car, to just get in the car. He too had to miss a few things before he got the point that I wasn't an ATM but his mother who wanted to spend time with him. Its not about the money spent but the time shared.", "NTA. Relationships are 2-way streets.", "NTA. To those saying YTA, if you read the post you would know this was not a one off situation.

Great lesson!!", "NTA they said no initially, they can miss out", "NTA the SKs are just using you.  They are mad because they got caught.  They're not your kids or your problem.  If you don't stand your ground now it won't get better.  They are either part of your life or not.  Either is fine but you're a parent not a wallet.", "Nta. They had a chance.

I\u2019m glad you gave them the chance to decide to celebrate without saying you\u2019re going to Disney because that feels a little bribery and they showed their true feelings on your family gathering. Maybe next time they will want to see you guys. Maybe not. But you\u2019re offering", "NTA. I totally understand your position. It is sad that their dad doesn\u2019t see that they want to come over when fun things are happening, but didn\u2019t think that celebrating their brothers\u2019 birthdays was fun enough to make an effort.

Unfortunately, not every family moment can be fun, expensive, and brag worthy. If her steps were invested in celebrating their new sibling they would have made the time to come.

They could also just be burned out from the week and not feel like interacting with step and half siblings.\n\nGoing back and forth to different homes is really hard on kids.  No matter how hard people try to co-parent together, the other house does things differently, have different rules and a different schedule.  It's really hard on kids.

As someone who grew up with a mother who frequently would invite me or my sisters out with no set plan or just intending to grab a bite, and it would turn into shopping trips or movie dates- I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for not disclosing your plans. (Partly because you\u2019re an adult and telling children your plans is not a prerequisite of attendance. It\u2019s not like they can afford to go on their own -maybe the 18yo, but her ticket was bought so irrelevant- your plans don\u2019t need approval by the ppl you\u2019re paying for) Particularly though, because plans change.

Some of y\u2019all are saying the older one works but this was for a bday and Xmas, important naturally (both of which land on the same date every year).

Again, doesn\u2019t make them bad ppl. \n\nBut the mom isn\u2019t bad for not running her plans by then. ESPECIALLY, when they turned the plans down before even knowing what they were. She can\u2019t be TA for not telling them the specifics when they never asked and only cared to come after they turned it down. \n\nWhen I learned that going out with my mom and potentially getting something was better than gambling on her sticking to the plan, I went all the time. And obvi, I didn\u2019t get something all the time but it did effectively bring us closer. It also very much taught me to be a little daring. Go out when I\u2019m kinda tired. Take a day off even if I don\u2019t know the plan. Because you don\u2019t know what may happen. The family could\u2019ve went somewhere else much more boring and won tickets to Disney for whoever was in attendance. (Two tickets could easily be bought) but the point is that they wouldn\u2019t have tickets then either cuz they decided is was boring and didn\u2019t go. They didn\u2019t take a chance.

They may be kids but they\u2019re not little. These kind of habits \u201conly spending time with my family for vacations or big expenditures\u201d can and will carry into adulthood (as seen by my sibling who does this very thing). If you want to teach them not to be selfish with their family or abuse the generosity of them, this is a pretty simple and harmless way.

So probably 4x in that month, I called in last minute  \u201csick\u201d (hungover). \n\nThat immediately put me on probation and after that the managers were pissed, and my coworkers weren\u2019t willing to cover for me anymore, because I was frequently fucking up their days off with no notice. \n\nMaybe step daughters work sucks in general. But more likely, if she\u2019s already on probation and not getting leeway, she\u2019s probably for real been irresponsible. \n\nOr had really terrible luck with absolutely no proof.

Most retailers black out all weekends off in December.", "Retail =/= healthcare.", "But of course she can miss work now because it's Disney", "Thanks, something about OP's tone in the post and the replies screamed \"missing missing reasons\" to me.", "Just because a teen is being a brat (note, I think the 13 yo was wrong for how she acted in the previous post), does not mean that OP can kick her out. Being kicked out is wrong for *any* reason.", "The goal is to have the kids decide on the relevant question, do you want to spend time with your family?\n\nThe answer was no. They were willing to tolerate they family for a free trip, but clearly had no interest in celebrating with them.", "OP asked in advance and requesting off is much different than calling out. Requesting off is much less likely to get her fired, but it sounds like she didn't care to put in the time.\n\nShe's 18 and gets a little less sympathy because it requesting time off gets you fired, you've beyond abused that privilege already", "Well, sadly if you continuously use people and only show up when there's money being spent on you, people will get tired of paying for you.", "OP said she couldn\u2019t not that she didn\u2019t. I read it as she requested and was refused which is super common in retail near Christmas. My old job you used to have to request weekends in December almost 5 months ahead because they capped the number of people that could be away everyday.", "It wasn't just birthdays, it was Christmas which fell in Dad's custody time.   That wasn't enough for either to plan to be there so yeah, they missed out big time.", "Baby showers, birthdays, graduations, allat", "I\u2019d had it written into work contracts, even starting a new company, I always had my birthday off. Nothing special perhaps going on, but it\u2019s one day a year that\u2019s supposed to be about me and hell if I was doing anything but what I wanted to.", "But she works retail so it\u2019s not like she had to use vacation or pto time. She simply had to ask to work different days that week.", "Just because *you* don\u2019t doesn\u2019t meant others don\u2019t. Almost ***everyone*** I know takes days off for their birthdays. It\u2019s not some rare thing.", "The sort of job an 18 year old probably has, it's likely that all they need is to request the time off and the workplace schedules around it.\n\nAnd two months notice is more than ample time.", "Because I and most people are not willing to put people in a bind (or risk the bad will) for multiple days off if really all we needed to take off was an hour or two early for a movie and dinner, or come in a couple hours late for morning present opening and brunch.", "We told the kids at dinner one night to go to bed early because they had an early surprise. Woke them up, I\u2019d already packed their bags, and off we went driving to Disneyland. Didn\u2019t tell them until they were already wide awake half way there.", "Same. \n\nMy parents put me in the car and said \u201croad trip.\u201d And I didn\u2019t particularly ask questions. Besides \u201csomewhere warm?\u201d \u201cSomewhere cold?\u201d\n\nWe left from the NW tip of Washington, and I didn\u2019t ask for like 12 hours. Until we were in a hotel\u2026Somewhere. \n\nMy dad then handed me a map, that had Anaheim CA circled on it. \n\nI didn\u2019t put it together at 10. But I had seen a sign somewhere that said \u201cLong Beach\u201d, and I assumed that meant Long Beach WA. \n\nWe drove for another two days and made 50 stops, with me still assuming we were just driving to a tiny beach town in WA. Instead of realizing we were well in California. \n\nI was fully psyched because I knew there was an arcade where I thought we were going. Didn\u2019t realize by the scenery or the traffic that we had left our home state a long time ago. \n\nMy parents finally pulled into a castle shaped hotel a block away from Disneyland and looked at me expectantly, like I should have figured it out by now WITH a map. \n\nApparently I said \u201cawwe. The pools outdoor instead of indoor. I wish it was warm enough to swim\u201d. And then as soon as I got out of the car realized it was 85 degrees and just looked baffled. \n\nWelcome to Disneyland, really unobservant me.", "I mean that\u2019s cute as a 4 year Old that barely has a concept of personal autonomy or any responsibility for their own scheduling.\n\nAs a teenager, especially one with a job, never knowing what you\u2019re going to get carted off somewhere or for how long and being able to prepare appropriately is stressful.", "I thought Mall of America would be ridiculous. That\u2019s the only lie they didn\u2019t laugh at.", "Or, hear me out, don\u2019t design huge \u201csurprises\u201d where someone can totally miss it by having the audacity to have a job?\n\nTypically, if you\u2019re going to surprise someone, you take steps to ensure they get their surprise.  You don\u2019t use it as a weird loyalty test.", "Doesn\u2019t matter that she\u2019s 18, she like her sister still only wants to go there if she gets something out of it.", "I never feel like we get the whole story though in this sub. I don't know.", "Thank you. Well said.\nI'm huge on respecting the boundaries of others. (I also enforce my boundaries, so recognize that boundaries are essential.). I get confused when someone is angry that I respect their boundaries.", "Your point is valid for the 14 year old. \nThe 18 year old is now a legal adult with a job, and perhaps isn\u2019t under a court order anyway. So it\u2019s not like she\u2019s \u201csupposed to be with him.\u201d She\u2019s supposed to be working, and OP asked her to call off for days for a birthday celebration but didn\u2019t explain further. \n\nYou can\u2019t treat young adults like that and expect them to bow to your every wish, it\u2019s not going to work out.", "First, it\u2019s only one of their weekends. The other is 18 and they need to be more mindful that teenagers, especially ones that are technically adults, have lives that they\u2019re not willing to drop for any random \u201csurprise.\u201d \n\nOP honestly sounds like a damn nightmare. Sure, this time it was an actually fun trip, but how many times over the years have they had it randomly demanded that they get in a car only to end up inappropriately dressed or at something miserable? It sounds like OP has created an environment of constant tension and uncertainty for two kids who already went through their parents divorcing. It\u2019s not really a surprise they don\u2019t want to do anything with them at this point unless they know they\u2019ll like it. I know I\u2019m personally willing to grit my teeth through a lot more for the sake of others in a consistent environment where I can plan ahead, whereas I need a lot more reassurance to visit loved ones where the relationship is volatile.", "I really hope your personal relationships are not as shallow and surface level as you expect this family's to be and you actually develop a deeper connection than \"do you wanna?\".", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss \u2764\ufe0f", "Yeah I REFUSE to work on my bday. Even when I know I\u2019m not doing shit, I guarantee you my ass will NOT be working.", "She asked her weeks in advance to request the time off for the entire weekend to celebrate the holidays and her brother's birthday. She specifically stated that. The SD said she didn't want to. Now she's changed her mind because it's disneyland. I have 4 kids. 20, 18, 7, and 5. I do not feel bad for those girls. They wanted nothing to do with spending time with their father, SM, and brother until disneyland was involved.", "They obv live in the area I'm pretty sure this isn't a once in a lifetime opp and also, if you're old enough to have a job, you're going to miss out on stuff and you've prob been to Disney.", "Yeah, this one in particular sounds weird and almost made up.", "If you think that\u2019s bad, imagine a relationship based solely on what resources someone can extract from you!", "I don\u2019t ALWAYS skip my bday. But I do any time my friend is able to celebrate with me! And I skip on HER bday, too! Well, technically I don\u2019t skip, as I have plenty of leave to use, but \u201cskip\u201d sounds more fun and rebellious. \ud83d\ude02", "Agree.", "Like the step kids are doing? When they weren't interested until they knew they could get a Disney trip out of it?\n\nMy whole point was to develop a deeper and meaningful connection. Otherwise, they should just slip them some money every time they visit if the *only* goal is to spend time with them and the motivation doesn't matter at all.", "Well the kids just saw the result of their current approach to the relationship, hopefully that prompts some introspection.\n\nOP is specifically working to avoid a relationship based on bribing them to be present. You can\u2019t force someone to care about you, you can only give them opportunities to be involved."]}
