I even texted their mother and made arrangements for my youngest SD14 and she act like she was on board with it. We have this ongoing issue with my step kids about them only coming over when we are doing something fun, every time we try to get them and just spend time with them at the house they make up every excuse in the book why they cannot come. \n\nI purposely did not tell them or my kids what the plans were this weekend. SD18 couldn\u2019t get off of work so I told her it\u2019s cool we will do something for her later on, no big deal in understand how it is working retail during the holidays. Today I texted their mother to confirm if SD14 were coming over tomorrow and she said SD14 had a long week and was really emotional and did not want to go to our house without her older sister (total BS, she doesn\u2019t even like her sister like that and she\u2019s been to our house plenty of times without her sister) just another excuse on why she cannot come. Mind you, it\u2019s my hubby court ordered weekend with her anyways. We don\u2019t make her come over so we just get her whenever she wants to come over. So I texted their mom back and said \u201cno big deal, we will do something else with them another time\u201d So SD18 texted me a little while ago asking what were doing and told her we are spending the weekend at Disney and another event. I told her so she wouldn\u2019t be surprised when photos are posted this weekend\n\nNow all of she wants to call out of work and my other SD14 wants to come without her sister now lol I told them \u201cI\u2019m sorry I gave the boys friends those tickets because y\u2019all didn\u2019t want to come over\u201d (I really did) so now they are pissed off and apart of me doesn\u2019t feel bad for SD14. SD18 is understandable because she actually has a good excuse but I do not want her calling out because she\u2019s on the verge of getting fired already for her attendance. Hubby wants to cave in and let her come but I don\u2019t want too because I\u2019m over her only wanting to see us when we\u2019re spending money on her. I want this too be a lesson to SD14 and he doesn\u2019t see it that way. I gave her an opportunity to come and she didn\u2019t want too sooooo\u2026..\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: before anyone says I\u2019m being unfair to my SK, I treat my BIO kids the same way. My oldest had his fair share of missing out on events. He knows better now lol when I say get in the car and let\u2019s go, don\u2019t question it \ud83d\ude02 just get in\n\nETA: it\u2019s not a game I\u2019m playing. Over the years I just got tired of feeling used. The only time they want to come over is when we\u2019re doing something or they want something. That\u2019s why I stopped telling them what we were doing. My husband is cheap and doesn\u2019t care for fun things. I plan and pay for just about everything we do that\u2019s \u201cfun\u201d we all have a good relationship and they are growing older and they rather be with friends so we are trying to give them the space to do that but before SD18 got a job, we would try to plan things with them, my kids included, and it just became a \u201ccan we go here instead\u201d and complaining about everything so that\u2019s why now if I want to do something I don\u2019t tell them plans, I just ask them if they are coming and if they don\u2019t then they stay home. All of the kids are in different age groups so I try to plan things for each child and invite the others but that\u2019s been extremely difficult because of the complaining.", "created_utc": 1670524118, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zg70sn/aita_for_giving_away_my_step_kids_disney_tickets/", "score": 4715, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How often do you do this \"I'm planning something but won't tell you\" type thing?  As people get older, they start to have lives separate from their parents, which is fine.

Yes, they\u2019re teenagers, that\u2019s what they do. Bring them on the trip, the memories you make with them as a family are more valuable then pulling off your elaborate trick.

What would be helpful is speaking with them to understand why they stay at a distance and only involve themselves on certain things. \n\nThe whole post just made you sound manipulative really, regardless whether you do this to your bio kids.

I wouldn\u2019t want to spend time with someone so manipulative either.  To be clear, the court, the father, and the kids all say they want this weekend together.

It happens far too often when the parents get divorced.", "YTA The 18 year old I feel like she should have been told before you gave ticket away. She has a job.

As someone who grew up with a mother who frequently would invite me or my sisters out with no set plan or just intending to grab a bite, and it would turn into shopping trips or movie dates- I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for not disclosing your plans. (Partly because you\u2019re an adult and telling children your plans is not a prerequisite of attendance. It\u2019s not like they can afford to go on their own -maybe the 18yo, but her ticket was bought so irrelevant- your plans don\u2019t need approval by the ppl you\u2019re paying for) Particularly though, because plans change.

Again, doesn\u2019t make them bad ppl. \n\nBut the mom isn\u2019t bad for not running her plans by then. ESPECIALLY, when they turned the plans down before even knowing what they were. She can\u2019t be TA for not telling them the specifics when they never asked and only cared to come after they turned it down. \n\nWhen I learned that going out with my mom and potentially getting something was better than gambling on her sticking to the plan, I went all the time. And obvi, I didn\u2019t get something all the time but it did effectively bring us closer. It also very much taught me to be a little daring. Go out when I\u2019m kinda tired. Take a day off even if I don\u2019t know the plan. Because you don\u2019t know what may happen. The family could\u2019ve went somewhere else much more boring and won tickets to Disney for whoever was in attendance. (Two tickets could easily be bought) but the point is that they wouldn\u2019t have tickets then either cuz they decided is was boring and didn\u2019t go. They didn\u2019t take a chance. They gambled n lost. Mom\u2019s not an asshole for not showing her hand before they folded. \n\nNTA (and even a small NAH cuz kids are kids)\n\n**Small edit: also, teaching your kids in their teens is probably the last chance you have of instilling the lesson of not taking advantage of your family by only being around them when it benefits in some way. They may be kids but they\u2019re not little. These kind of habits \u201conly spending time with my family for vacations or big expenditures\u201d can and will carry into adulthood (as seen by my sibling who does this very thing).

Be the adult here.", "going with YTA. \n\ni don\u2019t think the step kids\u2019 motive is to use you. some children of divorce are never completely comfortable with their step family, but participating in fun activities can make things much more bearable. you should honestly consider why your step kids don\u2019t want to be around their step family when it\u2019s not a super fun activity. maybe they have bad experiences with you, maybe they just feel a bit awkward, etc. i\u2019ve had a step family for over a decade now and i\u2019m still not fully comfortable with them, and that\u2019s not even because they\u2019re bad people. I\u2019m a pretty anxious person so I never got used to my step family. when I\u2019m at my step family\u2019s house without my older brother, who I\u2019m not close to AT ALL (we didn\u2019t even live together after the divorce because we preferred living with a different parent lol), i don\u2019t feel very comfortable. so i don\u2019t think you can say that the 14 y/o wanting to be with her older sister is BS. also, I mainly live with my mom, so going to my step family\u2019s house is kinda boring because I hate transporting all my things to their house whenever I go (even though it\u2019s a short drive). \n\nrather than trying to teach your step kids a lesson by intentionally tricking them into missing out on fun trips, why don\u2019t you take these trips as opportunities to bond more with your step kids?", "Also as an adult who has a life, there is in fact a massive difference between \u201cTake an entire weekend off to hangout and Bond over a birthday and holiday\u201d which lends itself to a ton of time where the family has likely wandered into their own rooms and split up to do their own thing since the option exists, making it feel like you should have gone to work and both made money for bills and not shorted the staffing, and \u201cwe\u2019re going to a theme park and possibly staying in a hotel/ out of state\u201d meaning its totally necessary to take time off and short the staffing.   Everyone is saying \u201cobviously they should of expected at least X because the OP said Y\u201d but not all families work like that.  I know people whose actual celebration and togetherness on holidays is actually only about 2 hours worth of time but they act like everyone needs to be there all day.  Same with birthdays, I know people who acted like it was going to be an all day event but the get together was like 3 hours for cake and food then the birthday person left because they had plans elsewhere. So for them it was an all day event but the rest of us could easily have worked an evening shift.  We don\u2019t know if the OP actually has a history of requesting the step daughter take time off for events that didn\u2019t actually require it.  The OP obviously wouldn\u2019t be inclined to tell us if part of Step-Daughters work attendance issue is actually because of taking time off for the OP.  The OP made it clear she does this kind of thing regularly and its possible that the 18 year old just is sick of playing these games.  Just because the OP presents as \u201cthey only come around when\u201d doesn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t a history of \u201cwe constantly invite them over to do things we know they won\u2019t enjoy (possibly because the OPs bio sons enjoy it) while claiming next time they\u2019ll do something the step will enjoy, only for the next time to seemingly never come. I\u2019m not making excuses for the 14 year old skipping a court ordered weekend but the 18 year old definitely had a right to know exactly why she would need that time off especially because there could have been retail blackout dates that the OP needed to consider if she actually wanted the girl to come.  Though even if the 14 year old has a history of not caring for her sister it is possible that the family actually treats her in a manner that makes it clear that she\u2019s from \u201cthe other family\u201d and being othered is easier with another black sheep than it is alone.  It\u2019s also easier being othered if the activity presented is interesting enough to distract you.  We really only have the OPs claims that the step daughters are just brats to go on.  Even her saying \u201cthe complain the entire time\u201d could be her leaving out \u201cthat the boys treat them badly and I make it clear they are their fathers children not family\u201d.   There is not enough info here to make a proper judgement, we need the girl\u2019s side of things.     Edit***.  I say this especially because if the OP is responsible for the previously noted post about telling dad to only visit the younger one away from the cause she\u2019s a brat, she specifically notes that the 17 year old still came around because she enjoyed it.  So a year later she suddenly \u201cnever comes around unless\u201d.

The BF wasn\u2019t really correcting his daughter and instead letting everything side. The SD13 was being rude and the SM said if you\u2019re going to act like this towards me in my home then stay at your moms. Which apparently made SD13 now 14 cry.

She says her husband acts like a boundary-free fun dad during his custody time.\n\nIt certainly sounds like a whole mess, but I don\u2019t think OP is helping anything.  You know those two kids don\u2019t want to spend time with your family.  I don\u2019t think playing this scenario out to prove it and punish them does anything positive.\n\nThere\u2019s also a streak of self-centered thinking through all this.

She says parents should care more about their spouse than their children because the children will grow up and leave them.\n\n> before anyone says I\u2019m being unfair to my SK, I treat my BIO kids the same way.

It\u2019s not just wanting to surprise your kids once in a while.  Constantly expecting them to leave all plans to you is not the same thing.\n\nYou\u2019ve got a shaky, strained relationship with this 14 year old.  You have real problems with her - she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with your family, and she acts out at your house.\n\nPlanning an event you know she\u2019ll hate missing out on and then inviting her without telling her what it is, so that she\u2019ll find an excuse not to go and then feel bad for missing it doesn\u2019t help those real problems at all.  It won\u2019t improve her relationship with OP or her family.  It won\u2019t help her behavior around OP.  It\u2019s designed to make her compliant to OP\u2019s plans.  To just go along with what OP wants for fear of missing out when OP wants to do something fun.\n\nReally, it just feels like throwing gas on a fire.  I expect it will do more to reinforce negative things about her relationship with OP and her father than it will do to improve her behavior.\n\nI can understand OP\u2019s issue with the children complaining about plans and trying to change them.  I can maybe see her reaction to that but I still don\u2019t think this is the way, especially when handling a relationship with an 18 year old.  They\u2019re a quasi-adult and evidently trying to juggle their familial relationships and work obligations.  Telling them what plans are and respecting their independence is important.\n\nOP compares the step-kids behavior to her own children\u2019s, and I think that\u2019s an issue on two fronts.  Her kids are much younger, and her step kids seem to have had a pretty unstable relationship with their father.  Both of those things are going to affect their behavior and the ways OP should relate to them a lot.\n\n> before anyone says I\u2019m being unfair to my SK, I treat my BIO kids the same way.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t really work when your bio kid is seven and has a stable loving relationship with his mother, while the step kip is fourteen and doesn\u2019t have that with you or her father.\n\nI don\u2019t know how old OP\u2019s oldest is.  From what I saw one of her kids was 7 eight months ago.  But OP is 28, so the oldest is probably not 14.\n\nIn a lot of ways, going through OP\u2019s previous post makes me more sympathetic to her.  She\u2019s 28 married to a 38 year old military man who was frequently absent during his first marriage (not sure about now).  He\u2019s also apparently cheap, lazy, doesn\u2019t believe in organizing fun time with his kids, and leaves all that to OP and her budget.\n\nHe\u2019s got at least two children from that first marriage with a lot of issues - both from his absences and his treating one child preferentially because the other(s?) were adopted rather than biologically his children.\n\nAt the beginning of their relationship, OP was financially dependent on him because she was still in nursing school.

She\u2019s very mouthy, thinks house rules do not apply to her, never cleans up after herself, and she is such a bully to her older sister. My best friend came from across the county to visit me and she was around my stepdaughter for 3 hours and was already irritated with her. That\u2019s how overwhelming she can be. My hubby turns a blind eye to her behavior because he just wants to be the \u201cfun\u201d dad. He feels like because they don\u2019t come over a lot, when they do it should be fun fun fun and no boundaries. I never really pushed the issue with her, when she\u2019s over I\u2019d just avoid her as much as possible for the sake of having peace. Her disrespect was never directed at me so I just left it alone or I\u2019d mention it to my hubby and he\u2019d just tell me she\u2019s just playing or she didn\u2019t mean it like that.  \nThis past weekend, apparently I sent her home crying because she tried to be disrespectful to me and I snapped back at her after holding it in for almost a year and basically told her she\u2019s not going to talk to me any kind of way and if she\u2019s going to come over she needs to learn how to be respectful like the rest of the children in the home. My oldest SD jumped in telling SD13 to stop being disrespectful and calm down and she went into her bully ways and yelling at her and just making a huge scene. So I put my foot down with hubby and told him, he needs to do his visitation her at her home for a while because I can\u2019t take another weekend of pure hell from her. Every week it gets worse because he won\u2019t correct her. We got a text from BM saying I made her cry and I was out of line for yelling at her and she doesn\u2019t want to come back over. In my head I\u2019m relieved I get a break from her and then the other side of my feels like TA for not walking away and letting her dad handle it but then again, his way of handling it is coddling her and telling her everything is going to be okay. Everyone else would be at fault but her.  \nIn a nutshell, the whole thing was over me not letting my SD17 drive them to Dunkin\u2019 Donuts at 8pm.

Don\u2019t create extra ones.", "YTA\n\n\nI'm going to go against the top comments are saying and let me explain why. \n\n\nYou say that your stepkids avoid going to your house. Why? There's a reason. Either you know what that reason is or your being deliberately ignorant and ignoring their feeling in favor of your own. This isn't normal for them to avoid spending time with you guys like this. They probably don't feel comfortable in your house. Do they have their own space when they visit? Are they forced to pack a bag for every single visit or do you have things for them? How well do you get along with them? I'll answer this for you from reading some of your other post: Nope. How are they supposed to feel comfortable in your home when they feel uncomfortable around YOU? \n\n\nMy step mom did a very similar things to me. Made some fun plans and when i avoided going to see them i found out later they went on a super fun trip. Sure I would totally put up with their BS for disnyland but im not up for being a maid/sitter/religious project on the regular. I didnt have a room, i had to pack up bags for every visit and would get guilt tripped the entire time. That's just scratching the surface btw, visits were a huge struggle for me because I was uncomfortable and emotionally exhausted the whole time. I cant say it's the same situation but clearly they aren't fond of visits.\n\n\nAnother thing i noticed was how you made sure to mention how YOU paid for everything. I would bet money that you mentioned how YOU pay and YOU plan everything multiple times to your step kids. You sound just like my stepmom. Well guess what??? YOUR HUSBAND PAYS FOR THIS ALSO AND THOSE ARE HIS KIDS. Do you remind your son of everything you buy for him?? Do you tell your husband that your sick of paying for your own child?? I GARANTEE that you have used this on those girls before. In fact I know you have because you mentioned something similar in a past post when you told your step daughter it's YOUR house. Do you tell your son that he's lucky you pay for HIM?? Do you remind your own son that he's a GUEST in YOUR home? Because that's what you told your daughters. I don't care if that's not what you meant because that's what they heard. \n\n\nI KNOW that your leaving other stuff out. There's no way that they avoid for no reason. There's a reason but you don't care enough to find out OR you're to busy feeling bad for yourself instead of children that have been forced into a very unfair situation. \n\n\nAlso I would like to add that I don't think you fully realize their situation. Imagine on half of your days off a relative of yours asks you come over and sit on their couch. They feed you and have a roof over your head but you just sit in their house for 2 days. I'm guessing your son has friends he can play with? Things in his room that are fun for him to do? Do you expect your son to sit around and do nothing?? SD's are older but they're still basically kids. They need things to do. Do you have some type of gaming system or literally anything they can do when they visit? Would you want to spend half your time not at work sitting in a relatives house twiddling your thumbs waiting to go home? They want to have fun. Fun doesn't always cost money but I'm sure you manage to have something for your own kid to do on the weekends. What about the girls?\n\n\nTLDR: OP needs to figure out why the girls are uncomfortable with them or at you their house. They should stop reminding kids how lucky they are to be dependent on OP for everything. Also OP needs to have something for girls to do since they aren't around friends. No one want to sit in a room doing nothing all weekend.", "Did you get married in the last month?

Will you join us?\u201d See no games in that.", ">it\u2019s not a game I\u2019m playing. Over the years I just got tired of feeling used.\n\nOP, what kind of mother are you??? They are LITERAL KIDS. They \"use\" their caregivers for safety and, ideally, fun. If they don't like coming to your place unless there's an outing, YOU are the problem, NOT the children.", "YTA. Everyone doesn't like that just show up and go in the car mess. Tell people what the plans are and let them decide for themselves", "Disneyland is worth getting fired over, hanging out at Dads house isn\u2019t. Like I get both sides so NAH but the part about telling her to request time off is irrelevant, most retail places have blackout periods and don\u2019t accept a time off request especially that weekend.", "YTA because: The kids MUST have a reason why they are not wanting to visit you and your husband. Kids aren't as clueless as some people like to think. I don't believe that they are doing this just to spite OP. If they were treated well all the time in OPs household then they would probably come over more. I'm pretty sure something else is up cus why would they have this grudge against going to OPs house if they were treated like the other kids? Imo the visitation agreement should probably be revisited if it's barely being followed. \n\nAlso, \"teaching them a lesson\" could be neccesairy in some cases but I also think that if you wanted to spend time with your step kids then you would be happy to spend time with them on any occasion, and on their terms. If they don't want to come that's fine but I think it's useless for you to punish them like that just because you think they should behave differently. If you want them to behave differently then there are probably other ways of communicating that. Again I think something else is fishy that needs to be talked about. \n\n I think it's a god thing OP is looking out for their own kids so that they get to have a good time with friends who want to celebrate the kids, not just because they want to go to Disneyland. The thing is though, this post doesn't seem to be about that. To me it just sounds like the reasoning for giving the tickets away was to be petty and teach a lesson to the step kids.", "YTA. I'm sorry, who are the parents and who are the kids here? Have you tried to develop a relationship with your step kids at all? What do they like, what are their interests? All I see is you resenting them for being kids and not automatically loving you like you think they should. And your edits make you look like a worse parent, not better.", "I think you\u2019re playing stupid games with teenagers. I don\u2019t like unstructured interactions and feel anxious just expected to sit around and \u201cspend time\u201d whatever that means. This is prob why they don\u2019t like you.", "\\> The only time they want to come over is when we\u2019re doing something or they want something. \n\nNewsflash.  Parents are tools for the needs of children.  Not the other way around. You're \\*\\*supposed\\*\\* to be a tool or a child's needs and growth.\n\nThis is narcissistic parenting you're engaged in.\n\nYTA", "Idk to me it seems like you don\u2019t get along with the step kids, so in order to make them jealous you intentionally didn\u2019t tell them the plans till after they said they weren\u2019t going. Because you didn\u2019t want them to be surprised by the pictures you\u2019d post? Either way they would have found out, but you telling them earlier than necessary tells me you had malicious intentions. YTA", "YTA.\n\nYea, the kids shouldn\u2019t use you for fun things, and I get the surface level of this argument. But they are CHILDREN who play out the attachments their ADULT parents formed with them. If their dad didn\u2019t form a loving bond in which they feel secure, they won\u2019t want to be around him. If he broke said bond (cheating or leaving their mom) they may feel betrayed. So while they can seem selfish, they are kids. You are the adult intentionally not seeing how this is your husbands fault, not theirs.", "INFO there's two sides to every story why exactly do they not want to spend time with them why do you feel the need to coax them?  The fact that you do that with your own kids sounds like they don't want to be around you either.  Because you \"wanted to teach a lesson\" cones off like you were intentionally vague just so you can rub it in their faces.", "YTA.\n\nIt's shouldn't matter why they choose to participate, it should only matter that they do and you all have the chance to bond. But it's not the bonding you're interested in it seems, it's more of a control issue.", "YTA. You enjoy enforcing \"conditions\" to get your step and bio kids to comply. \n\nYeah, I've read some of your posts and you are quite a manipulator.", "I agree, teens are busy and can have major responsibilities. My daughter (14) was in the school musical and that was a three month long commitment. It was the exact kind of situation where, she could not cancel her rehearsals or performances even if she wanted to for routine things. However a trip like Disney would possibly be a reason, coming along in this way since step parents have to juggle lots of schedules and may not even know in time to account for everyone else\u2019s, to let the understudy get their chance. That is a choice for the teen to make, which they couldn\u2019t do if you don\u2019t tell them.", "Gave them 2 months to prepare\u2026", "Oh shit! I would\u2019ve wanted to say \u201cI will be sure to never invite you again.\u201d But I\u2019m a blunt person. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", ">so likely she couldn\u2019t even ask for it off\n\nExcept for Disney she suddenly can make time. This is precisely OP's point - they don't care about their step siblings but about an expensive trip.", "Heavily doubt the 18 year old works 24 hours days. Maybe they had a plan to celebrate the birthday the time that day they could attend.", "Oh I did not know that. Is that in an update or a comment?? because that changes a lot for", "You do know that telling a child you\u2019re supposed to care for their not allowed in your home is kicking them out right? \n\nAlong with: op says the husband wasn\u2019t parenting when we have no idea what the husband was or wasn\u2019t doing.

Some places would just outright refuse it", "\u2764\ufe0f", "\"her husband wants to be the fun parent and won\u2019t discipline SD or tell her no\" \n\nThis would be a reason why SD would want to be there - gets everything she wants / gets to gave fun - not a reason SD does NOT want to be there.\n\nAll info we get on the bullying is OP saying younger SD bullies older SD, but what if older SD is just fawning enormously, trying to keep the peace, which looks to younger SD as if older SD is siding with the abusers? We can't possibly know, because we don't have (enough) info.\n\n\"then OP would be in the wrong however SD and Hubby would still suck too\"\n\nAbsolutly agree, hubby seems negligent at best, and I'm sure younger SD is no picknick especially at her age, just saying something must be going on to cause such irradic behaviour and it seems like it's more than what OP is describing in their posts."]}
