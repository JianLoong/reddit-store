I even texted their mother and made arrangements for my youngest SD14 and she act like she was on board with it. We have this ongoing issue with my step kids about them only coming over when we are doing something fun, every time we try to get them and just spend time with them at the house they make up every excuse in the book why they cannot come. \n\nI purposely did not tell them or my kids what the plans were this weekend. SD18 couldn\u2019t get off of work so I told her it\u2019s cool we will do something for her later on, no big deal in understand how it is working retail during the holidays. Today I texted their mother to confirm if SD14 were coming over tomorrow and she said SD14 had a long week and was really emotional and did not want to go to our house without her older sister (total BS, she doesn\u2019t even like her sister like that and she\u2019s been to our house plenty of times without her sister) just another excuse on why she cannot come. Mind you, it\u2019s my hubby court ordered weekend with her anyways. We don\u2019t make her come over so we just get her whenever she wants to come over. So I texted their mom back and said \u201cno big deal, we will do something else with them another time\u201d So SD18 texted me a little while ago asking what were doing and told her we are spending the weekend at Disney and another event. I told her so she wouldn\u2019t be surprised when photos are posted this weekend\n\nNow all of she wants to call out of work and my other SD14 wants to come without her sister now lol I told them \u201cI\u2019m sorry I gave the boys friends those tickets because y\u2019all didn\u2019t want to come over\u201d (I really did) so now they are pissed off and apart of me doesn\u2019t feel bad for SD14. SD18 is understandable because she actually has a good excuse but I do not want her calling out because she\u2019s on the verge of getting fired already for her attendance. Hubby wants to cave in and let her come but I don\u2019t want too because I\u2019m over her only wanting to see us when we\u2019re spending money on her. I want this too be a lesson to SD14 and he doesn\u2019t see it that way. I gave her an opportunity to come and she didn\u2019t want too sooooo\u2026..\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: before anyone says I\u2019m being unfair to my SK, I treat my BIO kids the same way.

It happens far too often when the parents get divorced.", "YTA The 18 year old I feel like she should have been told before you gave ticket away. She has a job.
