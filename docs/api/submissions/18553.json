So thus, still an accident.", "Exactly! The dead-man's switch key set-up is for a reason, and everyone involved is just lucky that only the sea-doo was damaged. It could have killed the nephew if it had gone over him. (less likely with a kill switch)", "Bil intended to deprive op of their rights to say who can use their property.", ">\"With permission\" would have changed the whole situation, yes.\n\nThe honest thing is to offer the cost of repairs even if one had permission.", "The comment is deleted. Please tell me what they said, because it was apparently the only comment that wasn't firmly behind OP on this one. I scrolled all the way down trying to find anyone on BIL's side just to see how out to lunch they were.", "The fact that it was being handled by someone without the owner's permission, much less the necessary training / license might render the insurance coverage null and void for the incident.\n\nInsurance companies love loopholes.", "He should've apologized and offered to pay to fix it in the first place right when it happened.", "If an inexperienced rider got on, there are so many bad things that can happen and result in a serious injury.", "Negligence is a good word for this situation.", "Or killed/seriously injured someone else. I doubt it's a private lake.", "...he didn't steal the Seadoo, he stole OP's *rights*? So you just wanna call it theft and you're working backwards from there, huh?\n\nBIL was obviously in the wrong here, and may indeed have violated *other* property-related laws, but if you're a guest at someone's house and use their Seadoo without their permission that isn't what theft is.\n\nIt also wouldn't be theft if BIL sat in OP's favorite chair after being asked not to, even if BIL broke it when getting up. Like...that's just not what theft is.", "Exactly. What kind of underwear stain of a human doesn't pay for property they damage?", "All you said was for it to be theft, there had to be intent to deprive. There was intent to deprive. So he stole the seadoo.", "If I take your car for a joy ride without permission, is that not stealing your car? I know sometimes with true legal jargon, definitions may differ a bit versus how the words are commonly used - theft may be one of those words, but taking something without permission is kinda what I understood \"theft\" or \"stealing\" to mean...\n\nI sorta understand where you're coming from though, but I'm not sure \"But I was a guest and just didn't get permission\" would hold up. I'm no lawyer though.", "Waaaaay too many of them.\n\nA lot of people have to learn a hard lesson not to loan anything out they mind being broken.", "Intent to deprive that person of their property. Not intent to deprive them of...\"their rights to say who can use their property.\"???? Look I get it you've got some weird thing where you can't take L's so you just double down over and over again. And it's charming, really, but theft has a legal definition and letting your son hop on your BIL's Seadoo isn't it.", "Funny you bring up joyriding, because joyriding actually *does* have a separate legal definition than theft, and specifically because joyriding does not include an intent to deprive. In many cases joyriders still get hit with GTA anyway, because good luck proving in court that you were gonna bring it back and you were \"just\" joyriding, but the situation here is flipped; good luck proving your nephew was riding your Seadoo on the lake your house is on with the intent to steal it from you and not just joyriding it."]}
