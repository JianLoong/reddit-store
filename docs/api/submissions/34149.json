Wendy and I get along well though we work in different fields and have our own groups of friends.\n\nI have an aunt on my mom\u2019s side, Anna (31f). Anna\u2019s mom, my mom\u2019s former stepmother, used to date Wendy\u2019s dad until he moved to another city. Anna has an extremely wealthy older husband (46m). She met him in high school when she babysat his niece. They dated when Anna graduated from college. They\u2019re now married with a son (3m) and Anna a SAHM since his birth.\n\nAnna lives a luxurious life and shares a lot on social media. I and Wendy are friends with her on several platforms but Wendy is jealous, there\u2019s no other word. She often talks about Anna and her husband age gap. She said it was creepy and there was no way she would date someone so much older.\n\nI always tried to get Wendy to stop but she would just bring the topic back again and again. \n\nThis Christmas our parents went abroad so I went to spend Christmas at my mom's side. My mom passed several years ago but it was nice to see the family. Wendy was set to spend Christmas with her friends but the host was busy last minute, so I invited Wendy to spend Christmas with me.\n\nThe day before Wendy and I headed back home, Anna and her family joined us. Anna\u2019s husband broke his ankle so he pretty much sat in a chair and just chatted with anyone who came to talk with him. Anna spent a good deal of time making sure he had food and drinks (meal was buffet style) and checked on him like every 10 minutes.\n\nWendy of course noticed this and kept whispering to me about how this was just a taste of Anna\u2019s future, having to wait hand and foot on her much older husband in his old age. Wendy said she wouldn\u2019t wish Anna\u2019s fate on her worst enemy. She said her husband has a devoted wife since he groomed her so well.\n\nI have had enough. Wendy was acting like the biggest Grinch with all her joy sucking gossips. So I purposefully raised my voice \u201cWendy, what do you mean grooming?! Just because they\u2019re 15 years apart doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s grooming involved!\u201d\n\nEveryone around us went quiet. Anna and her husband stared at us, knowing full well it involved them, but they didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nWendy was so embarrassed she excused herself and left the party. In the morning when we left, Wendy only said good bye to my grandma before heading out.\n\nWendy was angry and said I embarrassed her and drove her to her room without even getting dinner. She said I could have told her in private like I have always done and not shame her in public. She said it was normal for people to talk like this about every woman marrying a much older, richer man and Anna should know people say things like this behind her backs no matter what. I was just tired of her jealousy and hoped this would shut her up.

Good for you, standing up for Anna and putting an end to Wendy's bitching. \n\nIt must be exhausting to have to put up with her jealousy and at least now, even if she does want to bad mouth Anna, it won't be to you.", ">She said I could have told her in private like I have always done and not shame her in public.\n\nFunny, Wendy complained out loud about Anna & her husband at your mom side of the family gathering; which is technically out in public - all you did was say your response bit louder for the rest of the family can  hear. NTA, there a time & place to complain and be jealous without the person/object being there - Wendy fucked up by doing that around/in front of Anna & rest of family then have audacity to be upset at you when you rightfully stop hiding Wendy's bullshit in plain sight, in front of everyone that was right there in same room anyway.", "ESH. Yes, Wendy needs to stop talking about this. But what you did didn't just embarrass Wendy, it also will have embarrassed Anna and her husband. That was really unfair of you; they just became collateral damage here. You need to think about the impact on everyone before doing something like this.", "ESH. Wendy sucks for obvious reasons, but in your pursuit to punish Wendy all you did was make everyone else uncomfortable, including Anna and her husband. Had you handled it privately, they would have never known and could have enjoyed their Christmas. \n\nNext time don't invite Wendy to spend time with people she actively talks shit about", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have continued to talk about this with you especially if she knew it bothered you and it was way too bold to speak in public about it.\n\nBut you suck, too. Embarrassing her and making your family uncomfortable, especially during a time of celebration, was super out of line and is not going to fix any problems. If your Aunt went the rest of her life and was never in the know of mean crap she said, she would have went on blissfully and it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. This is super crappy and you might have damaged your relationship with her for a long time.", "YTA\n\nAnna met her 15 year older husband while she was in high school. Sure they dated after college but who really knows lol\n\nYou made everyone around you uncomfortable with that loud comment. You could have said anything else to ensure Wendy stops talking.", "Are we missing the part where they met while Anne was in highschool and started dating when she graduated college (which is what, early 20s)? Meaning the guy was 35 or so, dating somebody who is literally just learning about how life works.\n\nShe absolutely was groomed...\n\nYTA", "Your aunt was groomed though so Anna might be annoying but she isn\u2019t wrong", " ESH. You are major AH here - not for exposing Wendy, who was behaving shitty. But for making this visible to the people it concerned.

They were together 49 years when my dad passed last year. Noone even thought about their ages, it was just so clear that they were the love of each other's lives... there are genuine connections that actually bridge such a gape", "YTA. Not for making Wendy uncomfortable, but for making your aunt and uncle uncomfortable. There were many ways you could have dealt with this without hurting the people that you were trying to protect", "YTA. Your goal might have been to shame Wendy into shutting up, but you probably embarrassed Anna and her husband too. While she was annoying you could have asked/dragged her into another room for the conversation.", "YTA. It isn't everyone because if Wendy is justified in her criticism, making Anna and husband assholes, then you shouldn't attack her. If she isn't justified, then you made a scene, raising an offensive criticism of Anna and husband at a social event. In every scenario, though, you didn't embarrass only your target, but the people you claim to be defending. Who would invite you to a party in the future?", "You created an incident. I don't know if that makes you an asshole but I think there were other steps you could have taken before you made an embarrassing announcement to all parties.\n\n\"Anna. Stop. I don't want to hear another word about this. Especially here.\"", "NTA", "YTA. You know the history with Anna and her dad. Stop being dense. Wendy is a hater but that didn't mean you need to announce what she is saying to the whole room. There are other ways to shut her up... Maybe tell her afterwards that she was a buzz kill and why and that you'll never invite her again to your family's gatherings.", "NTA. For some people, talking about others behind their back is normal. That doesn't make it right. And by the way: if I hurt my foot I also wanted my partner to keep me company and make sure I have food and drink. That's a nice thing to do in a partnership. I'd do the same for my partner if the roles were reversed. But well, if someone wants to find something to get outraged about, they will.", "NO! NTA\n\n\n>She said it was normal for people to talk like this about every woman marrying a much older, richer man and Anna should know people say things like this behind her backs no matter what.\n\nIf that were the case then why does she feel embarrassed?\n\nNah, enough already.", "NTA.  Why do we infantilize grown women?  Let them make their own choices about partners.", "Maybe next time say something in private", "YTA- You could have privately told her to cut the shit. You made it awkward for Anna and her husband when you yelled that out. It would have been better to quietly tell Wendy to stop being jealous of the lifestyle Anna is afforded.", "NTA", "YTA\n\nWendy said those words to you in confidence. For all we know, she never talked about Anna like that except with you, someone who share history with Anna as well. You are Anna\u2019s niece, she was Anna\u2019s stepsister for a while. Anna is someone related to both of you.\n\nAnd the history of Anna and her husband is indeed a little alarming. I personally don\u2019t blame Wendy for feeling a little icky.\n\nYou kinda went nuclear on this, outing her on your family\u2019s turf where Wendy has no one. You also disrupted the party and definitely made Anna and her husband feel if not horrible then a little awkward at least.", "ESH. Wendy should not have been talking about it at a party but you didn\u2019t make anything better just weird and uncomfortable.", "NTA, and let Wendy know you're tired of hearing her complain about Anna and her husband, if you keep telling Wendy you think she's jealous of Anna maybe Wendy will finally stop talking about them to you. Also, it's NOT normal to talk about people behind their back.", "NTA, that was the absolute best thing you could\u2019ve done.", "Anna really goes to town about it but she isn't wrong. Wtf.", "[deleted]", "15 years isn't that huge an age gap imho, certainly not enough to fixate on", "Yta there was no need to create drama in front of everyone", "She should have been making nasty comments in private if she didnt want to be called out about it in public.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Talking to her in private clearly wasn't working and you were sick of her crazy gossip/comments from the peanut gallery.  From her later commentary it doesn't sound like she's learned though.", "NTA BUT you Also made it awkward for them bringing it up. Also there age difference is nothing. When you\u2019re older there\u2019s not much difference anymore", "NTA - it's 15 years ffs. It's not like it's 50 or 60 years as a gap and she's trying to get his cash. \n\nWhen Anna is 40 he'll be 55. When Anna is 50 he'll be 65. When Anna is 70 he'll be 85. Those are all perfectly similar ages to be old together.", "NTA. If talking to Wendy in private made even the slightest bit of difference, you wouldn't have been in this situation. You've tried before and she doubles down every time. Embarrassing her is the only way to get her to knock it off. She can judge all she wants but you've made it clear you want no part of it and don't want to hear it but she doesn't care. You did the right thing, even if it made things awkward for her. Maybe now she'll think before she runs her mouth.", "I think OP should talk to her cousin and clarify that she was tired of Wendy's talking behind her back and was just trying to embarrass her but maybe she didn't think it through.", "Agree ESH. In your pursuit of trying to teach Wendy a lesson, you have hurt/embarrassed two innocent people. Although you had spoken to Wendy in the past, you could have been firmer this time and let her know, in private, that it's unacceptable to you and in future you will walk away if she starts to gossip about Anna and her husband.", "I feel negligent for not considering Anna and her husband\u2019s position in any of this-  until I saw  this comment. Really good to point out.", "She tried talking to Wendy privately but that clearly wasn't working. I agree with her approach because maybe now Wendy will think twice before saying stuff she shouldn't be.", "So I assume you are against being able to vote or join the military once you turn 18.", "My thoughts too, are we pretending she's wrong...? xD  If a person even considers dating somebody 15 year younger, WHILE SHE WAS IN HIGHSCHOOL (meaning he was 30+) there's a good reason, and \" but she is so mature for her age\" is not one of them.", "Did you miss the part of \u201cthey dated when she graduated college\u201d as in when she was at least 22 years old?", "If you think that Wendy was behaving shitty, why aren\u2019t you voting ESH?", "You are nta by the way", "Did you miss the part where she continuously tried to talk to her privately before??", "\"She said I could have told her in private *like I have always done* and not shame her in public.\"\n\nIt's in the post man...", "It\u2019s concerning when realise that Anna was 16/17yo when she met her husband 30/31 while being a babysitter for his niece.", "At 30 and 45 no. But when you meet an actual child and groom them until they\u2019re in their 20s then yeah. 20 and 35 is a massive gap. There\u2019s absolutely nothing a 20 and 35 year old have in common", "I think people are just icked out because she was his nieces babysitter before she became his wife so he knew his wife as a child.", "OP did tell Wendy numerous times in private  before the  family gathering to stop doing that, which Wendy herself admitted OP did. Except this time, Wendy was doing this in front of OP's mom side of the family at a gathering, instead of far away at home where it just OP & Wendy. OP didn't screw up in this situation, Wendy did by forgetting or being entitled of where she was at - Anna and/or other family member(s) was going to hear what Wendy was saying, one way or the other at the gathering, all because Wendy wouldn't STFU for her sake; let alone OP /Anna /anyone else there.", "Yeah, and made the people she claims to be defending embarrassed at the party. OP is definitely TA.", "Being groomed is not a choice", "he would\u2019ve been 30 when she was 15.. so??\n\nETA: if she babysat in high school she was likely between 14-17 at the start which makes that so gross and weird to be married to that same person by 22-23", "She wasn't in high school though, they only started dating when she graduated college.", "Except, he met her when she was probably a 16/17 high school kid when he was 30/31, when she was babysitting his niece; he clearly had time to groom her.", "You are right. Updated to reflect that", "Yes, a 33-35 year old man started dating a 22-24 year old girl (I'm not from US, idk when you graduate), MUCH better...", "Or they ended up Facebook friends due to suggested contacts a few years later \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Maybe they ran into each other in a bar, were set up on a blind date, one of them walked into the other\u2019s place of work/business etc. Plenty of other possibilities could have happened. Making baseless assumptions then judging people based on these baseless assumptions is ridiculous.", "\u201cHad time to do so\u201d doesn\u2019t mean he did, but yes the possibility certainly exists."]}
