I come from an Asian family. In our culture, as both a boy and as an older sibling, it is my duty to sacrifice my time, my wants, my needs, for the needs of my younger siblings. This meant that from the moment she was born, the earth revolved around my younger sister. Growing up there were plenty of things I would have loved to do but couldn\u2019t, examples. learning instruments, free after school clubs, sleepovers, school trips, all of which she got to do. \r  \n\r  \nBecause my she has been spoiled, even as a fully grown adult my sister is something of a brat. She throws tantrums and sulks when she doesn't get her way and is selfish with her things. She does next to nothing around the house or for our dogs. She rarely cooks or cleans. Refuses to housekeep or contribute because she is \u201ctired and stressed.\u201d Until earlier this year, she payed nothing towards this house, she still would be paying nothing into the house if I hadn't refused to go back to carrying the mortgage for my family. I still pay over double.\r  \n\r  \nRecently our parents decided that redecorate everything. My parents reminded me that I have a large room while my sister has a much smaller room and therefore much less space. They asked me if I would be willing to give her my room. I refused. My mother then said I hadn\u2019t considered it. I cut her off, saying I didn't need to consider because I have in the past and would have offered to do so if I wanted to and walked away. I spent the rest of the day in a low mood, because I felt that again they were putting her needs before my own. All three of them agree that the reason she needs the space is because she is a girl and girls need more room. I think that her gender is irrelevant because its my space and I pay for it.\r  \n\r  \nThe day after, my sister and I were continuing to rip out the house. She came across some games that she doesn't use but I still do. She asked me if I wanted to keep them or sell them since we could make a lot of money. I said that I use them and that if she wanted to she could sell the sealed things but to leave the ones open since I still get enjoyment out of them. She then got very passive aggressive, accusing me of lying to her and hoarding things. I told her not to ask me for help if she wasn\u2019t going to listen to what I said. She replied \"I could be a real b\\*tch about this you know, because you're the reason that I'm stuck in that room! I know you're feeling guilty about it because you just sat there and did nothing but be sad yesterday.\" I told her that I'm not obligated to do that, and that I was sad the day before because of how my parents made me feel and not everything was about her. She started to scream in my face. I told her she could go f\\*ck herself if that's how she was going to and she stormed off to her room and immediately began facetiming her friend and cussing me out over it.

In turn, they take care of the younger ones.\n\nYeah it's obviously a big continent with a lot of cultures, but that description rings true. Being older means you hold more responsibility, and yes, are sometimes expected to sacrifice for the younger one, get hit without hitting back, and generally be the bigger man. But the flip side of that is you are afforded more respect and the younger one is expected to listen to you, defer to your judgement, and generally follow where you lead. And that goes double for an older brother/younger sister. \n\nThat is to say, it's a two-way street.
