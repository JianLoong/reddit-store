I have no skin in their game, no attachment to them. I wanted to spare him a little, but I always kept him in the loop and talked him thru my perspective. We always handled things in mutual agreement. His opinion of his parents did change - the death of ego, if you will. He saw them for who they were to others, rather than how he idolized them as a child. It was heartbreaking: I felt responsible for damaging their relationship.
