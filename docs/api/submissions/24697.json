I thought it would help if they knew each other better before living together. However, my daughter isn't interested and often avoids these opportunities. I want us all to be a family, but my daughter feels like I'm ignoring her emotions and pushing her into this. She believes I'm prioritizing my girlfriend over her and not understanding how she feels. \n\nI spoke to my sister about it for an outside perspective and she told me I should give my daughter some space and to not push her to meet my gf right now, but I feel like I've already given her enough space and time these past few years.

As long the new member of the household is not treating your daughter bad and your daughter is not expected to have any kind of relationship with your gf or has to sacrifice room/stuff for her, the gf is a roommate to her - and if you are living under someone else roof it can happen you get new roommates. No employee will get rid of your coworkers bc you don't like them, no landlord will decline a possible renter for a shared apartment bc the other renters don't like them. \n\nAnyway, trying to force a relationship between your gf and daughter will not work, bc its forced. Just sit your daughter down, tell her its absolutly fine she sees your gf as a roommate. Your gf will not take over any parental responsibilities and you will stay her only parent. You don't expect her to have any sort of relationship with your gf and you can promise her your gf will not try to push for any relationship either, if your daughter doesn't want to. She will not have to sacrifice anything she has now, including alone time with you. But you expect her to be cordial with your gf and you expect the same from your gf - if this isn't the case, privileges will be taken away, bc thats the same you would expect from her for every person who potentially moves in. Like should you open your house to a refugee or relative your daughter doesn't know well, the expectation would be the same. \n\nAnd then make sure you keep your word.

Feeling it in your body if you spend the day doing something physical.  Nor am I talking about health insurance.  I too live in a country with excellent free healthcare.  It\u2019s the idea of, \u201cwhat if I can\u2019t work?\u201d  You will need to start thinking about extended benefits or some kind of safety net.\n\nIf you think what you felt about retirement is going to be the same at 45 as 25, then I\u2019m going to say you are lucky and probably hitting your saving goals each year.  That\u2019d great.  However, it\u2019s vastly different to be saving thinking you have 45 years versus 20 versus 5.  Way more pressure as you get older, especially if you get a finance hit at some point.  Much easier to recover at 30 than 45.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s not about finding someone interesting or wanting the same things.  It\u2019s about the approach.\n\nEnjoy your thirties, it\u2019s a fantastic time.  There a bit of overlap with people younger and older.  Once you get into your forties, you are going to see the age gap at play between yourself and people in their twenties."]}
