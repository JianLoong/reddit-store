I thought it would help if they knew each other better before living together. However, my daughter isn't interested and often avoids these opportunities. I want us all to be a family, but my daughter feels like I'm ignoring her emotions and pushing her into this. She believes I'm prioritizing my girlfriend over her and not understanding how she feels. \n\nI spoke to my sister about it for an outside perspective and she told me I should give my daughter some space and to not push her to meet my gf right now, but I feel like I've already given her enough space and time these past few years.

If she's not over it, you better respect that unless you want to ruin your relationship with her.  \n\nAnd my dude... as others have pointed out, there are more years between you and your gf than your gf and your daughter; your daughter being almost that full age gap in age herself... not necessarily saying love is impossible, but it's a wee bit creepy.", "Yta", "YTA. Accept that your daughter will never see your gf as a 'mom' since your gf is only 10 years older than your daughter (i.e. in the older sister age range, not the mom age range).

This is a great way to ensure your daughter cuts you out of your life as soon as she has the opportunity.

If you plan a long term relationship with her, waiting another few years shouldn't matter in the grand scheme. This would most likely avoid a lot of problems. \n\nI don't judge you, bc other than the i guess mostly american redditors here i don't think you should let your kids control/dictate your life - and dating is a part of life. Its different with small kids, but teenagers and older should be able to act at least cordial to other people and should have already learnt that sometimes you just have to suck up if you don't like someone but can't get away at the moment (like if a relative in needs you don't like is moved into the household or a new partner of a parent). As long the new member of the household is not treating your daughter bad and your daughter is not expected to have any kind of relationship with your gf or has to sacrifice room/stuff for her, the gf is a roommate to her - and if you are living under someone else roof it can happen you get new roommates. No employee will get rid of your coworkers bc you don't like them, no landlord will decline a possible renter for a shared apartment bc the other renters don't like them. \n\nAnyway, trying to force a relationship between your gf and daughter will not work, bc its forced. Just sit your daughter down, tell her its absolutly fine she sees your gf as a roommate. Your gf will not take over any parental responsibilities and you will stay her only parent. You don't expect her to have any sort of relationship with your gf and you can promise her your gf will not try to push for any relationship either, if your daughter doesn't want to. She will not have to sacrifice anything she has now, including alone time with you. But you expect her to be cordial with your gf and you expect the same from your gf - if this isn't the case, privileges will be taken away, bc thats the same you would expect from her for every person who potentially moves in. Like should you open your house to a refugee or relative your daughter doesn't know well, the expectation would be the same. \n\nAnd then make sure you keep your word. No pushing for more than being cordial, no parental responsibilities for your gf, no downpriorising of father daughter time bc of your gf, just being fair. And most important, be sure your gf is on board and doesn't expect to be able to order your daughter around or demand anything from her.\n\nIts the first bigger change for your daughters livingsituation since her mom died, cut her some slack she isn't excited. But she is at an age where major changes gonna happen anyway soon, so its not bad she gets used to it. If she is not gonna like her roommate when she starts college, she already has the experience how to handle the situation. \n\nBut i would still say its better to wait a few years - bc you shouldn't underestimate that you are gonna be the middleman who has to deal with every complaint from both parties and still have to make sure your daughter doesn't get less attention bc there is someone else around.", "YTA.\n\nYour first priority should be your child.

There have certainly been ups and downs integrating her into the family, but they stem from words she says and actions she takes, not how old she is.
