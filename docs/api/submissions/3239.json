When I was in university I became friends with a girl who came out and began dating women in Canada but tried to hide it from her family who is from a very traditional country. Someone posted a photo of her and her gf at the time kissing and her family found out and disowned her. She didn\u2019t have money and wasn\u2019t allowed to work over a set number of hours due to being an international student and her fees were much higher and she couldn\u2019t get loans for them. So if she couldn\u2019t continue her studies she might have to go home where she might be killed for being gay. \n\nShe asked me for help and we went online and figured out if we married she would be safe and could work and study as normal and would get lower university fees. I was young and didn\u2019t really think about my future and just wanted to help a friend so we got a marriage certificate and moved in together. She worked and studied and so did I for 2 more years until we both graduated. We left for different cities for work and formally divorced 3 years later. I consider her a good friend and she helped me a lot with my sister when she was having issues with a landlord (they are in the same city). Of course she is very scared and begged me never to say anything to anyone about our fake marriage because it illegal. \n\nI only told my fianc\u00e9 now because we are going to get married next summer and I think he should know but I never told my exs. I don\u2019t want to tell someone if there\u2019s even a chance we could breakup because what if he says something in revenge? I wanted to wait until the statute of limitations ended in 10 years but that\u2019s still a year away and he should know before marriage. I thought he would be supportive and understanding about it because he seems to be ok with LGBT issues but he got really mad and said it was a massive issue and now he can\u2019t get it out of his head I might me gay. I told him I\u2019ve never been with a girl and I\u2019m definitely straight and he said I couldn\u2019t be sure and I could leave him for a woman. He also said he wouldn\u2019t have dated me knowing I was a divorcee and I don\u2019t feel like I am but I guess technically I am.

Turning it into you're secretly gay and will leave him for a woman is extreme.  Had you been married to a man, I doubt he would be saying you're secretly straight and plan to leave him for another man.  There is some homophobia going on with him.", "NTA.  You thought you could share this info with him. You were wrong. You were married for 5 years so stop fretting about it being a sham, though. Time to move on.

I'm having a hard time understanding why you waited so long to share this with your fiance. But I also think his reaction to this is weird. Nothing about this made me think you were in a romantic relationship. But there's a reason he thinks that. I think this is best sorted out in couples therapy.", "NTA at all.

But the reason for it was rather nice, though illegal.\n\nBut your fiance is an AH for the way he freaked out over it. I expected him to be mad, but freaking out about whether or not you could leave him for another woman? Very homophobic and reeks of massive insecurity.", "YTA \n\nMajor thing to keep hidden. \n\nAlso if your concerned you were in a fraudulent marriage that you didn't want to tell your fiancee.

I feel like once you start talking about marriage, there shouldn't be any secrets (you don't have to spill your guts to someone you are dating, but if you are planning to marry, your spouse has a right to know everything- in my opinion) so it depends on when you told him.

You should not have accepted his proposal until this was shared.

He's having an honest reaction to your keeping *that kind* of secret from him. In his mind (and mine) you were dishonest about the whole thing - and how could he ever trust you to tell the truth? What else could you be hiding? I don't know how you recover from that kind of breach of trust!\n\nHis homophobia makes me want to say E S H but your dishonesty overrides that...", "Yta\n\nYou kept a pretty significant secret and he is questioning it.

A previous marriage might have implications, so of course you needed to tell him.  But I totally understand your reasons for delaying, of being concerned that it would be used against you both.\n\nBut him focusing on fearing you may be gay, is so wrong.  He is not trusting you, and so what if you are bi?  It's a previous relationship which is over, regardless.  And if he fears you cheating, firstly he shouldn't be marrying you, and secondly you could just as easily cheat with a man.\n\nIf he has issues with fraud or lawbreaking that's one thing, but his concerns just sort of prove why you didn't disclose this before.", "ESH as well meaning as you were, that really is a big thing to leave until you\u2019re engaged. However, your fianc\u00e9 seems like a real piece of work, and quite honestly you may have lucked out. He seems to think you\u2019re some how less than by being a divorcee, and moreover the acrobatics he is doing to demonstrate precisely how insecure he is because you could \u201cleave him for a woman\u201d is astound him.", "NTA - your fiance seems incredibly insecure. Hopefully he calms down and listens to send accepts what you have to say about it.", "Tough call for me. Info: How long have you been engaged?", "YTA.\n\nLook, I think you are a nice person to want to help a friend and understand why you have a hard time trusting people with this information. It was very noble of you. \n\nHowever, I did not propose to you. You did not accept my proposal. You didn\u2019t lie and withhold information to me. You did not break my trust and make me question everything about you. You did all of this to your fianc\u00e9 and he has a right to be upset about this for several reasons:\n\n1. You lied to him. He thinks you are deceptive. What else might you be lying to him about?\n\n2. What you did- morally right or wrong to me- is illegal. You have been living with this secret and fear of getting found out by the authorities and now have also put this burden on to him. \n\n3. He only has your word that this was not a love marriage but your word has lost its value now. Ultimately, I\u2019d argue it doesn\u2019t matter if you were in a loving relationship with your friend or not and that his reaction seems homophobic, however, he has a right to know and trust the person he has been with for 4 years and you should have told him before you accepted his proposal so he had all the information and could commit on his own terms, not based on a false idea he has of you. \n\n4. If he rejected you knowing this about you, he is not the one for you and the marriage would never last anyway because your core values do not align.\n\nSo you are the arsehole for not telling him before agreeing to marrying him.", "NTA I can understand your reason for not mentioning it before now. It doesn't really affect your current life and if he ever decided to be vindictive, it could ruin your life and someone else's. Sure, it was illegal, but I think preventing someone from having to go back to a family/country that could lead to her death serves the greater good, any benefits you got from that defrauding would be minimal.\n\nBut, his reaction is interesting. I don't feel comfortable saying he's not an asshole since he seems to be blowing this out of proportion,, but I don't necessarily think he is one either (I almost went with N A H). I could see him being mad about the illegality or even for keeping such a massive secret for years (even with valid reason). But for him to turn it into a \"this means you are secretly gay\" issue is absurd. It might take some talking to find out why that's where he immediately went and if it is latent homophobia or if he is confused about the situation where he's mad about the secret but also not sure he thinks it's bad and so is deciding to be mad about the fact it was to a woman.", "YTA", "YTA", "ESH, he does have the right to know before getting married which you did tell him but I feel you waited a bit longer than you should have. I can see how he feels like he was tricked but people don't tell everyone their secrets right away. You didn't do anything wrong as you helped your friend (even though it's illegal) and you wanted to protect yourself and your friend. How can he ever know that you aren't bi and had some sexual relations with her? This is tough, go to therapy.", "Yta. You committed fraud.

She chose to withhold her crime.\n\nHis reaction that he's upset that his fianc\u00e9e committed a crime that he could be implicated in and refused to tell him tells us that he's extremely normal because that is an extremely normal reaction to have.", "Eh, if you get married and have a kid and then your wife is suddenly in trouble with the law, that impacts you. $$ to hire a lawyer, $$ to pay fines, lost income if she becomes unable to find a job as a felon, maybe jail time leaving you to single parent a kid (I have no idea if jail time for this kind of fraud is a thing).", "He could get in trouble if he is knowingly covering up a crime. Although it's unlikely they would actually charge him\n\nPlus I'm not sure everyone is comfortable with marrying someone that could potentially get arrested", "... 4 years into a very serious relationship when they were already engaged.  I meant she should have said something sooner.  About being married before, at least, if not the fake-marriage part.", "I hope after statue of limitations in all relevant jurisdictions has passed", "\u270d\ufe0f", "They could have googled to see if she was married without her telling them she was married before. I bet OP's soon to be ex googles all his future gfs.", "He doesn\u2019t seem to be upset she committed a crime. He seems to be upset *that she might be gay*. She isn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t have a problem.\n\nYou are making up up an objection he doesn\u2019t appear to have.\n\nHe cannot currently be implicated in her crime, no. He does have the power, however, to get her in legal trouble, and to get her friend killed, putting them in way more of a vulnerable position that him right now. They are essentially at his mercy.", "How on earth would this man be implicated in her \u201ccrime\u201d lmao", "Yeah, but\u2026 they aren\u2019t married, and if he doesn\u2019t want to get married to a criminal, there is plenty of time to back out; any legal issues he may have he has the chance to take on willingly, or not. She didn\u2019t *get him into legal trouble*.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t seem to be his issue, however. He seems to be hung up on being engaged to someone *who might be gay* and *who is a divorc\u00e9e*.", "Serious relationships don\u2019t start out serious necessarily.\n\nI suppose I\u2019d change my opinion slightly if I discovered they had been engaged for years. I was under the impression that they were newly engaged, or had been engaged for only a few months, perhaps, and that she was disclosing now because she felt an engagement was the appropriate level of seriousness to disclose. Considering the risk to her friend, she obviously can\u2019t just tell boyfriends willy nilly.", "Why is the guy not allowed to show some feelings? I feel like he has the right to be mad. I\u2019m sure he feels betrayed.", "To be clear, OP is not disclosing her previous marital status to protect someone from being deported. We've established that these things are easily searched so telling *every* possible long term partner about her previous marriage would put her friend in exponentially increasing danger. She waited until she thought she would spend her life with this man, that was right.", "You\u2019re so correct! People don\u2019t seem to understand the logic. \ud83d\ude44"]}
