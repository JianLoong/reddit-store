She found him fooling around with another girl and called off the wedding. It\u2019s a huge mess and I feel awful for her. It truly is a devastating time for her and I\u2019ve been as supportive as possible through it all. \n\nShe has been one of my closest friends for the past 15ish years and she is basically a sister to me. Because of this, when I found out they were engaged at the beginning of the year, I wanted to give her a truly special wedding gift. She has always been into interior designing and has wanted an Eames lounge chair for a long time. I found one for $4500, which was a good deal, so I got it for her. Im fortunate to be able to afford this, but it\u2019s still quite a lot. She was ugly crying when I told her about it and she was extremely grateful for it. However, now that the wedding is called off, I\u2019m not sure what to do. I could still use that money if I were to get it back\u2026\n\nIs it rude to ask for her to return it or at least pay me back for the chair? I feel like I would be such an asshole for doing so, but some other friends (who aren\u2019t close to her) said she absolutely should at least return it so I can get my money back. She\u2019s going through a lot now, so I don\u2019t want to press her too much and honestly if I never see the money again, that\u2019s fine. But still, $4500 is a good amount of change that I would be happy to have if possible.\n\nEdit: thanks for all the replies so far. I realized I left out a very important detail which is the time frame to return the chair is 90 days, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking this question now. I bought the chair in mid September, so that to return and get the full refund is coming up in about a month. \n\nTo address some other comments, you all are right about asking about just asking her for money, which is dumb and I will not do that. The big reason why I even asked the question was due to my conversation with other friends who said she should return it. \n\nUltimately, I will not ask her to do anything and she can keep the chair, no problem. If she does get married again tho\u2026 maybe I\u2019ll just buy her some nice chocolate then lol. Thanks everyone!

However you might want to choose your moment with care and tact.\n\nNAH though.", "On paper, no you wouldn\u2019t be the AH for asking for your wedding gift back if they didn\u2019t go through with the wedding. Social protocol dictates she give it back. \n\nBut there\u2019s technicality, and then reality. \n\n1. The expectation is for HER to give the gifts back, not for YOU to demand them back. Let your friend have the dignity to offer to do the right thing on her own.  \n\n2. Your friend just had her heart stomped on, is it really the best time to ask for your gift back? Give her time to process the enormity of what happened. \n\n3. You said she likes interior design, it sounds like you bought it for her. Not because she ended up with this specific guy. For me that changes the dynamic of letting her keep it. \n\n4. At its root, wedding gifts are a way to show our friends support. Why, as a society, is it normal to drop a huge sum celebrating someone\u2019s happiness, but not comforting someone when they are experiencing huge loss and sadness? Idk, it just seems like if you were okay spending that amount of money on this friend it shouldn\u2019t matter if it was originally given in the context of celebrating their wedding.\n\nIf it were me, I\u2019d let her keep the chair because adult friendships are worth their weight in gold and I wouldn\u2019t want to add further insult to injury by asking for my gift back.

I can see in the case of a family heirloom engagement ring where the other person is the one to break the engagement that you could expect them to give it back but that\u2019s the only circumstance I can really see an expectation of giving the gift back being reasonable. Yea, it is wedding etiquette to give gifts back if the wedding is called off but the gift giver shouldn\u2019t really expect that or ask for it.", "I think YWBTA. It sounds like that chair was really a gift to *her* under the guise of the wedding, and not a gift to the couple. I think that's kind of an important distinction - it feels less like her returning a gift they recieved to start their life together, and more like her returning a gift she recieved personally from a friend. \n\nNormal etiquette aside, I think this would also feel a bit too much like kicking someone when they're down. I would just eat the money. In the future, this is probably a good idea why you shouldn't tell someone about a gift before you actually give it.", "I\u2019m going to say YWBTA only cause the wedding got broken off because her fianc\u00e9 cheated and this really kicking her while she\u2019s down.

Also I was very unaware with this wedding \u201cetiquete.\u201d If you give a gift before the wedding happens you already gave the gift. And in my mind a gift is a gift is a gift. Full stop.

She wasn't at fault and just had her heart stomped on. For you to then rescind a fantastic gift that you were comfortable giving beforehand seems cruel. Like, if I were her I'd play it cool but I'd be so hurt: my entire world is falling apart because who I thought I would be married to for the rest of my life cheated on me and my best friend at this time just asked for the chair back. I'd be quite salty about it, probably for a long while. I don't think it's worth it OP, you were willing to give it up beforehand. I know it's wedding etiquette to return gifts but her mind is probably all over the place, and every returned gift means another phone call, text, message from ANOTHER person she has to call and relive the trauma with...eek.

Never mind the fact that the marriage didnt happen because groom couldn't keep his tallywhacker outta other women.\"\n\nIf you were my friend and started trying to coerce me into shit like this right after the day I was supposed to be getting married, youd find yourself an ex friend and blocked on all platforms.", "Omg what awful people you all are, it\u2019s money you already spent to share a happy moment with a friend, why wouldn\u2019t you support her on her saddest moment? It\u2019s money that you already spent!!", "I don't know... the chair was given BEFORE the wedding so to me I wouldn't consider it a wedding gift. A chair isn't exactly a standard wedding gift item, and really one should never, ever give a gift one cannot afford. Unfortunately I think OP put themselves into a corner with regards to the timing and it is very unlikely she could ask for this back without it being considered a stab in the gut that will end the friendship. Is there a way to ask - sure. But OP needs to be willing to risk the friendship over the cost, and it is up to them whether it's an acceptable price.", "I doubt many other gifts were given in advance of the wedding\u2026", "Brilliant idea.  The only thing I'd change is the 'if you need help' bit. Enlist a few other friends, pick a Saturday in a few weeks and let her know that you're coming over to help her deal with all of that. She'll likely be relieved, and on the very off chance that she either didn't know the etiquette or was planning to ignore it, that won't be an issue.", "This would be the perfect perfect avenue to take. It will absolutely work, and not come off inconsiderate or tacky, as long as she had already received several other gifts before the wedding as well.", "you\u2019re a magician of words. what an excellent way to be supportive and bring the topic up", "This is the perfect way to phrase it.  It's assuming that she will do what she is supposed to and offering her help with it.", "Well said.", "I think even this would be an upsetting and borderline untactful thing to say.  I MIGHT at most say,  \"I am so sorry things didn't work out.  It's small comfort,  I'm sure,  but if you choose to keep the chair,  we can consider that either your next few birthdays and Christmases or another major event present,  if and when.  I couldn't afford to spluge like that often,  but I'd be happy if the chair at least was supportive and comfortable at a time like this!\"", "This is where I\u2019m stuck. For me, the gift giving is about seeing the reaction of the person receiving it. Especially for a gift like that. She gave it to the friend to start a new life. It\u2019s not her choice that she didn\u2019t marry a cheater. Let her enjoy the lounge chair in her new single life because you care about her. \n\nAlso, a gift is a gift. Once you give it. It\u2019s just not yours anymore and it is rude to ask for something that is NOT YOURS.", "\ud83d\udcaf", "But that leads me to the question, why was the gift gifted before the actual wedding day? Its not common where im from, to gift anything before the date.", "i disagree, If i gave a friend a wedding gift, and it turned out her husband to be had cheated on her, the last thing i'd be doing is asking for the gift back. Especially an expensive chair. What i'd be doing is asking where shes going to be living on her own and where she like that expensive chair put in her new, cheater free home. And how can i help to make it happen.", "Yes I agree. But it's also reasonable for it to take time for the split couple to return the gifts. 3 weeks is starting to push it, but if there are a lot to mail back or legal things for the ex-couple to attend to (like moving out and such) it could maybe take longer.", "It's worded more along the lines of we will bring it over next time we visit. Sometimes if the visit is going yo be awhile I will send by registered post where they have to sign for it so I will check delivery times to send it at their convenience (SAHM so it's easy for me to send anytime).", "They don't have to do that because everyone who we have done this with knows I'm the person to stress over stuff until it's done.", "Yeah this is some George Costanza level stuff", "exactly this. The groom-to-be cheated, blew up the friend's life, and now all of the physical and emotional labor falls to the friend to clean up the mess. It would absolutely feel like the friend is being personally punished for the groom's cheating by having her dream chair from her best friend taken back.", "I don\u2019t have many friends and maybe this is why, but I would write someone off completely for this, just for kicking me while I\u2019m down and also for not supporting me and understanding that I didn\u2019t choose to be cheated on.", "I still don't think it's appropriate to ask about it right now, its been 3 weeks and this girls life is quite literally crumbling all around her. She needs support not \"hey sorry you're not getting married anymore, but it's standard etiquette to return gifts and the return window is coming up so, can I have that chair back?\" OP's a close friend (\"she's like a sister\") too, I would definitely be reconsidering the  friendship if one of my close friends was concerned about getting a couch refunded while I was having to deal with a cheating fiance and calling off a wedding. \n\nOP should either entirely cop the loss if it's not given back at all, or just resell the couch for the price she bought it at (since she got it discounted from the full price). Also kind of a dumb move to gift someone something substantial if you're not comfortable with forever parting with that money.", "If I\u2019m not mistaken, OP purchased the chair at the beginning of the year when they announced their engagement, so we\u2019re already well past the return window.", "I'm sure it varies state by state in the US but I think it's considered a contract unless given on a holiday on which gifts are typically exchanged. Then it gets a little murky as to whether it must be returned or not.", "Of course you don\u2019t get wedding gifts back from divorced couples - they got married. \n\nWhat if you got someone a graduation gift (a briefcase or something similar) and then you found out that they dropped out of college a couple of months before graduation and never actually finished school? Should that person keep the graduation gift?", "Unless her friend is oblivious, she'll see right through that bs. Don't gift someone something if you're going to want it back.", "A lot of people get it delivered directly to the house, too so people don\u2019t have to transport them. Especially for larger gifts.", "So if the wedding is cancelled after the shower, the gifts have likely already been used so you wouldn\u2019t expect them back? And they\u2019re for the bride not really the wedding. \n\nBut if you give money and the wedding is cancelled I would definitely expect it back.", "Ah ok that would be really strange where I am. Wedding gifts are given on the day. The benefit is there\u2019s no drama if the wedding is called off.", "That's a hard one to comment on but lets say I buy a gift for a couple and they divorce in one month. I honestly might ask for that gift back, depending on what it is and why they separated. If it was my friends fault \\[assuming only one half of the couple is my personal friend\\] then I would *absolutely* want the gift back.", "Yeah all the comments I\u2019ve read suggesting that are making me cringe so badly.

Maybe you need a snickers.", "The way I read it, the gift was given well before the wedding. So it's more of an engagement gift.\n\nEven if it's a combo gift, I still think asking for it back is poor taste.", "Now that is a good way to put it. Me being a petty mare, I'd add something along the lines of, \"Maybe those gifts will remind you of bad times, so returning them might be good for you.\" I mean, they actually might remind her of bad times, to be honest. But, if she said she wanted to keep the chair but return the food mixer and granny-style china, I'd let her keep it. I'm not *that* evil.", "Returning the chair and taking her on a girls weekend would be a really nice thing for both of them. OP can get some of the money back and her friend can get some use out of the wedding gift without the constant visual reminder.", "Oooh or suggest to return the chair and you both go on vacation with the money.", "\"now that it's clear nobody will ever love you can i just get that chair back real quick?\"", "Yeah rn is not the time", "\u201cYes I know he\u2019s terrible. Don\u2019t get your tears on the Eames!\u201d \n\nI\u2019d want to return the gift also, but damn the timing would suck all around.", "Groom did the damage, groom should be the one to deal with it.", "Fr. I was surprised how many upvotes that comment got.", "you would be a terrible friend to not return a $4500 gift when the event it's for didn't occur. but agree the way the parent comment put it is tactless", "I agree.  When someone gives a gift, they need to be comfortable with an amount they are spending.  I hope op does not ask for it back.   While it would be nice if the bride returned the gifts, she is probably so heartbroken right now it is the last thing on her mind.", "\"the chair was given BEFORE the wedding so to me I wouldn't consider it a wedding gift.\"\n\nIt was absolutely a wedding/engagement gift, not an I am just randomly gifting you a 4.5k chair for no reason at all. \n\nDoes it suck for friend yeah, normally I would say OP should give some time, but with the deadline OP can ask for it back with a clear conscious.", "Standard etiquette in much of the US is to ship wedding gifts to the home pf the bride prior to the wedding.", "Really? It\u2019s common in my community to give many wedding gifts at the engagement party.", "idk, for the last several weddings I've been to, they've had online registries and I just order through them. The recipients decide if they want to receive things all on one specific day, like after the wedding, or as they come in.  \n\n\nFor something big like a chair, that would require movers and furniture to be re-arranged, I could definitely see arranging delivery for before the wedding so there's time to do it properly.", "Are you fucking kidding me?", "Safety in numbers\u2026 and bring wine for the crushed friend", "Like\u2026 like bailiffs?", "I mean, I agree that this is what OP should do. But since she does want the chair back, she should wait a few weeks and then offer to help arrange returning the gifts. \n\nWhich, y\u2019know, she should do anyway, whether she chooses to let her friend keep the chair or not. (I\u2019m for letting the friend keep the chair.)", "Agreed.\n\nIf my friend of 15 years had just had their heart shattered in a manner similar to this, the absolute last thing I\u2019d be thinking about is the money I\u2019d stand to gain by returning their gift. I\u2019d be more concerned with making sure she were okay, and I\u2019d be even more motivated to do something to make her smile.", "Likely due to the type of item. Large items like perhaps furniture or large appliances, it\u2019s often easier to gift it before the wedding because after the wedding it\u2019s honeymoon and paperwork. Smaller things like quilts, boxed sets, or the like are easier to set out on the wedding day.", "Out of curiosity, where are you from? Because where I'm at, the only gifts that actually show up at the wedding are usually cash or checks. Gifts are given at the shower before, or shipped to the couple beforehand", "Where I'm from, the vast majority is gifted pre- wedding. Mostly via the bridal shower but some separate as well.", "It\u2019s pretty normal, especially for big things. You ship things to the house instead of having to lug it to a wedding.", "And common as it is to bring the gift to the wedding, it's actually etiquette not to burden the couple with gift items on the actual day. One should deliver/send them to the home before or after the wedding.", "We got all but a couple of our wedding gifts before the wedding. They started arriving at our house basically as soon as invitations went out. Only two physical gifts were brought to the wedding itself.

There are always people who bring gifts the day of. The problem is that it\u2019s another chore for someone to keep track of. Inevitably cards come off the gifts and sometimes gifts disappear all together.", "I assume she spent a lot of that time (in between, y\u2019know, crying) trying to figure out what she could salvage from the wedding itself. I really don\u2019t think three weeks is very much time to return a gift in the context of an engagement imploding. There just isn\u2019t any way dealing with gifts was the top item on her to-do list in this scenario.", "Three *months* maybe, but not three weeks.", "Yeah, I think I\u2019d tell my bff that she can plot her new best life from that fabulous chair. And joke (with some reality) that you\u2019ll get her a blender next time.\n\nI mean, really, Would you return the chair and then gift it again when she finds a better partner?

Toaster next time! \ud83e\udd42", "I agree about not asking.\n\nBut the ex bride (and moreso ex groom because he is at fault) really need to return gifts ASAP- not when they're back on their feet. It's on the former couple, not OP, to follow etiquette here.\n\nI also agree about not gifting above your means.", "It's not just about OP's chair. The bride likely has other gifts to return to gifters that are still in the return window. Etiquette says she can't really wait.\n\nEtiquette, shmettiquette for many things in life. But this one she should get moving on.", "If you gave someone a graduation gift, but then they dropped out of college a couple months before graduation because they got into a horrible accident or lost a loved one, would you ask for the gift back?

I gave it as a goft", "While I think it's kind of them to return the gifts, I would not bat an eye if they kept it and I would never ask.

Stupid to think everyone would do the right thing I guess.", "it\u2019s overall embarrassing to ask for a gift back.
