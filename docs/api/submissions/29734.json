This arrangement is between your Dad and your brother correct?\n\n\nBut since your Dad told him to save $500 a month and he didn't there's no money for a down payment despite 13 years passing.\n\n\nUnderstand your frustration. Probably not the best time to air things out but it sucks that your brother thinks your step mom should sell so they can continue to live rent free.  Understandable why you felt the family should hear \"the rest of the story.\"\n\n\nNTA\n\n\n\nUpdateMe", "NTA. Sounds like your brother will say/do just about anything to not have to pay rent. \n\nThe suggestion to pay rent would have to come from your dad, and he's not going to do it. Sadly, he shouldn't *have to ask (*if it's obvious to your brother that they're struggling after retirement, your bro should just step up!). But telling your dad to sell your step-mom's house is just BEYOND.", ">my dad was also embarrassed, as he doesn't want people to worry about his financial situation. \n\nOK if he doesn't want people to worry about it, then stop paying for all those things and YOU put the money you've been spending on your parents into a savings account for yourself.\n\nYour parents don't get to tell you to stay out of their business AND keep accepting money from you. Either you're out of their business--and don't give them money--or you object to them giving up an income source because they're living off your money.\n\nThough I DO think you should have discussed this with your father first. He's the one taking your money. He's the one refusing to sell either house they own. He's the one refusing to take money from your brother while being happy to take it from you. Sit down with your dad and step mom and tell them how hard it is for you to keep covering their expenses when they have two whole-ass houses they could sell or rent out to relieve you of that burden.", "NTA, your brother is being a leech. Tell him he needs to find someone to help look after her if he\u2019s that concerned and get his ass back to work, and if he thinks he\u2019s going to be retired at his age, then he\u2019s sorely mistaken.\n\nHow did his children react to hearing about this?", "NTA. I don't think your brother is going to decide whether or not to \"change his ways\" based on an apology (or lack of it) from you. So you just have to decide if mollifying your parents are enough of a reason. *\"Sorry I said something true that nevertheless upset dad and stepmom, bro.\"* \n\nFamily finances should be discussed (calmly) among the whole family that is impacted.", "NTA. Your brother needed a wake up call.", "NTA. Your dad needs to sell your childhood home. Let the next owner deal with evicting him.", "Esh.  Brother was out of line, but so were you.  Not the time or place for that discussion.", "ESH. Your brother is bad with money and is taking advantage of your father's generosity. But it wasn't your business to get involved in that. Your only voice should be:  \n1. The welfare of your father  \n2. If you are asked to contribute funds to the move and staying in a retirement home and your brother isn't going to share that equally.", "NtA don't apologize to someone who leeches this way", "YTA stop paying the bills for your dad and step mom. They don\u2019t want anything to change why seen you stressing yourself out about grown people?", "YTA. While you might mean well, you are inserting yourself into your parents business. They didn't ask you to intervene. They didn't ask you to be their advocate. You took this on yourself and decided for yourself who should be doing what and how. You even decide how severe someone else's disability is so it fits your narrative. I'm not saying that what others are doing is right or correct, but what you described here makes you an ah, too.", "ESH.  But YTA.\n\nThere was no reason for you to air everyone's personal financial laundry to everyone all at once.  His kids did NOT need to know this about their parents, you had no right to insert yourself into that.\n\nI get that you are frustrated by the situation and that you feel your parents are being taken advantage of, but get a hold of yourself.  Tell you dad and his wife, and your brother and his wife that you need to sit down and talk.  Tell them your concerns for both sides, and that you want them to find a solution so no one ends up losing the house, and therefore their homes.\n\nIf you really feel like your parents are being taken advantage of, have a serious talk just with them about your concerns.  But ultimately, this is THEIR situation, THEIR decision.", "People are going to disagree but YTA.  1st because you didn't just air out your brothers business you also aired out your parents.  Also you have no idea how bad his wife illness is so how can you say well she was good before so she should be good now....you do know her symptoms could have gotten worst over the years right.", "So YTA. \n\n1) brother has been using his savings and a disability check for the last 3 years\n2) his wife may need way more care than you think. Have you even bothered to see how much she\u2019s struggling. She\u2019s a disability check which means she can\u2019t even work a normal job or at all even. \n3) you aired out business you had no business airing out \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re more upset about helping your dad and stepmom than anything else and feel your brother should take the burden on instead. \n\nEven if your brother could make an offer in the house, how would he even afford the payments if he doesn\u2019t even have the 500 to pay your dad?", "YTA. Some brother you are... you are way too far into everyone's business. Focus on yourself and stop trying to order everyone else around.

That or at least keep silent!\n\nA totally valid reply, based on the situation.", "OP you truly felt it was worthwhile controlling the narrative in your family, and in directing the ire towards your brother you failed to realize several factors.  First, exactly how bad your SIL's disability is strictly based on her lack of ability to have any type of gainful activity when it comes to being employed.  Unless you're around her 24/7, you have no idea the depth of pain and fatigue she has to deal with, on top of a lot of guilt likely has because she knows there's no cure and likely bare management of her body and the disease.  Second of all, if you had simply just brought your dad and brother together without the entire family present, tried to come to some resolution without guns blazing in a fit of rage in front of everyone, then maybe you could have avoided the entire scene altogether.  You not only embarrassed your brother, sil, dad, step-mother, but also his kids, as well as the rest of the family and yourself as well trying to act like the hero.", "NTA", "[deleted]", "Because he refused to get a job\u2026", "[deleted]", "It does changes facts. It shows brother is a freeloader taking advantage of his near retirement parents while making no effort to earn more. \n\nThe facts are pretty simple", "Unfortunately, you can't turn back time. What your dad should have done was to accept the 500$/ month rent and saved it for your brother. Once the amount reached down payment level, he should have sold the house to your brother. Your brother would have then had motivation to keep working.\n\nIf your brother was working, would he earn more than the cost of a home health aide to care for his wife? If yes, then that's what he should be doing. Employment builds quarters in social security ( if you are in the US).without enough quarters, he would be losing out on that retirement income. Employment would also provide health insurance. Medications and treatment for fibromyalgia can be out of reach if you only have Medicaid. His wife's quality of life could be improved, and his quality of life could be improved. It is exhausting being the only caregiver for someone who is chronically I'll. Both your brother and his wife are probably suffering from depression- chronic illness, financial instability, failed business - all stressors that lead to depression, and only make their current mess worse.\n\nESH for the way you all have put off resolving this situation. Your brother's solution of having your step mom sell her house to pay for an inferior space in a retirement community so that he can keep mooching off his dad, is selfish and unrealistic. He and his wife need to move out of the house and find a studio apartment that they can afford on her disability. Your dad needs to sell HIS home to fund his retirement. This situation is not sustainable\n\nYou may want to look into what sort of services your SIL is entitled to with her disability to help allow your brother to get back to paying his own way. Talk to a social worker in adult services to get information on what's available, since you know your brother won't ( possibly due to his depression). Involve their kids in figuring out how to help their parents or the burden of providing for them will pass to them when your dad is no longer here. Will you force a sale of the house if it passes to both of you? ( you know your brother won't be able to buy you out). It's time to take a small step back, hold up on funding dad, until he figures out how to solve his problem with your brother. Otherwise you will be his financial backer and he will leave the house to just your brother, leaving you to be doubly screwed.", "YTA I guarantee those kids are going to remember this and it won\u2019t be in a positive way. That\u2019s so out of line. If you had a concern, you should have asked to speak to the adults, not blow up while children who have no fault in this heat you rip up their parents.", "NTA. Do not apologize", "NTA. Your brother is a leech and leeches deserve to be called out.", "ESH-Brother sucks and doesn\u2019t deserve an apology but everyone else does especially the kids ,could\u2019ve handled that way better and you don\u2019t know how bad his wife is.", "Is this a golden child vs scrape goat scenario I wonder....\nNTA ur subsiding EVERYONE here and by the sounds of it u have the least spare $$$ to spend on charity", "At this point they should be out from under whatever debt they incurred because of the restaurant.  \n\nHe can get a job or he can get on  IHSS to take care of his wife.  If he isn't doing so it's probably because he doesn't qualify. \n\nHe can drive for door dash or ubereats while his wife sleeps.", "well it was a talk that needed to happen. NTA\n\nembarassment does not feed people who are in need you know", "Solid point (about Dad wanting people to stay out of his business while taking money from OP) and well put.", "You\u2019re neglecting to mention the fact that the conversation was precipitated only because the brother suggested the parents SELL THEIR HOUSE to get money."]}
