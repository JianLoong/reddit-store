With my oldest due I didn\u2019t post her pictures until she was about a year old. Her dad didn\u2019t listen but that\u2019s not surprising.

So child's face can't be seen, unlike other family who may post child's face. I know many parents who don't post the child's face at all.

You can control what relatives post about your kid. If they choose to not adhere to your request, you put them on an info diet or stop allowing access to your kid. It comes down to people choosing to not respect your parenting choices.\n\nWe have a blanket no-social-media-posting rule for our son, whether photos or information like his fill name/birthday/school for safety reasons. My SIL didn't want to listen, so after repeatedly not listening to us, she doesn't get to see our kid anymore. She wanted to dig in her heels about it, and this was the consequence. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI don't want my son to be like my niece.

I've shared two pics of my niece since she was born 2.5 years ago. One was a pic that I'd added a cartoon filter to so while it looked like us, it also very clearly isn't. And the other was a far away pic when we were dancing and you can't see her face. I'm not her parent, I don't post her face.", "NTA. This is the common practice these days; no photos of children online without the parents' permission. MIL needs to get with the times. If she won't cooperate, don't send her any pictures and don't let her take any. If you have to, cover babies face when she tries to snap photos.", "No. Your child, your rules.  I have cousins that feel the same and the family cooperates with them.", "NTA. I have a 6 month old girl and there isn\u2019t 1 picture of her online, because we also told everyone not to post and we also don\u2019t.

Tho it would be kinda hypocrisy if you post public now, but I guess your post would be private, for a following of only friends and family. But be aware they could repost it or screenshot it. Or MIL could take your post and post it bc \"you are okay with that being online\" etc. Best would be, no posts at all. 2nd best no face, no markers to identify the kid (like birth marks), not many posts.", "NTA. The internet is a scary place and anyone can access your pictures.  Stick to your guns and if she tries to post a picture make sure you report her profile.", "NTA\n\nWhen my son was born we were quite clear with my mum. We don\u2019t post pictures of our son on any social media. She was told it\u2019s not allowed and if she went against our wishes, we wouldn\u2019t allow her any contact with him. \n\nWe have to be hard with her because she\u2019s the kind of person who takes a mile of you give her an inch.", "If you dont want his picture on social media then I don't understand why you're going to post his pic on social media. If you think you can control who sees the pictures you are sadly mistaken. Once you put something on the internet it's out there. You have no control.", "I mean unless you\u2019re going to be posting shots of your child from behind, to only get the back of their head, you yourself can\u2019t really control who is going to see your kid. Yes, you may have controls set on your social media, but anyone who\u2019s on your social media will see the picture. They can screenshot it, share it with other people etc. Regardless of who posts what, it\u2019s out there.", "Nta. It was really hard to make my FMIL understand that she can't post pictures of ME without my permission. When I told her it's my privilege to decide about my online presence she said that even thought I am a lawyer I don't have to play courtroom in my private life and I am very disrespectful to demand such thing because she has never asked for nobody's permission about posting pictures and she never will.\nWell, I won that battle she doesn't post pictures of me (at all). But I know I have two even bigger wars ahead of me. Because I won't allow wedding pictures to be posted of me either and she will hate it.\nBut what will be even harder to make her not only understand but also belive that I won't let her have unsupervised time with our future children if she doesn't respect our parental decisions (that will definitely include no pictures without permission rule).\n\nYour baby, your decision.", "NTA - there are a lot of weirdos out there. I don't let anyone post my child's image online, especially on major social media sites. Because my partner's family lives 10 hours away, though, we do use a secure website/app that is ONLY for our family members.", "NTA.", "NTA. \n\nIt's going to be difficult for you to regulate it to other members of the family, but once they break that trust they need to be removed from social media so they can't grab the photos off there for themselves to share. \n\nI had a similar issue with my own mum when mine was born, so instead of sharing it she started tagging all of her friends in the photos of my son, she couldn't understand why I was mad at that too. I unfriended her for a while to teach her a lesson. She was annoyed with me at first and upset that I unfriended her, but once she promised she wouldn't do it again she was back on SM and never did it again. \n\nSome people just need a consequence before they'll listen.", "NTA - it's your child and you have every right to protect them. To me it's always been weird that people so freely put photos of their kids/grandkids etc up on social media. I don't mind seeing a few photos every so often but I deleted my fb because I was seeing babies/children every single day, multiple times a day to the point if I was in town I would notice kids and be like \"oh that's (insert name here) kid\" and it freaked me out.", "NTA my husband refuses to let me post anything about our baby on social media for security reasons (military). The people who need to know know. The others will find out through the grapevine or when we take him to family events that involve them", "NTA. My FIL did this even making our daughter his profile picture to his Fbook account which had no privacy settings. I reported every post and in the end his account was suspended by Facebook. Only way he learnt his lesson as posting on social media is that man\u2019s life\u2026", "Nope. NTA. There are a whole host of reasons why you shouldn't even post pictures of your kids social media, let alone your parents.", "Never post pics of either my kids or my grandsons. You\u2019re absolutely correct about that. \n\nOne sure way to upset a mother. IT\u2019S NOT MY BABY!!!\n\nSo I didn\u2019t.", "NTA but good luck with that", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour kid, your rules. Report her ass if she does try to post.", "Nta your child you get to decide what gets put on the internet and what doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s not her place to post YOUR child if you don\u2019t want anyone to. I have 4 nieces and a nephew and they range in age from 3 to 19 and every single picture I have ever posted of any of them has been approved by the parents. I ask before I post because yea they are my nieces and nephew but they are not my children", "NTA. That's your choice and it's really not a hard boundary to respect. It's not even an odd choice. Most people like about of control over what pictures of their kids go on the web. I'd advise that you make sure your stepmother doesn't have access to the photos if she can't follow that rule though.", "NTA. It's a safety thing. My brother went through the same thing with both of my nephews; that kind of information stays up forever and you can't control who sees them without strict privacy settings. Not only could they be spread/seen by predators, Tey can also be used by scammers and other folk who might have bad intentions. Not even going into privacy concerns in general. Stick to your guns. Maybe share a couple articles about how photos of children online can be spread and shared maliciously but it's not your fault if she refuses to listen to your concerns.", "You are allowed to do this, but a few considerations:\n\n-The most normal thing in the world is wanting to show off a picture of a grandchild or niece or nephew. Nobody out living in the world is going to look askance at the motives of the people who want to show off a new member of the family. \n\n-While in the abstract, controlling this via request should work, it never, ever does. Grandmas know how to screenshot now. Technical restrictions won\u2019t work, and requests will make you sound odd to other people.\n\n-to the vast majority of people, a picture of a baby isn\u2019t something they connect with \u201cnow this baby can be victimized\u201d. It\u2019s not a social security number, it\u2019s not an address, it\u2019s a picture of a baby. One that you put on the internet. So strangers are gonna see it. Again, to most folks, this a \u201cso what? Somebody saw a baby? All babies look the same anyway\u201d kinda deal and they won\u2019t be able to wrap their heads around why it would be an issue in the first place.\n\nTo summarize, it\u2019s gonna be seen as a weird request, especially if you\u2019re posting pictures. People will assume there\u2019s a family conflict or power dynamic at work if they hear about it. Maybe NTA to some folks, but definitely gonna be seen as weird and a little over-controlling to most folks.", "NTA.  While they may be proud and want to share, it is ultimately your child's visage and they need to respect your wishes.", "NTA, it's quite normal not to want your child to be plastered all over social media, you don't know who is going to see them on other people's posts. If she respects you & your wife, then she won't post any pics, go ahead & report her if she does. If she wants to show off her grandchild to people, then she can do it in person by showing them the pics from her device.", "NTA. It's really not a great idea to post pics all over social media in general, let alone of babies and small children.", "NTA. This is your right and I think there's even laws about this.", "NTA. We had to have this battle with my folks as well.", "Just reading your title I'm going with NTA. Your child your choice until old enough to decide for themselves.", "Very easy.  That child cannot provide consent re- whether or not their photos from the moment they are born is on the internet.   That has VAST ramifications- positive and negatives.  It\u2019s a very simple concept.  If you don\u2019t understand this, for the love of everything, don\u2019t have a kid (adoption or otherwise).", "NTA and if stepmom-in-law is going to violate a simple boundary, she doesn't get to see the child at all", "NTA, it's understandable that you don't want pictures of your kid on social medias. Plus, until the kid is able to decide on their own, the parents are the ones that make these kind of decisions.", "NTA, your child, your rules. \n\nWhrn my SIL had her child, I posted a pic of me holding him and she nicely asked if I would remove it as she didn't want him being put online. What did I do? Removed it. No fuss.", "NTA. But don\u2019t send her photos. She can see the ones you post. And if she tries to take any while she sees baby, say no. And if she tries, take baby. That\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll keep photos offline.", "ESH your kid I suppose but this a weird hill to die on.", "NTA. Just tell your wife\u2019s step mom if she posts any pictures she is banned from seeing your child.", "NTA\nAs the parent, you have every right to protect the privacy of your child and family. There are just some pictures you may not feel comfortable sharing online, and you should be able to choose the ones you are. My son is almost two, and I still barely post him. There's weirdos out there.  \n\nOn another note, I found the use of the Family Album app very helpful. It allows you a private album to share photos with friends and family of YOUR choosing. Everyone you invite gets access to the same photos.", "NTA. We had this exact rule (our boy is now 3 and still do) and the only issue it caused was with my mum. No one else has any issues with it at all and most people ask before posting anyways (it\u2019s normal etiquette for children anyways to protect them). My mum has posted countless times without permission and we are now very low contact because of this. We don\u2019t send any photos to her because she can\u2019t be trusted. \n\nI would stick to it! You know who\u2019s on your socials and the more it ventures out then the more people have access. Better to be safe.", "I know quite a few people who are like this. Your kid, your decision", "NTA. If the step family is as entitled, you may as well want to get rules about who can kiss and hold the newborn. Trust me you\u2019d be glad to avoid some diseases", "NTA and your SMIL is being a total AH.  \n\n\nI would simply tell her that if she posts a single picture of your child without your permission, you will keep her from the child until she is trustworthy.", "The only AHs in this scenario are family members who do not respect that you do not want pictures of your newborn posted on social media.", "NTAH ITS YOUR KID & YOUR RULES simply put. I would report the pic \u201cif she post it\u201d & her whole page entirely if she post something again after the 1st time.

You made that sweet little baby! You don't need to explain yourself to anyone!", "NTA as that's your choice, BUT. Prior to SM, grandparents ran around showing everyone their physical photos of the grandchildren, including strangers. In her mind, it might be the same thing if she doesn't understand how the internet works. My grandmother wouldn't. She's proud to be a grandparent. She's still going to show your photos to people in person, I'm sure so be prepared for that.", "Report every pic she posts-- and get other family members to check because she may set her privacy settings so you can't see when she posts. Then TOTALLY block her from all of your social media as well as your FIL since he will likely share the pics with her and any other family members you think might share with her.", "What is the matter with random people seeing baby\u2019s pictures? It wouldn\u2019t affect him. I honestly don\u2019t understand.", "There was an article a while back where multiple people posted about finding their photos in places they wouldn't expect to see them. Two of those stories really stood out to me. One was a person who'd traveled to a foreign country and found a photo of their whole family printed out on a pillow for people to buy. The other one was a person who'd discovered that someone they were friends with or worked with - I forget which - was taking photos of their husband and children and then posting them to her (the friend/coworker's account) social media with new names and new backgrounds while claiming them to be her own husband and children. It absolutely can affect OPs baby as well as OP", "The fact that your mind doesn\u2019t go to dark places is great, but unfortunately I\u2019ve seen and learned too much about the sick people that are out there. It\u2019s scary to think of potentially exposing your children\u2019s private information to random strangers on the internet. The fact is once a child\u2019s pictures are out there, it\u2019s hard to control what people might do with them. A cute picture of baby playing in the bath might be adorable to most people, but some people may get sick gratification from it. You just never know.
