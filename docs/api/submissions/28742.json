It's entirely up to the parents to decide how they want to handle the crapshoot that is social media. There's plenty of sick people out there. If step-grandma wants to show off the grandkid, she can show random strangers pictures of her grandkids just like they did in the olden days.", "NTA. You are starting off right, protecting your child's privacy. If you let her post pictures now she'll continue to do it.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019ve had friends not post their kids on media and I\u2019ve held off on mine as they don\u2019t like to do so (they are older).\n\nOne friend I have posts something to the effect \u201csoandso just turned 2! If you want a photo dm and will send, photos are not posted on social media\u201d\u2026 and if you ask she sends a picture. Works well I thought. \n\nYour mil sounds a bit naive, perhaps if you give more info about why it might help (stolen images, etc)", "\"You post one picture and you will be banned from seeing this kid until they're 18, got it?\"   \nNTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s your child. It\u2019s your choice, not anyone else\u2019s, no matter how proud they are of them.", "NTA.", "Nope perfectly reasonable not to want your children all over social media.", "Absolutely not! That is your baby and you're protecting it's privacy. Stepmom needs to respect the boundaries that have been set, and your little family!", "NTA. It\u2019s your kid so it should be your choice!", "NTA, yet. You cannot control digital media especially when it comes to your relatives. You are welcome to curate how you post images of your newborn and who can see it. But how exactly do you plan on preventing your family from posting anything? Even if your family did everything \u201cright\u201d by your directive, what\u2019s stopping a cousin or friend you gave access to from taking a screen grab and reposting?

I totally understand someone not wanting to post photos of their child on social media. She should respect your choice. What do your wife think about this?", "NTA, your 'wife stepmom' should be respecting your decision to not post your child's pictures on social media. And I'm not sure about this fact but, posting pictures of your child online exposes them to identity theft, like people taking the picture and using it for false identities.", "NTA.\nIt\u2019s your child, not theirs.  This is a boundary I would hold firm on.  It\u2019s great that they\u2019re proud of their grandchild, but this is not a call for anyone else to make aside from the child\u2019s parents.", "NTA she needs to quit being so entitled and realize there are some wack people out there.", "NTA. Your child, your rules and tell stepmum if she breaks those (entirely reasonable and understandable) rules she won\u2019t get any pictures full stop.", "Not at all. Tell granny to chill.", "NTA. Parents have every right to be in control of this.", "NTA, but you probably don't have as much control as you want. All these social media sites these days are designed to make you think you have all these privacy settings you enable but at the end of the day, when you trust your data to these sites, there is a chance it ends up where you dont want it to. Better just to forgo posting and share direct with family and friends via more secure methods.", "NTA - why can\u2019t she roll old skool and send a pic of her and the baby to a select few she is close to? A baby doesn\u2019t need to be posted online at all. A parent has the right to protect their child and if someone doesn\u2019t agree that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s not their child and not their call.", "It's not about OP not wanting pictures on social media at all, it's about controlling when and where the pictures are posted. The internet never forgets, and it seems stepmother doesn't want to respect that boundary.", "NTA there are no pictures of my son on social media where he could be recognised, only pictures taken from behind to show a wider picture. And only I'm allowed to post them. I will protect my son until he's old enough to make the decision himself.", "NTA but your wife\u2019s step mom is a big AH. How are you going to know if she does post pictures? That would be the end of her seeing my child in person. Defying you as the parent shows she has no respect for you or your child. She\u2019s proud of him? She had nothing to do with creating him. What part does she think she plays in this? What an asshole she is.", "No.", "NTA. I had the same deal when my kid was born. I think it is ok to send pictures of the kid to selected friends and family through private channels, but posting them on social media or not os the patents decision.", "NTA. I would give grandma a physical photo of the baby and let her show her friends, in person.", "NTA\n\nBut Y T A If you or your wife decide to post pictures of your child on social media before the child is old enough to consent to it, obv.", "Nta warn her if she does  it will  be the last  time  she saw your  child.", "NTA- It is your right as the Parent to limit what is posted with your child's image until they are of age and can give their own consent. If she does it, definitely report her, every single time! Or block her from your Socials so she cannot share the pictures.", "Not the AH. With my oldest due I didn\u2019t post her pictures until she was about a year old. Her dad didn\u2019t listen but that\u2019s not surprising. If some family wanted to see a picture of her, I sent it via messenger,text or email. Honestly I was glad I did. I wasn\u2019t constantly asked for new photos. I was actually able to enjoy that precious age without worrying about any trouble.", "NTA, your child, your choice", "When you set a reasonable boundary and someone stomps over it that\u2019s always a red flag and it\u2019s seldom the last time it will happen. Don\u2019t let her see your child until she pulls her head out her butt, it\u2019s your baby not some thing she can do with as she pleases.", "I think it's reasonable for you to want pics of your kid not to be shared on social media, but I think there's ways you can make it easier.\n\nYour family members place some sort of value on \"showing off\" the newborn on social media, is it possible to provide them with a cute pic of the baby's hands, feet, or something else that doesn't show the baby's face?", "They may just post pictures of the child from behind. So child's face can't be seen, unlike other family who may post child's face. I know many parents who don't post the child's face at all. Shots are from side or behind and you cannot see any facial features", "We have a family chat on messenger. Maternal family all over the country (Australia) are part and so is the family member who lives over seas. The only person not in the chat is my grandmother who lives with my aunt and uncle who are in the family chat plus my cousin brought my grandmother a Skylight photo frame for Xmas. I only post photos of my kids in that family chat and send pictures to my grandmothers frame (then call her to let her know to turn the frame on to see them). \n\nI haven't posted on social media in about 4-5yrs now since my aunt started the chat group.", "It's the child's choice and before they are old enough to consent to it: no Pictures of children in social media.", "Hard disagree. You can control what relatives post about your kid. If they choose to not adhere to your request, you put them on an info diet or stop allowing access to your kid. It comes down to people choosing to not respect your parenting choices.\n\nWe have a blanket no-social-media-posting rule for our son, whether photos or information like his fill name/birthday/school for safety reasons. My SIL didn't want to listen, so after repeatedly not listening to us, she doesn't get to see our kid anymore. She wanted to dig in her heels about it, and this was the consequence. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI don't want my son to be like my niece. She went for her first job and found out her potential employer found ridiculous photos of her when she was little, and lovely posts about her potty training status. Poor kid was so embarrassed she cried.", "A friend of mine has the same rule for family. Her MIL has so far ignored it twice (in 4 months). OP might need to expect people doing it regardless", "Morally, I agree.  Legally, it is OP's call, at least in my country.", "Those are people that get to see none of OP\"s posts and can take no photos of baby."]}
