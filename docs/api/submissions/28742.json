It's entirely up to the parents to decide how they want to handle the crapshoot that is social media. There's plenty of sick people out there. If step-grandma wants to show off the grandkid, she can show random strangers pictures of her grandkids just like they did in the olden days.", "NTA. You are starting off right, protecting your child's privacy. If you let her post pictures now she'll continue to do it.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019ve had friends not post their kids on media and I\u2019ve held off on mine as they don\u2019t like to do so (they are older).\n\nOne friend I have posts something to the effect \u201csoandso just turned 2! If you want a photo dm and will send, photos are not posted on social media\u201d\u2026 and if you ask she sends a picture. Works well I thought. \n\nYour mil sounds a bit naive, perhaps if you give more info about why it might help (stolen images, etc)", "\"You post one picture and you will be banned from seeing this kid until they're 18, got it?\"   \nNTA.", "NTA.

That is your baby and you're protecting it's privacy. Stepmom needs to respect the boundaries that have been set, and your little family!", "NTA. It\u2019s your kid so it should be your choice!", "NTA, yet. You cannot control digital media especially when it comes to your relatives. You are welcome to curate how you post images of your newborn and who can see it. But how exactly do you plan on preventing your family from posting anything? Even if your family did everything \u201cright\u201d by your directive, what\u2019s stopping a cousin or friend you gave access to from taking a screen grab and reposting?

I totally understand someone not wanting to post photos of their child on social media. She should respect your choice. What do your wife think about this?", "NTA, your 'wife stepmom' should be respecting your decision to not post your child's pictures on social media. And I'm not sure about this fact but, posting pictures of your child online exposes them to identity theft, like people taking the picture and using it for false identities.", "NTA.\nIt\u2019s your child, not theirs.

It\u2019s great that they\u2019re proud of their grandchild, but this is not a call for anyone else to make aside from the child\u2019s parents.", "NTA she needs to quit being so entitled and realize there are some wack people out there.", "NTA.

Parents have every right to be in control of this.", "NTA, but you probably don't have as much control as you want. All these social media sites these days are designed to make you think you have all these privacy settings you enable but at the end of the day, when you trust your data to these sites, there is a chance it ends up where you dont want it to. Better just to forgo posting and share direct with family and friends via more secure methods.", "NTA - why can\u2019t she roll old skool and send a pic of her and the baby to a select few she is close to? A baby doesn\u2019t need to be posted online at all. A parent has the right to protect their child and if someone doesn\u2019t agree that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s not their child and not their call.", "It's not about OP not wanting pictures on social media at all, it's about controlling when and where the pictures are posted. The internet never forgets, and it seems stepmother doesn't want to respect that boundary."]}
