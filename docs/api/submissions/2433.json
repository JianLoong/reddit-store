Luckily, he doesn't mind being low contact. I do not get along with my MIL and SIL because of this too, however, I'm not as strong as my husband and they often cause me a lot of distress, but he ALWAYS defends me/ stands up for me.\n\nDue to us having a baby (our first), I'm very weary of letting my in laws meet the baby at all (my husband agrees). I at least wanted to wait a few weeks/ maybe a month or so after giving birth, so I wasn't so all over the place and looking super dreadful (I hope). \n\nHowever, my husband wants us to go so his great grandma can meet her great great grandchild before she passes. To be honest I'm hesitant. Mainly due to the abusive behaviours of MIL and SIL (I can describe in comments if needed), however there are a few other things. Such as, there's going to be a lot of people there and I have a bad time dealing with crowds of people as it is (14 at the LEAST), I've never met his great grandma so that will be nerve wracking, general over whelming a couple weeks after birth, alcohol will be present and I don't want drunk people near the baby, I don't want the baby getting sick or anything as my husbands family have a habit of not telling us when they are sick. Note that I have an auto immune disorder and just having the common cold can make be quite unwell. \n\nSo I know my husband is asking out of desperation because, before he found out his great grandma was coming, he was adamant that he wouldn't be visiting them and we would go to my parents for Christmas (they get along and it would only be mum, dad and maybe brother there), but I'm not really comfortable going and taking our baby. \n So WIBTA if I said no? I'm thinking yes, but I'm anxious and stressed at the thought of dealing with his mother and sister.\n\nPlease note: he can't go alone for a few personal reasons. So its either no one goes or we all go. \nAlso we can not visit great grandma by ourselves because she lives far away, so this will be her only chances.\n\nEdit for clarification: \nGreat gradma is not sick in the way that its an illness, just that she is very old and frail and this may be her last Christmas.

This is the worst season for RSV and flu that the medical community has seen in forever. Hospitals are literally overrun right now with sick kids and your *infant* shouldn\u2019t be exposed to extra people just for the hell of it. The only person who matters is great grandma.\n\nEdited to add \u2014 To be clear, NTA", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re probably both underestimating post birth recovery time, and you\u2019ll likely both be too exhausted to do it anyway.", "NTA. Keeping the baby safe is your and should be everyone\u2019s primary concern. Given their track record for not mentioning when ill it\u2019s sensible. It\u2019s not the same but have them FaceTime.", "I wouldn\u2019t. I mean I def wouldn\u2019t go for the abuse alone but it\u2019s RSV season and it\u2019s not joke. I\u2019m 35 weeks pregnant right now and we are not going to Christmas Eve because of how many people will be there / some of them are unvaxd. It\u2019s not worth risking your baby for that alone but if they\u2019re also abusive then I wouldn\u2019t even feel bad. NTA", "If he is so close to great grandma. Why does MIL need to gate keep the relationship? Why is the only time he can see her on Christmas, at MIL\u2019s? Why can\u2019t you guys visit her to meet the baby on a random Tuesday, without MIL?", "NTA. Could you find out the time great grandma will be there. If she\u2019s there\u2019s before everyone else, could you possibly met her then? If not, then just go to your family\u2019s and enjoy your day.", "NTA. Momma to be, you are right on with your instincts. We welcomed our first baby in July. L&D went horribly wrong and I ended up with a C-section. I was stuck in bed for awhile and had trouble doing much of anything outside of holding my baby. Newborn baby\u2019s require constant attention. They need to eat really frequently because their tummies are so small. This also means lots of diaper changes. Two of my friends new babies have been hospitalized due to illness and one has been hospitalized for over a week. My fourth month old got covid from daycare and we are on week two with him being sick, thankfully he has been doing well. Unless you have a scheduled c-section you really can\u2019t know for certain when your baby is coming. There is no way I could have felt comfortable physically or mentally turning around and traveling with a new baby. You need that time to recover and spend time with your baby.  \nGoing so soon puts you all at risk of getting sick and traveling with a newborn is really challenging. There is no reason to put yourself and your baby in that position. If he isn\u2019t comfortable going alone, they can face time or he can plan another trip. But the risk is too high.", "MIL invited great gma to manipulate you. It would be awesome to make that very elderly lady's day to see the baby but no one can make that decision for you. Sometimes when dealing with jerks you have to be an AH. They force us into these situations. Don't ruin your first Christmas with baby.", "NTA- too soon to be out in a crowd with a newborn. Your baby\u2019s health is paramount. If you decide to go, have great-grandma come out to the car to see the baby, take some pictures and go home. You also need to have some peace of mind knowing that you protected your baby from unnecessary/possible exposure to illness and also gave your husband a chance to show his grandmother your new baby.", "NTA. Your baby will be too young to have had vaccinations and develop an immune system. Winter months are the worst for viruses and bringing your newborn around that many unfamiliar people can be risky. I note from your other comments that MIL is unvaccinated- even more risky.\n\nYou've said you have never met great-grandma before which is quite surprising. Your husband claims to be close to her yet has never introduced her to his wife. This gives off alarm bells to me.\n\nIf your husband so desperately wants to see his great-grandma \"for the last time\" then he should go himself to see her at another time. Your baby's immunity and your post-birth recovery is priority. \n\nWishing you a very healthy and safe birth, and congrats on your upcoming newborn.", "Absolutely NTA. Please do not go. Explain to your husband about RSV, the risk to your baby being around unvaccinated people etc. Find a way for great grandma to see the baby without you having to go.", "NTA but is there any way you could meet his great-grandmother separately/briefly?\nI can understand your husband wanting to introduce his baby to her if she is so unwell.", "NTA, but considering you know how he feels about his family, it must be very important to him if he's willing to be around his family just to have his grandmother meet the baby. It might be worth considering for that reason alone. \n\nAs someone suggested, maybe try going before or after the crowd comes.", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t commit to anything until after you give birth. You will still be recovering from giving birth. I get that your husband can\u2019t travel alone, can friend or family member travel with him. I know it\u2019s a long shot because it\u2019s Christmas. I wouldn\u2019t want to travel that soon after giving birth and most newborns hate being in car seats so it would be a hot mess.", "**NTA**   If she's visiting for a few days, could your husband not go get her to spend a day at your house.  He could try to set it up directly with her before she arrives  and frame it as a fragile newborn who shouldn't be in a crowd.", "You cannot expose such young baby to a bunch of people! Ask your pediatrician, but the babies have undeveloped immune system, and exposure to the germs of a whole bunch of relatives might be harmful. The meet-and-greet has to wait few months.\n\nSend granny pics.\n\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA - Here\u2019s the thing. I think it\u2019s fair to say, based on your post, that your husband will regret it if great grandma never gets to meet LO, and that really is very sad, truly. But YOU are not the source of that regret and sadness just because you\u2019re the one identifying the danger and drawing that line to protect your baby.\n\nIt sounds like your husband is a very kind person who\u2019s dealing with some difficult emotions surrounding the situation. I\u2019ve lost several people recently and from my own experience I can tell you that sometimes it\u2019s hard to see past those feelings and acknowledge the very difficult truth that the thing we want isn\u2019t the thing that\u2019s right for everyone.\n\nI would guess that if you bring up your concerns, he\u2019ll reach the same conclusion you have, even if it\u2019s hard.", "Ok so if great great grandma is so unwell, why is she going to be there on Christmas?  \n\n\nBased on your MIL and SILs behavior I'm willing to bet this is a trap for your husband so they get to meet the newborn.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI will give you an antidote though.my first outing after being born was to see my mom's granddad in the nursing home before he died, I was like 5-6 weeks old. And hearing that story growing up was empactful because my great-granddad was something special, and I'm glad he got to see me before he died, even if I don't remember it. And as I've lived I found the importance of that, my kids will never get to meet any of my grandparents or one of theirs, so I defiantly see where husband is coming from.\n\nSo maybe ya'll could go and just not stay very long. But honestly with the flu already being so bad this year, not to mention RSV and other upper respitory conditions, I honestly wouldn't risk not only for the baby's sake put your own. Birthing is dramatic on the body of \"normal\" women but you have an autoimune disorder, it's bound to be harder on you. Especially if you have a c-section, that's major surgery and additional drama for your body. It will be too soon post birth, you need to stay home and take care of yourself and the baby.", "YWNBTA.  You will have a very vulnerable newborn, and that's a totally legit reason to limit exposures.  Heees a thought: might you three do a virtual visit, like a Zoom meeting or Facetime?  That would at least give your hubby's Ggma the chance to see the baby and meet you while also limiting your interaction.", "NTA - That environment sounds like a bad place for a newborn and a newly postpartum mother for a number of reasons. This is a time in your life that you should be fiercely protective of your time, your sleep, your mental health, and obviously the health and wellness of your family. A big get together of toxic people sounds like a bad idea", "NTA\n\n1. Newborns should not be around crowds because of the risk of contracting things including but not limited to RSV, the flu, and COVID before they themselves have a size and health to withstand infections. Plus you mention your own health and disorder!\n\n2. You're going to be exhausted.  Let whoever is useful to have around come your way.\n\n3. You could have a baby late and the baby could be born even closer to Christmas.  I have friend that have gone between 41 and 42 weeks gestation.", "NTA. I gave birth a few weeks before Christmas. I had an emergency C-section. Even at Christmas I could barely get up a flight of stairs let alone visit anyone. You will be beyond sleep deprived, bleeding and engorged. Don't go.", "NTA. Really nobody even has to read the whole thing. Once you talk about having a baby that\u2019s it. The answer is no. You need to stay where you are the most comfortable. We never know how the birth will go or how we will feel after having a baby. It\u2019s sad because d the great grandma won\u2019t get to meet the baby but it isn\u2019t best for you and the baby to travel so soon.", "Nope nope nope NTA. I had my baby mid  2021 and you better believe I didn\u2019t go anywhere pregnant or with my newborn. If ppl want to meet the baby they come to us and if they aren\u2019t vaccinated then they don\u2019t come at all. Babies seriously have no immune system. It\u2019s not worth it to risk your child\u2019s health for this.", "Yes, YWBTA, but mildly so. This is baby's only chance to meet G.Gramdma. Go early before most people arrive, get that photo op, focus on G.G. and baby, them have an exit plan in place so you can make good your escape.
