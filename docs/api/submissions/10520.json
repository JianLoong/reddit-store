I am so sorry that you are being put through this bullshit. You are a single mum, running a business alone, all you asked for is to cover the cost of materials/produce, which is super fair!

She thinks she is entitled to a big fancy expensive order for FREE? From a single mother trying to make a living, raise her kids?\n\nThat was in effect theft of your goods and services. Your offer of Having her only pay costs was a big gift! You had the good sense to tell her she had to pay that upfront, right?  \n\nNow that she has refused your generous offer, you can just ignore the selfish witch, and her family of flying monkeys.", "NTA, given this is your livelyhood, your sister is acting very entitled.  I mean seriously it wasn't something as simple as a layer cake, she sounds like she went over the top and expected you to pay for it all.", "NTA, if you owned a car dealership would she expect you to give her a new car? It's business, not personal. I could see giving her a value equal to the amount you usually spend on her birthday and graduation, but no more. Does anyone else in the family own a business that they would be willing to give her an amount equal? That isn't fair, and your sister is being immature and needs to grow up.", "I was halfway through this post going its sounding like you promised to do her order and then got busy and decided not to. But NTA.  Your sisters trying to take advantage of you and is an AH. What does she do? Can you have her do it free for you? Offering the ingredient cost is totally fair for a birthday/course finish date.", "This is what I hate about having a business that is based on artistic talent. Family believes that instead of coming to you to support you by giving you their business, they think they should get their items for free which actually hurts you and does nothing to help you.\n\nYou were nice enough to charge your sister just the cost of ingredients and she still acted like an entitled brat. I wonder if they have lawyers and accountants in their family, if they think they should get their services for free as well?\n\nNTA-- and don't second guess yourself.", "NTA! You\u2019re a single parent and rely on these orders to keep a roof over your head. Your sister of all people should understand the situation and be ashamed of herself for even suggesting you provide it for free. But your parents could absolutely have stepped in an paid for the ingredients as part of her gift if they felt it was something you absolutely HAD to contribute. Your presence should be all that\u2019s required at someone\u2019s party.", "NTA. Cake ingredients are expensive! Has your sister looked at egg prices lately?? (My kids are banned from eggs. Our eggs are strictly for use as an ingredient in a recipe right now.) Sure, you have the ingredients, but you have them for paying projects.\n\nEver notice how the people that feel others should just make something for free never offer to help cover the costs? Are they also planning on giving extravagant gifts? Probably not.", " NTA. She is a terrible narcissist and any family who takes her side are also terrible\npeople. If they think she\u2019s entitled to free cake, how about they make it? They won\u2019t, because they suck and are a bunch of\n free-loaders.

That's garbage. And not only would you lose money in the act of making this for your sister but also lose time making other orders. Why do they not want you to pay your bills? Such a bad aunt and grandparents.", "NTA - You see when a family member has a business, the idea is supposed to be that you want to buy from them for whatever you're doing so the money goes to family instead of someone else and you are supporting them. Anything they choose to do for you cheap/free in the transaction is the bonus/friends and family discount. That's on the owner of the business to choose to do not the buyer.

Family is suppose to help each other out, and helping each other out means if your sister is a single mom, raising two kids, and trying to keep a business you pay her what she is worth. \n\nHope your sister sees this and apologizes", "NTA.   Ask your parents if they want to pay for the ingredients.  I would add up the cost of the ingredients and send it to everyone along with what you would charge for the finished product.  Then remind them you are supporting yourself and 2 children and not running a charity.", "NTA. Having her cover the ingredients was the perfect compromise, that way your gift to her would be your time and skills.

She ordered things to a 150 people party", "I don\u2019t even know 150 people, lol! But seriously, only 60-75% of people invited to a party will show up.
