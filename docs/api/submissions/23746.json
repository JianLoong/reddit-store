I called a locksmith from a local locksmith service. When I spoke to the dispatcher on the phone, she informed me the service could be paid for with a credit card, and would cost around $70 total. The locksmith got me back into my car and afterward told me the service was cash only. I told him I didn't get cash out because I was told I could pay with card over the phone. He told me then, that I could pay my invoice through his business Venmo. I scanned the QR code to find him and he took my phone and typed in something and handed it back. \n\nHe had charged me $250.00 I had not agreed to. I tried to confront him, but he drove off in his car. I attempted to call the company multiple times to dispute this, but no one answered or \"was able to help me.\" I decided to file a Venmo claim, as well as a claim through the fraud center at my bank to close the card. I am now permanently locked out of Venmo, and have a new card. I did not have to pay for the services either. \n\nThis seemed like the right course of action, but as I was explaining this story to multiple friends and family members, everyone kept saying that what I did was dishonest.

He asked if he could \"see something real quick, to verify I had the correct business Venmo.\" I trusted that was what he was doing, but I was naive. Some people I know felt that I acted foolishly (in addition to not properly reading reviews, and locking my keys in the car in the first place). They feel that I should have been more responsible overall, and that filing a fraud claim was a \"get out of jail free card.\" A couple of people said it seemed like I just wanted free services. It didn't occur to me that I was in the wrong until others said I was, so I wanted to get unbiased opinions.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
