My husband and I met right before the pandemic so I did not get a chance to meet his family until summer of 2021 when we were already engaged.  Even though we are different people my PIL are really lovely people,\n\nSo, Mark\u2019s sister, Ashley (33F), is married to John (47M). They do not have any kids because John doesn\u2019t want anymore and has taken steps to ensure this does not happen after they got together but didn't tell her.  He has 3 kids from his 1st marriage which ended when he met Ashley 6 years ago.  She does not work and relies on her husband for all her expenses which has been a strain on the relationship. She pretends everything is perfect.\n\nMy husband and I are both hard workers and savers.  We are not cheap but we budget everything and we spend money thoughtfully. We were in very similar financial situations when we met and decided to share finances rather than worry about splitting everything.  We go out to dinner once a week and travel 3-4 times a year because we have the means.\n\nLast weekend my in-laws and Ashley along with my family came to our place for the Super Bowl.  My family is close by but Mark\u2019s is a plane ride away so they were staying with us.  We live in a high-cost-of-living city in the northeast of the US so we have a smaller place but we own it.  My in-laws took our guest room which doubles as an office and we put my SIL in our \u201cspare space\u201d which is an oversized closet I use as a \u201creading room.\u201d\n\nFrom the moment they arrived on Friday, my SIL was making negative comments about our lifestyle/things. She commented about her not having her own bedroom/bathroom, our building, the view, my clothes (not designer), our travel plans, our lack of children, only having one car instead of 2, the alcohol we provided, and the place we picked for dinner. She pretty much had something negative to say about everything.\n\nIt came to a head during halftime when Rihanna was performing. My brother asked which country she was from (because he forgot) and my SIL said St. Maarten and I laughed and said no, Barbados, then she knows because she and her husband own a home in St Maarten and I wouldn\u2019t know because we don\u2019t travel. I finally snapped and said she should ask her husband since he is actually the one that owns the home just like everything she has.\n\nThis is where I may have been the asshole, I asked her just how ironclad her prenup was (It is very secure and is an issue in their marriage) and then questioned her about her timeline on children. She got really flustered and then spent the second half of the game in her \u201croom.\u201d The rest of the night was a little awkward but no one said anything to me. I said goodbye to my PIL before I went to work on Monday but my SIL was \u201cstill sleeping.\u201d My husband thinks I was a little harsh but that she had it coming and my parents just thought it was out of character for me. SIL was pissed the whole trip home.\n\nETA: I just want to be clear that my SIL was loudly negative to anyone that would listen including our friends who met up with us on Friday, family dinner on Saturday and in front of my family on Sunday.

Jf no one else is mad at you in your family, then it was just a matter of time that someone said all this to Ashley.", "ESH You might be child-free, but your husband isn't missing out.", "ESH. She sucks u sucks. The end", "ESH. Two wrongs don't make a right.", "NTA but Info: does she know her husband can\u2019t get her pregnant or is she still ignorant of that?", "She didn't even own her glass home.", "What does ESH stand for?", "ESH You're equally awful.", "Are you here for the judgment or to argue?", "Then stay home.  Other people  aren't at fault  nor are they obligated  to swallow your constant negativity in their own home  or being  criticized  constantly.  Nta  op.", "I'm happy for you that you never been in bad state in life but this is how depression is developed. Just because you're unhappy doesn't mean you don't deserve to be around people or don't deserve support. It's a very naive and privileged way to think.\n\nEspecially since the woman already seems to be in an abusive relationship.", "I was in a very deep  depression  that however didn't  caused me to crap on other people. How  exactly is the sil  in an abusive relationship? Her husband asked her to work  she refused  he limited her spending  money. Did I miss something?!\n\nI and never said she didn't  deserve  support if she is depressed  but support  doesn't  equal  being  insulted  in your own home.", "Yes, you missed the part where the lady dreams of kids and the husband, apparently behind her back, got vasectomy. Which is what OP referenced in the first place.\n\nAnd you're really making leaps with the \"insults\". Not even OP said they were insults, just negative comments. The only comment we see is \"You can't know, you don't travel.\" If that's your level for insults than I find that honestly ridiculous. Also, if THAT is the level of negativity OP has dealt with, OP is an extremely sensitive person to blow up over that like this. Clap back, make fun of her but attacking someone like this is overblown.\n\nAll I'm saying is that making negative comments from someone in a bad life situation doesn't warrant attacking someone with outright hurtful things like being unable to have kids because the husband is a manipulative asshole.", "I saw that  ,but op had nothing  to do with it .\nyou also don't  know if the sil husband  has told her clearly  before the marriage  he didn't want kids with her and she thought  she could  change  his mind. I doubt  he just got a vasectomy  with no reason=> don't agree  with the behind her back  part but it was his decision about his body. \n\nOp being  told the whole  time I have this/that and it's  way bigger/better  that what you have is demeaning  and negative  as well as 'oh you can't  afford  this ?I can and have x version'  .  \n\nYou can be depressed  and still  respectful  to others  especially  if they are doing  you the favor  of hosting you when you invited yourself with  no invitation  extended  from the host.  Sil should  be grateful  op didn't  throw her out of her house as she would  have been  unable  to pay for a hotel. \n\nBeing depressed  is NOT en excuse nor license  to be an AH.", "I'm out of this discussion, you're claiming things not even OP is claiming, things that go directly against OP's statements and defending manipulation by the lady's husband.", "YTA. It\u2019s none of your business if your in-laws paid for her. You seem much too invested in your SIL\u2019s financials and honestly jealous that they have things you don\u2019t."]}
