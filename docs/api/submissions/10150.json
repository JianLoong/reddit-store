My husband and I met right before the pandemic so I did not get a chance to meet his family until summer of 2021 when we were already engaged.  Even though we are different people my PIL are really lovely people,\n\nSo, Mark\u2019s sister, Ashley (33F), is married to John (47M). They do not have any kids because John doesn\u2019t want anymore and has taken steps to ensure this does not happen after they got together but didn't tell her.  He has 3 kids from his 1st marriage which ended when he met Ashley 6 years ago.  She does not work and relies on her husband for all her expenses which has been a strain on the relationship. She pretends everything is perfect.\n\nMy husband and I are both hard workers and savers.  We are not cheap but we budget everything and we spend money thoughtfully. We were in very similar financial situations when we met and decided to share finances rather than worry about splitting everything.  We go out to dinner once a week and travel 3-4 times a year because we have the means.\n\nLast weekend my in-laws and Ashley along with my family came to our place for the Super Bowl.  My family is close by but Mark\u2019s is a plane ride away so they were staying with us.  We live in a high-cost-of-living city in the northeast of the US so we have a smaller place but we own it.  My in-laws took our guest room which doubles as an office and we put my SIL in our \u201cspare space\u201d which is an oversized closet I use as a \u201creading room.\u201d\n\nFrom the moment they arrived on Friday, my SIL was making negative comments about our lifestyle/things. She commented about her not having her own bedroom/bathroom, our building, the view, my clothes (not designer), our travel plans, our lack of children, only having one car instead of 2, the alcohol we provided, and the place we picked for dinner. She pretty much had something negative to say about everything.\n\nIt came to a head during halftime when Rihanna was performing. My brother asked which country she was from (because he forgot) and my SIL said St. Maarten and I laughed and said no, Barbados, then she knows because she and her husband own a home in St Maarten and I wouldn\u2019t know because we don\u2019t travel. I finally snapped and said she should ask her husband since he is actually the one that owns the home just like everything she has.\n\nThis is where I may have been the asshole, I asked her just how ironclad her prenup was (It is very secure and is an issue in their marriage) and then questioned her about her timeline on children. She got really flustered and then spent the second half of the game in her \u201croom.\u201d The rest of the night was a little awkward but no one said anything to me. I said goodbye to my PIL before I went to work on Monday but my SIL was \u201cstill sleeping.\u201d My husband thinks I was a little harsh but that she had it coming and my parents just thought it was out of character for me. SIL was pissed the whole trip home.\n\nETA: I just want to be clear that my SIL was loudly negative to anyone that would listen including our friends who met up with us on Friday, family dinner on Saturday and in front of my family on Sunday.
