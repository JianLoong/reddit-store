We go to each other's places frequently and sleep at the other's occasionally.\n\nSo last week, she slept over and woke up with period cramps. She asked for Ibuprofen, and because I only had two pills, I have her those. I don't really use Ibuprofen much, because I'm generally not very prone to pain apart from headaches, but those I use Thomapyrine for. \n\nApparently those two pills weren't enough for her and she got really upset at me. She said I should have Ibuprofen at home, that it's a basic necessity and that I should have it especially because she needs it frequently for her cramps. I don't see a reason for me to have large amounts of Ibuprofen at home, I don't need it. She's the one who does. \n\nNow I asked some friends and they said that since I know she needs it, I should have some at home for her. I feel like if she needs it, she should take it with her instead of me having to provide it.", "created_utc": 1695395512, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16pcv47/aita_fot_not_having_ibuprofen_at_home/", "score": 3063, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like you were going on a reasonable level there for a minute, you didn't have any because you didn't expect her to need it. Maybe if she knew she might need it she should have some in her purse. But then you just went off entirely into left field. What you should be doing is being considerate of your girlfriend. This shouldn't even really be a conversation. If she says how do you not have any ibuprofen in your house? You're response should be I'm sorry, I didn't know you needed it, I'll remember to get some so I can have it here for you. Being considerate to your partner is a huge step towards having successful relationships.", "NTA for the not having enough when you've never needed it much before.\n\nYTA for the \"Ner, you need it, YOU should bring it\".

She's an asshole for expecting you to have something you never needed before. You're an asshole for not even wanting to entertain the idea of starting to keep some for her. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it would be different if she was just a colleague or something.

Whomever happens to go to a supermarket or drug store should simply grab a bottle.\n\nHell, I've only *just* ran out and the last time I bought it was years ago. Even big bottles of the stuff are cheap.\n\nNote: what you take is caffeine, aspirin, and acetomenophan (tylenol if branded).

In fact, I've found acetomenophan useless for just about everything other than bringing down a fever.", "ESH - you weren\u2019t until the very end.

That way if she forgets to bring it some time you have some there.  \n\n\nI mean this is a person that you theoretically care for. So the question is do you want to help solve the problem or do you just want to be \"right\"?", "ESH\n\nI don't understand either of you. I always make sure to have medications ready with ME in case of emergency (there's a hefty first aid kit in my car, for instance, and one in my house). It costs like $4 for a generic bottle of ibuprofen to keep on hand. Both of you should hopefully be able to afford extras. You both digging in and being stubborn baffles me. Adults should be prepared for medical issues, emergencies, etc. I can't imagine being you and not having anything on hand - or her, for not keeping those things on hand, in her bag, herself.", "NTA - Thomapyrine's stated uses include 'period pain' [https://www.gurkerl.at/en-AT/16116-thomapyrin-tablets](https://www.gurkerl.at/en-AT/16116-thomapyrin-tablets) . You already had 2.. if thats 2 x 200mg tablets then this is a typical single dose. So you're initially NTA.\n\nBut.. the stuff is cheap. Go get a bottle and put it away. Maybe even buy some sanitary towels and tampons. Hell, get a hot water bottle. *Be a mensch*", "I mean she could maybe be reacting through her hormones. Which is understandable. Which is why she got so upset, But you make it sound like adding ibuprofen to your medicine cabinet will take up so much space. \"Keep large amounts of ibuprofen\" you can literally just buy a small bottle of 50 or 100 tablets for just a few bucks. And if she's the only one using it occasionally it will last a long time. It's really not as deep or as difficult as you're making it out to be. \n\nIbuprofen is known to be best for cramps in women, because it is a blood thinner. So it helps reduce the pain a lot more then other pain killers. Especially for women who experience lots of cramps or have a really heavy flow. That is most likely why she's asking for you to have ibuprofen specifically. Because it is the ideal painkiller for period cramps. So in regards to having them on hand for any women, it would be ideal.\n\nBut the attitude you're having about the whole situation is what makes YTA. women have periods that's just a fact. And if for some reason things don't work out with this one, it still wouldn't hurt to have a small bottle on hand just in case. But also as women myself, if I'm anticipating my period I do pack the painkillers if I know I'm going anywhere. But I'm only human and there are times I can be forgetful, and have forgotten the painkillers. Shit happens. Just get a small bottle. It's not that deep.", "ESH. \n\nPurely because when you love someone you have things they may needs especially if they come over often. It\u2019s common decency. \n\nIbuprofen is an NSAID, it works as an anti inflammatory and that\u2019s what helps with period pains as it\u2019s the muscles hurting. She may have been upset because she\u2019s in pain, some period cramps are absolute hell. More painful than a heart attack. Personally I had to take close to 1000mgs of ibuprofen a day just so it stopped hurting. \n\nIf she needs a lot it\u2019s hard to carry around everywhere, so to be kind to her you should get her a big arse bottle of it and just hold on to it incase she forgets her own or her period just pops up randomly as you can\u2019t track the timing to a solid T.", "ESH it\u2019s not your job to have it in for her but it would be thoughtful if you did.

It\u2019s not some massive inconvenience.

He was shopping and wanted to know what brand shampoo and conditioner I used, what deodorant, and what kind of tampons. When I asked why, he said he wanted to keep items I used at his place to make it more convenient for me when I stayed over. I knew definitively at that moment that I was wanted. That boyfriend later became my husband and the father of my children. Today, I keep sodas in the fridge that only my daughter\u2019s boyfriend likes. I keep other items for guests because I\u2019m a good hostess. It\u2019s sounds very selfish and uncaring not to want to provide for your partner. If the very idea of \u201cstoring\u201d a small bottle of ibuprofen bothers you, the lord forbid you share half a drawer for her clothes or anything else. Technically, you\u2019re NTA because you don\u2019t have to provide anything for your partner\u2019s comfort, but I hope she realizes you aren\u2019t the one and moves on to someone more giving of self.", "NTA.  If someone knows they regularly need something for their personal care, they shouldn\u2019t assume that everyone else will have that item on hand just because they frequently need it. Did she berate you for not having pads or tampons?  I am guessing she probably had those with her because she knew she needed them.  Likewise, she should have brought her own period pain relief.  Personally, I keep a small tube with a supply of naproxen, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen whenever I am away from home.  It is easy, and I have no need to bother anyone else for my needs.\n\nHOWEVER - if six months into a relationship you two are bickering about cheap ibuprofen,  I suggest that you may not be compatible for a long-term 7 month relationship.  Both of you sound like you need to grow up.  She needs to take responsibility for her own self-care. You need to consider making your place more welcoming to anyone who happens to visit - having a small stock  of pain relief, bandaids, cough drops and so on (even if you don\u2019t use any of it yourself) would make your place much more welcoming to guests.", "INFO: You've been together 6 months, so not very long - has she mentioned her cramping and requirements in the past? Or did she just kinda disappear? I'm trying to gauge if this is new information   / requirement to you or not.", "ESH\n\nTwo ibuprofen is the standard dose. If she needs more than that, then she needs something stronger and should bring it herself. \n\nBut your attitude at the end was a bit much. Would it kill you to keep some in the house?", "She shouldn't have gotten upset when there was nothing you could do in the moment, but are you really saying you refuse to buy some ibuprofen to keep at your house? Is it the money? Is it the principal? I mean come on dude. Have some understanding and show your gf you want to help, it's sexy when men do that. Keep making a big deal about such small things and you'll be making it way too easy for her to feel better understood elsewhere.\n\nMaybe not a complete AH but definitely working towards being one with this petty attitude.", "NTA- it would be a lovely gesture keep it on hand but it's not an obligation.\n\nSomeone grown enough to be staying over at a romantic partner's house is also grown enough to anticipate their own needs and prepare accordingly. \n\nIn all the years that I had a period,  I had both aspirin and ibuprofen in my purse, in my locker, in my glove box, in my desk...and,  whenever a relationship got to the point where I was sleeping over,  I kept a little make-up bag at his place with a stash of tampons, aspirin, ibuprofen & immodium.\n\nI get that it's frustrating for her to have cramps (man, do I get that!) and not have what she needs to ease them but taking her frustration out on you isn't cool.\n\n It would be different if she had *asked you* (politely) to run to the store for her- yes, a certain amount of mutual caretaking IS expected in a relationship- but what you're describing is not ok.", "ESH. \nIt\u2019s unreasonable for her to be upset with you for not having something you did not have a need for at YOUR house. \nHowever knowing now that she will occasionally need it why would you refuse to get some? Don\u2019t you want your girlfriend to be comfortable and be able to relieve her pain if needed when she\u2019s there? Seems weird to just want her to carry it around with her everywhere when it would only cost you around $20 to just get some for your place.", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have gotten upset you didn\u2019t have ibuprofen right that moment. On the other hand, not wanting to help your girlfriend when there\u2019s a cheap and easy way to do so is really dumb and makes you look selfish and uncaring.", "NTA, but the caring thing to do would be to get some for the future.", "I drink Coke.

A grown man having to have things explained to him. \n\nNo, you not having the pills at that moment doesn\u2019t make you an asshole and her grumpiness was probably from the pain.\n\nMoving forward now, if you think she should bring painkillers with her and you shouldn\u2019t have to? You\u2019re the asshole. Do you want a partnership or someone who\u2019s conveniently there for you to sleep with? Grow up for godsake.

But usually we have spares of tampons and pads or panadol, but of course that isn't always the case.\n\nIt's very rare that I don't have any  (tampons or panadol) at my house, only because I'm a \"stock piler\" kinda girl and almost always have them because I can't bare the thought of hitting that period pain on a thursday night and having to duck down to the shops! Haha.\n\nMy whole point was more, why does he have such a bad attitude to just stocking some Ibuprofen for his GF? He just seems to being a little bit of dick about it.", "If I'm in someone's house and start my periods, I would be grateful to get _anything_ - pads or tampons - to deal with it asap. I usually use menstrual cups, but I would 100% not throw a fit it there was an alternative.", "And it's not hard, and doesn't cost much money or space, to just have a little box with some of both. They don't even go bad. You just have to *have* them. It's like a passive feature to make half of my guests feel at home. \n\nI don't have a period anymore (due to my IUD), but a lot of my friends do, so I still have both tampons and pads in my bathroom. In fact, there's also some ibus in that box!", "She sounds like she is ***a pain***.\n\nFTFY", "Lots of people who have periods are frequently in pain. We don\u2019t all act like children who demand someone else supply us pain meds.", "EXACTLY. \n\nI think this was blown all out of proportion by OP's GF because she was hormonal and in PAIN. I'm sure once she's \"herself\" again, they'll be able to duscuss this rationally. And how much you wanna bet next time she sleeps over she brings her own to put in his medicine cabinet?", "I live on Vicodin, but I don\u2019t whine about and expect other people to take care of me.", "We gotta keep you at 666 bud", "Don't see where she apologized for being a pain during her pain. Sometimes it happens - we don't feel well and we snap. So STA", "Same but with hormonal IUD! I keep pads, tampons and other things just in case my guests might need it. He\u2019s not an AH for not having anti inflammatory meds, but it\u2019s an inconsiderate to not think \u201coh, I\u2019ll get some in case she needs it again\u201d. Like this woman has to clean around her toilet more often because a man use it and I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t think about that. She probably takes contraception that benefit him too and there\u2019s a financial and physical cost to that. \nDon\u2019t date a grown woman if you\u2019re not ready to learn and grow up too.", "Who, stores? Lol yes. I can buy thousands if I really wanted. But 500 seems to last quite a while.", "Yes, and in this case, 1000. Those 2 500ct bottles from Costco come together with a plastic handle connecting the 2 bottles.\n\nhttps://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-ibuprofen-200-mg.%2C-1%2C000-tablets.product.11489095.html", "Yeah, 6 mths in and she expects him to stock her preferred pain killer. I find that a bit much, at her age she should be carrying it with her because who knows when the pain will hit or where you'll be when it does. I don't get the her getting mad with him because they haven't been together very long at all.", "What if you like orange juice. Should you just bring over orange juice yourself? What about sitting on the couch with a blanket, should you bring your own? At some point in a relationship you should want to make your partner comfortable in your house and not have to rely on themselves to bring things over. That includes having things in your house that you might not use or enjoy, but your partner does. I don\u2019t think not having ibuprofen makes him an asshole but it would a weird hill to die on since it\u2019s like $10 for some and sounds like she would really appreciate it", "It's not whatever item she needs whenever. It's pain medication for periods. I think there's no way to be sure who's the asshole without knowing how the argument went down. He's certainly not an asshole for not having it that first time. But for next time? This is your girlfriend. If you know she needs something regularly, why would you not make it available at your house which you presumably want her to come to? It's Ibuprofen, it's not hard to buy or keep.", "Esp when she knows her period is coming. \n\nNTA OP", "I never leave home without acetaminophen and Sudafed.", "It doesn't mean she'll always be entitled, but this episode is worth keeping in mind. I wouldn't discount it.", "It was not long ago that young men would have actually had this covered ahead of time. Perhaps she had a father, or grandfather, or grandmother that has taught her to expect this? I know my elders taught me that a man does these things and is prepared ahead of time for a lady. And they taught my sisters to investigate, and avoid those who are not. Logical.", "100% agree. Him not having them before was whatever but this whole \"why should I store this\" is a red flag for me. If anyone, especially your partner, is at your home regularly and needs or wants something, be it ibuprofen, diet coke, teabags, mouthwash, or ketchup, why not just have it. It's not a big deal. Just buy some or let them store some there. Why it's that big a deal.", "Yes. The combo was first recommended to me by my dentist", "It\u2019s not really entitled to ask for it. It is really entitled to blame him for not having a bottle slowly expiring on his shelf just in case. Even if you\u2019re in pain. Your significant other is not your parent.", "Best answer ever. It\u2019s not that deep. When people are in pain, they can be grumpy and not always perfectly rational. No one is \u201cobligated,\u201d to have a preferred painkiller on hand for someone they love, but it is a thoughtful thing to do. This whole situation is so normal and low stakes. Maybe just err on the side of kindness, OP.", "I would like to hear her side of it.\n\nWhy not just go out and buy a bottle for her when she was in pain. A trip to the store is the least you can do for someone you care about.\n\nOP saying that it is her issue so why should he supply relief for her, speaks volumes about his maturity level.", "The thing is, he had \"only\" two. Considering two is the correct dose, it shouldn't have been an occasion to get mad at him.\n\nAfter that, If I was him, I would just get a small bottle next time I'm out just in case.", "Agreed. Being caring is high on my list for a partner and this would be a total turn off for me.", "Yeah if a man won\u2019t buy a bottle of generic pain killer I use bc I have chronic/regular  pain, he\u2019s not a man who cares about me", "She does need to apologize. The question OP is asking is why should he \"have to\" keep any for her at his house when he doesn't need it. Why is this tiny thing an issue for him? Because if you care about somebody and they need something and it takes the absolute minimal effort to provide that, why wouldn't you? Why is it a problem?", "I cannot believe anyone could expect others to be responsible for their ailments.", "FYI, ibuprofen is the best choice for gynecological pain(600-800mg, or 3-4 pills). A nurse changed my life with that advice.", "It\u2019s not about being secure enough to buy them/ have them around. It\u2019s about why he is expected to go out and buy things that he doesn\u2019t use? Can she not buy her own tampons and pads and leave them at his house? Can she not buy her own ibuprofen and leave it at his house? \nI don\u2019t understand why purchasing these items is on him.", "Responsible adults know how to take care of themselves, but also, if you know your partner is going to want to drink coffee when they stay over, why wouldn't you just get them some coffee so that when you invite them to stay at your house, they're comfortable? It's not something I'd expect a non-romantic house guest to provide for themselves, so why would I expect it of my partner?", "Responsible adults also are able to support their partners without posting on reddit about it.", "Is she supposed to be a mind-reader? How is she to know that OP uses other painkillers and not ibuprofen?", "Only if you're an ibuprofen user.  If you have other painkillers, in the house, it might not occur to you that it won't meet the needs of ibuprofen users in a pinch.\n\n I can understand if the girlfriend was caught off-guard while in pain, expressing frustration that her preferred painkiller isn't available. But, I would expect that this wouldn't be a continued sore spot between this couple. \n\nI would also expect that the girlfriend would bring some ibuprofen from her stash at home AND the boyfriend would pick up a small bottle to have on hand, just in case.  If they're discussing this beyond the day this incident happened, there is something else wrong in the relationship.", "Either that or Aleve. I had a GYN tell me to take two aleve or four Advil twice a day to help with the cramps and to start taking a day or two before I was expecting my cycle. Made a huge difference.", "OP has some growing up to do. When I was on the dating market I kept a couple of pads and tampons under the bathroom sink. Ibuprofen is dirt cheap.\n\nIt really only takes a modicum of effort and thoughtfulness to do the little things that will keep a woman happy.", "He did it to be thoughtful . We never did things out of reciprocity. We did it to be thoughtful of the others needs. I bought unscented  soap for him to keep at my place so his allergies wouldn't go nuts. Did I have to? No , did it make his life better, yes."]}
