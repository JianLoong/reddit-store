We go to each other's places frequently and sleep at the other's occasionally.\n\nSo last week, she slept over and woke up with period cramps. She asked for Ibuprofen, and because I only had two pills, I have her those. I don't really use Ibuprofen much, because I'm generally not very prone to pain apart from headaches, but those I use Thomapyrine for. \n\nApparently those two pills weren't enough for her and she got really upset at me. She said I should have Ibuprofen at home, that it's a basic necessity and that I should have it especially because she needs it frequently for her cramps. I don't see a reason for me to have large amounts of Ibuprofen at home, I don't need it. She's the one who does. \n\nNow I asked some friends and they said that since I know she needs it, I should have some at home for her. I feel like if she needs it, she should take it with her instead of me having to provide it.", "created_utc": 1695395512, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16pcv47/aita_fot_not_having_ibuprofen_at_home/", "score": 614, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like you were going on a reasonable level there for a minute, you didn't have any because you didn't expect her to need it. Maybe if she knew she might need it she should have some in her purse. But then you just went off entirely into left field. What you should be doing is being considerate of your girlfriend. This shouldn't even really be a conversation. If she says how do you not have any ibuprofen in your house? You're response should be I'm sorry, I didn't know you needed it, I'll remember to get some so I can have it here for you. Being considerate to your partner is a huge step towards having successful relationships.", "NTA for the not having enough when you've never needed it much before.\n\nYTA for the \"Ner, you need it, YOU should bring it\".

She's an asshole for expecting you to have something you never needed before. You're an asshole for not even wanting to entertain the idea of starting to keep some for her. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it would be different if she was just a colleague or something. But absolutely refusing to make such a simple and cheap accomodation for someone who you're supposed to care about doesn't make you look good.", "Just buy a bottle of ibufrofen ffs. Not a big deal.", "ESH\n\nThis is dumb. Generic ibuprofen is cheap as hell. You're both being an ass by digging in. Whomever happens to go to a supermarket or drug store should simply grab a bottle.\n\nHell, I've only *just* ran out and the last time I bought it was years ago. Even big bottles of the stuff are cheap.\n\nNote: what you take is caffeine, aspirin, and acetomenophan (tylenol if branded).

In fact, I've found acetomenophan useless for just about everything other than bringing down a fever.", "ESH - you weren\u2019t until the very end.

That way if she forgets to bring it some time you have some there.  \n\n\nI mean this is a person that you theoretically care for. So the question is do you want to help solve the problem or do you just want to be \"right\"?", "ESH\n\nI don't understand either of you. I always make sure to have medications ready with ME in case of emergency (there's a hefty first aid kit in my car, for instance, and one in my house). It costs like $4 for a generic bottle of ibuprofen to keep on hand. Both of you should hopefully be able to afford extras. You both digging in and being stubborn baffles me. Adults should be prepared for medical issues, emergencies, etc. I can't imagine being you and not having anything on hand - or her, for not keeping those things on hand, in her bag, herself.", "NTA - Thomapyrine's stated uses include 'period pain' [https://www.gurkerl.at/en-AT/16116-thomapyrin-tablets](https://www.gurkerl.at/en-AT/16116-thomapyrin-tablets) . You already had 2.. if thats 2 x 200mg tablets then this is a typical single dose. So you're initially NTA.\n\nBut.. the stuff is cheap. Go get a bottle and put it away. Maybe even buy some sanitary towels and tampons. Hell, get a hot water bottle. *Be a mensch*", "I mean she could maybe be reacting through her hormones. Which is understandable. Which is why she got so upset, But you make it sound like adding ibuprofen to your medicine cabinet will take up so much space. \"Keep large amounts of ibuprofen\" you can literally just buy a small bottle of 50 or 100 tablets for just a few bucks. And if she's the only one using it occasionally it will last a long time. It's really not as deep or as difficult as you're making it out to be. \n\nIbuprofen is known to be best for cramps in women, because it is a blood thinner. So it helps reduce the pain a lot more then other pain killers. Especially for women who experience lots of cramps or have a really heavy flow. That is most likely why she's asking for you to have ibuprofen specifically. Because it is the ideal painkiller for period cramps. So in regards to having them on hand for any women, it would be ideal.\n\nBut the attitude you're having about the whole situation is what makes YTA. women have periods that's just a fact. And if for some reason things don't work out with this one, it still wouldn't hurt to have a small bottle on hand just in case. But also as women myself, if I'm anticipating my period I do pack the painkillers if I know I'm going anywhere. But I'm only human and there are times I can be forgetful, and have forgotten the painkillers. Shit happens. Just get a small bottle. It's not that deep.", "ESH. \n\nPurely because when you love someone you have things they may needs especially if they come over often. It\u2019s common decency. \n\nIbuprofen is an NSAID, it works as an anti inflammatory and that\u2019s what helps with period pains as it\u2019s the muscles hurting. She may have been upset because she\u2019s in pain, some period cramps are absolute hell. More painful than a heart attack. Personally I had to take close to 1000mgs of ibuprofen a day just so it stopped hurting. \n\nIf she needs a lot it\u2019s hard to carry around everywhere, so to be kind to her you should get her a big arse bottle of it and just hold on to it incase she forgets her own or her period just pops up randomly as you can\u2019t track the timing to a solid T.", "ESH it\u2019s not your job to have it in for her but it would be thoughtful if you did.

It\u2019s not some massive inconvenience.

He was shopping and wanted to know what brand shampoo and conditioner I used, what deodorant, and what kind of tampons. When I asked why, he said he wanted to keep items I used at his place to make it more convenient for me when I stayed over. I knew definitively at that moment that I was wanted. That boyfriend later became my husband and the father of my children. Today, I keep sodas in the fridge that only my daughter\u2019s boyfriend likes. I keep other items for guests because I\u2019m a good hostess. It\u2019s sounds very selfish and uncaring not to want to provide for your partner. If the very idea of \u201cstoring\u201d a small bottle of ibuprofen bothers you, the lord forbid you share half a drawer for her clothes or anything else. Technically, you\u2019re NTA because you don\u2019t have to provide anything for your partner\u2019s comfort, but I hope she realizes you aren\u2019t the one and moves on to someone more giving of self.", "NTA.  If someone knows they regularly need something for their personal care, they shouldn\u2019t assume that everyone else will have that item on hand just because they frequently need it. Did she berate you for not having pads or tampons?  I am guessing she probably had those with her because she knew she needed them.  Likewise, she should have brought her own period pain relief.  Personally, I keep a small tube with a supply of naproxen, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen whenever I am away from home.  It is easy, and I have no need to bother anyone else for my needs.\n\nHOWEVER - if six months into a relationship you two are bickering about cheap ibuprofen,  I suggest that you may not be compatible for a long-term 7 month relationship.  Both of you sound like you need to grow up.  She needs to take responsibility for her own self-care. You need to consider making your place more welcoming to anyone who happens to visit - having a small stock  of pain relief, bandaids, cough drops and so on (even if you don\u2019t use any of it yourself) would make your place much more welcoming to guests.", "INFO: You've been together 6 months, so not very long - has she mentioned her cramping and requirements in the past? Or did she just kinda disappear? I'm trying to gauge if this is new information   / requirement to you or not.", "ESH\n\nTwo ibuprofen is the standard dose. If she needs more than that, then she needs something stronger and should bring it herself. \n\nBut your attitude at the end was a bit much. Would it kill you to keep some in the house?", "She shouldn't have gotten upset when there was nothing you could do in the moment, but are you really saying you refuse to buy some ibuprofen to keep at your house? Is it the money? Is it the principal? I mean come on dude. Have some understanding and show your gf you want to help, it's sexy when men do that. Keep making a big deal about such small things and you'll be making it way too easy for her to feel better understood elsewhere.\n\nMaybe not a complete AH but definitely working towards being one with this petty attitude.", "NTA- it would be a lovely gesture keep it on hand but it's not an obligation.\n\nSomeone grown enough to be staying over at a romantic partner's house is also grown enough to anticipate their own needs and prepare accordingly. \n\nIn all the years that I had a period,  I had both aspirin and ibuprofen in my purse, in my locker, in my glove box, in my desk...and,  whenever a relationship got to the point where I was sleeping over,  I kept a little make-up bag at his place with a stash of tampons, aspirin, ibuprofen & immodium.\n\nI get that it's frustrating for her to have cramps (man, do I get that!) and not have what she needs to ease them but taking her frustration out on you isn't cool.\n\n It would be different if she had *asked you* (politely) to run to the store for her- yes, a certain amount of mutual caretaking IS expected in a relationship- but what you're describing is not ok.", "ESH. \nIt\u2019s unreasonable for her to be upset with you for not having something you did not have a need for at YOUR house. \nHowever knowing now that she will occasionally need it why would you refuse to get some? Don\u2019t you want your girlfriend to be comfortable and be able to relieve her pain if needed when she\u2019s there? Seems weird to just want her to carry it around with her everywhere when it would only cost you around $20 to just get some for your place.", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have gotten upset you didn\u2019t have ibuprofen right that moment. On the other hand, not wanting to help your girlfriend when there\u2019s a cheap and easy way to do so is really dumb and makes you look selfish and uncaring.", "NTA, but the caring thing to do would be to get some for the future.", "I drink Coke.

A grown man having to have things explained to him. \n\nNo, you not having the pills at that moment doesn\u2019t make you an asshole and her grumpiness was probably from the pain.\n\nMoving forward now, if you think she should bring painkillers with her and you shouldn\u2019t have to? You\u2019re the asshole. Do you want a partnership or someone who\u2019s conveniently there for you to sleep with? Grow up for godsake.
