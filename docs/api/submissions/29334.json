Whatever damage the dog causes, they foot the bill. Gardening can be incredibly expensive, not to mention time-consuming. Honestly it\u2019s pretty appalling that the neighbor sees this as no big deal, or somehow not their fault. The dog shouldn\u2019t have been off-leash with access to your garden, and it shouldn\u2019t have been unsupervised allowing this to happen.", "NTA.  I'm a gardener and I feel your pain.\n\nNow put up a damn fence already.", "Owners are responsible for their pets. If they let the dog off-leash in an area where it can get into trouble, that is on them. The dog doesn't know any better but the owners should.\n\nNTA\n\nThat said, I'm not sure if this is a fluke where the dog should not have been able to get into your backyard (e.g. is it fenced but a gate was open?) so if it's a one-time mistake, you might want to weigh the cost of the mess against getting into an adversarial relationship with your neighbors. Maybe it's worth it, maybe it's not - only you will know for sure. It can sometimes be worse to have neighbors who are really passive aggressive and do lots of subtle, annoying revenge (even though the dog situation was their fault).", "NTA\n\nDogs don't know right from wrong, which is why it is the responsibility of their human owner to control their behavior at all times, either by actively supervising them, keeping them contained, or both.  \n\nAnd if their human owner fails in this responsibility and the dog causes damage, generally the owners are liable for that damage.  \n\nAlso, your neighbors should be more concerned.  Some common plants are toxic to dogs.  The next garden their dog chews up could prove to be an emergency.", "NTA\n\nThey are responsible for their dog. The dog wrecked your property. They \\*absolutely\\* should be footing the bill.", "NTA. They should absolutely pay. They are responsible for any damage caused by their dog. Period. It's not \"playful\" behavior to you-- this dog destroyed your hard work and source of joy. They should never have allowed this to happen and I am appalled that they are acting so nonchalant.", "NTA. Their dog is directly responsible for damaging your property. They are thus responsible for paying you back. The intent of the dog has nothing to do with it. Also, given their attitude, if you let it slide, there's a good probability it will happen again, and they will argue even harder that it was just an accident. Set the precedent now.", "Obvious NTA, but how are you defining property damage here? If the plants regrow with little to no intervention then you may not really have a case here.", "NTA- but you should absolutely take your neighbors to court. Document all the damages and calculate the cost, put up cameras as proof for future damages until you can get a fence.", "NTA, and any damage the dog makes is their responsibility. It's the same if their dog bit someone. God forbid if there was a plant that was hazardous for dogs and they had to see a vet ... they'd be right to your door with a bill! \n\nHowever, you have to decide if this is the hill you want to die on with your neighbors.

I would probably also remind them that many, many popular plants are poisonous to dogs and that they should definitely take extra care if their dog is inclined to eat them. \n\nBut as a fellow avid gardener who fostered dogs for several years, I want to remind you that most outdoor plants are pretty tough. I had a dog who loved to dig up plants and play keepaway with them in the yard. Another who would bury, dig up,  and then rebury her favorite treats under all my favorite shrubs. Plus, they manage to withstand any number of backyard creatures who generally do WAY more damage than the occasional rampaging dog. \n\nIf you're in an area that is coming to the end of its growing season, then I'd probably wait until Spring to really assess any damage.", "NTA\n\nId be mortified if my sweet, high-energy pup damaged anything at someone\u2019s home, but especially something that was a time-intensive labor of love for that person. Bottom line, if they\u2019re liable for damages based on the local laws, then they\u2019re obligated to pay. This isn\u2019t you being an AH. This is them being bad neighbors and bad dog owners. What if you used pesticides or had accidentally left some fertilizer out? THAT would be an accident. But them not monitoring their pet is neglectful, and in this case, comes with a bill as a consequence.", "NTA. \nObviously fix the fence. Then call Animal Services to come explain to the neighbor that they are responsible for their petthe same way if their pet was to attack a person. Even if it wasn't a garden, it could be any other item that belongs to you.\nMaybe a police report or animal control report will be enough.  Get things on record incase it happens again. \nEvidence is a key.\nPersonally as a dog owner and a gardener I let my dog get involved with my gardening and she would go sit in the dirt and pick little cherry tomatoes and baby cucumbers. \nI would just hate to see the innocent dog become the unintended victim along with your plants", "NTA Mistake or not you are out the time and money spent on your garden", "NTA.

Of course I'm sure it'll be a bit hard to estimate the cost of effort of the gardening unless the dog destroyed like the planting pot or something there. I hate to say this, but you might need some fences and gate for the garden. Of course just wait until the groundhogs come....", "NTA\n\nThe dog was unleashed.

Innocent mistake or not, why should you have to pay for it?\n\nIf my dog were to run in front of a truck (she did), I would be responsible for any damages to the truck (there were none) as well as my own vet bills (dog was fine, though). It's my job to keep my dog under control, and even though her running out was just her being a dog, it's still my responsibility.\n\nSame here.

They let their dog out unleashed and are responsible for his actions.", "Legally speaking, if your yard is not fenced in a way that any animal cannot have access, your neighbors have every right to demand evidence it was their pet. That being said, if you were present and saw that all the damage was caused by their unleashed dog, you can likely call animal control and file a report with the city/county/local enforcement agency if the owners don\u2019t pony up.

So much this. NTA", "I am absolutely a dog person but I agree, NTA.  Owners are responsible for their pets.  The dog should have had a fenced in yard or been on a leash.
