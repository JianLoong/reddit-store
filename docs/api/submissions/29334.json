Flowers trampled, shrubs chewed, it\u2019s a gardening nightmare.\n\nFuming, I march over to my neighbor\u2019s house to discuss the issue. They\u2019re nonchalant, claiming their dog is just being playful. I, on the other hand, am staring at my once-beautiful garden turned into a war zone.

Whatever damage the dog causes, they foot the bill. Gardening can be incredibly expensive, not to mention time-consuming. Honestly it\u2019s pretty appalling that the neighbor sees this as no big deal, or somehow not their fault. The dog shouldn\u2019t have been off-leash with access to your garden, and it shouldn\u2019t have been unsupervised allowing this to happen.", "NTA.  I'm a gardener and I feel your pain.\n\nNow put up a damn fence already.", "Owners are responsible for their pets. If they let the dog off-leash in an area where it can get into trouble, that is on them. The dog doesn't know any better but the owners should.\n\nNTA\n\nThat said, I'm not sure if this is a fluke where the dog should not have been able to get into your backyard (e.g. is it fenced but a gate was open?) so if it's a one-time mistake, you might want to weigh the cost of the mess against getting into an adversarial relationship with your neighbors. Maybe it's worth it, maybe it's not - only you will know for sure. It can sometimes be worse to have neighbors who are really passive aggressive and do lots of subtle, annoying revenge (even though the dog situation was their fault).", "NTA\n\nDogs don't know right from wrong, which is why it is the responsibility of their human owner to control their behavior at all times, either by actively supervising them, keeping them contained, or both.  \n\nAnd if their human owner fails in this responsibility and the dog causes damage, generally the owners are liable for that damage.  \n\nAlso, your neighbors should be more concerned.  Some common plants are toxic to dogs.  The next garden their dog chews up could prove to be an emergency.", "NTA\n\nThey are responsible for their dog. The dog wrecked your property. They \\*absolutely\\* should be footing the bill.", "NTA. They should absolutely pay. They are responsible for any damage caused by their dog. Period. It's not \"playful\" behavior to you-- this dog destroyed your hard work and source of joy. They should never have allowed this to happen and I am appalled that they are acting so nonchalant.", "NTA. Their dog is directly responsible for damaging your property. They are thus responsible for paying you back. The intent of the dog has nothing to do with it. Also, given their attitude, if you let it slide, there's a good probability it will happen again, and they will argue even harder that it was just an accident. Set the precedent now.", "Obvious NTA, but how are you defining property damage here? If the plants regrow with little to no intervention then you may not really have a case here.", "NTA- but you should absolutely take your neighbors to court. Document all the damages and calculate the cost, put up cameras as proof for future damages until you can get a fence.", "NTA, and any damage the dog makes is their responsibility. It's the same if their dog bit someone. God forbid if there was a plant that was hazardous for dogs and they had to see a vet ... they'd be right to your door with a bill! \n\nHowever, you have to decide if this is the hill you want to die on with your neighbors. Their wilful ignorance is ridiculous, but it might be better to just move forward. Your choice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Letting their dog run wild on other's property is not an \"innocent mistake\"", "One time mishap or not, it's still their dog that caused the damage so of course they should pay for the repairs. Would you let someone who hit your car off because it was the first time it happened? NTA", "NTA. Sue them; they have a responsibility to keep their dog off your property. Also warn them the next time the dog is in Your garden, animal control gets called. Good fences make for great neighbors", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nYou're within your rights to insist that they pay and to escalate it as far as you want. I would probably also remind them that many, many popular plants are poisonous to dogs and that they should definitely take extra care if their dog is inclined to eat them. \n\nBut as a fellow avid gardener who fostered dogs for several years, I want to remind you that most outdoor plants are pretty tough. I had a dog who loved to dig up plants and play keepaway with them in the yard. Another who would bury, dig up,  and then rebury her favorite treats under all my favorite shrubs. Plus, they manage to withstand any number of backyard creatures who generally do WAY more damage than the occasional rampaging dog. \n\nIf you're in an area that is coming to the end of its growing season, then I'd probably wait until Spring to really assess any damage.", "NTA\n\nId be mortified if my sweet, high-energy pup damaged anything at someone\u2019s home, but especially something that was a time-intensive labor of love for that person. Bottom line, if they\u2019re liable for damages based on the local laws, then they\u2019re obligated to pay. This isn\u2019t you being an AH. This is them being bad neighbors and bad dog owners. What if you used pesticides or had accidentally left some fertilizer out? THAT would be an accident. But them not monitoring their pet is neglectful, and in this case, comes with a bill as a consequence.", "NTA. \nObviously fix the fence. Then call Animal Services to come explain to the neighbor that they are responsible for their petthe same way if their pet was to attack a person. Even if it wasn't a garden, it could be any other item that belongs to you.\nMaybe a police report or animal control report will be enough.  Get things on record incase it happens again. \nEvidence is a key.\nPersonally as a dog owner and a gardener I let my dog get involved with my gardening and she would go sit in the dirt and pick little cherry tomatoes and baby cucumbers. \nI would just hate to see the innocent dog become the unintended victim along with your plants", "NTA Mistake or not you are out the time and money spent on your garden", "NTA. Small claims court if they continue to refuse to pay. Sorry about your garden, that really stinks!", "NTA", "NTA; it\u2019s their responsibility to pay for damages caused by their dog, regardless of how or why dog was in the yard. That\u2019s how liability works, and it\u2019s one that becomes yours as soon you get a dog.", "NTA, their pooch should have NEVER been on your property at all in the first place. Of course I'm sure it'll be a bit hard to estimate the cost of effort of the gardening unless the dog destroyed like the planting pot or something there. I hate to say this, but you might need some fences and gate for the garden. Of course just wait until the groundhogs come....", "NTA\n\nThe dog was unleashed. They're responsible for the carnage of your beloved garden. They decided to let him wander unrestrained.", "NTA. I love dogs, and the way you take good care of your dog is to train them well and know where they are at all times.\n\nOne of these days that dog is going to eat something poisonous if they don't accept responsibility.", "NTA they are irresponsible pet owners who\u2019s negligence caused damage to your property and for that they are libel", "In his eyes, their admittedly beautiful golden retriever can do no wrong. I\u2019m not a dog person to begin with but this is the first time I\u2019ve put the foot down.
