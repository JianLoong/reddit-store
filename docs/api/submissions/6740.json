{"id": 6740, "submission_id": "105wvit", "title": "AITA for requesting my vegan step-daughter pay for her vegan-specific groceries?", "selftext": "My [34M] wife [36F] have three kids together, plus my wife has a daughter [16F] from a previous marriage. My wife\u2019s ex is in my step-daughters life, but not active nor financially supportive whatsoever. Both wife and I work full time.\n\nTo be clear, have always treated step-daughter as my own daughter and only refer to her here as step-daughter for clarities sake. In real life just call her my daughter. Have pretty much raised her since she was 8.\n\nStep-daughter has decided to go vegan for environmental reasons, which I\u2019m supportive of. Problem is that she\u2019s requesting very specific vegan foodstuff, eg, meat substitutes and foods no one else in the family would otherwise eat. Her siblings definitely have no desire to eat vegan. I cook all the meals in our family (wife hates cooking) and I\u2019m fine with preparing vegan alternatives for her, but as you can imagine the cost adds up, especially when it\u2019s just for one person.\n\nAs my step-daughter has a part time job I\u2019ve suggested she pay for the vegan specific food she wants. So she wouldn\u2019t be paying for normal veges/fruit etc but anything no one else in the house would eat she pay for. I think it\u2019s a good way to also teach her budgeting and being more self-sufficient. Especially since she is the oldest and will be going to college soon.\n\nStep-daughter is really upset and thinks I\u2019m punishing her for being vegan (not the intention). Wife has suggested I\u2019m singling her out because she\u2019s my step-daughter (I\u2019m not and this actually REALLY upset me as I\u2019ve only ever done my best to support her and treat her as my own). I\u2019d do the same for any of her siblings.

I totally get where you\u2019re coming from, but with her being a minor I think there should be a little more effort to provide food for her while still supporting her beliefs and choices based on them.\n\nI\u2019m also vegan, and me and my parents made what I feel was a pretty fair deal when I made the switch that may also work for you!\n\nLike what you mentioned, I was encouraged to eat lots of whole veggies and grains, which would be covered because the entire house would also eat them. Then, if I wanted meat/cheese/egg replacements, I paid the extra part of the cost. So like, let\u2019s say pre-vegan I liked chicken nuggets. If I want vegan nuggets but they are $2 more than regular chicken nuggets, I pay the extra $2 and my parents covered the amount they normally would have if it weren\u2019t a vegan substitute version", "Tricky. While I understand your intent here, and also mindful that vegan alternatives are more expensive, the purpose of buying the groceries is to feed your daughter. That's still on you.  While she's the only consumer of those alternatives, she's not eating into your meats or other meat products. So unless she's wasting the alternatives (if she consistently has leftovers which gets thrown out), then I think you should still pay for them.\n\nWhat might be more reasonable is to see if she's able to step up and help cook or prep veggies for the family. I can see how her diet likely adds much more time to your chores. And if you're visiting an extra store or two for alternatives, you can ask her to help with the task of going grocery shopping. It's part of being in a household, but also a lesson for her in being more independent.", "NAH. Give her a budget and ask her to prioritize which items she\u2019d like. Invite her to shop and cook with you so she understands the implications of her requests and work with her to make it possible for her to eat vegan without breaking the bank.", "NAH\nI see you and your daughter's side in this, certain vegan items can be super expensive and you're a fairly large family.  \n\nIf your daughter wants the expensive meat substitutes daily, she should contribute, when I was that age if I wanted something different to the household, I'd go to the shop and get what I like.  \n\nFor you, surely this is a chance to broaden the family's pallette and meal options?  What's wrong with the 5 bean chilli for the family? Why not make the tofu curry?  It would surely be beneficial to research some meals that could fit into your budget which would show support for your daughter", "INFO: Is this the only time your wife has accused you of singling out your stepdaughter?", "NAH although my parents won\u2019t ask me to pay for a food choice I made, I often will keep some choices to myself and buy them myself with my own money (either saved allowance or part-time money). I\u2019m already having everything for free and they\u2019re spending a shit ton just to keep me happy, so if they said something is too expensive I\u2019d just let it go and think of another solution. \n\nDepends on the food though, if SD is asking for simple products then you\u2019re the a-hole, but if it\u2019s like really specific products that are purely made for vegan diets then nta", "Why not involve her in cooking and meal-planning? How about the whole family eating vegan (think pasta with a vegetable sauce; chickpea curry, meat-free burritos etc) a couple of days a week? Maybe think beyond pre-packaged fake meat, which isn\u2019t environmentally friendly and can be full of trans fats, salt, sugar and preservatives? Look at whole grains, legumes, nuts etc and get a decent vegan cookbook.\n\nNAH. I\u2019m vegan; my stepson and husband are not. We mostly eat vegan because I do most of the cooking.", "NAH for considering it TBH. It\u2019s really easy to go vegan when someone else pays and prepares the food. She\u2019s almost an adult. And it is a choice, not requirement, which affects your finances in hard economic times. I think there\u2019s a creative solution here. For example, you make several meals a week that are vegan (or mostly so, which everyone tries together) without needing specialty items and she pays for her own additional snacks. Obviously you should keep basic staples for her to snack on, but anything beyond that is up to her. I like the idea others have suggested of involving her in budgeting and shopping. Come up with an allocated $$ that you\u2019ll cover for vegan alternatives and it\u2019s up to her to prioritize what she wants each week, with coupons etc as a way to get more bang for her buck. \n\nI went vegetarian my senior year of high school living with a single dad who prepared a standard american diet. I took over shopping and cooking and he was a great sport. I only lasted a semester or two in college before eating meat again but I learned a lot! Basically, create a situation where she\u2019s somewhat responsible for what she eats, and is less likely to fold the second she moves out and doesn\u2019t have someone else to do that heavy lifting.", "INFO: How are the cost of her vegan foods not offset by the fact that you are not buying her meat anymore? From my experience meat proteins are around the same cost as vegan proteins", "INFO: Are you able to afford the specific foods she wants without her financial help?", "NTA \n\nThis seems entirely reasonable and an excellent lesson to teach.", "NAH \n\nI can\u2019t really call it. I get it can be expensive to buy vegan specific foods, (I am one so I should know) especially if you\u2019re step daughter is excessively asking for shop bought packaged / vegan targeted foods everyday like tofu, tempeh, falafel, vegan labelled snacks etc then that sure could get expensive.  \nDo you cook on request for your other kids? If so then you need to suck it up. If not then perhaps you could research some of the vast range of vegan recipes / foods available that are cheaply made using beans, lentils and pulses, you could compromise with your step daughter re how much of the family food budget will go towards \u2018vegan specific\u2019  processed foods mentioned above, the rest should be included in family budget. Help her realise she can be vegan without falling into the trap of just buying stuff that says \u2018vegan\u2019 on the front, read the labels and you might see lots of things in your cupboard suitable for her already", "YTA - Kid is 16 and you should pay for her food.  That said: Tell stepdaughter she has to shop every week with you and she has to create a budget plan for her desire to go vegan.  It should be more effort on her part than simply throwing a switch and sitting there like you were the waiter and chef.", "NTA, \n\nI had a plant based diet for a couple of years, it was easier to buy my specific foods than rely on family members or partners etc. I was a bit hamstrung due to a soya allergy/ intolerance so I had to be really careful that a helpful person didn\u2019t accidentally buy something that would shut me down for a couple of days. Plus you can make some really good food out of normal veggies etc so you aren\u2019t really restricting your daughter. Maybe pick her up a vegan cook book to help her out? That\u2019ll be a great way to show support.", "INFO: Is she asking you to buy things like tofu, seitan, and vegan mayo? Or is she asking you to buy things like impossible burger patties?", "I would go in half or 2/3s for her stuff. That way she learns to budget but it isn't taking away her entire income", "Turned vegetarian on Christmas Eve, aged 9 (sorry, Mum). My parents bought plenty of stuff for me until I got a job at 16 and it was only when I started spending my own money that I realised the extra cost I'd been causing. They never made me feel guilty or a burden, but I decided then to just have whatever they were having, just without the meat. I'd have veggie sausages or a Quorn roast occasionally, but having pasta without mince and a cooked dinner without the chicken did me absolutely no harm.\n\nIt might be worth coming up with recipes that you can all eat, with meat added for the family. More roast vegetables and salads or pasta, etc.\n\nThat way you're not buying extra for every meal but can a couple of times a week or something?", "NTA if she\u2019s going vegan she needs to understand that there\u2019s costs involved with specific foods. This is a learning experience. Your wife and her playing the \u201cstep \u201c card is grossly unfair. Should she continue this lifestyle in college she\u2019s in for a rude awakening because vegan food is very expensive.", " NTA. But I would say a good compromise is maybe you pay part of it, like a half and half situation. If I wanted special food when I was growing up that wasn't part of the budget, my mom and stepdad would have me pay them for it, or part of it. I agree it's a good learning opportunity on how to budget for groceries. It definitely helped me in the long run. (I was your step daughters age when this happened, I'm now 34 and never resented my parents for it. )", "NAH I stopped eating meat when I was 12 or so. My mom, who worked full time and made dinner every night for our family of 5, let me know that if I wanted something not on the menu, I would need to make it myself.\nShe prepared me by teaching me to cook, buying me some vegetarian cookbooks, and making sure there was always at least a meat free side (I ate a lot of mashed potatoes, very happily).\nThis was in the early 1990ies, so vegan meat substitutes were not really an option.\nIt was really a great experience for me (I am the oldest kid). She WOULD buy tofu/tempeh/veggies as requested, but she wasn't buying soy milk or Boca burgers.\nI had a steady babysitting income, and so I could supplement if I chose to.\nI think you are both at a potentially good learning opportunity, for me, it also helped reinforce how much work my DID. It also gave me agency over my food (the rule in our house was \"you get what you get and you don't get upset\", with special acknowledgement for members of the \"clean plate club\")...", "Info: do you buy things for others in your family that are special requests? Ex: Does you or your wife get specific snacks that only you or her likes?", "NTA- vegan substitutes are an elitist food that only rich people can afford. Having her contribute financially to this is a life lesson and she will quickly realize how expensive these foods are and how much of a privilege it is to choose to be vegan. She will quickly realize she is spending a large amount of what she earns on basic foods so to expect her parents to 'splurge' is unreasonable and spoiled. You will only raise an entitled person. Given that she's 16, she probably had no idea how much food costs, especially healthy vegan foods, so it would do her well to learn. My response would be different if it was just vegetarian however vegan is a chore and expensive af. Your wife who doesn't cook is also being naive. \n\nP.s. I was a vegan/ vegetarian for a long time. Your daughter will also need supplements and other stuff which she should also be purchasing on her own or contributing to in the very least. If she's old enough to make this decision, she's old enough to absorb the costs/ consequences. In the least, she should be aware of her extreme privilege and be grateful that she even has a choice. I would imagine if you were a single mother of 4 working 3 jobs she would not be demanding you buy her specialty expensive alternatives.\n\nI would personally be pretty firm on this and I would also ask her to contribute to the cooking and learning to prepare these foods for herself. Are you going to raise a daughter who is vegan and can't feed herself?", "As longs as it's only the difference, not the full cost. So if vegan cream cheese is a dollar more than the normal stuff than you only charge her a dollar. It goes both ways, she's not eating the not vegan stuff so those cost need to be deducted from whatever bill you want her to pay.", "NAH\n\nThe thing is that the commercial vegan substitutes are often overpriced and not good, either for you or for the environment.   \nYour stepdaughter needs to learn to be vegan without commercial vegan foods.  She doesn\u2019t need oat milk or almond milk or any of that, nor does she need vegan meat substitute or vegan cheese.  She needs to learn how to plan a diet around normal food, not commercial substitutes.  \n\nWhat you, your wife and your stepdaughter need to do is sit down and have a conversation.  State that you\u2019ll pay for any of the normal food that she wants, including beans, lentils, rice, etc, and she can research how to make her own vegan burgers, etc.  \n\nIf she wants commercial vegan substitutes though, she can cover the costs of those. \n\nYou need to participate in the recipe search, and assist her in making the vegan things at home, and probably substitute some of them for the family.  Learn to make them edible.", "NTA if she insists on the meat substitutes and pre-made vegan cheese and baked goods.  All of those things are very expensive.  There are existing (already mostly) vegan cuisines and if she's serious about being vegan, she needs to learn to make her own vegan cheese and baked goods.", "NTA there are loads of vegan recipes with beans and veggies and that she could eat for free, vegan meat substitutes are not very good for you and are expensive.

You are willing to prepare low cost vegan options, which is more than most parents would for a 16 y.o. who suddenly decided to make an extreme dietary change.  If she wants the substitutes or other items, she can pay for it. She needs to learn that choosing a non standard diet is going to have difficulties, cost being the first hurdle", "NTA but I think this would go over better if you made a list of what she wants to eat and how much it costs and how much is budgeted for groceries.\n\nThere are so many options available other than fake meat/meat alternatives. \n\nMaybe *work with her* on doing meal planning and budget it out.", "NTA.\n\nYou've made it clear that you are more than happy to pay for items that fit into a vegan diet-fruits, vegetables, grains, and beans.  However, vegan alternatives can be quite costly; if she insists on eating meat replacements, she should have to pay for at least part of that, as she will be the only person using it.  For the time being, I'd suggest maybe a 50/50 split on any items that are for her use only.  I'd also make her learn some vegan recipes that she can prepare on her own, while learning some simple ones yourself that could work for a family. You should not have to shoulder 100% of the responsibility for her choices-she is definitely old enough to contribute herself, especially as her choices are creating more work.\n\nThis is a recipe that I make for our family; we're not vegan, but this is a tasty meal and I do like incorporating meat-free days into our weekly meal plan.

If it's stuff only she'll eat - and she can afford to contribute to it - then I think it's a good way to teach her how to budget her money before she moves out for college or something in a few years.", "Given all of the circumstances, no, NTA. You're not expecting her to pay for *all* the food that falls into the category of vegan, just the specific specialty vegan substitute items that she wants. And wants is the key word here; your stepdaughter doesn't *need* to have them to follow a vegan diet.", "INFO, how much discussion have you done on how to accommodate her? \n\nLike, if she had allergies or religious reasons, would you have tried harder to accommodate her?\n\nAlso, will you be subtracting meat and dairy for her? You now can buy less of that.\n\nI\u2019d say generally that this is a bad hill to die on. She will pay, she will resent you and she will be doing forensic accounting on who gets more resources spent on them.", "Would you buy your other children expensive cuts of meat if they requested them? While you eat ground beef would you let other children chose steak or lamb? Probably not so asking her buy or partially pay for expensive meat alternatives seems like a fair plan. Maybe give her a budget of $x that you spend on each person a week for meat and let her chose what to spend that amount of meat budget for herself. Tell her we spend  this amount each week on meat for each individual in the family. You may have that amount to spend on vegan meat for the week. Plant based meat products are very expensive and with managing a good budget giving vegan child unlimited budget seems like poor choice. It is her choice to be vegan but it is not your job to provide unlimited funds for her to stick to being vegan.", "I\u2019m not sure you will end up seeing this given the amount of comments. Our house definitely isn\u2019t Vegan so I can only speak to the little I know as I do all the shopping. What I would do if I were you is patrol the local stores, mine has meat subs on sales every time I go. Freeze them or do meal prep as they are on sale. I get the thought behind making her pay for food that feels \u201cextra\u201d but I\u2019d venture a guess that you guys get the other kids snacks they like which is kind of how you have to look at it.

It isn't like one of your other kids is asking you for something more expensive and special and you are just refusing to do it for her. You put food on the table and if she doesn't like it and needs something else than she can get it herself.

Assuming also that you, parents, don't interfere in the money she gets, then she should be able to buy the things she likes and wants with that money: And this is where I say NTA. Being vegan, in this case, is not for an essential/health reason, but because she simply has certain ideals and thoughts that differ from the rest of the family. As I presume you continue to provide the things she actually needs, if she has the will to make such a radical change, that could affect the family's profits negatively, then she has to bear the means and consequences of her own decisions. In fact, thinking otherwise strikes me as narcissistic, in a certain way. However, it is obvious to me that you as a parent should support her and help with some purchases (like the cheap grocery stuff you can buy by the same price as that of the meat you'd give her), but to finance the whole change when she could do it herself? Nah.. Trust me when i say that you would end up raising an entitled person lol.", "Nta but as with most of these there is a realistic compromise.

Am sure there are options.\n\nI'm sure having a mature conversation about what you'll pay for and what is reasonable will go over better than singling her out and punishing her, which is definitely what you're doing.

I buy dairy free for him.", "YTA  I'm a vegan and it's not that much more expensive, plus you need to realize it's only one person eating it so you can freeze the rest and get a few meals out of it.", "YTA.  She's a minor and there's other ways to deal with this.  If she didn't have a job, would you be making her pay or getting a job?  If she had a dairy or protein allergy would you be making her pay?  Cause this sounds like because she has a part-time job it's a convenient way to get out of having to deal with her dietary changes.\n\nEveryone can eat vegan food, but not every vegan can eat every food, so it is singling her out when technically every single person in your household CAN eat the food she buys.  Their preference not to is beside the point here - it is food and they have no restriction against eating it.  If you made otherwise vegan meals where every person in the household could then add their protein of choice and made everyone pay for their protein of choice then you're treating people equitably (i.e. you make spaghetti marinara and then everyone cooks their protein of choice to eat along with it).\n\nThis would be an excellent learning opportunity for everyone in the household for meal and budget planning and incorporating some vegan meals that everyone would like so you're not basically cooking two different meals or buying a lot of specialized substitutes.  Lots of things are just naturally vegan and/or can be made from whole foods to be a satisfying meal without meat substitutes such that the meat substitutes (and meat) are a sometimes food rather than a daily food.  For example, lentils are cheap and can be used as a ground beef substitute in dishes like sloppy joes, cottage pie, and chili that the entire family can enjoy.  Vegan margarines like Earth Balance and soy or other non-dairy milks can be easily substituted in cooking and baking to make things the entire family can eat and these days are sometimes even cheaper than their dairy counterpart.   Then the number of specialized food products can hopefully be decreased to help ease the overall food budget.  \n\nYour local library should have some books on veganism and vegan cookbooks that you and your stepdaughter can check out and do some research together with the family on things you would all like to try and how she can transition safely to veganism without resorting to being a junk food/processed food vegan.", "YTA but I know you're obviously trying not to be mean.  I think you should just get her the food, like the whole ordeal seems like there is a subconscious element of weirdness because she isn't your bio daughter and because of her new diet. From a vegan, and a step-child, it would hurt my feelings on both counts, and just seems counter productive in general. \n\nY'know the saying \"don't sweat the small stuff\"? This is one of those moments. Also, the expense isn't much different, I say this from fifteen years experience of co-existing with meat-eaters.", "YTA. Parents pay for their kids necessities which includes food.", "YTA \n\nYou charging the other kids for non vegan snacks and extras that are not part of dinner? No? Then don't be an asshole and charge your kid for meat alternatives. You can freeze beyond/impossible and there's meat alternatives in the frozen food section. Literally plenty of ways to keep costs down. \n\nBe better.", "If you are going to go through with this and make it a lesson in budgeting, you need to ensure that you are deducting the cost of the meat eggs and dairy that she is no longer consuming. I'm going with NAH for the time being, but you need to think very carefully about how to make this fair. You can't just slap on a vegan tax without properly doing the numbers on it.", "YTA.\n\nSome vegan substitutes can be expensive, but it's hardly bank breaking expensive. (Also, the reason why meat and dairy are so cheap is because it is heavily subsidised. Just fyi.) \n\nAlso, you are saving the cost of buying meat for her. Do you calculate the difference? Or are you expecting her to pay for it all?\n\nAnd what if a meat substitute happens to be cheaper than the meat you buy for a meal?  The fair thing to do would be to make the other children pay for their protein sources then.\n\nHave you tried to find cheaper protein sources? Together with her? Tofu is quite affordable and delicious, if you know how to prepare it! And what about beans, lentils and chickpeas? Falafel are vegan, too. So many options. \n\nFood budgeting is important and always a good thing to learn. You could use this as a teachable moment and go on an affordable culinary adventure with her, try out new recipes, cook together etc. Being excited about stuff your kid is excited about is a great way to show support and strengthens the relationship.\n\nInstead you're being a AH about it.", "YTA, but it's totally fine to say that the expensive meat alternatives are only for once a week thing, for example. You wouldn't buy steak every day either, I assume. Tofu isn't that expensive, and beans are downright cheap and delicious when you prepare them right. Dried soy (textured soy protein and soy chunks) is really, really cheap and you can use the mince for the whole family as you would mince meat. As long as you flavor it well, no one can tell the difference, and it'll save you money.", "YTA. If she had an allergy that required her expensive food you'd take care of it too. Nothing wrong with cooking vegan for the entire family once a week or so to buy something in a bit bigger package.", "YTA, meat is expensive as is chees.  Have you considered using the remaining vegan stuff for the rest of the family on some days? Personally, I live alone and am able to manage buying and using vegan protein scources on a student budget. \n\nDo let her know if a specific item she requests is very expensive and explain you can't buy it often for that reason. I know this is hard in the beginning. You'll get more used to which vegan products are and which aren't affordable. Here in the Netherlands, eating vegan is often cheaper than eating meat.\n\nIn any case, she is to young to put the responsibility of paying for a healthy and balanced diet on her. Teaching her to budget is great, but you should let her do it with things she cares about but are oke if she messes up. Including protein in a childs (or anyones) diet is not optional.\n\nBtw, is she taking supplements? Vegans need that! B12 and iron for example.", "YTA.

I think the best way you could go about this is budget out your grocery spending, rough out how much you\u2019re spending per kid , and give her that much money to buy her own groceries (or have a say where that money goes while the grocery shopping happens.) \n\nYou spend a lot of time talking about how much you love your (step) daughter \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean anything to us.

Meat is more expensive generally but it\u2019s hard to do vegan for 1. A lot of the better cheaper options(like bean, lentils etc) are hard to cook in single serving size, so while theoretically it\u2019s possible for you all to eat a vegan carb like rice, and a vegan veggie, if you are thinking she could just replace the meat for a meat alternative that is going to be expensive. Even though it\u2019s generally pretty easy to swap out eggs and dairy in a lot of sides, it might be easier and cheaper for her to make a batch of curry, or lentils or whatever on a Sunday and portion it out. This would also be healthier most likely. But I don\u2019t think she should be paying for all her own food. I think if really want to be Nickel and dimey you have to add up the weeks\u2019 meat cost and divide by number of people and give that to her. So sit down with her and figure out the budget for her needs, and if she wants to go out out and buy extra then she can pay for it. As a side benefit you get to spend relatively positive time and attention on her and show your support while you get her to see in numbers what is reasonable. Maybe she can even make something once a week or so for everyone. Good luck!", "YTA\n\nIf she is a minor in full time education, you should be paying for her food.

It seems that you aren't taking into account that she isn't eating the animal products that you buy anymore. Since she is no longer eating those, you should need to buy smaller quantities, and therefore spend less money on those items. Not sure of your location, but where I live, the vegan meat alternatives are often priced similarly, or even cheaper than, the actual meat. Same for vegan dairy alternatives. Dairy and eggs are getting expensive in my area. The vegan alternatives are actually often cheaper. Do you make the other kids pay for their own food when they request specific things, like a favorite cereal, snack, etc? I also don't really understand how so much food is getting thrown out? Vegan meats are usually frozen and last a long time. Dairy free milks are usually available in small sizes. I understand if she is requesting overly expensive items, or larger quantities than what she really needs, but if they are similar prices to what you normally buy, I don't see the issue.

My wife\u2019s ex is in my step-daughters life, but not active nor financially supportive whatsoever. Both wife and I work full time.\n\nTo be clear, have always treated step-daughter as my own daughter and only refer to her here as step-daughter for clarities sake. In real life just call her my daughter. Have pretty much raised her since she was 8.\n\nStep-daughter has decided to go vegan for environmental reasons, which I\u2019m supportive of. Problem is that she\u2019s requesting very specific vegan foodstuff, eg, meat substitutes and foods no one else in the family would otherwise eat. Her siblings definitely have no desire to eat vegan. I cook all the meals in our family (wife hates cooking) and I\u2019m fine with preparing vegan alternatives for her, but as you can imagine the cost adds up, especially when it\u2019s just for one person.\n\nAs my step-daughter has a part time job I\u2019ve suggested she pay for the vegan specific food she wants. So she wouldn\u2019t be paying for normal veges/fruit etc but anything no one else in the house would eat she pay for. I think it\u2019s a good way to also teach her budgeting and being more self-sufficient. Especially since she is the oldest and will be going to college soon.\n\nStep-daughter is really upset and thinks I\u2019m punishing her for being vegan (not the intention). Wife has suggested I\u2019m singling her out because she\u2019s my step-daughter (I\u2019m not and this actually REALLY upset me as I\u2019ve only ever done my best to support her and treat her as my own).

Occasionally I'll make an exception and cook a spaghetti-squash when I make pasta-oriented meals.", "I'm not going to make an AH judgment here, but propose a question/alternative solution... To me, this is like when an older kid gets a job and you make them start paying for snacks that they want. Once my kids reach the teen years, they often like to buy snacks (usually junk food, but not always), and that comes out of their own money. For two of them, it's almost always been stuff like soda, chips, and candy. One of them had a hobby of bodybuilding, so he would use some of his own money on stuff like protein powder.\n\nOn the other hand, one of my kids went through a phase where he was exploring Islam and wanted to eat halal, so we made sure that at least three meals a week met those dietary requirements. Beyond that, if he wanted to eat something special, he had to cook it himself. (And since we eat very little pork, it was often 6 or 7 meals a week that we made that met his requirements.)\n\nMaybe try doing something like, having the whole family do a Meatless Monday and a Vegan Thursday - two days a week where the entire family eats vegan. It's an opportunity for the entire family to show support for her and work together to learn some new cooking skills. On those days, YOU pay for the vegan stuff because it's part of a FAMILY meal. If she wants special food on OTHER days, try to always have something available as part of the meal that she COULD eat, even if it's small - a veggie-based side dish, a bread/pasta thing, etc. If she chooses to make a different entree for herself, she can pay for THAT herself, but by offering two meals a week that fit her dietary needs, AND by offering at least one dish each night that meets her dietary needs, you're clearly signaling that you're trying to offer support to her veganism in a reasonable way.

Yes, she shouldn't have to pay for her own food but she should understand that the vegan alternatives are often much more expensive than the normal product. Then again, she should use her part time earnings to enjoy her time in high school and save up for her future. Best case scenario here is a compromise: maybe she uses less substitutes or covers part of her food costs, not all but just a part of them.

She may not understand why it is as big of a problem as it is", "YTA a (minor) child should not pay for their food no matter what they eat. Why not start making meals together, have lots of veggies, grains, seeds and nuts etc and learn how to cook all kinds of different beans. They are a really good vegan protein.

A bag of dry soy mince costs like 3 euros where I live and I can make food out of that for a month (it just needs plenty of oil and spices since it has no flavor otherwise).

This worked really well - it gave me independence and helped me learn budgeting, but didn't cut me off from sharing food or cooking for others/being cooked for, and I was never upset if someone used some of my food (though they'd ask before doing so), as it was ultimately from the family budget.

In particular, if you buy dried beans and rehydrate them yourself, the cost per serving is negligible. And tofu has such a bad rep (amongst many meat eaters), but it's the chameleon of food.

Vegan substitutes are expensive and are also a treat as your step-daughter can still eat fruits, vegetables and grains etc.\n\nI\u2019m assuming most of your meals are meat, potato and a vegetable kind of thing in your household so you could be nice and buy a vegan pack of sausage and separate them individually in freezer bags and whenever you make sausage for the family, throw a vegan one on as well as this is what my mom does as a vegan herself. If your step-daughter wants vegan ice cream or vegan cheese etc., I feel that she can buy it herself as my mom doesn\u2019t even buy that stuff for herself with regular grocery shopping and only has it as a treat every now and then.\n\nAnother idea is to incorporate meatless Monday\u2019s as a family and make a dinner that all can enjoy.

Perhaps you and your daughter can explore recipes together? Instead of buying meat substitutes, make them in batches and divide them into smaller batches and freeze them.", "NAH, but perhaps the two of you can use this as a bonding experience as you are the one cooking. Things like vegan meat replacements are expensive, but dried lentils and beans are a very cheap protein source. Perhaps the two of you can figure out some cheap and easy vegan recipes using those?", "NTA.", "NAH. This could be a chance to start teaching her about budgeting and about how to get the most for your budget. For instance, if she starts eating a lot of hummus, it would be worth it to buy the ingredients to make it from scratch (dried or canned chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon). Have her do the math and figure out how much more hummus she can get for the cost of a few containers of it. Likewise, she can learn how to make a batch of veggie burgers or falafel to freeze or can batch cook beans, quinoa, etc. If you save and freeze veggie scraps, she can use them to make broth. Even if she does something like this once or twice a month, it will help to make her new diet more affordable.\n\nLikewise, think about meals where the whole family can eat basically the same thing. Maybe the rest of the family has teriyaki chicken with rice and stir fried veggies. She could have teriyaki tofu with the same sides. Everyone can have tacos, just with  a slightly different filling for her (but beans and corn are relatively affordable). Maybe the whole family could eat a vegan meal once or twice a week?\n\nIf she\u2019s willing to play an active role in her new diet, you should continue to pay for her groceries. She\u2019s a minor in your care, and at her age I\u2019m guessing she wants to use her money from her job to save for a car or for spending money. If she expects you and her mom to do everything and expects you to pay for processed meat alternatives all the time instead of learning how to cook some basics, then it might be time to ask her to chip in. \n\nYou might encourage her to check out some vegan cookbooks from your local library.

There are ways to eat vegan that don't require all the expensive special substitutes. If she is serious about this, she should also learn how to do it without always relying on those.

If she was 10, it would be different but 16, if you cam drive a car, you can learn about paying to partially support yourself whether she's vegan or not", "NTA, I stopped eating my parents cooking after I got my first job. I didn't like their food so I bought my own groceries.", "NTA. Apply this to anything else. Would you be if it were sneakers? You can provide them, but expensive brands are out of your budget... it would be normal for a parent to set THOSE limits and ask the teen to make up the difference.", "NAH (I\u2019m allergic to eggs, so I\u2019m very familiar with substitutions and having to either change the meal for everyone, cook separate items, or be left out)\n\nFirst, completely aside from the vegan diet she absolutely needs to be involved in both budgeting and prep/cooking so she can make good decisions as an adult - 16 is plenty old enough and needs to learn these skills. Also younger kids can pitch in to help as appropriate - don\u2019t make her help now etc then let younger ones coast later, she\u2019ll be resentful and view it as you punished her for being vegan. Additionally in her case, it takes a bit more work and planning to ensure a healthy vegan diet. It\u2019ll be easier once it becomes routine for her, but she still has to own her choices - if she\u2019s not willing to make the sacrifices and do the work it takes, she needs to take a hard look at her decisions.\n\nIf the substitutes she\u2019s requesting are roughly the same as the options bought for the rest of the family (ex: if vegan burger is roughly same as beef burger) it would be blatantly unfair to make her pay - you\u2019d be paying the same to feed everyone, just buying two items instead of one. As a parent you are 100% responsible for providing food, but you aren\u2019t obligated to bend to every whim of your kid either - both of you should be responsible and respectful.\n\nIf they are considerably more expensive then first see if there\u2019s another suitable option. Basically look at it as name-brand vs generic concept: if the off-brand vegan burger is close to meat cost but she\u2019s asking for Beyond Meat then you need to have a reasonable conversation about expectations and budgeting. If she still insists on the pricey option when there\u2019s a good cheaper option, she should pay the difference. (I\u2019d say the same if we were a generic ice-cream house but my kid demanded name-brand that cost the same for a pint as a gallon of the cheap stuff) Same goes for something like Just Egg vs tofu - tofu isn\u2019t as nice for a scrambled egg sub IMO, but significantly cheaper and still totally fine - take the tofu or pay the difference.\n\nSometimes there may not be a good option at equivalent price - in this case, I would discuss it with her to establish a middle ground between you accepting the higher cost and her being respectful of how much she\u2019s consuming. Ex: if cheese subs are all pricey, she needs to understand she can\u2019t decide to put cheese on every food she eats, and in turn you accept the higher cost so she can occasionally have a cheeseburger with the family. I think of this as a small financial concession from you to support her and she\u2019s going to have to make sacrifices like this a lot at gatherings or restaurants (and possibly at home if she can\u2019t budget for them as an adult) so she needs to accept it as part of the vegan package.\n\nAs for the extra work, it\u2019s not fair for her to expect significantly more labor from you to make separate meals without pitching in extra labor herself - if the sub can easily be make for everyone then consider that (ex: use applesauce instead of eggs for pancake batter), if it\u2019s little/no more labor cooking then no big deal (vegan burger vs meat, but she should pitch in more on dishes if using more pans etc), if it\u2019s twice the work she should be pitching in significant help in prep/cook/wash somewhere (ex: making two lasagnas - have her prep unique ingredients and layer her own)", "NTA.

Saying nobody else will eat Impossible meat or Almond milk without giving it a try isn\u2019t fair. If you try it and nobody else in the family likes it then she can cover those things herself or you guys can work out a small amount per month that you\u2019ll give her and she\u2019ll have to budget it herself.", "There have been other similar posts but from a mothers perspective and it was the minor was an AH. A man posts and now it\u2019s OP is the asshole because she\u2019s a minor. Like what?? I think NTA because food is way cheaper as a non vegan (I personally was a vegan and vegetarian at certain times in my life) and those accommodations can be done since she has a job. She can either pay half of her own vegan ingredients or she can cook for herself", "NTA you make decisions for the household, she needs to get a job and budget . Time to learn the consequences of actions and decisions you make", "I feel that your compromise is fair, my mom and I are vegetarians so my dad just buys meat for himself, but I think you could meet her half way and provide a small budget for her and guide her through her finances. Plus, grains aren\u2019t that expensive! I think she could also research other alternatives that don\u2019t hurt the bank so much. NTA", "NTA. Part of veganism or any niche diet is understanding the extra effort (and often money) it takes to invest in that lifestyle. If this is the choice she is making, she needs to recognize the results of that choice and decide if it is worth it or not. Shes old enough for that. Frankly i think you\u2019re being more than accommodating.", "NTA\n\nShe's 16 and has a part-time job. You're not expecting her to buy all the groceries herself, just the things that only she'll eat. It's a prime time to start teaching her budgeting. Especially budgeting for her specific diet. Eventually, she's going to have to buy all her own groceries. You aren't saying you don't support her. Many parents stick with the \"you eat what I made or you starve\" but you're willing to support her. Not everyone can afford to accommodate different dietary needs. You're willing to buy food that she can eat but if she wants very specific and expensive vegan food, she can get it herself.", "I agree with this \u2014 but to take it further, the house should be stocked with basics that are vegan friendly like canned beans and frozen as well as fresh veggies. Some vegan staples should be included like veggie burgers, oat milk, and nuts which you can buy inexpensively in bulk at Costco and those are enjoyable even for non vegans. Then above providing her staples, she can shop for any extras that she wants. But that said, you can\u2019t buy other kids preferred treats or snacks or fancy things like steak and not similarly splurge on vegan specialty foods for her.", "Thats totally reasonable.  Never even thought of that but yeah", "This is a great idea. Also perhaps instead of contributing, OPs step daughter could cook a vegan meal for the whole family (or at least a side dish to share) once or twice a week too.  She is in theory going to go to college or go adult somewhere in a few years and especially as a vegan, cooking is an important skill.  It's not going to kill anyone else in the family to eat a couple vegan meals a week.\n\nIt's easy to do vegan stir fry, soup and bread, roasted vegetables that could be served with rice or pasta, baked potatoes with vegan and non vegan toppings (I like salsa on baked potato), fajitas (even if the non vegans add some cheese)", "Vegetarian, here, and I love this suggestion! It also promotes Step-Daughter learning more about cooking, which could be another way for her and OP to bond, and for her to realize that this is not a Vegetarian vs non-veg issue.", "Very smart idea!", "This seems like a great idea", "That solution is both fair to you *and* good parenting, because it gave you a chance to become familiar with the extra costs associated with a vegan diet before you were responsible for your own household expenses.", "I kinda see where you\u2019re coming from with this otherwise wonderful compromise, but as someone that had to start working at 12 to buy clothing necessities (underwear!) because my parents were neglectful, I think this is difficult and stigmatizing. \n\nI agree with the daughter that it feels like a punishment. \n\nThere are better ways to teach budgeting than to dangle necessities over a 16 year old\u2019s head.

I'm \"almost vegan\" (it's for health reasons) or \"functionally vegan\" I guess you could say, and a whole lot of my daily diet consists of food anyone could eat. (Veggies and grains, rice, etc).

There is a solution here that shouldn't introduce any significant added expense.", "I think it would be a good idea for OP to take the amount they saved by not buying her meat/eggs/dairy and let her buy her vegan substitutes with that money", "This was the comment I was looking for - as a parent you need to provide food for your child.

There are better ways to eat vegan. Sure, it\u2019s more convenient just to swap in the expensive substitutes so you aren\u2019t making a separate meal. But it\u2019s less expensive and much healthier to learn how to make vegan food that doesn\u2019t rely on the pre-made, processed substitutes, which kind of defeats the point of being vegan. If she\u2019s serious about this and wants to be vegan once she\u2019s out of the house, she needs to learn how to do it in a healthy way.

There is a lot of nutritional considerations that need to go in to having a healthy diet, especially if you are restricting whole categories of nutrient dense foods. \n\nAs parents, OP and his wife should be including their newly vegan daughter in her food choices,  because she is 16 and this is a good time to learn about cooking if she doesn\u2019t do that already. She also needs support to make sure she is actually getting balanced nutrition, and they should probably get in touch with someone who can help guide them through this diet change in the way that will keep the daughter healthy.", "First, every kid by the time they are a teenager should understand their basic nutritional needs. This shouldn't be a mystery at the age of 16. But many people share a diet within their whole household, so instead of learning the specifics of their dietary needs, some people just learn their nutritional needs by example of what's routinely served to them. \n\nHowever, anytime someone, regardless their age, undertakes an enormous shift in their diet, the healthy and responsible thing to do is to learn not just what foods are included or excluded from the diet but how to ensure their meals satisfy all of their nutritional needs. \n\nBeing a professional chef is great, and having a degree is great, but are you a Registered Dietician? Whether you are or not, why would you advise people to not teach their kids about healthy eating practices? That's all I'm suggesting here. Make sure that she learns healthy eating practices with a vegan diet in specific. I'm not suggesting some sort of oppressive dietary control without justification. \n\nThere are numerous articles, studies, and professional healthcare recommendations that support the need for anyone following a restricted diet to ensure their nutritional needs are being fully met. I didn't think that would be controversial. I can find those links if you need, but a simple Google search will show them as well.", "Oh god. Daiya. It tastes like McDonald's styrofoam from the 80's. Weirdly, their boxed mac and cheese is good. My whole family loves it. Kind of spendy at $4ish a box, but it's a decent full meal if you put vegetables in it. \n\nAnother good thing in houses with mixed eating styles is to make things vegan until you add the meat.

Much younger than 16, for most kids, is not. \n\n As you said yourself, it's about age appropriate-ness. The other kids should definitely be treated the same when they reach that age, and she should be told that now. Their age is very important here too - getting say, an I year old, to budget a portion of their weekly food that is all cooked by a parent anyway is impractical and unnecessary, and wouldn't have great results for most kids. My opinion isn't really based on dietary choices, but age, maturity, and healthy real world experiences. She's growing up and making her own choices, and it's important to acknowledge and support that.\n\nEdited to add that I do agree that adding in some regular vegan meals for the whole family, that everyone likes (and trying things out together to find out what those are), like your husband's family did, is a really good approach, and I think would work well in combination with her having her own part of the budget (and no part of these meals coming from that).", "Had a quick look at burger patties at my local shop website, it was about $2-3 per meat patty and around $6 for one of the vegie ones", "Unless you buy it from a butcher you can't choose the quantity of meat you buy, unlike water bottles you can't go up to a 6 chicken breast pack and take out 5 and pay less, in this situation he'd have to buy those 6 and then buy on top of that an alternative version.

I was going to make veggie wraps and my mom wanted chicken on hers - so instead of just the two dollar pack of provolone cheese, I added in a $6 pack of lunch meat.

She can definitely be vegan without meat and cheese substitutes, but that requires more planning and cooking on her part. If she has a budget for additional items that she can add for flavor or texture, she\u2019ll quickly realize that vegan convenience foods are too expensive for most people to make the foundation of their diet. Either she\u2019ll learn to use these foods sparingly like most vegans do, or she\u2019ll have to change to another diet that will still be environmentally conscious. Neither choice is ideal, but not giving her the option and making her buy all of her own vegan alternatives is just weird.\n\nOP, YTA.

Especially because those items (vegan meat substitutes) are just as expensive, if not more so, than meat options. \n\nHe\u2019s preparing her meals. He\u2019s doing her shopping. She doesn\u2019t have an allergy or special food needs. She\u2019s made a lifestyle choice.

Animal protein and cheese isn't inexpensive. \n\nOf course logistically it is hard to cook different meals but that is a completely different issue. \n\nThere are lots of \"neutral\" snacks like chips, nuts, popcorn etc. that are vegan as well.\n\nAlso if you are in the USA check out a place like Trader Joes which has loads of vegan stuff - even prepared/frozen meals that are relatively inexpensive and you can stock up there.", "NAH - Vegetarian here.

An Indian cookbook saved me when I wanted something different and wow was it good! Other family members were more than happy to eat the curries and other dishes. \n\nAlso, there are some dishes she can learn to make herself.

You cook the same food for everyone in the house. If she (or anyone else) doesn't like the common food, they are free to cook for themselves something else.\n\nSo, rather than taking that kid's hard earned money from a poorly paid part-time, she can learn that having special eating habits comes with the responsibility of cooking it yourself (which will definitely help her when she gets to college).", "Nope, I did that once I gave up meat.

Also, because my parents wouldn\u2019t purchase things like sweets when I was young, I was used to buying such treats myself anyhow.\n\nDepending on how your family eats regularly, maybe one option would be to offer to pay for vegan staples (tofu, rice, lentils, chickpeas, and so forth) and any highly processed \u201ctreats\u201d (desserts, snacks, and I\u2019d personally include meat substitutes, which is a treat to me) could be on her.

It does take more planning, though.", "This seems reasonable.  Another good idea is that you two should sit down and plan a vegan meal together each week and cook together for the entire family.

I think it's nickel and diming a kid at that point considering that meat is relatively expensive and the alternatives are only a little more than the meat. A healthy vegan diet also doesn't replace all meat with faux meat alternatives, it should be primarily lentils, beans, etc. Those are not as expensive as meat by a long shot.\n\nGetting her involved in the cooking will help her to look after herself in the long run without punishing her for having a different philosophy about food.", "My main concern here is, will OP apply similar logic to the other children?

OP has a child develop an allergy, perhaps to something for which alternative foods are more expensive (gluten, for example). Do they need to pay the difference?\n\nI get that it sucks needing to pay for more expensive items to accommodate a specific diet. But it seems OP's logic is coming down to the fact that the items aren't used by others in the house. But obviously the latter doesn't make any sense: food is a consumable. Would OP cover the vegan items if another member of the household started to want to consume them?", "Yeah. Don't make her pay, help her understand that vegan shopping costs a bit more. If chicken nuggets cost $5 and vegan nuggets cost $7.59 dollars, then it's useful to understand how 3 sets of chicken nuggets equals 2 sets of vegan nuggets.

Your child needs to learn about shopping for produce and cooking if they will be vegan for the long haul so you can start that now. It's not a punishment it's an opportunity for everyone to learn, you have to frame it positively. \n\nA big part of being vegan is being conscious of your relationship with the ecosystem, so they should be in for learning about food, where it comes from, etc.\n\nRice, potatoes, and beans are generally the keystone of this diet, and the expensive fake meat stuff is only for rare occasions and to help transition while you learn new recipes.  Remind your child that fake meats are processed foods, generally, real food is better for the earth and your body.\n\nGood starting points:\nRice and beans (cans are easier than dried beans) or burritos \nPasta Primavera \nRoasted potatoes or cauliflower with spices\nRice pilaf \nVeg stir fry\nThrow it all in soup\nFrozen veg and fruit is cheap and healthy, don't overlook them! You should always have frozen peas!\n\nAlso, remember that instant Rice and grains prepackaged in boxes are generally massively overpriced. Get a big bag of real Rice and a Rice cooker for $20.

As long as the daughter eats all of it, why does it matter whether the item is technically shareable with the rest of the house? The household will purchase less of the items the others are eating, and a small portion of what the daughter will eat.\n\nThought experiment: what if OP has three kids and all three of them decide to take on a vegan diet. Now a plurality of the household wants these vegan products. By your logic, the rest of the family can eat it, so should OP be obligated to absorb that cost because he's been outvoted?\n\nYou might have a point if OP's daughter wanted a 30 lbs tub of some specialty product that she can't consume before it expires. But like..just buy a smaller portion? This isn't rocket science. The food will all get eaten, regardless, if you buy everyone what they want.", ">Except all of those are about things that aren't a choice.\n\nThe leading example is absolutely a choice.\n\n>You can easily be a vegan without buying expensive vegan substitu\u00e9s for meat and animal produce.\n\nI mean, a non-vegan can subsist on very cheap foods as well.

Would it be cool for OP to say their celiac kid can't buy the expensive GF breads?

Meat substitutes may run them an extra $50 every two weeks so $100 a month. That's a significant amount for some people. And the cost of food is rising.

They\u2019re expensive. It would be akin to cooking lobster or nice steaks for dinner every night. She should understand that those things are special extras and not the foundations of a vegan diet. If she wants the special extras all the time, then yeah I think she should contribute to the cost in some way.", "I buy frozen impossible burgers at Costco for $15 for 10.  So I\u2019m paying $1.50 per burger.  Veggie black bean burgers are about $1.00 per patty.  Equally on par with regular beef.", "But OP's family aren't vegetarians with someone else wanting meat to incur a meat expense, like you and your family are. OP's family is going to buy and eat the meat anyway, regardless of whether the daughter chooses to remain vegan or not. Neither the daughter nor the rest of the family should be forced to simply change their entire diet. The rest of the family is going to have meat, but the daughter won't, so replacing the meat for the daughter without forcing the others to eat the same meals as her is not a matter of replacing the \"difference\" of the \"extra $2\" between the cost of the normal food and vegan food, because that would only work if the vegan food was replacing the normal food.\n\nI will explain: Let's say for example that a box of meat burgers costs $8 and a box of impossible burgers costs $10. In this example, let's say the family meal is burger sandwiches and fries. The rest of the family will be eating meat, the daughter will not be eating meat. If you force the rest of the family to eat the vegan burgers, then the \"difference\" in costs incurred is only $2, because they only bought one container of burgers. But if you let the rest of the family choose what they want to eat -- the meat burgers -- then the extra cost is actually $10, because they had to buy the vegan burgers for the daughter in addition to the meat burgers for themselves. And you can't just buy one or two burgers, right? You also can't buy a mixed box of burgers for meat and vegan diets. So they had to buy two containers of burgers for two diets instead of one container of burgers for everyone, thereby raising the food expense. That's $18 for the two containers, going by the example, which means a \"$2 extra difference\" is not the full extra expense. So even if the daughter pays \"the difference\" of $2 because the vegan burgers cost $2 more than the meat burgers, the parents are still paying $6 more than they otherwise would have. \"But it's only $6, what's $6?\" you might be asking. Well that was just for the burgers in the example. What if the family likes a particular brand of hamburger buns, but it's made with milk? Then you need different bread for the daughter to eat, which is another extra expense because you're still multiplying the amount of food purchased. AND all of that was just for *one meal*. There are three meals in a day, or 21 meals in a week. $21 x $6 (if it was a consistent difference every meal) is an extra food expense of $126 a week.\n\nThat's an extra expense equaling -$504 a month, according to this example.\n\nWhich means the family pays an extra $6,048 more a year, according this example, for food that only one person (in an at least 5 person family) will be eating.\n\nI wonder how many extra work hours that is?\n\nOr, yeah, to keep costs down, you could just force the rest of the family to go with vegan meals that they don't prefer because, well, the daughter is vegan and this way she can just pay the difference in price for meals. Which, if the whole family was vegan except for one person, would outrage the vegan community if the whole family had to change their diet for the one meat eater. Therefore, I think the family should continue with their normal meal planning, and follow other people's suggestions: only the ingredients that are substituted is what the daughter should pay for. In full. Because she is literally the only person in the family who will be eating it.\n\nAnd I think Agreeable_Metal7342's family should pay for their extra meat if groceries are shared and they're not the ones buying the groceries. Shrugs.", "I went vegetarian and it is much less expensive than eating meat. Beans, lentils, vegetables are all cheap as chips. Substitute meat can be pricier, but so is actual meat. Substitutes for meat (i.e. not trying to be meat) that I use e.g. tofu, bean patties are less expensive than meat. My most expensive regular items in my grocery shop are dairy items, which a vegan will not be consuming, so even cheaper still.\n\nIt may have been more expensive to go vegan a few years ago, but at least where I am, that is certainly not true any longer.", "If dad's son wants spaghetti for dinner as opposed to the tacos that they were planning to make, is he going to pay for that?\n\nNote that the entirely separate meal is a replacement, not an extra cost out of the blue. Have to factor that in as well.", " I have a vegan friend who gets his hot dogs shipped from the US while in Europe. Because he wants to protect the environment . Yeah no", "I think it might depend on where you are, if you're getting protein replacements. For example: 10oz container of vegan cheese substitute (going with the cheapest brand where I live) is $3.99, while a 12 oz container of full dairy cheese (again, cheapest brand) is $1.99. Vegan egg substitute is $4.99 for 12oz, but an 18 pack of eggs is $4.89. Tofu, on the other hand, is $1.79 a lb raw (which makes it the cheapest protein and you can bet I've been taking advantage of it, lol), but if it's processed in any way (seasoned, pre-portioned, etc) it's $6.99 for 7oz (which I find unreasonable; I can get a 1.5 lb bag of raw chicken tenders for $3.99 a lb while a 1.5  lb *at the same store* of fried/grilled/baked chicken tenders is $5.99--a *much* smaller price gap). A 10oz piece of \"raw\" tofurkey is $13.99, raw turkey breast is $1.99 a lb. So--where I live, and (presumably) where OP lives, going vegan is much more expensive than continuing to eat meat if you want a varied diet. \n\nSource: I work in a grocery store and I'm responsible for making sure the price tags are correct.", "And since she's only eating for one with the portions, surely the vegan substitutes should last longer (most meat substitutes can be frozen just like regular meat) meaning the amount it adds to a weekly or even monthly shop shouldn't be that much more. \n\nAlso I know this isn't what OP wants to hear at all, but I would say maybe the rest of the family should give the vegan options a try. No idea where they're based, but here in the UK I've started eating less animal protein for specific health reasons and have found that there are very few items where the vegan option is noticeably worse/different than the non vegan one. Most notably being vegan cheese which is horrendous. The rest is pretty much down to an art by this point. So if the big issue is regarding buying duplicates of everything, one fairly easy option is to try one meal using vegan ingredients and see if anyone can tell the difference. \n\nI know it's often seen as a worse option, hence OP saying \"certainly\" none of the rest of the family wants to eat vegan (with the implication of why would they, it's awful) but we've come a long way in developing this stuff, making it much, much better than it was when the first attempts were made.", "I can't call him T A because he says he will cook her a separate meal to support her new dietary needs.

If OP's daughter had food allergies would he ask her to cover the difference in price between foods?  Or if she were lactose intolerant and needed lactose free cheese and milk, would she have to pay for those?   True one is a choice and one isn't, but how much money are we even talking about here?

It can even be less expensive than a meat-based diet. \n\nHowever, it sounds like OP\u2019s daughter may be planning to base her diet around these convenience foods which isn\u2019t affordable, nor (like you wrote) is it particularly healthy due to the amount of processing these foods receive. She needs to learn this herself. 16 year olds are old enough to hear about family budgets, and they are old enough to start making their own informed choices. Give her a budget, and let her choose the foods that fit into it. She won\u2019t be eating the family\u2019s regular snacks nor should the other family members be eating her vegan alternatives.

I have since moved out of the house and now buy my own groceries, but was in a very similar situation as OP and his daughter. I decided to go vegan as a teenager when the rest of my family wasn\u2019t and requested that my family accommodate it. My dad had me sit down with him to figure out what meals could be made vegan with minimal extra work (like tacos for the rest of the family would have ground beef and mine would have beans, so the only thing that is added is heating beans). This made me feel respected and did not add much additional work for him, but also made me put effort into coming up with meal ideas so he wasn\u2019t doing it all. I also started cooking one vegan meal a week for my family, but this isn\u2019t necessary. I will also note, since it is relevant to my next point, that none of these meal alternatives used vegan-specific foods. So, if the additional couple dollars for vegan meats and cheeses is a challenge for OP\u2019s family, there are lots of cheaper ways to support a vegan diet. Beans are extremely affordable and full of protein, cheese can be essentially cut out of a diet, soy milk isn\u2019t much more expensive than real milk and it lasts longer. There are lots of ways to actually decrease the family\u2019s grocery spending while providing vegan food.

As long as the daughter eats all of it, why does it matter whether the item is technically shareable with the rest of the house?

YTA. Buy her food, get her to cook and meal plan with you. Minimize the vegan \u201cmeat\u201d products. They\u2019re a treat so you have a fun thing when others are having burgers or hot dogs, but they\u2019re not normal food. Maximize legumes, seeds and tofu which are WAY cheaper than meat, and nuts which are closer in price to meat. Many vegan milks are quite cheap, figure out her favourite and look for sales or buy a non-perishable kind in bulk. Vegan food is not inherently more expensive. \n\nMake things like lentil soup for the whole family. It\u2019s cheap AF, incredibly delicious and nourishing and it\u2019s something you can all share.

So if multiple people wanted to go vegan, then they will be making cut backs elsewhere to accommodate for the increase spending.\n\nSo your logic here is that either everyone makes a dietary change, or no one does?

So, is some quantity okay, then? Or does she never get to have any sort of meat substitute? Why do the other kids get more expensive foods (meats themselves) in normal quantities, but she can't even have a smaller portion of meat substitute?\n\nIf they cost twice as much as actual meat, shouldn't it be reasonable for her to at least be able to get them half as often?\n\n>because of their lifestyle choice which is basically what she\u2019s asking.  \n>  \n>You are glossing over the fact that he is making her vegan specific meals and not making her pay for that only for specific items above that that she is demanding.\n\nIt's funny that you've completely disregarded answering how OP's daughter is different from our scenario where a theoretical son is consuming excessive amounts of expensive sources of protein for muscle gain as part of his \"lifestyle choice\", but accuse me of \"glossing over\" details. ;)\n\nI digress...\n\n>You are glossing over the fact that he is making her vegan specific meals and not making her pay for that only for specific items above that that she is demanding.\n\nSo it certainly seems like she's not asking for an excessive quantity here. If others in the household are allowed to get more expensive non-vegan foods/treats on occasion, why can't the daughter?\n\n>They are already doing that. She wants more variety than what she\u2019s already given.\n\nWhat's wrong with wanting a bit more variety? If non-vegan children wanted a bit more variety, most people would have no problem doing that within reason. Variety in moderation seems...very normal?\n\nDo you never let your kids have a nice steak, either?\n\nI suspect if OP was vegan and inhibiting his children from having \"more expensive\" things like steak (because the raw food diet is cheaper), folks here might be singing a different tune, eh?\n\n>\\-Thought experiment: what if OP has three kids and all three of them decide to take on a vegan diet.

In this hypothetical scenario you're *agreeing with*, the costs are *even higher* for OP. So..is this not actually about cost, as you've stated?\n\nDo you not see how wildly illogical your response here is? Money is fungible. You're acting like a household has to decide between buying one thing or the other, as though you can only be a \"steak house\" or a \"chicken house\", because you can't buy...half of one and half of the other.\n\nI'd gently suggest that it seems like you might have some strange bias here blinding you to what seems like it should be some common sense.", "Not everyone has a Costco or big box type store to buy from.

The one box of vegan patties will also last the 4 meals and still only cost $10.
