He may fully intend of having children but he wanted to do some things while he has the passion and money to do it, before making another commitment (a child). Unlikely, but he also might want to finish the car project to sell it on for a higher price vs selling it unfinished, which could be used for his future family. But that's not stringing someone along, that prioritizing. All we can definitely say is he prioritized the car over having children. \n\nHe totally could have been using that as an excuse, but to say he is lying to his partner purely based on that one comment of wanting to finish his car project is a bit far fetched.", "So then when they call the next time and ask about it again what do you say?
