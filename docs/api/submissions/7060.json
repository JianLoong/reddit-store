Finish my car build (needed 3k) and 2. Finish paying off my remaining loans (another 3k). 2 weeks after starting the 2nd job she says she wants to break up, I try reasoning and explaining what I've been doing but in her mind, I was just being nice to her and never wanted kids. \n\nA couple of days after the split we talk and I explain everything again; she said she needed time and space to think it through even then doesn't think she'll be able to change what she thinks now and possibly will never see that future of us anymore.\nRoommates were understanding and allowed us to swap living areas. \nWe are now living separately and I had a talk with the landlord who gave me a green light to break my part of the lease, I haven't told them but I know they wouldn't be able to afford the rent without me and I don't want to hurt them like that but I'm at the end of my rope and miserable and prefer to just move back with the old roommates before I met her. If I leave I'd give 2 month's worth of rent but there would still be 9 more months on the lease for them. \n\nWIBTA if I moved out and broke my part of the lease knowing they won't be able to afford without me?\n\nEdit: a lot of you believe I do not want kids, I do want kids just wanted to be more stable hence the 2nd job. I just snapped at my brother for not knowing how to listen the first 2 months of it\n\nEdit 2: she has no way of being able to contact my brother.

Breakups are tough, but it does sound like you two weren\u2019t compatible at this stage in your life and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.", "Or he could be like 22.", "THIS. Put another word in there. Like sex (which more people can relate to than wanting kids). \u201cDo you want sex?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not ready for sex yet.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m almost done building the car.\u201d \u201cI want to pay off my loans.\u201d\n\nLiterally every response is going to feel like rejection unless you\u2019ve TALKED about it. And I mean saying \u201cyes, I want this. Here is my plan. What do you think? Are we on the same page with waiting for these things?\u201d\n\nOtherwise all you\u2019d be hearing is \u201cI don\u2019t want you.\u201d Then you hear them saying \u201cI never want to have sex!\u201d Like, yeah of course you\u2019re not going to believe them!\n\nFor the future OP, explicit communication is key. The steps you took were great but you need to communicate that BEFORE it blows up.", "I also did not want kids at 22. That\u2019s totally fine. Be up front about it.", "How does sex replace children in that sentence? The comparison doesn\u2019t even make sense. Sex is a short term thing while having kids is a long term commitment. You need to consider one their financial situation and two their living situation before having kids. While sex doesn\u2019t really even need those things, so definitely not the same thing.", "He is, and you're saying flat out he never wants kids with this partner. Which isn't necessarily true. He easily could want kids later, which is what he has told her. Right now, he'd rather pay off his loans and build a car.", "My point was how it comes across. I intentionally chose something personal that most people will be able to relate to (wanting to have sex) since a lot of people don\u2019t want kids and won\u2019t understand where his ex is coming from. It\u2019s personal to her. It\u2019s to illustrate that the rejection is a core issue. Prioritizing stability isn\u2019t the problem here. That\u2019s a good thing.\n\nBut if you repeatedly push something off without explicitly saying \u201cI want this and here is what I\u2019m doing to make it happen when the time is right\u201d until it\u2019s too late (like when she broke up with him) it\u2019s never going to work. The other party is going to feel like you don\u2019t actually want it. Which is what happened here.", "Go look at the edit.", "Sure, and yet she keeps asking. Doesn\u2019t seem like a recipe for a healthy long term relationship for these two particular people.", "Well, her breaking up with him over hearing part of one side of a conversation is also pretty toxic. Agreed that these two aren't ready", "NTA. People break up and break leases all the time. Sit down and have an adult conversation with them. 2 months is more than enough time to find a new roomie.\nAs someone who has rented rooms to couples: every single couple broke up mid lease. I make them make an agreement beforehand of exactly what will happen in case of a breakup. Who will move out, how many months will they pay, if the one staying will end  up paying more, etc. They always say they won\u2019t break up. People protect yourselves, whether you are part of the couple or the roommate.", "NTA.  I say this from my own experience, which I will outline briefly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was in a bad relationship and wanted out.  No other roommates but this BF.  I could afford the rent by myself.  He could not.  I couldn't seem to get rid of him.  Finally I moved back in with my parents, at whose home he knew he was unwelcome.  He ended up moving back in with his parents as well (I felt badly about that because they were nice enough, but oh well, I had to save myself).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes you've just gotta do what you've gotta do.", "NTA\n\nPeople need to stop peer pressuring others into having kids. Taking an extra year or two to save up instead of jumping in can mean the difference between barely making rent and feeding the family, and living a good life, both for yourself and your kids. \n\nKids are always a 2 yes/1 no situation. They are the biggest commitment you can get into. I refuse to shame OP for actually wanting to prepare before being ready.", "YTA for lying.", "Is it hard to find them a replacement roomate they would like. That would be the non AH thing. Legally you are good to break it but you were good enough friends to live with them you should respect them enough to help them find a replacement", "Well you said you decided to renew your lease,", "I\u2019m looking at th part of the post where OP communicated that they don\u2019t want children at all", ">he would've been all over the comments saying that he really does want them\n\nhe is", "First of all, do you know how much car builds can cost? It obviously depends on what he's building, but you could be looking at 20k+, easily. I have multiple friends who've dumped that much into a build. Children are also fucking expensive. It is a perfectly valid reason to not want kids (expensive) until you have an expensive goal out of the way.", "Not if his name is on the lease. If it is, the landlord can't change the conditions of the agreement without having the other three people sign a new contract. He can either take all of them to court for the part of OP's rent that isn't being paid, or do nothing. If he takes them to court, OP will be made responsible for the missing lease because he's on the original contract. The landlord can't just decide that the other three are now responsible to pay him more money because he says so.", "No it isn\u2019t. \n\nHaving goals you want to achieve before taking a major milestone is not putting off a conversation it\u2019s just being mature and knowing what you need before you hit that point.\n\nBeing financially stable and attaining some dreams is perfectly reasonable to want before committing to kids.", "If someone asks you if you want dinner and you say\n\u201cI don\u2019t want dinner yet\u201d \nDoes the mean you never want dinner or you just don\u2019t want dinner at that moment in time but it\u2019s something you\u2019d want when you are ready. \n\nHim saying \u201cYet\u201d indicates it\u2019s not a matter of desire but one predicated on time.", "Are you seriously comparing eating dinner to procreation?", "I did see that, thanks!", "Saying you\u2019re not ready for something yet implies that you want that thing but not at this current point in time. \n\nIf you\u2019re dating someone and they said they\u2019re not ready yet it doesn\u2019t mean they do not ever want sex it means at that point in time they want it.", "You\u2019re right. But it would still wear you down. Make you wonder if you\u2019re on the same page. Then you hear them yell \u201cI WILL NEVER HAVE SEX.\u201d Honestly, what would you think?\n\nIf you\u2019re the one always pushing for an answer (being the vulnerable party when you\u2019re emotionally invested in something it seems your partner is not) and they\u2019re always delaying it then you hear them saying they never want something, well, most people would be like OP\u2019s ex, realize they\u2019re not compatible and break things off. It doesn\u2019t matter if after the fact they come back to you like \u201cI do still want it but not right now\u201d because the already fragile trust has been broken."]}
