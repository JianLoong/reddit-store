Good God, the xenophobia in the responses is staggering, but not surprising. \n\nYour kids have gone through a big change with your fianc\u00e9 and her kid entering their home.

This doesn\u2019t necessarily necessarily mean they have negative feelings, but feelings nonetheless as they learn how to interact with two new people they did not have any choice in.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 and your kids are not entitled to know every thought that run through their head, just as, I\u2019m sure, she is speaking to her kid about how he is processing this change. \n\nYour kids should be allowed to have their own space, physical, and mental, and that means they might want to talk to each other about things they\u2019re feeling without having to constantly explain what they\u2019re saying to anyone else. They\u2019re allowed to process their own feelings at their own pace. \n\nNot to mention their home is somewhere they should feel safe speaking whatever language they\u2019re comfortable and, and given that you don\u2019t speak it either they\u2019re at real risk of losing it without practice. \n\nIt\u2019s really common for siblings to have something that\u2019s just for them, whether inside jokes or their private text chain, etc. \n\nAnd eventually this will include your new stepson, but it\u2019s not going to happen overnight. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 needs to recognize that there is an existing relationship between your kids and part of that relationship is built on their shared heritage and a shared language. They can absolutely share that with her son, but it\u2019s likely never going to be same because it\u2019s not his heritage, and that\u2019s ok. That\u2019s the beauty of a biracial family, you get to experience new things that you wouldn\u2019t experience in a single culture family. But she needs to respect that.\n\nI would reframe the issue here as building a stronger relationship between your kids (over time) and your fianc\u00e9\u2018s kid, then they will _want_ to include him, by speaking to him as they already do in English, but going out of their way to include him in inside jokes, private group chats, and new memories and transitions, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t have their own space, and it doesn\u2019t mean their existing traditions need to be erased or replaced.

People have been blending families for a while now and do not ask their children if they are allowed to remarry or include other children in their family. The ten year old boy did not make the decision to move in with these people either.\n\nThe children live wit their mother every other week, I don\u2019t think anyone is trying to erase their Pakistani culture. In that case, their mother should probably not have married and procreated with a non Pakistani if she thought their culture was at risk of being lost.", "Absolutely! I feel horrible I was dismissive of their needs in original post. Don\u2019t feel bad for suggesting that in deciding no parenting to check things out for all sides & confirming comfort level made dad an asshole. Stand by that conclusion, but admit my ignorance on language issue & unreservedly apologize for that.", "Of course you could say that. You could say that OPs residence and the co-parents residence are BOTH primary residences.", "Teaching a kid not to respect other cultures by setting the expectations that others have to conduct themselves by your standards is not a healthy lesson either.", "OP says the fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t mention any behavior like this and that she likely would not have left it out if it was present.", "Yes I agree. That's why I i think everyone saying \"well this isn't their primary residence so they should judt speak english\" is being ridiculous", "The parents should be focusing on integrating the household through shared interests and activities, not by policing the words of these _children_."]}
