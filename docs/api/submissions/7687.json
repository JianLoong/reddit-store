You're assuming, so is OP's stepkid. Speaking your mother tongue in your OWN home is not bullying.", "Yeah, no. You\u2019re assuming that.\n\nSpeaking to someone in a different language is not inherently exclusionary.\n\nBut expecting someone to change their primary language to convenience, or only expecting them to engage with you on your terms only is a great way to make sure they don\u2019t like you, and want to start excluding you.", "these comments are filled with insecure racists OP. you're NTA", "It's not their mother tongue though it's their mother's tongue ;P They're fluent in whatever language OP and his family speak at home and are choosing to erect a language barrier as a form of \"secret code\", a code as effective as any designed by human mind. [Speaking a different language was the **entire basis** of one of the most effective forms of code used in ***both World Wars***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_talker)", "You've had at least 15 years to learn, man.  Imagine if, in that time, you'd put in half the effort into trying as you had into making excuses.", "Then you don't sound qualified to decide what is hurtful and what isn't.  Language can still be weaponized even if the other person doesn't speak it.  Personally, I would feel completely excluded and be extremely distrustful if my (future) family spoke a language I couldn't understand around me all the time.  The kids should speak a common language around each other.  It's not required, it's not something they *have* to do, but sometimes we do things because they are polite and we don't want to exclude others.  These kids aren't random strangers, they will eventually be siblings.  Telling a child to suck it up and deal with it when they feel excluded and have no other options is just, really fucking sad, honestly.  YTA", "There could be a body language element, like furtive glances, suddenly seeming to change topic when someone enters the room. If was talking to someone else and glancing over in your direction would you assume you're the topic of discussion?", "Have you asked him?", "I read all your justifications. When someone you live with only speaks one language it\u2019s common courtesy to make an EFFORT to include them in your conversation. Or explain to them what youre saying to each other.", "Your workplace is not your home and your co\u2013workers aren't your friends so that the analogy fails. In this case, the brothers are sharing a living space. Hopefully they become close at some point. (Probably not because the Urdu speakers insist on acting in an exclusionary manner.)\n\nAnd if the kids need time and space to process, they can do it in their rooms. I do not agree that \"speaking another language\" is analogous to a private group chat. Again, it's akin to whispering. No, you wont change my mind. \n\nIt's also disingenuous to argue \"plenty of siblings have things that are just for them\" to justify the brother's speaking Urdu in front of the one person who doesn't. That's just rude. See my original post.", "In part because your kids are minors and you still need to parent them. In part because your future stepchild is a minor and will be living there.

I'm pretty sure he will say no, but it never hurts to ask, so I will ask.", "If you read it, you would've comprehended what I wrote better, but you are missing the last point that I made. I'm going to try one last time:\n\nThere's a difference between effort to include them in conversations generally, and restriction of a language in front of someone for ALL conversations. \n\nExample: \n\nEffort to include generally - my parents and I will speak in Spanish bc it's faster amongst ourselves, but will then switch over when speaking to that person specifically.\n\nRestriction of a language in front of someone for ALL conversations around them - my parents and I CANNOT speak spanish because we have an English speaker over because they \"are afraid\" we're going to speak about them. \n\nWhat you're speaking of is the first, but what the fiancee was suggesting was the second, and that's not ok.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 man that ego of yours \n\nYes, I started with your thread because you're not right, and disagreed with you, and I explained why.
