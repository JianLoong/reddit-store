Back out *now*, so somebody *else* can be on the hook for $1200. Or they agree to getting a cheaper place that you can afford, *too*.

NTA", "NTA but your friend is, both of them.", "NTA, however, I live in Manhattan and while I hope this question doesn\u2019t offend you, I have to ask: have you ever been to NYC before? Like, do you understand how expensive NYC is, even as a tourist? I don\u2019t know how much money you have saved but, unless it\u2019s a lot, I have to warn you that coming here on a $600/month income is a TERRIBLE idea if you want to do anything beyond walking around and eating at $10 food carts (both of which are fun/authentic NYC activities but not what tourists typically come here to do). Look, frankly, idk how long you\u2019re planning on staying in town but tourist season is ramping up and you\u2019re not going to find many cheap places to stay. I know people who once stayed in a converted van as their airbnb \u2014 cost $90/night and they had to use public toilets in a park. \n\nYour friend should be more understanding of your financial situation (or just travel with his girlfriend) but I think it may be a good idea for you to reconsider this trip in general.", "Exactly. If OP can't afford it, they can't afford it. What does the friend expect OP to do.....\n\nBut, I am curious how long the trip is and how much OP's budget is. NYC accomodations are very expensive so this may be a case of uncompatable travellers or OP may just not be aware of how expensive it is to visit the city."]}
