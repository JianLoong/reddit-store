For me, praying gives me great comfort and makes me feel at ease. I'm aware a lot of people using religion as a reason for all kinds of behaviour, but I genuinely believe in God, and firmly believe He loves everyone equally, regardless of their skincolor, sexual orientation or personal beliefs. He made us in His image after all, and gave us the freedom to experience life in our own ways. \n\nWith that in mind, a few weeks ago I met another girl who just transferred to my school. We hung out a few times and had fun, but she would always lash out at minor things and it was clear she was troubled by a lot of thoughts and frustrations. Because praying always comforts me when I feel upset, I asked her if she wanted to pray with me. I don't think I did so forcefully, and she could say no and we'd just hang out as usual.\n\nBut after I asked, she got really upset with me, told me I was forcing my beliefs on her, and that I was just getting close to her so I could convert her. I genuinely just wanted to try and make her feel better.

'cause the context and way of saying it might changed things. \n\n\" she would always lash out at minor things and it was clear she was troubled by a lot of thoughts and frustrations\"\n\nShe seems to be someone new in your life and throwing praying without you knowing her background might have been a problem.", "Gently, YTA. I don't think you realize how creepy it feels to a non religious person to be asked to pray. I don't even like it when I'm asked to bow my head in prayer at mealtimes by Christians. I do it but it's annoying how much Christians force you to do Christian stuff to keep the peace and take it personally if you don't. Christians seem particularly unable to understand that not everyone is a Christian and we shouldn't be forced to engage with it. Consequently even when you ask nicely but feels oppressive. It also gives off vibes that you'll judge a person for not being Christian because you're so embedded in the religion it doesn't occur to you that a person might not pray at all.", "As someone who is anti religion, not anti god, If you wanna believe it go ahead, it\u2019s something I don\u2019t wanna deal with at all, I personally believe that believing in god is something for yourself, something you do in your head and not spread the word or trying other ppl to join you.\n\nYour initial idea comes from a good place, you try to comfort her the way you like to comfort yourself, nothing wrong with that, but for the future just try to talk with someone to comfort them, just keep your believes to yourself unless the other person is clearly religious as well. \n\nSo, NTA but not the best move either.", "NTA\n\nBut it wasn't the best decision to invite a stranger to participate in a religious act. Prayer is comfort for you, to other's it can still today be a tool of control and punishment.", "Oh sweetheart, sending you a virtual hug right now. Difficulties in friendships are always hard and take an emotional toll. Are you okay?\n\nFirstly, I'm completely athiest. I was raised Catholic though so I have seen first hand the comfort prayer can bring and I can completely understand why that would be something you would reach for to comfort another. \n\nHowever, there's a lot of people out there who are religious and do try to impose their beliefs upon others and an equal amount who use their religion to have negative beliefs on many of those people you mentioned. Which can make it very hard for some people to know that not every religious person is that way, if that makes sense?\n\nI can also understand why offering prayer can make someone else uncomfortable. For me personally, it wouldn't fuss me, I know that most people do that with nothing but love in their hearts but I also know that I have been accosted in the street and told that my soul needs praying for, that they will pray for me and that witches burn in hell if they don't repent.. all because I have tattoos, piercings, lean on the gothy side of life and I had my 10yr old daughter with colourful hair, in a \"witchy\" style dress (just a black, long sleeved dress with moons and stars on. Perfectly appropriate for a 10yr old), a pan pride pin on and a bat handbag. \nUnfortunately this was a new friend and you don't know what their own experiences with religion are, or if someone has tried to force their beliefs upon them before. For some, inc my daughter, these situations can be really traumatic and I can only imagine if it was a worse situation how that may affect a person too. \n\nI think the best thing you can do is apologise for making them uncomfortable and explain that it was meant with no ill intent and you'd never try to force your beliefs on anyone else. You just tried to offer comfort in the best way you knew but you realise that's not what works for everyone & you'd really like a chance to continue your friendship, no prayer included. Ask them what brings them comfort so you know for next time. It might be a hug, it might be talking, it might be taking their mind off it. We're all different and all have different ways to bring ourselves comfort. For me, it's always without a shadow of a doubt, doing something that makes me laugh with the people I love. For my daughter, it's always pjs, fluffy socks and watching some silly tv shows. My husband on the other hand is a silence and a hug type of person, my grandmother though she's a light a candle and pray person. It's about knowing who needs what to bring them comfort without ever diminishing what it is that helps you. You just might have to do different things for different people.\n\nOverall though, you're not an arsehole darling.

There is no harm in asking if you know the person shares your beliefs, but organized religion has hurt and traumatized too many people to just assume.", "NAH\n\nReligion is a heavy subject. It may mean one thing to you, but also the direct opposite to someone else.", "YTA, unless she's expressed an interest don't try and push your religion on people.\n\nEven if you're not racist/homophobic/whatever, your religion and a bunch of people in it are, lots of people can find it insulting that'd you'd just presume they'd be into that, or that you're trying to get them into that.", "Absolutely NTA.

Because if you asked someone to pray with you who's people has a history of violent oppression by Christianity well... \n\nOr has she otherwise stated a faith that isn't Christian? The way she accused you of getting close to convert her leads me to believe there are details about her you omitted.", "NAH\n\nYou just asked, and there's no harm in this.

All you did was ask her and all she had to say was no. She overreacted.", "Soft yta for same reasons others have mentioned. For you and maybe most of the people you have grown up around an offer to pray maybe be seen as no biggie BUT as u have acknowledged in your post religion is at root of much bigotry and yes many who are  proselytize use soft approaches or offers to pray etc. \nIn general, when interacting with people it is best to keep religious practices to yourself unless that door has been specifically opened.\nThe comment saying pray with me is akin to asking to make out is kinda close. Praying is very personal.", "Gentle YTA. I would be so uncomfortable if someone asked me to pray out of nowhere. You have to remember just because YOU think \u201cgod loves everyone\u201d doesn\u2019t mean anything when the louder majority says the opposite.

Clearly there\u2019s something going on that you might not be aware of and it would be a more friendly approach to be there for her and get to know what\u2019s going on. I was like this when I was younger because my mom was dying + religious trauma. The answer to religious trauma is not more prayer.", "NAH. \nYou did something that works for YOU, maybe it could\u2019ve triggered something in her, but the best approach would have been to ask her if there\u2019s something you can do to help, and mention it helps you, but you are young, so you know, it\u2019s a  *teaching moment*", "Your actions, taken in a vacuum, are theoretically harmless and reasonable. But for someone looking at what you're doing with no knowledge of your inner thought process, there is no observable difference between you, who is making a genuine offer with no strings attached, and other religious people who make that kind of offer as a prelude to attempting to convert the person they're speaking with to their religion. You need to have some awareness of how other members of the groups you choose to be a part of act and operate, and how those will make your own actions look to others who don't already personally know you well.\n\nA gentle YTA for you here, because while it seems like you made the offer genuinely with no strings attached, you really should have been aware of how often the exact offer you made comes with ulterior motives.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they aren't already his followers, it's probably for a very good reason. Please stop asking people to pray with you in times of stress for them, instead offer support another way, like physical comfort or a listening ear. (ask what they would prefer or what would be supportive to them, also works pretty well)\n\nAlso praying for other people to a god that isn't theirs is considered hexing or cursing in many religious practices, in case anyone gets mad at you for \"praying for them\" in the future.", "Soft YTA \nI know you meant well but", "Gentle YTA. You just skipped a couple steps. Maybe first ask if she's religious or her views on religion. What you did was like asking someone you just met if they want to make out.

Im not accusing you of doing this, at least intentionally, but many christian leaders teach that there is no greater favor you could do for someone than to convert them, and perhaps this has somewhat colored your thinking. Even if not, your friend was probably reminded of all those experiences in the past when you asked to pray with them and reacted defensively.

There are people who actually hate religion for good reasons which I won't go into.   You tried to do something nice which is admirable but remember just because you believe in the bible does not mean everybody does.  Some people come from really shitty situations and God is the last thing they want to hear about.  Just make a mental note next time that you should keep the bible stuff to yourself unless somebody explicitly lets you know it's fine to talk about.

I have some next door neighbors that have made similar offers and brought up joining them at their church services, and as a decidedly NON-religious person, it creates an awkwardness between us, even though they don't seem offended when I say no.

Your friend was expressing frustration and you offered what you saw as a solution without asking what they wanted out of the interaction: advice, solutions, or just to vent. You just presented prayer (which, heavy) as a solution to their frustration. You don't even know if they're interested in prayer or religion, by this report. You just offered it, which, no. Don't do that. It's a good habit to ask what people want out of interactions and then try to provide that instead.", "NAH. \n\nReligion is a touchy subject and people can feel very, very uncomfortable when people suggest praying as a way to deal with their problems. I'm sure it makes you feel better but it's inappropriate when you're not sure how the recipient feels about religion. You wouldn't ask someone who has a drinking problem to unwind in a bar, you wouldn't tell an atheist to face their problems through prayer. \n\nYou're young, hearts in the right place. But this is a good lesson to learn that sometimes, people want human connection and human understanding. \n\nIt feels really dismissive to me personally if I open up to someone trying to establish a human connection, and am instead with religion.

To think you can say some magical words to cure whatever is troubling her is incredibly dismissive of what she might have gone through.", "ESH. As an atheist I am quite annoyed at invitations to chant to an imaginary being. So until someone clearly indicates their religious leanings, feel free to pray for them if it helps you, but keep it to yourself. Maybe listen to their troubles without judgement and do something tangible to help if you are able.\n\nYour friend could have simply said \u201cNo Thanks\u201d and it could have ended there, but my experience with Christians (and Vegans) is they seldom take no for an answer. Hold dear to your heart whatever gets you through the night, but leave others free to live their own lives.", "NAH, but perhaps there was misunderstanding/ making assumptions here.  It may be that OP made the suggestion before knowing her friend well enough.  Perhaps she could have included the other girl in her own prayers instead of inviting the new person to pray with her.  I mean, if one believes that prayer is effective, praying for another person is as effective as the person praying for themselves.\n\nFrom OP\u2019s description it doesn\u2019t sound like she was trying to push her beliefs\u2014but if there\u2019s one thing I know, it\u2019s that you can only control your own intentions when you speak; the other person is free to hear and interpret for themselves.  I subscribe to Christianity myself, but I have plenty of dear friends who believe Christianity has failed them.  If my life can be a positive example of Christian love (I\u2019m sure it\u2019s often not!) that\u2019s all the evangelization I want to do.  Honestly I doubt that it\u2019s effective to invite someone to pray unless one is in a gathering where they\u2019ve been asked to offer a prayer.\n\nI do feel like the friend overreacted, if OP is being completely accurate.

I find the idea of being prayed for to be alarming due to religious trauma and find it to be an empty way to feel like you helped instead of actually helping.", "But that's rule is too vague for reddit. Necklace pendants literally wag. We can't just consider everyone an AH because of our own religious trauma. Not everyone is as forward as OP . But it seems like OP is learning her flaw in that.", "A big part of LGBT is NOT sharing information with the wrong people. There is a huge stigma about outting people.", "It does not matter what of what a limited group of people may use later translations for, Rotting Pony should have asked for more information instead of being prejudice, they are absolutely talking out of their ass, and there is no \u201cprobably an American Christian\u201d. They assumed, that means they are talking out of their ass. Reddit is diverse enough to make that assumption baseless.", "How? \nIt would be the same as OP asking the friend if she wanted a hug, and it turns out the friend HATES physical touch. OP had no way of knowing that before she asked, she never pushed for anything, she simply just ASKED.", "Can u read because how did she push her religion?", "It\u2019s just like asking someone it they want a hug? If they don\u2019t like physical touch they say no. If you don\u2019t want to pray you say no", "I agree. I am an atheist and not fond of religion but if a person kindly offers me to pray with them thinking that it may help me I just politely say no but thank you for wanting to help. Asking is no crime, but reacting like an AH makes OP's friend an AH. \n\nNTA", "Maybe, but doesn\u2019t mean she needs to freak out. So are you all assuming her past now?", "Nope."]}
