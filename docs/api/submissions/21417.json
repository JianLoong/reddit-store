For me, praying gives me great comfort and makes me feel at ease. I'm aware a lot of people using religion as a reason for all kinds of behaviour, but I genuinely believe in God, and firmly believe He loves everyone equally, regardless of their skincolor, sexual orientation or personal beliefs. He made us in His image after all, and gave us the freedom to experience life in our own ways. \n\nWith that in mind, a few weeks ago I met another girl who just transferred to my school. We hung out a few times and had fun, but she would always lash out at minor things and it was clear she was troubled by a lot of thoughts and frustrations. Because praying always comforts me when I feel upset, I asked her if she wanted to pray with me. I don't think I did so forcefully, and she could say no and we'd just hang out as usual.\n\nBut after I asked, she got really upset with me, told me I was forcing my beliefs on her, and that I was just getting close to her so I could convert her. I genuinely just wanted to try and make her feel better.

'cause the context and way of saying it might changed things. \n\n\" she would always lash out at minor things and it was clear she was troubled by a lot of thoughts and frustrations\"\n\nShe seems to be someone new in your life and throwing praying without you knowing her background might have been a problem.", "Gently, YTA. I don't think you realize how creepy it feels to a non religious person to be asked to pray. I don't even like it when I'm asked to bow my head in prayer at mealtimes by Christians. I do it but it's annoying how much Christians force you to do Christian stuff to keep the peace and take it personally if you don't. Christians seem particularly unable to understand that not everyone is a Christian and we shouldn't be forced to engage with it. Consequently even when you ask nicely but feels oppressive. It also gives off vibes that you'll judge a person for not being Christian because you're so embedded in the religion it doesn't occur to you that a person might not pray at all.", "As someone who is anti religion, not anti god, If you wanna believe it go ahead, it\u2019s something I don\u2019t wanna deal with at all, I personally believe that believing in god is something for yourself, something you do in your head and not spread the word or trying other ppl to join you.\n\nYour initial idea comes from a good place, you try to comfort her the way you like to comfort yourself, nothing wrong with that, but for the future just try to talk with someone to comfort them, just keep your believes to yourself unless the other person is clearly religious as well. \n\nSo, NTA but not the best move either.", "NTA\n\nBut it wasn't the best decision to invite a stranger to participate in a religious act. Prayer is comfort for you, to other's it can still today be a tool of control and punishment.", "Oh sweetheart, sending you a virtual hug right now. Difficulties in friendships are always hard and take an emotional toll. Are you okay?\n\nFirstly, I'm completely athiest. I was raised Catholic though so I have seen first hand the comfort prayer can bring and I can completely understand why that would be something you would reach for to comfort another. \n\nHowever, there's a lot of people out there who are religious and do try to impose their beliefs upon others and an equal amount who use their religion to have negative beliefs on many of those people you mentioned. Which can make it very hard for some people to know that not every religious person is that way, if that makes sense?\n\nI can also understand why offering prayer can make someone else uncomfortable. For me personally, it wouldn't fuss me, I know that most people do that with nothing but love in their hearts but I also know that I have been accosted in the street and told that my soul needs praying for, that they will pray for me and that witches burn in hell if they don't repent.. all because I have tattoos, piercings, lean on the gothy side of life and I had my 10yr old daughter with colourful hair, in a \"witchy\" style dress (just a black, long sleeved dress with moons and stars on. Perfectly appropriate for a 10yr old), a pan pride pin on and a bat handbag. \nUnfortunately this was a new friend and you don't know what their own experiences with religion are, or if someone has tried to force their beliefs upon them before. For some, inc my daughter, these situations can be really traumatic and I can only imagine if it was a worse situation how that may affect a person too. \n\nI think the best thing you can do is apologise for making them uncomfortable and explain that it was meant with no ill intent and you'd never try to force your beliefs on anyone else. You just tried to offer comfort in the best way you knew but you realise that's not what works for everyone & you'd really like a chance to continue your friendship, no prayer included. Ask them what brings them comfort so you know for next time. It might be a hug, it might be talking, it might be taking their mind off it. We're all different and all have different ways to bring ourselves comfort. For me, it's always without a shadow of a doubt, doing something that makes me laugh with the people I love. For my daughter, it's always pjs, fluffy socks and watching some silly tv shows. My husband on the other hand is a silence and a hug type of person, my grandmother though she's a light a candle and pray person. It's about knowing who needs what to bring them comfort without ever diminishing what it is that helps you. You just might have to do different things for different people.\n\nOverall though, you're not an arsehole darling.

There is no harm in asking if you know the person shares your beliefs, but organized religion has hurt and traumatized too many people to just assume.", "NAH\n\nReligion is a heavy subject. It may mean one thing to you, but also the direct opposite to someone else.", "YTA, unless she's expressed an interest don't try and push your religion on people.\n\nEven if you're not racist/homophobic/whatever, your religion and a bunch of people in it are, lots of people can find it insulting that'd you'd just presume they'd be into that, or that you're trying to get them into that.", "Absolutely NTA.

Because if you asked someone to pray with you who's people has a history of violent oppression by Christianity well... \n\nOr has she otherwise stated a faith that isn't Christian? The way she accused you of getting close to convert her leads me to believe there are details about her you omitted.", "NAH\n\nYou just asked, and there's no harm in this.

All you did was ask her and all she had to say was no. She overreacted.", "Soft yta for same reasons others have mentioned. For you and maybe most of the people you have grown up around an offer to pray maybe be seen as no biggie BUT as u have acknowledged in your post religion is at root of much bigotry and yes many who are  proselytize use soft approaches or offers to pray etc. \nIn general, when interacting with people it is best to keep religious practices to yourself unless that door has been specifically opened.\nThe comment saying pray with me is akin to asking to make out is kinda close. Praying is very personal.", "Gentle YTA. I would be so uncomfortable if someone asked me to pray out of nowhere. You have to remember just because YOU think \u201cgod loves everyone\u201d doesn\u2019t mean anything when the louder majority says the opposite.

Clearly there\u2019s something going on that you might not be aware of and it would be a more friendly approach to be there for her and get to know what\u2019s going on. I was like this when I was younger because my mom was dying + religious trauma. The answer to religious trauma is not more prayer.", "NAH. \nYou did something that works for YOU, maybe it could\u2019ve triggered something in her, but the best approach would have been to ask her if there\u2019s something you can do to help, and mention it helps you, but you are young, so you know, it\u2019s a  *teaching moment*", "Your actions, taken in a vacuum, are theoretically harmless and reasonable. But for someone looking at what you're doing with no knowledge of your inner thought process, there is no observable difference between you, who is making a genuine offer with no strings attached, and other religious people who make that kind of offer as a prelude to attempting to convert the person they're speaking with to their religion. You need to have some awareness of how other members of the groups you choose to be a part of act and operate, and how those will make your own actions look to others who don't already personally know you well.\n\nA gentle YTA for you here, because while it seems like you made the offer genuinely with no strings attached, you really should have been aware of how often the exact offer you made comes with ulterior motives.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It also means you assumed she didn't have a diety of her own, your own God punishes for praying to \"false\" gods, after all.\n\nEveryone in the world knows about the abrahamic god at this point. If they aren't already his followers, it's probably for a very good reason. Please stop asking people to pray with you in times of stress for them, instead offer support another way, like physical comfort or a listening ear. (ask what they would prefer or what would be supportive to them, also works pretty well)\n\nAlso praying for other people to a god that isn't theirs is considered hexing or cursing in many religious practices, in case anyone gets mad at you for \"praying for them\" in the future.", "Soft YTA \nI know you meant well but", "Gentle YTA. You just skipped a couple steps. Maybe first ask if she's religious or her views on religion. What you did was like asking someone you just met if they want to make out.

Im not accusing you of doing this, at least intentionally, but many christian leaders teach that there is no greater favor you could do for someone than to convert them, and perhaps this has somewhat colored your thinking. Even if not, your friend was probably reminded of all those experiences in the past when you asked to pray with them and reacted defensively.

There are people who actually hate religion for good reasons which I won't go into.   You tried to do something nice which is admirable but remember just because you believe in the bible does not mean everybody does.  Some people come from really shitty situations and God is the last thing they want to hear about.  Just make a mental note next time that you should keep the bible stuff to yourself unless somebody explicitly lets you know it's fine to talk about.

I have some next door neighbors that have made similar offers and brought up joining them at their church services, and as a decidedly NON-religious person, it creates an awkwardness between us, even though they don't seem offended when I say no.

Your friend was expressing frustration and you offered what you saw as a solution without asking what they wanted out of the interaction: advice, solutions, or just to vent. You just presented prayer (which, heavy) as a solution to their frustration. You don't even know if they're interested in prayer or religion, by this report. You just offered it, which, no. Don't do that. It's a good habit to ask what people want out of interactions and then try to provide that instead.", "NAH. \n\nReligion is a touchy subject and people can feel very, very uncomfortable when people suggest praying as a way to deal with their problems. I'm sure it makes you feel better but it's inappropriate when you're not sure how the recipient feels about religion. You wouldn't ask someone who has a drinking problem to unwind in a bar, you wouldn't tell an atheist to face their problems through prayer. \n\nYou're young, hearts in the right place. But this is a good lesson to learn that sometimes, people want human connection and human understanding. \n\nIt feels really dismissive to me personally if I open up to someone trying to establish a human connection, and am instead with religion.

To think you can say some magical words to cure whatever is troubling her is incredibly dismissive of what she might have gone through.", "ESH. As an atheist I am quite annoyed at invitations to chant to an imaginary being. So until someone clearly indicates their religious leanings, feel free to pray for them if it helps you, but keep it to yourself. Maybe listen to their troubles without judgement and do something tangible to help if you are able.\n\nYour friend could have simply said \u201cNo Thanks\u201d and it could have ended there, but my experience with Christians (and Vegans) is they seldom take no for an answer. Hold dear to your heart whatever gets you through the night, but leave others free to live their own lives.", "NAH, but perhaps there was misunderstanding/ making assumptions here.  It may be that OP made the suggestion before knowing her friend well enough.  Perhaps she could have included the other girl in her own prayers instead of inviting the new person to pray with her.  I mean, if one believes that prayer is effective, praying for another person is as effective as the person praying for themselves.\n\nFrom OP\u2019s description it doesn\u2019t sound like she was trying to push her beliefs\u2014but if there\u2019s one thing I know, it\u2019s that you can only control your own intentions when you speak; the other person is free to hear and interpret for themselves.  I subscribe to Christianity myself, but I have plenty of dear friends who believe Christianity has failed them.  If my life can be a positive example of Christian love (I\u2019m sure it\u2019s often not!) that\u2019s all the evangelization I want to do.  Honestly I doubt that it\u2019s effective to invite someone to pray unless one is in a gathering where they\u2019ve been asked to offer a prayer.\n\nI do feel like the friend overreacted, if OP is being completely accurate.

For example if you are Christian how would you feel if someone says \u201cmay Satan look favorably upon you\u201d or \u201cwould you like to pray to satan with me\u201d (and note here I am using Satan to mean the modern Christian concept of Satan being the devil).

Many morals and ethics have changed since those days, and the Bible does not reflect those changes, which makes it unsuitable for the current age. On top of that, it is written by men, which in itself leads itself to errors. But again, that is just my belief. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for my friend, I am going to write her a letter to apologise.

At my lowest point in life, someone befriended me only to drop me the second I politely responded to their invitation to their church by saying I already went to a different church. I didn't need proselytizing, I needed a friend, and she didn't truly care at all outside of some hypothetical God points or something.\n\nHonestly, there's more opportunity to make someone very uncomfortable with that question than there is to comfort them.

Not me.* (And I usually don't say yes. When I agree to \"pray\" with someone it's becuase I know it's in a moment they need comfort/to feel like they're doing something.) Praying might be magic for you, but it isn't for a lot of people, and I'd just go ahead and assume it isn't for anyone who hasn't explicitly expressed being religious. \n\nAnd for you to assume that you praying with/for your friend would make her feel better is extremely presumptious, and clearly by her response, wrong.", "NTA.

I was your friend on many occasions where someone thought they knew better than I did and needed to pray.  It disgusted me every time.  100% of the population needs to vent on occasion when they are upset.  If believing in a god gives you comfort while human beings do terrible things to each other, pray.  You asking someone who you have no idea of their religious beliefs or lack thereof to pray IS pushing your religion on them.  Just stop.", "NTA, as long as it was a genuine offer and you wouldn't get upset by her no. \nThat being be said, I would suggest emphasize that it's a friendly offer and an expectation, and you  wouldn't get offended if someone says no.

When I feel like that I pray and it really seems to help.\"  Leave it wide open like that.", "I'm not surprised this was a concern for her as getting close to people to convert them is a recommended tactic of missionaries or people who want to convert others to their religious creed.

Good chance she doesn\u2019t know you are an accepting religious person.\n\nI think there are other ways of going about what you were trying to accomplish. If she\u2019s struggling with something then you personally can pray for her well being in your own time.

Then ASK if there is ANYTHING (within reason) that you can do to help them or make them feel better.  \n\n\nThis is an open ended question. Don't suggest any solution in particular. Just show them that you care, and that you want to help, even if that just means listening quietly while someone vents their frustrations. I find that most times, when people are upset, they are in the midst of processing their emotions, and need to externalize those feelings in order to understand themselves better. Having someone there to simply listen and hear your thoughts, concerns, and feelings, is very cathartic, and usually after an hour or so of venting, they become exhausted and just want to rest.  \n\n\nNot every problem has a clear solution. Life is messy. Allow people to work through their feelings. If they want you to do something specific for them, they can ask for that, and it's easier for them to do that if you give an open-ended offer such as \"I'm here for you, I'm listening, and if there is anything I can do to help, let me know and I will try my best.\"  \n\n\nI'm not religious, and I think religion does a whole lot more harm than good in the world.

Not to mention all the horrors carried out by literally every organized religion throughout history.   \n\n\nAll of this to say, religion may have helped you in your life, but religion has absolutely destroyed many people's lives, and it's important to be sensitive to that fact.   \n\n\nYou don't need religion to be a good person. You just have to see yourself in others, and others in yourself. Empathy, Compassion, selflessness. These are the things religion got right... but those things are kind of obvious anyway and I'd argue that we don't need religion in order to care about each other. In fact... If the only reason you are kind to other people is because you think sky daddy would be mad if you were mean.... You're probably not a great person after all.  \n\n\nYTA, but only a little bit. You made helping her about you and your beliefs, rather than looking at the situation objectively and asking the person what THEY needed.", "Gentle YTA. People don't always feel the same way about religion, so its generally best to keep it to yourself. Also it can easily be condescending to offer prayer. Sure you didn't mean bad but that's the lesson here. It's not always intentions that matter.", "Honestly, anyone saying OP is an asshole needs to take some time to figure out for themselves how to communicate like a functioning human being.  Whatever your beliefs (or lack thereof), there is zero need for such an aggressive response in the first instance.\n\nI think it\u2019s kind of odd to have any kind of belief pertaining to an afterlife/deity etc. and I\u2019m pretty firmly against organised religion and the influence it has.  But if someone innocently and peacefully asks if I\u2019d like to pray with them, I will be a grown-ass adult about it and simply say \u201csorry man, not really my thing.\u201d  I\u2019ll even gladly parlay that into a philosophical discussion about beliefs if they\u2019re open to that, as it\u2019s an interesting discussion to have when all sides remain respectful, and a good way to see where each is coming from.\n\nIf OP had been pushy beyond that initial offer of prayer, or if beliefs had been discussed prior to that offer (in which case OP would have already been aware of the other party\u2019s lack of belief) then that\u2019s asshole behaviour.

I have had several people tell me they will pray for me in times of stress or hardship, and while I do not follow their religion, I appreciate that to them, that is one of the best, most comforting things they can offer me.

First, learn to accept the fact that some people just don't want help and want to either vent or act out in certain ways to cope with their own mental needs. This is a really hard thing to remember because, as humans, we feel compelled to help those we care about (this is not a flaw you have by any means). Second, if you do still feel compelled to help, or even if you're asked, offer advice in the form of \"i know praying isn't for everyone, but it helps me sometimes. I'd be happy to try it with you if you ever want to.\" But don't ever just flat out ask because you truly never know what reaction you'll get. \n\nI'm sure you're a good person and I'm sure you meant well.

Praying would do nothing for her, because there is no meaning behind it. She might as well say \"Ooga Booga Baloney Sandwich\" and it will have the same kind of gravitas behind it as prayer would for her. So praying will simply not work for Gina (or any nonreligious person) in any situation. For people who don't believe in a deity, praying usually feels extremely silly and embarrassing (because they believe it does nothing) and actually would make Gina's mood even worse. \n\nPlenty of people who struggle with mental illness (or anything really) have experienced the person who tells them that religion is the answer.

I know people have negative experiences with religion. It sucks, but you can't take it out on any religious person who decides to share their faith with you. If they don't take 'no' for an answer, they're an AH, but they're not an AH for asking.

She might also have been under pressure in relation to religion or been subjected to unpleasant experiences because of religious people in the past.  Apologize and explain that you weren't trying to push your religion on her, that you only offered because she was upset and praying helps you feel calm, but you now understand that might not be helpful for everyone or even what they chose to do or believe in.

It was from a place of good intentions \n\nBut OP, please realize - there are many many people who have a very difficult relationship with religion particularly Christianity \n\nIt can carry such bad memories and trauma that even a mild invitation to prayer or church can seem like an attack - and in fact those invitations may have been used as an attack at one time \n\nYour invitation was NOT an attack - but it seems like your friend has a history with institutional religion that brings back bad memories to her \n\nDon\u2019t feel bad about this - just tread lightly in the future and maybe avoid religious topics \n\nYou may also want to decide for yourself whether you still want to be friends with her. Religion and prayer is extremely important to you - can you be friends with someone for whom those topics are painful and to be avoided? \n\nYou deserve to be friends with people you feel your whole self with", "YTA people dont want to be converted or prayed for or whatever. Pushing religion on other people is the best wY to turn that person against religion. Instead of offering comfort you offer judgment.", "Yta. As an adult I'm gonna give you some advice: never ever share your religious and political views with people you don't know well. Not everyone believes what you believe and what brings you comfort can make others uncomfortable.", "I don't think the religious piece of this matters much.\n\nThis person is troubled, so much so that they exhibit it to a new acquaintance. A normal response is to back away from the beginning friendship. Your instinct, though, is to try to fix things. It's worth really questioning your own motives, and reading about codependency. Sometimes we try to solve other people's problems as a way to feel good about ourselves, and avoid our own problems.", "yeah don't do that, really bad actually", "YTA, just because you believe, it doesn't mean everyone else does. You should have asked her first if she had faith before going straight to asking her to pray.", "YTA, dont push your religion into ppl. You want to confort her? Be a friend, not force her to pray as if that will solve all of her life's problems", ">This is the devils lair.\n\nAnd yet, here you are.  \n\nWelcome to the dark side.", "You can have all the good intentions in the world with an offer to pray with someone, but for a lot of people religion can be a trigger. I was raised in a Christian home and if someone asked if I wanted to pray with them it would be taking a hard turn onto the express lane out of my life.", "Christians hurt themselves more than anything with their conversion tactics. I was raised in it, taught all the tricks, and when I stopped going to church I got all of those tactics turned on me. It\u2019s so annoying that you can\u2019t be friends with a person without them constantly trying to recruit you to their religion. Can\u2019t even go to family gatherings without everyone disrespecting my choices and right to say no. Everyone is so condescending and patronizing about your life choices when you aren\u2019t apart of the church anymore. All of that made me absolutely sure that leaving my religion was the best choice.", "She 100% told us what her religion is. She was evangelizing. Jews don\u2019t evangelize, that\u2019s how I can tell.", ">peer/social pressure inherent in requests\n\nMaybe they're not ignoring it. Maybe they're instead making the reasonable assumption that, in friendships, you can both be comfortable telling each other \"no\" and thus not feel pressured.", ">OP is a 16 year old\n\nAt 16, feeling like you've let a friend down can be very crushing.", "The other girl didn't ask for help. OP states she offered the prayer to help her because she could see she was struggling and lashing out. She wasn't asked for help and ignored that and offered prayer instead. \n\nIt was a misguided move with nothing but pure intentions. A lesson she will learn and grow from for sure but she wasn't in any way ignoring the girl asking for help so it's a little more nuanced than that. \nShe wasn't attempting to force her religion upon her (though any offer of prayer can always be interpreted that way)\nShe wasn't ignoring the other girl reaching out \nShe wasn't attempting to diminish how she felt or be purposefully hurtful. \n\nShe was doing what she would want someone to do for her at a time of her own crisis. She was attempting to be compassionate and caring. & at 16, whilst old enough to know better in some circumstances, it's not old enough to know everything. Especially if she herself is religious", "Jesus went to hell too to preach the good news and take the keys from satan to hell and the grave. I go where he goes.", "Anything can be offensive if you find someone sensitive enough. I\u2019m not even religious and y\u2019all are way overreacting. She had good intentions and wasn\u2019t being an ass about it", "Missing the point completely \ud83d\ude44\n\nNot \"what words should she use to decline\" but \"what does the act of praying achieve for OP's friend\". It won't make her feel better. If she does it, it will be to make OP feel better.", "Same. I guess a lot of current day Christians don\u2019t know that even forgetting the holocaust, in our history at times, the options were to convert, or be tortured and burned alive. AND, over the years, I\u2019ve discovered I know much more about the Bible than they do, anyway.", "Are you any religion other than Christian? If you\u2019re Christian do you think religious minorities don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about? Talking about religion as OP did is very uncomfortable for religious minorities.", "Go ahead,tell that to observant American Indians. Or do you not consider theirs a real religion.", "The problem with discussing politics is no one is going to change the other\u2019s opinion, no matter how many facts are brought up. It just leads to arguments about who is right or wrong. People are either conservative or liberal and a few are apathetic, but you aren\u2019t going to change their core beliefs.", "No but by doing that you can figure out who's racist and homophobic, who believes in stripping away basic human rights, and learn to avoid those people or cut them out of your life If you want. \n\nI certainly would want to know if somebody close to me is homophobic, I'm bisexual that won't fly with me. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23"]}
