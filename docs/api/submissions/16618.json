First, your eldest is 13. Unless you're gone from the house for days at a time, you don't need a sitter. In that instance, actually, you'd need a guardian. So again, a sitter doesn't solve this problem. Second, your brother is doing you a favour, especially because your oldest is 13, so the least you could do is compensate him for his time.", "YTA. Why are you expecting someone else to literally raise your kids for you? Do you think they're some kind of accessory you get to show off without any effort on your part?

You should find someone who actually wants that job, and not try to force it on to someone.\n\nI'm not going to make a judgement call on if having someone run your home for you is an asshole move or not. But trying to FORCE the work on someone else IS DEFINITELY an asshole move.", "**YTA**\n\nSo first of all, it's not unreasonable of you to expect your brother to pay rent. I don't think you should feel like TA on this point. However, you bring up $1,750 as if that's what you'd get from a reasonable person now for his living situation - as many are saying, that's not reasonable at all. I wouldn't even pay you $700 for that. And if he's WFH, that's NOT THE SAME as \"being at home all day\".\n\nYour brother wasn't living at your place \"rent-free\" once you started issuing ultimatums for him to do domestic work. You're holding a vague, unpaid obligation over his head, and exploiting the fact that he's in a difficult situation. \n\nIt's disgusting that you'd use this as leverage this to any person; doubly so that this is your own brother!\n\nWhat you need to do is calm down and talk to your brother about both of your expectations going forward. And you can't start from the vantage point of thinking that you're a saint giving him a $1,750 place to stay - you're not on both counts.\n\nIf you want to be compensated by your brother, come to an agreement about an actual dollar figure; and if you want him to babysit likewise come to an agreement about paying him instead of expecting him to be grateful enough to become your servant because he couldn't afford a roof over his head. You can't just give vague instructions about \"babysitting\" - it sounds like you want him to do anything and everything you don't want to do for your kids.", "I don't know why you people fucking do this. The only thing is he lives there rent free. That is the factor here. He needs to pay somehow.  It seems money would just make more sense here. \n\nYou can't play these games with your siblings in regards to childcare. \"He has the opportunity to raise his nephews\" that is such an unnecessary comment cause you assume its a fucking opportunity to look after someone else's kids. Looking after kids is hard as hell and you made the choice to have them..and then to get a break for yourself you try to manipulate others into saying shit like that. \n\nHe should be paying money. And then it's all even.  His time is his own and your childcare is your issue.\n\nThis living arrangement isn't good", "It actually doesn\u2019t matter what everyone votes here - the best karma will be when you\u2019re left high and dry and actually have to watch your own kids when your brother moves out. You\u2019ll be the next choosy beggar asking why no one wants to work\u2026 we give free housing, why do you want money on top of that? You have the pleasure of raising our angels. Why would you need to buy anything else?", "YTA - Yeah, your attitude is vile.  You don't want a sitter, you want a nanny and a housekeeper and an underpaid one at that. \n\nHow much space was your brother paying $1750 a month for?  I am guessing it isn't a room in a house shared with a family with 3 kids.  So no, your space isn't worth $1750 a month.  Calculate how much your space is ACTUALLY worth, then look at how many hours nanny time you would get for that worth.  I am willing to bet you already have the sweet end of this deal. \n\nAnd by the way, what do you and your wife do parenting wise?  Because *pick up, drop off, homework, bathes, errands, walking the dogs, bedtime, etc* sounds like a large portion of it already.", "People like OP always make me wonder why they had kids in the first place.  You\u2019re not asking him to babysit, you\u2019re asking him to be mother and father to YOUR children.  As a teacher I find these are the parents that act like your giving them a chore when you ask to speak to them about their kid.  I had a mother who stayed on the phone (standing just outside the school) through me telling them their son had a BAD day and only started to care when their kid (who is still rageful and mom hasn\u2019t even noticed his demeanor) ripped the door handle off their locked Escalade.  And by care I mean acknowledge their child in any way.

Some nannies do this, yes, but that\u2019s usually something a family would pay extra for as that chore definitely crosses over into housekeeping, not regular childcare. IMO and experience anyway.) \n\nYou are not obligated to house anyone other than your own minor children rent-free, this is true. You would be within your rights to charge him rent. However, you are not entitled to suddenly establish new and unreasonable expectations for him without his consent, and certainly not without offering to compensate him fairly for his contributions. You are severely overestimating the value of what you\u2019re doing for him by letting him stay.", "YTA You\u2019re one of those people on r/ChoosingBeggars looking for a Nanny for $1.50 an hour and wondering why you can\u2019t find anyone.\n\nCharge your brother rent but don\u2019t expect him to be a full time nanny especially when he already has a full time job.", "YTA for many reasons, including thinking nannies are also housekeepers and msids.

Also, being at home all day doesn't mean his just sitting and watching TV. He's also working. You said that he offered to help. That makes me think that he didn't need to live in your house, so basically he was making you a favor and you were returning it by letting him live in your house without rent.
