My grandfather was a chef, my mother is a chef, and my \u201cretail era\u201d of employment was spent in commercial kitchens so I am extremely wary of the food safety knowledge of strangers. I would say I cook about 95-98% of my own meals and I only get takeout from maybe 5 restaurants.\n\n2: I don\u2019t really believe in making friends at work. I have no problem being cordial and outgoing at work, I just don\u2019t want my personal and professional lives to ever be intertwined. My department does lots of social events like bar crawls and volunteer days and I just don\u2019t participate.\n\nAbout once a month, there\u2019s a department-wide potluck lunch and while it\u2019s not mandatory to participate, it\u2019s generally expected. I started working here in April and pretty quickly realized the company culture wasn\u2019t my favourite but I like the work and the benefits. I am passively looking for another job but it\u2019s not a huge priority right now because I just moved.\n\nToday was the monthly potluck and I didn\u2019t participate, as usual. I brought my own lunch (as usual) and went to eat in the department huddle room, where everyone eats lunch. A manager comes in about 15 minutes later and sees me eating. She stops and comments \u201cWow! That looks great!\u201d I thanked her and briefly explained what it was before she went to the potluck table. I guess she realized that what I had wasn\u2019t on the table so she returned and asked if she had missed it. I explained that I actually only brought lunch for myself that day but it looked like there was plenty of other food available to try.\n\nShe got a little huffy with me and said, \u201cI thought everyone learned to bring enough for the class in elementary school.\u201d I replied that I don\u2019t really feel comfortable participating in potlucks but in the spirit of fairness, I don\u2019t take anyone else\u2019s food either. She continued by saying that I should have just eaten in my cubicle if I was going to be antisocial and \u201cshit on\u201d the company culture. She also said that I have a shitty attitude and don\u2019t belong in the department if I can\u2019t play nice with everyone.\n\nBy this point, people are staring, so I told her that I don\u2019t feel comfortable eating food that comes from a stranger\u2019s kitchen but that\u2019s my prerogative. She continues to argue with me, insisting that I could have at least brought enough to share if I was going to be a \u201cweirdo\u201d that \u201cnever participates in anything \u2018we\u2019 do.\u201d\n\nBeing called names was my final straw and I told her that not everyone lacks such a fulfilling personal life that they can only find friends in a place where everyone is obligated to talk to them.

When I need to express my dissatisfaction with anyone lower than me in authority in a professional context, the only professional thing to do is to do it 1-to1 in a private space. Your manager should not have confronted you where everyone is present whatever the company culture of participating is.", "NTA\n\n\u201cI thought everyone learned to bring enough for the class in elementary school.\u201d\n\nWell, you aren't in elementary school and you aren't toddlers. Adults should know they don't always get what they want.\n\nThis kind of mindset is absolutely insane and infuriating to me. My foreman used to buy us pizza when we had to work mandatory overtime, but then departments where bosses didn't do that started to complain so the company told us we couldn't do that anymore. So then I started bringing in pizza for my co-workers. \n\nHonestly I would have went to HR about this claiming a toxic work environment and bullying.", "NTA - I personally like potlucks but I have family, let\u2019s call her E,  who due to severe health allergies cannot risk eating anything that they don\u2019t make in their own kitchen. And yes, that means E doesn\u2019t eat out. If E attends a family event, they have to bring and eat only their food. \n\nIt\u2019s already a source of embarrassment for E, because they have to turn down so many things that most of us take for granted, and E always feels they have to defend their choices to people or try to make others understand so there are no hurt feelings. I can\u2019t imagine a manager saying something like this to E. It would devastate them. \n\nIt\u2019s a potluck, not a business meeting. And you were still trying to socialize by sitting with the group, just eating your own food. SMDH", "NTA. You aren\u2019t required to participate in something you are uncomfortable with. It\u2019s a fact of life. She was trying to shame you publicly for your choice. Nope. I wouldn\u2019t have had any of that and I think you were quite tactful in response.", "What kind of annoying human being starts scolding someone like a child for BRINGING their own lunch. This is one hundred percent not okay, and the fact that you had to argue with a manager over this, I would report her. She was being very rude and unprofessional. \n\nNTA", "NTA and you may consider recording this interaction/eyewitness testimonies to submit to HR. This was really weird on the manager's part", "NTAH\n\nWork potlucks are the worst, especially these days. Some employees always end up paying more or working harder than the one employee who brings garlic bread.", "NTA. Though with a caveat. I think one person abandoning the bounds of professionalism doesn't necessarily give others leave to do the same. There are usually methods for handling verbally abusive behavior (which she was) or simple lack of professionalism in a corporate setting. Tit-for-tat mentality tends to devolve very quickly. So, I do think your final rejoinder to her was unprofessional, and therefore a bit over the line, she pushed this situation at that point beyond anything reasonable, so I'd still stand by NTA.  \n\n\n(Perhaps another option would have been to walk away sooner and file a complaint. You shouldn't **have** to do such a thing, but it's probably the high road, which is what I'd want from my employees, managers, and coworkers in terms of professional mien.)", "NTA this is unbelievably unprofessional coming from a manager. I don't know if it's a hill you want to die on, but if you do end up finding another job, make sure you include this in your exit interview and/or file an incident report with HR. Nobody who can be made so hangry by being denied a scoop of your chicken alfredo that they degenerate into abuse should be in charge of other people's work lives.", "NTA, though you may want to consider trying to placate her a bit. She was incredibly rude and insulting and ignorant about the irony of telling you to \"play nice\" with others. If there are some people you are friendly with, you might want to ask them about that person who went ridiculous on you and if she can make your time there frustrating, because that could suck for you.\n\nYou don't need to be friends with colleagues, but it's healthy to have some good interactions with at least some people you work with. You could also explain that you aren't trying to be rude, but you're just not comfortable in a large group setting. It's not unusual.\n\nAgain, that lady is nuts!", "NTA\n\nI don't mind potlucks and I generally eat what I know I'll eat do nothing really gets wasted on my plate. \n\nThat being said, the manager was out of line insulting you for not participating. I didn't think the \"bring enough for the class\" comment applied to a workplace also where adults could either bring their own lunch or enjoy the potluck.", "NTA but, work-wise, insulting her like that (even if you\u2019re right) takes you from being without blame to part of the problem. If there\u2019s HR and they\u2019re not totally terrible, I would talk to them about this situation before she does. It\u2019s dumb that that\u2019s the case but definitely something to consider.", "NTA - These \"we're a family\" co-workers are tiring.", "NTA.. my God \n\n>, \u201cI thought everyone learned to bring enough for the class in elementary school.\u201d  \n\nWould've pissed me off. I would've lost my shit and left. Hasn't she learned to respect people, most do in elementary school.\n\n\n\n>She continued by saying that I should have just eaten in my cubicle if I was going to be antisocial and \u201cshit on\u201d the company culture.\n\nYou wanted to join the event while still comfortable. Make small talk and eat with others without having to do something that would make you uncomfortable.\n\n>She also said that I have a shitty attitude and don\u2019t belong in the department if I can\u2019t play nice with everyone.\n\nShe has a shitty attitude for getting upset at someone eating their own food because they are not comfortable with eating the food provided.", "I don't get why you didn't just eat at your desk. I feel like this was a pretty obvious problem to come up at some point. \n\n\n\nNTA of course- it is not your job to cook for people and your manager is absolut out of line. People just suck very often.", "NTA. This may be extreme, but it sounds like this woman has some sort of mental illness. Normal adult humans don\u2019t get so emotional about something so trivial\u2026 especially with the name calling. \n\nIs this lady obese? Maybe suffering from food addiction? Like, she saw your yummy food and got obsessed over having it\u2026 then lashed out cuz she couldn\u2019t have any. Similar to an alcoholic being cut off or something.", "You don\u2019t do potluck. You don\u2019t join parties. You must be joy to be around.\n\nNTA, technically.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

With the exception of an Italian I used to work with who brought her grandmother's Tiramisu recipe. But I've been to get place and it's spotless.  \n\nShe gave me the recipe but I haven't tried making it yet.  However anything that's starts off with \"2kg of mascarpone\" is a yes for me.  \n\nI now understand why the Italians I worked with made those dismissive hand gestures (as only they can) when the Olive Garden was mentioned.", "NTA this would piss me off! I too will not eat things made in others kitchens. They could have pets they don\u2019t clean up after. They could smoke in their house. Not wash there hands all kinds of things. She was way out of line.", "We had monthly themed lunches at a workplace.  I am allergic to a certain thing.  All I required was to be told what food  had it in.  However I had a work mate bi...ch  who didn't believe me, so I never ate any of her food.  Trust level zero.", "I get the potluck thing\u2014people have wildly different ideas of acceptable sanitary practices for home cooking, and food sensitivities/allergies can make pot lucks a nightmare for some people. But the rest, yeah. Sounds like the one awkward coworker I have who refuses to make small talk (even saying hi) when we are the first two people on our weekly check in webex. \nNTA. But I\u2019d agree that you should have eaten in your cubicle.", "NTA.  I can't stand this company bullshittery either.", "NTA. I hate this stuff and forced participation is ridiculous.  Complain to your manager/HR as she disrespected your boundaries, mocked you for not participating in voluntarily activity, and questioned your ability to do your job.\n\nEdited for grammer", "NTA, and your manager was super unprofessional. To be fair, your final comment was also out of line, but on the whole you have more than enough reason to take this to HR.\n\nPotlucks are a weird American custom (someone always ends up cooking a proper meal, while others bring in supermarket cupcakes). They're even weirder when they're part of work.\n\nYou do sound a bit hypersensitive to the risk of food contamination, and it sounds like you may have a more general mistrust of strangers, which goes beyond their food preparation. \n\nOf course that's your prerogative and you shouldn't be judged by your manager or anyone else for it. But this might be a sign that you should prioritize the search for a new job. \n\nI also find their company culture weird, but if the others there presumably enjoy being part of it, I can also understand if others found that your attitude to their dynamic may be cramping their style. Like for example, in the US we have a grocery chain where everyone is known to be SUPER friendly and wears Hawaiian shirts. I could NEVER work there, but if I did and people there found me to be a buzzkill, I couldn't just say \"What? I'm cordial enough and keep to myself!\" \n\n  \nFINALLY, I am confused by your comment that you don't trust your coworker's food because of your experience in restaurants. Are you implying that commercial kitchens are safer, or are you saying that the sheer horror of the average commercial kitchen has scarred you for life? 'Cause if it's the former, I (as a lifelong food worker) have bad news for you...", "Don\u2019t forget she called OP a weirdo as well! Extremely unprofessional manager, not to say weird..!
