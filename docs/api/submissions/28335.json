I lied to all of my family, and they all thought I was going to work that day, but instead, I went to the airport. I left for various reasons, like my abusive stepfather and my enabling mother. I moved 1,500 miles away and moved in with a friend, who has graciously let me stay in their home for 2 months. After I left, I received many phone calls from all family members, and thongs have been patched up with my grandparents, but they are still rocky with my mother. I recently have come into a housing issue and can't remain living here atm. I'll be moving back here in 3 months to move into a dorm room, but until then, I have to move back home. My grandmother bought me a plane ticket and is letting me stay with her until I come back. I recently told my mom I was coming back, and she was happy to see me, but upset when I said that my grandma was picking me up from the airport. I brought up the point that it's a 7 hour journey back, and I'd be super tired, but she was adamant that she picked me up. My grandmother and her haven't been getting along, and she's hesitant. I'm slightly afraid that she'll try to force me back into living with her by basically kidnapping me (which is something I would not put past her). And due to our rocky relationship, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. If she picks me up, I have a feeling that she would berate me for leaving the way I did and also bring her husband. Home and I have a terrible relationship, and he was the main reason I left, so I don't really want to see him, let alone be on a car with him. My grandma says I should do what I want to, but I'm not sure I feel safe.

You are right, your mother/SD are trying to separate you from the other family to get their hooks into you.  And a captive 7 hour ride fits their plans too neatly.

If he is not, go back into the airport, spot a security person, and call your grandmother, because while it sounds like your mother is bad he's worse.  Avoid physical proximity with him at all costs.  And if it's just your mother, call your grandmother and beg her for a ride however long it takes, because you're afraid your mother will drive you back to your horrible stepfather.\n\nI'm really sorry about all this, OP, I just hope your grandmother can see you through until you're safely away.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Be safe. As others said, meeting in public with your mother would be the way to go, if at all. If you are both trying to patch things up that's good, but boundaries need to be respected.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t even feel the least bit bad about it. You have to look out for yourself and keep yourself safe. Your grandmother seems like a good person and the much safer option. I would definitely insist she drives you home.\n\nI wish you all the best!", "NTA\n\nSweetheart, do NOT for one second consider putting your mother's feelings over your own safety. If there is even the slightest chance that she will bring an abuser back into your life then do not get into a private, confined space that she has complete control over! By all means, feel free to have a public lunch with her a few days later if you feel this relationship is worth it. But do not give her the ability to drag you back into something you might not be able to get out of again.", "NTA Trust your gut feelings, they protect. I agree with another comment that you don't give flight information to her. If she asks, tell her that she doesn't need that info.

Have grandma give you a ride, not mom.", "NTA boundaries are important to set and maintain in situations like this. This is one of your boundaries. You do not feel comfortable being alone in a car with her where she could potentially not take you to the correct destination. If she does not respect that boundary, that is a her problem, not a you problem.", "NTA.  Stop your mother in her tracks.  I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s a narcissist or just emotionally immature but there are some books you should read to learn to handle her & to prioritize yourself.
