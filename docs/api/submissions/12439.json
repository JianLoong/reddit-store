Just advice, in the future, If you need to wake up a snorer because they're driving you crazy, get up to \"find medicine for a headache\" and drop something loud.  Or start having night terrors.

Soft earplugs are a sleep saver.", "I don't think that it is wrong of her to be cautious about the traveling if you've never traveled solo. However, it is her choice of not letting you go alone. So she shouldn't blame that on you. And very shitty that you can't go to someone else with this. At least not for now. Is staying with your grandparents or dad an option when they come back? (And if that's better for you)", "I understand that at the end of the day she is still my mother, and I believe any parent would be worried to, but at the same time I am not 10 years old, i\u2019m a fully functioning teenager that isn\u2019t dumb enough and could easily blend. She has major trust for my sister to go drink and smoke and get wasted at 17, so i can\u2019t see why she wouldn\u2019t let me go on a plane alone.\n\nUnfournately my mom has fully custody of me, but my grandparents are very caring. If they were here they would help settle the situation."]}
