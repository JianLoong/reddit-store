We have been living together with these cats for at least 5 years with all of them. I pay for all of the cats' care. One of our cats has kidney disease and requires twice daily special meals with medications and IV fluids every other day. \n\nHe had loved all the cats until very recently when we had a string of finding puke everywhere. But it came to a head when someone puked on his clothes as they were on the floor while he was sleeping. He didn't notice the puke on his clothes until after he put the clothes back on. \n\nHe usually calms down from his temper between 1 to 5 hours after an incident. But he hasn't calmed down, and he didn't like it when I didn't agree to give up one or all of the cats. \n\nI can't be 100% sure which cat it was, but I'm think I know who did the one on his clothes. I caught her hiding after he lost his temper. So, I scheduled an appointment to take her to the vet tomorrow. It doesn't seem to pacify him with that. \n\nIm worried. Im going to lose my almost 7-year relationship over my cats. I don't have children, and I am 99% likely not to have kids in the future.

That's toxic. \n\nAnywho yeah cats puke. He can't expect you to dump one of them randomly because his clothes got puked on. Maybe he shouldn't leave his shit lying around.\n\nDump the boyfriend, not the cat.", "NTA- get rid of the boyfriend, keep the cats. \n\nThis is the price of animal ownership: they get old, and they get sick. And how your partner reacts to that, and how you work together around that, speaks volumes about the relationship.", "NTA. He should've put his clothes away instead of leaving them on the floor, and more importantly, he must accept the parameters of the relationship in their current form. What I mean by that is, he chose to start a relationship with you knowing you have cats. Now, as the cats start crossing the rainbow bridge, you two are obviously free to have a conversation about changing the parameters, but as it stands, the cats were in your life before the boyfriend was and he just has to accept that. And he should start picking up his clothes.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry, if you have to refer to his temper tantrums as \u201cincidents\u201d and it takes up to five hours for him to calm down, this is not a person you want to be in a relationship with. You\u2019re already managing your life according to his temper if you know his cooldown time- that is NOT okay. Also, if you had the cats first, and he\u2019s lived with them for FIVE YEARS, he needs to deal with the fact that the cats are going to  stay. Heaven help the man who thinks he will take priority over my pet - we\u2019re a package deal!", "NTA - but *WHY* are you with this clown?  You deserve *BETTER*.", "Ewww.\n\nYour BFs anger issues are all manner of red flag.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd if your relationship comes to an end, you didn't lose 7 years, you lost an AH.", "NTA. Don\u2019t think you are losing your relationship over your cats. The cats are saving you from an aggressive AH before you were tied even more to him. Those cats deserve a statue if they make you see him for who he really is.", "NTA. So one of the cats puked on his clothes, so what! It can be washed and it's his own fault he left them on the floor. Cats are gonna cat. He knew what he was signing up for when you got together, and if he wasn't okay with it, he should have not continued the relationship for 7 years. Camp cats over boyfriend here! Hope puke-y kitty is okay.", "NTA - and while I really can't say much about your relationship, it just doesn't sound like a loss, that's some red flags right there and I'd pick the cats over that relationship any day!", "This is a no brainer.  Keep the cats, lose the bf.  My cats puke.  My kids puked.  I puke.  When you are responsible for another being, sometimes you have to deal with puke. My cats are family.  A little concerning he doesnt get that.  NTA", "I had a cat who vomited a lot. Sometimes they'd vomit on things they knew we use a lot like clothes. Turned out he had advanced cancer and had to be put down, was probably trying to tell us he was sick. Healthy cats vomit but not all the time. Hopefully your vet can clear up the situation and this will resolve itself. It's one thing to deal with cat vomit once or twice but, yes, over and over and over again gets very aggravating. See what the situation is first with the cat and go from there. You didn't mention how many cats there are? If multiple cats, one with intense special health needs and one vomiting regularly, I can see how the bf would get fed up with cats.  Also, maybe he doesn't feel the same way about cats as child substitutes so might not be as emotionally attached as you are to them. NTA", "NTA.\n\nDo *not* choose this man over your cats. No one who actually respects you or your pets would ever demand that of you in a reasonable situation (aka you care for them and clean up after them, and don't have more pets than you can manage). \n\nWhat'll he demand you change next time? Your hair? Your wardrobe? Your car? Your personality?\n\nI know you love him and you may think \"this time he'll get over it and stay calm\", or even \"I can handle this\". But you shouldn't have to. Your cats shouldn't have to live in fear. Neither should you.\n\nI left a 7 year relationship because of disrespect like this. It is possible, and though it's hard it really makes everything easier once there is no more yelling.", "NTA\n\nPets grow old and get sick. He didn't really love all the cats, they just didn't get in his way before, you already said you took care of everything. The massive temper here is a huge red flag, but do consider that if you plan on being with him forever, then even if you win this battle on these cats, he will fight tooth and nail to prevent you ever getting another one.", "Why would you keep clothes on the floor if you have a sick pet? NTA", "NTA - he is over reacting and shouldn't be throwing his clothes in the floor anyways. Imagine if a spider was hiding in them...", "1 his fault he left clothing on the floor. \n2 his temper tantrums are rages and sound abusive\n3 take the cats over the man every time", "NTA but you're likely going to have to think long and hard about the alternative.

Honestly, what would happen if heaven forbid, you got sick and starting vomiting everywhere? Is he going to blow his temper at *you*?", "NTA. The cats were there first if you've had them 7 years.

Both my boyfriend and his dad have expressed interest in getting more, but I told them that if they wanted another one, they would have to financially cover for that said pet. I financially support all three. I don't think the one with kidney disease was the one vomiting based on the location and timing of the vomit. Funny enough, the one I think who is vomiting is the one that hasn't had a history of vomiting. \n\nThe kidney disease cat may vomit if he is dehydrated, and the other cat used to vomit up her food because her stomach couldn't tolerate it. This was over 2 years ago, and we had to keep trying new food brands and flavors. In that time period, that cat puked much more than what we are currently seeing. Which was once or twice a day versus 3 times in a week. \n\nHe was mad that with all the care I get for them, they are still puking. I explained that I hadn't taken them to get seen for the most recent situation because I wasn't told about the other vomiting he found.", "Oh, he wanted another in the past year, but I told him if he wanted it, he would have to financially support it. My kidney disease cat's care can get expensive, so Im not willing to get another pet in case if it becomes a special needs animal, too.
