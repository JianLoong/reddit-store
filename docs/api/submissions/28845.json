{"id": 28845, "submission_id": "1772fm7", "title": "AITA for wanting to keep my cats?", "selftext": "So my boyfriend, who didn't have much interaction with cats prior to living together, declared last night that he wanted at least one of the cats gone. We have been living together with these cats for at least 5 years with all of them. I pay for all of the cats' care. One of our cats has kidney disease and requires twice daily special meals with medications and IV fluids every other day. \n\nHe had loved all the cats until very recently when we had a string of finding puke everywhere. But it came to a head when someone puked on his clothes as they were on the floor while he was sleeping. He didn't notice the puke on his clothes until after he put the clothes back on. \n\nHe usually calms down from his temper between 1 to 5 hours after an incident. But he hasn't calmed down, and he didn't like it when I didn't agree to give up one or all of the cats. \n\nI can't be 100% sure which cat it was, but I'm think I know who did the one on his clothes. I caught her hiding after he lost his temper. So, I scheduled an appointment to take her to the vet tomorrow. It doesn't seem to pacify him with that. \n\nIm worried. Im going to lose my almost 7-year relationship over my cats. I don't have children, and I am 99% likely not to have kids in the future. I'm fully disabled, so between me and my boyfriend's dad (who lives with us), my boyfriend only helps when we need someone to pick up the slack.\n\n****Update: So I finally got him to talk, and it wasn't always about the cat puke. He complained about how he was doing so much with nothing in return. Then he told me I wasn't feminine enough to turn him on, and I was too much of a girl boss. After some really bad years, I started doing really well and kicking ass like graduating with Summa Cum Laude. He never really seemed that excited for me. \n\nWe had a few fights in the last few fights, and Im done. Thankfully, I own the house I live in (and not him), so I just asked him to give me the log information so I can pay for the things he pays for.  I also packed some of his stuff up and put it in the living room. He came in the relationship with the mattress and bed frame, Im waiting to find out what he wants to do with that.\n\n\n**** Update: This fight definitely opened up all the other problems in the relationship. He said I'm not feminine enough, too feminist, and too much of a girl boss. After a few rough years for me, I was finally having success, like graduating college with Summa Cum Laude or placing in a film festival. He never really acted happy for me when they happened. So I'm done. I know plenty of people who love me for who I am, and I am certainly not living with a toxic person.", "created_utc": 1697213815, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1772fm7/aita_for_wanting_to_keep_my_cats/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And how your partner reacts to that, and how you work together around that, speaks volumes about the relationship.", "NTA. He should've put his clothes away instead of leaving them on the floor, and more importantly, he must accept the parameters of the relationship in their current form. What I mean by that is, he chose to start a relationship with you knowing you have cats. Now, as the cats start crossing the rainbow bridge, you two are obviously free to have a conversation about changing the parameters, but as it stands, the cats were in your life before the boyfriend was and he just has to accept that. And he should start picking up his clothes.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry, if you have to refer to his temper tantrums as \u201cincidents\u201d and it takes up to five hours for him to calm down, this is not a person you want to be in a relationship with. You\u2019re already managing your life according to his temper if you know his cooldown time- that is NOT okay. Also, if you had the cats first, and he\u2019s lived with them for FIVE YEARS, he needs to deal with the fact that the cats are going to  stay.

Turned out he had advanced cancer and had to be put down, was probably trying to tell us he was sick. Healthy cats vomit but not all the time. Hopefully your vet can clear up the situation and this will resolve itself. It's one thing to deal with cat vomit once or twice but, yes, over and over and over again gets very aggravating. See what the situation is first with the cat and go from there. You didn't mention how many cats there are? If multiple cats, one with intense special health needs and one vomiting regularly, I can see how the bf would get fed up with cats.  Also, maybe he doesn't feel the same way about cats as child substitutes so might not be as emotionally attached as you are to them. NTA", "NTA.\n\nDo *not* choose this man over your cats.

Funny enough, the one I think who is vomiting is the one that hasn't had a history of vomiting. \n\nThe kidney disease cat may vomit if he is dehydrated, and the other cat used to vomit up her food because her stomach couldn't tolerate it. This was over 2 years ago, and we had to keep trying new food brands and flavors. In that time period, that cat puked much more than what we are currently seeing. Which was once or twice a day versus 3 times in a week. \n\nHe was mad that with all the care I get for them, they are still puking.

If they\u2019re wearable again he can fold them and put them on a chair or hang them up.\n\nGet the cat checked out by a vet (it sounds like you are) but if the cat is aging it could be as simple as daily brushing to alleviate the puking issue. Sometimes when they get older they can\u2019t groom as well as they should or they get hairballs more easily.\n\nAlso, if he chooses to leave because you won\u2019t abandon some of the cats that he agreed to living with 5 years ago, then that\u2019s on him and not on you. He knew what the situation was 5 years ago. He doesn\u2019t get to change the parameters now: pets are for the life of the pets. You don\u2019t get rid of a pet because it becomes inconvenient, and if he\u2019s the type of person who does, do you really want to be with someone like that? If you give in to this, you will be compromising your core values and for what? To stay with someone who doesn\u2019t align with your values? Being single for a while might suck but it would be better than being tied to someone who isn\u2019t on the same page in matters of basic ethics.\n\nAnd honestly I can\u2019t see why you are putting up with him using his tantrums to basically terrorize you into compromising your values. If you are calling his temper tantrums \u201cincidents\u201d and it\u2019s taking hours to calm himself in a normal situation, he needs to go to therapy. Again, if he wants to leave because you aren\u2019t going to get rid of beloved companion animals for *checks notes* aging, then he is free to do so.
