What an ass.", "NTA.\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes.\n\nOliver had his wedding on Lana's birthday intentionally. Lana can't change the day she was born but she could change the birthday party but why should she? Because her uncle Oliver is an AH? I wouldn't change it either.\n\nOliver put everyone in the position to choose. To be fair, your wife split the duties with you. He can't be mad because he created this divide. Shame on Oliver for being a massive selfish AH. He could have chosen his wedding on Luke's birthday since his beef is with his brother. Why take it out on a kid?", "NTA, Oliver started this by choosing that date for his wedding. Lana and Luke did not choose what day Lana was born. Oliver had a choice to be a jerk and he took it. Not only did Lana not have that choice, she is sixteen, holding her to the same standards as a 40-year-old man is absurd. Oliver is feuding with a literal teenager that he chose to hurt to get back at her father. That is abusive behavior, good people do not weaponize children.\n\nYou already did more than is required of you by you and your wife splitting up and going to both events, even though Oliver is clearly in the wrong.\n\nIt seems like being neutral isn't good enough for Oliver, who will continue to act childishly and harm his niece and then expect you to condone his behavior or he'll refuse to talk to you.\n\nWell, I guess you know why Luke doesn't like his brother now, eh?", "NTA. I think you and your wife handled it the best you could. A parent present at both events. \n\nWhile I typically agree that weddings are more important than birthdays, scheduling it day of the birthday after you explicitly asked them not to was just inconsiderate towards you. Never mind that they are punishing an actual child for a feud they\u2019re having with the parents. \n\nI think your solution was the best one available given the circumstances.", "Sounds like Oliver doesn\u2019t get along with very many people.\nNTA - that title belongs to Oliver.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like Oliver wanted to make you choose you did and so now he doesn't speak to you.

I'm not judging that she did anything wrong - that's her choice and I don't know any more of the family dynamic than what you've shared. From my own experience and beliefs, if I were in your wife's position, I wouldn't have have gone to the wedding either. I just would not want my son thinking he deserves any support in choosing to do things to break our family apart.", "NTA \n\nOliver obviously did this on purpose to be spiteful.

It was the only fair solution.", "NTA, your granddaughter is more important than your son who is having his second wedding on his niece's birthday", "NTA\n\nOliver and his partner chose their wedding date knowing it was his niece\u2019s birthday.

You haven't said their name or even their gender.  \n   \nYou claim he chose the wedding date to be petty but that's not how people generally choose an important event like this, especially one they'll celebrate annually.  \n  \nYou've also repeatedly said you prefer your grandchild over him.   \n  \nThere are a lot of missing reasons here, but it reads as though Luke is the favourite, and therefore Lana is also prioritised over Oliver.  \n  \nI'm not surprised Oliver is not talking to you. I'd be very interested to hear his side.", "NTA hilarious", "NTA-Might be time to discuss inheritance and rewriting of the wills.  If you can get them both in the same room with you no spouse\u2019s or grandchildren then have the discussion about pulling BS like this.  \n\nYou did it the best way to divide and conquer.  Great job.  Now tell the two of them they don\u2019t have to get along at all but them putting you and your wife in this type of situation is petty.  Now either they knock it off or you will not go to either events if this happens in the future.  If one side won\u2019t back down then it will cost them. \n\nIf they want to act like children treat them like it.  Find something that will make them hurt and metaphorically squeeze.", "NTA.  If they both have the same day, then you and your wife going to the events separately is a legitimate way to dou the parental flag.", "NTA\n\nWedding invitations are not summons. \n\nI would have gone to the birthday party over sitting through a boring wedding any day.\n\nYour wife bit the bullet, but I would have still said NTA even if she too had skipped the wedding and gone to the birthday party.\n\nNote:  I am ancient, and I have never been to a second wedding for anybody.  If the first one didn't take, why should anyone think the second one will?\n\nYou can always go to Oliver's third wedding.", "YTA There seems to be a lot of pettiness on all sides here, but a wedding is more important than a birthday. Your granddaughter could easily have moved her party to the following day. It is way more complicated to change the date of a wedding. One must consider the amount of guests, availability of the venue etc. \n\nAre you even sure that your son picked their wedding date based on his niece's birthday? You haven't even bothered to ask, just assumed. I also don't know any 16 year olds whose birthday would be ruined if their granddad didn't attend ... most celebrate with friends at that age. Kind of get the feeling that you favor your older son and his family over Oliver.", "Yes. YTA. I think you were intentionally. Weddings trump birthdays, even 16th birthdays. You and your wife could have dropped by Lana\u2019s party before or after the wedding and given her a nice gift. But you needed to attend your son\u2019s wedding.   \n\n\nI can not help suspecting some of the reason your sons can not stand each other is that their dad played favorites.", "ESH\n\nIt sounds like Oliver deliberately chose this date because he knew it was Luke's child's birthday. Or were there only a few dates available and this was the only date that most of the important guests could make it? Assuming he had other suitable options, he's the ahole for choosing this date.\n\nI am guessing Lana wasn't invited to Oliver's wedding considering Luke wasn't invited. That's a shitty thing for Oliver to do: even if he can't stand Luke, surely he'd want a relationship with his niece and perhaps she could have come to the wedding by herself/with other family.\n\nBut Lana knew about the date and knew that a lot of family probably would want to attend the wedding. With that knowledge, she should have realised that she'd put a lot of family members in an awkward position by forcing them to choose between a wedding and a birthday. (I don't know whether 16 is a big milestone, it isn't in my culture.)\n\nI understand why Oliver is not talking to you as you went to a grand child's birthday party over his wedding. Sure, it was his second wedding and it sounds like he knew the dates would clash (and possibly chose that date specifically for the clash but we don't know that as we didn't hear his side of the story), but you didn't turn up so yeah he is upset with you.\n\nI do understand that you wanted to attend your grand child's birthday party but she could have chosen a different day as usually a birthday party has way fewer moving parts than a wedding. It is entirely possible that the birthday was otherwise the best date for all the important guests to attend the wedding and I can't fault someone for choosing the most suitable date for the most people that are the closest to them, for attendance at their wedding. Even if Oliver had a close relationship with Lana, wedding planning can be so challenging that I personally wouldn't consider the birthday of a nibling to make a date unsuitable for my own wedding.", "YTA\n\nA 16 year old's birthday is only special to 16 year olds.  Ignoring a son's wedding for a grand-daughter's birthday, that's ridiculous honestly and show's serious favoritism towards one son.  I'd be insulted if I were Oliver.", "YTA\n\nWeddings always trump birthdays \n\nNot attending a wedding (as a parent) indicates that you don't approve of the union - at least that's what I believe and I would be devastated if my parent did this", "It's not reasonable to expect someone to change their wedding date because one of the guests has a conflict. Even second weddings require planning and I seriously doubt they chose the date they did \"for no reason\".\n\nI'm not going to call you an ah but you really shouldn't be surprised that Oliver isn't talking to you. I think the daughter should have changed the date, but instead she forced you to choose her over Oliver, for no reason.", "YTA birthdays are every year and 16 isn\u2019t that special you chose your action and get a reaction wouldn\u2019t surprise me if your relation is strained for the rest of their marriage", "ESH. Everyone is kind of in the wrong here. But I think your wife and you did the best you could, one went to the wedding, the other to the birthday. Typically wedding venues are booked far in advance, some even years in advance, how sure are you that Oliver didn't pick this date because there were no other dates available? I mean, if it was just a backyard thing or something, then, yeah he definitely did this to spite his brother, but if not, you can't know for sure. But either way, he seems to be very spiteful and not understanding at all, that you want to support your grandkids as well as your sons and that's why your wife and you split it all up, unnecessary to be so spiteful. A real pity that the brothers don't get along at all, which would be fine, if they just ignored each other's existence, but to spit one another like this... Not good. And the fact that your grand daughter didn't want to back down either, just shows me that she grew up around talk of \"how awful uncle oliver is\" otherwise I'm convinced she would have just moved her birthday.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's gonna get married again cause his wife won't be able to stand him.

If both of Oliver's parents had skipped the wedding for the birthday then it would be a completely different story. They did not do so; one went to the wedding and one went to the birthday, which was pretty much the only fair way to handle this idiocy. And instead of being a grownup and being happy that his mom attended, Oliver chose to throw a hissyfit.", "Of he is so estranged from his brother that he doesn\u2019t invite him to his wedding I doubt that he keeps track of his brother\u2019s children\u2019s Birthdays", ">otherwise how would Lana already have birthday plans? \n\nOh, I dunno, it's not like her birthday doesn't happen on the same date every year, or that 16 isn't what most people consider a milestone birthday and planning often starts early for those.", "If they were in good terms I could see that but since they downright hate each other, I could see someone doing this to be petty. This is was the one and only date available? M I think the OP made the best choice available. One went to the wedding and one to the birthday. The fact that a grown adult is upset that one of his parents went to their grandchild\u2019s birthday party says a lot.", "Except any reasonable person would state those reasons when asked to change the date because of niece's birthday. Giving \"no reasons\" may be simply that, no reason other than deliberately making sure the family chooses between the birthday and the wedding. It's a dick move. NTA", "That\u2019s fine and all if they genuinely couldn\u2019t pick another date (which is probably BS.) But the fact that Oliver is upset instead of understanding is telling. He\u2019s mad that the 16 year old\u2019s bday was chosen over his wedding, but I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t give a damn that his wedding caused other family members to have to choose him over the niece.", "Then given his previous history Oliver should've provided proof that it wasn't malicious, but he didn't. There is absolutely nothing here to suggest that it was anything other than him choosing to be a dick.", "Question, why would you choose the date of your niece's birthday to do your wedding? Maybe I'm an idiot, but the venues don't give you certain dates that are available? Then, if this was a test, why the 40 year old son don't tell their parents \"the date was decided because the disponibility of the venue\" or something like that and get angry when people don't come?", "There are hundreds of comments on this thread. I have not read them all.\n\nAs far as OP's statements as to Oliver's motives, OP does not strike me as a reliable narrator. There's obviously stuff he is not telling us, and he is obviously telling the story with a bias. \n\nI am always wary when someone narrating a story of this sort doesn't tell us what was actually said, but instead just makes question-begging summarizing statements like 'there was no reason' or 'there was nothing special about this date\". It's Oliver's wedding. However much OP may look down on second marriages, a marriage is a big deal. I would be really surprised if Oliver deliberately chose a date specifically to set up a contest between himself and his niece, especially knowing his father adores the niece and doesn't think much of him (unless maybe an excuse to go nc was the whole point).\n\nOliver's reasons for choosing the date he did is key to the whole problem, but OP avoids telling us anything - instead he just tells us what conclusion to draw, instead of describing the facts and letting the evidence guide the verdict. That just seems really questionable to me.", "I mean, we shouldn\u2019t need to scour the comments to get information. \n\nI always side eye information that comes out in the comments that\u2019s important and changes things. Weekday weddings are unusual and it seems like something important you would include in the post.", "> It\u2019s why I said Oliver didn\u2019t give any reasons for the date.\n\nRight but did he actually say \"nnnnnnnno. there's no reason why but I just won't change. I could change but nnnnnno.\" OR did he say \"look ma it just worked out that way and I can't change it\" without elaborating further? Both could be construed as not giving a reason. But just because he didn't give a reason doesn't mean he didn't have a reason. It just means he didn't explain the ins and outs of scheduling his entire wedding. Which, he doesn't need to.\n\nedit: What's in the post is that OP has decided it was malicious intent and OP has decided that OP isn't an asshole, but if you just want to agree with whatever OP writes then there's no reason to even judge. Just let OP tell you who was TA and then we don't need to comment, right? \"I'm NTA, AITA?\" Ope well it's in the post that you're NTA so I guess you're all good.", "Again, you are really over reacting to simply not talking to someone and being called an asshole. He\u2019s not kicking and screaming, not melting down, not going public and causing drama With family. He simply Called them an asshole and is taking space. \n\nIf that\u2019s your definition of a hissy fit, what\u2019s a tantrum in your opinion? Someone telling you \u201cNo I don\u2019t want to do that\u201d? \n\nIf a person at a restaurant sends their order back because it was burnt are they being a Karen? \n\nYou\u2019re really stretching the definition of what happened here.", "It is possible. We don't know how long they have been fighting, if he even knows his niece, it's rather sad that grown adults can't put aside their  differences for family though."]}
