He chose his wedding date on the exact same day as Lana's birthday. We told him not to do this but he was determined to do it for no reason at all. Luke wasn't invited to the wedding.\n\nOliver doesn't like Luke, so he tries to punish Luke's daughter by choosing that date? What an ass.", "NTA.\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes.\n\nOliver had his wedding on Lana's birthday intentionally. Lana can't change the day she was born but she could change the birthday party but why should she? Because her uncle Oliver is an AH? I wouldn't change it either.\n\nOliver put everyone in the position to choose. To be fair, your wife split the duties with you. He can't be mad because he created this divide. Shame on Oliver for being a massive selfish AH. He could have chosen his wedding on Luke's birthday since his beef is with his brother. Why take it out on a kid?", "NTA, Oliver started this by choosing that date for his wedding. Lana and Luke did not choose what day Lana was born. Oliver had a choice to be a jerk and he took it. Not only did Lana not have that choice, she is sixteen, holding her to the same standards as a 40-year-old man is absurd. Oliver is feuding with a literal teenager that he chose to hurt to get back at her father. That is abusive behavior, good people do not weaponize children.\n\nYou already did more than is required of you by you and your wife splitting up and going to both events, even though Oliver is clearly in the wrong.\n\nIt seems like being neutral isn't good enough for Oliver, who will continue to act childishly and harm his niece and then expect you to condone his behavior or he'll refuse to talk to you.\n\nWell, I guess you know why Luke doesn't like his brother now, eh?", "NTA. I think you and your wife handled it the best you could. A parent present at both events. \n\nWhile I typically agree that weddings are more important than birthdays, scheduling it day of the birthday after you explicitly asked them not to was just inconsiderate towards you. Never mind that they are punishing an actual child for a feud they\u2019re having with the parents. \n\nI think your solution was the best one available given the circumstances.", "Sounds like Oliver doesn\u2019t get along with very many people.\nNTA - that title belongs to Oliver.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like Oliver wanted to make you choose you did and so now he doesn't speak to you. Ask something you don't want the answer to then you shouldn't ask the question.\n\nSend him a text/email explaining your side, apologise that this hurt him but he made this situation occur and you would make the same decision again for the same reasons. Then it is on him to fix not you.", "NTA\n\nOliver is he did this out of spite and to make it as difficult as possible.\n\nOliver is a massive AH", "NTA\n\nThank you for not punishing your 16 year old granddaughter for the spite of your 40 year old son.\n\nPersonally, if I was your wife, I'd've gone to the birthday party as well. I'm not judging that she did anything wrong - that's her choice and I don't know any more of the family dynamic than what you've shared. From my own experience and beliefs, if I were in your wife's position, I wouldn't have have gone to the wedding either. I just would not want my son thinking he deserves any support in choosing to do things to break our family apart.", "NTA \n\nOliver obviously did this on purpose to be spiteful. You picked the right event.", "NTA - he didn't invite her dad and had it on her 16th B-day, possibly ***the*** milestone birthday", "NTA. You and your wife each went to one important event. It was the only fair solution.", "NTA, your granddaughter is more important than your son who is having his second wedding on his niece's birthday", "NTA\n\nOliver and his partner chose their wedding date knowing it was his niece\u2019s birthday.  That makes Oliver an AH.\n\nYou and your wife had to find some way to make appearances at both, so you went to one and her to the other.", "I mean it sounds like you went to the kids birthday because you like her better than your son.", "NTA \n\nYou and your wife handled this with equanimity. Maybe for the third wedding you swap?", "NTA.  He made a choice and so did you.", "Totally NTA- Luke did this on purpose to cause an issue. You did absolutely nothing wrong. A person only turns 16 once where as your son could get married any number of times", "NTA. Go to his third wedding. No one that petty and immature stays married for long /s", "NTA, I'm glad at least one of you went to each event.", "YTA  \n  \nYou've made clear in the comments that you disapprove of Oliver's wedding - can you tell us about the person he is marrying? You haven't said their name or even their gender.  \n   \nYou claim he chose the wedding date to be petty but that's not how people generally choose an important event like this, especially one they'll celebrate annually.  \n  \nYou've also repeatedly said you prefer your grandchild over him.   \n  \nThere are a lot of missing reasons here, but it reads as though Luke is the favourite, and therefore Lana is also prioritised over Oliver.  \n  \nI'm not surprised Oliver is not talking to you. I'd be very interested to hear his side.", "NTA hilarious", "NTA-Might be time to discuss inheritance and rewriting of the wills.  If you can get them both in the same room with you no spouse\u2019s or grandchildren then have the discussion about pulling BS like this.  \n\nYou did it the best way to divide and conquer.  Great job.  Now tell the two of them they don\u2019t have to get along at all but them putting you and your wife in this type of situation is petty.  Now either they knock it off or you will not go to either events if this happens in the future.  If one side won\u2019t back down then it will cost them. \n\nIf they want to act like children treat them like it.  Find something that will make them hurt and metaphorically squeeze.", "NTA.  If they both have the same day, then you and your wife going to the events separately is a legitimate way to dou the parental flag.", "NTA\n\nWedding invitations are not summons. \n\nI would have gone to the birthday party over sitting through a boring wedding any day.\n\nYour wife bit the bullet, but I would have still said NTA even if she too had skipped the wedding and gone to the birthday party.\n\nNote:  I am ancient, and I have never been to a second wedding for anybody.  If the first one didn't take, why should anyone think the second one will?\n\nYou can always go to Oliver's third wedding.", "YTA There seems to be a lot of pettiness on all sides here, but a wedding is more important than a birthday. Your granddaughter could easily have moved her party to the following day. It is more complicated to change the date of a wedding. One must consider the amount of guests, availability of the venue etc. Are you even sure that your son picked their wedding date based on his niece's birthday? I also don't know any 16 year olds whose birthday would be ruined if their granddad didn't attend ... Kind of get the feeling that you favor your older son and his family over Oliver.", "Yes. YTA. I think you were intentionally. Weddings trump birthdays, even 16th birthdays. You and your wife could have dropped by Lana\u2019s party before or after the wedding and given her a nice gift. But you needed to attend your son\u2019s wedding.   \n\n\nI can not help suspecting some of the reason your sons can not stand each other is that their dad played favorites.", "ESH\n\nIt sounds like Oliver deliberately chose this date because he knew it was Luke's child's birthday. Or were there only a few dates available and this was the only date that most of the important guests could make it? Assuming he had other suitable options, he's the ahole for choosing this date.\n\nI am guessing Lana wasn't invited to Oliver's wedding considering Luke wasn't invited. That's a shitty thing for Oliver to do: even if he can't stand Luke, surely he'd want a relationship with his niece and perhaps she could have come to the wedding by herself/with other family.\n\nBut Lana knew about the date and knew that a lot of family probably would want to attend the wedding. With that knowledge, she should have realised that she'd put a lot of family members in an awkward position by forcing them to choose between a wedding and a birthday. (I don't know whether 16 is a big milestone, it isn't in my culture.)\n\nI understand why Oliver is not talking to you as you went to a grand child's birthday party over his wedding. Sure, it was his second wedding and it sounds like he knew the dates would clash (and possibly chose that date specifically for the clash but we don't know that as we didn't hear his side of the story), but you didn't turn up so yeah he is upset with you.\n\nI do understand that you wanted to attend your grand child's birthday party but she could have chosen a different day as usually a birthday party has way fewer moving parts than a wedding. It is entirely possible that the birthday was otherwise the best date for all the important guests to attend the wedding and I can't fault someone for choosing the most suitable date for the most people that are the closest to them, for attendance at their wedding. Even if Oliver had a close relationship with Lana, wedding planning can be so challenging that I personally wouldn't consider the birthday of a nibling to make a date unsuitable for my own wedding.", "YTA\n\nA 16 year old's birthday is only special to 16 year olds.  Ignoring a son's wedding for a grand-daughter's birthday, that's ridiculous honestly and show's serious favoritism towards one son.  I'd be insulted if I were Oliver.", "YTA\n\nWeddings always trump birthdays \n\nNot attending a wedding (as a parent) indicates that you don't approve of the union - at least that's what I believe and I would be devastated if my parent did this", "It's not reasonable to expect someone to change their wedding date because one of the guests has a conflict. Even second weddings require planning and I seriously doubt they chose the date they did \"for no reason\".\n\nI'm not going to call you an ah but you really shouldn't be surprised that Oliver isn't talking to you. I think the daughter should have changed the date, but instead she forced you to choose her over Oliver, for no reason.", "YTA birthdays are every year and 16 isn\u2019t that special you chose your action and get a reaction wouldn\u2019t surprise me if your relation is strained for the rest of their marriage", "ESH. Everyone is kind of in the wrong here. But I think your wife and you did the best you could, one went to the wedding, the other to the birthday. Typically wedding venues are booked far in advance, some even years in advance, how sure are you that Oliver didn't pick this date because there were no other dates available? I mean, if it was just a backyard thing or something, then, yeah he definitely did this to spite his brother, but if not, you can't know for sure. But either way, he seems to be very spiteful and not understanding at all, that you want to support your grandkids as well as your sons and that's why your wife and you split it all up, unnecessary to be so spiteful. A real pity that the brothers don't get along at all, which would be fine, if they just ignored each other's existence, but to spit one another like this... Not good. And the fact that your grand daughter didn't want to back down either, just shows me that she grew up around talk of \"how awful uncle oliver is\" otherwise I'm convinced she would have just moved her birthday.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's gonna get married again cause his wife won't be able to stand him. And even though Luke and Oliver don't talk it was STILL a dick move not to invite him to the wedding.", "\u201cHe was determined to do this for no reason at all\u201d\n\n- is this fact? Or your understanding? \n\nTypically weddings are planned in advance, and frequently not many dates available to choose. \n\nYou seemed to have determined this date was picked specifically to spite his brother, but I\u2019m unsure how you are determining that? \n\n\nEither way, YTA. You just intentionally slighted your new daughter in law by not attending their wedding. Her family now thinks you\u2019re an asshole for snubbing the wedding, your son has every right to be upset with you. \n\nYou valued a teenagers birthday party over a wedding. Stupid stupid stupid decision.", "YTA. Weddings beat birthdays. Unless he was marring the same person as the first go, then you saying you already went to his first wedding is meaningless.", "NTA Oliver is the clear AH, while your wife is at least a partial for going to the wedding instead of her granddaughter's birthday. Birthdays are the same every year, and I am sure your wife knows that.", "YTA and obviously hate your son.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
