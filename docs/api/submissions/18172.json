Looking for genuine insight if I\u2019m being unreasonable.  I love my boyfriend and this isn\u2019t the hill I want to die on.  \n\nMy [30F] birthday is on a Saturday this summer.  My boyfriend\u2019s [32M] birthday is a couple of days later.  I mentioned this week that it might be fun to do a weekend trip to celebrate our birthdays, as this is our first year together.  He said he was glad I brought it up, as for the last five years he had been having a co-birthday party with his roommate [26M] usually the weekend before or after their actual birthdays.  He said there was \u201cnothing set in stone\u201d yet, but they had been tentatively planning on celebrating the Saturday before.  AKA my actual birthday.  He offered to group me in to the celebration when he saw how quickly I deflated.  \n\nI asked if he could talk to his roommate about celebrating the following weekend instead.  I said that even if he didn\u2019t want to do a trip, I still wanted to do my own thing for my day.   He said he would bring it up to his roommate but this had been tradition for five years, and seemed kind of taken aback that I wasn\u2019t immediately on board.  I acknowledged the tradition, but also pointed out he hadn\u2019t had a girlfriend for those five years, and hadn\u2019t been trying to throw his own party on her actual birthday.  I told him it made me feel like an afterthought.  \n\nHe ended up leaving rather than staying the night and canceling our date the next day.  He says it\u2019s because he\u2019s tired after a weekend trip, but I have this awful feeling in my gut that it\u2019s because of our conversation.  \n\nTLDR: my boyfriend wants to continue his tradition of co-birthday celebration with his roommate, but chose my actual birthday for the party.

You deserve someone who at least makes your birthday about you. Damn.", "NTA. I think this isn't a match. He seems to be I'm partybro mode and you want a different type of celebration on your actual birthday, not being added to theirs.", ">usually the weekend before or after their actual birthdays.\n\nProblem solved. They do their party the next weekend.\n\nEdit to add judgement: NAH. You two can easily talk this out with the above being a thing.", "NTA: He's a 32 year old dude blowing you/your birthday off to have a joint birthday party with his younger friend that he could easy do the following week. You can do better.", "Nta\n\nHe says they do it either the weekend before OR after. Sooooooooooo why don\u2019t they do it the weekend after, per tradition? \n\nIt honestly sounds like he didn\u2019t even realize it was your birthday, and then got butt hurt that you didn\u2019t immediately get excited about just being grouped into his tradition with his roommate. \n\nIt\u2019s totally reasonable for you to want to spend your actual birthday celebrating your birthday with your boyfriend. \n\nIf he\u2019s inflexible, and doesn\u2019t want to change what he\u2019s doing, that\u2019s his choice, but it\u2019s also your choice to say, \u201ccool, I\u2019m gonna do my own thing for my birthday. Enjoy your party!\u201d Go to the spa, take a girls trip, just celebrate you.\n\nI\u2019m not going to say \u2018dump him!\u2019 over this, but maybe evaluate where you stand on his \u2018list of importance\u2019 and what you want go forward.", "NTA. I am also in a double leo relationship and I can relate.   \nYou aren't asking too much to ask them to do it the weekend after yours, if they can make it work.   \nLEOS LIKE TO BE CELEBRATED! I get it. You want your own party/special thing with your partner, not to just be lumped in with his existing party.   \nTry selling it this way: He gets two birthday parties and gets to extend his birthday into two weekends if he goes on the trip with you one weekend to co-celebrate with you, and then gets to co-celebrate with roomie the next.  Any leo will be happy to get two birthday weekends!  \nHowever, if it doesn't work for roomie's schedule for some reason, is there anyway you would feel comfortable switching the weekends and getting your trip the next? You could also get co-celebrated with the boyfriend/roomie party during weekend 1, and then get your own weekend 2. That way you also get two parties and get to extend your birthday week as well.", "NTA. Your birthday is clearly special to you, and there\u2019s a clear other option (the next weekend) for his plan. \n\nI\u2019m not gonna jump to saying your bf is an AH based on this, but I\u2019d take a look at your relationship from a wider lens. His response to this situation is weird. I get that they have a tradition, but he said it could also be the next weekend. \n\nHonestly, this post kind of reminds me of behaviors of my ex-boyfriend. When I stepped back from that relationship, I realized that he was constantly putting me second to his friends and just generally not respecting me. I hope that\u2019s not the case for you!", "NTA.\nI\u2019m not normally in the big celebrations for adult birthdays. I think it\u2019s a bit odd.\n\nHowever, you are actually being completely reasonable:\n- The tradition has been before or after.\n- Your actual birthday is on a Saturday, which is sort of like gold. \n- And it\u2019s a milestone in the sense that will be the first one you celebrated together as a couple.\n\nThis could\u2019ve been so easily solved by him just saying, \u201cOh I didn\u2019t realize your birthday was actually on that Saturday when Roommate & I were brainstorming. You\u2019re right we\u2019ll just move it to a week later. Let\u2019s plan something fun!\u201d", "Right now NAH. You want to do something special with him on your actual birthday. For him and his roommate, your birthday happens to be the day that it seems like it would be most convenient for them to continue their tradition, which seems to be important to them. \n\nIf he and his roommate can't change the actual date of their celebration for whatever reason (assuming something like a scheduling conflict or something), can't you and your boyfriend just do something for your birthday the weekend before or after? Then you can spend your actual birthday either grouped into their little tradition, or you can celebrate your day with your with friends and/or family.\n\n1 year together dating doesn't necessarily trump his roommate/close friend of 5 years, like it or not. I understand your disappointment. But IMO this is not the hill to die on at this point in your relationship.", "NAH. It's really reasonable that he wants to keep up this tradition, and reasonable that you want to do your own thing and feel celebrated.", "ESH until you all talk together and figure it out. This is a lot of drama over birthdays which happen every year. Is this how it will be every single year?", "Nah, but you should think about why you feel the day is important. Do you feel like it's a competition with his roommate? Or that he should put your birthday wishes above his own? Maybe ask yourself how you would feel if he had first suggested a romantic getaway for the weekend after your birthday. Would the specific date matter in that event?\n\nYour birthdays are always going to conflict. You have to figure out whether the specific day is that important to you - in which case tell him that - or whether there's an underlying insecurity you need to address.", "NAH. \nThey're working with their schedules and you want them to work with yours. \nIt's been my experience that the last person in the group is the odd one out and pushing for change usually ends up with the pusher being pushed out one way or another.\nThe hill is already there at this point. Someone's gonna croak on it sooner or later.", "NAH - Man talk about unlucky, finds himself a GF with a close birthday. Eh just work it out, we don't have the stenographer readout of the conversation so it's hard to say what was said and what tone. You've said yourself that his friendships are important to him (I get that aspect a lot, my friends are my chosen family) so it's important to be respectful of that and not give off the impression you're trying to wedge that stuff out. I've had a GF do that, not saying you're doing it, but be conscious of that aspect. Like I said this advice is really dependent on how the initial conversation went and what got said, you know that so apply grains of salt to my statement as needed (for taste). \n\nBut it really does sound like there's plenty of room to compromise and find something fun y'all wanna do, so just go into with flexibility and I don't think you'll be disappointed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Based on the comments this is exactly how I\u2019m going to present it.  If they can switch the weekend that would be preferable, if not I expect a fancy \u201cbirthday girl\u201d crown or something silly at the party and then something special with just us the next weekend.  \n\nThis is absolutely not a deal breaker for me.

I really like all of his friends and would be happy to be alongside of them while we celebrate.  I\u2019d just like to have my own day as well, even if it\u2019s a different weekend.  But I can\u2019t expect him to know how I feel or think about things if I don\u2019t say anything, either", "The question is, when does their relationship trump the friendship? Does 2 years trump 6 years of friendship? Will 3 trump 7? What if they decide to have kids and op is pregnant, is her birthday still going to be grouped in with the annual rager that she won't be able to enjoy? Not the hill to die on, but it certainly paints a picture of her future with her bf and his bf.", "I was trying to talk together and figure it out.

I was really just looking for insight from others before continuing the conversation.", "So why is OP an A? She tried to talk it out.", "\u201cThis is a lot of drama\u201d. I\u2019m not seeing drama.

I just want a special celebration with us for my own birthday.  If we need to do that another weekend for him to keep his tradition with his friend, I\u2019ll accept that.  And maybe they can plan a little different for next year", "NTA. How he handles this will be the crux of where this relationship is heading. He is off to a bad start by not even realizing it is going to be your birthday, and for offering to \"group you in\" at the last minute. Soooo thoughtful. \n\nIf he can't put this off for a week, as they have done before, for you then babe it ain't looking good. You aren't asking him to cancel, make it about you, or any sort of tantrum stuff. Your ask is perfectly reasonable.", "Maybe his cousin?\n\nETA quickie divorce and pulling SAME on OP?", "Sure thing! If there's anything I've learned about our relationship, it's that the leo/leo dynamic is meant to be a power couple, as long as we are compromising and trying to find a way to make each other both feel special. If we aren't infighting, we can take on the world together. If anybody can understand us or know how to make us feel great, it's another leo. HAPPY BIRTHDAY EARLY!!!", "This seems like a good plan and I hope you two figure it out and everyone is happy!\n\nETA: I just wanna add that it's totally normal to do different things on different days/weekends with different/overlapping people all to celebrate the same birthday, and a lot of it just comes down to how people's schedules work out. It'll be different every year, too.", "Idk if the slippery slope necessarily applies here. Relationship + friendship dynamics change over a long period of time. It's only been a year, and the boyfriend is still living with his roommate. Assuming the relationship continues to develop in seriousness, the dynamics will likely shift in OP's direction. My now-husband and I prioritize one another differently now than we did during our first year or 2 of dating. That's normal.", "Your birthday and his will always fall on the same weekend. If your birthday is Saturday, then his is Monday. If he wants to celebrate his birthday, the closest Saturday is your birthday. What about 6 or so years from now when your birthday is on Thursday and his is on Saturday? Does his specific day of birth trump if you want to have a party that weekend? It's unusual to be so attached to the specific day. Most people celebrate (if at all) on the nearest convenient night. But maybe that's your thing and if so then communicate that. Being mad at him for not knowing is a bit silly but doesn't make you an AH.", "But if he doesn\u2019t budge now, he won\u2019t budge ever", "There ya go. Call dibs on next year. Join his multiplayer celebration AND have your own one on one with him this year.", "This. You are in the honeymoon phase of your relationship, OP, where typically people treat each other the best and this is how he wants to treat your birthday. It will only get worse from here. If that's something you don't want to live with, best end things now. NTA", "I don\u2019t think time is related to seriousness of a relationship. One year into my relationship with my husband we\u2019d been married for 3 months. Only OP and her BF know how serious their relationship is.", "I\u2019m not mad at him.  I am trying to find a compromise with him and I think we were both just taken aback that we weren\u2019t on the same page before we started the conversation.", "Next year it won't be on a Saturday. \n\nIt seems silly but having a birthday on a day that many people are off and available to enjoy a party is kind of a rare occasion", "They don't live together yet. I'm not saying they aren't serious at all, but \"not living together\" means there are still some rungs on the ladder and room for their relationship to get more serious and behaviors to change accordingly.", "If you weren't mad, then this was kind of snotty:\n\n\"I acknowledged the tradition, but also pointed out he hadn\u2019t had a girlfriend for those five years, and hadn\u2019t been trying to throw his own party on her actual birthday.\"\n\nGenerally, using someone's relationship status like this sounds like you were ticked."]}
