And not just a little.  \n\nSo to my mind, while the OP needs to be much more respectful of her grandparents needs and requests, the grandmother is the A here.", "YTA. You are living with them and you thought they wouldn\u2019t mind a child singing at the top of her lungs while they were sleeping? You\u2019re a special kind of something. Talk about total disrespect!", "ESH. Your grandma was out of line but so were you.", "Grandma is the asshole. Sure, you could have set some conditions and said \"let's do a quiet sing-along while nanny and pop have a sleep, then we can do proper loud sing-along in the morning\" and used it as a moment to teach consideration for others. But the way grandma acted was way over the top and totally  asshole-ish. NTA", "ESH op definitely should not have let the kid do sing alongs that late if people were already in bed but the grandma shouldn\u2019t have been threatening to kick them out either. This is a case of selfishness and disrespect all around.", "NTA - It was 9:30pm on A SATURDAY. Everyone is all 6 year old should be asleep by 8:30pm. Did none of y\u2019all get to stay up on the weekend!? Good grief.\n\nGrandma overreacted, majorly. If it were a thing that happened every night? If it had been 11:30pm? But c\u2019mon y\u2019all. It wasn\u2019t a school night.", "Soft YTA. Telling your daughter she could do what she wanted, and letting her sing when your grandparents are asleep was a bad idea. Your grandma was pretty mean to yell at her little great-granddaughter that she would kick her out. Is this the first time this sort of thing has happened? Is Grandma prone to these kinds of outbursts? Changes in mood can be an early sign of dementia.", "How is is that people with children do not realize how much noise they make or how distinct their sound is?\nMy cousin let her kids play the fckn piano (full piano, not child\u2019s) in our 10 person shared air bnb at 5:30 in the morning. \n\nYTA\nApologize", "Grandma ALREADY has ear plugs and a fan to drown out the REGULAR noise. OP took that as a challenge.", "What was a 6year old doing up at 9:30 anyway? I teach 9 year olds and the well-rested ones are in bed by 8:30 at the latest. OP is not doing her daughter any favours with poor sleep routines.", "The OP was definitely inconsiderate here, but living with a six year old when you don't like a lot of noise makes about as much sense as living with a dog if you don't like fur.", "YTA When will parents learn never to say \"you can do ANYTHING you want, you can have ANYTHING you want, you can wear ANYTHING you want\", it is just really bad parenting.", "At the end the of the post OP asks if she was an ah for letting her kid sing karaoke, so was there a mic involved too? Such an AH.", "here\u2019s the thing. if i was in my mid-60s and i let my 17 year old granddaughter and her newborn live with me for six years and they haven\u2019t moved out yet, i\u2019d be a little irritable too. why you would keep your daughter in this situation is beyond me. OP, YTA and so is your grandma.", "The last she had to tell me to keep it down was months ago, and that was only because my show was a little too loud.\n\nAs I said, I haven't been a troublemaker for years.", "Also, don't tell your kid she can do \"anything\" she wants.", "Around 9:30.", ">I think your grandparents are overreacting significantly but it sounds like you're paying for some past indiscretions there.\n\nWell yeah it sounds like things were building up.", "I agree... but I also know I'm a bear If woken up abruptly so I would give grandma some grace", "This.", "It was 9:30 at night. In a place where you can hear everything.   It had to be pretty loud if granny with ear plugs woke up.  Singing at 9:30 is not respectful.  Wake me up with let it go when the kid should be in bed, I'd be pissed too.", "Grandma definitely overreacted, but if the people who are giving you a home for you and your child are asleep, no matter what the time is, don\u2019t encourage your kid start screaming out frozen songs. I\u2019d call the grandparents assholes as well if they woke up the 6 year old from a nap because they turned the tv up too loud", "Or they could be a sign that someone who is trying to sleep was woken up by an inconsiderate parent.", "To be fair, we have no idea what the other end (i.e. wake up time) looks like, or if this is normal or a one off.", "OP's grandparents are the only thing standing between her and being homeless with a 6 year old.  If they say by quiet, she needs to be quiet.", "Not being a troublemaker does not equal not being an annoying houseguest. You\u2019ve clearly overstayed your welcome. Time to find your own place.", "Unfortunately YTA when anyone is sleeping there shouldn't be sing along... period. You know it's hard to keep a 6 year old quiet under the best circumstances so it's just irresponsible to let her do that at 9:30. I think your grandmother was upset because this should be common sense.", "YTA. \n\nBedtime too late for your daughter. Noise too loud for your grandparents. You have years of bad priors with your grandparents even if your behavior has finally improved. I\u2019m tired of kids being ungrateful for the support their family provides and the entitlement that goes along with it.", "9:30 is pretty late for a 6 yr old to be up singing karaoke. It would be reasonable for your grandparents to expect her not to be making a lot of noise at that time even if you are paying rent and they don\u2019t have complete control over the situation, which it sounds like they do.  They are assholes for threatening you and your daughter instead of rationally having a discussion about quiet hours.\n\nESH.", "I\u2019m a Tasmanian Devil if I get woken up. I struggle getting to sleep some nights (probably 2-3x a week) so when I finally do nod off and somebody wakes me up, I lose it.", "Definitely time to go, but definitely YTA", "I feel the same way. I get annoyed when I\u2019m sleeping and my husband has the tv blasting in another room in the house. Smdh.", "It\u2019s walking on eggshells and it\u2019s miserable. Again, if it were a work day/school day? Okay, fine. But it\u2019s the weekend. Grandma needs to lighten up. Her grandchild is a child. Ffs.", "It\u2019s the fact that she yelled these things at a crying 6yo too though.", "I\u2019ve recently been working with a parent because their son was tired in class constantly. They come from a culture where late nights are the norm and the kid would often stay up late at the weekend, then have to be up for an 8:30 school start on the weekday. Once I explained that kids need a lot more sleep than adults and are more sensitive to changes in their routine, there has been a marked improvement in his behaviour and levels of tiredness in class. \n\nIf she\u2019s up singing songs at 9:30, she\u2019s not getting to bed till at least 10, meaning she should be allowed to sleep till 8. If this is a rare situation for a special occasion, it would be ok. But \u201cmy kid wants to sing karaoke\u201d isn\u2019t really a special occasion, is it?", "Also it\u2019s been 6 years, with how quickly the grandma went to kicking them out I think they\u2019ve overstayed their welcome. You need to move out op YTA", "Haha fair, still, an overreaction is an overreaction and I get people go to bed at different times but it's 9:30, not 2 in the morning. Still, OP wins the AH stakes in this one.", "Her grandchild is 23 and show be more courteous and they're probably tired of living with a 6 year old.", "You\u2019re nearly as dramatic as the grandma, they\u2019re clearly not \u2018waking on egg shells\u2019 if they were able to listen to the music and sing for at least some time before the kid became so loud that they woke up someone with earplugs in, behind a closed door and with a heavy fan blowing. \n\nOP was being a reactive parent and not thinking ahead, I only have nieces and nephews (no actual children) and I even know if I\u2019m playing that song for them then they\u2019re gonna be screaming \u2018Let it go\u2019 like someone\u2019s pulling their hair.", "School starts at different times all around bro so let\u2019s say they need 10 hours like you said sleep at 10-8 school starts at 9-10", "If the house is as small as it sounds, having 3.5 people crammed on top of each other likely isn\u2019t a great time. Especially as the grandparents are obviously old. My grandpa *hated* his only great grandson while he was alive because he didn\u2019t listen to what any adults told him. Like \"don\u2019t run in the house. Don\u2019t stomp around. No screaming in the house.\" His mom (my cousin) was a young mother too and let him do whatever. And my grandpa was the nicest man I\u2019ve ever known, so what does that tell you. \n\nAnd like you said, 9:30 is late for a 6 year old. My 10 year old niece is winding down at 8:30 and lights out at 9. \n\nIf you can\u2019t respect the people who put a roof over your head, you got issues. Sure, the grandma overreacted. But the mom is 97% at fault here. She lit the match that blew up the dynamite.", "All I\u2019m saying is my parents are 75 and 76 and it\u2019s after 10pm and I guarantee they\u2019re both up. 9:30am is so early to be asleep in bed. I just cannot fathom where it\u2019s even normal for people to be sleeping at 9:30 at night. Maybe I just come from a family of night owls but it seems ridiculous to asleep at that time unless you\u2019re seriously ill.\n\nIt\u2019s like some Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Grandpa Joe and Grandma Josephine and Grandpa George and Grandma Georgina type thing to me.", "Yep, no disagreement from me, just slight variations in the level of AH to go around. No doubt OP biggest AH in the story", "My brother's 28 and he's in bed by 9 pm even though he doesn't work till 8 am. Whenever someone wants to sleep in their own home where they pay all the bills they can regardless of time."]}
