That's fair - and expecting an immediate forget is not really sane.  What she said makes her a bit of an AH.

You & your daughter need to apologize to your grandmother. IMHO.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Their rules and you chose to go against them. You could have worked it out with them in advance and coordinated a time. Maybe even a time they could watch her enjoy herself.", "Sounds like it\u2019s time for you to start adulting and get your own place. Gran has had enough and wants her quiet retirement. YTA", "YTA. You don't sing when people are sleeping at night, especially in their house", "YTA. They've said before they don't like loud noises and you let your daughter sing so loudly she managed to wake them up (even if they're \"deep sleepers\" who wear earplugs and use a fan). You've broken their rule and disturbed their sleep.", "YTA, when people are in bed at 9.30pm as per tour comments, you don't start a disney sing along. it's just common decency", "YTA but I wanna know why your mom threw you out??? I bet it's because she refused to apologize after something you allowed your daughter to do..", "YTA. And so is your daughter. She should be apologizing to your grandparents not the other way around. Only an entitled and undisciplined child would do that and think it\u2019s okay. If I were your grandparents I would\u2019ve acted the same way. Shame on you for being so selfish.", "YTA. You live with them knowing the rules and you choose to ignore them. They set boundaries and you decide they aren\u2019t valid then you teach this to your daughter?!  Grow the f up. Sounds like you did this intentionally for attention.", "Why do all people with young children think they can get away with literally anything because they are with a small child? YTA.", "YTA. And you are the one who needs to apologize. It is common courtesy to not sing out loud at 9:30 pm, when other people are sleeping.", "YTA for letting her sing when they were sleeping. I can understand giving her a treat because she did her chores but the singing could have waited till the next day. \n\nNow your grandma is a total AH for her ott words. Coming out and complaining and just saying the singing is too much and you woke me up is one thing. Carrying on and on and making a huge deal about it, then bringing up the past and threatening to make you leave and the little girl crying was just too much. My heart is breaking for y\u2019all. Hope you find better circumstances.", "Has this happened before? Your grandma's words were harsh, but it sounds like she was pushed to her limits. I'd personally be pretty unhinged as well if I was woken up that way.\n\nLetting your daughter have a fun night might be thoughtful. But doing it at the cost of your grandma's rest was not. So... YTA", "\"Unfortunately, it somehow woke up my grandparents\"\n\nLOL \n\nYTA", "YTA for this situation and for mooching off your grandparents for six years and apparently not having a plan to move out.", "ESH - save the grandpa \n\nYou for obvious reason\n\nBut grandma for how she spoke to an upset, scared six year old", "You made a dumb promise and should have used the opportunity to teach about respect, boundaries and common sense. Instead of letting your daughter have normal fun singing in the day, you tried to half ass it later at night and it unsurprisingly didn\u2019t work out.\n\nYes Grandma reacted bad but I don\u2019t believe this was the first violation- if she were that bad for no reason it would be very strange to want to live with someone so evil and abusive for so long. You say you are better but maybe not improved enough. Maybe it hasn\u2019t been long enough for grandma to forgive and forget, but this is supposed to be their retirement and peaceful years. It\u2019s also harder biologically for older people to maintain REM sleep and get the needed rest. YTA", "ESH. You for letting your daughter make noise and apparently doing nothing to get a place of your own and support yourself, and your grandmother for screaming at you in front of your daughter and making a 6 year old beg her not to throw her out.", "I agree that OP was the asshole. My only caveat is that I don't love that grandma was screaming at the 6 year old that she would be thrown out. This is an adult conversation. The adult deserved to get her ass reamed out. The child was simply following her mother's direction, and she did not deserve the same treatment.", "\ud83e\udd23", "65 is not that old. And I don\u2019t know anyone in their 60s going to bed before 9. My parents are in their 60s and sleep around 10, up between 5 and 7. \n\nOP is still an AH. If anyone in the house is sleeping, it is rude to be loud no matter the time. I work nights, and usually sleep while my kid is at school. But I also work every other weekend. My kid is 5 and still knows to not be too loud when I\u2019m sleeping.", "Could be, bur honestly sometimes good parents xan have rebellious and unreasonable children. We dont know what she did to get kicked out. Op seems to like minimising things, so I wouldnt be surprised if her being \"a little wild\" actually means she was horrible to be around and thats why no one is willing to put up with her. Point is, we dont know. What we do know is that she doesnt seem to care much about other peoples needs. Letting your kid sing loudly at 9:30 while your grandparens whose house youre living in are sleeping?", "I'm betting there's a lot more to it than singing. OP pretty clearly doesn't think about how her actions affect those around her.", "Grandma sounds at the end of her patience \u2014 the OP admits to being difficult in the past \u2014 and now there is a granddaughter.  A person who is abruptly woken from sleep is not the most rationale.", "Grandma may need her rest \u2014 she is aging - and has her granddaughter and great granddaughter in her house.  They do not like the rules they can leave.  OP admits to being difficult in the past and claims to have calmed down.  Do you think this is how they planned to spend their senior years?", "As a mom I definitely know how loud my kids are and other kids. My sister lives in an apartment with her 6 yr old and he stomps loud enough to shake my ceiling. When I point it out to her she says it's not a big deal cuz the downstairs ppl have kids too. And I think it's selfish AF. Like you don't know their work hours, if they have the same off days as you, when they wanna get up(nephew is up at 5-6:30 every morning), if they have kids they wanna have sleep late or nap. If I was her neighbor I would complain everyday and make sure her lease didn't get renewed. Idk about other parents but noise tends to get to me. So I teach my kids about inside voices, being considerate of others sleeping-no jumping or stomping and we've lived in a home all bu like 6 months  of his 9 yrs, you need to stop if ppl have headaches, are napping, quiet hours(based on each home, same with rules) and that they need to b more mindful in shared situations like apartments or staying at someone else home. Just cuz I let you cuss at the game doesn't mean they will. Just cuz I let you do messy things in the house doesn't mean they will.  House loudness, apartment loudness, and outside loudness are very different levels, same with public loudness and behavior like outings and school loudness and behavior.", "Can you imagine how sleep deprived Gramma is and this is simply the last straw.\n\nOP, I know you are young but please be considerate to those housing you. Family doesn't have to house you forever and you have a young one to shelter and provide for.", "I\u2019m also side-eying the \u201cforgive and forget\u201d line OP slipped in there. You don\u2019t do AH things and then be like, well, they\u2019re more in the wrong because they didn\u2019t forgive and forget!", "I give grandma some slack. It was 9:30 pm and the tiny person should have been in bed herself and not started singing karaoke.", "yeah maybe I should change my answer to ESH. I just felt like threatening to throw a mom and 6yo out on the street was pretty extreme.", "I get it, but it's not the little kid's fault her mom is, shall we say, severely flawed?  The threat to throw her out in the cold while she sobs and begs would be so traumatizing to this child.  It seems very disproportionate. Let the grandmother berate the mom out of the small girl's presence, not threaten the little child.", "I have a pet peeve for parents who think that technology blaring is somehow okay.", "I wish the family who live above me were as mindful about their noise as you are. They stomp about all hours of the day. I know it's the cost of apartment living, but my wife and I are counting down the days until we can move out.", "Your daughter was a single mum when she was little? It's very sad!", "Literally making the life experience of her grandparents a nightmare \n\n\"oh I was such a little troublemaker \ud83d\ude1c\"", "Ugh, tell me about it! Makes public transport unbearable!", "What are you even talking about? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Perhaps, but threatening to throw a 6 yr old out late at night and scaring her to death then giving the \u201cI\u2019ll give you something to cry about\u201d is still a crap thing to do. Nobody in this family is acting like a mature rational adult.", "Love your comments. My 6yo goes to sleep at 10p...because she does sleep until 8a. School doesn't start until 9:30a. Could she go to sleep earlier/get up earlier? Sure, but I like actually spending time with my kids, she still gets 10 hours of sleep, and is on a routine."]}
