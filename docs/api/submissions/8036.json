Everyone haros on kids but the reality is that being a child is such a very small phase in your lifespan(hopefully) and a lot of adults that are failing to thrive, are shiity, inconsiderate adults were always treated as children and then woke up on their 18th bday or whatever age their parents decided they were adults, thrust upon the world without any actual guidance or experience with conducting themselves as caring, kind, thoughtful adults. Everyone complains about children's horrible behavior and most of the time it's due to multiple generations of bad, inadequate, lazy, or negligent parenting. Like how do you expect your child to b mindful of others and express themselves in a appropriate fashion, and properly articulate themselvws when you yourself act like a wild animal and they have never seen you actually do these things.

Sleep isn\u2019t one size fits all.  However , it is a must to develop a routine where your daughter has quiet activities when your grandparents are sleeping.

I think if they daughter said \u201ckaraoke\u201d, it would be a good time to say, \u201ckaraoke is a fun activity but let\u2019s save that for the daytime when grandma and grandpa are awake! We can do that tomorrow at lunchtime. Since it\u2019s bedtime for the house, how about we pick a quieter activity like reading a book or a round of go-fish?\u201d. It\u2019s an opportunity to acknowledge your daughter\u2019s request, remind them of staying respectful to others in the house, and providing some other more acceptable options for this scenario.\n\nI think an apology from the daughter and you (separately) to the grandparents would be a good start to help call grandma down, and maybe you could practice \u201cokay goodnight grandma and grandpa, now we will have quiet time until we go to sleep too\u201d so they see you\u2019re putting in the work to teach respect in that area. \n\nAlso judgment: YTA", "> There is no somehow about it. Stop lying to yourself. You know what you did was wrong, and you let your daughter do it anyway.\n\nYeah, there's no way on this earth that literally anything else was going to happen here.  I don't have kids and I've never seen a frame of Frozen but even I know that.", "Right? In high school, my bedtime was 10\n\nHow is a 1st grader up this late?", ">My only caveat is that I don't love that grandma was screaming at the 6 year old that she would be thrown out.\n\nThis is my feeling, this is definitely an ESH.", "Yeah I can definitely agree that it was wrong for grandma to say those types of things in front of grand daughter but I just feel for the grandparents. OP moved in 6 years ago when she was a \u201cwild child\u201d and got pregnant with her daughter. Grandparents have obviously supported OP and grand daughter a very long time now. Including the loud sleepless nights of baby stage, terrible 2s and so on so they are probably getting to their breaking point and snapped. Maybe grandma said that because she really does want them to move out already.", "It disgusts me how often people are okay preventing others from sleeping. You wouldn't prevent someone from getting enough food, so why are you okay preventing them from sleeping?", "Well, OP's daughter is 6 years old, so she is at least of age to be going to kindergarten, if not 1st grade.  So having a good bedtime schedule is pretty important at this point.  (I am assuming the child does attend school, but even if not, in general most 6 year olds do attend school and need to be there by 8:00 or 8:30 in my part of the country.)  When my child was that age, I began his bedtime routine around 7:00, with a bath, then into bed and I would read to him for about half an hour or until he fell asleep, whichever came first.  The usual \"asleep in bed\" would be by 8:00 p.m.  Having a sing a long before bedtime is not an especially good idea either.  It's recommended to focus on winding down, doing things that are calm and quiet.", "she still should have screamed at the parent who caused it rather than the child who is just listening to her mother", "that\u2019s OP\u2019s problem to figure out tbh. if her daughter is 6 then why can\u2019t OP work during the school day and save up money to leave", "She was. I've heard she's improved but we dont talk anymore. \n\nShe ignored him a lot in favor of her hobbies. When his doctors were concerned about his delayed speech (due to low interaction) she plunked him in front of the TV with a sign language show on repeat.", "I really hate how apartment companies get away with making NO sound insulation in their buildings. It's cruel.  Rich people shouldn't be the only ones to have actual QUIET in their homes.", "Or the \"Mom, can we go to the dollar store and you let us but everything we can find in 5 minutes\" \n\n\"No, we're not going to do that,\"\n\n\"Okay, what about you give us $20 each, and we buy whatever we want at the dollar store?\"\n\n\"That sounds a lot like a normal trip to the dollar store, tbh\"", "OP should of course figure that out. But you are saying \"it's beyond me,\" why she doesn't? You can't figure out why she doesn't give up rent free living with her grandparents?", "In that situation I don't mind bring an asshole mainly because they are first", "I\u2019m not saying that the grandma should have yelled at the 6 year old. I do think the grandma was at the end of her rope, as in there had been several things leading up to this.", "Share your thoughts re sing a long is not a good activity when trying to prepare a child for bedtime.  It would be better for a daytime activity when you are trying to help a child burn off some energy in a fun way.  Preparing for bedtime should probably start around a hour before you want them to be tucked in and going to sleep, and be calm or soothing activities.  Avoid sugary treats, give the child a warm bath, read them a bedtime story.", ">\"Okay, what about you give us $20 each, and we buy whatever we want at the dollar store?\"  \n>  \n>\"That sounds a lot like a normal trip to the dollar store, tbh\"\n\nHAAAAH.  So dang true.", "no, i get why she doesn\u2019t. i just don\u2019t know why she would want to subject herself to it for 6 straight years", "Mine is the Amazon Fire Kids or something like that. Built specifically for kids.", "I agree, that\u2019s why I sold that place and got tf out of there lol", "I am pretty sure your kid doesn't wake up the house's owners who also need to sleep.", "So was his, but it was about 6 years ago. I'm leaning towards her lying to me about it."]}
