Because a simple \"it won't happen again\" is obviously not enough for gran, likely because she's heard it all before.", "Yup YTA, and op needs to apologise to her daughter for putting her in that position.  Explain the poor decision and discuss boundaries for when that kind of activity is appropriate.   Admit fault, tell her it was OPs responsibility to decide and not daughters.", "Oh we know, that\u2019s why those of us who have common sense don\u2019t let their kids do this.", "Yeah, she literally said hold my double whip cappuccino with 9 shots of entitlement \ud83d\ude02", "Ikr, next OP gonna be posting \u201cme & my kid played AGT & woke up all the homeless people in the next-door tents and they told us to stfu, they\u2019re the AHs, right?  Woe is me grandma so mean threw us out\u201d  smh...  OP, YTA.", "Me. Once a year I give my daughter a \u201cyes\u201d day and she\u2019s allowed to ask for whatever she wants (within reason) and I have to say yes.", "The o.p. put her grandmother through hell. She was fed up and in the heat of the moment. I blame the mom.", "It\u2019s taking the easy way to look like a buddy instead of a parent - super immature of OP. The OP looks (to herself and child) as the good guy and homeowners look like the bad guys for being no fun and needing to sleep.", "It seems to be the way of things for parents now a days", "YTA. I\u2019d be pissed off if your child was singing karaoke in my house at that time of night, regardless of whether I was asleep or not. Children (and adults) need time to wind down before bed, this normally involves quiet activities such as reading not getting over excited singing your favourite Disney songs.", "And she's 6?\n\nNononono.\n\nListen, you're a young mom, but you need to know that your kiddo is a kid, and not your peer. 9:30 is *way* too late for a 6 year-old to even be *awake*, much less starting an activity \u2014 much less starting a karaoke party!\n\nIf this is how you live, I'm not surprised your grandparents lost it.\n\nYTA", "The kid being awake and on a tablet at 11 pm means she probably is a shit parent", "I live next to a family and under a young couple.\n\nThe family are a dream - music only happens between 11am and 5pm, they have weekend dance parties (I assume they're cleaning?) and the bass comes through the wall of the living room but it's adorable and totally time appropriate. If there's ever crying, it's dealt with quickly and doesn't bother us. Young kids gonna be kids.\n\nThe young couple, however, run around like a herd of elephants, have screaming matches, set the fire alarm off, etc.\n\nAnd I'm not being ageist, they're the same age as me, lol. The even younger people in the apartment below are also a dream to live above, they have a house party on a weekend about once a month and who can begrudge them that? They generally stop by 2am.\n\nApartment life, eh.", "When I was little, the husband in the apartment below us worked the night shift, so my mother agreed to keep me out of the room above their bedroom. A compromise everyone could live with it.", "Parents do get judged harshly, sometimes unfairly, but sometimes not. The bedtime is secondary, having noisy sing-alongs at 9:30 pm to the point you're disturbing even heavy sleepers who live one house over is unacceptable. There's no reason that such a loud treat couldn't be earlier in the day and not annoy everyone. I don't know if some parents lose the ability to notice noise, but judging from the number of young kids with loud tablets and no headphones in public, it must be a lot. The criticism here wasn't unwarranted.", "I mean, it's not that easy considering it sounds like they live in the middle of no where. Her mom kicked her out at 17, probably for getting pregnant. She may not have much of an education or work history at this point. Everyone saying she should just move out are not considering how terrible poverty is for a single mom. She wouldn't be able to afford her child care on her own and I'm guessing there wouldn't be any child support. No car, work, money; What is she supposed to do? Government housing assistance can have wait lists of literal years, unsure what she can really do but continue to exist in her grandparents home since the system fails people all the time.", "I can\u2019t imagine how they can possibly be okay with it. One of my kids has a fire tablet and always manages to pick games with THE MOST annoying sounds/music and the second I hear it I tell him it either needs to be muted or he needs to wear headphones. It drives me nuts.", "I think these are the same a-holes who let their dogs bark outside for hours.", "my friend's sister had her child with a blaring cell phone video during my friend's first dance at her wedding", "There were some preteens in a restaurant playing in their mobiles really loud\nIt irrated me so much as I want to have a nice meal.\n\nIt is rude when other people are around.", "I am a mother and I 1000 percent agree with you. When our 7yo wants to watch a movie on my phone and he is allowed to (most of the time we say no) but we have no headphones then he can still watch but without any sounds. Yes it sucks for him but that is something he has to live with.", "I appreciate my sleep very much as someone with insomnia and chronic pain that is made worse by lack of sleep. But I also don't just want them to respect me and my needs. Especially since sometimes my needs require them to not just b quiet at home but not at home. And no one wants to deal with I'll behaved children they didn't birth especially overnight or taking them in a public outing. Also I have a belief that I'm not raising children but mini adults. Everyone haros on kids but the reality is that being a child is such a very small phase in your lifespan(hopefully) and a lot of adults that are failing to thrive, are shiity, inconsiderate adults were always treated as children and then woke up on their 18th bday or whatever age their parents decided they were adults, thrust upon the world without any actual guidance or experience with conducting themselves as caring, kind, thoughtful adults. Everyone complains about children's horrible behavior and most of the time it's due to multiple generations of bad, inadequate, lazy, or negligent parenting. Like how do you expect your child to b mindful of others and express themselves in a appropriate fashion, and properly articulate themselvws when you yourself act like a wild animal and they have never seen you actually do these things. Kids learn by watching, not being told. So I've always explained clearly and concisely my expectations but mirrored them. I think I'm mostly doin a good job. Idk tho.", "You can't judge because you don't know their wake up time. Not everyone is like your household.", "Ultimately, not grandparents  problem.  Looking after herself and her kid are her responsibility. If she can't be at the very least a polite guest, she needs to move out.  \n\nSounds to me like she's probably taking advantage of grand parents (certainly seems grand parents think that) and someone doesn't get a pass on that just because they're a single mum.", "This. \n\nOP, Sweetie, it's obvious your grandparents love you and your daughter, that's why they are allowing you to live there. They're at an age, though, where they deserve peace and quiet all day and night. This isn't saying you or your daughter are bad, but you have, and require, more energy than your grandparents can manage.\n\nAlso, you're old enough to be taking care of yourself and your daughter. I realize it's difficult as a single parent, but nowhere near impossible. It's time to start working towards being out on your own.", "When I took a travel bus a few months ago it was surprisingly an older woman (60\u2019s??) was watching tiktok with the volume across the aisle from me (i forgot my headphones and fuck apple for getting rid of headphone jack)", "Sorry can\u2019t hear you. The video of my neighbour on this train is blaring.", "That says more about the quality of your floor/his ceiling than anything either of you were doing.", "Sleep deprivation is torture; not hyperbole, it's recognised as such by the Geneva convention.\n\nPoor kid probably struggled in school and never achieved her true potential.", "Syntax", "Syntax. The structure of the sentence does not make any sense: as a single mom, she went to bed implies that the daughter is the subject of the sentence and that she is the single mom.", "She graduated summa cum laude from college so she's doing alright", "That's actually great to hear! I'm glad it didn't affect her future."]}
