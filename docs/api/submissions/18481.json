They have overtly rejected you, and I'm sorry to say they may never change. \n\nI read something recently; you cannot force people to be kind to you, but you can choose to surround yourself with kind people. \n\nYou were right to not attend the BBQ. \n\nStory time. My best friend is 50. We are both women, and we dated long ago. Her family is like your family. Very religious and conservative, homophobic bigots. When my friend came out at age 18, her previously \"loving\" family rejected her. They invited her to functions, but they \"requested\" that she not hug her niece (implying she's a pedo on some mission to turn her niece gay). My friend's girlfriend was not invited, but came to give my friend a ride home from a holiday party. She knocked on the door and was told she's not welcome inside and to wait on the porch. All the aunts and the matriarch told my friend's mother that she must reject her sinful daughter or they would cut her off too. To her everlasting shame, she listened to her sisters and rejected her own daughter. 20 yrs later my friend reconciled with her mother, but the damage was done. Her mother was a very kind woman and she never forgave herself for not standing up to those aunts. She died from covid. I've known my friend for 18 yrs now, and part of the family says they \"love me\" and they invite me to things; both during the time I dated my now-friend, and now, even years after our break-up. BUT- it is soooooo blatantly obvious that they still believe that we are sinful and possessed by demons. They all make me sick. \n\nI'm sorry to say your family is going to hurt you many more times in the future, and I hope that your mom will stand up and do the right thing. She may love you, but she's being a coward. She needs to examine her beliefs and challenge herself to face the reality that there is nothing wrong with you, and nothing to be ashamed of, and you deserve the same treatment as everyone else in the family. They should be thrilled that you're in a loving relationship, and that you are happy. If they are incapable of treating the REAL you with decency, if they are incapable of ALLOWING you to be your authentic self, then they don't deserve your presence; and consequently they will be seeing a lot less of you in the future. \n\n\"I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation.
