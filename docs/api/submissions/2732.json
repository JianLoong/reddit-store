She's a shepherd terrier mix, kind of a wonder mutt who's a perfect 37 lbs. But she's got energy in spades so every day I take her to a popular set of baseball diamonds before work for her to play fetch and blow of steam, and she loves it!\n\nThe first time I took her to this diamond there was a group of older (In their 60s) people who all had dogs running around and I offered to do a meet and greet and be part of their group so my dog could get to play too! She's really dog and people social! They didn't even respond and just stared at me like I grew two heads. I repeated myself but they started making up weak excuses about \"she seems reactive\" when she wasn't even pulling on leash. \n\nSo I go to the diamond next to them now, and every time I do, their dogs bark at my dog through the fence when all she's doing is playing fetch with me. So normally they shout at their dogs from a distance to come back, which they don't because they're barking at my dog, and then they leave all leave.\n\nI was telling a coworker and he told me that was a butthole move but I'm not even engaging with them! This is a public space and I'm allowed to take my dog out and she really enjoys running. But AITA for refusing to not play fetch with my dog?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Especially so if I know they came from a shelter. Shelters lie their asses off about dog history and I\u2019ve seen wayyyy too many dog attacks by pits at dog parks (lived in a fancy Atlanta suburb for a long time) \n\nThe dogs that attack at parks apparently just \u201csnapped\u201d and their owners had no idea because they had always been great and the shelter said they were just big nanny dogs. My cousin lost the tip of his nose to rescue pit bull when it attacked his lab and he tried to break up the dog fight. That was my \u201cenough\u201d moment and now I don\u2019t risk it. \n\nOP is NTA because it\u2019s a public park and legally she has just as much right to use it as everyone else.", "It's baseball diamonds at a local community park", "The dogs are probably barking because they are picking up on their owners' discomfort with your dogs energy level. You were being considerate by moving to another diamond.\n\nOne city I lived in had a long standing, unsanctioned doggo holiday. Right after straw has been laid down to protect a grassy field from the snow in one of the parks, dog owners sneak out at night to hide treats and toys under the straw. I went with a friend one year, and it was a glorious sight. There had to be at least 5 dozen exuberantly happy dogs snuffling out treats, triumphantly parading about with their new toys, running for the sheer joy of running, and playing in the last warm sunlight of that year. \n\nI miss those days. \n\nNTS", "Where do I get a job where I can bring my dog to work \ud83e\udd23?
