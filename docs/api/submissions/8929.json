Over time, he\u2019s grown a sensitivity to smoke and we\u2019ve also moved alot, mainly in places that I don\u2019t smoke inside, and for example I used to smoke in his car but he doesn\u2019t like me doing that anymore. So generally his attitude towards my smoking now is a lot more judgemental/and impatient like if he has to wait for me to finish smoking before we go in somewhere he\u2019ll get bored and annoyed sometimes. And I used to get really pissed off with him cause he met me a smoker, I\u2019ve always been a smoker and have no plans of quitting any time soon and it\u2019s unfair to me that he takes issue with it now, but in reality he\u2019s not being an asshole for changing his mind or being concerned about my health or his own by not wanting to be around smoke. I would get really resentful of having to go outside or wait til stops on long drives but now I recognise that my choice of what I want to do with my body is not his and I can\u2019t be annoyed that he doesn\u2019t want to inhale harmful toxins. Like I can internally feel annoyed but it\u2019s not fair of me to actually get annoyed I have no leg to stand on. \n\nDoes that make sense? \n\nHowever to actually solve this, I\u2019m not sure the best solution, I would honestly say smoke in your room with the window open and fan like you described to make the hall better and at least then it would contain the smoke to your room, and not effect the whole flat. I assume you don\u2019t have outdoor space and maybe you\u2019re a few floors up and it would be annoying to go outside (when I stay at friends I can get annoyed abt having to do this) but if you really don\u2019t want to go outside the least you can do is make the conditions nicer for your flatmate.", "NTA. The condition of your smoking was clear from the beginning.", "As a smoker myself YTA for smoking anywhere inside.

I mean, it just seems like you're using the fact it's only you on the lease as sort of a flex and an opportunity to be an AH.  \n\nMost folks nowadays don't want the absolutely gross smell of smoke infiltrating everything in their apartment.

The smoke would travel from their unit to 3-4 surrounding units including my own and another a family. I was sensitive to cigarette smoke so my eyes would water and I'd get migraines for days after afterwards. I had to place a towel at my front door to minimize the smoke flowing into my unit and I couldn't move because I couldn't afford to at the time.
