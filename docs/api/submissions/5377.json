My mum has a beautiful wedding dress that I have always loved, and so has A. We have both always said we would love to wear it one day, and mum has always said we both could. \n\nA is single, she really wants to find someone, get married and have a family and I want that for her too, I want her to be happy and she will be an amazing mum. I know she is happy for me getting married, but she privately said to my mum how difficult she was finding it that I was getting married before her. \n\nSo I ask mum if I can wear her dress (A was there), she says yes as she had said all along I could. However I am a lot shorter than my mum and sister, I also have a bigger bust. So the dress needs to be altered to fit me. I spoke to a seamstress and asked if it could be done in a reversible way. She said the bust could be taken back in, as she will out in a panel (or something similar) but even if the hem is turned up and pinned, wearing it all day will likely damage it, she doesn\u2019t think it can be let back down. \n\nI rang mum after to check if this was ok, and she said yes. So I went ahead and told the seamstress to do it. Well clearly mum told A about it, because she rang me up screaming at me that I had ruined the dress and that she was promised it by mum, I\u2019m a horrible sister, being selfish and stealing this from her. She finished the call by telling me not to contact her and hung up, I was so shocked I didn\u2019t say anything, but have been carrying on and off the last 2 days. she\u2019s said she won\u2019t come to Christmas is I\u2019m there. \n\nI don\u2019t want to cause problems with my family. I\u2019m sorry my sister is sad about the dress, but I don\u2019t know what else I could have done, she was there when I asked about the dress and didn\u2019t say anything, it was obvious it would need to be shortened, and it\u2019s still mums dress and she gave it the green light. \n\nEveryone is pissed at me because my sister has pulled out of Christmas, my fianc\u00e9 says I did nothing wrong. Am I TA here?\n\nEdit: wow the comments are split! But this has made me realise ultimately I have f**ed up on this. I rang the seamstress to ask if she has started working in the dress yet (this all happened in the last 2 weeks) and she hasn\u2019t, so I told her to stop, don\u2019t do anything to the dress yet. I\u2019m going to ring my sister, hopefully she picks up, and let her know that nothing has happened yet and hopefully talk it through with her and apologise for not calling her when I called mum.

I do understand her being upset though. If she\u2019d gotten to wear it first, it sounds like you would have been able to wear it easily after her; but due to the alterations needed, she can\u2019t wear it after you. \n\nBut if I were the mother in this situation and both of my daughters wanted to wear the dress but allowing one to do so would require alterations that can\u2019t be undone, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d let either of them wear it.", "INFO\nWhy didnt you talk to your sister? The \u201emom said okay\u201c sounds childish. This has always been between your sister and you.", "ESH\nYour sister is being very dramatic and not offering constructive solutions. But neither are you. You should have checked with your sister (since you know she wants the dress, too), explained the situation and worked out something that works for both of you. (Maybe there's another family heirloom that can go to her? Alterations that can be done to replace the skirt that you would at least partially pay for?)\nEven if there's nothing to be done, just going ahead with what you want without even talking to her is an AH move.", "YTA.\n\nI am short and I know how altering  hems work. Wearing it for one day would do nothing to the hem, it could be let back down 100%. But you chose to cut it making it irreversible.", "NAH. I can sympathize with the sister albeit she shouldn't have been rude towards you. You knew she wanted the dress too, even if she isn't engaged at moment she might be in the future, and now you've altered it in a way it probably won't be usable for her.\n\nBut also you have an opinion of a seamstress, so I understand why you'd have gone with that. Maybe keep the dress and in the future reach out to other seamstress to get their opinion on what could be done to the dress? I would have gone with multiple seamstress opinions from the beginning tbh, just to see if there was anything else that could be done to the hem or the skirt of the dress to make it reversible.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to cause problems with my family.\"  Sure does not look like that was ANY priority when you knowingly hurt your sister.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou and your mom are AHs. And you lost the relationship to your sister over it. There is a good reason you did NOT talk to your sister before ruining rhe dress KNOWING she would not be able to use it after that; ou KNEW it woud hurt her, and she would not gree ... but you wanted it MORE Than the relationship with your sister,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Everyone is pissed at me because my sister has pulled out of Christmas,\" .. she likely has not pulle dout of christmas, but ended the relationship with you.

We have both always said we would love to wear it one day\n\nSo, you KNEW your sister wanted to wear it. But only checked with your mom about the irreversible alterations. What were you thinking? Of COURSE you should've asked your sister too. And no, the dress needing to be permanently shortened is not \"obvious.\" I'm no tailor, I have no idea what goes into adjusting wedding dresses. If you ask me they're all long af. I don't know what's reversible or not.\n\nIf I were you I would tell the seamstress to hold off if it isn't too late. You and your sister need to have a discussion about this together and patch things up. It's not fair if you're the only one who gets to wear the dress simply because you got to the altar first.", "YTA.  As a seamstress, I can tell you that the chances are low that wearing a dress with a deep (temporary) hem for a day would ruin it.  It would have been reversible.  You apparently didn't even try that option, you just chopped off the bottom irrevocably.  That's pretty selfish, since you and your sister both wanted to wear the dress.", "Could you wear the dress for the ceremony only with reversible alterations made then wear another dress for the reception? It's not uncommon for brides to switch dresses at their wedding. \n\nYTA for knowing how much the dress meant to your sister, how hard a time she's having with you getting married first and then decided to completely ignore her and not reach out to her about the dress before making alterations. The dress might be in your mom's ownership, but if you care about your sister's feelings, why wouldn't you include her in the conversation about altering the dress?", "YTA\n\nYou seem very self involved. In your position, I would halt the irreversible alterations to your mother\u2019s wedding dress until you come to an amicable agreement with your sister.", "YTA, you knew the dress was important to both you. Calling your mum was a way of avoiding a difficult conversation with your sister.", "ESH because others\u2019 feelings really weren\u2019t considered all-round. OP didn\u2019t really appreciate sister\u2019s feelings and sister isn\u2019t either. No contact is harsh, but she\u2019s really caught up in wanting to get married herself.  Your relationship is ruined because of a dress. Surely the TWO OF YOU could have come to a solution TOGETHER. Sorry. Sounds awful", "NTA. The dress currently belongs to your mother, not your sister. Your mother said the alterations are fine. There you go.\n\nYour sister is clearly in a bad place emotionally. It sounds like she's wrapped much of her self-worth up in the possibility of a man, instead if investing it on the reality of her own personal growth.\n\nIt was never just the dress. She's mad at you for having what she wants, and if it wasn't the dress it would be something else...you took her dream venue, you had the same wedding cake design she dreamed of, you named your kid something way too close to a name she's always loved, etc.\n\nBesides that, she can still wear the dress someday. It won't be exactly the same, but oh well, women come in four billion different shapes and it would always have to be changed for her in some way. It might come down to adding decoration at the bottom or something, but I'm sure someone is creative enough to make it work.\n\nHowever, it sounds like her desperation is causing personality issues that may be driving suitors away. I don't think she can expect to wear the dress until she learns to love and value herself as-is...self-love really does look wonderful on a person.", "YTA- you have big golden child vibes", "Your mom is the asshole for setting up this shitty dynamic where she made you the golden child and tells you about your sister\u2019s secrets and allows you to destroy something meant for both of you. YTA for enabling your mom\u2019s favoritism. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like your sister should just cut you all off.", "NAH. Technically. Although you knew the dress was prosmied to the both of you. That's why you asked if it could be altered in a reversible way. So it would've been the tactful thing to do to ring your sister and tell her what the seamstress said before going ahead. Or even ask another seamstress for a second opinion. I'm not too knowledgeable about sewing but I think it's possible (but a much bigger job) to undo the skirt part at the waist, pull the whole thing up and restitch. Again, I'm not too sure and surely the pattern/style could not make this possible for some dresses, but I would've still asked a few more seamstresses to be sure. Whatever the case is, your sister could've had a chance to either give her blessing in advance if you talked to her, or tell her in time that she's not okay with this. It might've been obvious to you that the dress needed to be altered permanently, but if might not have been for her.\nI do feel that she is quite distasteful for her reaction though. She's not even engaged,  and the dress was given to you. For you to wear it, it needs to be altered. That's not your fault. And she could've said something when you were given the dress, along the lines of \"please do everything you can to preserve it in a way that I can wear it too later\" . And holding a grudge about it seems childish. As beautiful it might be and as important it might be for the both of you, in the end it's just a dress.\nYour mom also could've though about this before handing the dress to you, and knowing she promised it to the both of you, could've had a discussion with you two about how to make sure you both can enjoy it.\n\nIn general all I see here is something that was supposed to bring you three closer and be a nice family thing, and instead it turned into this bitter, unpleasant mess. I don't think I'd even want to wear that dress now.", "ESH, but mostly you and your mom.\n\nJust because your mom said you could do it doesn't make it right.   You could have shopped around and checked a few other seamstresses/tailors to see if they could suggest a way to alter the dress in a reversible way.  And you could have talked to your sister first too.   If she had just assumed she could use the dress it would be one thing, but you said your mom had actually promised it to  her as well--that makes her expectation reasonable.\n\nAnd your mom promised the dress to both of you, then agreed to allow you to change it in a way to make it unusable to your sister.  It's not unreasonable to expect that her promise would include a good faith effort to make sure it is usable for both of you, which she clearly failed to do.", "INFO: did you talk to your sister before the seamstress made the cut? you said you talked to your mom, but did you also clear it with your sister since you were both promised it?", "NTA\n\nIt's obvious that you'll have to alter the dress unless you and your mother have the exact same body. You mum said it was ok to alter. \nBy not allowing you to alter it your sister is saying she has priority over you. She's doing the same to you as she perceives you are doing to her.\n\nUnfortunately for her your wedding has come first and you need the dress to fit, and your mother has agreed. Your sister will just have to make do. Her insecurity about her younger sister getting married first seems to be exacerbating the issue. But that's her problem, not yours.", "NAH - I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole for wearing your Mom\u2019s dress but I understand why your sister is upset and I think this likely could have been avoided if you handled it with some tact.  \n\nBased on your telling, everyone thought that alterations could likely be reversed and when you realized they couldn\u2019t you only spoke with your Mom about it.  Your sister is then told that her dream dress she\u2019s wanted to wear her entire life has now been irrevocably altered and tough luck because you happened to get married first.  I just think it would have been nice to give her the heads up before the alterations were made and it may have softened her reaction.", "I\u2019m stuck between NAH and ESH\n\nyou say your mom told you both you could wear it, how would you feel if your sister got married before you and altered the dress in a way that meant you would never be able to wear it?\n\nOf course she\u2019s upset. Wearing your moms dress is clearly important to both of you but you are going to be the only one able to actually wear it just because you got lucky and are getting married before her. It\u2019s not exactly fair. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t wear it, but I\u2019d be devastated if my mom promised me I could wear her dress and one of my sisters altered it so much that I couldn\u2019t. So I have a hard time calling her TA for being upset and angry about the fact that something your mom promised her is no longer happening just because she hasn\u2019t found a partner yet", "Nta \n\nIn the same way a panel can be put back in, a panel can be added to lengthen again. \n\nIt might not be perfect, but that\u2019s the way the cookie crumbles\n\nI think this is more about your sister feeling that she\u2019s not following the life pathway she wanted.", "NTA. \n\nAsk to have the bottom length saved so that it can be reattached, in hopes that it's not noticeable when reattached. \n\nIt sounds like your sister is feeling an internal clock of her own design, which is unfortunately a \"normal\" feeling in women. \n\nI hope she works through her emotions and I'm sorry for the rift that was caused.", "YTA", "YTA. 1. You didn't talk to your sister. You know you should have 2. You didn't talk to another seamstress/tailor, you know you should have 3. There was no guarantee the dress would be ruined w/ the turned up hem, the was a chance it would have been ok or only slightly damaged. You didn't go w/ that option. Why? Why make it permanent if there was even the slightest chance the other option would work?\n\nThese 3 things indicate there is more going on here and makes me think this is a missing reasons post. \n\nYou are really adamant about your sister being jealous of you getting married first. How is that actually relevant to what you did? Your emphasis on your sister's jealousy makes me believe this is FAR more about your sense of entitlement and your dismissal of your sister's rational feelings of anger. You are trying really hard to lead people to conclude  \"She's just jealous b/c she doesn't have a man. She's so desperate\" along w/ \"I deserve to do what I want b/ c she can't even get a man\". To me these are pretty unsophisticated tells. \n\nFYI - your fiance's opinion is irrelevant. I'm sure he doesn't understand the depth of hurt you sister is feeling and I'm also sure he fell for your \"She's just jealous\" BS.", "NTA she can always have the skirt altered and wear it at a tea length. Maybe if she had a wedding planned I'd feel different but she may never wear the thing", "NTA. You asked your Mum first and got the OK.", "NTA. You tried to make it so it can be reversed, which is above and beyond. It's not your fault, or even your sisters, that you're getting married first. While your sister can have her feelings, taking it out on you and then being manipulative is unfair. If anything your sister should be mad at your mom. While it's nice that she offered the dress to both of you, your mom had to realize that alterations had  to be made. However, this does not mean your sister still can't wear the dress, perhaps it can be altered again to be a knee length dress, or even T-length. I understand that it's traditional to wear a floor length gown for a wedding, but there are other options. \n\nIf your sister doesn't want to come to Christmas, that's on her and frankly, your mom needs to have a conversation with her about this more so than you do.", "NTA\n\nAnyone who's angry with you because of your sister's choice is in the wrong.   You asked your mother, you asked your seamstress to make reversible changes, and to the best of her ability to do so, she did.   The fact that your sister is being a drama queen is not your fault.", "NTA You are different sizes, so it need to be altered. I would imagine it can be altered again when it is your sister's turn. Perhaps a new bottom is added and you could help with the cost? To me it really sounds like she is upset you are getting married first and she is taking it out on this issue.", "NTA. Gotta say tho, if my whole fam was taking sister\u2019s side, I personally wouldn\u2019t go to Christmas.", "NTA - your not going to prevent yourself from altering a dress so that you can wear it in the eventuality that your sister finds a mate and get's married. That's absolutely ridiculous! There are ways to have the dress altered back or she can simply find a new one.\n\nEither way, it is your day and your doing the bare minimal alterations to fit your body type. If you were to have let's say completely altered and changed the dress (such as in the movie 21 dresses) I would completely understand the sister's frustration. However even then, your mom gave you permission and it's your day.\n\nI think the real issue here is the fact her sister is getting married before her and that she feels she is lacking in life, or is a tad envious or jealous. It happens but it's nothing to ruin a family relationship over.", "NTA, the dress belongs to your mom and she cleared it. Your sister knew you were gonna wear it and knows your size difference, what did she think you would do? They can likely re alter the dress if A ever wears it.

I don\u2019t see why op should go without her dream dress just because her older sister has not been lucky enough to find a man to marry her.

And you will have to live with that decision for the rest of your life. Again, NTA, you did nothing wrong. But if it upsets your sister this much, is that dress really worth the trouble?

The ideal scenario here would have been, if it was determined, that any needed alternations would be irreversible and keep one sister or the other from wearing it, they should have agreed to not wear the dress or figure out a new way to incorporate it into their own respective dresses.", "The hem alterations are NOT reversible.

But you also seem all shocked pikachu face that she would be hurt that you made permanent alterations without talking to her.  Saying that she knew you were going to wear the dress is disingenuous.  That does not mean that she knew that you were going to make permanent alterations that would make it hard if not impossible for her to wear the dress too.

OP is entitled to do what she wants with her mom's permission with the dress. What OP is not entitled to by doing all that, is a relationship with her sister. So OP being all upset that her sister is mad at her, won't talk to her anymore and won't attend Christmas or OPs wedding, is OP feeling entitled to a relationship with her sister despite proving to OPs sister she doesnt value the sisters wants and feelings. \n\nIf the answer is yes, then it is OPs responsibility to hold value in her sister's feelings and wants. To find a compromise so that everyone can be happy and feel valued and special. \n\nNow regarding the whole \"my sister was there when I first asked mom, she had the opportunity to speak up then\" part. OPs sister knows that OP knows how much the dress matters to OPs sister too. Part of valuing a relationship with someone is valuing their feelings enough to directly include them in the conversation. Most people will not speak up in those situations because they aren't being asked and they know they don't have any entitlement to an opinion. In other words, her sister knew she wasn't entitled to an opinion on whether OP could wear the dress or not, so she didn't say anything. That doesn't mean she didn't want to. It means she thought her sister, OP, cared enough that OP might ask her directly.", "Why ask? \n\nBecause whether or not the dress belongs to their mother and was given to OP, she knows that sister also wanted to wear it and their mother promised it to her as well.

Kinda. \n\nThat\u2019s a fair thing to do when, as a parent, you promise something to both of your children without realizing that allowing one of them to wear it will prevent the other from wearing it.

No. But it does negate any feelings of jealousy and competition that have been stoked between your children, which is something you should try to do as a parent. \n\nAlso, super unkind and gross to say \u201cyour reaction to something that hurt you is why no one will love you\u201d.", "I'm impressed more than anything.", "They are family, it is never too late.", "[deleted]", "IT is, wen OP's siter choses to have it that way.", "Sister is just reacting to a situation that is difficult for her.

While I am in no way skilled enough to alter a wedding dress as a sewer none of this makes sense to me. Adjusting the bust is way more likely to permanently ruin the dress. \n\nAlso either she needs to cut fabric to hem the dress or she doesn't. I can't imagine how wearing the dress for a day would destroy the hem. The only way you would really permanently destroy something is by cutting it. Maybe depending on the fabric the stitches of the hem would make holes that would still be visible after it is undone. But again that would permanently alter it through tailoring, not by wear.\n\nGoing back to the bust it is way easier to make things smaller than bigger. Is it possible she wanted to make the panel from fabric from the skirt? Because even if she makes a new panel to increase the bust size if the fabric is different it is going to stand out. Again even if the dress is a basic white satin the whole process of added this panel with new fabric to match is more difficult than doing a temporary hem.", "NAH.

How fragile is the dress that wearing it would damage it?

(I alter wedding gowns, make custom ones, and make historically accurate clothing) There is no way one day with a temporary hem could hurt this dress like that, unless the dress is already damaged or compromised in someway. (time isn\u2019t kind to textiles; it wouldn\u2019t have necessarily been anything anyone did, age and gravity are just heartless aholes) If it\u2019s that fragile, then NO ONE should be wearing that gown at all. If one day of wear with a temp hem will ruin it, then one day of wear in general will ruin it too. If the concern is the hem dragging the ground and ruining the fabric to the point it can\u2019t be let out again without showing off the damage too, add a ribbon band at the bottom that can be removed. If it has a train, then have the tailor/seamstress sew in an additional new piece of temporarily lining onto of the existing lining, (it doesn\u2019t need to go all the way up the skirt, just cover the part of the train that drags the ground, but if you want to be really safe, go up a little further.) Sew it into the lining layer only, not the fabric that everyone sees or you\u2019ll have weird thread lines on the dress. This temporary lining piece will protect the upturned hem and train from fraying/damaging the fabric and from staining, Problem solved! After the wedding, send the dress back to the tailor, have them remove the stitches and the temp lining, then either have them steam/press it or send it to a dry cleaner and have them do it. If your seamstress is good, no one will ever be able to tell it was hemmed and then let down at all. \nNo matter what you do, I highly recommend you go to a different seamstress/tailor, yours either doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about, becuase if they did they would know that there are soo many ways to make this work. Or, they know it\u2019s doable, know it\u2019s going to take a little extra work/time and little more thinking, and they just don\u2019t want to have to do it, but also don\u2019t want to lose your business. Or they\u2019re worried that if they tell you it can be done but it\u2019ll cost more, that you\u2019ll walk away and they\u2019ll lose your business. \nThis is absolutely doable, just requires a little more work and potentially a little creativity, but it IS doable! It will cost a little more, because it will take more work to do. Please, go get a second and even a third opinion before you let ANYONE go near your moms gown with scissors or a seam ripper.

I also think you should have called your sis once you learned that the hem would be destroyed after pinning it up. \n\nQuestion: can\u2019t you commission to have the dress made for you as new? I understand that means more money, it is not the same sentiment ( your mom wore this dress and not the \u201cnew one\u201d) and some materials cannot be exactly replicated (like lace). But if the dress is not too unique, maybe you could have it copied and altered to your body?\n\nEta: I am a sewaholic and I don\u2019t understand how hemming the dress would ruin it. Maybe try consulting with another seamstress, too? If the hem is done correctly, you will not be dragging the dress on the floor, thus the material should not tear/get frizzy.", "This is an excellent suggestion. Basically, OP, find a compromise that ideally involves you wearing the dress AND your sister likely being able to wear it later. Maybe that is how it is altered? Maybe that is you only wearing it for a short time? (FYI wearing multiple different dresses is now becoming fashionable). Or something else?

Just because someone wants to get married does not mean they put their self worth into being able to find a man. You dont know what op's sister thoughts are. I had a hard time when my sister got married first because of the fact her being married meant she got to have the possibility of a family. I've always wanted to be a mom, but I didn't want to raise a kid on my own. It puts kid's at risk statistically for a lot of different issues. I never told her that though. I love my sister and wanted her to be happy. If this situation had happened to me with the dress, it would have made me take a look at our relationship. I would have cut her off too emotionally until I could calm down so as not to ruin her wedding. It's ok to have your feelings hurt over something you've always expected being taken away. The sister is not the a hole. Op isn't really either though. The mom is for not telling op to try for a second opinion. I wouldn't go to  Christmas where my mom was for sure. \nIt doesn't say she doesn't feel self love either. The reason I've not been able to find anyone is because I lived in a small town.

It's ok for both of them for have their feelings, but this dress could cause irreversible damage to their relationship. I'm the older sibling that has not married while my younger sister has. I knew better than to tell my mom I was sad about her getting married first. Not that I wasn't happy for her, it just made me realize I might not get that chance. I still happily helped with the wedding. She was a beautiful bride! Unfortunately, she ended up divorced and feels like her life is stalled. My life has changed to though. I have a beautiful little girl now with my boyfriend. I do my best to make her feel like life isn't stalled. I think op and her sister should put each other first and neither wear the dress!", "I thought of tea length after I left my comment. That\u2019s a great idea if the sister is into it", "I wore a tea length dress to my wedding, it was great! Plus, my shoes were super cute and needed to be shown off!", "I was looking for this. Since it is a ballgown style, that height difference actually might be helped with a hoop, petticoats, and tall heels. Check into renting some good structured undergarments that give the skirt support, and honestly, it may be perfect without much hemming needed.", "Agreed.  Many options, including a temporary deep hem (leaving all the length), or taking the dress up from the waist (leaving the excess so it can be lengthened later), or ruching the bottom to shorten the length which could be removed later.", "Op did not go out of their way to try and find different options. She talked to one seamstress. The breasts aren't even the issue. It's the length!", "NTA. Your sister doesn't want you to wear the dress at all. This isn't fair either. Have the dress altered in a reversable way, only wear it for the ceremony and pictures. Then switch to a different dress at the reception. That way the dress isn't worn for too long and sister can still wear it.", "Thats a good idea. Also, what would be the other options for lengthening it if it were to get hemmed and ruined? Would fabric be able to be added to it at a future date?,All possibilities should be looked at. I always loved the stories of a wedding dress being passed down generations, and each generation alters it in a way that not only is tailored to their body, but fits their personality as well. What if the seamstress can alter to fit OP and then says it would be possible to add this, or do this, in order to be long enough for sis? Even if it involved buying enough fabric now so that it can happen in the future. \n\nI think there has to be a way as to where both can wear the dress and be happy with it. OP, you, your mom, and your sister need to go and have an appointment with the seamstress. Talk about all the possibilities to make it happen so that both of you can happily wear the dress. After you get all the possibilities, then the 3 of you go and talk about which way you think works best. As long as both you and your sister are open to look at, listen to and discuss any and all possibilities,  I am sure a plan can be made that will make everyone happy. \n\nIt would be really cool to have/get large pics of each bride in the dress to display at the next wedding the dress is worn is. Who knows, this is a tradition that could continue for generations.", "\u201cFeeling sad\u201d doesn\u2019t make the sister an AH.

Whether you think cutting contact was an overreaction or not, everything else is a weird assumption.", "Yes, but \"wanting to wear\" and \"so important I'll blow up and never speak to you again, with no conversation\" are pretty far apart.\n\nMy guess is it has less to do with the dress (still an important part of it, though) and more to do with Sisters own issues around being single. \"Dress\" would have been a conversation, Sister screaming was her own inadequacies spilling out.", "You're still assuming the level of attachment was known. There are things I'd love to have from my parents, but there are levels to how important things are and if I never make anyone aware of how important something really is, and just assume everyone knows, then I'm going to go through life very disappointed. This happens in families all the time. Multiple people say they love things, but one really loved it more than anyone, and got mad when it went somewhere else. This could have been fixed with a conversation, not a tantrum.\n\nAnd yes, she had a tantrum. Adults have tantrums. Didn't matter that she was a woman, because men have tantrums. Her feelings were valid, and still are, but her response was not.", "It's a tantrum when you call, yell and cut off a bride to be, your little sister, over a dress you may or may not need one day when you aren't close to having a SO let alone get married.", "No I agree. I don\u2019t think OP is super malicious here or anything but I\u2019m wondering why the mom gave OP the ok knowing the sister wanted to wear the dress too.", "Eh I mean, mom might just not have thought it was a big deal. Idk if I'd consider wedding dress details private information that shouldn't be shared between family members.", "I tend to agree. OP doesn\u2019t sound malicious or anything to me but I do feel a tinge of favouritism.", "While I do appreciate the subtlety of your shade throwing with the accusation of projection on my part, at the end of the day OP\u2019s mom ok\u2019d the alteration, so who cares? I swear, y\u2019all get way too territorial over these wedding posts, it really isn\u2019t all that deep and doesn\u2019t warrant aggressive language lmfao", "Nope, my logic is very simple, the one who makes it unwearable for the other should not be allowed to wear it without the other agreeing.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP's sister didn't do anything wrong here, she just wants to be able to wear the dress her mom said they both could wear.  OP is the only one who would change it in a way that prevents that, she is the asshole if she forces the modifications/does it anyways.", "Could also be some missing information. Mom allowing OP to alter the dress in a way that would make it unwearable for the sister, and telling OP things the sister confided in her in confidence, makes me think there's some favoritism going on.", "Good to know your okay with being misogynistic \ud83d\udc4d\n\nStop invalidating and devaluing peoples feelings especially those you claim to care about. It will harm your relationships even if they decide to keep having one with you.", "I meant sharing that the eldest was having a hard time that OP was marrying before her.", "I mean, sure. You can say \u201cwho cares\u201d about anything. But OP and OP\u2019s sister both care, and OP knew that because they both wanted to wear the dress and have been talking about it for years and they\u2019ve both been promised the dress. \n\nFor the record, I don\u2019t feel territorial or aggressive about anything in this post. I just don\u2019t understand why anyone would argue against the common decency of checking in with someone when you\u2019re going to irrevocably change a physical item you know they cherish and they have been promised.", "Tbh I find that hard to believe, as usually hems are much easier alterations than any other modification. I just get the vibe from all of this that the sister doesn't want OP wearing it at all, but I do agree that perhaps OP could wear it for a shorter period of time. I just don't think that Op is somehow TA and her sister isn't, which is why I'd vote NAH.", "See to me it's a lot simpler: the one actually getting married should get to used it. The owner gave permission to alter. Tough cookies for the older jelous one.", "I think you're right, there could be missing information.\n\nThat's a good observation about Mom and the actions do fit, so it's a possibility.", "I think you're right, there could be missing information.\n\nThat's a good observation about Mom and the actions do fit, so it's a possibility.", "She might elope.

I dunno if I can picture what the dress is to make the opposite true. But yeah, it\u2019s an ESH for me personally. I feel for the sister though, there seems to be favoritism going on and if this is just the last straw, then her reaction may not be as assholey as it seems.", "This is where it becomes more of a moral issue, sure permission has been given but the promise that both could wear it was already made and OP should have enough character to not hurt her older sister when a compromise (reversible bust panel only) exists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you care enough about your sibling to not hurt them when theres a middle ground that gets both of you sorta what you want, thats what this is about.", "They\u2019re not but OP is the one asking the question here. They could come to a compromise that allows them to both wear the dress. It sounds like wearing the dress is important to the sister too and considering the feelings of the people you love is the right thing to do.", "It sounds like the concern is that hemmed and worn, the dress is very likely to get dirty around the bottom hem. Potentially staining the dress so when they release the hem, there will be a permanent dirt ring from OP.", "I hope this comment gets seen but there are ways to reversibly shorten the dress by taking it up from the waist seam rather than floor. It may be more labor intensive and may alter the fit somewhat but especially in a wedding dress that often has some fullness in the skirt, that can be hidden by some clever gathering.\n\nEdited to add that if there\u2019s no waist seam, an artificial waistband can be created temporarily and then let back out later", "I'm glad you're talking it over with your sister! Fire that seamstress ASAP!!!!\n\nI have altered countless dresses, specifically with extreme hems because I sew primarily for theatre, and those things are taken in, out, up, and down. Unless its a delicate fabric there is *absolutely* ways that you can temporarily hem it without damaging it unless you're planning on wearing it in a rough, neglectful manner. I say this as someone who's rigged dresses and skirts for 2 week musical runs where they aren't treated kindly at all by the wearer!", "YTA. Why didn\u2019t you shop seamstresses how could make different suggestions? Why can\u2019t you wear it for the ceremony and change?", "NTA! Wear the dress you want! Your mom gave you permission and your sister isn\u2019t even dating. When/if she does get married she could wear the dress as a T length if she is so committed to wearing that dress. Anything could happen between now and then, she may even see a dress she likes more than your moms dress. Putting your plans on hold for a hypothetical situation in the future is absurd.", "I think the sister is being ridiculous. She is concerned about a wedding dress when she has no prospects of getting married. What if she never finds the right person? I suspect she is upset not about the dress but about the fact that her life doesn\u2019t match the picture in her head of what it should look like.", "NTA your sister is behaving like a spoiled child. \nAnother option though is to hem the dress shorter than it needs to be (without cutting the fabric) and then adding on a different fabric at the bottom. That way the fabric dragging on the floor would be the fabric you added and it can eventually be removed. Original fabric will not be ruined and can be let back down for your sister\u2019s length.", "Your mom is the real asshole here for not taking responsibility and telling your sister off when she gave you the green light.", "Sorry, YTA.  The dress should be hemmed up for you, not cut off.  By cutting it off you are guaranteeing it won't work for your sister, when it could possibly still work for her by hemming.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s your mom\u2019s dress, she gave you her blessings. Your mom is TA because she\u2019s breaking a promise to your sister.", "Ok but WHY everyone here thinks OP's sister feelings are more important and valid?\nShe said BOTH loved the dress, not \"my sister loved the dress more\". Honestly, the dress belongs to mom and she have the final say. I feel the older sister is kinda jealous/sad because she wants to get married and start a family and her younger sister is doing it first. And it is sad, but life don't work as we please.\nAlso, OP tried to make the dress revertable to suit her sister too, and that's thoughtful. She's NTA and I'll probably get downvoted.", "NAH! Your mom could have thought things threw a bit better before promising it to you both, because I\u2019m sure it\u2019s obvious you\u2019re different in size so the dress would need altered. The fact she also Okayed the alterations is another thing. Why didn\u2019t your mom think about how that would affect your sister? And why isn\u2019t your sister mad at your mom for saying that it was ok in the first place! It makes me really sad to see your edit that you stopped the alterations, but I do hope you do what\u2019s best for you and make you the happiest on your special day.", "YTA.  Really poor communication between you and your sister and your mother and your sister.  You have been very inconsiderate of your sister\u2019s feelings, and while it\u2019s not ok for her to yell at you, her feelings are still valid.  You really steamrolled her.", "NAH", "NTA, your mother is the owner of the dress. The owner of the dress gave you permission to alter it.", "Is it really worth throwing your relationship away with your sister over a wedding dress? I get the dress is special to you and your mom, but it just seems silly to lose a sibling over a dress that wasn't even specifically gifted to you. \n\nIt's a joint gift or heirloom, which means neither of you have the right to destroy or alter it so the other can't use it. Frankly,  you crossed a line when you just assumed you could alter it so much your sister couldn't use it.\n\nI also get the vibe that you may be the golden child, because you and your mom seem rather dismissive and judgmental of the fact your sister is single, and your mom didn't do anything to address the situation.", "NTA you are the first one to get married and your mom told both of you that you could wear it.

I have 20 years alteration experience. You will either have to pick which one of you is going to wear it or neither will be able to.", "NTA, it's impossible for you both to wear the dress without alterations, it always has been. Either your or her wouldn't be able to wear it, since you're getting married and she's not, you should wear the dress. She may never marry, and she's being childish. \n\nIf she wants to make a problem and exclude herself that's on her", "No one is going to marry her anyway. She's obviously a hand full to go off like that. The men folk have noticed.", "OP, wear the dress for your wedding with it pinned up in a way that will hold for the ceremony, then get a different dress for the reception. Then, you both get to wear the dress. And, call your sister and apologize. Your intentions were good, but I can really see why your sister would be so hurt. NAH.", "Take the dress and turn it into a christening gown so it can be used for any children to come. This way neither daughter wears it but it stays within the family.", "The dress means a lot to OP, too, though. Why should she give up her chance to wear the dress for her sister? That's not even adding in the fact that the sister seems to be nowhere near getting married while OP has a wedding date, so it could always end up with neither of them wearing it if OP doesn't. It completely sucks, and she should have called her sister and not just her mom, but OP has just as much right to the dress and needs it altered to wear it", "This is the best solution I\u2019ve seen!!!", "OP was told folding it would ruin the dress anyway... With the info she had, NTA. But that seamstress is. Even I know you can let seams back out, and I can't sew on a button", "OP said that she did ask the seamstress if it could be done so it\u2019s reversible but the seamstress said no. She also cancelled that alteration", "Uhm pretty sure OP consulted an actual seamstress who made that recommendation. OP didn\u2019t just choose to cut off the bottom in spite of her sister \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I mean, if she promised that when they were little kids, she probably didn't know one would grow up to be much taller than the other.", "OP may have asked for the dress in front of sis but unless you're a professional seamstress you're not going to know what is and isn't reversible alteration-wise. Neither sister seemed aware at the time of the level of alterations needed. \n\nOP is having a hard time because she's human. You ever wanted something desperately and for some reason or another it didn't happen to you but to a family member first? It's human. Also she's not sh*tting on her sister's parade. Seems like she was genuinely supportive until OP did her dirty like that. \n\nOP knew full well that if the alterations were made that her sister would never be able to wear it because of the height issues. She also knew how important this was to her sister and if the roles were reversed it would be OP sulking rn. Instead of OP calling sister to notify her of the alterations and to come to some halfway point so that both of them could wear it, she went straight to her mother to cover her arse. Generally favorite children who were raised to be narcissists do this because it makes them look \"justified\". That mon just said yes despite knowing alterations would exclude on of her daughters... you can just see the favoritism oozing out of this situation.", "Also from the number of professional seamstresses chiming in to point out OPs bs about the hemline.....\n\nDo you really want to believe OP is giving us the entire truth?", "I'm an actual seamstress, and that's not what I would have told OP.", "This. Try to find a compromise. I am even wondering whether there is a possibility of adding an underskirt when taller sis wears the dress in the event the shorter hem leaves a mark. I know that depends on the style of the dress.", "I think that if they could come up with a way to make reversible alterations it would be the best, but making it to where the younger sister only wears the dress for pictures or only for the ceremony is also asking OP to basically drop her vision of her wedding day just because the sister is upset about it which isn\u2019t fair either, obviously neither of them should have to change their weddings but it\u2019s also not fair to have the OP only wear the dress for photos or the ceremony only, and have the sister get to wear it all day, you know? The idea of a reception dress isn\u2019t bad, but that\u2019s only if OP decided that she wanted to do that. I know at my wedding I wanted to wear my wedding gown as long as I could. I wanted my photos, my first dance with my husband, my father-daughter dance to be in my dress, and if that\u2019s something that OP wants then it\u2019s not right to ask her to just drop that idea for the sake of her sister who may/may not get married.", "Yeah, I'm just so baffled that it's the *hem* that's the issue. The bustle can be let out in a way that's reversible but something that can be accomplished by a child with safety pins is beyond this seamstress?", "Unfortunately that\u2019s the advice she got (I don\u2019t know shizz about being a seamstress so I have no opinion on any of that)", "When I was a little girl and my mom let out my hems if there was a line she added a tuck to disguise it.", "I also thought that if the hemming harms the dress, the sister could possibly get the bottom edged with a fresh panel of lace or something to lengthen the dress/hide a dirt line.\n\nRegardless, it's best for the discussion to involve the affected parties - not cool to just discuss with mom and not sis. Best to discuss with sis and ask seamstress what repairs would be possible to alter dress first for OP and then for sis.\n\nNAH I think because op did take the critique quickly and stop the seamstress.", "I\u2019d be curious about the bustle too. Could they add some clips or ties to the front to allow it to be bustled all the way around? Or wear it for the ceremony then switch into a reception dress. That way they could keep the length as is and just add taller shoes for the ceremony to compensate for the length.", "\"Feeling Sad\" doesn't make her an AH, but telling her sister she is a horrible person and not to contact anymore does", "Sure but if she does alter that dress and sister can\u2019t wear it and she does end up getting married one day\u2026 well if OP can live with her sister not forgiving her about that. \n\nThough at this point if OP can\u2019t get reversible alterations I think neither of them should get the dress.", "Exactly. Makes me wonder if it's a real seamstress or just a friend of OP who happens to sew.", "That would actually be a viable solution, if there was enough length and the \"dirt band\" wasn't too wide.", "That could work.  It's actually what I meant when I suggested ruching in a comment here... don't hem it, just ruch or bustle it to gather it up a few inches so it's the right length for OP, then lower it later for sister.", "I\u2019m a big sister to a little sister, we\u2019re also roommates and best friends. Sometimes our mom does bridge the gap between us when we\u2019re being obtuse about how the other one is feeling or what they\u2019re going through, because we don\u2019t want to put that on the other one.", "I agree with you. But I was replying to the statement \u201csister feeling sad about getting married first kind of makes her the asshole\u201d. I don\u2019t agree with the sisters behavior nor am I excusing it, but she\u2019s completely not an AH for having feelings about it.", "Absolutely, I think I would need to see an update about the convo between the sister and OP after she stopped the alterations to actually pick a stance. As a younger sister, I gave up a lot of things because my older sister wanted it or couldn\u2019t have it as well, I know how much resentment that can cause in a relationship. I think everyone sucks here, but the way the sister reacted just leaves a bad taste in my mouth, you know? I also think that this isn\u2019t an all or nothing situation either, there are other ways to make it to where both of them could wear the dress without having to choose one of the sisters, or neither of them. There is also no telling how their relationship was before then, like my sister and I are opposites so even if my sister wore the dress before me, or vice versa, one of us would probably like it better after the alterations anyway, or like the freedom to change it how we saw fit after the first wedding.", "Yes! That would make it wearable for both brides when sister is ready to get married and wouldn\u2019t involved permanent alterations. My niece planned her wedding in a bout 3 days so she didn\u2019t have time for alterations. Instead she wore tall shoes and the cut and fabric was flowy enough that the added length pooled around her so beautifully once heels were added.", "Why misogynistic? Men throw epic tantrums to, so it's not a gender problem but a maturity one. And I happen to have amazing relationships by the way.", "I would agree with you if A were engaged at least. As it is she's ruining OP's wedding preparations.", "The wedding dress racket is friggen insane. People just lose their absolute minds over it, and pay exorbitant fees for a garment they wear once. And then get stressed out over later on when they try to put it on and realize they've gone up about 5 sizes.\n\nMeanwhile the men just rent a tux for the evening. And if they want to wear another one to renew their vows or something, they just rent another one that's in their current size.\n\nIf I ever get married again it's gonna be a t-shirt and jeans occasion.", "The comments are making me feel insane because it\u2019s not like she completely disregarded the sister and went ahead and chopped it?

I would get a second opinion for options on the dress", "INFO: what is the height difference between you and your sister?

Kind of clever how she orchestrated it, huh?", "YTA because your sister should have been part of the convo before you pulled the trigger on alterations. Is it the perfect length for her or could she still lose an inch or so and it will still look okay? How high a heel could you afford to wear? This is why sister needs to be involved - not only to have a say but to see that you\u2019re thinking about her during this process.", "NTA. Your sister is being extremely childish. It's not her dress, it's your mom's. You are doing everything you can to accommodate someone that is ultimately just jealous she is not getting married first.", "NTA, your mom signed off on it. I don't understand why people are saying you are. I do like that you are going to try and talk to your sister. I think that's the adult thing to do.

Get married in the gown, take your pictures gingerly in the venue (church?); then put on another dress for the festivities.", "NTA\n\nI think mom is the true villain, because apparently she told you what your sister told her in confidence (NOT COOL), and approved permanently altering the dress in a way which ensured your sister wouldn't be able to use it, after promising her the dress, even after you told her the consequences.\n\nI think your sister is in a heightened emotional state that your mother isn't helping with and is actively making worse.\n\nYour sister didn't spill any of her issues or resentments on you until she heard the dress would be ruined for her and snapped. If your mom wasn't a tattle tale, you never would have known your sister was anything less than thrilled for you. Even after snapping, she stuck with being upset only about the ruined dress and broken promise, and didn't bring up anything about you getting married or any of that. Overall, she has behaved well (or well enough, given the situation).\n\nYou have been sensitive and accommodating, trying to ensure all changes were reversible and asking permission, so you have also behaved well.\n\nYour mom has been breaking confidences, stirring up shit, getting you blamed for ruining Christmas when it was a result of her decision, etc. I think she should be downgraded to arms-length involvement, and you should double-think about everything you tell her from now on, since it seems she'll make it public.", "Nta, your mom gave you permission to alter and wear her dress. This was your mom's choice as it's her dress to do with as she pleases.", "Let her have the dress. You can have another dress, a beautiful wedding, the husband, a fun reception, a fabulous honeymoon and soon a little family. Her jealousy isn\u2019t going to end just because you don\u2019t wear the dress.", "I seriously doubt the hemming is irreversible. I've been sewing all my life and my mother made wedding dresses professionally for a decade. Don't know the style, but has your seamstress brought up the idea of sewing a band around the hem to protect it from dirt? Depends on the fabric and how the stitches might mark it, but it's an option I've seen used before. I also like the idea someone else brought up of a reception dress. It sounds like there's a lot more going on here with your sister, this is not the way people generally react to this type of news if they aren't already upset. NAH, but its time to have a conversation with your sister, and possibly schedule some counseling together to figure out what's going on here. Oh, and get a second opinion from another seamstress on the dress.", "Honestly, I think the one who screwed up the most, was your mother, for promising the dress the both you, then agreeing to letting you do irreversible damage in the alterations. Not that you are not in the wrong either, you really should have involved her in the conversation too so she wasn\u2019t blindsided.\n\nTrue, She perhaps could have handled it a little better but, that dress is a family heirloom, it holds a great sentimental value. She was promised that dress for years, just as you were, and by doing alterations that can\u2019t be undone, you are taking that dream away.", "NAH honestly don\u2019t know how you go about this, someone loses if both of you can\u2019t wear it.", "NAH\u2026but see if the skirt can be unpicked from the bodice and shortened from the top- and the fabric kept attached\u2026also, the overall length could be reduced by making an Austrian blind effect. In a similar way, should your sister need additional length (because she\u2019s a smidge taller or broader than your mum, a border or underskirt could be added.\n\nI do think your sister is losing the plot in large part because you got there first- and your mother\u2019s promise didn\u2019t envisage this, so I don\u2019t think you are a major arsehole that you gave the go ahead to the seamstress on the strength of your mum\u2019s permission- especially if you are not sewing minded\n\nTLDR: all is not lost, think laterally- and sister is cross about not getting hitched first not just the dress", "Nta but I think you wearing it with it pinned up for the ceremony only, and then switching to a different dress for the reception is the best option. Then you can both still have it. Your sister is being a little extra sensitive...and seems jealous. \"I won't be coming to Christmas is a bit much\" but if you want a relationship with her then don't permanently alter the dress.", "It may not be able to be let back down but it is possible that fabric could be added at the bottom as a sort of trim. depending on the style it could be a ruffle or just a plain edge. it could be something that blends or a bit of contrast and maybe a matching. strip at the waist or something. I have a sister who is a dress designer and seamstress and she has made some amazing changes in dresses to allow people of the wrong size wear a beloved dress. she has even made a too small wedding dress larger by adding fabric at the seams and it looked like it was always intended to be that way. something could be done about this. the sister is massively over reacting. she has cut contact without giving a chance to talk it over. if one my daughters acted like that i would be thinking she doesn\u2019t deserve the dress at all. she is being spiteful because her younger sister is getting married first.", "The sister sounds like the stereotypical \u201coldest kid = entitled spoiled brat\u201d and the OP sounds like the stereotypical \u201cyoungest child = sacrifices to keep the peace after experiencing emotional manipulation.\u201d Actually a pretty common scenario in families. NTA\n\nOP I\u2019m really curious - was your mom the youngest child?", "It\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault her sister cant stick a man? How is OP the AH at all. It\u2019s not her problem\u2026.", "Why should OP prioritize a relationship her sister is ready to walk away from? The sister is TA because she's so jealous that she didn't get married first she'd ready to walk away from a relationship with OP because she's getting married and getting to wear the dress first.", "Let me check. Is your answer for OP to NOT get the dress hemmed, thus NOT wear the dress she always wanted to wear to HER WEDDING, simply because her sister wont be able to wear the dress to her own wedding, which should have happened years ago? So OP gets no dress, and sister gets dress whenever she can finally stick a man? Is that your solution?\n\nThe sister is jealous because she didnt get married beforehand and now she\u2019s making it OP\u2019s problem. Now the sister is the AH for expecting OP to wear an illfitting dress or simply not wear the dress at all just because it hurts her feelings.\n\nThis is clear NTA", "Right, wear a dress she'll trip in!", "What's the point of an heirloom dress if it's not in the pictures?", "Getting married first now means favored? OP is engaged to be married her jealous sister isn't. The sister wants the dress for herself, meaning OP would forego wearing it despite the sister not being engaged or even having a boyfriend.", "Her sister isn't engaged and doesn't have a boyfriend so we have no idea if she'll ever get married.", "Have a huge shoe to trip with? That's ridiculous", "Sister's jealousy makes her TA. She's walking away from a relationship with OP because she's getting married first and gets to wear the dress. That is not the behavior of an adult.", "No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIT would have been to have an open discussion instead of pulling a fast one.", "The sister here is definitely TA because of her jealousy; she cares more about not getting married first than she does about having a relationship with her sister.", "It's about the sister's jealousy that OP is getting married and she isn't. She expected to marry first and do what she wanted to the dress and leave it for OP to figure out after that.", "I mean, was she wrong about that? OP was going to completely wreck the dress (and mom was gonna let her do it!) and only stopped because she got yelled at \n\nNot to mention the way mom just casually dropped what sister said in private like that. \n\nI'm wondering if OP isn't a little bit of a golden child and this was just the straw that broke the camel's back", "But a) dress belongs to MOM. Why should she have to assume she has to run things by sister when it\u2019s mom\u2019s dress?  Shouldn\u2019t mom be the one making decisions? B) it\u2019s not the hemming that seamstress said is irreversible- it is hemming and then wearing it all day.", "You need to apologize for that. Right now. Or you'll get a spanking.", "YTA. You're ruining your sister's chances of having the feeling that you want. Why are you allowed to get it but she's not?", "So apparently the whole hem issue is actually caused by the \"dirt line\" that can occur when a full length dress is worn. So, if a temporary hem is put in place, when it's dropped back to the original length there's a chance the dirt line will show up if OP isn't careful and/or wears it for too many hours. Amazing how no one suggested a satin trim at the bottom edge (where is actually meets the floor) of the hem to help protect it. OP isn't an AH for being shorter than her sister, her sister isn't an AH for wanting to wear the dress some day, the mom isn't an AH for agreeing to the idea of hemming it to the shorter daughter, the seamstress is the AH however for not figuring out something so damn simple!", "NTA. Your sister isn't getting married, let alone have an SO. Who knows if/when she will get married, and if she does get married, maybe her partner won't want a wedding and whole thing. Or perhaps she will have a common law marriage. The dress might be a moot point for her, meanwhile, your wedding is in sight. Everything in the bust is reversible, so it shouldn't be a problem there. Now the hemming, couldn't the removed fabric be saved, and added back in creatively, like with beading or lace or something? Your edits make you sound very kind and caring for your sister, your sister's reaction and threatening not to come to Christmas show her in a less flattering light. Keep in mind that your sister is willing to prevent you from wearing the dress for her hypothetical dream wedding, while what you're doing won't prevent her from wearing it full stop, will just require creative alterations at the bottom.", "Is your fianc\u00e9 your sister\u2019s boss that she\u2019s had a crush on for a long time?", "Yta", "NTA. Although not being the AH is not necessarily going to make you happy. It's your mother's dress and imo it's her call, but I can understand why this would make your sister so upset. I saw your edit so I hope you can find a compromise with your sister. Maybe she could have the skirt reworked for her wedding, or if there is not a significant difference in height between you two maybe you could wear it with high heels and she could wear it with flats? I hope everything works out well for you!", "NTA. in every way. Sister is being a resentful bridezilla before she even has a groom! The whole \u201cyou can\u2019t have something because I might need it at some unspecified time in the future\u201d reeks of grandiose self importance and wallowing in self pity. Not features that will help her find her life partner. No way is OP to blame. Don\u2019t get gaslighted by this.", "Your seamstress is partially wrong. There's other ways of doing the hem that wouldn't require it to be cut. She could undo the hem completely, add a shorter lining skirt, sewing the bottom of the lining skirt to the hem of the dress to hold it up at the proper height. The lining skirt would be sewn to the waist of the dress to hold the weight of it.", "NAH but you need to find a creative bridal seamstress! There are solutions and compromises that could be made so that you both could wear it.", "YTA", "Perhaps the OP and her sister could visit several seamstresses and explaining the situation of both wanting to wear the dress in their wedding days...  then see what design options they come up with.   And I wish that the OP could post a photo of this highly desired dress.  What's so wonderful about it aside from it's sentimental value?  IMO the OP is TA is she doesn't bring her sister to her seamstress with to discuss the alterations.  Both want to wear the dress, and it shouldn't be a race to the altar in order to be the one with the best look in it.", "NTA - I mean seriously, who in their right mind wants to wear the same wedding dress as their sister? (Mothers dress or not). If anyone is an AH it\u2019s your mom for promising it to both of you. The correct response would be which ever of you gets married first can wear it. Also - are your mom and sister blind? You are 5 inches shorter than them and they don\u2019t realize alterations are going to be needed? Come on. \n\nYour sister needs to suck it up - you are getting married first and she should just be gracious towards you and move on.", "I'm not a professional seamstress but I'm wondering if the dress could be shortened higher up to preserve the original hem line?", "a) Exactly, Mom is also TA. She knows both of her daughters want to wear the dress and chose to favor one over the other instead of treating them like equals. Mom ALSO should've said \"hey let's have a discussion\" first before telling OP \"sure go ahead and chop off the hem\"\n\nb) No, the hemming is irreversible. The seamstress said that the dress could not be temporarily hemmed without damaging the dress, so the seamstress suggested PERMANENTLY hemming it. Which would be irreversible and render the dress permanently unwearable for the sister. This is what OP told the seamstress to go ahead and do, without talking to the sister.", "Depending on the style, that is an option.  If the dress has a waistline, then the skirt can be shortened at the top instead of at the hem.  Then later, it could be altered again to restore the original length.", "When my SIL married my brother, she had her own wedding dress for the ceremony and dinner. But for the dance and the rest of the evening, she'd had her mother's wedding dress altered into a cocktail dress. It was stunning and I thought it was such a good idea.", "Sister can have the dress as well. She\u2019s just not getting married", "NAH. Maybe find a reception dress though. This seems to be really important to your sister and an heirloom dress should be treated gently.", "NTA at bit clumsy if you knew that you would be sharing the dress but not inherently malicious. That's the main thing. Especially if there's a chance it won't be damaged.", "Find a person who works in a theater costume shop to alter the dress. We mKe everything long and never cut out extra so it can fit the most actors. There\u2019s a way.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister on the other hand... I don't think she's going to be needing a wedding dress.", "NAH the simple answer is get a new seamstress as this one hasn't got a clue", "This reminds me of that movie 27 Dresses. I always felt bad for the older sister because she valued her mother\u2019s dress so much and likely would\u2019ve preserved it so that her sister could\u2019ve worn it too. \n\nYTA because you\u2019ve made sure your sister can never wear that dress. I\u2019m not surprised that she doesn\u2019t want to speak with you.", "Wow. YTA", "NTA. I think - be the bigger person. Screw the dress. (before anyone bombard me, I know it's a sentimental thing but hear me out) her sister is already jealous that her lil sister has found her guy, got engaged and is getting married before her\n On top of that she gets to wear the dress first.iMO since the dresses is so much more important to her than her relationship with her sister, little sis can get a similar or completely different dress, give the moms dress to her sister, not invite her to the wedding and go NC while telling her \"since the dress is more important than me you can have it but you are out of my life\"!", "I just don't understand why she believed that bullshit, I think it's common sense that hems can be taken in and out...", "27 dresses covered this issue years ago", "And in other cases it can cause animosity between the siblings. Sister is an adult, there's no reason to play mediator when it's just something sister wanted to privately vent to her mom about.", "You did nothing wrong. You did call your mom. I kinda feel this has more to do with jealousy then a dress.", "That's nice that nothing happened to the dress!", "yta  \n\"She said wearing it all day will likely damage it\"  \n\"it was obvious it would need to be shortened, and it\u2019s still mums dress and she gave it the green light.\" this sentence here is clearly u providing justification for an act that u knew she wouldnt like  \nit is written u wanted to wear it enough that u gave the green light to permanently damage it  \nglad ur getting it sorted now though", "I really don't understand this. I wore my mother's dress. I was much taller than her. She was able to add a ruffle to the bottom so it was long enough. I think sister is projecting Her disappointment at not being the first to get married. What's going to stop her from being upset at other things as well and cause issues. \nNTA", "NAH. Difficult situation and obviously the dress is sentimental to both of you. Can you both come to an agreement where the dress is used to embellish a plain wedding dress each? That\u2019s the only way I can think of you both getting to enjoy it, as like someone else pointed out if you wear it first your sister no longer can.", "Yes, youre the asshole. What the fuck is wrong with you? That your mothers wedding dress, probably passed on from generation to generation. Boo-Hoo, you wanted to change it because you have a bigger bust. Deal with it. Changing it may end up breaking it and ruining a whole new edding dress all together.", "So why is okay for sister to claim she has the greater right to wear the dress and bar OP from doing so at her wedding? Why isn't she an asshole for that?", "I thought the same thing.", "Just depends on the relationship.", "NTA \n\n1. Screaming is a bit far\n2.

Your sister can go fuck herself", "I don\u2019t know why this is so split. Legally, you\u2019re fine. Morally, not so much. Everyone keeps assuming your sister is upset out of jealousy but not asking her opinion about permanent alterations being made to a dress you were both promised the opportunity to wear is an AH move. You knew it was important to her too and you knew the alterations they were going to do likely could not be reversed and yet you gave them the go ahead to alter it instead of trying to find another solution. You were lucky they hadn\u2019t started the work after having had the dress for two weeks already. Your mom kind of sucks too for promising you both the dress and then giving you the go ahead to ruin any chance your sister had to wear it. Oh and she sucks for telling you what your sister told her in confidence too. YTA", "It\u2019s a really unfortunate situation. NTA ultimately but if I was your sister I\u2019d tell you to go ahead. I think she\u2019s projecting her disappointment at not yet being married. Hope you sort it out. X", "Irreversibly? Try to look fot sewwer comment there wayyy far from irreversible", "What do you think mom should have done to treat them like equals though? Just say neither can wear it?
