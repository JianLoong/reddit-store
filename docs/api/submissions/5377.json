My mum has a beautiful wedding dress that I have always loved, and so has A. We have both always said we would love to wear it one day, and mum has always said we both could. \n\nA is single, she really wants to find someone, get married and have a family and I want that for her too, I want her to be happy and she will be an amazing mum. I know she is happy for me getting married, but she privately said to my mum how difficult she was finding it that I was getting married before her. \n\nSo I ask mum if I can wear her dress (A was there), she says yes as she had said all along I could. However I am a lot shorter than my mum and sister, I also have a bigger bust. So the dress needs to be altered to fit me. I spoke to a seamstress and asked if it could be done in a reversible way. She said the bust could be taken back in, as she will out in a panel (or something similar) but even if the hem is turned up and pinned, wearing it all day will likely damage it, she doesn\u2019t think it can be let back down. \n\nI rang mum after to check if this was ok, and she said yes. So I went ahead and told the seamstress to do it. Well clearly mum told A about it, because she rang me up screaming at me that I had ruined the dress and that she was promised it by mum, I\u2019m a horrible sister, being selfish and stealing this from her. She finished the call by telling me not to contact her and hung up, I was so shocked I didn\u2019t say anything, but have been carrying on and off the last 2 days. she\u2019s said she won\u2019t come to Christmas is I\u2019m there. \n\nI don\u2019t want to cause problems with my family. I\u2019m sorry my sister is sad about the dress, but I don\u2019t know what else I could have done, she was there when I asked about the dress and didn\u2019t say anything, it was obvious it would need to be shortened, and it\u2019s still mums dress and she gave it the green light. \n\nEveryone is pissed at me because my sister has pulled out of Christmas, my fianc\u00e9 says I did nothing wrong.

I do understand her being upset though. If she\u2019d gotten to wear it first, it sounds like you would have been able to wear it easily after her; but due to the alterations needed, she can\u2019t wear it after you. \n\nBut if I were the mother in this situation and both of my daughters wanted to wear the dress but allowing one to do so would require alterations that can\u2019t be undone, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d let either of them wear it.", "INFO\nWhy didnt you talk to your sister? The \u201emom said okay\u201c sounds childish. This has always been between your sister and you.", "ESH\nYour sister is being very dramatic and not offering constructive solutions. But neither are you. You should have checked with your sister (since you know she wants the dress, too), explained the situation and worked out something that works for both of you. (Maybe there's another family heirloom that can go to her? Alterations that can be done to replace the skirt that you would at least partially pay for?)\nEven if there's nothing to be done, just going ahead with what you want without even talking to her is an AH move.", "YTA.\n\nI am short and I know how altering  hems work. Wearing it for one day would do nothing to the hem, it could be let back down 100%. But you chose to cut it making it irreversible.", "NAH. I can sympathize with the sister albeit she shouldn't have been rude towards you. You knew she wanted the dress too, even if she isn't engaged at moment she might be in the future, and now you've altered it in a way it probably won't be usable for her.\n\nBut also you have an opinion of a seamstress, so I understand why you'd have gone with that. Maybe keep the dress and in the future reach out to other seamstress to get their opinion on what could be done to the dress? I would have gone with multiple seamstress opinions from the beginning tbh, just to see if there was anything else that could be done to the hem or the skirt of the dress to make it reversible.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to cause problems with my family.\"  Sure does not look like that was ANY priority when you knowingly hurt your sister.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou and your mom are AHs. And you lost the relationship to your sister over it. There is a good reason you did NOT talk to your sister before ruining rhe dress KNOWING she would not be able to use it after that; ou KNEW it woud hurt her, and she would not gree ... but you wanted it MORE Than the relationship with your sister,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Everyone is pissed at me because my sister has pulled out of Christmas,\" .. she likely has not pulle dout of christmas, but ended the relationship with you.

We have both always said we would love to wear it one day\n\nSo, you KNEW your sister wanted to wear it. But only checked with your mom about the irreversible alterations. What were you thinking? Of COURSE you should've asked your sister too. And no, the dress needing to be permanently shortened is not \"obvious.\" I'm no tailor, I have no idea what goes into adjusting wedding dresses. If you ask me they're all long af. I don't know what's reversible or not.\n\nIf I were you I would tell the seamstress to hold off if it isn't too late. You and your sister need to have a discussion about this together and patch things up. It's not fair if you're the only one who gets to wear the dress simply because you got to the altar first.", "YTA.  As a seamstress, I can tell you that the chances are low that wearing a dress with a deep (temporary) hem for a day would ruin it.  It would have been reversible.  You apparently didn't even try that option, you just chopped off the bottom irrevocably.  That's pretty selfish, since you and your sister both wanted to wear the dress.", "Could you wear the dress for the ceremony only with reversible alterations made then wear another dress for the reception? It's not uncommon for brides to switch dresses at their wedding. \n\nYTA for knowing how much the dress meant to your sister, how hard a time she's having with you getting married first and then decided to completely ignore her and not reach out to her about the dress before making alterations. The dress might be in your mom's ownership, but if you care about your sister's feelings, why wouldn't you include her in the conversation about altering the dress?", "YTA\n\nYou seem very self involved. In your position, I would halt the irreversible alterations to your mother\u2019s wedding dress until you come to an amicable agreement with your sister.", "YTA, you knew the dress was important to both you. Calling your mum was a way of avoiding a difficult conversation with your sister.", "ESH because others\u2019 feelings really weren\u2019t considered all-round. OP didn\u2019t really appreciate sister\u2019s feelings and sister isn\u2019t either. No contact is harsh, but she\u2019s really caught up in wanting to get married herself.  Your relationship is ruined because of a dress. Surely the TWO OF YOU could have come to a solution TOGETHER. Sorry. Sounds awful", "NTA. The dress currently belongs to your mother, not your sister. Your mother said the alterations are fine. There you go.\n\nYour sister is clearly in a bad place emotionally. It sounds like she's wrapped much of her self-worth up in the possibility of a man, instead if investing it on the reality of her own personal growth.\n\nIt was never just the dress. She's mad at you for having what she wants, and if it wasn't the dress it would be something else...you took her dream venue, you had the same wedding cake design she dreamed of, you named your kid something way too close to a name she's always loved, etc.\n\nBesides that, she can still wear the dress someday. It won't be exactly the same, but oh well, women come in four billion different shapes and it would always have to be changed for her in some way. It might come down to adding decoration at the bottom or something, but I'm sure someone is creative enough to make it work.\n\nHowever, it sounds like her desperation is causing personality issues that may be driving suitors away. I don't think she can expect to wear the dress until she learns to love and value herself as-is...self-love really does look wonderful on a person.", "YTA- you have big golden child vibes", "Your mom is the asshole for setting up this shitty dynamic where she made you the golden child and tells you about your sister\u2019s secrets and allows you to destroy something meant for both of you. YTA for enabling your mom\u2019s favoritism. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like your sister should just cut you all off.", "NAH. Technically. Although you knew the dress was prosmied to the both of you. That's why you asked if it could be altered in a reversible way. So it would've been the tactful thing to do to ring your sister and tell her what the seamstress said before going ahead. Or even ask another seamstress for a second opinion. I'm not too knowledgeable about sewing but I think it's possible (but a much bigger job) to undo the skirt part at the waist, pull the whole thing up and restitch. Again, I'm not too sure and surely the pattern/style could not make this possible for some dresses, but I would've still asked a few more seamstresses to be sure. Whatever the case is, your sister could've had a chance to either give her blessing in advance if you talked to her, or tell her in time that she's not okay with this. It might've been obvious to you that the dress needed to be altered permanently, but if might not have been for her.\nI do feel that she is quite distasteful for her reaction though. She's not even engaged,  and the dress was given to you. For you to wear it, it needs to be altered. That's not your fault. And she could've said something when you were given the dress, along the lines of \"please do everything you can to preserve it in a way that I can wear it too later\" . And holding a grudge about it seems childish. As beautiful it might be and as important it might be for the both of you, in the end it's just a dress.\nYour mom also could've though about this before handing the dress to you, and knowing she promised it to the both of you, could've had a discussion with you two about how to make sure you both can enjoy it.\n\nIn general all I see here is something that was supposed to bring you three closer and be a nice family thing, and instead it turned into this bitter, unpleasant mess. I don't think I'd even want to wear that dress now.", "ESH, but mostly you and your mom.\n\nJust because your mom said you could do it doesn't make it right.   You could have shopped around and checked a few other seamstresses/tailors to see if they could suggest a way to alter the dress in a reversible way.  And you could have talked to your sister first too.   If she had just assumed she could use the dress it would be one thing, but you said your mom had actually promised it to  her as well--that makes her expectation reasonable.\n\nAnd your mom promised the dress to both of you, then agreed to allow you to change it in a way to make it unusable to your sister.  It's not unreasonable to expect that her promise would include a good faith effort to make sure it is usable for both of you, which she clearly failed to do.", "INFO: did you talk to your sister before the seamstress made the cut? you said you talked to your mom, but did you also clear it with your sister since you were both promised it?", "NTA\n\nIt's obvious that you'll have to alter the dress unless you and your mother have the exact same body. You mum said it was ok to alter. \nBy not allowing you to alter it your sister is saying she has priority over you. She's doing the same to you as she perceives you are doing to her.\n\nUnfortunately for her your wedding has come first and you need the dress to fit, and your mother has agreed. Your sister will just have to make do. Her insecurity about her younger sister getting married first seems to be exacerbating the issue. But that's her problem, not yours.", "NAH - I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole for wearing your Mom\u2019s dress but I understand why your sister is upset and I think this likely could have been avoided if you handled it with some tact.  \n\nBased on your telling, everyone thought that alterations could likely be reversed and when you realized they couldn\u2019t you only spoke with your Mom about it.  Your sister is then told that her dream dress she\u2019s wanted to wear her entire life has now been irrevocably altered and tough luck because you happened to get married first.  I just think it would have been nice to give her the heads up before the alterations were made and it may have softened her reaction.", "I\u2019m stuck between NAH and ESH\n\nyou say your mom told you both you could wear it, how would you feel if your sister got married before you and altered the dress in a way that meant you would never be able to wear it?\n\nOf course she\u2019s upset. Wearing your moms dress is clearly important to both of you but you are going to be the only one able to actually wear it just because you got lucky and are getting married before her. It\u2019s not exactly fair. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t wear it, but I\u2019d be devastated if my mom promised me I could wear her dress and one of my sisters altered it so much that I couldn\u2019t. So I have a hard time calling her TA for being upset and angry about the fact that something your mom promised her is no longer happening just because she hasn\u2019t found a partner yet", "Nta \n\nIn the same way a panel can be put back in, a panel can be added to lengthen again. \n\nIt might not be perfect, but that\u2019s the way the cookie crumbles\n\nI think this is more about your sister feeling that she\u2019s not following the life pathway she wanted.", "NTA. \n\nAsk to have the bottom length saved so that it can be reattached, in hopes that it's not noticeable when reattached. \n\nIt sounds like your sister is feeling an internal clock of her own design, which is unfortunately a \"normal\" feeling in women. \n\nI hope she works through her emotions and I'm sorry for the rift that was caused.", "YTA", "YTA. 1. You didn't talk to your sister. You know you should have 2. You didn't talk to another seamstress/tailor, you know you should have 3. There was no guarantee the dress would be ruined w/ the turned up hem, the was a chance it would have been ok or only slightly damaged. You didn't go w/ that option. Why? Why make it permanent if there was even the slightest chance the other option would work?\n\nThese 3 things indicate there is more going on here and makes me think this is a missing reasons post. \n\nYou are really adamant about your sister being jealous of you getting married first. How is that actually relevant to what you did? Your emphasis on your sister's jealousy makes me believe this is FAR more about your sense of entitlement and your dismissal of your sister's rational feelings of anger. You are trying really hard to lead people to conclude  \"She's just jealous b/c she doesn't have a man. She's so desperate\" along w/ \"I deserve to do what I want b/ c she can't even get a man\". To me these are pretty unsophisticated tells. \n\nFYI - your fiance's opinion is irrelevant. I'm sure he doesn't understand the depth of hurt you sister is feeling and I'm also sure he fell for your \"She's just jealous\" BS.", "NTA she can always have the skirt altered and wear it at a tea length. Maybe if she had a wedding planned I'd feel different but she may never wear the thing", "NTA. You asked your Mum first and got the OK.", "NTA. You tried to make it so it can be reversed, which is above and beyond. It's not your fault, or even your sisters, that you're getting married first. While your sister can have her feelings, taking it out on you and then being manipulative is unfair. If anything your sister should be mad at your mom. While it's nice that she offered the dress to both of you, your mom had to realize that alterations had  to be made. However, this does not mean your sister still can't wear the dress, perhaps it can be altered again to be a knee length dress, or even T-length. I understand that it's traditional to wear a floor length gown for a wedding, but there are other options. \n\nIf your sister doesn't want to come to Christmas, that's on her and frankly, your mom needs to have a conversation with her about this more so than you do.", "NTA\n\nAnyone who's angry with you because of your sister's choice is in the wrong.   You asked your mother, you asked your seamstress to make reversible changes, and to the best of her ability to do so, she did.   The fact that your sister is being a drama queen is not your fault.", "NTA You are different sizes, so it need to be altered. I would imagine it can be altered again when it is your sister's turn. Perhaps a new bottom is added and you could help with the cost? To me it really sounds like she is upset you are getting married first and she is taking it out on this issue.", "NTA. Gotta say tho, if my whole fam was taking sister\u2019s side, I personally wouldn\u2019t go to Christmas.", "NTA - your not going to prevent yourself from altering a dress so that you can wear it in the eventuality that your sister finds a mate and get's married. That's absolutely ridiculous! There are ways to have the dress altered back or she can simply find a new one.\n\nEither way, it is your day and your doing the bare minimal alterations to fit your body type. If you were to have let's say completely altered and changed the dress (such as in the movie 21 dresses) I would completely understand the sister's frustration. However even then, your mom gave you permission and it's your day.\n\nI think the real issue here is the fact her sister is getting married before her and that she feels she is lacking in life, or is a tad envious or jealous. It happens but it's nothing to ruin a family relationship over.", "NTA, the dress belongs to your mom and she cleared it. Your sister knew you were gonna wear it and knows your size difference, what did she think you would do? They can likely re alter the dress if A ever wears it. Maybe you could offer to pay for alterations when A gets married to calm her down? \n\nIn any case congrats on your wedding!! It's so lovely that you're wearing your mom's dress, it's going to be amazing and so special!!", "NTA I don\u2019t get why people are saying YTA it\u2019s obvious that both girls wanted to wear the dress at their wedding. It just happened that op is getting married first it\u2019s the mums dress if she said it\u2019s ok it\u2019s ok. I don\u2019t see why op should go without her dream dress just because her older sister has not been lucky enough to find a man to marry her. I just ask that you try and be understanding of your sisters feelings how would you feel if it was the over way around and your older sister was the who was permanently altering the dress so she could wear it and then you wouldn\u2019t be able to.", "People still wear their mom's dresses!?!\n\nNAH", "No, NTA. I think your sister has a lot of issues she may need professional help for to get into a good head space. Your mom is the owner of the dress, she said it was ok, therefore you are good to go. Yes, it may mean that your sister will not be able to wear the dress and that sucks for her. It's up to you do decide what to do. And you will have to live with that decision for the rest of your life. Again, NTA, you did nothing wrong. But if it upsets your sister this much, is that dress really worth the trouble? Can you not have a copy made? Or tell her you will have the copy made for her when she gets married down the line? Or something? I think it may be worth thinking on how to solve this...", "NTA. Have a wonderful wedding.", "NTA yet, \n\ncall the seamstress and tell her to stop alterations. Get a 2nd opinion. And a 3rd. Show that you\u2019re trying to salvage the dress for your sister.

The dress is too short for sister now, because the bottom was chopped off instead of hemmed, so it can't be lengthened.", "IT IS irreversibele, so the dress is ruined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: this is not about the dress, but about mom and OP going behind sister's back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHis will cause family drama, and many will boycot the wedding: Sister will be the foremost to do that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNothing wrong with that.", "Sounds like OP went ahead and had it chopped off.  YTA for not looping in your sister, getting a second opinion, or doing a deep temporary hem, which would have at least offered better odds of her being able to wear it.  Maybe there was no way to avoid some issues, but it seems like you and your mom made no attempt to balance your needs and your sister\u2019s. Is her response disproportionate?  Yup.  But you also seem all shocked pikachu face that she would be hurt that you made permanent alterations without talking to her.  Saying that she knew you were going to wear the dress is disingenuous.  That does not mean that she knew that you were going to make permanent alterations that would make it hard if not impossible for her to wear the dress too.", "Let me rephrase then:\n\nDoes OP want to have a relationship with their sister? \n\nIf the answer is no, then sure, none of what the sister's feeling or wanting matters because the sister doesn't matter to OP. OP is entitled to do what she wants with her mom's permission with the dress. What OP is not entitled to by doing all that, is a relationship with her sister. So OP being all upset that her sister is mad at her, won't talk to her anymore and won't attend Christmas or OPs wedding, is OP feeling entitled to a relationship with her sister despite proving to OPs sister she doesnt value the sisters wants and feelings. \n\nIf the answer is yes, then it is OPs responsibility to hold value in her sister's feelings and wants. To find a compromise so that everyone can be happy and feel valued and special. \n\nNow regarding the whole \"my sister was there when I first asked mom, she had the opportunity to speak up then\" part. OPs sister knows that OP knows how much the dress matters to OPs sister too. Part of valuing a relationship with someone is valuing their feelings enough to directly include them in the conversation. Most people will not speak up in those situations because they aren't being asked and they know they don't have any entitlement to an opinion. In other words, her sister knew she wasn't entitled to an opinion on whether OP could wear the dress or not, so she didn't say anything. That doesn't mean she didn't want to. It means she thought her sister, OP, cared enough that OP might ask her directly.", "Why ask? \n\nBecause whether or not the dress belongs to their mother and was given to OP, she knows that sister also wanted to wear it and their mother promised it to her as well. So when she found out that it would need to be irrnversably altered and thus not likely able to be worn by her sister, the kind thing to do would have been to call her up and explain the situation to prevent this exact thing from occurring.", "Honestly? Kinda. \n\nThat\u2019s a fair thing to do when, as a parent, you promise something to both of your children without realizing that allowing one of them to wear it will prevent the other from wearing it. Is it the only option? No. But it does negate any feelings of jealousy and competition that have been stoked between your children, which is something you should try to do as a parent. \n\nAlso, super unkind and gross to say \u201cyour reaction to something that hurt you is why no one will love you\u201d.", "I'm impressed more than anything.", "They are family, it is never too late.", "She can still wear it. With further alterations. If my daughters both wanted to wear a dress, whoever married first, would wear it first. Whoever married second, would wear it second, even if that involved altering the dress to make that happen. It\u2019s still special! It\u2019s still a family heirloom item. Is it a perfect solution? No. But I fail to see how else both daughters can use it. Sure A is going to be a bit upset. But she\u2019s not getting married yet, and there is time to figure out a workaround for the dress. It\u2019s extra to cut her sister out of her life over this. A dress. Upset is fine. Going nuclear is excessive.", "IT is, wen OP's siter choses to have it that way.", "Sister is just reacting to a situation that is difficult for her. Have some compassion man. If everyone would give up that easily, it would be a sad world."]}
