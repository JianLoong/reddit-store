My mum has a beautiful wedding dress that I have always loved, and so has A. We have both always said we would love to wear it one day, and mum has always said we both could. \n\nA is single, she really wants to find someone, get married and have a family and I want that for her too, I want her to be happy and she will be an amazing mum. I know she is happy for me getting married, but she privately said to my mum how difficult she was finding it that I was getting married before her. \n\nSo I ask mum if I can wear her dress (A was there), she says yes as she had said all along I could. However I am a lot shorter than my mum and sister, I also have a bigger bust. So the dress needs to be altered to fit me. I spoke to a seamstress and asked if it could be done in a reversible way. She said the bust could be taken back in, as she will out in a panel (or something similar) but even if the hem is turned up and pinned, wearing it all day will likely damage it, she doesn\u2019t think it can be let back down. \n\nI rang mum after to check if this was ok, and she said yes. So I went ahead and told the seamstress to do it. Well clearly mum told A about it, because she rang me up screaming at me that I had ruined the dress and that she was promised it by mum, I\u2019m a horrible sister, being selfish and stealing this from her. She finished the call by telling me not to contact her and hung up, I was so shocked I didn\u2019t say anything, but have been carrying on and off the last 2 days. she\u2019s said she won\u2019t come to Christmas is I\u2019m there. \n\nI don\u2019t want to cause problems with my family. I\u2019m sorry my sister is sad about the dress, but I don\u2019t know what else I could have done, she was there when I asked about the dress and didn\u2019t say anything, it was obvious it would need to be shortened, and it\u2019s still mums dress and she gave it the green light. \n\nEveryone is pissed at me because my sister has pulled out of Christmas, my fianc\u00e9 says I did nothing wrong. Am I TA here?\n\nEdit: wow the comments are split! But this has made me realise ultimately I have f**ed up on this. I rang the seamstress to ask if she has started working in the dress yet (this all happened in the last 2 weeks) and she hasn\u2019t, so I told her to stop, don\u2019t do anything to the dress yet. I\u2019m going to ring my sister, hopefully she picks up, and let her know that nothing has happened yet and hopefully talk it through with her and apologise for not calling her when I called mum.

I do understand her being upset though. If she\u2019d gotten to wear it first, it sounds like you would have been able to wear it easily after her; but due to the alterations needed, she can\u2019t wear it after you. \n\nBut if I were the mother in this situation and both of my daughters wanted to wear the dress but allowing one to do so would require alterations that can\u2019t be undone, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d let either of them wear it.", "INFO\nWhy didnt you talk to your sister? The \u201emom said okay\u201c sounds childish. This has always been between your sister and you.", "ESH\nYour sister is being very dramatic and not offering constructive solutions. But neither are you. You should have checked with your sister (since you know she wants the dress, too), explained the situation and worked out something that works for both of you. (Maybe there's another family heirloom that can go to her? Alterations that can be done to replace the skirt that you would at least partially pay for?)\nEven if there's nothing to be done, just going ahead with what you want without even talking to her is an AH move.", "YTA.\n\nI am short and I know how altering  hems work. Wearing it for one day would do nothing to the hem, it could be let back down 100%. But you chose to cut it making it irreversible.", "NAH. I can sympathize with the sister albeit she shouldn't have been rude towards you. You knew she wanted the dress too, even if she isn't engaged at moment she might be in the future, and now you've altered it in a way it probably won't be usable for her.\n\nBut also you have an opinion of a seamstress, so I understand why you'd have gone with that. Maybe keep the dress and in the future reach out to other seamstress to get their opinion on what could be done to the dress? I would have gone with multiple seamstress opinions from the beginning tbh, just to see if there was anything else that could be done to the hem or the skirt of the dress to make it reversible.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to cause problems with my family.\"  Sure does not look like that was ANY priority when you knowingly hurt your sister.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou and your mom are AHs. And you lost the relationship to your sister over it. There is a good reason you did NOT talk to your sister before ruining rhe dress KNOWING she would not be able to use it after that; ou KNEW it woud hurt her, and she would not gree ... but you wanted it MORE Than the relationship with your sister,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Everyone is pissed at me because my sister has pulled out of Christmas,\" .. she likely has not pulle dout of christmas, but ended the relationship with you.

We have both always said we would love to wear it one day\n\nSo, you KNEW your sister wanted to wear it. But only checked with your mom about the irreversible alterations. What were you thinking? Of COURSE you should've asked your sister too. And no, the dress needing to be permanently shortened is not \"obvious.\" I'm no tailor, I have no idea what goes into adjusting wedding dresses. If you ask me they're all long af. I don't know what's reversible or not.\n\nIf I were you I would tell the seamstress to hold off if it isn't too late. You and your sister need to have a discussion about this together and patch things up. It's not fair if you're the only one who gets to wear the dress simply because you got to the altar first.", "YTA.  As a seamstress, I can tell you that the chances are low that wearing a dress with a deep (temporary) hem for a day would ruin it.  It would have been reversible.  You apparently didn't even try that option, you just chopped off the bottom irrevocably.  That's pretty selfish, since you and your sister both wanted to wear the dress.", "Could you wear the dress for the ceremony only with reversible alterations made then wear another dress for the reception? It's not uncommon for brides to switch dresses at their wedding. \n\nYTA for knowing how much the dress meant to your sister, how hard a time she's having with you getting married first and then decided to completely ignore her and not reach out to her about the dress before making alterations. The dress might be in your mom's ownership, but if you care about your sister's feelings, why wouldn't you include her in the conversation about altering the dress?", "YTA\n\nYou seem very self involved. In your position, I would halt the irreversible alterations to your mother\u2019s wedding dress until you come to an amicable agreement with your sister.", "YTA, you knew the dress was important to both you. Calling your mum was a way of avoiding a difficult conversation with your sister.", "ESH because others\u2019 feelings really weren\u2019t considered all-round. OP didn\u2019t really appreciate sister\u2019s feelings and sister isn\u2019t either. No contact is harsh, but she\u2019s really caught up in wanting to get married herself.  Your relationship is ruined because of a dress. Surely the TWO OF YOU could have come to a solution TOGETHER. Sorry. Sounds awful", "NTA. The dress currently belongs to your mother, not your sister. Your mother said the alterations are fine. There you go.\n\nYour sister is clearly in a bad place emotionally. It sounds like she's wrapped much of her self-worth up in the possibility of a man, instead if investing it on the reality of her own personal growth.\n\nIt was never just the dress. She's mad at you for having what she wants, and if it wasn't the dress it would be something else...you took her dream venue, you had the same wedding cake design she dreamed of, you named your kid something way too close to a name she's always loved, etc.\n\nBesides that, she can still wear the dress someday. It won't be exactly the same, but oh well, women come in four billion different shapes and it would always have to be changed for her in some way. It might come down to adding decoration at the bottom or something, but I'm sure someone is creative enough to make it work.\n\nHowever, it sounds like her desperation is causing personality issues that may be driving suitors away. I don't think she can expect to wear the dress until she learns to love and value herself as-is...self-love really does look wonderful on a person.", "YTA- you have big golden child vibes", "Your mom is the asshole for setting up this shitty dynamic where she made you the golden child and tells you about your sister\u2019s secrets and allows you to destroy something meant for both of you. YTA for enabling your mom\u2019s favoritism. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like your sister should just cut you all off.", "NAH. Technically. Although you knew the dress was prosmied to the both of you. That's why you asked if it could be altered in a reversible way. So it would've been the tactful thing to do to ring your sister and tell her what the seamstress said before going ahead. Or even ask another seamstress for a second opinion. I'm not too knowledgeable about sewing but I think it's possible (but a much bigger job) to undo the skirt part at the waist, pull the whole thing up and restitch. Again, I'm not too sure and surely the pattern/style could not make this possible for some dresses, but I would've still asked a few more seamstresses to be sure. Whatever the case is, your sister could've had a chance to either give her blessing in advance if you talked to her, or tell her in time that she's not okay with this. It might've been obvious to you that the dress needed to be altered permanently, but if might not have been for her.\nI do feel that she is quite distasteful for her reaction though. She's not even engaged,  and the dress was given to you. For you to wear it, it needs to be altered. That's not your fault. And she could've said something when you were given the dress, along the lines of \"please do everything you can to preserve it in a way that I can wear it too later\" . And holding a grudge about it seems childish. As beautiful it might be and as important it might be for the both of you, in the end it's just a dress.\nYour mom also could've though about this before handing the dress to you, and knowing she promised it to the both of you, could've had a discussion with you two about how to make sure you both can enjoy it.\n\nIn general all I see here is something that was supposed to bring you three closer and be a nice family thing, and instead it turned into this bitter, unpleasant mess. I don't think I'd even want to wear that dress now.", "ESH, but mostly you and your mom.\n\nJust because your mom said you could do it doesn't make it right.   You could have shopped around and checked a few other seamstresses/tailors to see if they could suggest a way to alter the dress in a reversible way.  And you could have talked to your sister first too.   If she had just assumed she could use the dress it would be one thing, but you said your mom had actually promised it to  her as well--that makes her expectation reasonable.\n\nAnd your mom promised the dress to both of you, then agreed to allow you to change it in a way to make it unusable to your sister.  It's not unreasonable to expect that her promise would include a good faith effort to make sure it is usable for both of you, which she clearly failed to do.", "INFO: did you talk to your sister before the seamstress made the cut? you said you talked to your mom, but did you also clear it with your sister since you were both promised it?", "NTA\n\nIt's obvious that you'll have to alter the dress unless you and your mother have the exact same body. You mum said it was ok to alter. \nBy not allowing you to alter it your sister is saying she has priority over you. She's doing the same to you as she perceives you are doing to her.\n\nUnfortunately for her your wedding has come first and you need the dress to fit, and your mother has agreed. Your sister will just have to make do. Her insecurity about her younger sister getting married first seems to be exacerbating the issue. But that's her problem, not yours.", "NAH - I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole for wearing your Mom\u2019s dress but I understand why your sister is upset and I think this likely could have been avoided if you handled it with some tact.  \n\nBased on your telling, everyone thought that alterations could likely be reversed and when you realized they couldn\u2019t you only spoke with your Mom about it.  Your sister is then told that her dream dress she\u2019s wanted to wear her entire life has now been irrevocably altered and tough luck because you happened to get married first.  I just think it would have been nice to give her the heads up before the alterations were made and it may have softened her reaction.", "I\u2019m stuck between NAH and ESH\n\nyou say your mom told you both you could wear it, how would you feel if your sister got married before you and altered the dress in a way that meant you would never be able to wear it?\n\nOf course she\u2019s upset. Wearing your moms dress is clearly important to both of you but you are going to be the only one able to actually wear it just because you got lucky and are getting married before her. It\u2019s not exactly fair. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t wear it, but I\u2019d be devastated if my mom promised me I could wear her dress and one of my sisters altered it so much that I couldn\u2019t. So I have a hard time calling her TA for being upset and angry about the fact that something your mom promised her is no longer happening just because she hasn\u2019t found a partner yet", "Nta \n\nIn the same way a panel can be put back in, a panel can be added to lengthen again. \n\nIt might not be perfect, but that\u2019s the way the cookie crumbles\n\nI think this is more about your sister feeling that she\u2019s not following the life pathway she wanted.", "NTA. \n\nAsk to have the bottom length saved so that it can be reattached, in hopes that it's not noticeable when reattached. \n\nIt sounds like your sister is feeling an internal clock of her own design, which is unfortunately a \"normal\" feeling in women. \n\nI hope she works through her emotions and I'm sorry for the rift that was caused.", "YTA", "YTA. 1. You didn't talk to your sister. You know you should have 2. You didn't talk to another seamstress/tailor, you know you should have 3. There was no guarantee the dress would be ruined w/ the turned up hem, the was a chance it would have been ok or only slightly damaged. You didn't go w/ that option. Why? Why make it permanent if there was even the slightest chance the other option would work?\n\nThese 3 things indicate there is more going on here and makes me think this is a missing reasons post. \n\nYou are really adamant about your sister being jealous of you getting married first. How is that actually relevant to what you did? Your emphasis on your sister's jealousy makes me believe this is FAR more about your sense of entitlement and your dismissal of your sister's rational feelings of anger. You are trying really hard to lead people to conclude  \"She's just jealous b/c she doesn't have a man. She's so desperate\" along w/ \"I deserve to do what I want b/ c she can't even get a man\". To me these are pretty unsophisticated tells. \n\nFYI - your fiance's opinion is irrelevant. I'm sure he doesn't understand the depth of hurt you sister is feeling and I'm also sure he fell for your \"She's just jealous\" BS.", "NTA she can always have the skirt altered and wear it at a tea length. Maybe if she had a wedding planned I'd feel different but she may never wear the thing", "NTA. You asked your Mum first and got the OK.", "NTA. You tried to make it so it can be reversed, which is above and beyond. It's not your fault, or even your sisters, that you're getting married first. While your sister can have her feelings, taking it out on you and then being manipulative is unfair. If anything your sister should be mad at your mom. While it's nice that she offered the dress to both of you, your mom had to realize that alterations had  to be made. However, this does not mean your sister still can't wear the dress, perhaps it can be altered again to be a knee length dress, or even T-length. I understand that it's traditional to wear a floor length gown for a wedding, but there are other options. \n\nIf your sister doesn't want to come to Christmas, that's on her and frankly, your mom needs to have a conversation with her about this more so than you do.", "NTA\n\nAnyone who's angry with you because of your sister's choice is in the wrong.   You asked your mother, you asked your seamstress to make reversible changes, and to the best of her ability to do so, she did.   The fact that your sister is being a drama queen is not your fault.", "NTA You are different sizes, so it need to be altered. I would imagine it can be altered again when it is your sister's turn. Perhaps a new bottom is added and you could help with the cost? To me it really sounds like she is upset you are getting married first and she is taking it out on this issue.", "NTA. Gotta say tho, if my whole fam was taking sister\u2019s side, I personally wouldn\u2019t go to Christmas.", "NTA - your not going to prevent yourself from altering a dress so that you can wear it in the eventuality that your sister finds a mate and get's married. That's absolutely ridiculous! There are ways to have the dress altered back or she can simply find a new one.\n\nEither way, it is your day and your doing the bare minimal alterations to fit your body type. If you were to have let's say completely altered and changed the dress (such as in the movie 21 dresses) I would completely understand the sister's frustration. However even then, your mom gave you permission and it's your day.\n\nI think the real issue here is the fact her sister is getting married before her and that she feels she is lacking in life, or is a tad envious or jealous. It happens but it's nothing to ruin a family relationship over.", "NTA, the dress belongs to your mom and she cleared it. Your sister knew you were gonna wear it and knows your size difference, what did she think you would do? They can likely re alter the dress if A ever wears it.

I don\u2019t see why op should go without her dream dress just because her older sister has not been lucky enough to find a man to marry her.

And you will have to live with that decision for the rest of your life. Again, NTA, you did nothing wrong. But if it upsets your sister this much, is that dress really worth the trouble?

The ideal scenario here would have been, if it was determined, that any needed alternations would be irreversible and keep one sister or the other from wearing it, they should have agreed to not wear the dress or figure out a new way to incorporate it into their own respective dresses.", "The hem alterations are NOT reversible.

But you also seem all shocked pikachu face that she would be hurt that you made permanent alterations without talking to her.  Saying that she knew you were going to wear the dress is disingenuous.  That does not mean that she knew that you were going to make permanent alterations that would make it hard if not impossible for her to wear the dress too.", "Let me rephrase then:\n\nDoes OP want to have a relationship with their sister? \n\nIf the answer is no, then sure, none of what the sister's feeling or wanting matters because the sister doesn't matter to OP. OP is entitled to do what she wants with her mom's permission with the dress. What OP is not entitled to by doing all that, is a relationship with her sister. So OP being all upset that her sister is mad at her, won't talk to her anymore and won't attend Christmas or OPs wedding, is OP feeling entitled to a relationship with her sister despite proving to OPs sister she doesnt value the sisters wants and feelings. \n\nIf the answer is yes, then it is OPs responsibility to hold value in her sister's feelings and wants. To find a compromise so that everyone can be happy and feel valued and special. \n\nNow regarding the whole \"my sister was there when I first asked mom, she had the opportunity to speak up then\" part. OPs sister knows that OP knows how much the dress matters to OPs sister too. Part of valuing a relationship with someone is valuing their feelings enough to directly include them in the conversation. Most people will not speak up in those situations because they aren't being asked and they know they don't have any entitlement to an opinion. In other words, her sister knew she wasn't entitled to an opinion on whether OP could wear the dress or not, so she didn't say anything. That doesn't mean she didn't want to. It means she thought her sister, OP, cared enough that OP might ask her directly.", "Why ask? \n\nBecause whether or not the dress belongs to their mother and was given to OP, she knows that sister also wanted to wear it and their mother promised it to her as well. So when she found out that it would need to be irrnversably altered and thus not likely able to be worn by her sister, the kind thing to do would have been to call her up and explain the situation to prevent this exact thing from occurring.", "Honestly? Kinda. \n\nThat\u2019s a fair thing to do when, as a parent, you promise something to both of your children without realizing that allowing one of them to wear it will prevent the other from wearing it. Is it the only option? No. But it does negate any feelings of jealousy and competition that have been stoked between your children, which is something you should try to do as a parent. \n\nAlso, super unkind and gross to say \u201cyour reaction to something that hurt you is why no one will love you\u201d.", "I'm impressed more than anything.", "They are family, it is never too late.", "[deleted]", "IT is, wen OP's siter choses to have it that way.", "Sister is just reacting to a situation that is difficult for her.

While I am in no way skilled enough to alter a wedding dress as a sewer none of this makes sense to me. Adjusting the bust is way more likely to permanently ruin the dress. \n\nAlso either she needs to cut fabric to hem the dress or she doesn't. I can't imagine how wearing the dress for a day would destroy the hem. The only way you would really permanently destroy something is by cutting it. Maybe depending on the fabric the stitches of the hem would make holes that would still be visible after it is undone. But again that would permanently alter it through tailoring, not by wear.\n\nGoing back to the bust it is way easier to make things smaller than bigger. Is it possible she wanted to make the panel from fabric from the skirt? Because even if she makes a new panel to increase the bust size if the fabric is different it is going to stand out. Again even if the dress is a basic white satin the whole process of added this panel with new fabric to match is more difficult than doing a temporary hem.", "NAH.

It will still be beautiful and sentimental, and sis gets to add her own touch picking out lace. \n\nYou wear the dress a little too long for your ceremony & photos, then change into another outfit for the reception.\n\nAdd a bigger hoop or petticoats to lift the hem from the ground for you.\n\nYou wear higher heels than you normally would and she wears shorter heels/flats when it\u2019s her turn.", "YTA\n\nRight now it sounds like a shared heirloom, so I think you can\u2019t make choices that will affect both of you without mutual approval.", "Your Mom, although the owner of the dress, isn\u2019t going to wear it again. \n\nYour sister, who you knew would wear the dress again, wasn\u2019t even consulted before the alterations were made. \n\nYTA", "YTA. you *did* ruin the dress for her, whether intentional or not, that makes you the AH.", "So, if your sister never gets married, what will become of the dress?", "Also, I'd get a second opinion.  How fragile is the dress that wearing it would damage it?  If the problem is, say, stains at the hem, can't a ribbon guard be basted on and taken off after?\n\nOr why not alter the length at the waist if the hem is to fragile?", "seamstress here! (I alter wedding gowns, make custom ones, and make historically accurate clothing) There is no way one day with a temporary hem could hurt this dress like that, unless the dress is already damaged or compromised in someway. (time isn\u2019t kind to textiles; it wouldn\u2019t have necessarily been anything anyone did, age and gravity are just heartless aholes) If it\u2019s that fragile, then NO ONE should be wearing that gown at all. If one day of wear with a temp hem will ruin it, then one day of wear in general will ruin it too. If the concern is the hem dragging the ground and ruining the fabric to the point it can\u2019t be let out again without showing off the damage too, add a ribbon band at the bottom that can be removed. If it has a train, then have the tailor/seamstress sew in an additional new piece of temporarily lining onto of the existing lining, (it doesn\u2019t need to go all the way up the skirt, just cover the part of the train that drags the ground, but if you want to be really safe, go up a little further.) Sew it into the lining layer only, not the fabric that everyone sees or you\u2019ll have weird thread lines on the dress. This temporary lining piece will protect the upturned hem and train from fraying/damaging the fabric and from staining, Problem solved! After the wedding, send the dress back to the tailor, have them remove the stitches and the temp lining, then either have them steam/press it or send it to a dry cleaner and have them do it. If your seamstress is good, no one will ever be able to tell it was hemmed and then let down at all. \nNo matter what you do, I highly recommend you go to a different seamstress/tailor, yours either doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about, becuase if they did they would know that there are soo many ways to make this work. Or, they know it\u2019s doable, know it\u2019s going to take a little extra work/time and little more thinking, and they just don\u2019t want to have to do it, but also don\u2019t want to lose your business. Or they\u2019re worried that if they tell you it can be done but it\u2019ll cost more, that you\u2019ll walk away and they\u2019ll lose your business. \nThis is absolutely doable, just requires a little more work and potentially a little creativity, but it IS doable! It will cost a little more, because it will take more work to do. Please, go get a second and even a third opinion before you let ANYONE go near your moms gown with scissors or a seam ripper.

Don\u2019t know if you are aware of that or not", "apologize to OP? this sub is for judging lmao", "She didn't know it when she wrote the post and when I commented, in her head it was a done deal. My comment was based on the post. I'm glad she was able to stop ruining the dress in time.\nYou need to stop giving orders like that.", "No problem! If you\u2019ve got any questions or need advice with this, let me know! I\u2019m more than happy to help! Make sure when you go to be measured/fitted for the alterations that you\u2019re wearing the shoes and undergarments you intend to wear the day of your wedding, it\u2019ll help with hemming and making sure everything fits just right!", "Believe it or not, 6 inches won\u2019t be hard to do this with at all! The shape of the gown will be helpful too, the biggest problem your tailor will run into is dealing with the crinoline (the stiff netting underneath) just because it\u2019s slippery and is better off done by hand.", "I agree that the situation is a problem for OP because of her sister\u2019s reaction, but OP is NTA. A situation can be perfectly fair even if it causes resentment and jealousy because that\u2019s just how life turns out sometimes. Unfortunately there is no outcome where both sisters get to wear the dress and I don\u2019t see why the sister should get priority, especially as there is no immediate prospect of her wearing it", "I did not know that. That's unfortunate.", "But her mom told her afterwards and she called her sister to tell her to not contact her. She should've tried to discuss with her sister before she freaked out. So they would've been able to come to some sort of compromise. I mean I've got a couple ideas off the top of my head that allow both of them to wear it. But instead of her being rational, she freaked, and thankfully even tho time has passed nothing has been to done to the dress yet. Her concern should've been making sure the dress was left in a condition that was wearable for her also not a hissy fit. I get being angry but as they say don't bite your nose to spite your face.", "This is how hems were kept safe in historical dress since they wore the same thing frequently. They applied some sort of braiding or trim to the bottom that could easily be removed to save the more expensive fabric and make it more easily altered with changing trends. \n\nThe same should theoretically be possible with the dress.", "No, OP edited to say that they haven't done anything yet.", "I mean if we follow your logic, then obviously the sister doesn't give a fuck about OP either because she's asking her not to use the dress by demanding that she not alter it. I don't really see how OP is TA here but her sister is not. Neither of them should wear the dress tbh.", "Reddit doesn\u2019t care about that. With any slight or familial obligation the only advice is go NC \ud83d\ude44", "Oh, I'm judging you, you can count on that.", "You should apologize for jumping to conclusions. Nothing in her original post indicated the dress was cut.", "\"Unfortunately there is no outcome where both sisters get to wear the dress! .. But there could have been anoutcome where they discussed it instead of the AH pulling a fast one and then trying to guilt the other into keeping the peace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Message OP is sending is: IKNOW, but I will still do it. So fuck off, and keep the peace.", "So all of that is fine is everyone involved agrees with the process. OP\u2019s sister clearly did not and instead of OP talking to her about it and trying to find a solution before agreeing to the changes, OP went ahead with them. It\u2019s fine if her wedding being how she wants is more important than her sisters feelings, but it\u2019s also fine if sister feels put out by that. Whether or not random people on Reddit think her response is too extreme is irrelevant, because it\u2019s already her response and how strongly she feels about the situation. \n\nMaybe she can still wear it in some drastically altered form, maybe she can\u2019t. We don\u2019t know the specifics. Regardless, I don\u2019t see how anyone can argue with the idea that the objectively kinder thing to do would be to communicate with sister before making these permanent changes.", "If you were told than an action was already being undergone that did irreversible damage to an object you cherish, would your first reaction be \u201cI know this thing is already happening, but let me reach out to my sister who didn\u2019t have the courage to tell me herself to discuss how that thing could not happen the way it\u2019s already happening and instead brainstorm something else when the seamstress already had the dress\u201d? Genuinely? You wouldn\u2019t think \u201cwow this is already happening and I don\u2019t have much choice in changing it because I wasn\u2019t asked\u201d?", "After it was decided that the alterations would happen. That's the key part. Sister was told *after* OP said to *permanently* alter the dress so it wouldn't fit the sister by being too short. \n\nThe bust is able to be taken in but the only solution to make it shorter for OP means it won't fit the sister who is taller.\n\n OP told mum \"gonna change the dress\" mum told sister, sister got hurt realized OP doesn't care if she can wear the dress still so told OP \"fuck that shit have the dress but it's clear you don't care enough to tell me that you're going to make it impossible for me to wear it as well so I am dropping the rope of the relationship\"", "No, OP edited to say the seamstress hasn\u2019t done anything yet. OP fully requested that the alterations be made and it is just lucky that the seamstress hasn\u2019t gotten around to starting it over the last 2 weeks.", "OPs sister didn't demand OP not to use the dress or not to alter it. There are compromises that no one decided to discuss together and explore whether they will work or not. \n\nI do agree with you about if neither of them can wear it without causing the other person not to be able to wear it, neither of them should. \n\nBoth people can be TA here but intentionally doing something you know would hurt the other person and doing it anyway without discussing it first does make YTA", "I hope you didn't forget to harass everyone who said Y T A.", "They don't need to apologize for not being psychic.", "You should apologize for harassing people.\n\nThe comment wasn't even cruel or offensive! \n\nBut thanks for the laugh!", "My first reaction would b omg no! I need to c if I can change her mind. Not I'm gunna scream at her and possibly convince her to do the opposite of what I want out of spite. I'm an adult. Not 12. So no, I wouldn't react like that. I would not hit someones line acting a dang on fool and then expect them to do anything that benefits me. And I didn't c it as lack of courage, it seemed like oversight. She said that their is a noticable body difference in her and her sister. So why it wasn't brought up when she asked mom for the dress is beyond me. Sister, mom, op all could've and should've said something then. Like you're way shorter than me so what are you thinking about for hems? Or what about the bust? Have you talked to seamstresses about what options you have that will still allow me to use the dress? Etc.  And her sister was hella dramatic about it.", "The original comment says that it sounds like OP had it chopped off, I was merely pointing out that that's not the case.", "It seems pretty clear that OP can't wear the dress at all without alterations. You can't squish boobs into a dress that's too small for them. My vote is NAH and I think neither of them should wear it.", "hurting her and then guilting her for ending contact is not going to cut it."]}
