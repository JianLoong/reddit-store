He's taunting you, and he's enjoying it. That's the opposite of loving behavior.\n\nI really like the author Patricia Evans - she has a list of rights in a relationship. The one that I think most applies here is: the right to goodwill from the other, although the right to emotional support is also a good one - also the right to receive a sincere apology for any jokes you find offensive, and the right to encouragement.\n\nI'd encourage you to read The Verbally Abusive Relationship by her, and see what you think.", "NTA...also...why are you with a man who doesn't take your deeply held religious beliefs seriously? It sounds like he's trying to get you to cave in and give it up. Did he get together with you thinking he could convert you?", "NTA but your title sucks. The issue doesn't seem to be eating when you can't, it's the fact that he is purposely taunting you. He clearly doesn't respect you, your culture, or your religion.", "NTA.  What\u2019s he getting out of this?  Is showing basic compassion too much to ask?\n\nPeople fast for a variety of reasons.  Religion.  Health.  Planned surgical procedures.  Whatever.  To intentionally eat your favorite meals when you are restricted from doing so is cruel.", "He is the AH. If you were imposing your religious practices on him, you would be the AH but him going to your favorite restaurant just to taunt you is a HUGE red flag. \n\nI'm atheist and there is no way I would stay with someone like that who goes out of their way to mock the faith of another. I may not agree with your religion but I respect your right to practice it if it makes you happy.", "NTA, but your husband is.  How did you end up married to this inconsiderate guy??", "I am not religious at all, but my husband is. He fasts for weeks / months at a time during certain holidays and every Wednesday & Friday. I've never once gone out of my way to grab his favorite dish to rub it in his face. He's being very disrespectful to your religion for seemingly no reason.. you're not the AH, but he certainly is. He's also extremely childish.\n\nAt first I didn't understand the fasting my husband did, but it's apart of his life and I support him 100%. Sometimes I do feel bad when I ask him to pick me up food on his way home from somewhere though when he is fasting, but he says he doesn't mind haha.", "Why did you date and then marry someone that so blatantly disrespectful to you and your religion?", "NTA, his actions ARE mean spirited. It\u2019s not hilarious and you aren\u2019t being sensitive. There\u2019s absolutely no reason for him to go out of his way for something this simple, and frankly he lacks the most basic respect.", "NTA\n\nAnd as someone who comes from a faith tradition with similar proscriptions, your husband isn't just being mean-spirited (though it's very generous of you to suggest that), he's being abusive. \n\nMean-spirited would be mocking your faith or eating in front of you deliberately AT ALL. Fasting is incredibly difficult, and while yes, it is a choice, that doesn't mean that it's fun or enjoyable, or that you are meant to suffer for it. And anyone who says, \"Well just don't do it then\" is ignorant and childish, suggesting that you give up your most deeply held beliefs, and traditions that are sometimes thousands of years old and incredibly meaningful to you, just because they are difficult . . . most fasting traditions are MEANT to be difficult, and that's part of why we do them.\n\nBut the abusive part is twofold: first of all, because your husband is *going out of his way to make something that is already difficult for you significantly more unpleasant, harder, and even more emotionally and physically distressing.* That is flat-out sadistic, and treating your spouse sadistically is abusive.  Secondly, because *he derives actual joy from hurting you*. He is laughing and mocking you*.* That isn't something that we do to people we love. Again, only a sadist, an abusive person, takes pleasure in exacerbating the suffering of someone they are supposed to love. \n\nI suspect that it's very unlikely that this is the only area in which your husband treats you so cruelly. Please, think hard about this relationship. This is not love. Mocking and humiliating you and making your life more painful and difficult is not the act of a loving partner. You deserve so much better. You deserve someone who, even if they don't share your faith, lifts you up and treats you and your beliefs with respect.", "NTA, as your husband is being a jerk", "NTA he's being blatantly disrespectful. I don't particularly like religion but I also wouldnt treat another person like shit because of it. Find a better husband, you deserve better", "NTA. That\u2019s really horrible. It\u2019s Disrespectful and belittling and he\u2019s putting quite an organised effort into it. \n\nAre you sure this is the only way in which your husband is deliberately cruel and mocking towards you?", "NTA but your husband is a bully. Not only does he disrespect your religious beliefs, he gets his jollies from eating your favorite dishes in front of you when you\u2019re fasting. I\u2019d think long and hard about your future with this man, he\u2019s openly mocking in a cruel fashion, over and over again, the person who he is supposed to love the most.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know y\u2019all\u2019s dynamic, but it sounds like if you\u2019re telling him that he\u2019s being mean spirited and his response is that you\u2019re \u201cdoing it to yourself,\u201d he doesn\u2019t really like or respect your dietary restrictions and is subtly kind of hinting that you should change your behavior without coming right out and saying it. Personally I think that a more candid conversation saying it\u2019s hurtful and you want him to stop eating your *favorite food* from your *favorite restaurant* might be a good idea to have with him. The fact he\u2019s doing that from your favorite places is really mean and targeted in my opinion.\n\nYou\u2019re not being too sensitive at all, and those are totally understandable feelings you\u2019re having.", "He doesn\u2019t just not respect her dietary needs, he doesn\u2019t respect her religion. I\u2019m not religious myself, but I respect others choices in the matter. I bc respect strangers who have different dietary needs due to religion. This man can\u2019t be arsed to respect his wife!\n\nI was all ready to say that this was a her problem based off the title. He\u2019s allowed to eat what he wants. But the \u201cyou\u2019re doing this to yourself\u201d remark was extremely disrespectful to OP and her beliefs.", "I was totally prepared to come in here all \"How dare\" because you were trying to force your religious restrictions on someone not of the faith. \n\nThen, I actually read the post. Yeah, no. Definitely NTA. He is deliberately being an ass and mocking you for your faith, and he needs to stop.\n\nWhat else does he mock/demean/dismiss?", "NTA. He\u2019s trying to hurt you with this behavior, by going way out of his way to do it.", "NTA\n\nYour husband has the full intention of being TA because if he loves you or cares about you, he would respect your traditions. \n\nNOW, I am not saying he can't eat those meals, but being blatantly disrespectful to you by purposefully antagonizing you with them and then making snarky remarks about it, is just awful. It is disgusting. People can eat what they want to but do NOT be disrespectful about other people's beliefs.", "NTA. Not following your restrictions and eating what he feels like would be reasonable even if  frustrating for you, but repeatedly & deliberately going out of his way to get specific food to taunt you and then blaming you for being too sensitive is a major AH move.", "NTA. I\u2019m gonna be honest, based on the title I was all set to anti OP on this. I figured this was a \u201cI\u2019m observing my beliefs and he has the audacity not to completely change his normal routine to accommodate my beliefs he doesn\u2019t share,\u201d thing. But no, your partner is going out of his way to actively disrespect your beliefs and undermine your will power to be \u201cfunny.\u201d That\u2019s hella toxic. That would be like drinking a bottle of bourbon in front of a recovering alcoholic who is asking you not to, and then laughing and calling them sensitive for walking away.", "See here's the thing, if he was just normally eating (even if it's something you like) then you'd be unreasonable. \n\nBut what he's doing is purposely flaunting it in front of you.\n\nMaybe the first time it could be funny and you could have a laugh.\n\nBut repeatedly doing it is just asshole behavior on his part.\n\nSo NTA.", "NTA - Your husband is being incredibly disrespectful disregarding your religious practices. He is ridiculing something important to you and expecting you to compromise your beliefs for him.", "I don\u2019t think so, he knows you can\u2019t have it during that time and purposely goes out his way to get it. Just to eat it in front of you. If he ever gets into a situation, or is in one, where he can\u2019t eat a food he really likes, eat lots of it in front of him I say. Make sure to make comments about how good it is too. ;)", "NTA, he\u2019s extremely immature. I\u2019m not religious in the slightest but when I visited Egypt during Ramadan I even tried to hide myself drinking water which was hard as it was over 40 degrees Celsius and I needed a lot but it\u2019s out of respect. I don\u2019t agree with the religion but I\u2019m not going to disrespect it because well, to each their own.", "I fast a lot too and my husband would never.

It\u2019s a very, very vicious thing to do, IMO, your husband should be ashamed of himself but sadly, it doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.

He's doing it to himself by taunting you anyway. He has the choice to not be an ass if he wanted to so he shouldn't really get irritated at you. Or do you have family friends you can go to instead that won't blatantly taunt you while you're fasting?", "Personally,this may not be one of your concerns but why would you be with someone who doesn\u2019t share the same beliefs as you and will gourmet you during your religious fasting.you are totally NTA since he is taunting you and ridiculing you and he will not understand be you do not share the same beliefs.That would be the main part I look in,if they have a similar backround? Same religion? It will be very hard in your marriage if you cannot live together without similar options.", "NTA.

And if I expect people to respect my choice not to have anything to do with religion, then I must extend that same courtesy to those who do choose to partake in religion, whether I agree with them or not, unless their religion is actively hurting someone, which fasting does not.", "You won\u2019t ever convince anyone with your approach, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. \nIf you simply would like to mock and bash religion, proceed. \nI can\u2019t stop you, you\u2019re not really doing anything but hurting some feelings so\u2026\ud83e\udd37", "What\u2019s funny is you dismissing her religious beliefs as \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201cillegitimate\u201d. This post was not created with the intent to discuss the accuracy of religion, but rather the husband\u2019s improper behaviour towards OP. If OP believes in her religion, then she is free to practice it and follow any obligations that come along with it. The husband is clearly being insensitive to said obligations which ironically you seem to support. To me, it seems like you\u2019re a little frustrated. Everything okay at home?", "Even if you don\u2019t respect them, it makes you TA to mock them. You don\u2019t have to respect the religion to respect your partner.", "You know how YOU have the right to NOT believe? They have the SAME right to believe. You're an asshole for this comment. Shes not forcing him to participate. Hes allowed to eat when shes not but to go out of his was to bully her is disgusting and I feel like you arw a shitass bully yourself. Sit the FUCK down and shut the FUCK up", "You might have a point if OP was trying to force her husband to fast as well, but she's not.  Her issue isn't that he's eating, it's the fact that he is intentionally buying food he knows she likes and eating it in front of her.", "So you won\u2019t respect anyone who has different opinions, views and beliefs than you? Figured. I pray the hate in your heart goes away.", "Most people don't follow religion to a T. Someone fasting is not following a horrific belief. There's even health benefits to fasting on occasion. Right now you are assuming that since OP follows a religion, OP holds horrific beliefs.\n\nYou are judging religious people the same way they judge us. They think that if someone doesn't follow a book of moral codes they have no morals, same as you think that following a book that has outdated terrible beliefs means they're all assholes.", "Tell me you lack self-awareness without telling me you lack self-awareness.", "People of his kind are ones that insult anyone with a different view of the world than him. So yes.\n\nNot all atheists are extremely rude and insensitive with a \"I know everything complex\"\n\nBut I'm describing a specific type of atheist... one that feels the need to belittle or put down anyone who is spiritual. It's pathetic.", "Key word: suggested.", "[removed]", "Not true. I've gotten quite a few people to stop believing in their delusional nonsense by repeatedly pointing out that it is delusional nonsense. That's in real life of course, not sure if it's ever happened online, but it likely has. I know my daughter stopped believing in Christianity because of similar arguments she had online with others when she was 12.\n\nReligion is not worthy of response more than any other nonsensical beliefs, such as leprechauns or the loch ness monster.", "If his wife believed that she had to throw salt over her shoulder to ward off evil spirits, I would support her husband mocking that belief. It's no different.\n\nI'm happy at home. Closest thing to a \"frustration\" I have is too much free time. So, ad hominem aside, I am stating what I am stating because it is what I believe to be true. Religions are nonsense and worthy of mockery akin to belief in bigfoot or faeries.", "If my wife believes in ghosts, would I be an asshole for making fun of it? It's nonsense. Just because we label this particular brand of nonsense \"religion\" doesn't change it.", "Sure, I will. Also, respecting a person is not the same as respecting their beliefs. \n\nI don't hate religious people. I just think that religions are despicable immoral nonsense.", "The irony of the argument that the guy you originally responded to is making, is that atheism and theism are so similar. \n\nIf you cut a God shaped hole out of a piece of paper, you get the God shape and the negative left in the paper it was cut from. They are opposite that are identical in all but one way. \n\nAthiests have to accept the premise of the question in order to reject it.\n\nWhy does he even care? Why so militant about something that doesnt affect him? Not giving a shit is a far better and more rational conclusion to reach. \n\nIt sounds like he is preaching, that what he is saying is dogma, and that the evidence that 'its nonsense' is faith-based.", "Relevant to you. This isnt about you. Or religion. Its about the husband's behaviour.", "Quite frankly it\u2019s irrelevant if the belief is irrational for you or not. These traditions and beliefs have deep historical and cultural significance for many people, including OP; if you can\u2019t respect that, just don\u2019t be an asshole about it and move on. Doesn\u2019t cost anything to be nice!", "It's people like you that gives atheists a bad name. Not all religions are about believing in a magical sky daddy that's akin to bigfoot.", "Yeah, you would be. If she tells you making fun of her makes her uncomfortable and upset, and your response was to keep doing it and tell her she\u2019s too sensitive when she reacts in the exact way you\u2019re intending to make her react, you\u2019d be an AH", "Judging from your comments, seems like you don\u2019t respect the person either. How does it bother you what a person believes in? If someone believes in a God, or Bigfoot, or aliens, how does that affect you and your way of living for you to go and disrespect them?", "[removed]", "Feeding in to the delusion of religion has many costs and causes a lot of suffering.", "Aliens and bigfoot believers aren't the most influential voting block in America; religious people are.", "If a person believes in a religion that tells them being gay is immoral, or abortions are immoral, or that women shouldn't have certain rights and they vote accordingly,  that affects me and my way of living.", ">it actually is about me\n\nLmao. I cant imagine the jumble of thought that leads to you actually thinking this is all about you. Wow.", "Is it really fair to generalise that all religions are delusional and contribute to suffering?", "Yes and yes.", "Then we\u2019ll have to agree to disagree. But, one thing worthy of note is how you\u2019ve just disregarded the FACT that religion often serves as a means of guidance and moral values for many people. It fosters a sense of community and belonging, providing for example opportunities for personal and spiritual growth. Doesn\u2019t seem like a cause of \u201csuffering\u201d to me, and the other 5.8 billion religious people."]}
