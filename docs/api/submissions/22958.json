He's taunting you, and he's enjoying it. That's the opposite of loving behavior.\n\nI really like the author Patricia Evans - she has a list of rights in a relationship. The one that I think most applies here is: the right to goodwill from the other, although the right to emotional support is also a good one - also the right to receive a sincere apology for any jokes you find offensive, and the right to encouragement.\n\nI'd encourage you to read The Verbally Abusive Relationship by her, and see what you think.", "NTA...also...why are you with a man who doesn't take your deeply held religious beliefs seriously? It sounds like he's trying to get you to cave in and give it up. Did he get together with you thinking he could convert you?", "NTA but your title sucks. The issue doesn't seem to be eating when you can't, it's the fact that he is purposely taunting you. He clearly doesn't respect you, your culture, or your religion.", "NTA.  What\u2019s he getting out of this?  Is showing basic compassion too much to ask?\n\nPeople fast for a variety of reasons.  Religion.  Health.  Planned surgical procedures.  Whatever.  To intentionally eat your favorite meals when you are restricted from doing so is cruel.", "He is the AH. If you were imposing your religious practices on him, you would be the AH but him going to your favorite restaurant just to taunt you is a HUGE red flag. \n\nI'm atheist and there is no way I would stay with someone like that who goes out of their way to mock the faith of another. I may not agree with your religion but I respect your right to practice it if it makes you happy.", "NTA, but your husband is.  How did you end up married to this inconsiderate guy??", "I am not religious at all, but my husband is. He fasts for weeks / months at a time during certain holidays and every Wednesday & Friday. I've never once gone out of my way to grab his favorite dish to rub it in his face. He's being very disrespectful to your religion for seemingly no reason.. you're not the AH, but he certainly is. He's also extremely childish.\n\nAt first I didn't understand the fasting my husband did, but it's apart of his life and I support him 100%. Sometimes I do feel bad when I ask him to pick me up food on his way home from somewhere though when he is fasting, but he says he doesn't mind haha.", "Why did you date and then marry someone that so blatantly disrespectful to you and your religion?", "NTA, his actions ARE mean spirited. It\u2019s not hilarious and you aren\u2019t being sensitive. There\u2019s absolutely no reason for him to go out of his way for something this simple, and frankly he lacks the most basic respect.", "NTA\n\nAnd as someone who comes from a faith tradition with similar proscriptions, your husband isn't just being mean-spirited (though it's very generous of you to suggest that), he's being abusive. \n\nMean-spirited would be mocking your faith or eating in front of you deliberately AT ALL. Fasting is incredibly difficult, and while yes, it is a choice, that doesn't mean that it's fun or enjoyable, or that you are meant to suffer for it. And anyone who says, \"Well just don't do it then\" is ignorant and childish, suggesting that you give up your most deeply held beliefs, and traditions that are sometimes thousands of years old and incredibly meaningful to you, just because they are difficult . . . most fasting traditions are MEANT to be difficult, and that's part of why we do them.\n\nBut the abusive part is twofold: first of all, because your husband is *going out of his way to make something that is already difficult for you significantly more unpleasant, harder, and even more emotionally and physically distressing.* That is flat-out sadistic, and treating your spouse sadistically is abusive.  Secondly, because *he derives actual joy from hurting you*. He is laughing and mocking you*.* That isn't something that we do to people we love. Again, only a sadist, an abusive person, takes pleasure in exacerbating the suffering of someone they are supposed to love. \n\nI suspect that it's very unlikely that this is the only area in which your husband treats you so cruelly. Please, think hard about this relationship. This is not love. Mocking and humiliating you and making your life more painful and difficult is not the act of a loving partner. You deserve so much better. You deserve someone who, even if they don't share your faith, lifts you up and treats you and your beliefs with respect.", "NTA, as your husband is being a jerk", "NTA he's being blatantly disrespectful. I don't particularly like religion but I also wouldnt treat another person like shit because of it. Find a better husband, you deserve better", "NTA. That\u2019s really horrible. It\u2019s Disrespectful and belittling and he\u2019s putting quite an organised effort into it. \n\nAre you sure this is the only way in which your husband is deliberately cruel and mocking towards you?", "NTA but your husband is a bully. Not only does he disrespect your religious beliefs, he gets his jollies from eating your favorite dishes in front of you when you\u2019re fasting. I\u2019d think long and hard about your future with this man, he\u2019s openly mocking in a cruel fashion, over and over again, the person who he is supposed to love the most.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know y\u2019all\u2019s dynamic, but it sounds like if you\u2019re telling him that he\u2019s being mean spirited and his response is that you\u2019re \u201cdoing it to yourself,\u201d he doesn\u2019t really like or respect your dietary restrictions and is subtly kind of hinting that you should change your behavior without coming right out and saying it. Personally I think that a more candid conversation saying it\u2019s hurtful and you want him to stop eating your *favorite food* from your *favorite restaurant* might be a good idea to have with him. The fact he\u2019s doing that from your favorite places is really mean and targeted in my opinion.\n\nYou\u2019re not being too sensitive at all, and those are totally understandable feelings you\u2019re having.", "He doesn\u2019t just not respect her dietary needs, he doesn\u2019t respect her religion. I\u2019m not religious myself, but I respect others choices in the matter. I bc respect strangers who have different dietary needs due to religion. This man can\u2019t be arsed to respect his wife!\n\nI was all ready to say that this was a her problem based off the title. He\u2019s allowed to eat what he wants. But the \u201cyou\u2019re doing this to yourself\u201d remark was extremely disrespectful to OP and her beliefs.", "I was totally prepared to come in here all \"How dare\" because you were trying to force your religious restrictions on someone not of the faith. \n\nThen, I actually read the post. Yeah, no. Definitely NTA. He is deliberately being an ass and mocking you for your faith, and he needs to stop.\n\nWhat else does he mock/demean/dismiss?", "NTA. He\u2019s trying to hurt you with this behavior, by going way out of his way to do it.", "NTA\n\nYour husband has the full intention of being TA because if he loves you or cares about you, he would respect your traditions. \n\nNOW, I am not saying he can't eat those meals, but being blatantly disrespectful to you by purposefully antagonizing you with them and then making snarky remarks about it, is just awful. It is disgusting. People can eat what they want to but do NOT be disrespectful about other people's beliefs.", "NTA. Not following your restrictions and eating what he feels like would be reasonable even if  frustrating for you, but repeatedly & deliberately going out of his way to get specific food to taunt you and then blaming you for being too sensitive is a major AH move.", "NTA. I\u2019m gonna be honest, based on the title I was all set to anti OP on this. I figured this was a \u201cI\u2019m observing my beliefs and he has the audacity not to completely change his normal routine to accommodate my beliefs he doesn\u2019t share,\u201d thing. But no, your partner is going out of his way to actively disrespect your beliefs and undermine your will power to be \u201cfunny.\u201d That\u2019s hella toxic. That would be like drinking a bottle of bourbon in front of a recovering alcoholic who is asking you not to, and then laughing and calling them sensitive for walking away.", "See here's the thing, if he was just normally eating (even if it's something you like) then you'd be unreasonable. \n\nBut what he's doing is purposely flaunting it in front of you.\n\nMaybe the first time it could be funny and you could have a laugh.\n\nBut repeatedly doing it is just asshole behavior on his part.\n\nSo NTA.", "NTA - Your husband is being incredibly disrespectful disregarding your religious practices. He is ridiculing something important to you and expecting you to compromise your beliefs for him.", "I don\u2019t think so, he knows you can\u2019t have it during that time and purposely goes out his way to get it. Just to eat it in front of you. If he ever gets into a situation, or is in one, where he can\u2019t eat a food he really likes, eat lots of it in front of him I say. Make sure to make comments about how good it is too. ;)", "NTA, he\u2019s extremely immature. I\u2019m not religious in the slightest but when I visited Egypt during Ramadan I even tried to hide myself drinking water which was hard as it was over 40 degrees Celsius and I needed a lot but it\u2019s out of respect.

Same religion? It will be very hard in your marriage if you cannot live together without similar options.", "NTA.
