I have a son (14) and a daughter (12) with my ex-wife and my wife has a son (7) with her ex-husband. We all moved in together in late 2021. My kids get along great with their stepbrother and they adore me wife. I have had a trickier time bonding with my stepson. We have my kids every other week and my stepson goes to his dads every other weekend. \n\nMy stepson is a massive daddy's boy. His dad takes him on some kind of \"adventure\" every weekend they're together. He is always talking about what he is going to do with his dad or what he and his dad did at the weekend. Which is annoying but fine. However, recently he keeps comparing me to his dad. Saying things his dad would do differently or telling me his dad can do something so I should be able to too. \n\nLast weekend we went camping, which is something we've not really done before as a family. When it came to building a campfire my stepson started complaining I was doing it wrong (I was following a YouTube tutorial) and tried to interfer with what I was doing. Then he said \"how are you a man but don't even know how to make a fire\" before going on to talk about how his dad could light a fire with a stick. I was already stressed about the whole weekend and I ended up snapping at him and telling to shut up about his dad. \n\nObviously, I was in the wrong for snapping. After finishing the fire I went to apologies to him and let him know I was in the wrong for talking to him like that. I did however, reaffirm that I would like it if he stopped talking about his dad so much. \n\nLater in the week he must of said something to my wife about not being allowed to mention his dad. She is now mad at me for having this discussion with him even though I know she finds it annoying as well. In truth I have always felt self conscious about my wife's ex-husband as he is very stereotypically masculine guy (ex-marine) and I'm the opposite. My wife's sister called me an \"over correction\" to my face a few months into dating. It's also frustrating to see how much my stepson idolises his dad when he doesn't know how much his dad hurt his mom. He cheated on her, was abusive, and continued to financially abuse her post separation. His dad has refused to have any more custody time with his son and even when we went on our honeymoon last year he sent his son to his moms rather than look after him himself. I know how much it hurts my wife to see her son favor his dad when he does the bare minimum as a father and damaged her so badly. AITA for suggesting he stops talking about his dad so much?", "created_utc": 1678367603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mrv2i/aita_for_telling_my_stepson_to_stop_talking_about/", "score": 1939, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is 7 and is dealing with the divorce and a new family but he is 7.  Get over any feelings of inferiority and jealousy.  You should be encouraging him to have a good relationship with his dad.  Even if he was awful to your wife, your step son needs to have his own separate relationship with him.  When he is older and is emotionally mature enough you can broach those subjects with him.\n\nIn the present, you may want to focus on showing him there are different ways to do things.  Explain that your father can have his way of living and you do things differently.  Neither way is better than the other, but they work for each of you.  Masculinity cannot be defined with only one example.  Show him why you are the way you are and provide a role model that you can be proud of.\n\nGood luck!", "YTA. The kid is 7 - *of course* he doesn\u2019t have a deep understanding of the intricacies of his parents relationship and *of course* he idolizes and talks about his father. He\u2019s one of two of the most important people in his life. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re taking out your own insecurities on this kid. Just stop. If you think you\u2019re a better example of how a husband and father should act, then actually step up and show that to him instead of this petty BS.", "[deleted]", "\"Obviously, I was in the wrong for snapping.\"  YTA, big time, and **you already know it**.  How would you like your ex-wife's new man to say the same thing to your kids about you?!", "This is the whole wrong way to go about this and you're feeling way too personally threatened. You've made this about your ego, not about the kid. \n\nHe's seven, he's supposed to idolise his dad, not know how much his dad hurt his mom and he's definitely not supposed to hear that he shouldn't talk about his dad. Young children frequently favour the less stable parent (his dad) because they feel secure enough in their relationship with the stable parent (his mom) that they don't constantly need to express affection. \n\nInstead of making this into a you vs him issue, let your stepson talk about his dad. Include him in conversations. If the kid says that his dad can do it better, ask the kid to help you because maybe he already picked up a trick you don't know. Stop trying to compete and just focus on your own relationship with the kid.", "YTA - For gods sake, hes SEVEN YEARS OLD. Take your insecurities and sort yourself out.", "YTA. You are emotionally damaging a young child.", "ESH except for the kid. He is 7, he obviously gets a pass. His adoration for his father is natural and should be encouraged. But whatever sick mind games the father might be playing through the little kid should stop.\n\nThe biological father is an AH for sure, he is telling the kid things with obvious intent to harm the mother's current relationship.\n\nThe OP clearly overreacted and he knows it, he seems to be insecure about his relationship. He needs to realize his wife chose him because she doesn't think a man needs to be a macho, which is the truth.\n\nMother needs to find a way to make sure the boy does not make hurtful comments and probably talk to kid's father about the way he is teaching him to talk.", "Soft YTA. It sounds like your stepsons dad isn\u2019t teaching him good things (I can only assume he got that \u201chow are you a man..\u201d crap from his dad), but this is not the sort of thing you can force out of him. You\u2019re going to have to be gentle and patient. Ask him nicely not to compare you to his father. Be firm but fair about how things like that hurt your feelings and hurting others feelings is unkind. It\u2019s absolutely reasonable to not want him to make rude comments comparing you to his dad, but you\u2019ve got to handle it as an adult teaching a child.", "YTA. He's 7 how insecure are you. Doesn't matter what you think of his dad. In his eyes it doesn't matter what his dad has done. Later in life he'll figure things out. But what you're trying to do now. Will bite you when he's older.", "Soft YTA\n\nI get why this is frustrating and annoying and why you have feelings of resentment about the rugged dude type stuff compared to this guy even though logically your brain knows the ex was abusive and treated your wife awful an isn't really all that great to his kid considering he only wants the bare minimum time with his son.\n\nBut *the kid is seven*. You are an adult. Of course he idolizes his dad. Of course he's talking about his dad because he misses his dad. His dad is barely in his life (like 4 days a month) and talking about him when he's not there is probably his way of trying to keep him present somehow. \n\nSo I think your job as the adult is to change the subject. Not by saying \"don't talk about your dad\" but by redirecting. \"Hey, Stepson, help me start this fire.\" Give him stuff to do. Get him engaged with you. You won't ever replace his dad and that's okay. You can still be a great, super positive force in his life and over time as he gets older and more socially aware, this behavior will probably naturally decrease on its own.", "I'd narrow it a little more specifically, \"It's not nice to compare people. Everyone is different and has different abilities\"\n\nHe is young and may be parroting things his father says, especially if he was as abusive as indicated. He's trying to use his son to drive a wedge between you and your wife. That is something she needs to deal with, by talking to the son.\n\nI don't think anyone here is an asshole, just trying to navigate blending a family.\n\nNAH", "Yeah man, YTA. You said so yourself that you're self-conscious about your wife's ex. You list all the bad things he did to her, but that doesn't impact your relationship with her at all. Either you believe she's with you because she loves you and recognizes value in who you are, or you shouldn't be together.\n\nIn terms of the 7 year old child in this scenario, you're out of your mind. Of course he's going to idolize his big strong dad who only ever takes him when it's a fun adventure. He isn't a parent, he's a camp counselor. So take a deep breathe. Your stepson, unless he is an absolute idiot, will eventually see that you're a man in his life he can count on, and his dad is just a fun guy who bounces whenever he wants. In that time, your stepson will come to rely on you, trust you, love you, and value the relationship you have. But that can only happen if you don't act jealous of the deadbeat who fathered him. \n\nHe says you're building the fire wrong? Ask him how to do it right.", "YTA. But only for the way you went about the whole thing. If you had sat him down and had a calm conversation with him and even included your wife in the discussion it may have gone over better. Kids are smarter than people think and at seven he should be able to understand this on at least the lowest level. \n\nIt does sound to me like there are some underlying feelings on both sides and you could both benefit from some structured therapy.", "YTA. Youre jealous of another man and took it out on a child. Get a grip.", "YTA.  You are talking about a young child who had been through tremendous upheaval that he has had precisely zero control over.  He probably already feels very torn with divided loyalties to each of his parents, which you just made even worse for him by demanding that he not talk about his father around you.\n\nYou are the adult here, and he is the child.  It is entirely inappropriate to make him responsible for catering to your emotional needs and insecurities.", "What you should have said was \"please stop **comparing** me to your dad. I am so happy you have such a great relationship with him, but we are differnt people and have different ways of doing things. I try not to compare you to my son becuase you are different people. Do you understand?\"\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nAs the parent of a kid who idolises their dad and forgives them for everything, you need to deal with this in a different way.\n\nIf the kid says \"what kind of man doesn't know how to build a fire?\" Answer it somehow that is positive-ish. Maybe: A man that didn't grow up as lucky as him that had a dad and a stepdad that took him camping. Can you teach me? Bond with him another way. Show him that 'a man' can be many things. Someone who can build fires and chop wood and can paint toenails and vacume the floor. \n\nYes, you are going to hear a lot of 'my dad's the best' through the years, but up to the point it's hurtful or rude towards you, just go along with it. Tell him how lucky he is to have such an amazing dad. If it's rude, say/deal with that without making it about dad. \n\nIt sucks to have to smile and listen to how amazing the $#^#&\u00d7 arseh@#$ you know is and how they are the best. But they are the kids father and will be there for the forseeable future. Not playing into this pissing contest is going to help in the long term.\n\nBreathing exercises help \ud83d\ude0f", "YTA", "NTA. You should separate the kid from the dad completely though. It looks like he is learning wrong traits from the bio dad and I am 100% sure, the biodad talks shit about you. If he loves his bio dad so much, he can go live with him full time.", "YTA! \n\nBasically you're DEEPLY insecure of the man that created the son with your now wife, that's just something you will have to get over and live with! Glad your wife told you off!!!", "YTA  \nThe ex may have been an utterly terrible husband, but it sounds like he's a good dad to his son. Or the son thinks he's a great dad.   \nThe kid isn't talking about his dad to wind you up. He's talking about his dad because his dad is important to him and that's what kids talk about. (See also: pokemon, how delicious spaghetti is, how itchy a sock is and the 3 hour story about a cat that their friend owns)", "YTA This kid is still getting used to another man being in his life.  Of course there's going to be comparisons made. You as the adult have handled it all wrong.  Instead of shouting \"shut up don't talk about your dad\" you should've explained that \" its great your dad can do this but often times in life there's many different ways to do something and just because someone does something a different way doesn't mean its wrong. I'd like to try to do it this way but if it doesn't work then you can tell me how your dad does it and we'll give that a try\" then after maybe have a sit down and explain to him that \" me and your dad are different people we're not going to do everything the same way and I understand that that can be confusing for you. I love you and your mother very much and we all need to learn how to work together.\" Just realise you've suddenly come into the life of a 7 year old child thats a big thing for him. Its your job as the adult to try and understand him and yelling and forcing him to not talk bout his dad its not the way to do it.", "YTA for telling him to not talk about his dad. You were right to apologize for snapping but the discussion should have been about not being rude. Your stepson should be allowed to talk about his dad, he's his dad! If your stepson feels he can't talk about his dad he's going to resent the time he's with you. In his mind it's the evil stepdad who won't let him talk about his real dad. \n\nHe doesn't need to insult you to talk about his dad. That's what you should have focused on.", "YTA.\n\nIt doesn't matter if his dad was an abusive asshole, is a bad father, or if being compared to some hyper-masculine jarhead hurts your feelings. He's 7. None of that is his business or his responsibility.\n\nYou're the adult. Suck it up. He'll learn the truth about his father eventually. That's  inevitable. You should strive to be the man he can come to for guidance when that happens, not the one responsible for it.", "YTA\n\nHe's 7, he won't understand what his father did to his mother and the reasoning for divorce. Your anger at the ex husband is for every correct reason, but the kid won't understand it. Let your wife explain it him when he's older.\n\nFile for child support and days for custody, he's going to throw the kid at you and your wife out of jealousy at the important days of your marriage.\n\nTry and get him Jail time for what he did to your wife. I do feeling have that he's going to negatively influence the kid.", "Bro YTA\u2026 have you tried\u2026 correcting his behavior instead of snapping? He\u2019s old enough to understand the words \u201chey buddy! I know your dad is super cool and you love him, but it\u2019s really mean to compare two people together. It\u2019s starting to make me feel not good. You can talk about him still, but please stop making comparisons between us\u201d \n\nThe way you snapped at him, is probably making him feel like he is punished for having a cool dad, Which is wrong. You guys need to correct the behavior, not snap and make him feel bad", "YTA\n\nIt's not your place to talk like that to your wife's son. She's the parent and you need to butt out and suck it up.  Apologise to your stepson for being out of line about his dad and ask him to show you how to light a fire.\n\nYour relationship with your stepson is very tenuous.and it's not a good idea to judge and compare with the relationship your wife has with your own kids. He's allowed to idolise his dad and he should quite rightly not have any idea of the toxic relationship between his parents. \n\nAre you trying to be a second dad when the boy needs a friend or an uncle?", "yta. the child is 7 right now his hero is his dad. give it time his dad will do something to change the boys thinking be there to pick up the pieces when his world is shattered. stop being jealous you got the girl and in the 3nd you'll get the boy too just give it time without pressuring him.", "YTA. He's a kid! You need to grow up. If you're a better man be the better man because eventually the rose tinted glasses will fall off and when it inevitably does, you would have established a genuine relationship. He has a dad, don't try to be that. Just find your place in the life. You have no clue what the dad is saying to him and how he's feeling.", "YTA for telling him to talk about his dad less point blank.\n\nYTA for thinking that his dad\u2019s shitty behaviour is something that the child should be taking into account without knowing about it, or that it should be added into this right now - that\u2019s a delicate thing that needs a big strategy and deep conversations between you and your wife before you approach it because as right as it sounds like you are, trying to \u201cdamage\u201d his image of his dad is going to backfire on you guys first imo.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA for sounding to me like a much better father figure general though. Sounds like this is hard for you and being TA for snapping is something I can see as \u201cnobody\u2019s perfect\u201d even if an AH move at the time. But you apologised for that part. \n\nWhat you need to do is have a talk with your stepson that is absolutely NOT about talking about his dad less, but explaining that you\u2019re a different person who doesn\u2019t want to be negatively compared because that hurts you and you\u2019re not trying to be him. Not because you don\u2019t want to hear about his dad. Yeah there are things you\u2019re not good at - like building a fire - but you have plenty of different skills too, just like every person. And that those skills are really valuable too. People are different. You\u2019re different to his dad and also have a different relationship to him than his dad does. You don\u2019t want to replace him. Offer to meet in the middle with you not saying you don\u2019t want him to talk about his dad, but ask if he can respect there\u2019s no need for comparisons or being rude\u2026 you get my vibe.", "Soft YTA\n\nHe's 7. He will one day perhaps see or learn that his dad was not the best. There's no need to do that now. He probably idolizes him bc he misses him - and bc it does sound like he makes a real effort when he has him.\n\nYou were wrong to snap but mainly you were wrong to let a 7 yr old get under your skin when it's obvious he's just a parrot. His dad obv talks a lot about what a \"real man\" does or is.... and guess what, that is likely something his own dad did and the military definitely did and has NOTHING to do with you.\n\nYou can def sort out the comparisons by starting to compare HIM to other kids and say - is that fair or necessary? Why can't we be really excited that someone else is good at different things than us? Absolutely fair to address that but realize that he's a kid and maybe his dad IS awesome with him even if he sucks in plenty of other ways.", "YTA\n\nHe is just a child. You can't expect him to understand how it might make you feel when he brings up his father. On the other hand you're the adult, so maybe behave like one. \nI am not trying to be mean but if you feel threatened or belittled or I don't know what when he talks about his dad maybe you should try to work out why you feel that way.", "YTA. He's 7. Trying to process his broken family, a new family, and all the emotions of going back and forth between two households. You're the adult and you've dumped your insecurities onto him.", "YTA, he's going to idolise his dad till he figures it out on his own. Telling him to stop talking about his dad just makes you sound insecure and jealous. Just be like it's awesome your dad can do that, but everyone's different, you know?\"", "YTA. He's seven. SEVEN. You are an adult. You have no right to tell a little boy to not feel his feelings. The poor kid misses his dad. Come on now. Put on your big boy pants and adult here.\n\n I honestly think counseling would help you, and him a lot. Your comments reek with insecurity. She chose you. Apparently she felt you were up to the challenge of helping raise her son. That includes meeting him where he is at.", "NTA - clearly could have gone about it a little different and you were smart to realize that - but in the greater scheme of things, you have to set your boundaries - I have to wonder why his mom is angry if she doesn't appreciate all the talk about him either. Also, why hasn't she said anything to him up to this point? I get that the little guy loves his dad - I wouldn't want to change that - but it's easy when you're 7 and all you have is 'good times' with him.", "A 7 year old asking his step father \u201c how are you a man\u201d is completely inappropriate.

Find your own thing to do with him that is sufficiently different that he will love. Video games perhaps?", "NAH\n\nI can see why the kid does this, and I can see why it bothers you.\n\nHonestly I don't think there's much you can/should do though.  Maybe your wife could apply some gentle correction -- but at the same time, I doubt there's much point telling the kid all about his father's faults.", "Soft YTA for how you handled it: points for apologising, but it's true you can't tell your stepson not to talk about his dad. What you should have addressed in your apology imo is what he said, the \"how can you be a man\" stuff definitely jumps out. It looks like the dad is influencing him in a bad way, so I hope your wife and you can take steps to rectify that, make him understand what's wrong about that mindset and how it hurts people, etc.", "just from the heading YTA  his dad is obverly trying to be a dad and well you need to get use to that.

He is SEVEN.    \nWhatever connection he has with his father is all that he has known and of course he misses him.  Talking about him is his way of keeping that connection.  It's not time for him to make judgement's on either of his parents.  But he does have to make a judgement on whether or not you are a safe person in his life.  He's not saying what he is to deliberately hurt you.  He just needs to be heard by you and his mom.  Listen and agree with him on what you can, tell him gently that as different as you are from his dad, that you don't care any less for him then you do your own children.  And for the love of all, stop comparing yourself to the ex.  It's obvious you're not him and that should be something you are grateful for being!", "YTA. Your kid is always going to love his dad as a dad more than he is going to love you as a dad. Accept that.\n\n\nWhat you don\u2019t have to accept is that there is only one model for masculinity and that there are many different traits for a boy to admire in a man that aren\u2019t just stereotypically masculine. Instead of leaning into how you are and showing him how great you are as you (best step dad in the world), you showed him how fragile and sensitive you are because you AREN\u2019T the stereotypical manly man that your stepson currently prizes. \n\n\nYou\u2019re never likely to be his number one macho dad, but you absolutely can show him how great it is to be a man in other ways and how the world needs all types. Reframe how you look at this situation. It isn\u2019t your stepson being annoying because he loves his dad, it\u2019s you finding ways to inspire him with who you are and your actions, separately and incomparably to his dad. When he brings up how awesome his dad is, affirm that. Be bigger and braver by agreeing that things his dad does (note: not who his dad is, because he sounds like an asshole) are admirable. And then open the door to how approaching things other ways can be equally good, just different. And that it\u2019s good to have all kinds of tools in a tool box ranging from the most stereotypical to the least.", "YTA - he should be allowed to talk about his dad. What you can do is affirm with him that you are not his dad, and that you have other skills, and that being a man has nothing to do with abilities to lighting a fire. \n\nHe sees his dad 2 days out of 14. You are whether either of you like it or not the biggest male influence in his life. It also sounds like the major influence from his father is pretty toxic. So put yourself in role of that, instead of feeling inadequate to his father, remember you are not a toxic male and it is important to show this young boy what that means. Explain things to him. Talk to him. Demonstrate to him. \n\nHe will see it. And the more you\u2019re there for him. That you show up to him and his mum. That you demonstrate a healthy relationship and what positive masculinity is, the more he will learn from you and hopefully not turn out like his father.\n\nMost people start realising their parents flaws once they hit teenage years. It\u2019ll be much easier for him to grow into a good man if he has you there showing him the way.", "Don\u2019t tell him to stop talking about his dad, tell him not to COMPARE you to his dad. There is a difference.", "YTA - you are projecting your own adult insecurities and frustrations onto a child.   He's 7 and just trying to make sense out the fact that he idolizes his dad but clearly his mom and others (including you) do not.  And kids see themselves as an extension of their parents.  Trashing his dad = trashing him.", "YTA - this poor child is dealing with a broken marriage not of his making, with two parents he loves who are no longer together through no fault of his own, and this other random guy suddenly thrust into his life who is not his father but is around more than his real dad ... and very likely favors his own kids from his own broken marriage over him ... and now forbids him from talking about his father and yells at him about it. Your responses and actions are abusive and will damage him for life. Perhaps that is unavoidable, but you're not helping.\n\nAlso, \"daddy's boy\" isn't a thing, so let me help you \"he loves and looks up to his father\"", "Lmao, kid roasted you at the campfire.\n\nAlso you sound like will Ferrell in that movie with mark walhburg, daddy\u2019s home. Hilarious.", "YTA. If his dad is as bad as you claim, then your stepson will figure that out himself eventually. All you\u2019ve done by telling him to stop mentioning his dad is removed yourself as a person who he can come to for support when that happens.", "YTA You could\u2019ve asked your stepson to show you how his father builds the fire prior to lighting it. You also could\u2019ve asked him to stop unfavorably comparing you to him, rather than not talking about him at all. \n\nBe thankful that he thinks that his bio dad is great for now. You could be listening to the kid\u2019s adventures and learning what he likes, so that if his dad ends up abandoning him as a teen, you won\u2019t be a stranger to your stepson, and can be there for him. \n\nTeach him - by showing and discussion - how to be a man the way that you\u2019re a man. Hyper masculinity isn\u2019t the only way to be. Show him that there are other options. Be a safe place for him.\n\n\nPlease consider family therapy for you and your wife first; then with your stepson added, after the therapist has helped you both realize that you should be doing what you can to build a good foundation now with your child. He may really need you later on, if his father decides to be awful to him, too. (Which everyone hopes doesn\u2019t happen, of course.)", "YTA - That is his father, his hero. You need to work on getting a connection with your stepson and that is not by snapping at him or telling him to stop talking about his father.", "YTA. This does sound really frustrating from your point. But, he is a child and also dealing with a difficult situation. He doesn't have the coping skills that you have learned over your lifetime.

His comments weren\u2019t okay and I don\u2019t care what age you are, you can teach your kids manners. \n\nYou should not take it out on him but talk with your wife instead and figure out a way where you can talk with him about learning to stop comparing people and that everyone is different and has different skills and ability.", "NAH.   \n\n\nI don't really understand the \"YTAs\" when there's the Tough Guy dynamic coming from the kid's dad that's really tough to deal with, especially since the kid is seven.   \n\n\nBut here's the thing, and I think you actually know this: time and experience is going to be key with the stepson, his dad, and you. He obviously idolizes his dad, but he doesn't see how little time his dad actually spends with him, and that's going to show itself when he gets older. You being there as the \"antidote\" to the dad's hyper-masculinity can show the kid that men aren't all like his dad (and that's a good thing; everyone being the same is really boring). So obviously you now know it's not reasonable to tell the kid he can't talk about his dad in front of you; it's HOW he talks about him that's the issue, so make an age-appropriate explanation for him because he's only seven.  \n\n\nYou're going to have to be patient with him, and your wife really needs to step up and shut down bullshit from the family like her sister's \"over correction\" comment because that's just rude, especially if she knows what your wife went through with Mr. Man. I hope your wife tells her son why she isn't with his dad in the appropriate ways at the appropriate times. I hope you can be more patient with the kid, and give him life lessons about comparing different people the way he's currently doing with you and his dad.   \n\n\nGood luck!", "NAH. It sounds incredibly annoying and nobody likes being compared, and he was rude, obviously hanging out with his father rubbed off on him the worst way. The only AH is his father, and your wife for not doing anything about it.", "YTA.\n\nBeyond apologizing, you need to make it clear to your stepson that he can talk about his dad all he wants, it's just that you don't want to be compared to him.\n\nLonger term, he needs to understand that there are lots of different kinds of men and women in the world.  His dad may be a \"real man\" but he was a shitty husband and now what I call a \"15% parent.\"\n\nI'm sure his dad talks about \"real men\" all the time, including himself and excluding you.  Since he idolizes his dad, you won't get anywhere by disrespecting \"real men.\"  You could actually praise what is good about his father, tell him that only one man in a thousand is a marine or ex-marine.  Simply agree whole-heartedly that his dad is better at making fire (or whatever) than you are.\n\nYou can certainly talk about what makes a \"good parent\" and how you and your wife try to be that for your kids.

I have a son (14) and a daughter (12) with my ex-wife and my wife has a son (7) with her ex-husband. We all moved in together in late 2021. My kids get along great with their stepbrother and they adore me wife. I have had a trickier time bonding with my stepson. We have my kids every other week and my stepson goes to his dads every other weekend. \n\nMy stepson is a massive daddy's boy. His dad takes him on some kind of \"adventure\" every weekend they're together. He is always talking about what he is going to do with his dad or what he and his dad did at the weekend. Which is annoying but fine. However, recently he keeps comparing me to his dad. Saying things his dad would do differently or telling me his dad can do something so I should be able to too. \n\nLast weekend we went camping, which is something we've not really done before as a family. When it came to building a campfire my stepson started complaining I was doing it wrong (I was following a YouTube tutorial) and tried to interfer with what I was doing. Then he said \"how are you a man but don't even know how to make a fire\" before going on to talk about how his dad could light a fire with a stick. I was already stressed about the whole weekend and I ended up snapping at him and telling to shut up about his dad. \n\nObviously, I was in the wrong for snapping. After finishing the fire I went to apologies to him and let him know I was in the wrong for talking to him like that. I did however, reaffirm that I would like it if he stopped talking about his dad so much. \n\nLater in the week he must of said something to my wife about not being allowed to mention his dad. She is now mad at me for having this discussion with him even though I know she finds it annoying as well. In truth I have always felt self conscious about my wife's ex-husband as he is very stereotypically masculine guy (ex-marine) and I'm the opposite. My wife's sister called me an \"over correction\" to my face a few months into dating. It's also frustrating to see how much my stepson idolises his dad when he doesn't know how much his dad hurt his mom. He cheated on her, was abusive, and continued to financially abuse her post separation. His dad has refused to have any more custody time with his son and even when we went on our honeymoon last year he sent his son to his moms rather than look after him himself. I know how much it hurts my wife to see her son favor his dad when he does the bare minimum as a father and damaged her so badly. AITA for suggesting he stops talking about his dad so much?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He's also 7...\n\nYou are an adult, and you are buying into this somehow being a competition. It doesn't have to be.\n\nYour wife probably didn't tell your son all the awful things her ex did because she doesn't want to alienate him from his father. That time will come, and it will be up to her to handle it, but right now this boy is a little too young to dump that on.\n\nInstead of leaning into your resentment, try leaning into demonstrating the benefits of NONtoxic masculinity.", "NTA", "Soft YTA.

My step dad forced his way into a relationship which has definitely caused issues currently. There is nothing wrong with wanting a relationship with your stepson (I\u2019m glad you do!) but you can not wreck the one he has with his dad. He is 7, his dad is the coolest dude in his eyes right now. You may be morally better, but this kid is also going through a huge turn around in his life. \n\n\nYou\u2019re taking our your own insecurities on a 7 year old who isn\u2019t old enough to comprehend the situation. And even then, it\u2019s your stepsons choice whether or not he wants to continue that relationship. Not yours, not his moms (as long as he\u2019s paying child support and has custody obviously). \n\n\nHowever, I do think you and your wife need a talk. My mom grew to resent me after I kept favouring my dad because I never knew all the crappy things he did. I\u2019m not saying you should lay everything on the kid, again he\u2019s only 7. So you also need to keep that in mind.", "YTA\n\nBUT,\n\nI think his dad is feeding him some of that information. Kid has no understanding on how to process the information and make judgement. I have a strong feeling that his dad is trying to alienate him by doing \"adventures\" every time the child visits him, and by highlighting how much more of a \"man\" he is compared to you.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I had a friend whose parents were getting divorced. They were already separated but the dad kept dragging the divorce in court. He would give my friend anything and everything he asked for, then would highlight how his mom was not able to buy him cool gadgets/trips/expensive clothes. When his mom started dating someone else the dad got way worse, to the point my friend thought his mom was a bad parent (she wasn't, she just was financially drained by the divorce). His mom got engaged, then the dad moved to Florida and wanted custody of my friend. My friend was ecstatic! He visited his dad right after the wedding, and was promised a trip to Disney! Once he is in Florida, and they are driving to Disney, dad call his mom and tells that my friend wanted to live permanently in Florida. His mom said: Thats fine with me! Right there his dad turned around and went back. A week later my friend was back with his mom. Guy got no Disney trip, and his dad disappeared for a couple of years.", "YTA. Look  he's 7, his dad, no matter how much of an abusive ahole he is, is still his father and will continue to favor him whether you like it or not. You just have to deal with it and find ways of dealing with it, not lash out at the kid for choosing to idolize his dad over you. I'm pretty sure your wife is aware and it hurts her immensely but she has to put those feelings aside so the kid can have somewhat stability coparenting. I suggest you follow her lead. Maybe one day the kid will realize how much of a prick his dad is when he gets older.\n\nAs for bonding with him, dude it takes time, so don't force it or you'll end up the topic of a reddit post in the future.", "YTA. He\u2019s 7. You don\u2019t get to dictate to him how he processes what has happened in his young life. Next time say \u201cyes, your dad can do it, but I can\u2019t.

He lets him eat as much sugar as he wants and he never has a bed time at his house. Yep, I can see why he was getting frustrated with his mother who wanted him to sometimes eat a vegetable and also not fall asleep in school. But my nephew loved his dad, and also wished he was better, and felt this need to preemptively defend him against his very accurate failings that at 6 my nephew already felt but couldn't articulate.\n\nThis behavior stopped after a year or two as my nephew came to terms with just how disappointing his dad was.\n\nWas it frustrating listening to my nephew talk about how great his absolutely crap father was and blame his mother for him not getting more time with him when his dad moved across the state and frequently flaked on picking him up? Yep. Would going off on a 6yo help that situation? Nope. He figured it out in time.\n\nIdk how OP parented two kids to being teenagers and has so little patience and such huge insecurities that he would be upset that a 7yo didn't find him \"manly\" enough.\n\nEdit: thank you for the gold, kind stranger.

His father is emotionally abandoning him, you have hurt feelings so you think its a child's fault for being \"annoying\", and I don't know what your wife is doing but she needs to do better.", "YTA. It\u2019s his dad. You have no right to have that expectation of him.If you have insecurities deal with them on your own. And his relationship or lack there off with his mom has nothing to do with his relationship with his dad They are two separate things. Sort this out before you traumatize the poor kid more!", "Yta but it is not too late to redo this and make it right again! He is seven years old, he probably notices that his dad chooses to not spend as much time with him as he could and if not he will notice very soon. He sees daily how his mom and you.do the everyday things with him and his siblings, even though you probably work and have a lot of other things happening every day. How come his dad can't do that? My kids started to notice that sort of things around i years old about adults around them, seeing through their bullsh*t. This will only get worse - what happens as he gets older and doesn't want to be doing the fun things his father likes? What if he gets into gaming or has a girlfriend - or a boyfriend? His father will probably struggle to become the not-idolized dad. \nYou on the other hand will continue to be there and be the \"norm\". \n\nSo sit down with him, apologise and tell him that he is allowed to talk about his dad and that you want to know everything about your kid and that means that you also want to hear about the fun things - and all other things - that happens at his fathera house. And maybe bring up that what made you sad was not him talking about his father really but him saying something hurtful. Because you DO get sad if he says things about you being bad, but that has nothing to do with his dad, you get sad if someone at work says something mean too. Everyone gets sad sometimes. \n\nBe the rolemodel he needs! If he told you that you're not man enough then he probably have heard those exact words from his father. That shows that you and your wife has to do what you can to go against that, since that shows quite toxic masculinity and you don't want him to grow up and copy his fathers behaviour..", "Yes, YTA. I\u2019m in a similar shitty situation but it is uncalled for for you to hurt a 7 year old like that. That\u2019s his family. You just need to say \u201cthat\u2019s nice\u201d and move on. He can say it, it is his experience, but you don\u2019t have to engage. He\u2019s 7. This is entirely normal for this age.", "YTA- it\u2019s normal for a seven year old to idolize his dad.

His relationship with his dad is nothing to do with how his parents were together. The boy idolises him and you have no right to take that away from him. You have no right to tell him not to talk about his dad either - he's 7 for goodness sake! Of course he's going to idolise his dad!  \n\n\nYou come across as pretty jealous. Try working on that.

His dad came back and since then my stepson has been told to stop mentioning me around his dad. Children are not responsible for your feeling of inadequacies or your emotions, seek some therapy and get a hold of them yourself. Whatever the dad did to your wife is irrelevant. It can be very hard, I completely understand. It breaks my heart a little bit whenever he asks to see his dad but that\u2019s MY issue, at the very least I\u2019ve created a safe enough space that he can actually say that around me and his mom as opposed to his dads house where he can\u2019t mention either one of use because he feels responsible for his dads emotions. You should tell him that you deserve a little more respect and that the way he\u2019s been talking to you is completely inappropriate but do not tell him that he can\u2019t speak about his dad. That is what makes you a massive AH imo. (I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a nice enough guy though apart from this)", "YTA - Your insecurity is amazing. This boy is 7years is old. Of course he is comparing you to his father. That is what 7 year old kids do! He is learning. He sees his dad, and knows his dad is a man. What his dad does is what men do. He sees you are different and literally questions everything he knows to this point. Trust me, he is doing this in other areas as well. Instead of feeling attacked, use these as teachable moments. When he questions how a man does not know how to start a fire, just explain that different men know different things. And don't use this as an opportunity to take a shot at his dad. We all like different things, we all have different abilities. Teach him the world from your perspecitive. He will be richer for it.", "YTA because you shouldn't tell a kid not to talk about their parent. Your frustration is understandable and I empathize. But the kid is seven.

Proved him right. Edit YTA", "YTA - as other have mentioned, he\u2019s 7. Kids that age are sponges for what people say around them, and will repeat it.\n1. You are likely the polar opposite of the ex. There is a reason for that. More importantly, she chose you over that. \n2. The kid idolizes his dad because he gets to go for these \u201cadventures\u201d - he doesn\u2019t spend enough time with dad to learn what as POS he is. You don\u2019t want to be the one to try to show him either, that will blow back on you. Good advice has been given - talk to him about \u201ccomparing\u201d, not about just talking about his dad.\n3. Want to develop a bond? Don\u2019t try to be the guy your ex chose not to be with. Find things you enjoy to share with him. Teach him what you know about those things, and that you are good at. Also - let him teach you. When you were struggling with the fire, instead of getting upset that he was making comments, ask him to do it himself, and teach you.  I deal with kids this age often, teaching things like outdoor skills, and quite often their parents know nothing about it either. Kids take great pride in doing things like that, and his focus is no longer on what you don\u2019t know. Hand in hand with that, he is spending positive time with you, which is good for that bond. \n4. Look to join an activity or group with the boy, which can be something you two share. Slightly petty, but how good would it feel to know he is going back to dad talking about the adventures you have together? Just an example, I am a Scout leader. Our volunteers often come to us with little to no experience, and we teach them too. We often comment that we just need to learn these things ourselves before we teach the youth, and just need to keep one step ahead of them. You don\u2019t have to be amazing at something to look like you are to a 7 year old.\n5. Just a gut feeling here - your confidence is your biggest challenge, not who you are. Don\u2019t let your self doubt poison your relationships. You need to carefully look at what you have to offer your wife and your son. Learn your strengths, and become comfortable with them. Take comfort in them, and lean on them, use them to present your best. Figure out what areas you truly need to grow, and focus on those to help build your self-confidence. Also figure out your weaknesses, and take a good hard look at what is truly an area you need to grow,  versus what you are only calling a weakness because of what you are trying to compare yourself to. I know some very awesome, well loved dads and step dads who would compare very poorly if you tried to measure their worth based on fitting the traditional \u201cmanly man\u201d archetype, but they are still well loved all the same. For example, I would be willing to bet bio dad is shit at actually being supportive, and will not be someone your son is going to go to when he needs to talk, or have an open dialogue about something. You can become that person, but it starts now, with building trust.", "ESH. You all need therapy. This kid is 7.", "Yta. He's a seven year old kid.

When he was with his dad and I, this is OUR house, so what THEY did didn't matter here as we do things differently. Now, if he thought they had a better/easier way of doing things, I'd love to hear it, but pretty much didn't want to hear \"they do it different\" just because they do it different. He learned to think things thru in that regard, and even told his mom and stepdad what WE did different and possibly easier.  But out-and-out insults, like asking how you were a man if you couldn't build a fire?

It is not an easy job, and certainly not for the over-sensitive. \n\nIf you don't like comparing unfavorably, then make sure you compare favorably. That's on you, and all you can do. Knowing what you know about his father, you probably should have figured out basic stuff like starting a campfire before decididing to take the family camping. Did you not learn these skills growing up? I learned basic skills like that in the Boy Scouts, when I was 12. I would not dream of taking my family camping otherwise. Your step-son knows enough to recognize this at 7, and he's right.  \n\nThe father has an advantage, not just because he had a significant head-start, but because he gets the easier task of fun weekend adventures, rather than the day-to-day not so fun stuff, like dealing with school, his step-siblings, and getting him to keep his room clean. Deal with it.   \nGiven your disadvantages, you have to play your game at a much higher level. \n\nDo not disparage their father. I don't care what kind of stories you've heard from your wife, because they are surely biased, and only one side of the story. Rise above that stuff. You and the father are on the same team, raising HIS son. Never forget that. You do not replace the father. You supplment the father.  \n\nOh, and there's no such thing as an \"ex-Marine\". Once a Marine, always a Marine. Definitely do not hold that against him. You should openly admire that about him, if you know what is good for you. Have a sense of humor about it. Keep some crayons around, for him to snack on. The manliest thing you could do would be to swallow your pride, and ask him to teach you how to build a fire. Be the bigger person, and let your step-son see that. \n\nYou make this into a problem, more than anyone. You can choose to turn that around, and keep your insecurities about it to yourself. You need to lead your household, and demonstrate what that bigger man looks like, for not just your step-son, but for everyone, and especially for those who seem to get that your wife may actually have overcompensated for her ex's hyper-masculine traits. \n\nIt gets better, over time, if you make it better. I have the opposite scenario, where my step-kids avoid talking about me to their weekend father, because he gets visibly upset because he doesn't compare favorably to me. After 4 years of livign with me, they have become resistant to going with their father on Friday nights, and there have been a few tantrums and emotional exclamations of wishing I could be their real dad instead. \n\nIt strokes my ego a bit, but I don't let that show, and I never have anyting but positive things to say about the man. He does his best, and actually seems to care. They are lucky to have their father in their lives, in whatever capacity, and I make sure to express that to them. \n\nThat didn't happen by accident. I worked my ass off to earn that. I suspect that you can too. Whining on Reddit isn't that, unless it adjusts your attitude successfully. \n\nAgain, you signed up for a really tough job here, but it is potentially very rewarding as well. Don't teach the boy what a whiny over-sensitive man looks like. Show him a different version of what a real man looks like. It isn't about muscles and survival skills. It is every bit as much about strength of character, and willingness to sacrifice, and ability to rise above your ego to do what is right for ALL of your family. THAT is what an actual man looks like. \n\nNobody can take that away from you either. You just have to do what it takes to earn it, just like you did what it took to win over their mother.

He\u2019s also going to overcompensate for not having him around every day anymore and he\u2019s dealing with his own insecurities about that. He\u2019s trying to understand where he fits into all this. Secondly if his dad is a crappy guy this kid is going to figure it out on this own and its already going to be hard enough for him without you projecting your disdain onto him. My dad was a dick.

My mother never said a negative word about him. But guess what. When we weren\u2019t 7 anymore and built up a broader world view we figured it out. Once we started articulating the disparity he completely changed got worse and worse and we saw him less and less. In the end he died alone thousands of miles from his family and my mother passed peacefully in the loving arms of her children who revered her.

Very common for kids from divorce and not much you can do about it.

You can always also ask what he'd like to do and spend one day a week with him doing things he likes that he doesn't get to do. Create your own relationship with him don't try to replicate his dad's, he has a dad, you can fill a different role. \n\n\nAnd have a conversation with him, apologize again for that day, and tell him he can talk about whatever he likes, but you were just hurt by the constant comparison and like my fellow redditor said tell the issue is the constant comparing because it's generally not a nice thing,like he wouldn't like it if you compared him to another kid, and that ofc you love hear about all his adventures and you don't want him to filter around you", "My thought here is that the bio-dad is putting toxic masculinity thoughts into a child's head.", "It\u2019s definitely going to get worse as he gets older if someone doesn\u2019t get him to stop.

This fire was a missed opportunity: you could have let him show you how to do it, then try it together, then maybe you watch a YouTube together, try once more, and it works, and you two have bonded.\n\nBut the reason why you couldn't do it is probably because you are also comparing yourself with him, and are trying to beat him at his stuff - wich obviously won't work. This is not the way to bond with the kid. But this is also not why your wife loves you: you have qualities that he lacks. For one, you spend more time with family. You are willing to try stuff you never did before. And you are not abusive - dam, that bar is low - but I guess you might also usually be gentle and understanding.

You can add historical facts, andthe two of you can talk endlessly... and then you can become the cool step-dad who knows everything about every time on this earth! This works perfect now till about 9,10 years. Than it is time for Harry Potter. There are lot of great stories out there where the main character is an interested kid...

The kind, understanding, supportive, *solid,* **dependable,** caring man that will *always* be there.

I agree with your comments in total. \nOnly thing I would add is OP needs to find a way to be comfortable in self, a seven yr old shouldn't be able to shake your confidence so hard, maybe talk to someone about how you feel outside the family unit.

He may even be talking about his dad so much BECAUSE he can tell the dad doesn\u2019t want to see him as much. I knew a little whose father was the definition of dead beat. This little boy had a HUGE family and community of people who loved him. But he loved his father more than anything in the world. He idolized the man. This little boy was born with some serious illnesses and physical defects. He spent a lot of his childhood in the hospital. His father would promise again and again to come see him. He never did. It took him a long time to finally see his father for what he was.", "The fact that he doesn't know how to build a fire but chose camping as the family activity seems to me as evidence of that.

Context matters.", "Yeah, OP would be TA if he had a pattern of telling the kid to shut up about his dad. The way it's presented here, that's not the case.

My father was an amazing father, not the best husband. It took really good coparenting based on the mutual respect they had, for me to not ever feel it had to do with me. Or resent anyone. The entire thing amongst my parents was just how it was in my mind, it sucked FOR THEM, I saw the aftermath which I understood with time and age. Never bothered me or became about me really. Your stepson doesn\u2019t need to sense an iota of the pains his father caused as a husband, or his weaknesses as a father. Not from you, he will see what he sees and process it how he does. That\u2019s not for you to taint, or bring into the way you relate with your stepson. \n\nHe does need to see you as an individual of your own and get to know you and your strengths. It\u2019s ok to tell him \u2018ya, you can compare me to your dad all day kid but let me assure you this isn\u2019t the area of life I\u2019d compete with him on.\u2019 Learn how to be good natured about the differences, maybe acknowledge it. **Affirming his fathers strengths *and* being comfortable in who you are would be my best advice.** Similarly, involve stepson in stuff you two can do together so he\u2019s able to separate any associations, just know you. Establish a stepdad bond etc. so he can see how both coexists without comparison. \n\nYou don\u2019t just need to apologize for how you spoke to him, but how you approached it overall. Why can\u2019t you celebrate his Dad\u2019s strengths with him?? You said yourself the kid has little to hold on to with the man, so why sh*t on a 16yo only slice of real fatherly love he can think of and celebrate. It\u2019s absolutely AH of you to discourage him sharing those few joys he does get from the man!\n\nBtw I have a son without an involved father (at all), I and my family flow with my kid\u2019s feelings (not our opinions of his father). They\u2019re in touch now, when my son is gleeful - we are too. When he\u2019s nonchalant, we are too. That\u2019s all. We are just there for him, no judgment, no rehashing any bad history (most is sadly). As a family whose seen separation/divorce, my siblings and mother immediately told me \u2018bygones are bygones, we are glad he got his dad even a bit\u2019 and they made comments on how hard it must be for me. Really it\u2019s not, I\u2019m just glad my kid has more love (even if a little for now). This one is your insecurities, and absolutely unnecessary and unpaternal. Imho absolutely remove any doubt in this kid\u2019s mind that he should EVER need to hide his enthusiasm for anyone. He deserves every bit of joy.\n\nComparing people is not right in any context like this - friends, family etc. And that can be taught separately. Not by censoring him!!!!\n\nI read on another comment in another thread yesterday, \u2018talk about others successes, and your own failings\u2019. That applies to you in a way, act on it anyway (you didn\u2019t talk badly of his father, just acted on your issues and insecurities about the man by censoring his kid).", "Yeah also because OP thinks the 7 year old shouldn't love his own dad (as much) because he hurt mum... that is NOT how kids feelings work. Compassion would be better than adding to the hurt with \"don't talk about him\".", "Love you too, internet stranger. Love you too lol", "It sounds like he was trying to do something the kid enjoys.

This will require more work on her part.\n\nI\u2019m baffled as to why she would be seeking to increase his custody time. That\u2019s not an act of selflessness, being the bigger person and letting your child have a better relationship with his father than she does. That is an act of denial about the *harm* being done to that child, since her abusive ex is using that custody time to make the child more like himself. SIL\u2019s comment suggests that wife was raised in an environment where gender roles are considered more important and than her or her kids\u2019 physical safety or emotional well-being. I do not want to be judgmental of someone who escaped an abusive marriage and still has to deal with her abuser, but I think she will have to do a lot of therapeutic work if she wants to be the parent her child will need. \n\nOP is TA not only for losing it at a child manipulated by an abuser, but for centering his own wounded pride over the actual much bigger problem of the degree of emotional control an abuser is still exerting on his wife and stepson.

(You have to be the bigger person EVEN if the dad doesn't deserve it)\n\nThe more you try to restrict or push away the idea of his dad, the more the kid will double down on thinking of him as his hero, and you as the person trying to keep them apart. Don't do it.\n\nKeep being a good husband to your wife and try as much as possible to be there for your stepson and ignore any idea of competition. Ultimately his dad will let him down and he'll need both of you to be there for him instead of you being stuck in a weird competitive mindset.", "Soft YTA. If the dad is that much of an AH, your son will figure it out on his own soon enough. He\u2019s probably struggling with his lack of interactions with his father and latching onto what little he gets. \n\nWhy not use these moments as teaching opportunities? \u201cYou can be a man and have different skillsets. Sure, some men build fires, and some are carpenters, and some are teachers, and some do ballet. Manhood is not defined by the activities you do. Insulting people is not nice and makes them feel bad. Part of being a good man is understanding that humans are all different and all deserve basic respect and kindness.\u201d", "YTA your stepson is having trouble bonding with you and making him feel like he has to hide a certain part of his life from you or in your house is not going to help. I do not like my ex at all and even so I\u2019ve always made sure my daughter feels comfortable enough to share whatever she wants to share about her time with her dad. Perhaps he doesn\u2019t like you because he knows you don\u2019t like his dad.", "Very similar situation here, so I feel your pain, but gentle YTA\n\nIt\u2019s critical that kids be able to talk about the other parent, because they are working out still how that parent fits into their own identity.\n\nWhen you reject the other parent overtly, you\u2019re rejecting them. Though unintended, it\u2019s also a form of emotional abuse to train them to avoid basically setting you off by mentioning certain topics.\n\nThat said, I really get how you feel. It\u2019s really hard when the kid can\u2019t see what a taking dickhole your partner\u2019s ex is and idolizes them.\n\nA couple of thoughts:\n\n- I would apologize, say you can always talk about your dad anytime. Your dad is an important part of you are, and I LOVE you, so I have no problem when you talk about your dad. BUT - it\u2019s really mean to say things like \u201chow are you a man?\u201d And it\u2019s generally considered mean to compare people to others all the time. I know I\u2019m a grown up, but I get my feelings hurt too, so can you stop that please?\n\n-I would consider that the 7 year old likely doesn\u2019t have a perfect view of their father, and may have some unconscious idea of his poor qualities. He probably is trying to convince himself (again, unconsciously) of how great his dad is and is processing that out loud to you, a safe person.\n\n-you are a source of stability and security in his life. His dad is a source of adventure. Sucks for you, but for a kid that feels really exciting (at least for a time\u2014 it\u2019s going to wear eventually)\n\n-Kids have no filter as you know and say really unhelpful and hurtful shit that you and I have learned to keep in our heads. It\u2019s exhausting. \n\n- I would focus on finding aptitudes and interests of yours that his dad doesn\u2019t do at all, and start to introduce those things. Maybe something more intellectual like a puzzle. Maybe you start teaching him how to cook. Find a book or movie series you know hasn\u2019t been touched yet, and get going on it. Find something he is excited to share with you and doesn\u2019t have a comparison point on. \n\n-if your ex is open to it and it can be handled non-contentiously, suggest a weeknight dinners once or twice a week. Supporting NORMAL interactions that aren\u2019t exotic can be helpful for kids who have turned their non custodial parent into a fantasy in their heads\n\nReally sorry this is happening. It\u2019s really maddening when it happens.", "YTA you sound jelaous, he can be a wanky husband but a good dad, and ngl, he sounds like a pretty good dad.", "YTA\u2026he\u2019s SEVEN, you cannot expect him to understand all these adult problems between you, your wife, and his father. The comment about how are you a man is likely some misogynistic crap he heard from his dad. I doubt he understands fully what he was saying. That would have been a great opportunity to talk to him about societal gender expectations and that it\u2019s ok for men to do things that aren\u2019t \u201cmanly\u201d and that people have different skills. Telling a 7 year old not to talk about his dad around you makes you look insecure AF and I guarantee you he told his dad. Also calling him a \u201cdaddy\u2019s boy\u201d dude, eww. Do better.", "YTA. \n  \nHe's 7, he isn't coming up with that stuff out of nowhere. He's clearly being fed that information from his dad, and he's just parroting it because he's 7. It seems pretty clear that your wife's ex is trying to manipulate her son into thinking you're not as good as he is (especially considering how he treated your wife when they were together). That is also clearly not the child's fault. \n\nI understand how it would be incredibly hurtful to hear shit like that constantly, but the correct approach isn't asking him to not talk about his dad, it's to redirect and the misogynistic behavior/language and show him through words and actions that being a \"man\" has nothing to do with being a beefy caveman, but moreso about the strength of your heart etc. Be gentle with him, and take this as an opportunity to teach him to be a better man than his father. His father is pushing the toxic masculinity crap at him aggressively at a very early age, and if this isn't squashed early on then he could easily turn into one of those idiots who worships Andrew Tate and his ilk.", "YTA\nThat's his dad! He's 7. He loves his dad. I get that you are annoyed, but he's a child. You are an adult. You are responsible for controlling your emotions and actions.", "YTA.  He is seven.  Everything you said are creations within your own mind.  You yelled at a 7 year old with divorced parents to stop talking about his dad.   between shuffling from house to house he probably doesn\u2019t have much time for friends.   His dad spends time with him.  You feel self conscious.  \n\nSorry if her ex  intimidates you and is more manly.  Grow up.", "YTA  \n\n\nFor both snapping and saying not to talk about his dad - though I understood what you probably MEANT - a kid sonly heard what you SAID. You definitely should take this as an opportunity to give him a different viewpoint to the toxic masculinity he's obviously been raised to admire. \n\nAlthough it sounds like no one raises kids like Gaston.", "YTA.. stay in your lane. That is his dad and he is allowed to talk about him and admire him however he wants like a kid does. It\u2019s one thing if this was a teenager who was purposefully trying to hurt you but he is just an innocent kid that looks up to his dad and is probably sad his parents are no longer together.", "Also, don\u2019t try to compete with his dad. Stay on your home field, do stuff you like and are good at, try to engage with him in those things. \n\nI\u2019m a stepdad to a now young man, came into his life when he was 9. His dad and I are very different, and I\u2019ve never talked negatively about him to his son, despite knowing how much of an asshole he could be to my wife (not abuse-level, just not very nice).\nInstead I\u2019ve encouraged him to talk to his dad about the things he knows better than me, while staying in my lane and doing my things.\n\nI feel I\u2019ve left a positive imprint on him and we\u2019ve shared experiences he wouldn\u2019t have had with his dad, and although it\u2019s not been easy all the time we have a great relationship today.", "Exactly this! I am a stepmom myself and he is also 7. I don\u2019t mind him talking about his mother and stepfather. They are a big part of his life. So it would be weird if he didn\u2019t feel comfortable talking about them with us. We also always ask him if he did do anything fun with them so he feels free to talk. He sometimes compares our household to that of his mom and stepfather (they do \u2026 differently). I always explain to him adults will do things a bit different than other adults and that is okay. He knows the rules in our house and he knows the rules in their house. They might not always be the same but all rules are okay and he needs to follow the rules of that home. And it is okay if he forgets sometimes (he is still a kid). \n\nOP, You should allow children to talk about their parents. Otherwise you will alienate him from you, because both of his parents are important to him. Just explain to him he shouldn\u2019t compare because people will do things differently and that is alright. There is not always one right or one wrong thing to do.", "He definitely needs to get a consistent approach with his wife, too, before another situation pops up. That\u2019s her kid, they need to be on the same page for something as fraught as dealing with a toxic bio dad.", "If the bio dad wasn\u2019t abusive it sounds like step daddy is real downgrade. I mean it\u2019s honestly super embarrassing that a grown man needs a YouTube video to start a fire.", "It is not misogyny to think there are certain life skills a man should know. I mean the kid is wrong here, but that\u2019s not a slight against women.", "This exactly. I work as a social worker, right now in an asylum camp for minors. I ALWAYS play stupid and ask people to help me with x and y. It makes people feel proud to be able to help others and do it well and it creates a good bonding experience for us.\nNext time your stepson says \"my father can do this\", then say, \"oh really, how great, I can't do that. Did he teach you? Can you show me and teach me?\". He will feel proud and you have a bonding opportunity.  Humans are that easy!", "This was a great comment until the judgmental bomb launched at OP at the end. Different kids are different, and it actually doesn\u2019t matter how long you parent, you still get your feelings hurt by them. You never stop being a human being. And you still have to do the right thing. But there\u2019s nothing surprising about getting your feelings hurt by a 7 year old.", "I saw my dad for a few hours a month growing up, and I absolutely thought he was great, well until I was like 8 or 9 and he kicked me out of his car and drove away leaving me blocks away from home but that's besides the point, shit even that didn't fully end it.\n\nMy step daughter still idolizes her dad. I vividly remember her 5th birthday. Was one of those princess dress up parties ect. My wife (girlfriend at the time) paid for the venue and I paid for all the food and the cake, her dad contributed nothing and showed up high. She asked for a family picture, and by that she ment my wife and her bio dad. I didn't say nothing because I'm an adult, but that shit fuckin hurt. I was the one who read to her at night, I was the one who walked her to school and picked her up, I took her to dance and soccer and went to her games not him. My wife's best friend must have seen how I felt on my face and she made sure to suggest a picture with me and my son and my step daughter and wife.\n\nOPs step son will realize eventually who is actually there for him and who is the real parent. And the hardest fuckin thing to do as a step parent is to keep doing all the right things, while waiting for the kid to come to that realization. That imo is the mark of a great step parent, being able to do the work of parenting and giving the love of a parent without immediately getting the love back from the kid.", "I use this all the time , love that quote", "I don't know. The kid might be on the money with their judgement of OP.", "Haha I say stuff like this a lot, but the other way around. Like, \u201coh yes, Woman are naturally better at housecleaning.

Especially when he gets to be the fun weekend parent. I speak from experience. Im sure I hurt my mom a lot when I was still a daddy's girl, and before I really understood what happened. But she's the adult. Just like OP and his wife. It's their job to keep adult things between the adults and not bring the kids into it. Even if Dad seems not to be doing too great a job of that, you teach that those behaviors aren't ok for you to do and as they get older bring things into age appropriate conversation. Slowly. Staying neutral will pay off eventually. It did with me, at least.", "Starting a fire is an acquired skill that a lot of humans don't even need most of the time.", "Really? Because I feel like it\u2019s pretty much exclusively used for actually harmful behavior like misogyny, homophobia, repressing emotions, justifying violence, stuff like that.", "And for extra fun, OP's reaction can also be attributed to toxic masculinity/patriarchy. Men are expected to show very little emotion. We are largely relegated to either being happy or mad. When looking at the situation from outside it's pretty obvious that OP is jealous, sad, hurt, frustrated.... But men largely don't get to safely explore those emotions other than through lashing out angrily.", "Thanks! I wasn\u2019t sure and never checked deeply.", "Omg! I didn\u2019t check back and just sorta assumed it\u2019s the teen. Absolutely disgusting \ud83d\ude2d kids that age can\u2019t even be expected to be showing anything but enthusiasm. Poor kiddo", "Oof, I read that as 17, not 7. The age really makes OP the AH.", "Yep. A 17 year old telling someone they're not a real man is probably an arsehole. A 7 year old saying it is just parroting what he's heard and needs guidance, not anger.", "That's a different thing. We're specifically talking about how you need X to be a man or woman. That is literally shaming others on the basis of self-imposed gendernorms, which is really bad.\n\nYou're not less of a man if you don't know how to change oil, like beer or anything like that. I'd maybe call someone dumb if they don't know how to cook.

That's awesome because I've never been camping before. Can you show me how you do it?\"\n\nIf he was a teenager I'd say he's doing it to piss you off but he's a child. He thinks you're \"replacement dad\" and he's talking to you the only way he knows how. NEVER tell him to not talk about his dad, I promise you he'll grow up hating you for it. It's not nice to be compared to the real dad and I get that but again he's talking to you about his dad because in a seven year olds head you're \"other dad\" and you and his dad should be the same. He thinks everything his dad does is just \"dad things\" and you SHOULD know them. Explaining more calmly next time that all dad's do different stuff for fun and bonding time might help. \n\nI would maybe try asking him next time about stuff he's never done or would like to do. You're not gonna ever be better than his dad in his eyes even if you ARE better. It doesn't mean he doesn't love you my guy. When you're a kid with a biological dad in your life and a stepdad, stepdad takes on an uncle role. You're not going to be able to change that. It almost sounds like you compare yourself to the bio dad. I'm sure you're doing great and I'm positive you'll get the hang of being a stepdad. It's gonna be hard but you'll get there.\n\nYou don't sound like you're an asshole but in this situation right here YTA and especially in that boys eyes for at least a little while YTA . You're gonna have to jump through hoops a little bit but it'll be worth it in the end.", "This could have been a good bonding experience. You could have asked your stepson to teach you how to light the campfire. Kids love to have the chance to teach an adult something.\n\nAnd yeah, you should have worded it better.

He picked this language up from his toxic dad.", "Came here to say the same thing. He should absolutely be allowed to talk about his Dad. That's his special person that only he gets to see, and he's only going to see the good things. Of course he's going to talk about how much fun his Dad is. \n\nThe way the son was comparing you and saying \"how can you be a man etc\" is inappropriate and definitely should be addressed. He may not realize what he is saying is hurtful to you. \n\nGood job by your wife for not trash mouthing her ex husband too, that takes such a strong person to do that. \n\nYTA for saying he can't talk about a person who is very important to him.", "Sure, that is something to be addressed, but he is 7, that was clearly not on the kid and as the adult in the situation OP should recognize that.", "He's 7, calm down. Y'all obviously don't have kids.", "That little kid would've been over the moon if Stepdad had said, \"Hey kiddo, why don't you teach us how to start the fire, and I'll be your helper? Let's go gather the wood and you can show me how to stack it.\" Bond with the kid over gathering, setting it up, lighting the kindling, all that good stuff. \n\nIf he said anything like \"How are you a man if you can't start a fire?\" OP can pull from his own interests. \"Well, buddy, I can't start a fire, but I can draw an owl. Want to see?\" or \"play the guitar\" or \"kick butt at MarioKart\" or whatever OP is good at. There are so many different ways of bonding with a child, and redirecting is the magic that opens the door for it.", "Which is BS, in my view withholding information like that from kids is the same as lying. We do not give kids enough credit, they can handle the truth. The son probably blames the mom and step dad for not getting to see his bio dad often and has no idea the underlying reasons why. He is blaming the wrong people and insulting the man who is proving for his upbringing in the process. He needs to know the truth and who the \u201cbad guy\u201d actually is, otherwise this misplaced blame and resentment ends up creating messes like the situation described, and the guilty party, bio-dad, gets none of the consequences. I always tell my kids the truth, and each time I look back and realize I was lied to about something as a kid it just fills me with anger that my parents thought so low of me I couldn\u2019t handle reality.", "\"Everyone's great at some things and less great at others.
