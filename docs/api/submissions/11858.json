I have a son (14) and a daughter (12) with my ex-wife and my wife has a son (7) with her ex-husband. We all moved in together in late 2021. My kids get along great with their stepbrother and they adore me wife. I have had a trickier time bonding with my stepson. We have my kids every other week and my stepson goes to his dads every other weekend. \n\nMy stepson is a massive daddy's boy. His dad takes him on some kind of \"adventure\" every weekend they're together. He is always talking about what he is going to do with his dad or what he and his dad did at the weekend. Which is annoying but fine. However, recently he keeps comparing me to his dad. Saying things his dad would do differently or telling me his dad can do something so I should be able to too. \n\nLast weekend we went camping, which is something we've not really done before as a family. When it came to building a campfire my stepson started complaining I was doing it wrong (I was following a YouTube tutorial) and tried to interfer with what I was doing. Then he said \"how are you a man but don't even know how to make a fire\" before going on to talk about how his dad could light a fire with a stick. I was already stressed about the whole weekend and I ended up snapping at him and telling to shut up about his dad. \n\nObviously, I was in the wrong for snapping. After finishing the fire I went to apologies to him and let him know I was in the wrong for talking to him like that. I did however, reaffirm that I would like it if he stopped talking about his dad so much. \n\nLater in the week he must of said something to my wife about not being allowed to mention his dad. She is now mad at me for having this discussion with him even though I know she finds it annoying as well. In truth I have always felt self conscious about my wife's ex-husband as he is very stereotypically masculine guy (ex-marine) and I'm the opposite. My wife's sister called me an \"over correction\" to my face a few months into dating. It's also frustrating to see how much my stepson idolises his dad when he doesn't know how much his dad hurt his mom. He cheated on her, was abusive, and continued to financially abuse her post separation. His dad has refused to have any more custody time with his son and even when we went on our honeymoon last year he sent his son to his moms rather than look after him himself. I know how much it hurts my wife to see her son favor his dad when he does the bare minimum as a father and damaged her so badly. AITA for suggesting he stops talking about his dad so much?", "created_utc": 1678367603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mrv2i/aita_for_telling_my_stepson_to_stop_talking_about/", "score": 381, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is 7 and is dealing with the divorce and a new family but he is 7.  Get over any feelings of inferiority and jealousy.  You should be encouraging him to have a good relationship with his dad.  Even if he was awful to your wife, your step son needs to have his own separate relationship with him.  When he is older and is emotionally mature enough you can broach those subjects with him.\n\nIn the present, you may want to focus on showing him there are different ways to do things.  Explain that your father can have his way of living and you do things differently.  Neither way is better than the other, but they work for each of you.  Masculinity cannot be defined with only one example.  Show him why you are the way you are and provide a role model that you can be proud of.\n\nGood luck!", "YTA. The kid is 7 - *of course* he doesn\u2019t have a deep understanding of the intricacies of his parents relationship and *of course* he idolizes and talks about his father. He\u2019s one of two of the most important people in his life. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re taking out your own insecurities on this kid. Just stop. If you think you\u2019re a better example of how a husband and father should act, then actually step up and show that to him instead of this petty BS.", "[deleted]", "\"Obviously, I was in the wrong for snapping.\"  YTA, big time, and **you already know it**.  How would you like your ex-wife's new man to say the same thing to your kids about you?!", "This is the whole wrong way to go about this and you're feeling way too personally threatened. You've made this about your ego, not about the kid. \n\nHe's seven, he's supposed to idolise his dad, not know how much his dad hurt his mom and he's definitely not supposed to hear that he shouldn't talk about his dad. Young children frequently favour the less stable parent (his dad) because they feel secure enough in their relationship with the stable parent (his mom) that they don't constantly need to express affection. \n\nInstead of making this into a you vs him issue, let your stepson talk about his dad. Include him in conversations. If the kid says that his dad can do it better, ask the kid to help you because maybe he already picked up a trick you don't know. Stop trying to compete and just focus on your own relationship with the kid.", "YTA - For gods sake, hes SEVEN YEARS OLD. Take your insecurities and sort yourself out.", "YTA. You are emotionally damaging a young child.", "ESH except for the kid. He is 7, he obviously gets a pass. His adoration for his father is natural and should be encouraged. But whatever sick mind games the father might be playing through the little kid should stop.\n\nThe biological father is an AH for sure, he is telling the kid things with obvious intent to harm the mother's current relationship.\n\nThe OP clearly overreacted and he knows it, he seems to be insecure about his relationship. He needs to realize his wife chose him because she doesn't think a man needs to be a macho, which is the truth.\n\nMother needs to find a way to make sure the boy does not make hurtful comments and probably talk to kid's father about the way he is teaching him to talk.", "Soft YTA. It sounds like your stepsons dad isn\u2019t teaching him good things (I can only assume he got that \u201chow are you a man..\u201d crap from his dad), but this is not the sort of thing you can force out of him. You\u2019re going to have to be gentle and patient. Ask him nicely not to compare you to his father. Be firm but fair about how things like that hurt your feelings and hurting others feelings is unkind. It\u2019s absolutely reasonable to not want him to make rude comments comparing you to his dad, but you\u2019ve got to handle it as an adult teaching a child.", "YTA. He's 7 how insecure are you. Doesn't matter what you think of his dad. In his eyes it doesn't matter what his dad has done. Later in life he'll figure things out. But what you're trying to do now. Will bite you when he's older.", "Soft YTA\n\nI get why this is frustrating and annoying and why you have feelings of resentment about the rugged dude type stuff compared to this guy even though logically your brain knows the ex was abusive and treated your wife awful an isn't really all that great to his kid considering he only wants the bare minimum time with his son.\n\nBut *the kid is seven*. You are an adult. Of course he idolizes his dad. Of course he's talking about his dad because he misses his dad. His dad is barely in his life (like 4 days a month) and talking about him when he's not there is probably his way of trying to keep him present somehow. \n\nSo I think your job as the adult is to change the subject. Not by saying \"don't talk about your dad\" but by redirecting. \"Hey, Stepson, help me start this fire.\" Give him stuff to do. Get him engaged with you. You won't ever replace his dad and that's okay. You can still be a great, super positive force in his life and over time as he gets older and more socially aware, this behavior will probably naturally decrease on its own.", "I'd narrow it a little more specifically, \"It's not nice to compare people. Everyone is different and has different abilities\"\n\nHe is young and may be parroting things his father says, especially if he was as abusive as indicated. He's trying to use his son to drive a wedge between you and your wife. That is something she needs to deal with, by talking to the son.\n\nI don't think anyone here is an asshole, just trying to navigate blending a family.\n\nNAH", "Yeah man, YTA. You said so yourself that you're self-conscious about your wife's ex. You list all the bad things he did to her, but that doesn't impact your relationship with her at all. Either you believe she's with you because she loves you and recognizes value in who you are, or you shouldn't be together.\n\nIn terms of the 7 year old child in this scenario, you're out of your mind. Of course he's going to idolize his big strong dad who only ever takes him when it's a fun adventure. He isn't a parent, he's a camp counselor. So take a deep breathe. Your stepson, unless he is an absolute idiot, will eventually see that you're a man in his life he can count on, and his dad is just a fun guy who bounces whenever he wants. In that time, your stepson will come to rely on you, trust you, love you, and value the relationship you have. But that can only happen if you don't act jealous of the deadbeat who fathered him. \n\nHe says you're building the fire wrong? Ask him how to do it right.", "YTA. But only for the way you went about the whole thing. If you had sat him down and had a calm conversation with him and even included your wife in the discussion it may have gone over better. Kids are smarter than people think and at seven he should be able to understand this on at least the lowest level. \n\nIt does sound to me like there are some underlying feelings on both sides and you could both benefit from some structured therapy.", "YTA. Youre jealous of another man and took it out on a child. Get a grip.", "YTA.  You are talking about a young child who had been through tremendous upheaval that he has had precisely zero control over.  He probably already feels very torn with divided loyalties to each of his parents, which you just made even worse for him by demanding that he not talk about his father around you.\n\nYou are the adult here, and he is the child.  It is entirely inappropriate to make him responsible for catering to your emotional needs and insecurities.", "What you should have said was \"please stop **comparing** me to your dad. I am so happy you have such a great relationship with him, but we are differnt people and have different ways of doing things. I try not to compare you to my son becuase you are different people. Do you understand?\"\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nAs the parent of a kid who idolises their dad and forgives them for everything, you need to deal with this in a different way.\n\nIf the kid says \"what kind of man doesn't know how to build a fire?\" Answer it somehow that is positive-ish. Maybe: A man that didn't grow up as lucky as him that had a dad and a stepdad that took him camping. Can you teach me? Bond with him another way. Show him that 'a man' can be many things. Someone who can build fires and chop wood and can paint toenails and vacume the floor. \n\nYes, you are going to hear a lot of 'my dad's the best' through the years, but up to the point it's hurtful or rude towards you, just go along with it. Tell him how lucky he is to have such an amazing dad. If it's rude, say/deal with that without making it about dad. \n\nIt sucks to have to smile and listen to how amazing the $#^#&\u00d7 arseh@#$ you know is and how they are the best. But they are the kids father and will be there for the forseeable future. Not playing into this pissing contest is going to help in the long term.\n\nBreathing exercises help \ud83d\ude0f", "YTA", "NTA. You should separate the kid from the dad completely though. It looks like he is learning wrong traits from the bio dad and I am 100% sure, the biodad talks shit about you. If he loves his bio dad so much, he can go live with him full time.", "YTA! \n\nBasically you're DEEPLY insecure of the man that created the son with your now wife, that's just something you will have to get Cover and love with! Glad your wife told you off!!!", "YTA  \nThe ex may have been an utterly terrible husband, but it sounds like he's a good dad to his son. Or the son thinks he's a great dad.   \nThe kid isn't talking about his dad to wind you up. He's talking about his dad because his dad is important to him and that's what kids talk about. (See also: pokemon, how delicious spaghetti is, how itchy a sock is and the 3 hour story about a cat that their friend owns)", "YTA This kid is still getting used to another man being in his life.  Of course there's going to be comparisons made. You as the adult have handled it all wrong.  Instead of shouting \"shut up don't talk about your dad\" you should've explained that \" its great your dad can do this but often times in life there's many different ways to do something and just because someone does something a different way doesn't mean its wrong. I'd like to try to do it this way but if it doesn't work then you can tell me how your dad does it and we'll give that a try\" then after maybe have a sit down and explain to him that \" me and your dad are different people we're not going to do everything the same way and I understand that that can be confusing for you. I love you and your mother very much and we all need to learn how to work together.\" Just realise you've suddenly come into the life of a 7 year old child thats a big thing for him. Its your job as the adult to try and understand him and yelling and forcing him to not talk bout his dad its not the way to do it.", "YTA for telling him to not talk about his dad. You were right to apologize for snapping but the discussion should have been about not being rude. Your stepson should be allowed to talk about his dad, he's his dad! If your stepson feels he can't talk about his dad he's going to resent the time he's with you. In his mind it's the evil stepdad who won't let him talk about his real dad. \n\nHe doesn't need to insult you to talk about his dad. That's what you should have focused on.", "YTA.\n\nIt doesn't matter if his dad was an abusive asshole, is a bad father, or if being compared to some hyper-masculine jarhead hurts your feelings. He's 7. None of that is his business or his responsibility.\n\nYou're the adult. Suck it up. He'll learn the truth about his father eventually. That's  inevitable. You should strive to be the man he can come to for guidance when that happens, not the one responsible for it.", "YTA\n\nHe's 7, he won't understand what his father did to his mother and the reasoning for divorce. Your anger at the ex husband is for every correct reason, but the kid won't understand it. Let your wife explain it him when he's older.\n\nFile for child support and days for custody, he's going to throw the kid at you and your wife out of jealousy at the important days of your marriage.\n\nTry and get him Jail time for what he did to your wife. I do feeling have that he's going to negatively influence the kid.", "Bro YTA\u2026 have you tried\u2026 correcting his behavior instead of snapping? He\u2019s old enough to understand the words \u201chey buddy! I know your dad is super cool and you love him, but it\u2019s really mean to compare two people together. It\u2019s starting to make me feel not good. You can talk about him still, but please stop making comparisons between us\u201d \n\nThe way you snapped at him, is probably making him feel like he is punished for having a cool dad, Which is wrong. You guys need to correct the behavior, not snap and make him feel bad", "YTA\n\nIt's not your place to talk like that to your wife's son. She's the parent and you need to butt out and suck it up.  Apologise to your stepson for being out of line about his dad and ask him to show you how to light a fire.\n\nYour relationship with your stepson is very tenuous.and it's not a good idea to judge and compare with the relationship your wife has with your own kids. He's allowed to idolise his dad and he should quite rightly not have any idea of the toxic relationship between his parents. \n\nAre you trying to be a second dad when the boy needs a friend or an uncle?", "yta. the child is 7 right now his hero is his dad. give it time his dad will do something to change the boys thinking be there to pick up the pieces when his world is shattered. stop being jealous you got the girl and in the 3nd you'll get the boy too just give it time without pressuring him.", "YTA. He's a kid! You need to grow up. If you're a better man be the better man because eventually the rose tinted glasses will fall off and when it inevitably does, you would have established a genuine relationship. He has a dad, don't try to be that. Just find your place in the life. You have no clue what the dad is saying to him and how he's feeling.", "YTA for telling him to talk about his dad less point blank.\n\nYTA for thinking that his dad\u2019s shitty behaviour is something that the child should be taking into account without knowing about it, or that it should be added into this right now - that\u2019s a delicate thing that needs a big strategy and deep conversations between you and your wife before you approach it because as right as it sounds like you are, trying to \u201cdamage\u201d his image of his dad is going to backfire on you guys first imo.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA for sounding to me like a much better father figure general though. Sounds like this is hard for you and being TA for snapping is something I can see as \u201cnobody\u2019s perfect\u201d even if an AH move at the time. But you apologised for that part. \n\nWhat you need to do is have a talk with your stepson that is absolutely NOT about talking about his dad less, but explaining that you\u2019re a different person who doesn\u2019t want to be negatively compared because that hurts you and you\u2019re not trying to be him. Not because you don\u2019t want to hear about his dad. Yeah there are things you\u2019re not good at - like building a fire - but you have plenty of different skills too, just like every person. And that those skills are really valuable too. People are different. You\u2019re different to his dad and also have a different relationship to him than his dad does. You don\u2019t want to replace him. Offer to meet in the middle with you not saying you don\u2019t want him to talk about his dad, but ask if he can respect there\u2019s no need for comparisons or being rude\u2026 you get my vibe.", "Soft YTA\n\nHe's 7. He will one day perhaps see or learn that his dad was not the best. There's no need to do that now. He probably idolizes him bc he misses him - and bc it does sound like he makes a real effort when he has him.\n\nYou were wrong to snap but mainly you were wrong to let a 7 yr old get under your skin when it's obvious he's just a parrot. His dad obv talks a lot about what a \"real man\" does or is.... and guess what, that is likely something his own dad did and the military definitely did and has NOTHING to do with you.\n\nYou can def sort out the comparisons by starting to compare HIM to other kids and say - is that fair or necessary? Why can't we be really excited that someone else is good at different things than us? Absolutely fair to address that but realize that he's a kid and maybe his dad IS awesome with him even if he sucks in plenty of other ways.", "YTA\n\nHe is just a child. You can't expect him to understand how it might make you feel when he brings up his father. On the other hand you're the adult, so maybe behave like one. \nI am not trying to be mean but if you feel threatened or belittled or I don't know what when he talks about his dad maybe you should try to work out why you feel that way.", "YTA. He's 7. Trying to process his broken family, a new family, and all the emotions of going back and forth between two households. You're the adult and you've dumped your insecurities onto him.", "YTA, he's going to idolise his dad till he figures it out on his own. Telling him to stop talking about his dad just makes you sound insecure and jealous. Just be like it's awesome your dad can do that, but everyone's different, you know?\"", "YTA. He's seven. SEVEN. You are an adult. You have no right to tell a little boy to not feel his feelings. The poor kid misses his dad. Come on now. Put on your big boy pants and adult here.\n\n I honestly think counseling would help you, and him a lot. Your comments reek with insecurity. She chose you. Apparently she felt you were up to the challenge of helping raise her son. That includes meeting him where he is at.", "NTA - clearly could have gone about it a little different and you were smart to realize that - but in the greater scheme of things, you have to set your boundaries - I have to wonder why his mom is angry if she doesn't appreciate all the talk about him either. Also, why hasn't she said anything to him up to this point? I get that the little guy loves his dad - I wouldn't want to change that - but it's easy when you're 7 and all you have is 'good times' with him.", "A 7 year old asking his step father \u201c how are you a man\u201d is completely inappropriate.

Find your own thing to do with him that is sufficiently different that he will love. Video games perhaps?", "NAH\n\nI can see why the kid does this, and I can see why it bothers you.\n\nHonestly I don't think there's much you can/should do though.  Maybe your wife could apply some gentle correction -- but at the same time, I doubt there's much point telling the kid all about his father's faults.", "Soft YTA for how you handled it: points for apologising, but it's true you can't tell your stepson not to talk about his dad. What you should have addressed in your apology imo is what he said, the \"how can you be a man\" stuff definitely jumps out.

He is SEVEN.    \nWhatever connection he has with his father is all that he has known and of course he misses him.  Talking about him is his way of keeping that connection.  It's not time for him to make judgement's on either of his parents.  But he does have to make a judgement on whether or not you are a safe person in his life.  He's not saying what he is to deliberately hurt you.  He just needs to be heard by you and his mom.  Listen and agree with him on what you can, tell him gently that as different as you are from his dad, that you don't care any less for him then you do your own children.  And for the love of all, stop comparing yourself to the ex.  It's obvious you're not him and that should be something you are grateful for being!", "YTA. Your kid is always going to love his dad as a dad more than he is going to love you as a dad. Accept that.\n\n\nWhat you don\u2019t have to accept is that there is only one model for masculinity and that there are many different traits for a boy to admire in a man that aren\u2019t just stereotypically masculine. Instead of leaning into how you are and showing him how great you are as you (best step dad in the world), you showed him how fragile and sensitive you are because you AREN\u2019T the stereotypical manly man that your stepson currently prizes. \n\n\nYou\u2019re never likely to be his number one macho dad, but you absolutely can show him how great it is to be a man in other ways and how the world needs all types. Reframe how you look at this situation. It isn\u2019t your stepson being annoying because he loves his dad, it\u2019s you finding ways to inspire him with who you are and your actions, separately and incomparably to his dad. When he brings up how awesome his dad is, affirm that. Be bigger and braver by agreeing that things his dad does (note: not who his dad is, because he sounds like an asshole) are admirable. And then open the door to how approaching things other ways can be equally good, just different. And that it\u2019s good to have all kinds of tools in a tool box ranging from the most stereotypical to the least.", "YTA - he should be allowed to talk about his dad. What you can do is affirm with him that you are not his dad, and that you have other skills, and that being a man has nothing to do with abilities to lighting a fire. \n\nHe sees his dad 2 days out of 14. You are whether either of you like it or not the biggest male influence in his life. It also sounds like the major influence from his father is pretty toxic. So put yourself in role of that, instead of feeling inadequate to his father, remember you are not a toxic male and it is important to show this young boy what that means. Explain things to him. Talk to him. Demonstrate to him. \n\nHe will see it. And the more you\u2019re there for him. That you show up to him and his mum. That you demonstrate a healthy relationship and what positive masculinity is, the more he will learn from you and hopefully not turn out like his father.\n\nMost people start realising their parents flaws once they hit teenage years. It\u2019ll be much easier for him to grow into a good man if he has you there showing him the way.", "Don\u2019t tell him to stop talking about his dad, tell him not to COMPARE you to his dad. There is a difference.", "YTA - you are projecting your own adult insecurities and frustrations onto a child.   He's 7 and just trying to make sense out the fact that he idolizes his dad but clearly his mom and others (including you) do not.  And kids see themselves as an extension of their parents.  Trashing his dad = trashing him.", "YTA - this poor child is dealing with a broken marriage not of his making, with two parents he loves who are no longer together through no fault of his own, and this other random guy suddenly thrust into his life who is not his father but is around more than his real dad ... and very likely favors his own kids from his own broken marriage over him ... and now forbids him from talking about his father and yells at him about it. Your responses and actions are abusive and will damage him for life. Perhaps that is unavoidable, but you're not helping.\n\nAlso, \"daddy's boy\" isn't a thing, so let me help you \"he loves and looks up to his father\"", "Lmao, kid roasted you at the campfire.\n\nAlso you sound like will Ferrell in that movie with mark walhburg, daddy\u2019s home. Hilarious.", "YTA. If his dad is as bad as you claim, then your stepson will figure that out himself eventually. All you\u2019ve done by telling him to stop mentioning his dad is removed yourself as a person who he can come to for support when that happens.", "YTA You could\u2019ve asked your stepson to show you how his father builds the fire prior to lighting it. You also could\u2019ve asked him to stop unfavorably comparing you to him, rather than not talking about him at all. \n\nBe thankful that he thinks that his bio dad is great for now. You could be listening to the kid\u2019s adventures and learning what he likes, so that if his dad ends up abandoning him as a teen, you won\u2019t be a stranger to your stepson, and can be there for him. \n\nTeach him - by showing and discussion - how to be a man the way that you\u2019re a man. Hyper masculinity isn\u2019t the only way to be. Show him that there are other options. Be a safe place for him.\n\n\nPlease consider family therapy for you and your wife first; then with your stepson added, after the therapist has helped you both realize that you should be doing what you can to build a good foundation now with your child. He may really need you later on, if his father decides to be awful to him, too. (Which everyone hopes doesn\u2019t happen, of course.)", "YTA - That is his father, his hero. You need to work on getting a connection with your stepson and that is not by snapping at him or telling him to stop talking about his father.", "YTA. This does sound really frustrating from your point. But, he is a child and also dealing with a difficult situation. He doesn't have the coping skills that you have learned over your lifetime. He also doesn't understand adult relationships like you do.", "Yeah YTA.

His comments weren\u2019t okay and I don\u2019t care what age you are, you can teach your kids manners. \n\nYou should not take it out on him but talk with your wife instead and figure out a way where you can talk with him about learning to stop comparing people and that everyone is different and has different skills and ability.", "NAH.   \n\n\nI don't really understand the \"YTAs\" when there's the Tough Guy dynamic coming from the kid's dad that's really tough to deal with, especially since the kid is seven.   \n\n\nBut here's the thing, and I think you actually know this: time and experience is going to be key with the stepson, his dad, and you. He obviously idolizes his dad, but he doesn't see how little time his dad actually spends with him, and that's going to show itself when he gets older. You being there as the \"antidote\" to the dad's hyper-masculinity can show the kid that men aren't all like his dad (and that's a good thing; everyone being the same is really boring). So obviously you now know it's not reasonable to tell the kid he can't talk about his dad in front of you; it's HOW he talks about him that's the issue, so make an age-appropriate explanation for him because he's only seven.  \n\n\nYou're going to have to be patient with him, and your wife really needs to step up and shut down bullshit from the family like her sister's \"over correction\" comment because that's just rude, especially if she knows what your wife went through with Mr. Man. I hope your wife tells her son why she isn't with his dad in the appropriate ways at the appropriate times. I hope you can be more patient with the kid, and give him life lessons about comparing different people the way he's currently doing with you and his dad.   \n\n\nGood luck!", "NAH. It sounds incredibly annoying and nobody likes being compared, and he was rude, obviously hanging out with his father rubbed off on him the worst way. The only AH is his father, and your wife for not doing anything about it.", "YTA.\n\nBeyond apologizing, you need to make it clear to your stepson that he can talk about his dad all he wants, it's just that you don't want to be compared to him.\n\nLonger term, he needs to understand that there are lots of different kinds of men and women in the world.  His dad may be a \"real man\" but he was a shitty husband and now what I call a \"15% parent.\"\n\nI'm sure his dad talks about \"real men\" all the time, including himself and excluding you.  Since he idolizes his dad, you won't get anywhere by disrespecting \"real men.\"  You could actually praise what is good about his father, tell him that only one man in a thousand is a marine or ex-marine.  Simply agree whole-heartedly that his dad is better at making fire (or whatever) than you are.\n\nYou can certainly talk about what makes a \"good parent\" and how you and your wife try to be that for your kids.

I have a son (14) and a daughter (12) with my ex-wife and my wife has a son (7) with her ex-husband. We all moved in together in late 2021. My kids get along great with their stepbrother and they adore me wife. I have had a trickier time bonding with my stepson. We have my kids every other week and my stepson goes to his dads every other weekend. \n\nMy stepson is a massive daddy's boy. His dad takes him on some kind of \"adventure\" every weekend they're together. He is always talking about what he is going to do with his dad or what he and his dad did at the weekend. Which is annoying but fine. However, recently he keeps comparing me to his dad. Saying things his dad would do differently or telling me his dad can do something so I should be able to too. \n\nLast weekend we went camping, which is something we've not really done before as a family. When it came to building a campfire my stepson started complaining I was doing it wrong (I was following a YouTube tutorial) and tried to interfer with what I was doing. Then he said \"how are you a man but don't even know how to make a fire\" before going on to talk about how his dad could light a fire with a stick. I was already stressed about the whole weekend and I ended up snapping at him and telling to shut up about his dad. \n\nObviously, I was in the wrong for snapping. After finishing the fire I went to apologies to him and let him know I was in the wrong for talking to him like that. I did however, reaffirm that I would like it if he stopped talking about his dad so much. \n\nLater in the week he must of said something to my wife about not being allowed to mention his dad. She is now mad at me for having this discussion with him even though I know she finds it annoying as well. In truth I have always felt self conscious about my wife's ex-husband as he is very stereotypically masculine guy (ex-marine) and I'm the opposite. My wife's sister called me an \"over correction\" to my face a few months into dating. It's also frustrating to see how much my stepson idolises his dad when he doesn't know how much his dad hurt his mom. He cheated on her, was abusive, and continued to financially abuse her post separation. His dad has refused to have any more custody time with his son and even when we went on our honeymoon last year he sent his son to his moms rather than look after him himself. I know how much it hurts my wife to see her son favor his dad when he does the bare minimum as a father and damaged her so badly. AITA for suggesting he stops talking about his dad so much?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He's also 7...\n\nYou are an adult, and you are buying into this somehow being a competition. It doesn't have to be.\n\nYour wife probably didn't tell your son all the awful things her ex did because she doesn't want to alienate him from his father. That time will come, and it will be up to her to handle it, but right now this boy is a little too young to dump that on.\n\nInstead of leaning into your resentment, try leaning into demonstrating the benefits of NONtoxic masculinity.", "NTA", "Soft YTA.

Why not embracing who you are and teach him other stuff his dad won\u2019t or can\u2019t. At that age kids will idolize their parents and the more you go against it the more he will resent you.", "YTA. I was your son, when I was growing up. My step dad forced his way into a relationship which has definitely caused issues currently. There is nothing wrong with wanting a relationship with your stepson (I\u2019m glad you do!) but you can not wreck the one he has with his dad. He is 7, his dad is the coolest dude in his eyes right now. You may be morally better, but this kid is also going through a huge turn around in his life. \n\n\nYou\u2019re taking our your own insecurities on a 7 year old who isn\u2019t old enough to comprehend the situation. And even then, it\u2019s your stepsons choice whether or not he wants to continue that relationship. Not yours, not his moms (as long as he\u2019s paying child support and has custody obviously). \n\n\nHowever, I do think you and your wife need a talk. My mom grew to resent me after I kept favouring my dad because I never knew all the crappy things he did. I\u2019m not saying you should lay everything on the kid, again he\u2019s only 7. So you also need to keep that in mind.", "YTA\n\nBUT,\n\nI think his dad is feeding him some of that information. Kid has no understanding on how to process the information and make judgement. I have a strong feeling that his dad is trying to alienate him by doing \"adventures\" every time the child visits him, and by highlighting how much more of a \"man\" he is compared to you.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I had a friend whose parents were getting divorced. They were already separated but the dad kept dragging the divorce in court. He would give my friend anything and everything he asked for, then would highlight how his mom was not able to buy him cool gadgets/trips/expensive clothes. When his mom started dating someone else the dad got way worse, to the point my friend thought his mom was a bad parent (she wasn't, she just was financially drained by the divorce). His mom got engaged, then the dad moved to Florida and wanted custody of my friend. My friend was ecstatic! He visited his dad right after the wedding, and was promised a trip to Disney! Once he is in Florida, and they are driving to Disney, dad call his mom and tells that my friend wanted to live permanently in Florida. His mom said: Thats fine with me! Right there his dad turned around and went back. A week later my friend was back with his mom. Guy got no Disney trip, and his dad disappeared for a couple of years.", "YTA. Look  he's 7, his dad, no matter how much of an abusive ahole he is, is still his father and will continue to favor him whether you like it or not. You just have to deal with it and find ways of dealing with it, not lash out at the kid for choosing to idolize his dad over you. I'm pretty sure your wife is aware and it hurts her immensely but she has to put those feelings aside so the kid can have somewhat stability coparenting. I suggest you follow her lead. Maybe one day the kid will realize how much of a prick his dad is when he gets older.\n\nAs for bonding with him, dude it takes time, so don't force it or you'll end up the topic of a reddit post in the future.", "YTA. He\u2019s 7. You don\u2019t get to dictate to him how he processes what has happened in his young life. Next time say \u201cyes, your dad can do it, but I can\u2019t.

He lets him eat as much sugar as he wants and he never has a bed time at his house. Yep, I can see why he was getting frustrated with his mother who wanted him to sometimes eat a vegetable and also not fall asleep in school. But my nephew loved his dad, and also wished he was better, and felt this need to preemptively defend him against his very accurate failings that at 6 my nephew already felt but couldn't articulate. \n\nThis behavior stopped after a year or two as my nephew came to terms with just how disappointing his dad was. \n\nWas it frustrating listening to my nephew talk about how great his absolutely crap father was and blame his mother for him not getting more time with him when his dad moved across the state and frequently flaked on picking him up? Yep. Would going off on a 6yo help that situation? Nope.

I agree that there should be boundaries, but those are for OP and his wife to determine, and honestly, what their relationship looks like should be is a tone that should be based on how the 7 yo feels. Children deserve to have good relationships with both bio parents, so supporting his love for his father is imperative, but that does not preclude the ability for OP to have a good relationship with him too.

I can't even imagine how lonely and hurt and afraid this 7 year old is and you think it's about you.

Sort this out before you traumatize the poor kid more!", "Yta but it is not too late to redo this and make it right again! He is seven years old, he probably notices that his dad chooses to not spend as much time with him as he could and if not he will notice very soon. He sees daily how his mom and you.do the everyday things with him and his siblings, even though you probably work and have a lot of other things happening every day. How come his dad can't do that? My kids started to notice that sort of things around i years old about adults around them, seeing through their bullsh*t. This will only get worse - what happens as he gets older and doesn't want to be doing the fun things his father likes? What if he gets into gaming or has a girlfriend - or a boyfriend? His father will probably struggle to become the not-idolized dad. \nYou on the other hand will continue to be there and be the \"norm\". \n\nSo sit down with him, apologise and tell him that he is allowed to talk about his dad and that you want to know everything about your kid and that means that you also want to hear about the fun things - and all other things - that happens at his fathera house. And maybe bring up that what made you sad was not him talking about his father really but him saying something hurtful. Because you DO get sad if he says things about you being bad, but that has nothing to do with his dad, you get sad if someone at work says something mean too. Everyone gets sad sometimes. \n\nBe the rolemodel he needs! If he told you that you're not man enough then he probably have heard those exact words from his father.

He sees you are different and literally questions everything he knows to this point. Trust me, he is doing this in other areas as well. Instead of feeling attacked, use these as teachable moments. When he questions how a man does not know how to start a fire, just explain that different men know different things. And don't use this as an opportunity to take a shot at his dad.

Proved him right. Edit YTA", "YTA - as other have mentioned, he\u2019s 7. Kids that age are sponges for what people say around them, and will repeat it.\n1. You are likely the polar opposite of the ex. There is a reason for that. More importantly, she chose you over that. \n2. The kid idolizes his dad because he gets to go for these \u201cadventures\u201d - he doesn\u2019t spend enough time with dad to learn what as POS he is. You don\u2019t want to be the one to try to show him either, that will blow back on you. Good advice has been given - talk to him about \u201ccomparing\u201d, not about just talking about his dad.\n3. Want to develop a bond? Don\u2019t try to be the guy your ex chose not to be with. Find things you enjoy to share with him. Teach him what you know about those things, and that you are good at. Also - let him teach you. When you were struggling with the fire, instead of getting upset that he was making comments, ask him to do it himself, and teach you.  I deal with kids this age often, teaching things like outdoor skills, and quite often their parents know nothing about it either. Kids take great pride in doing things like that, and his focus is no longer on what you don\u2019t know. Hand in hand with that, he is spending positive time with you, which is good for that bond. \n4. Look to join an activity or group with the boy, which can be something you two share. Slightly petty, but how good would it feel to know he is going back to dad talking about the adventures you have together? Just an example, I am a Scout leader. Our volunteers often come to us with little to no experience, and we teach them too. We often comment that we just need to learn these things ourselves before we teach the youth, and just need to keep one step ahead of them. You don\u2019t have to be amazing at something to look like you are to a 7 year old.\n5. Just a gut feeling here - your confidence is your biggest challenge, not who you are. Don\u2019t let your self doubt poison your relationships. You need to carefully look at what you have to offer your wife and your son. Learn your strengths, and become comfortable with them. Take comfort in them, and lean on them, use them to present your best. Figure out what areas you truly need to grow, and focus on those to help build your self-confidence. Also figure out your weaknesses, and take a good hard look at what is truly an area you need to grow,  versus what you are only calling a weakness because of what you are trying to compare yourself to. I know some very awesome, well loved dads and step dads who would compare very poorly if you tried to measure their worth based on fitting the traditional \u201cmanly man\u201d archetype, but they are still well loved all the same. For example, I would be willing to bet bio dad is shit at actually being supportive, and will not be someone your son is going to go to when he needs to talk, or have an open dialogue about something. You can become that person, but it starts now, with building trust.", "ESH. You all need therapy. This kid is 7.", "Yta. He's a seven year old kid.

You came across as incredibly jealous and insecure. If I were his mother, I\u2019d be pissed at you too because it is not your place to ever say don\u2019t talk about your father or shut up about your father. Don\u2019t get me wrong, what your stepson said was incredibly inappropriate and wrong for him to say. However he is seven years old and is most likely repeating what has been told to him.

When he was with his dad and I, this is OUR house, so what THEY did didn't matter here as we do things differently. Now, if he thought they had a better/easier way of doing things, I'd love to hear it, but pretty much didn't want to hear \"they do it different\" just because they do it different. He learned to think things thru in that regard, and even told his mom and stepdad what WE did different and possibly easier.  But out-and-out insults, like asking how you were a man if you couldn't build a fire?

Step-dad to step-dad, this is what you signed up for, and you cannnot expect a 7 year old boy to not make these comparisons, or not share them.  Step-dads step-up. It is not an easy job, and certainly not for the over-sensitive. \n\nIf you don't like comparing unfavorably, then make sure you compare favorably. That's on you, and all you can do. Knowing what you know about his father, you probably should have figured out basic stuff like starting a campfire before decididing to take the family camping. Did you not learn these skills growing up? I learned basic skills like that in the Boy Scouts, when I was 12. I would not dream of taking my family camping otherwise. Your step-son knows enough to recognize this at 7, and he's right.  \n\nThe father has an advantage, not just because he had a significant head-start, but because he gets the easier task of fun weekend adventures, rather than the day-to-day not so fun stuff, like dealing with school, his step-siblings, and getting him to keep his room clean. Deal with it.   \nGiven your disadvantages, you have to play your game at a much higher level. \n\nDo not disparage their father. I don't care what kind of stories you've heard from your wife, because they are surely biased, and only one side of the story. Rise above that stuff. You and the father are on the same team, raising HIS son. Never forget that. You do not replace the father. You supplment the father.  \n\nOh, and there's no such thing as an \"ex-Marine\". Once a Marine, always a Marine. Definitely do not hold that against him. You should openly admire that about him, if you know what is good for you. Have a sense of humor about it. Keep some crayons around, for him to snack on. The manliest thing you could do would be to swallow your pride, and ask him to teach you how to build a fire. Be the bigger person, and let your step-son see that. \n\nYou make this into a problem, more than anyone. You can choose to turn that around, and keep your insecurities about it to yourself. You need to lead your household, and demonstrate what that bigger man looks like, for not just your step-son, but for everyone, and especially for those who seem to get that your wife may actually have overcompensated for her ex's hyper-masculine traits. \n\nIt gets better, over time, if you make it better. I have the opposite scenario, where my step-kids avoid talking about me to their weekend father, because he gets visibly upset because he doesn't compare favorably to me. After 4 years of livign with me, they have become resistant to going with their father on Friday nights, and there have been a few tantrums and emotional exclamations of wishing I could be their real dad instead. \n\nIt strokes my ego a bit, but I don't let that show, and I never have anyting but positive things to say about the man. He does his best, and actually seems to care. They are lucky to have their father in their lives, in whatever capacity, and I make sure to express that to them. \n\nThat didn't happen by accident. I worked my ass off to earn that. I suspect that you can too. Whining on Reddit isn't that, unless it adjusts your attitude successfully. \n\nAgain, you signed up for a really tough job here, but it is potentially very rewarding as well. Don't teach the boy what a whiny over-sensitive man looks like. Show him a different version of what a real man looks like. It isn't about muscles and survival skills. It is every bit as much about strength of character, and willingness to sacrifice, and ability to rise above your ego to do what is right for ALL of your family. THAT is what an actual man looks like. \n\nNobody can take that away from you either. You just have to do what it takes to earn it, just like you did what it took to win over their mother.

Now his dad has the upper hand here to continue to outdo you and drive a deeper wedge between you your wife and your step son. Don\u2019t give him that power. A 7 year old is trying to navigate a complicated adult situation. You all are supposed to be there to guide him by example. Leave him out of the grown up stuff and for goodness sakes keep your insecurities out of it. First of all that\u2019s his dad. He\u2019s going to look up to him and idolize him. He\u2019s also going to overcompensate for not having him around every day anymore and he\u2019s dealing with his own insecurities about that. He\u2019s trying to understand where he fits into all this. Secondly if his dad is a crappy guy this kid is going to figure it out on this own and its already going to be hard enough for him without you projecting your disdain onto him. My dad was a dick. We knew it sort of but we saw him one weekend a month and he did everything he could to \u201cbeat\u201d my single working mom. Big vacations TVs video games go carts toys you name it. My mom could barely put food on the table because he didn\u2019t pay her child support after 15 years of abusive marriage but we thought he was the shit because he bought our affection. My mother never said a negative word about him. But guess what. When we weren\u2019t 7 anymore and built up a broader world view we figured it out. Once we started articulating the disparity he completely changed got worse and worse and we saw him less and less. In the end he died alone thousands of miles from his family and my mother passed peacefully in the loving arms of her children who revered her.

He's got to keep you at arm's distance in order to feel like he's being loyal to the father who is emotionally distant or stunted.\n\nMy sense is that he's desperate for his dad's approval and attention.

Very common for kids from divorce and not much you can do about it. You\u2019ll need to find your own way to bond with the kid and show him in which ways you\u2019re great, and as he gets older he\u2019ll understand a little more the situation.

I use it all the time to learn something new.  \nWhat makes you think he was trying to \"out dad\" his real father instead of trying to bond with him over something the kid already enjoys?", "Or maybe he was camping for the kids or just to try something new. My husband and I are crap at most outdoorsy stuff, but my oldest LOVES fishing, hiking, camping, etc. We get fire starter bricks when my marine brother in law doesn't join us for backyard fires.\n\n\nDespite my ineptitude, I'm taking him camping this summer.", "How was the kid not wrong? Just because he's looking into how to properly start a fire doesn't make him any less of a man. What a warped sense of reality.", "Yeah, I was rolling my eyes at the YouTube vid too. Unless OP didn't have matches and was trying to go super old school with two sticks, that's kind of ~~embarrassing~~ weird.", "And why didn\u2019t OP ask the step son to help him build the fire? It would have been a great opportunity to bond.", "Clearly SIL makes her own comments too, so who knows. It could be several adults even within the wife\u2019s family influencing the son\u2019s comment. Kids hear/understand a lot more than adults around them perceive", "OP's wife needs to check in with her son & make sure that the dad isn't saying that BS to or about the son either. If he was abusive to OP's wife, we can pretty reliably assume that his overall mentality is not a great one.", "I dunno.. When we're together, my son & I have 10 billion things to discuss other than his stepdad..", "Depends on the family dynamic. In my family if you cant work on cars, shoot, or navigate the planet, drive any thing with wheels or tracks then you are not really a man.  Having that as my template growing up makes it so the people that do know me are always asking if there is anything I CANT do since I do so much. I think that the kid is getting a similar rearing but perhaps didnt have the chivalrous side added. In our home, women dont touch doors. We open doors and treat them properly.", "I feel like step-dad was doomed either way. If he'd have brought a lighter the kid would have said something most likely and now using YouTube makes him \"less manly\".  Agreed the bio dad has been speaking ill of step-dad.", "What wrong with saying a man needs to know how to make a fire. No different than saying a man should know how to wash his clothes.", "This is great advice! \ud83d\ude42 If I had an award I would give it to you. \n\nClosest I got.... \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47", "Why do you hate that phrase?", "It is not toxic masculinity to think a man should know how to make a fire. Tbh everyone should know it.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mrv2i/aita_for_telling_my_stepson_to_stop_talking_about/jbjhbkl?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3\n\nHey u/chnger937, I think u/Baejax_the_Great nailed it with this comment, please read it", "This is so right. \n\nHe is sadly going to realize who is dad really is one day.  \n\nDon't know when.  I gave up on my dad by 14.  My twin went well into our adulthood before he stopped trying. \n\nInstead of feeling hurt by his comparison.  Realize this is a hurting kid.   I am sure his dad lets him down often. So he tries harder to prove himself worthy. And takes some of it out on you because you are there for him and his dad isn't. \n\nIt is very heartbreaking honestly. \n\nTeeny teeny YTA because part of teaching self control is maintaining it as an adult.", "7 and said \u2018how are you a man\u2019. Still rude. And OP apologised for his behaviour and he at least was trying, unlike the child\u2019s parents.", "My bad, I didn't catch that.", "Believe it or not, he is old enough to take it. I know it won't be easy, but it's better to do this than have him insult the OP all the time. And if you think the kid's father hasn't been actively poisoning his mind to hate his mother's new family, think again. Kids don't get traits of toxic masculinity out of thin air. Like it or not, the OP and his wife need to do something to counter this.", "Exactly. There was nothing inferring that, just a man bonding with his family.", "Or he was just trying to build a fire woth proper air flow, or one that is stable and won\u2019t suddenly shift while burning. There are lots of reason to look at tutorials and trying to gain more knowledge isn\u2019t something that should be put down.", "That's probably because you are secure in your relationship with your son and you don't see your kids step dad as a threat. Unfortunately that's not always the case. Some folks don't like their kids step parents and will make comments here and there about things. It happens. I'm not saying they spend all day talking but it could be the son telling an innocent story about the step dad and bio dad says something judgey.", "In my home, we respect that women are independent humans who can open their own doors.", "I have a lot of family who are that way and I don't really go around them. They try to judge my husband because he cooks, doesn't give a crap about cars except the one he drives, cleans, does childcare and other things \"men aren't supposed to do\". People have different skill sets and that doesn't define their gender. I am more of the outside getting dirty type of woman. Hell, I open the door for my husband sometimes because I love and respect him and want to treat him properly because he treats me properly. Either way it isn't ok to question someones gender based on if they can start a fire or do an oil change or if they can cook or if they open doors for women, because it always comes from a negative place and those things don't make a man or a woman. So yes, he does probably have the same dynamic going in at his dad's house but that doesn't make it right or ok. Toxic masculinity is horrible.", " As a woman, I can open my own doors, thank you very much. Including, politely, for anyone coming up to one behind me, regardless of gender.", "lol women are capable of opening doors just fine, i assure you\n\ntoxic family dynamic", "I agree. That is exactly my point. Op overreacted, the boy is 7 years old...", "I just feel like it's been overused by people referring to masculine behaviors that they just don't like or agree with, namely things that are more traditional.", "maybe the dad made a comment like every man should know/learn how to make a fire and the son ran with it.", "What do you think is a \u2018masculine\u2019 behaviour"]}
