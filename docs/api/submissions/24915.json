Because of those things, I never really cared for celebrating my birthday as I got older and just treat it like any other day.\n\nI have a friend I'll call Bob (26M) who is the complete opposite when it comes to birthdays. He likes to go all out for celebrations and throw big parties for himself as he believes birthdays are a special moment for people. We've been friends for 3 years, and I've never told him when as he's thrown a few parties for some of our other friends as well and I didn't want him to do the same for me. He knows I don't celebrate it and has asked me occasionally when it is, but I just change the topic.\n\nWell, my birthday was a few days ago, and I just so happened to get a text from him asking to hang out as his place. I didn't have anything better to do so I told him I'd stop by. I didn't think much of it because it's not uncommon for him to ask me to come over, and the fact that it was my birthday didn't really seem weird as I was under the impression he still didn't know. \n\nWell just as I was nearing his house, I saw a lot of cars parked on his street and in his driveway, a few of which I recognized. I just thought he invited others and forgot to tell me, but what finally made it click was when I saw my older brother's car. As far as I knew, the two of them have never met, so there shouldn't be any reason for him to just randomly be in the neighborhood. I sat in my car for a minute or two, thinking things over, and decided to text him and say I couldn't make it and just drive home.\n\nWhen I got back home, I had about 12 angry messages from him and 4 missed calls. It turns out either he or someone else saw me arrive then drive away and he figured out what I did.\n\nI called him back, and he was still mad. He didn't even try to keep up the act and kept asking me things like how I could just leave like that when I know how important birthdays are to him. \n\nI asked him how he even found out it was my birthday, and he admitted to stumbling across my mom's Facebook account back in October and finding an old post she had about my birthday, and has been planning since then. He told me that he spent over 600 dollars to give me a good first party, and was asking if I was going to come back.\n\nThe part that I'll admit makes me AH-ish is when I told him that he knows how I feel about my birthday and that I wouldn't be going back, no matter how much money he spent, and the call ended briefly after that.\n\nI got a few texts shortly after from the other party guests, most of which were being neutral about things and just suggesting I just pay him back, which I do actually plan on doing after having some time to think.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1692336735, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ubeod/aita_for_not_attending_a_surprise_birthday_party/", "score": 253, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If someone makes you a lunch you didn't ask for and you don't eat it, them demanding you pay for the ingredients is insane. This is the same thing. Your family might be on the hook for some of it, but you sure as shit aren't.\n\nPeople have reasons for their boundaries, and if you decide to push them without checking first/knowing the reasoning then you sometimes lose out. That's what happens when you decide to gamble on someone being happy that you did something they've told you they don't like.", "NTA, but that's an odd way to react to a surprise party. Even if your friend himself did it for the wrong motives, there were still other people there that showed up because they loved you and wanted to celebrate you. And you're reaction was to run away from that? You should look into that.", "Sadly I cannot vote you T A. I think this friendship may have run it's course, however. Bob knew you did not like parties and he threw a biggie. \n\nNTA", "NTA. It\u2019s your birthday not his. You should apologize for leaving and hurting Bob feelings, because you did and you knew he\u2019d be hurt. But, he went out of his way to intentionally put you in an uncomfortable situation. No payback is necessary, but I think this helps reinforce boundaries", "\\>Your friend goes through the trouble to invite friends and family over to celebrate your birthday\n\nOP never asked him to, that's on his friend.\n\n\\>you ditch out.. why? Because you don\u2019t like celebrating your birthday?\n\nValid enough reason. Why should he have to attend something that he doesn't want to/would make him feel uncomfortable, especially if it's a day only meant for him?\n\n\\>Grow up, you could have had a nice night and been happy but instead you chose to spend your night alone and wasting other peoples time that wanted to see you and spend time with you.\n\nOP said in the first paragraph he never liked being the center of attention, how would you know he would've enjoyed the party? Also just because people came to see him doesn't mean hes obligated to now attend the party. The one that really wasted their time was OP's friend, as OP mentioned near the end of the post, \"I told him that ***he knows how I feel about my birthday*** and that I wouldn't be going back\". Bob's the only AH here.", "Wow. Imagine lacking empathy so much that you can\u2019t even comprehend someone else not wanting a big party. OP is not a \u201cmiserable person\u201d because they don\u2019t want a big blowout birthday party. Bob is TA here and frankly so are you.", "Honestly I'm surprised op even has friends with his attitude"]}
