I was usually given 20 dollars as a present and a few cookies, which I was totally fine with. I also never really liked being the center of attention. Because of those things, I never really cared for celebrating my birthday as I got older and just treat it like any other day.\n\nI have a friend I'll call Bob (26M) who is the complete opposite when it comes to birthdays. He likes to go all out for celebrations and throw big parties for himself as he believes birthdays are a special moment for people. We've been friends for 3 years, and I've never told him when as he's thrown a few parties for some of our other friends as well and I didn't want him to do the same for me. He knows I don't celebrate it and has asked me occasionally when it is, but I just change the topic.\n\nWell, my birthday was a few days ago, and I just so happened to get a text from him asking to hang out as his place. I didn't have anything better to do so I told him I'd stop by. I didn't think much of it because it's not uncommon for him to ask me to come over, and the fact that it was my birthday didn't really seem weird as I was under the impression he still didn't know. \n\nWell just as I was nearing his house, I saw a lot of cars parked on his street and in his driveway, a few of which I recognized. I just thought he invited others and forgot to tell me, but what finally made it click was when I saw my older brother's car. As far as I knew, the two of them have never met, so there shouldn't be any reason for him to just randomly be in the neighborhood. I sat in my car for a minute or two, thinking things over, and decided to text him and say I couldn't make it and just drive home.\n\nWhen I got back home, I had about 12 angry messages from him and 4 missed calls. It turns out either he or someone else saw me arrive then drive away and he figured out what I did.\n\nI called him back, and he was still mad. He didn't even try to keep up the act and kept asking me things like how I could just leave like that when I know how important birthdays are to him. \n\nI asked him how he even found out it was my birthday, and he admitted to stumbling across my mom's Facebook account back in October and finding an old post she had about my birthday, and has been planning since then. He told me that he spent over 600 dollars to give me a good first party, and was asking if I was going to come back.\n\nThe part that I'll admit makes me AH-ish is when I told him that he knows how I feel about my birthday and that I wouldn't be going back, no matter how much money he spent, and the call ended briefly after that.\n\nI got a few texts shortly after from the other party guests, most of which were being neutral about things and just suggesting I just pay him back, which I do actually plan on doing after having some time to think.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1692336735, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ubeod/aita_for_not_attending_a_surprise_birthday_party/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Both feelings are valid, but still an AH move that you called him you cannot go just because you found out they prepared something for you.

The friend was wrong for doing something because he likes it, but people who behave like OP did end up alone and friendless.", "I think the friend mostly just wanted a party.  He would have been ok with pretty much any excuse, but the good deed points would have been a bonus.", "Love it when people use boundaries to justify being an AH.", "I agree with you, that's why I said ESH. But if it's just a scale of who's the bigger AH, I stated OP gets the seat because he had the balls to drive back the moment he realized it was a party for him. If he thinks he's the better friend than Bob, then he should just have compromised and spent time with their mutual friends and even families.
