We understood, but said since it\u2019s March and they have several months maybe they can figure out a plan? She then added her work schedule couldn\u2019t allow it either. My fianc\u00e9e asked if his brother could still come as he really wanted his family there (besides his brother he only has a grandfather who is coming) and then SIL said it was inconsiderate that we picked a hotel that wouldn\u2019t allow her kids and her husband wouldn\u2019t take a trip internationally without them since they\u2019ve never taken a family trip out of the country. The kids were in the background and could be heard yelling \u201clet\u2019s all go to Mexico I wanna go\u201d Then she abruptly got silent and hung up. \n\nI feel bad they can\u2019t join, and briefly debated finding a new hotel - but I really like this hotel and we\u2019ve already paid a deposit.

The hotel choice doesnt make you an asshole, its the fact that fiance and you claim to really want his brother and family to come, but made choices to make it difficult for them, and then ACT SURPRISED. The fact that you debated finding a new hotel makes me think perhaps you and your fiance can afford to change the hotel, but are choosing not to... says a lot. Also, you could have offered to find a hotel nearby for his family, if that really is what you guys wanted to do.  At the end of the day, they chose not to attend this wedding for many reasons, but I can assure you that one of them is that they don't think they are needed there.

Your SIL is also correct that you were inconsiderate to ask BIL to come alone, *unless you were offering to pay all costs*.

Or they could look into other childcare and leave the kids in the states.

However, I'd say the risk of opening a can of worms here is decently large. Figuring out what to do with a 4 year old is pretty tough when we already know there's no family on your BIL's side (as only the grandfather is there and he'll be at the wedding) and who knows what SIL's situation is. Unless it's a family member or friend she really deeply trusts I also wouldn't feel comfortable leaving my 4 year old with someone for days on end. You're not obligated to consider your BIL/SIL/family for the wedding, but by choosing a place that made it super easy for your family to attend (visa-wise), you somewhat neglected making it easy for your fiancee's family. \n\nSo NTA, but there's a good chance your fiancee will only have her grandfather for family at her  wedding and these choices do contribute to it. If you both are cool with that then, then absolutely stick to your guns.", "NAH. You can do what you want it's your wedding. But she's in her right to feel slighted that she can't attend her own siblings wedding. I would be pretty sad if I couldn't go to my brother's wedding. And no, she can't just stay at another hotel because how would they possibly find an all day sitter in another country?", "i think the reason the SIL and brother cant attend the destination wedding is becuase she didnt want to say that they could not afford to go so maybe they used those excuses to save some dignity  destination weddings can certainly be a big ask in terms of expense.", "NTA.

You offered them an airB&B, if they refused to take that, that's a them problem.", "NTA\n\nIs there no other hotel in the area around the one you are staying at? My family stayed in like 5 different hotels when I got married.", "NTA as long as you didn\u2019t push the issue of them not coming", "I'd say NTA, but that's because I don't believe that anyone should plan their wedding around anyone else's availability or circumstances.\n\nYour brother's girlfriend getting mad that you didn't accommodate their kids makes no sense to me, since she claims her work schedule wouldn't allow her to attend the wedding anyways. Seems like a classic case of FOMO for the girlfriend and she knows she can't go so she'll find a way to make every alternative accommodation seem not good enough. Though to be honest, you shouldn't be changing around *your wedding* plans to accommodate anyone else.\n\nI don't understand the people saying \"you accommodated your family but not his\" when I'm sure there are plenty of adults in your family who also have kids that won't be able to attend either or will have to make babysitting arrangements for them too.", "NTA for choosing a hotel you like, but you really should have considered that of course they won\u2019t be able to come.

Like no, you made sure our kids can\u2019t come, and we aren\u2019t leaving them alone or with a babysitter for a week or 2.

Stop projecting and read for comprehension!", "YTA. Your family is 100% allowed to turn down your invitation just like you are allowed to 100% choose an adult only hotel for your wedding.", "YTA. I generally think destination weddings are an AH move because it makes clear that the couple is more interested in the beach in Hawaii or the villa in Tuscany or whatever than with having the people who are supposed to mean something to them be at the wedding or that they have no compunctions about asking those people to spend a huge amount of money on their speshul, speshul day. And, no, the fact that there\u2019s a whole industry built around destination weddings does not mean they\u2019re not an AH choice, it just means that there are a lot of AH\u2019s.\n\nBut, assuming you\u2019re being straightforward about your reasons for Mexico\\*, your wedding does seem like an exception to the general rule.\n\nBut picking an adult only hotel just because you liked it? I\u2019m sure there were plenty of other very nice hotels in Cancun or wherever that permit children. You chose this hotel without even checking with BIL and SIL first to see if it would work for them. So clearly you cared more about this particular hotel than about your fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother being at the wedding. Straight up AH move.\n\n\\*The reason I suspect the relatives and visas explanation may be your cover story, not the real  motivation behind your choice is this\n\n>First the destination (I even offered to do it in FL and reduce some of my family coming and he wanted it to be Mexico)\n\nHe wanted it to be in Mexico. I suspect you two just really like Cancun or wherever and extended family and visas is just the rationalization you two came up with to justify your choice. Family is very nice, but saying you want it to be in Mexico just so your extended family can easily attend but  the two of you have no qualms about holding it in a place your fianc\u00e9\u2019s own brother can\u2019t attend doesn\u2019t pass the smell test.", "NTA. \n\nThey can't find a sitter, can't get the time off work?

Screw that.", "[deleted]", "Can\u2019t respond to all comments but just an update after my fianc\u00e9 spoke to his family again and we explained that part of the reason for our hotel choice was because my family is paying for all family members to attend and if we included children it would be another 20k for my dad to spend (who is paying for the wedding) and SIL responded and basically said she understood why we wouldn\u2019t want other kids to attend but her kids should still be able to come with her. So we asked if that meant she could get time off - and she said no it was not guaranteed but IF she could (which she wouldn\u2019t find out till the week of the wedding) she would want her kids to be the exception to attend", "Once you say to some parents that you\u2019d prefer an event be child-free, you\u2019ll find they dig in their heels and insist that they be enabled to bring their kids. More than stubbornness, It\u2019s about control. Nobody inhibits them or their kids in any way. I\u2019m afraid you have now drawn a line in the sand, and if you still want the parents at your wedding, I believe you\u2019ll lose. They may also be too broke, and for many Americans, particularly if they\u2019re New Yorkers, it\u2019s utterly humiliating to admit that. A destination is too costly for many if they can\u2019t classify it budgetarily as the annual family vacation. So their rejection of your event is probably a combination. The good thing is, you don\u2019t have to go to their destination in the future. But if you want to salvage this occasion as well as keep these particular relatives happy, you\u2019ll now have to cave in and submit.In my mind, NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That\u2019s ridiculous.", "When my kid was the age of those kids, I literally did not have anyone local who I could have or would have asked to take my kid for a long weekend or a week. It\u2019s a big ask and it\u2019s hardly the same as calling the high school kid who babysits on a Saturday night.\n\nThey might be able to get the days off, but don\u2019t consider going away on an expensive trip without their kids to be a good use of their time or money.", "Where did she say her SIL was pestering her to change the date. OP was pestering her to go.", "If you're not willing to make a commitment to your fianc\u00e9's family, why should they make a commitment to you?

Do these people not understand how to use birth control? Are they under the illusion that children will keep someone around who really wants to leave?", "I was actually going to say NAH since her SIL has valid reasons too and none that make her a asshole but yeah that last little dig at her is so uncalled for sounds like her and her fiance deserve each other.", "its still tacky whether it was from you or your fiancee. the SIL had a perfectly legit reason not to come. we did not need to know she \"isnt real family\" and even if she is upset about not having a destination wedding, her reason is still valid. \n\nadults can be sad about one thing and not let it color their choices.", "You\u2019re jealous of your sil it seems.", "So your fiancee is the tacky asshole, got it.

My good friend got married with just her spouse and herself and a good friend present on a mountain, and they don't regret it at all. I've known people where they've said \"no kids\". I've known people who have said \"kids welcome!\" I've known people who only want family present and will celebrate with friends at a different time. Some people want their whole family and friends to be present and others don't. There's no one size fits all approach for a wedding.
