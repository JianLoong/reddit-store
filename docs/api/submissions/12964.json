The hotel choice doesnt make you an asshole, its the fact that fiance and you claim to really want his brother and family to come, but made choices to make it difficult for them, and then ACT SURPRISED. The fact that you debated finding a new hotel makes me think perhaps you and your fiance can afford to change the hotel, but are choosing not to... says a lot. Also, you could have offered to find a hotel nearby for his family, if that really is what you guys wanted to do.  At the end of the day, they chose not to attend this wedding for many reasons, but I can assure you that one of them is that they don't think they are needed there.

Your SIL is also correct that you were inconsiderate to ask BIL to come alone, *unless you were offering to pay all costs*.

She's not jealous; she's annoyed that you asked her husband to spend thousands of dollars (and however much time away) to travel internationally at the exclusion of her and her kids.\n\nDouble YTA for thinking that sharing an AirBnB with people they don't know and leaving them to figure out meals and other logistics is somehow incentivizing.", "YTA.

There are so many reasons that someone can't attend a wedding, especially one that requires an international trip, and no guests owe you an explanation.\n\nYou made the decision to prioritize your family in Mexico over your family here, now deal with it.", "NAH. Destination wedding means you need to accept the fact that some invitees will be a \"no\" for various reasons. The hotel being adults-only is another factor that might elicit a \"no.\"\n\nYour future BIL/SIL could stay at a different hotel. Your future BIL could come alone. Or they could look into other childcare and leave the kids in the states.

Better chance of them figuring out a solution without SIL in the mix.", "YTA. It\u2019s weird to me that you had a destination wedding to make it easier for your family to come but then chose an adults only hotel knowing that it would make it much harder for lots of family to come.", "YTA.

Not really your SIL? You went there. No, she isn't jealous of you.", "I'm not saying youre an AH for having a destination wedding, you do you, but they are annoying.

However, I'd say the risk of opening a can of worms here is decently large. Figuring out what to do with a 4 year old is pretty tough when we already know there's no family on your BIL's side (as only the grandfather is there and he'll be at the wedding) and who knows what SIL's situation is. Unless it's a family member or friend she really deeply trusts I also wouldn't feel comfortable leaving my 4 year old with someone for days on end. You're not obligated to consider your BIL/SIL/family for the wedding, but by choosing a place that made it super easy for your family to attend (visa-wise), you somewhat neglected making it easy for your fiancee's family. \n\nSo NTA, but there's a good chance your fiancee will only have her grandfather for family at her  wedding and these choices do contribute to it. If you both are cool with that then, then absolutely stick to your guns.", "NAH. You can do what you want it's your wedding. But she's in her right to feel slighted that she can't attend her own siblings wedding. I would be pretty sad if I couldn't go to my brother's wedding. And no, she can't just stay at another hotel because how would they possibly find an all day sitter in another country?", "i think the reason the SIL and brother cant attend the destination wedding is becuase she didnt want to say that they could not afford to go so maybe they used those excuses to save some dignity  destination weddings can certainly be a big ask in terms of expense.", "NTA. It's your wedding and it's your right to pick whatever place you want. You offered them an airB&B, if they refused to take that, that's a them problem.", "NTA\n\nIs there no other hotel in the area around the one you are staying at? My family stayed in like 5 different hotels when I got married.", "NTA as long as you didn\u2019t push the issue of them not coming", "I'd say NTA, but that's because I don't believe that anyone should plan their wedding around anyone else's availability or circumstances.\n\nYour brother's girlfriend getting mad that you didn't accommodate their kids makes no sense to me, since she claims her work schedule wouldn't allow her to attend the wedding anyways. Seems like a classic case of FOMO for the girlfriend and she knows she can't go so she'll find a way to make every alternative accommodation seem not good enough. Though to be honest, you shouldn't be changing around *your wedding* plans to accommodate anyone else.\n\nI don't understand the people saying \"you accommodated your family but not his\" when I'm sure there are plenty of adults in your family who also have kids that won't be able to attend either or will have to make babysitting arrangements for them too.", "NTA for choosing a hotel you like, but you really should have considered that of course they won\u2019t be able to come. If I were them, I would be kind of annoyed at the whole \u201cwell maybe you\u2019ll get it together and figure out a way! We really want you to come!\u201d thing. Like no, you made sure our kids can\u2019t come, and we aren\u2019t leaving them alone or with a babysitter for a week or 2. And finding childcare while in another country is not easy, so it\u2019s not like we can just bring them and stay at a different hotel unless one of us misses the wedding.\n\nI think the only way you would be the AH is if you keep insisting that they come, or feel slighted when they don\u2019t, since you\u2019ve made it quite difficult for them to attend.", "YTA not for your wedding plans, as others have pointed out, it's your wedding and you can plan it however you'd like but YTA for not just dropping it when they said they can't come.", "NTA", "NTA.

But since you have just expressed that you'd like them to be there but that you also have your own vision for your wedding, that's not your fault that it's not their vision.

Stop projecting and read for comprehension!", "YTA. Your family is 100% allowed to turn down your invitation just like you are allowed to 100% choose an adult only hotel for your wedding.", "YTA. I generally think destination weddings are an AH move because it makes clear that the couple is more interested in the beach in Hawaii or the villa in Tuscany or whatever than with having the people who are supposed to mean something to them be at the wedding or that they have no compunctions about asking those people to spend a huge amount of money on their speshul, speshul day. And, no, the fact that there\u2019s a whole industry built around destination weddings does not mean they\u2019re not an AH choice, it just means that there are a lot of AH\u2019s.\n\nBut, assuming you\u2019re being straightforward about your reasons for Mexico\\*, your wedding does seem like an exception to the general rule.\n\nBut picking an adult only hotel just because you liked it? I\u2019m sure there were plenty of other very nice hotels in Cancun or wherever that permit children. You chose this hotel without even checking with BIL and SIL first to see if it would work for them. So clearly you cared more about this particular hotel than about your fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother being at the wedding. Straight up AH move.\n\n\\*The reason I suspect the relatives and visas explanation may be your cover story, not the real  motivation behind your choice is this\n\n>First the destination (I even offered to do it in FL and reduce some of my family coming and he wanted it to be Mexico)\n\nHe wanted it to be in Mexico. I suspect you two just really like Cancun or wherever and extended family and visas is just the rationalization you two came up with to justify your choice. Family is very nice, but saying you want it to be in Mexico just so your extended family can easily attend but  the two of you have no qualms about holding it in a place your fianc\u00e9\u2019s own brother can\u2019t attend doesn\u2019t pass the smell test.", "NTA. \n\nThey can't find a sitter, can't get the time off work?

Screw that.", "[deleted]", "Can\u2019t respond to all comments but just an update after my fianc\u00e9 spoke to his family again and we explained that part of the reason for our hotel choice was because my family is paying for all family members to attend and if we included children it would be another 20k for my dad to spend (who is paying for the wedding) and SIL responded and basically said she understood why we wouldn\u2019t want other kids to attend but her kids should still be able to come with her. So we asked if that meant she could get time off - and she said no it was not guaranteed but IF she could (which she wouldn\u2019t find out till the week of the wedding) she would want her kids to be the exception to attend", "Once you say to some parents that you\u2019d prefer an event be child-free, you\u2019ll find they dig in their heels and insist that they be enabled to bring their kids. More than stubbornness, It\u2019s about control. Nobody inhibits them or their kids in any way. I\u2019m afraid you have now drawn a line in the sand, and if you still want the parents at your wedding, I believe you\u2019ll lose. They may also be too broke, and for many Americans, particularly if they\u2019re New Yorkers, it\u2019s utterly humiliating to admit that. A destination is too costly for many if they can\u2019t classify it budgetarily as the annual family vacation. So their rejection of your event is probably a combination. The good thing is, you don\u2019t have to go to their destination in the future. But if you want to salvage this occasion as well as keep these particular relatives happy, you\u2019ll now have to cave in and submit.In my mind, NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That is just something you assumed. There is nothing wrong with a destination wedding and op literally gave them a bunch of options so the don\u2019t drop everything go an event that is SEVEN MONTHS in the future. Not in the next seven hours. Op is NTA", "She is TA for having a destination wedding? The talked for 5 minutes and the SIL is the one who gave multiple excuses and then came out with saying it was inconsiderate to choose a child free hotel and wedding. \nYou have a bad take. \nThe SIL could've just said no, but decided to male it about herself. She is TA", "Lol no op is not the Ah. She can choose to have her wedding WHERE EVER she wants. \nShe\u2019s not expecting them to drop everything, she asked if they could attend, gave them a great time frame to plan then sil said SHE could not attend then banned the fianc\u00e9s brother from going because she couldn\u2019t go?! It\u2019s not ops job to accommodate anyone and sil banning him from going because she can\u2019t (she hasn\u2019t even spoken to the brother, just made the decision FOR HIM) is a joke.\nIf they can\u2019t go, they can\u2019t go but sil cannot DEMAND to be accommodated.

She invited them, SIL said she couldn\u2019t. She tried to offer a couple of solutions and then immediately dropped it. She\u2019s not consistently pestering them or causing drama.

She\u2019s not an asshole for that.\n\nThe main thing that tips this over into AH territory is making it child free. Child free weddings themselves are fine but on top of a destination wedding it\u2019s a ridiculous ask. A destination wedding can at least also be a family vacation, but if you make it child free you\u2019re asking people to spend a lot of money *just* on your wedding and excluding family members.", "Lol.

But that's very different from someone else *asking* me to stay home with the kids so my partner can make it.", "I feel as though a multi-day vacation while partner is alone with young kids is a bit much though. That's a big ask. Especially if said partner is unlikely to get their own vacation away from the kids in the forseeable future.", "I didn't. I thought it was perfectly fine. What ISN'T fine and what makes her the AH is that she chose a whole destination for HER family but then chooses a hotel that makes one of TWO family members her fiancee has not able/willing to come because \"She REALLY likes the hotel\".", "Not at all. I think a destination wedding to include OP's extended family is a *great* idea. But early in the planning process they should have resolved things so that the major family members her fiance has should also be able to attend. Picking a child-free venue before clearing that with *family who have little kids who would be traveling from out of country* is going to limit even more who can attend.\n\nOf course SIL and the kids would feel excluded.", "Seems like that would depend on your finances/time off.  If money's no issue then sure Brother going solo is no big deal.  If Brothers vacation time is limited, or going solo to Mexico impacts the budget of family/couples vacation, then OP could be a little bit of an asshole for trying to guilt brother into coming when it isn't feasible.", "Exactly. SIL's family probably cannot afford high expense holidays and I wouldn't waste what little money I have on a poorly planned destination wedding where I'll be thrown to a squalor mexican Airbnb just to fulfil OP's wishes.", "Oh yeah, staying in an Airbnb with strangers and my bored, upset kids who want to go do the things everyone else gets to do, but aren't allowed,  while all the other adults  party at the all inclusive resort sounds like *sooooo* much fun! /s \n\nDo you even know what it's like to travel with children?  Especially for the poor 4 year old! \n\nPlus, who's going to watch them during the wedding, because I sure as fuck would not be leaving my kids alone with \"family\" I've never met in a foreign country. \n\nSo even during the wedding, we don't get to go. There'd be literally no point in being there. \n\nOP can have a child free wedding if she wants, but she doesn't get to pull a surprised face when her family with children decline the invitation.", "Exactly, it sounds more like trying to talk through the situation to find a solution. NtA\n\nOn top of that, it seems like the SIL keeps moving the bar. Each time they try to come up with a solution, there's a new issue. With the edit about the AirBnB, the issue becomes missing out on the all inclusive part, but that wouldn't matter if she actually had an issue where she couldn't get time off of work. She just flat doesn't want to go.", "As a married man with children who's only friends are also married men with children I don't know a single one of us who would leave our family behind to go to our brothers wedding. Every last one of us would call our brother a selfish prick and tell him to call us back when he gets his head out of his ass. My wife and children are far more important to me than my brother and I don't know a married man who would say otherwise.", "Tbf it made it harder for his family to go but having it in the US would make it impossible for her family to go. There is a difference. Visas to the US are hard to get especially if you are from certain countries.

Does her fianc\u00e9 not like his brother? Or is he just a total pushover?", "Yes, I agree. That's what pushed them ahole territory.  If someone want a designation wedding, that's fine.

There's no one else to run the program.", "A destination wedding is typically one that takes place somewhere that the couple / the guests don\u2019t live. If the couple live in Detroit, then it makes sense that some of their friends & family may also live in Detroit, even if you don\u2019t. In this case, none of the guests live in Cabo, so 100% of the guests need to pay travel costs to attend the wedding. \n\nDestination weddings also have a reputation of being longer than just a 1-2 day event. That wedding in Detroit is probably a Friday night - Sunday morning thing, unless you personally choose to extend your stay. You\u2019re not being asked to spend 5-7 days. Also, resorts that offer destination weddings typically offer incentives for the couple, meaning that getting X amount of guests to book rooms at the resort earns freebie extras for the couple. Some people find that arrangement to be distasteful.", "This. Thank you for exercising a bit of critical thinking. There's a lot of people who seems to think the Airbnb alternative is a viable solution and that SIL's future plans for a family holiday as a whole is not important", "I don't know how this is so hard to understand. Op fully admits they haven't had an international family trip, which means based on the oldest could be over a decade of at least 5 years if you go by youngest.
