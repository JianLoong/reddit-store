I generally just want everyone to believe in what they want, within reason. \n\nI live in a small town, and have a friend who has grown up very conservatively and who\u2019s always been apart of the church. She\u2019s recently decided to re-dedicate her life to the Lord, which I support her in, but she won\u2019t stop trying to talk to me about Christianity when we\u2019re together. She\u2019s asked me about my beliefs before, and has challenged them because they contradict hers, and I\u2019ve told her this makes me uncomfortable but didn\u2019t really take offense at the time. She insists she \u201cjust wants to understand\u201d what I believe in, but I don\u2019t think this is the case because she then tells me that Jesus exists and I should have a relationship with him, go to church, etc. Lol. I\u2019ve kind of just changed subjects or flat out said \u201cno\u201d and she\u2019d back off. \n\nYesterday, she was talking about how the end times are coming because all of the signs that are talked about in the Bible are there. I told her that if the rapture does happen, I doubt it will be in this lifetime (not that I didn\u2019t believe in it entirely - I don\u2019t presume to know that it will or won\u2019t for a fact happen). All of the \u201csigns\u201d she pointed out have happened before, at more dire conditions.\n\nShe immediately said, \u201cbut you understand that if it does happen soon, you\u2019ll go to Hell, right? You aren\u2019t going to Heaven because you don\u2019t have a relationship with Jesus and you haven\u2019t accepted him in your life. I just love you and I want you to go to Heaven.\u201d \n\nI snapped and told her she can\u2019t just say shit like that to people. I told her I don\u2019t believe that I\u2019m going to Hell, and that my beliefs are just as valid as hers whether she chooses to accept that or not, and that I know she loves me but she has to respect me too. I said that I feel like she equates agnosticism with being confused, lost, etc. and that she wouldn\u2019t argue with me if I outright said I was Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, or any other religion - to which she insisted she would, which I think is even worse lol. I think she\u2019s very sheltered and doesn\u2019t realized how inappropriate that is. I told her it makes me deeply uncomfortable. The whole time, her sister was chiming in and backing her up/defending her intentions, and my friend started tearing up and said she wont bring it up anymore in a very hurt tone.\n\nAnd now I feel like an ass, because I do believe her intentions were kind and I do value our friendship.

Abraham?) had to spend a night with a pagan and became angry and forced him to leave only to be chastized by God for doing so, as God said something along the lines of I've put up with him for his entire life, I only asked you to put up with him for a night.

Especially the whole \"well you're going to Hell, blah blah blah\" and it's like seriously?

I just never understood that. \n\nI get crap too when I say that I also believe in the Big Bang, specifically because in the Bible it says it took X amount of days for God to create everything, but I highly doubt 7 human days. That could be millions of our years. We will never know.\n\nAnyways, you're not the Asshole.

Youve repeatedly informed her that she makes you uncomfortable and she persists in doing it over and over..SHE should be apologizingto YOU. It's past time that people understand that continuously telling people who believe differently that they're \"going to hell\" or some other nonsense, stops. It's one thing to share your beliefs but something totally different when they go on and on and on about it trying to convert people.

She'll get too sanctimonious and find friends that match her beliefs, and you'll get too annoyed with her pushy ways", "Religious youths --the really devout kind-- genuinely don't have a healthy way of determining what is appropriate or inappropriate in social settings.\n\nEvangelical Christianity wants to be persecuted for their beliefs because they see that as a sign that they're on the right path. So it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy (pardon the pun) that those who are the most \"on fire\" for the Lord will see the most push back from \"the world.\" This version of Christianity teaches them to push really far into other people's lives, which obviously will violate most people's boundaries. If they get a convert out of it, great. But if not, then they'll most likely be shunned or reproached by the would-be-convert and the faithful just interpret that as the sort of persecution that reinforces their beliefs.\n\nAdd that to the fact that young people are still learning social interactions without a lot of personal experience, and you get someone who has no sense of where boundaries are with normal people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Source: this was me, decades ago. I'm on the spectrum and don't get social interaction to begin with.

My friends don't try to drag me to Jesus, and I don' try to convince them to leave their faiths. Sometimes it can be hard for people to understand the other side though (this goes doubly so if someone has gone really deep into religious territory and thinks you're doomed to eternal damnation if they don't help you. which it sounds like your friend is at).\n\nIt may be a good idea to give her a bit of space for the time being, but assuming she's still ok being friends, let her know that you don't hate her or anything, and ask maybe suggest that the two of you avoid discussing religion again.", "NTA but you need to end this friendship for the sake of your mental health.

Stuff like 'love thy neighbor' and not judging others xD", "NTA. I had a similar experience and lost a longtime childhood friend over his growing fanaticism and continued and ever more pressured attempts to convert me. People should not push their beliefs on others and especially should be telling their friends that they are going to hell.

She may be going to a church that's pressures the congregation to save as many as possible.  Maybe let her know that you heard what she had to say, that you know it's because she wants the best for you.  She's done her part to \"Spread the Good News\" to you and it's now a closed subject, should YOU ever want to talk about Jesus you know she's there.", "NTA at all. It sounds like you\u2019ve made real efforts to respect her beliefs while still staying true to your own. It\u2019s sounds like you\u2019ve tried to set boundaries when talking about this subject with her and you\u2019ve communicated repeatedly when you\u2019re uncomfortable. To me it\u2019s clear that she does not respect your beliefs and she believes her way is the best/only way. \n\nI\u2019m an agnostic-atheist and I find it hard to be friends with deeply religious people. Unfortunately I\u2019ve had a close friendship die out when my friend switched from sharing the same beliefs as me to being very Christian.

For example: My son isn't Baptized but I feel he's Saved bc that involves the belief that Jesus died for his sins. That's it. That's all you need. The rest is semantics. I don't think Jesus will look at him and say \"not enough water.

Using God as a threat and assuming His judgment on no basis, since we cannot know the will of God.\n\nAlso, it's absurd to think someone would be doomed to Hell just because they believe in something slightly different than her, specifically. Was she there when the Bible was written? Is she a prophet or something? Because I doubt it.

Do unto others, yadda yadda.\nI'll go as far as to say that being a decent person is more important than following the church's (didn't use a capital letter on purpose) doctrine... Since it's been so damn long the current doctrine is 99% bullshit. I'm not saying that as an insult, interpreting the Bible however you like is well within anyone's rights, as long as the core message is intact. She really butchers it though. Tremendously.\n\nThe Bible is a story about wanting people to be decent and since humans are turds, it's written as if being decent is a law with a punishment, as opposed to... You know, a logical conclusion as to how to make living ina  society bearable. Can't teach some illiterate people that incest is bad cause of science stuff, so you tell them they'll burn up after they die if they screw their nephew  etc.\n\nShe's taking the punishment part without the goal of the punishment, which is FOR HER TO BE A GOOD PERSON.\n\nIf the Bible's getting butchered so damn bad, fuck, is it even a holy text anymore?

I don't blame you one bit, I know how exhausting that shit gets.

Understand that *to her* it would be unkind and disrespectful *not* to try to save her friend safe from hell. To her, hell is just as real as the home she lives in and the food she eats and the ground she walks on.

Maybe tell her you won't be discussing these things with her anymore, period.", "As an open atheist as well this is the best thing I've read on reddit today lol", "Kinda funny how people who think they'll go to heaven if they die still want a shitload of guns to protect them from being killed ... \ud83d\ude12\ud83e\udd14", "I\u2019m the same, but if she kept challenging my beliefs I would ask her to prove that her\u2019s were real and mine weren\u2019t. \n\nThe only proof I would accept is for God to show himself. And we all know that isn\u2019t happening.", "I love when people can accept both religion/spirituality and science, and understand that the two can be intertwined. Am I inclined to believe in a higher power? Sure. But I don\u2019t understand why concepts like evolution, the Big Bang, etc. should threaten that", "About the seven days thing, have you ever checked debates about the usage of time measurement in the Bible? A popular one is that God didn't take ANY days to create anything, and those were just steps. Because, obviously, there can't be time before time exists, right?", ">She insists she \u201cjust wants to understand\u201d what I believe in, but I don\u2019t think this is the case\n\nThis is **NEVER** the case, **EVER.** You should exit the friendship because unless she loses her Christianity she will **NEVER STOP** trying to bring you back to the church. NTA", "It sounds like she just wants a convert to boost her numbers, or heaven points, or something.", "Dude I could not agree more lol I am SO thankful I grew up in a school district that teaches about other religions at an early age", "Does she deeply care though? It might be my religious trauma talking but in my experience that people who try to heavily convert others and aren't able to let it go are often doing it for self-serving reasons.\n\nIt's about them, not the people they're trying to \"save\"", "I definitely can see this POV. It\u2019s far more nuanced than her just judging, being intolerant, etc. because she truly believes she\u2019s helping.", "I recommend stealing it; have fun with one of your friends with it.", "Eh some people like just having them to shoot or look at", "My dad used to be religious (no idea what exactly he believes now but he's made a few comments about not believing in God) and he has guns because he's a hunter.", ">The only proof I would accept is for God to show himself. \n\nOr if They loaded a patch that let me become a werewolf. But I think it's pretty obvious that if They're there, that They're AFK and have us running in the background while they do other more interesting things. Because if there is a Singular God of *that* level, and we're based on Their image, then it should be pretty obvious that we're just a SIMs run to them. I'm just glad to not be stuck in a bathroom without a door, although I'll swear most of my tripping incidents were due to clipping errors and totally not my fault.", "Yes. Exactly. For her she legitimately thinks what she is doing is g-ds work, in her mind it doesn\u2019t matter if you crack a few eggs while baking a cake. In my mind it\u2019s not worth continuing in a friendship where you question if you\u2019re friend respects you.", "from how OP described it, I think it's from a concern that a close friend will suffer if she doesn't help. similar things happen sometimes with couples where one is not religious an the other partner is.", "There\u2019s \u201chelp\u201d and then there\u2019s \u201chlep.\u201d If you didn\u2019t want her help, she\u2019s not helping, and you shouldn\u2019t be made to feel bad for that. She needs to STFU and back off.", "Yeah, and that's a really difficult spot to be in with someone when they just can't/won't see that their \"help\" is actually doing more harm than good. Plus she'll have plenty of people (like her sister, it sounds like) encouraging her that she's in the right and should keep going. IMO either she needs to drop the topic altogether or this friendship is only going to get more and more strained.", "It makes more and more sense the older I get."]}
