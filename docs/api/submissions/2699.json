Her feelings are valid regardless of your opinion.", "oof. YTA. You were essentially making fun of her to your friends because of a health issue she has to deal with. Super not cool. Then you essentially disregarded her feelings by laughing at her attempt to show you it's hurtful, and then the whole \"good night grandma\" bit. I'm not sure how you thought that was even remotely appropriate at that point. The bottom line is that she has some health issues causing her to have to use the bathroom in the night. How do you think that's an okay thing to joke about with your friend? So insensitive. There was just no regard for her potential desire for privacy when it comes to health problems. Beyond that, being called an \"old lady\" by *your partner*, who you just had a baby with, is just a a really shitty low blow.", "Obviously YTA here.  You don\u2019t seem remorseful in the slightest since you keep joking about it.  Not only is she offended that you made a joke about her to your friends, but now she\u2019s also insecure about her needing to get up constantly to use the restroom because of her medical condition.", "YTA.

No explanation needed.

Right? \n\nWow, seriously YTA.", "So let me get this straight. You made a comment to your friends about \u201csleeping next to an old lady\u201d but couldn\u2019t explain the reason for the comment because it\u2019s too personal (by your own admission). Yeah dude, YTA. \n\nYour reasoning for this was because she struggles with incontinence due to her HAVING A BABY and frequent urination due to a MEDICAL CONDITION. Oh and drooling. It\u2019s fair she doesn\u2019t want this broadcasted and is likely insecure/sensitive about these facts. \n\nBest response in this scenario is \u201cyeah it takes getting used to sharing a bed, wife and I still go through waves of struggle not having our own space\u201d\n\nHonestly, may I suggest separate bedrooms? It\u2019s  more common than most people thing and could solve some issues in your marriage.", "YTA while I don't think your initial joke was meant to be hurtful, when you realized you accidentally hurt your wife's feelings you handled it all wrong. It doesn't matter that your intent was not to hurt her feelings, you did and now you are doubling down and continuing to poke - now you are intentionally hurting her and that makes you an ass.

As women, we struggle all our lives to accept our bodies and then we have a baby and it changes all over again.  We have to start the process of accepting this new one too.  I have to pee constantly since having my kid and it is not delightful for me, but is a testament to the fact that my badass body grew and birthed a human.  You're joking and minimizing the fact that her body has changed profoundly and she's likely feeling insecure and inconvenienced by it far more than you are.  \n\nMy husband is a really restless sleeper and I am a very light sleeper. Tempurpedic saved our marriage.", "Well, I, at twice your age, am often up and down for the bathroom too. It's really no fun, and I expect that's why your wife doesn't think it's funny.

Just don't do it again.", "YTA, you fucked up bad, but at least you made it 10 years before you fucked up this bad.

But the even bigger issue is that she told you it\u2019s embarrassing and instead of dropping it, you are trying to convince her (and us) that no, it\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s only a joke if the butt of the joke is laughing, else it\u2019s just bullying.\n\n>> ironically enough though she is still proving my point as the baby has yet to cry but she is up and down for the loo (like an old person)\n\nLol, haha, we get your point. Your wife is not getting any sleep even when the baby is sleeping. Hilarious. /s\n\nDude, drop it. YTA", "my guy why post on this sub if everyone comment of yours is you still trying to defend yourself. you\u2019re TA! anyone can see that and the fact you make fun of her for something she can\u2019t control and is a medical issue is j kinda gross and disrespectful. \u201ci may have backtracked BUT I STILL APOLOGIZED EARLIER AND IT SHOULD BE FINE\u201d your bs apologizes are half assed and not sincere obvi she\u2019s still upset", "So, not only is your wife 5 months post partum but she has an autoimmune condition (type 1 diabetes), which likely complicated her pregnancy, and you mocked the state her poor body is in after **building you a human** in front of your friends? \n\nDamn, I'd just be grateful she's ok and be doing whatever she needs to support her while she heals, not making her the butt of some cheap joke. I hope it was worth it. \n\nYTA. You are, unequivocally, TA.\n\nI hope she is just as graceless and cavalier towards you when your health starts to waiver, you glib, self centred ass. \n\nAlso, maybe get off said arse and tend to the baby yourself once in a while instead of making someone with a long-term medical condition pick up all the slack. Just an idea.", "\"I\u2019ve seen in post comments \u201cthis is a deal breaker\u201d or \u201cleave them\u201d and I\u2019d like to preemptively ask for people to not say this\"\n\nOh, buddy, you think we're going to tell you to leave your wife... It's the other way around. She deserves an understanding partner that doesn't ridicule her and doesn't backtrack on his half-assed apologies. YTA", "So, she\u2019s just had a baby meaning her body has been through hell and back, and hasn\u2019t belonged to her for a while now. She\u2019s probably getting used to all the changes growing and expelling a whole human made in her body, too. \n\nOn top of that she is trying to manage her diabetes, which with a baby is an extra challenge as babies are especially known for messing up your eating schedule. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t get to sleep properly because either the baby or her bladder keep her up. \n\nPlus she drools which - from experience - is embarrassing on no matter how much the other person tells you it\u2019s not. \n\nAll of that on her plate and the ONE person she trusts to share a bed with and be comfortable around just decided to make all of that a joke in front of his buddies. \n\nShe\u2019s 25.

Wow, very insensitive. Well your grandma of a wife is dealing with so much her levels are probably off. If she's a sensitive person then her sensitivity may have heightened. I also never understand why folks try to embarrass their partners and then act like it's ok? Truth be told, you want her to suck it up!\n Put yourself in her shoe! YTA", "YTA!!!!", "YTA she has medical issues that cause her to pee a lot and one of those issues was caused by YOU. Having a baby messes up all of her insides and they never are quite the same again.

Especially because in your comments all you do is double down rather than respect the fact you were hurtful.", "YTA dude you absolutely fu*king suck. \nDo better.", "You're an insensitive jerk. YTA for making demeaning comments because of symptoms from your wife's medical condition.", "You're an ass who keeps trying to act like he's not being an ass by acting like an ass. It's pretty impressive. Yes YTA here. You shared something about HER when she's vulnerable. You didn't share it about yourself. But her. Of course YOU aren't embarrassed. You used her as a punchline. That was incredibly rude of you.", "Gently, but YTA.\n\nShes had to deal with a massive illness since she was young. You probably have no idea how hard that can be, and how many times she has wished for a more every day life as a young person.\n\nShe also gets up with the baby. \n\nIt sounds like she us a private person, and you joking about that probably made her feel sad and insecure about things she can't change. Shes also just had a baby and probably feels deeply unsexy after the natural change of pregnancy and after birth - so I'm sure she doesn't appreciate being likened to an old lady. Now more than ever, she needs to feel desired and appreciated by tou. When was the last time you told her ste was beautiful? Or hot? Or made her feel sexy? Probably a while ago. I get it, babies can mess things up.  It can take time to get into normal life again after a baby. But please dont spend that time making her feel eve  less desirable than she feels.\n\nIf she isnt happily joking about something herself, she probably wont appreciate YOU joking about it. If she thinks something is private, then dont air it in public.\n\nStoo making excuses and apologise for hurting her feelings.", "YTA for doubling down. I get that the first time was innocent but the moment she expressed hurt and insecurity over it, you needed to stop. Instead you did a fake apology and said it AGAIN. For whatever reason this joke hit a nerve. STOP SAYING IT. Do a real apology and tell her you finally realized that your joke really hurt her feelings and that was not your intention. \n\nThen if You really want to end this fight, find a cute selfie that she took of herself and that she posted somewhere else (that\u2019s how you know she likes it) and post in on social media and rave about her.\n\n\u201cLook at my amazing beautiful wife. She is the sweetest and most amazing person ever. I cannot imagine being with anyone as great as her, etc. \u201c\nMake it less generic than that obviously. And tag her.

Your friend's girl could be having nightmares/night terrors and that's what has her kicking.", "YTA\n\nSome things you just need to not say out loud. Your wife is a new mom whose body has been through it. She has a long road ahead of her, to recover body confidence and a sense of being a woman as well as a mom. Your quip undermined that.

Learn some discretion and tact, my dude.", "YTA you made fun of your wife\u2019s health issue to your friends. You don\u2019t seem remorseful at all. Do you help you wife with the baby at night? Or do you just complain about her keeping you up?", "YTA. First rule of being married, is never make fun of your wife to your friends", "YTA- first for the super pouty crack. She\u2019s not a child, you just said horrible things about your wife to your friends. Do you even like your wife? She\u2019s got a medical condition, asshole.", "Your poor wife! I think you've probably got the point that childbirth is physically hard on the body. Add to that the hormones that keep marching around, out of control, for many months after birth. Your wife probably feels like an old woman, some days. Last thing she needs is the one person, who should see her as a goddess, verbalising her worst thoughts. \nGo, apologise again, mean it this time.

Sharing any intimate details like this about any person who isn\u2019t you will always immediately make you TA.", "yta - she told you she was embarrassed by this comment and you still dismissed her feelings. not only is she diabetic but also is pregnant which is a massive change for her body, and instead of acknowledging that bit you mocked her and said she\u2019s like an old lady? it\u2019s only a joke when everyone, including your wife, finds it funny not just you and your friends.", "YTA.  It was a dickish thing to say and it hurt her feelings.  She obviously knows your apologies aren\u2019t sincere at all which is why she\u2019s still \u201cpouty\u201d.  And you are only calling her pouty because you don\u2019t give a crap that you hurt her feelings, which make you an AH.", "Yta. Should she piss herself so as not to offend your delicate sensibilities? She has a medical condition that she literally cannot help. Maybe you can get up for the baby next time so that your wife can sleep.", "YTA.\n\nI get you just wanted to add to the schtick with your buddies, but you don't joke about things that are caused by a medical condition or caused by them caring for a child. Doubly so if it's your partner and your child.", "YTA. Recovering from a baby is hard as is, but pelvic floor dysfunction is psychologically damaging for women. In addition to dealing with the getting up and down during the night, I'm sure your wife is wondering if her sexual experiences will ever be the same again or if you view her as \"damaged goods\".\n\nCongratulations, you probably just confirmed some of her worst fears, in front of others no less.\n\nEnjoy sleeping on the couch, because Lord knows that's where most women would have you sleeping from here on out.", "Yes YTA. Your wife just had a baby, she a disease that can be difficult to control, and you make a crass joke like that?! \n\nBig, very big YTA. You may not have meant to be one, but you sure were. Oh and because she keeps you awake. Have you ever thought about how much sleep she actually gets? How tired she must be? FFS, how inconsiderate can you be.", "Huge YTA, wow. Honestly, I could\u2019ve given you the benefit of the doubt if the apologies had actually been genuine, but the \u201cGoodnight grandpa\u201d part blew that entirely out of the water. \n\nI guess it doesn\u2019t matter what you say to someone, as long as you fake apologise twice first, that makes everything okay /s", "YTA. \n\nVery a h. \n\nYou told your friends she drools?\nAnd she\u2019s like sleeping with an old lady?", "Yta. She had a baby on top of her health condition and you're mocking her. That's not nice.

I hope you\u2019re not an abusive dad too.", "Minor YTA\n\nJust apologize and move on, it's not really that big of deal (especially not as big as the miserable redditors are making it sound) but it's deserving of an apology", "Minor YTA. You made a comment to join in and then instantly realized you couldn't explain your comment which likely made it weirder because what does sleeping next an old person mean? (my brain didn't jump to going to the bathroom).\n\nAlso apparently she's up for the baby at night also which means less sleep. Less sleep means more irritable.\n\nApologize profusely. Definitely don't minimize her feelings but this will blow over.", "Troll account alert.", "Does she know it was simply because of her getting up for the bathroom a lot? Because if my husband joked to his friends that it was like sleeping next to an old lady I would be so offended and hurt if i thought it was for another reason. My husband does make fun of me for getting up to pee all night because I do, especially while pregnant, but I laugh at that. Does she know specifically that's why it was said? If she does and is still upset by it then yeah you are a jerk for making fun of her about something she can't laugh at.", "Eeeeeh yeah Im pretty sure your postpartum wife did not appreciate that statement one bit. So you might be a tiny a-hole. In all fairness, I stopped sharing a bed with my partner YEARS ago. One I have insomnia so I am up late reading, doing online antique auctions, googling black holes....a little crazy. He on the other hand, snores so loud you can hear him from the yard of our apartment. And stops breathing. AND has crazy dreams where he wakes up cackling like a lunatic.

We have talked many things through, in our 30 years - key to a good marriage is communication, and we take ownership of things and sincerely apologize when we are wrong or when it\u2019s important for the relationship that someone apologizes - that\u2019s the key to a great relationship, putting the relationship over our ego\u2019s. \n\nI don\u2019t think there are any AH\u2019s here at all, I do think you need to sincerely apologize and hug your wife because she is a good wife and mother, she\u2019s been through a lot for your family and if you appreciate her it might just be time to be a hero for the relationship\u2026 \nCongratulations on your family \u2764\ufe0f", "Man, I feel like I'm going to hell, but I laughed.", "ESH. You for obvious reasons. She didn't appreciate the joke. Made it clear. You double down and still don't think you're wrong. She didn't like it. It's enough reason to apologize. \n\nHer because if she also makes jabs at your expense to her sister, she should expect you'd take that as tacit permission to do it as well. Since clearly she doesn't like it, now it's a great time to sit down and have a conversation about boundaries and what you both find funny. The fact that this hasn't happened is the actual issue. Communication people. It helps.", "NTA  she's being oversensitve here. I'm sure she talks to her friends about the little things that annoy her or she finds funny about you.", "I agree", "We have a split king so I don\u2019t wake up every time he goes to the bathroom and I do sleep next to an old man.  Your turns coming buddy!", "I second this. My spouse and I are still young, but frequent urination is a side effect of one of his medications so he always gets up once or twice per night. We have a simple memory foam mattress and topper and I barely notice if he got up most nights.", "Yup.   Rule #1: never make fun of your wife in front of your buddies.", "Exactly", "She was quite literally pouting.", "Exactly", "PERIOD", "I know it is not the same but my SO sometimes call me \"old woman\" because i have so many health issues (since the 20s, like my back snapped while trying to tickle him). But it is a joke between us and i give it back to him the same. He knows he doesn't hurt me with it because i always toke my disabilities with humour. He would NEVER talk like this in front of other, except i'm with him and say it first. That's a form of respect in my eyes. \n\nYTA", "he\u2019s absolutely TA, and him calling it a \u201cminor argument\u201d when his wife made him leave their bedroom says to me that he thinks less of it than his wife.

I've been type one since I was a baby and wouldn't be too hurt by a joke like this by someone I loved (although I'd rather they didn't say it to their friends) but it's clearly not up to me or OP to decide what hurts his wife. She's pregnant with a chronic illness (one which can complicate pregnancy). I'm reading too much into it now but OP is also the AH because he's bothered by his wife's high BGL making her get out of bed... when bad levels literally take time off your lifespan. Type one can cause you to die 20 years earlier than you otherwise would have. His wife is having a rough time with her chronic illness while pregnant and he's joking that she gets up to pee too much.", "Period", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

And your response was to offer fake apologies while invalidating her feelings. \n\nYou made it crystal clear to her that your apologies weren\u2019t sincere, and that you didn\u2019t care about her hurt feelings, by doubling down on the hurtful comment saying \u2018good night grandpa\u2019.", "And you're keeping score? Grow up dude. \n\nYTA. \n\nGive her a genuine apology and then give her some space. You should know better than to make your wife (especially your wife's SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITION that she can't control) the butt of any joke. And she's a new mom of a near 6month old. She's probably exhausted, her body is healing from a wrecking ball, and you're acting like a buffoon.

Of course she's up and down she's still healing she'll never be exactly as she was before pregnancy. \n\nHer bathroom trips are medical issues.

My boys are 7-10 and I STILL get up multiple times a night to pee, my husband he says \u201c man babe, that sucks I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \nI\u2019m not going to say YTA cuz I really think you were teasing and it was good natured. But her body just got destroyed, maybe she\u2019s not ready for good natured teasing yet! Just grovel man, she needs that. Good luck", "Honestly, I was kind of N-A-H. It felt like a misguided and insensitive, but something easily moved on from. If she could laugh about it with you, it would have been fine. But she wasn't okay with it.\n\nHowever, you doubled down and made the joke again after your supposed apologies?? You clearly never tried to show empathy or were remotely sorry. You were dismissive of something that she is understandably sensitive about.\n\nThis comment though, really pushed me over the edge. I love that you're suddenly a medical professional. \n\nNothing drives me battier than someone who is so wildly clueless about what a woman deals with post birth. Her pelvic floor is not healed yet! Of course it is still bad. Jesus. Childbirth is LITERALLY (proper use of that word), one of the most violent things that can happen to a woman's body. Just because it's common, doesn't mean it isn't a severe trauma to the body. Because it is. \n\nGet clued in and apologize. Properly.\n\nYTA", "And?? Do you think that's relevant?? Lol", "This is a dealbreaker and she should leave you\n\nYTA", "Which is why I apologised, I apologised twice and both were ignored.", "Right? Like I've never even been pregnant, but I have a lot of medical problems, including some bladder issues. I pee a ton, including waking up 2-3 times a night most nights. It sucks. I'd really love to just have an uninterrupted nignts sleep. Sometimes I make jokes about my bladder. But it would really hurt my feelings if my SO made fun of me for something I couldn't control.

Your apologies were insincere, which is probably why they were ignored.", "Because they were 100% NOT sincere apologies based on how you presented your story here.

That's not an apology.", "well yeah, cause they were insincere because you clearly don\u2019t care and don\u2019t think you did anything wrong, hence doubling down and joking about it even more in your post", "I\u2019m glad that she\u2019s ignoring you I would too asshole", "You made excuses for yourself, which tends to undermine an apology", "And then doubled down.

You basically were saying I'm sorry, but I'm still right, and you should feel sorry for me. Well, I'm sorry, but you're not the one who had to carry a baby for nine months and give birth. While diabetic which makes it far more difficult and frightening. You're not the one who is still recovering from pregnancy and birth. A woman's body doesn't immediately bounce back after the baby's out and having a condition like diabetes can make the recovery process longer and more difficult. Add the fact that, unless she's able to sleepwalk to the bathroom, she's getting even less sleep than you.

Once you apologize for something you can\u2019t do the thing over again. That\u2019s what makes YTA in my book.", "Because you didn't mean it, you're not sorry for hurting her, you're sorry for the consequences", "There are some really good pelvic floor videos on YT that might help. I actually saw a physical therapist for mine and the difference was WOW. Might be worth a quick chat with your doc for a referral.", "He didn't need to say what he said to his friends period.
