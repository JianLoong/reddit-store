How far did the dog have to go?", "So let me get this right. You are headed to go indoors where dogs aren\u2019t allowed, but get held up on the patio where dogs are allowed. While standing near a table, held up, a dog acted like a dog and sniffed you. And you decide to be a rude asshole? Yeah YTA. If you don\u2019t like dogs fine, whatever.  But the dog was where it was allowed and you were held up in its space. Chill the fuck out", "**YTA** - this is an overreaction to a dog coming up and sniffing your ankles.

Better to be polite but firm.  \n\nIf the dog jumps on you or a child, it's a whole other story.", "NTA. \"I'm not friendly\" is only mildly rude but I don't think it's inappropriate.

I don't want it in my fucking space.\u00a0 \u00a0\n> They seem baffled that someone didn't like their dog.\u00a0 He called me an asshole and told me to find somewhere else to walk.\u00a0 I say fuck off as we head to our table.\n\nYeah, OP is the one who said fuck off, and it's kind of unclear, but if they said \"I don't want your dog in my fucking space\" it's even more clear.", "Well still he has the right to be mad if there  immediately  going to call a curse word.", "And then OP told them to eff off. Its a vicious cycle, that he started.", "Dog friendly doesn\u2019t mean your dog leaves you and invades others space.", "Yes, let's train the dog not to smell strangers and the owners shouldn't be letting it in other people's personal space without permission.", "1000000% \ud83d\ude02", "It says the dog was sniffing his ankles. That means the owner was letting the dog sniff people.", "Doesn't mean that dog knows", "Did we read the same post? The only person in this story who immediately cursed at anyone is OP. There is no mention of any colorful language from the dog owner until the very last paragraph.", "The dog owners being bad owners started it.", "Did that happen? OP hasnt clarified - all we know is OP went to a dog friendly space and the dog \u201cgot up\u201d and sniffed him. \n\nThis is very vague.", "Dogs sniff. Was the dog touching OP or just sniffing? \n\nBut yeah, dogs sniff everything"]}
