{"id": 4844, "submission_id": "zn79o2", "title": "AITA for no longer responding to my friend\u2018s medical emergencies?", "selftext": "I (30F) have been friends with my friend Mary (27F) for roughly 5 years. We\u2019re completely different people who met at work and somehow became pretty close friends. \n\nThree years into our friendship, Mary started becoming sick. No one really knew what was going on, but it all escalated into her passing out at work and needing ambulance to get to a hospital. I could sense she was scared because she didn\u2019t know what was wrong with her. I took it extremely serious and stood by her side through it all. Whenever she texted or called me because of her medical emergency, aka her being scared to collapse or faint randomly, I\u2019d immediately answer and go see her. I spent many days by her side and often spent all day accompanying her until her husband or a direct family member took over. \n\nThis all went on for roughly a year, until she was finally diagnosed with severe anxiety and a panic disorder. She did get it treated through therapy and returned to a new \u201cnormal\u201d, being able to do things alone again. \nIn the meantime, my life had changed drastically, I found a new job, met my now husband, and we moved into our own place. Naturally, we hadn\u2019t seen and spoken much during that time because I was so busy.\n\nAnyway, I found out that Mary\u2019s condition had gotten worse recently when she called me in the middle of the night, asking me to accompany her until her husband would be back from work. I did go to see her and upon asking her why therapy was no longer helping, she claimed she quit therapy because she wanted to \u201cget through it on her own\u201d. I asked her if her family knew but she said she didn\u2019t want to worry them, so they don\u2019t know. Her husband knows. \n\nWell, her calls became more frequent again. But this time, it was hard for me to just leave everything and be there for her. At first I was there for her again, but with time, I just didn\u2019t have the energy to do so anymore. Her requests became irrational and more demanding. And while I have sympathy for her and her condition, I see no point in putting up with it if she\u2019s refusing proper medical help, let alone help from her immediate family. I started making up excuses why I couldn\u2019t help her at certain times.\n\nIt all boiled down to last thursday, where I got a message from her at 4 AM, asking me to take her to her parents place because she was having a \u201cmedical emergency\u201d. I saw the message but I ignored because I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. In fact, I ghosted her and went back to sleep. The next day I pretended to have slept through her text and found out she had managed to stay at home until her husband got there, but she didn\u2019t fail to make me feel bad for ignoring her messages. She\u2019s giving me the cold shoulder since. I know she\u2019s mad I didn\u2019t answer or help her when she needed me.  I do feel guilty but I thought if it really was an emergency she could call an ambulance.

She's asking you to continue enabling her choice to not seek therapy and more appropriate help. You are allowed to set boundaries and you *should* set boundaries on this. She's already shown she's only going to get increasingly more demanding. And while we all love our friends and should be there to help them, you likely aren't trained to deal with this. You aren't the best person to be helping her, and your job as a friend is to be her friend, not her makeshift therapist.", "NTA at all!! So many people feel so entitled to make their medical problems other people\u2019s responsibilities whether it may be mental or physical. I also do sympathize with Mary and I understand how much you have tried to help, but she needs to understand that you are not her on-call care taker. If she wants that, then she needs to look into a professional or a consenting adult that is okay with playing such a role. Clearly you have started to put up your boundaries and I commend you for that.\n\nShe isn\u2019t thinking about how this can affect your own physical and mental health as well as those around you like your husband and potential/future pets and children. I would suggest just having a conversation with her about it and explaining how you are simply not capable of playing this role for her - although you want to be a part of her life and support her, you cannot be who she calls every time.", "NTA. To actively give up on a method that was working at getting her better is ridiculously stupid. Now she could be lying about:\n\n>she claimed she quit therapy because she wanted to \u201cget through it on her own\u201d.\n\nAnd she might have had to stop due to financial reasons, pressure from her husband or something else. If that's the case it's a sad situation for her, but you aren't the cause so you don't owe her any of your time.

She is using you as a scapegoat since she has no one else to blame her problems on, and now this is her use for you. Nothing more. You are not a source of comfort for this woman. She wants someone to buy her victim story and to play the blame game when they refuse to comply.\n\nI would suggest you go fully no contact. She is a very abusive person by giving you the cold shoulder the one time you wouldn\u2019t be at her beck and call, and that says a lot more about her and her \u201ccondition\u201d than what she says about herself.\n\nI firmly believe this woman has a serious mental illness.

If she was properly seeking treatment and it was genuinely not working, I'm sure that you would've still gone and helped her. You have done so much more than most people would, and the fact you really needed a break does not make you an asshole.   \nShe needs to realize that she is risking YOUR mental health by not trying to get help for HER mental health, and maybe that is what you need to tell her in order to get it across to her.", "NTA. When you decide to ignore your doctor, you can't keep crying wolf. You need to talk to her and let her know you can't help her if she refuses to follow her treatment plan.

You\u2019re doing ur best, set clear boundaries focus on your stress response to situations and your capacity for emotional energy used to help friends, that you do still care. you can try the \u201cspoons\u201d analogy to get through to her. (sometiems ppl that feel victimized by an illness forget that neurotypical ppl also have emotional thresholds as well) even set a boundary bordering on ultimatum, that she needs to go back in therapy because you\u2019ve noticed her decline and relying more on u since going freestyle. and that there\u2019s no shame in needing help. might not get through the first time. it\u2019s incredibly frustrating, heartbreaking, etc when a loved one refuses treatment :( alternatively, it\u2019s very disempowering to admit you need professional help to live a normal life, feelings, thoughts, like the very basics of being a human are taken from you. her diagnosis is still relatively new in the sense of fluctuating up and down before she settles on a solution, hopefully productive/positive. Got to be assertive and gentle, but sticking it out means the world if you\u2019re up to some growing pains while redefining /enforcing boundaries.", "NTA!!! I think it's evident your friend wouldn't do the same for you, since it's very clear she has 0 regard for your own needs/wants/entire life. I would seriously recommend cutting her out of your life. Maybe just drop a: \"I appreciate the friendship we've shared, but this relationship is very one-sided and, because my life is busier now, I've chosen to only make time for friendships that are genuine. Wish you the best.\" and block + delete on social media. But she also kind of sounds like a crazy (NOT bc of her mental health struggles) unpredictable narcissist, so perhaps just going straight for the block + delete is best.", "NTA / she should go back to therapy if it\u2019s this bad.", "NTA, but you should tell her straight up that her decision to abandon therapy necessarily means she'll need more help from you.  And that's not considerate for you- it's basically saying she expects you to upend your life at 4am because she doesn't want to stick with therapy.  Tell her if she's in therapy and doing everything she can from her side, you will do everything you can and help her as much as you are able.  But if she's not doing her side of things, if she's not in therapy, you don't think it's right for you to be expected to keep supporting her at the expense of your life and sleep.", "NTA.\n\nTell her that you love her and want the best for her, but that you can't help her anymore until she makes the choice to help herself because it sounds like it's beginning to affect your mental health now, too.", "Soft YTA because it shouldn't be asked of you to help so much... but all this could be avoided by having a honest conversation instead of letting things fester. You are not handling this well and this is helping none of you individually, on top of threatening the friendship. You need to tell her that you lack the resources to help her as much as you used to, and that you think she needs more help than you can provide. For both of your sake she needs to understand that this is not working out.\nThis being said I also don't see a real conflict here, as she has not openly blamed you for anything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We had exactly zero things in common, but I was naive and hellbent on being a good person, and she was freshly single and hellbent on hyperfixating on someone else.

When I finally realized that she was using me, whether or not it was intentional, I distanced myself until we were no longer speaking, and it was honestly a relief.\n\nI know that sounds cruel, but people who haven't experienced this phenomenon first-hand won't understand.

The ghosting was a bit of an asshole move, even though I understand where you're coming from. But Mary does not, she is sick and needs professional help.  I would tell Mary to get back into therapy, and to not call me until she is. Don't lie about it, there is nothing gained by it.", "NTA\n\nBut... I would ask why she really stopped.  Some people stop therapy for reasons they don't want to talk about.  It wasn't working, can't afford it, etc. And i know, I know she gave you a reason but it could be a bs excuse.  \n\n\nOther than that,  I think you need to set boundaries as the time goes on.

Boundaries are important, but if in the past you were happy to do it and now things have changed, maybe you could explain all this to Mary and set boundaries on when you might be able to help her, but make it clear that you can't be around 24/7 like in the past. It doesn't have to be the end of the friendship, but it really depends on how both of you respond to the situation. You shouldn't feel guilty though.

She reminds me of my sibling with borderline personality disorder. Through a lot of therapy we\u2019ve managed. I did the same as you and eventually stopped taking the late night calls always. Suicide was a risk, but they had other people and other resources through therapy. They know they can call me and I\u2019ll answer when reasonable to me and a text being like emergency please answer will get a response usually, but therapy got them to respect my boundaries and autonomy.

ETA.", "This!", "I have two partners (I am polyam) and I am chronically ill and have PTSD.\n\nMaybe because it was the Covid times but when I had medical emergencies I did not expect them to drop everything when I was also doing bugger all to manage it. I did triage it that while I had 20 hospital admissions in under two years, the only times I had them on \u2018standby\u2019 was when I needed potential next of kin intervention and to potentially say goodbye as some were life threatening. Other times I let them know \u2018back in hospital/they made me get an ambulance/latest update.\u2019\n\nI had appenditicitis that mutated into perforation, sepsis, a collapsed lung and then a pulmonary embolism. So some \u2018you have minutes\u2019 emergencies where eh, not much time to call and then some \u2018feels an emergency\u2019 because my PTSD worsened to the point of having dissociative episodes that left me paralysed and that EMTs and doctors could not be sure weren\u2019t more embolisms without diagnostics. Those were actually way scarier for me than knowing I had sepsis. So I appreciate mental health admissions can be deeply distressing and not a linear physical vs mental health thing.\n\nBut she stopped managing her condition, you aren\u2019t her family or partner, you didn\u2019t consent to such a responsibility such as saying \u2018oh put me as ICE person\u2019 and she has literal professionals there and is ill but capable of basically arguing with you which suggests a different dynamic than she is trying to claim.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m an outlier but in those medical emergencies I mentioned I could barely text and keep up and on the one occasion re Covid my partners were with me, I was so unwell and overwhelmed I could barely speak to them or staff let alone start debates. I was then making some hard to follow chats or acts because I had huge amounts of opiates and was a snappy AH at one point (a long point\u2026)\n\nThere were definitely moments where others worried because they wanted to be there, times I stressed them by insisting I was fine, bits where I manipulated how much I told them to not have them panic before I knew more and where I royally fucked up not letting them make decisions and \u2018manipulated\u2019 out of trying to be less of a bother and ended up being a hassle. Because crises and emergencies are inherently chaotic and unpredictable and you can\u2019t tell how you or others will react. In my book if you have capacity to be in pick an emotion not survival your emotions pick you that is a medical event more akin to appointments, taking or refusing medication and guilt tripping that is is an emergency is manipulation in itself.\n\nIf you are chronically ill it is unlikely people will always be able to attend every medical demand whether ER visit, appointment or symptom management and nor should they. It isn\u2019t your fault but it is your responsibility and you have to use coping strategies from self advocating to professional help to boundaries or it can easily fall into people weaponising their conditions. Sadly this is more common than society would like to admit and very hard to withstand without looking or feeling guilty.\n\nMy therapist reminded me that as a chronically ill person who meets many other ill people I needed to think of it like first aid. Do I know how to do it safely? Because me trying to give first aid badly is worse than calling first responders and it was ok to stop feeling guilty about being asked and not knowing or being able to give CPR. It was fine and indeed best to know my limits and hand it to someone who did and help later if I could.\n\nBut you can\u2019t help people who don\u2019t want help but attention. That gets into enabling. I\u2019ve had over 100 ER visits in my life. I cannot imagine expecting people to drop stuff every time. My health is like a full time job for me. No one is a sub contractor! NTA.", "I have a long time a friend I've known for 35 years. At some point he became a binge drinking alcoholic. I don't know if there is any particular underlying cause but I do know that he has been offered help many times from family and friends, been to rehab that taught moderation versus abstinence, burned many bridges with family and friends, etc. He has this sense of entitlement and feels the world owes him. But he's not willing to get the treatment he needs so that he can be a functioning, responsible adult.\n\nI have helped him many times, accepting his phone calls in the middle of the night to hear him wallow about wanting to end his life, knowing full well that it was a call for attention. I gave him a job and a place to stay. The job lasted a week and I had to kick him out after 3 weeks because he was drunk for the last two. \n\nOver the years, I've dealt with fairly severe depression, severe ADHD, trying to run my business and a mother who is in the early stages of Alzheimer's. There came a point when my helping him was having a negative effect on my own life. I stopped answering his phone calls in the middle of the night, I had to cut his phone calls short when they were in the middle of a work day, I stopped hanging out with him. I explained numerous times that I could not help him if it was going to have a negative effect on my own life. \n\nThis last summer was our 30 year high school reunion. I had zero interest in going as I've got way too much stuff on my plate and stress is taking its toll. He kept bugging me about it to the point that I told him I would no longer take his calls if he mentioned it again. He did so I ignored the call and sent him a scathing email telling him that if he wish to talk with me, it had to be in writing. His behavior was having a serious negative effect on my mental health. I haven't talked to him for a few months and while I'm still seriously stressed, I am less so without him constantly adding to it.\n\nSo to wrap this up, let her know that the type of help she wants is having a serious negative effect on your life you are not willing to compromise your mental health for her. If she can't understand that, your friendship has probably run its course.", "Just want to add to this that you would not only enable her but you'd be compromizing your own health. I have been in a situation where I could not turn off my phone at night just in case, and I didn't have a decent night's sleep for 3 years. \n\nYou need to take care of you. \n\nShe needs to get back to therapy because she's not getting through it by herself.", "NTA she\u2019s neither your child nor partner.

Her expectation that you are to be frequently available for emergencies sounds like a decision that she made on her own. It is perfectly reasonable for you to tell her that while you sympathize with her condition, it is starting to negatively affect you (mentally or otherwise). You have to decide for yourself what is reasonable. It's clear that you are a giving and caring person, and like to think of yourself this way. But you are allowed to set your own boundaries with her. You can tell her that you just don't have the capacity to disrupt your sleep on a regular basis or drop everything. Also, you don't really have to give her a reason for this, either! \n\nTo put it differently, your friendship with her should not be based on whether you are available to her as free emergency medical transport. \n\nAlso, it is your choice to decide how you spend your time and energy. Time and energy spent toward helping a friend is a good and noble thing. But it should be your choice to do it. If you made the commitment to begin with, you should follow through or come clean why you can't. But it sounds like you didn't \"opt in\". If you do decide to dedicate yourself to her care, it takes away from time and energy you could be spending on other things of your choosing: time and energy spent on your relationship, your family, your career, your hobbies, other friends, helping other people and neighbors, etc etc. In the end, it should be your choice where you put your energy, and where you have committed to putting your efforts. \n\nIt would be a very positive thing if you could have an open discussion about this with your friend. That is: you want to be there for her, but you need to set boundaries for your own well-being. It also sounds really unfair to you that she is leaning on you (and worrying you) and keeping this from her family. That is not your choice to inform her family, but if it were me, it would irk me quite a bit!

For months and months at 3:30 am I woke up hyperventilating, after which I began counting the states on my fingers while visualing their location on a map.  \n\nAnd it worked, it enabled me to regain control. (Plus, as  an added bonus, I now have a cool party trick of being able to recite all 50 US states in less than 30 seconds. lol) \n\nThen my panic attacks started happening during the day. Having already memorized the states, simply reciting them didn't work. I ended up in the ER where I was incidentally diagnosed with diabetes, they had no clue as to what was going on mentally. I saw an internist who began treatment for diabetes and also diagnosed me with clinical depression, something which went hand in hand with what I finally learned were panic attacks.

She\u2019s not getting that on her own and everything\u2019s is escalating. \n\nYour going to feel guilty but you absolutely Need to set some boundaries and ween her off of you. \n\nExtreme caution is needed as this is very similar behaviour that presents itself in abusive domestic relationships.

As someone who has severe anxiety, panic disorder OCD and depression, I feel for your friend but it's not fair to you for her to be so dependent on you. She clearly needs more help than you are capable of giving her. I'd put some distance between you two and tell her that it's too much for you to be there every time she has an \"emergency\" and she needs to get back into therapy.", "NTA. First of all, no one owes anyone medical support of any kind. I have a chronic illness, so that's terrifying to say, but it's true.

Also, using you as a crutch instead of going to therapy is not her \"dealing with it own her own\".", "NTA. I say this as someone with multiple disabling mental illnesses. You are not responsible for her mental health. She will not get better unless she\u2019s putting in the work and she has to choose that for herself. She has the resources. She\u2019s choosing not to use them. Being mentally ill does not excuse emotional manipulation. In fact mental illness with inadequate treatment can make you extra manipulative.

I definitely wouldn\u2019t call that ghosting.", "NTA\n\nTake the cold shoulder as a blessing and stop talking to her. She didn\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d you. She wanted you. There\u2019s a difference.

If he can\u2019t, she can call her family. You are not a comfort keeper, you are not an emotional support animal. She has treatment options and decided to let them lapse. She is purposely putting herself in harms way to get your attention and I\u2019m sure to punish you for being too busy. This lady is not your friend. She may have started out as such but those days are over. Tell her she needs to go back to therapy and you two can function as normal friends during the day who equally give to the friendship. If she is refusing help, she needs to reach out to her family.", "NTA. Doing the work in therapy would help her learn to get through it.

He\u2019s working two jobs and the last time I saw him he looked completely lost. I felt bad for him. If it\u2019s tiring for me, I can\u2019t imagine what he must be going through. I told her she needs therapy, she agreed that therapy helped but she\u2019s refusing to go back because she really believes she can cure herself. I have yet to figure out why she\u2019s so adamant about it.", "Wow. Thank you so much for telling your story. I respect you for being so level-headed and rational through all you have to go through. Thank you also for your opinion on the situation.  You\u2019re right, it\u2019s shaped itself into me enabling her behaviour.

But she won\u2019t take the steps to make it better. The only thing that worked was therapy but for some reason she\u2019s not going back. Maybe because she  feels it failed because she went there for a while and the disorder came back as soon as she stopped?

I call that a win", "NTA. \n\nAlso consider what kind of friendship you want going forward. Cutting them out completely is valid. If you do want to keep them as a friend, you need to do an in depth audit of your resources to sustainable be supportive. \n\nFigure out what you have available to offer them in an ongoing basis that won't burn you out.

Everyone deserves healthy boundaries and a friend who is willing to meet them halfway, not demand your help or berate you for not helping. Caregivers and home health aid services are available, as well as anxiety help lines and anxiety help forums online. There is so much help available now in almost every city and everywhere online. If OP were to stop answering her requests for help, it is most likely that it will force her to look for appropriate help at least online or via phone help lines.

I didn't mind any of that, it was helping and I could see the benefit of her doing these things, she was trying her best to help herself and just needed support. Until I would get calls at stupid times becuase she missed the bus, or didn't want to walk home or pay for a taxi. Related to her mental health or not I felt used and my time, sleep, plans and life were less important than hers. \n\nThere's a line between needing support that benefits your friend, and her just being selfish. Whether that's on purpose or not she needs to grow up a little. She shouldn't be giving you the silent treatment because you prioritized yourself.

But you need to sit her down and have a frank conversation with her. You have to tell her that clearly doing it on her own isn't working.

It's taking a toll on your mental health. If she attacks you, than it's obvious she isn't a true friend. Tell her that as well. Call her on her bullshit.
