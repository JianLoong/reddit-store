{"id": 4844, "submission_id": "zn79o2", "title": "AITA for no longer responding to my friend\u2018s medical emergencies?", "selftext": "I (30F) have been friends with my friend Mary (27F) for roughly 5 years. We\u2019re completely different people who met at work and somehow became pretty close friends. \n\nThree years into our friendship, Mary started becoming sick. No one really knew what was going on, but it all escalated into her passing out at work and needing ambulance to get to a hospital. I could sense she was scared because she didn\u2019t know what was wrong with her. I took it extremely serious and stood by her side through it all. Whenever she texted or called me because of her medical emergency, aka her being scared to collapse or faint randomly, I\u2019d immediately answer and go see her. I spent many days by her side and often spent all day accompanying her until her husband or a direct family member took over. \n\nThis all went on for roughly a year, until she was finally diagnosed with severe anxiety and a panic disorder. She did get it treated through therapy and returned to a new \u201cnormal\u201d, being able to do things alone again. \nIn the meantime, my life had changed drastically, I found a new job, met my now husband, and we moved into our own place. Naturally, we hadn\u2019t seen and spoken much during that time because I was so busy.\n\nAnyway, I found out that Mary\u2019s condition had gotten worse recently when she called me in the middle of the night, asking me to accompany her until her husband would be back from work. I did go to see her and upon asking her why therapy was no longer helping, she claimed she quit therapy because she wanted to \u201cget through it on her own\u201d. I asked her if her family knew but she said she didn\u2019t want to worry them, so they don\u2019t know. Her husband knows. \n\nWell, her calls became more frequent again. But this time, it was hard for me to just leave everything and be there for her. At first I was there for her again, but with time, I just didn\u2019t have the energy to do so anymore. Her requests became irrational and more demanding. And while I have sympathy for her and her condition, I see no point in putting up with it if she\u2019s refusing proper medical help, let alone help from her immediate family. I started making up excuses why I couldn\u2019t help her at certain times.\n\nIt all boiled down to last thursday, where I got a message from her at 4 AM, asking me to take her to her parents place because she was having a \u201cmedical emergency\u201d. I saw the message but I ignored because I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. In fact, I ghosted her and went back to sleep. The next day I pretended to have slept through her text and found out she had managed to stay at home until her husband got there, but she didn\u2019t fail to make me feel bad for ignoring her messages. She\u2019s giving me the cold shoulder since. I know she\u2019s mad I didn\u2019t answer or help her when she needed me.  I do feel guilty but I thought if it really was an emergency she could call an ambulance.

She's asking you to continue enabling her choice to not seek therapy and more appropriate help. You are allowed to set boundaries and you *should* set boundaries on this. She's already shown she's only going to get increasingly more demanding. And while we all love our friends and should be there to help them, you likely aren't trained to deal with this.

So many people feel so entitled to make their medical problems other people\u2019s responsibilities whether it may be mental or physical. I also do sympathize with Mary and I understand how much you have tried to help, but she needs to understand that you are not her on call care taker. If she wants that, then she needs to look into a professional or a consenting adult that is okay with playing that role. Clearly you have started to put up your boundaries and I commend you for that.\n\nShe isn\u2019t thinking about how this can affect your own physical and mental health as well as those around you like your husband and potential/future pets and children. I would suggest just having a conversation with her about it and how you are not capable of playing this role for her, and although you want to be a part of her life and support her, you cannot be who she calls every time.", "NTA. To actively give up on a method that was working at getting her better is ridiculously stupid. Now she could be lying about:\n\n>she claimed she quit therapy because she wanted to \u201cget through it on her own\u201d.\n\nAnd she might have had to stop due to financial reasons, pressure from her husband or something else. If that's the case it's a sad situation for her, but you aren't the cause so you don't owe her any of your time.

She is using you as a scapegoat since she has no one else to blame her problems on, and now this is her use for you. Nothing more. You are not a source of comfort for this woman. She wants someone to buy her victim story and to play the blame game when they refuse to comply.\n\nI would suggest you go fully no contact. She is a very abusive person by giving you the cold shoulder the one time you wouldn\u2019t be at her beck and call, and that says a lot more about her and her \u201ccondition\u201d than what she says about herself.\n\nI firmly believe this woman has a serious mental illness.

If she was properly seeking treatment and it was genuinely not working, I'm sure that you would've still gone and helped her. You have done so much more than most people would, and the fact you really needed a break does not make you an asshole.   \nShe needs to realize that she is risking YOUR mental health by not trying to get help for HER mental health, and maybe that is what you need to tell her in order to get it across to her.", "NTA. When you decide to ignore your doctor, you can't keep crying wolf. You need to talk to her and let her know you can't help her if she refuses to follow her treatment plan.

You\u2019re doing ur best, set clear boundaries focus on your stress response to situations and your capacity for emotional energy used to help friends, that you do still care. you can try the \u201cspoons\u201d analogy to get through to her. (sometiems ppl that feel victimized by an illness forget that neurotypical ppl also have emotional thresholds as well) even set a boundary bordering on ultimatum, that she needs to go back in therapy because you\u2019ve noticed her decline and relying more on u since going freestyle. and that there\u2019s no shame in needing help. might not get through the first time. it\u2019s incredibly frustrating, heartbreaking, etc when a loved one refuses treatment :( alternatively, it\u2019s very disempowering to admit you need professional help to live a normal life, feelings, thoughts, like the very basics of being a human are taken from you. her diagnosis is still relatively new in the sense of fluctuating up and down before she settles on a solution, hopefully productive/positive. Got to be assertive and gentle, but sticking it out means the world if you\u2019re up to some growing pains while redefining /enforcing boundaries.", "NTA!!! I think it's evident your friend wouldn't do the same for you, since it's very clear she has 0 regard for your own needs/wants/entire life. I would seriously recommend cutting her out of your life. Maybe just drop a: \"I appreciate the friendship we've shared, but this relationship is very one-sided and, because my life is busier now, I've chosen to only make time for friendships that are genuine. Wish you the best.\" and block + delete on social media. But she also kind of sounds like a crazy (NOT bc of her mental health struggles) unpredictable narcissist, so perhaps just going straight for the block + delete is best.", "NTA / she should go back to therapy if it\u2019s this bad.", "NTA, but you should tell her straight up that her decision to abandon therapy necessarily means she'll need more help from you.  And that's not considerate for you- it's basically saying she expects you to upend your life at 4am because she doesn't want to stick with therapy.  Tell her if she's in therapy and doing everything she can from her side, you will do everything you can and help her as much as you are able.  But if she's not doing her side of things, if she's not in therapy, you don't think it's right for you to be expected to keep supporting her at the expense of your life and sleep.", "NTA.\n\nTell her that you love her and want the best for her, but that you can't help her anymore until she makes the choice to help herself because it sounds like it's beginning to affect your mental health now, too.", "Soft YTA because it shouldn't be asked of you to help so much... but all this could be avoided by having a honest conversation instead of letting things fester. You are not handling this well and this is helping none of you individually, on top of threatening the friendship. You need to tell her that you lack the resources to help her as much as you used to, and that you think she needs more help than you can provide. For both of your sake she needs to understand that this is not working out.\nThis being said I also don't see a real conflict here, as she has not openly blamed you for anything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We had exactly zero things in common, but I was naive and hellbent on being a good person, and she was freshly single and hellbent on hyperfixating on someone else. She was always in crisis and always leaned on me to be her only pillar of support, to an extent that it became obsessive. When I finally realized that she was using me, whether or not it was intentional, I distanced myself until we were no longer speaking, and it was honestly a relief.\n\nI know that sounds cruel, but people who haven't experienced this phenomenon first-hand won't understand.

The ghosting was a bit of an asshole move, even though I understand where you're coming from. But Mary does not, she is sick and needs professional help.  I would tell Mary to get back into therapy, and to not call me until she is. Don't lie about it, there is nothing gained by it.", "NTA\n\nBut... I would ask why she really stopped.  Some people stop therapy for reasons they don't want to talk about.  It wasn't working, can't afford it, etc. And i know, I know she gave you a reason but it could be a bs excuse.  \n\n\nOther than that,  I think you need to set boundaries as the time goes on.

After that it's up to her to act accordingly.", "NTA, did Mary save your life at some point or why have you put up with this nonsense this long?", "NTA. Boundaries are important, but if in the past you were happy to do it and now things have changed, maybe you could explain all this to Mary and set boundaries on when you might be able to help her, but make it clear that you can't be around 24/7 like in the past. It doesn't have to be the end of the friendship, but it really depends on how both of you respond to the situation. You shouldn't feel guilty though.

She reminds me of my sibling with borderline personality disorder. Through a lot of therapy we\u2019ve managed. I did the same as you and eventually stopped taking the late night calls always. Suicide was a risk, but they had other people and other resources through therapy. They know they can call me and I\u2019ll answer when reasonable to me and a text being like emergency please answer will get a response usually, but therapy got them to respect my boundaries and autonomy.

She\u2019s made big financial decisions recently by starting a new business, but I don\u2019t know\u2026. I think investing into a new business shouldn\u2019t be put above her mental health. She should be investing in therapy instead. But that\u2019s just my opinion. It\u2019s true, even if she can\u2019t afford it right now, it\u2019s not okay for her to guilt me. I just needed to hear (or in this case: read) it. So thank you.", "Yes, this! OP if Mary gives you \"the silent treatment\", take it with both hands and run off like a bandit!!

NTA.", "This!", "I have two partners (I am polyam) and I am chronically ill and have PTSD.\n\nMaybe because it was the Covid times but when I had medical emergencies I did not expect them to drop everything when I was also doing bugger all to manage it. I did triage it that while I had 20 hospital admissions in under two years, the only times I had them on \u2018standby\u2019 was when I needed potential next of kin intervention and to potentially say goodbye as some were life threatening. Other times I let them know \u2018back in hospital/they made me get an ambulance/latest update.\u2019\n\nI had appenditicitis that mutated into perforation, sepsis, a collapsed lung and then a pulmonary embolism. So some \u2018you have minutes\u2019 emergencies where eh, not much time to call and then some \u2018feels an emergency\u2019 because my PTSD worsened to the point of having dissociative episodes that left me paralysed and that EMTs and doctors could not be sure weren\u2019t more embolisms without diagnostics. Those were actually way scarier for me than knowing I had sepsis. So I appreciate mental health admissions can be deeply distressing and not a linear physical vs mental health thing.\n\nBut she stopped managing her condition, you aren\u2019t her family or partner, you didn\u2019t consent to such a responsibility such as saying \u2018oh put me as ICE person\u2019 and she has literal professionals there and is ill but capable of basically arguing with you which suggests a different dynamic than she is trying to claim.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m an outlier but in those medical emergencies I mentioned I could barely text and keep up and on the one occasion re Covid my partners were with me, I was so unwell and overwhelmed I could barely speak to them or staff let alone start debates. I was then making some hard to follow chats or acts because I had huge amounts of opiates and was a snappy AH at one point (a long point\u2026)\n\nThere were definitely moments where others worried because they wanted to be there, times I stressed them by insisting I was fine, bits where I manipulated how much I told them to not have them panic before I knew more and where I royally fucked up not letting them make decisions and \u2018manipulated\u2019 out of trying to be less of a bother and ended up being a hassle. Because crises and emergencies are inherently chaotic and unpredictable and you can\u2019t tell how you or others will react. In my book if you have capacity to be in pick an emotion not survival your emotions pick you that is a medical event more akin to appointments, taking or refusing medication and guilt tripping that is is an emergency is manipulation in itself.\n\nIf you are chronically ill it is unlikely people will always be able to attend every medical demand whether ER visit, appointment or symptom management and nor should they. It isn\u2019t your fault but it is your responsibility and you have to use coping strategies from self advocating to professional help to boundaries or it can easily fall into people weaponising their conditions. Sadly this is more common than society would like to admit and very hard to withstand without looking or feeling guilty.\n\nMy therapist reminded me that as a chronically ill person who meets many other ill people I needed to think of it like first aid. Do I know how to do it safely? Because me trying to give first aid badly is worse than calling first responders and it was ok to stop feeling guilty about being asked and not knowing or being able to give CPR. It was fine and indeed best to know my limits and hand it to someone who did and help later if I could.\n\nBut you can\u2019t help people who don\u2019t want help but attention. That gets into enabling. I\u2019ve had over 100 ER visits in my life. I cannot imagine expecting people to drop stuff every time. My health is like a full time job for me. No one is a sub contractor! NTA.", "I have a long time a friend I've known for 35 years. At some point he became a binge drinking alcoholic. I don't know if there is any particular underlying cause but I do know that he has been offered help many times from family and friends, been to rehab that taught moderation versus abstinence, burned many bridges with family and friends, etc. He has this sense of entitlement and feels the world owes him. But he's not willing to get the treatment he needs so that he can be a functioning, responsible adult.\n\nI have helped him many times, accepting his phone calls in the middle of the night to hear him wallow about wanting to end his life, knowing full well that it was a call for attention. I gave him a job and a place to stay. The job lasted a week and I had to kick him out after 3 weeks because he was drunk for the last two. \n\nOver the years, I've dealt with fairly severe depression, severe ADHD, trying to run my business and a mother who is in the early stages of Alzheimer's. There came a point when my helping him was having a negative effect on my own life. I stopped answering his phone calls in the middle of the night, I had to cut his phone calls short when they were in the middle of a work day, I stopped hanging out with him. I explained numerous times that I could not help him if it was going to have a negative effect on my own life. \n\nThis last summer was our 30 year high school reunion. I had zero interest in going as I've got way too much stuff on my plate and stress is taking its toll. He kept bugging me about it to the point that I told him I would no longer take his calls if he mentioned it again. He did so I ignored the call and sent him a scathing email telling him that if he wish to talk with me, it had to be in writing. His behavior was having a serious negative effect on my mental health. I haven't talked to him for a few months and while I'm still seriously stressed, I am less so without him constantly adding to it.\n\nSo to wrap this up, let her know that the type of help she wants is having a serious negative effect on your life you are not willing to compromise your mental health for her. If she can't understand that, your friendship has probably run its course.", "Just want to add to this that you would not only enable her but you'd be compromizing your own health.

Her expectation that you are to be frequently available for emergencies sounds like a decision that she made on her own. It is perfectly reasonable for you to tell her that while you sympathize with her condition, it is starting to negatively affect you (mentally or otherwise). You have to decide for yourself what is reasonable. It's clear that you are a giving and caring person, and like to think of yourself this way. But you are allowed to set your own boundaries with her. You can tell her that you just don't have the capacity to disrupt your sleep on a regular basis or drop everything. Also, you don't really have to give her a reason for this, either! \n\nTo put it differently, your friendship with her should not be based on whether you are available to her as free emergency medical transport. \n\nAlso, it is your choice to decide how you spend your time and energy. Time and energy spent toward helping a friend is a good and noble thing. But it should be your choice to do it. If you made the commitment to begin with, you should follow through or come clean why you can't. But it sounds like you didn't \"opt in\". If you do decide to dedicate yourself to her care, it takes away from time and energy you could be spending on other things of your choosing: time and energy spent on your relationship, your family, your career, your hobbies, other friends, helping other people and neighbors, etc etc. In the end, it should be your choice where you put your energy, and where you have committed to putting your efforts. \n\nIt would be a very positive thing if you could have an open discussion about this with your friend. That is: you want to be there for her, but you need to set boundaries for your own well-being. It also sounds really unfair to you that she is leaning on you (and worrying you) and keeping this from her family.

You aren\u2019t her emotional support pet.", "NTA. \n\nFirst, with a 4am text you could have actually slept through it, so your friend shouldn't be mad for a very rational, reasonable excuse. \n\nSecond, if she has decided to tackle this \"on her own\" without therapy, she doesn't get to sign you up- or anyone else- to lead her care. \n\nThird, there is no end in sight for this, and so at some point of course you need to get out of the cycle. She is refusing care, she won't tell others, she isn't making any forward progress. You can't spend years doing this, and with no plan or progress, cutting it off now is good. \n\nFinally, you are right. She can call an ambulance, she can call the family she wanted you to take her to, she can ask her husband to come home from work, she could take at taxi/uber to her family. She had a host of options in an actual medical emergency. \n\nI am totally sympathetic to your friend. I myself had extreme anxiety for about a year after a very scary medical issue, and I relied on friends to talk me down, but I also went to therapy and took medication, and I never got mad when someone was unavailable. \n\nYour friend needs a different plan, and if she is giving the cold shoulder, let her stay cold so you can live your own life.", "NTA\n\nYou have a life and a family of your own. She needs to start depending on hers and stop devaluing your time.", "NTA, for the sake of the friendship I would make it clear you won\u2019t be helping her like this because she needs to continue treatment.", "I have a knee-jerk \"NTA\" reaction, mainly because of this:  \n\n\n\"It all boiled down to last thursday, where I got a message from her at 4 AM, asking me to take her to her parents place because she was having a \u201cmedical emergency\u201d. I saw the message but I ignored because I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. In fact, I ghosted her and went back to sleep. The next day I pretended to have slept through her text and found out she had managed to stay at home until her husband got there\"  \n\n\nMost people are sleeping at 4am.  I've had medical emergencies at 4am, and have decided to call 911 rather than try to get a friend/family member...because shit, it's an emergency, and I assume everyone is sleeping.  \n\nI'm sorry for your friend, but she needs to come up with a new protocol for her emergencies.   \n\nAlso, IMO, you didn't ghost her.  You were (or could have been) asleep.  Come on, that's when most people who work 8-5 are sleeping, right?     \n\n\n NTA.", "INFO\n\nWhy did you start making excuses instead of explaining your situation to her? If she knew everything that you told us in this post, then she, like us would have not found what you did unreasonable.", "Nta. Care giving is emotionally and psychically exhausting. She needs to get back into therapy or medication or something else to occupy her brain then relying on you at 4am. There's helping out friend then there's abusing a friendship. It's gotten to the point of friendship abuse and you have every right to set a boundary about it.", "NTA - Some people, even though they may be nice in many ways are 'emotional vampires' and will ask more and more and more of you until you are emotionally drained. At some point you have to put your own mental health and well being first. \n\nIn this situation your friend has a husband and other family , she also left therapy/ treatment because she wanted to do it by herself. Your life has moved on and you cannot just drop everything to be there for her. As a friend she should understand this, if it makes her cold towards you then i would be asking myself is she actually a true friend.", "Take the cold shoulder and run with it. You aren't responsible for her nor are you equipped to deal with her mental health issues. You are entitled to boundaries, set them. Tell her when you will be comfortable helping and when you won't be available. If she can't accept that, it is time to move on.", "Honey- she didn\u2019t need you for a medical emergency or she wouldn\u2019t have wanted to go to her parents. She wanted company. And expects everyone around her to drop everything and come running. \nEVERYONE needs to stop enabling her, demand she get back into therapy and get a handle on the issue. \nIt sounds to me like she uses this to control people and make them pay attention to her- including her husband. \nYou may want to strongly suggest to him he demand she return to therapy since her \u2018handling of the issue\u2019 is failing miserably and she is backsliding .", "NTA - You are supporting her rather than her husband? \n\nSeems like you aren't being treated like a friend.", "Some people you can't give an inch and you gave inches and she still wants miles..end this now and stop and if it ruins the friendship so be it. YOU have be the one to stop enabling her..NTA but be done with that bs", "NTA\n\nShe is not getting through it on her own. She is instead demanding you enable her and give up your own life. It\u2019s not that she\u2019s in a terrible place, can\u2019t afford professional help and doesn\u2019t have any friends or family other than you (and even if she WAS in that position it still wouldn\u2019t be fair or reasonable for you to be her emotional support dog). But no. She can afford real therapy. She had family. She has a *husband*. She has a wide support network other than you that she is CHOOSING not to utilize. You have done nothing wrong. Boundaries are not an attack. You are your own person not a supporting character for the main character Mary.", "NTA. As other comments are saying, you are being taken advantage of. Enjoy the peace you're getting with that cold shoulder.", "NTA it's an anxiety disorder and she has stopped treatment, the simple answer yo this us I'm not supporting you when you are refusing to help yourself.  Sometimes people eith mental health issues will stop treatment for attention, it sounds like the case in this situation, unfortunately if that is the case pandering to it will just make things worse", "NTA but it\u2019s time for some clear boundaries.\n\n\u201cMary, you can no longer call me when you have an \u201cemergency.\u201d It\u2019s not good for my mental and physical health. You have real options that will help you get better. I can no longer be your crutch when you choose not to use them. I hope you decide to get therapy and professional help. Until then I\u2019m going to need some space.\u201d\n\nTo paraphrase Taylor Tomlinson, if Mary needs floaties to swim in the pool then she\u2019s responsible for using those floaties. She can\u2019t just grab on to you and use you to float.", "NTA...it should be her husband running home not you. And if he is not available, HER family not you. You need to let her know thst. You have your own life with a new husband and while you appreciate your friendship with her you cant be at her beck and call. I dont blame you one bit for ignoring her.", "NTA   it was her choice to drop therapy now she must cope with it by herself. \n\nShe needs to understand that people can't drop everything for her, at any given time\n\nSTOP showing up for her. If she is NOT doing anything to help her self, why should you get out of your way to help her?", "NTA. You aren't an emotional support, service animal, or on call nurse. She's using you and boundaries are desperately needed here. She won't like them, but people who only think of themselves generally don't like other people not dancing to that tune.", "Nta. There is no helping her until she is willing to help herself. She knows she needs to back to treatment & yet she still hasnt. Why?! You can not put your life on hold to hold her hand while she does nothing to help herself. You don't need to feel guilty. You need to have an honest conversation. I would never burden someone on a constant basis if it could be helped & i certainly wouldn't try to make them feel bad if they couldn't do it. Shes def taking advantage", "NTA. Your friend should use all the professional medical help she can get. She\u2019s asking way too much of you (and you have given her so much of your time already).", "NTA\n\nShe has dependency issues and she needs to go back to therapy. You need to keep your distance.", "NTA, what she did was make you her emotional support person. Since she did not want to help her self she wanted you to do it.", "NTA.  Holy crap.  You've been extremely nice and supportive to Mary, but she has a husband and family who should be her support system.  There's no valid reason for her to be so demanding of you.  \n\nShe put you in an incredibly uncomfortable position and you handled it appropriately.  These aren't \"medical emergencies\", especially if she's refusing medical attention.  She's creating this situation and putting a huge burden on you.\n\nAnd I'm not saying her condition shouldn't be taken seriously, but she's not even taking it seriously if she's not telling her family and not getting treatment.", "NTA if she's decided not to continue the therapy that was helping her, she shouldn't expect you to drop everything in your life to be there for her. If anyone is dropping everything it should be her husband.", "NTA.\n\nYour ''friend'' is abusing your generosity. why should you make the extra efforts when she's not willing to do it for herself?", "Agreed. She should never have quit therapy and obviously she can\u2019t manage it alone- or she wouldn\u2019t be calling OP all the time. \n\nPanic attacks can be quite serious, but I\u2019d be very frustrated too- Mary knows what is wrong with her and how to handle it. She\u2019s just choosing not too. She cannot rely on OP as her crutch for life", "NTA\n\nGo away reaction troll!", "Also where's the husband in all this? It would still be inconsiderate towards him but would at least make some sense since they presumably live together.", "This right here. Mental health problems are not your fault, but they're your responsibility to manage. I keep my conditions in check and when I need support, I keep it reasonable. I've been the \"support\" person for somebody with emotional problems and it got to the point where I would get cold and clammy any time my phone rang.", "I think she's escalating in part because your life has changed, you're married and no longer available.\n\nI had a friend with many issues who I had to cut off because she stressed me out and had a negative impact on my life with all her demands. I'm better off.", "Your post made me think about how someone who is trying to help a drowning victim can often be pulled under themselves when they are trying to rescue them. \n\nFor the good of your own mental health and that of your friend you need to disengage from this role. You have in a sense become her enabler. \n\nAnd if she is married, why in the world are you the one she is calling at 4 am?", "Exactly. Once is a medical emergency. Dozens of times is excessive reliance on OP to be at Mary's beck and call, regardless of the hour. NTA", "Yes, I know but they put it up as a comparison as what her friend was treating her as and I just didn\u2019t care for even using the comparison.", "Just because it's her way of doing it doesn't mean that it isn't toxic or selfish. It is terrible behavior and I wouldn't put up with it.", "She should be grateful for all that you've done for her.  Instead it seems like she has a 'what have you done for me' attitude.  Is that a friend? Have you ever ask her for help? How did she respond?\n\nEdit: Tell her to get an emotional support dog.", "Guilting her friend about is ill intent. Other people's feelings matter."]}
