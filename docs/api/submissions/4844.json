{"id": 4844, "submission_id": "zn79o2", "title": "AITA for no longer responding to my friend\u2018s medical emergencies?", "selftext": "I (30F) have been friends with my friend Mary (27F) for roughly 5 years. We\u2019re completely different people who met at work and somehow became pretty close friends. \n\nThree years into our friendship, Mary started becoming sick. No one really knew what was going on, but it all escalated into her passing out at work and needing ambulance to get to a hospital. I could sense she was scared because she didn\u2019t know what was wrong with her. I took it extremely serious and stood by her side through it all. Whenever she texted or called me because of her medical emergency, aka her being scared to collapse or faint randomly, I\u2019d immediately answer and go see her. I spent many days by her side and often spent all day accompanying her until her husband or a direct family member took over. \n\nThis all went on for roughly a year, until she was finally diagnosed with severe anxiety and a panic disorder. She did get it treated through therapy and returned to a new \u201cnormal\u201d, being able to do things alone again. \nIn the meantime, my life had changed drastically, I found a new job, met my now husband, and we moved into our own place. Naturally, we hadn\u2019t seen and spoken much during that time because I was so busy.\n\nAnyway, I found out that Mary\u2019s condition had gotten worse recently when she called me in the middle of the night, asking me to accompany her until her husband would be back from work. I did go to see her and upon asking her why therapy was no longer helping, she claimed she quit therapy because she wanted to \u201cget through it on her own\u201d. I asked her if her family knew but she said she didn\u2019t want to worry them, so they don\u2019t know. Her husband knows. \n\nWell, her calls became more frequent again. But this time, it was hard for me to just leave everything and be there for her. At first I was there for her again, but with time, I just didn\u2019t have the energy to do so anymore. Her requests became irrational and more demanding. And while I have sympathy for her and her condition, I see no point in putting up with it if she\u2019s refusing proper medical help, let alone help from her immediate family. I started making up excuses why I couldn\u2019t help her at certain times.\n\nIt all boiled down to last thursday, where I got a message from her at 4 AM, asking me to take her to her parents place because she was having a \u201cmedical emergency\u201d. I saw the message but I ignored because I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. In fact, I ghosted her and went back to sleep. The next day I pretended to have slept through her text and found out she had managed to stay at home until her husband got there, but she didn\u2019t fail to make me feel bad for ignoring her messages. She\u2019s giving me the cold shoulder since. I know she\u2019s mad I didn\u2019t answer or help her when she needed me.  I do feel guilty but I thought if it really was an emergency she could call an ambulance.

She's asking you to continue enabling her choice to not seek therapy and more appropriate help. You are allowed to set boundaries and you *should* set boundaries on this. She's already shown she's only going to get increasingly more demanding. And while we all love our friends and should be there to help them, you likely aren't trained to deal with this. You aren't the best person to be helping her, and your job as a friend is to be her friend, not her makeshift therapist.", "NTA at all!! So many people feel so entitled to make their medical problems other people\u2019s responsibilities whether it may be mental or physical. I also do sympathize with Mary and I understand how much you have tried to help, but she needs to understand that you are not her on call care taker. If she wants that, then she needs to look into a professional or a consenting adult that is okay with playing that role. Clearly you have started to put up your boundaries and I commend you for that.\n\nShe isn\u2019t thinking about how this can affect your own physical and mental health as well as those around you like your husband and potential/future pets and children. I would suggest just having a conversation with her about it and how you are not capable of playing this role for her, and although you want to be a part of her life and support her, you cannot be who she calls every time.", "NTA. To actively give up on a method that was working at getting her better is ridiculously stupid. Now she could be lying about:\n\n>she claimed she quit therapy because she wanted to \u201cget through it on her own\u201d.\n\nAnd she might have had to stop due to financial reasons, pressure from her husband or something else. If that's the case it's a sad situation for her, but you aren't the cause so you don't owe her any of your time. It sounds like you give up your time when you can which is lovely but she's definitely TA for guilt tripping you when you don't give up your time", "NTA\n\nShe needs back in therapy if her coping is struggling this bad.", "OP, You're NTA In this situation.

It sounds like she never should have left therapy.", "Your friend is very manipulative, and it is not your fault that she refuses to get the help she needs. She is using you as a scapegoat since she has no one else to blame her problems on, and now this is her use for you. Nothing more. You are not a source of comfort for this woman. She wants someone to buy her victim story and to play the blame game when they refuse to comply.\n\nI would suggest you go fully no contact. She is a very abusive person by giving you the cold shoulder the one time you wouldn\u2019t be at her beck and call, and that says a lot more about her and her \u201ccondition\u201d than what she says about herself.\n\nI firmly believe this woman has a serious mental illness.

If she was properly seeking treatment and it was genuinely not working, I'm sure that you would've still gone and helped her. You have done so much more than most people would, and the fact you really needed a break does not make you an asshole.   \nShe needs to realize that she is risking YOUR mental health by not trying to get help for HER mental health, and maybe that is what you need to tell her in order to get it across to her.", "NTA. When you decide to ignore your doctor, you can't keep crying wolf. You need to talk to her and let her know you can't help her if she refuses to follow her treatment plan.

You\u2019re doing ur best, set clear boundaries focus on your stress response to situations and your capacity for emotional energy used to help friends, that you do still care. you can try the \u201cspoons\u201d analogy to get through to her. (sometiems ppl that feel victimized by an illness forget that neurotypical ppl also have emotional thresholds as well) even set a boundary bordering on ultimatum, that she needs to go back in therapy because you\u2019ve noticed her decline and relying more on u since going freestyle. and that there\u2019s no shame in needing help. might not get through the first time. it\u2019s incredibly frustrating, heartbreaking, etc when a loved one refuses treatment :( alternatively, it\u2019s very disempowering to admit you need professional help to live a normal life, feelings, thoughts, like the very basics of being a human are taken from you. her diagnosis is still relatively new in the sense of fluctuating up and down before she settles on a solution, hopefully productive/positive. Got to be assertive and gentle, but sticking it out means the world if you\u2019re up to some growing pains while redefining /enforcing boundaries.", "NTA!!! I think it's evident your friend wouldn't do the same for you, since it's very clear she has 0 regard for your own needs/wants/entire life. I would seriously recommend cutting her out of your life. Maybe just drop a: \"I appreciate the friendship we've shared, but this relationship is very one-sided and, because my life is busier now, I've chosen to only make time for friendships that are genuine. Wish you the best.\" and block + delete on social media. But she also kind of sounds like a crazy (NOT bc of her mental health struggles) unpredictable narcissist, so perhaps just going straight for the block + delete is best.", "NTA / she should go back to therapy if it\u2019s this bad.", "NTA, but you should tell her straight up that her decision to abandon therapy necessarily means she'll need more help from you.  And that's not considerate for you- it's basically saying she expects you to upend your life at 4am because she doesn't want to stick with therapy.  Tell her if she's in therapy and doing everything she can from her side, you will do everything you can and help her as much as you are able.  But if she's not doing her side of things, if she's not in therapy, you don't think it's right for you to be expected to keep supporting her at the expense of your life and sleep.", "NTA.\n\nTell her that you love her and want the best for her, but that you can't help her anymore until she makes the choice to help herself because it sounds like it's beginning to affect your mental health now, too.", "Soft YTA because it shouldn't be asked of you to help so much... but all this could be avoided by having a honest conversation instead of letting things fester. You are not handling this well and this is helping none of you individually, on top of threatening the friendship. You need to tell her that you lack the resources to help her as much as you used to, and that you think she needs more help than you can provide. For both of your sake she needs to understand that this is not working out.\nThis being said I also don't see a real conflict here, as she has not openly blamed you for anything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We had exactly zero things in common, but I was naive and hellbent on being a good person, and she was freshly single and hellbent on hyperfixating on someone else. She was always in crisis and always leaned on me to be her only pillar of support, to an extent that it became obsessive. When I finally realized that she was using me, whether or not it was intentional, I distanced myself until we were no longer speaking, and it was honestly a relief.\n\nI know that sounds cruel, but people who haven't experienced this phenomenon first-hand won't understand.

This going through it alone shit is not working for her, nor for anyone else. What does her husband say in the matter. The ghosting was a bit of an asshole move, even though I understand where you're coming from. But Mary does not, she is sick and needs professional help.  I would tell Mary to get back into therapy, and to not call me until she is. Don't lie about it, there is nothing gained by it.", "NTA\n\nBut... I would ask why she really stopped.  Some people stop therapy for reasons they don't want to talk about.  It wasn't working, can't afford it, etc. And i know, I know she gave you a reason but it could be a bs excuse.  \n\n\nOther than that,  I think you need to set boundaries as the time goes on.

After that it's up to her to act accordingly.", "NTA, did Mary save your life at some point or why have you put up with this nonsense this long?", "NTA. Boundaries are important, but if in the past you were happy to do it and now things have changed, maybe you could explain all this to Mary and set boundaries on when you might be able to help her, but make it clear that you can't be around 24/7 like in the past. It doesn't have to be the end of the friendship, but it really depends on how both of you respond to the situation. You shouldn't feel guilty though.

She reminds me of my sibling with borderline personality disorder. Through a lot of therapy we\u2019ve managed. I did the same as you and eventually stopped taking the late night calls always. Suicide was a risk, but they had other people and other resources through therapy. They know they can call me and I\u2019ll answer when reasonable to me and a text being like emergency please answer will get a response usually, but therapy got them to respect my boundaries and autonomy.

Once it was clear what she has, I should\u2019ve drawn the line but I guess I was too far in to stop it. Either way you are right, I should seek a conversation with her about this.", "This, though my vote is a soft ESH. It sounds like you might be suffering from compassion fatigue. While it isn't great to come out and say \"I'm fed up with helping you with your medical problems\" or outright ignoring her, it IS great to set and express your boundaries. Your fatigue is as real as her own medical problems, and you both deserve better than the current situation.", "Mary\u2019s way of showing she\u2019s upset with you is giving you a cold shoulder.

She\u2019s made big financial decisions recently by starting a new business, but I don\u2019t know\u2026. I think investing into a new business shouldn\u2019t be put above her mental health. She should be investing in therapy instead. But that\u2019s just my opinion. It\u2019s true, even if she can\u2019t afford it right now, it\u2019s not okay for her to guilt me. I just needed to hear (or in this case: read) it. So thank you.", "Yes, this! OP if Mary gives you \"the silent treatment\", take it with both hands and run off like a bandit!! Use it as an excuse to Block and just...never talk with her again. \n\nSrsly her \"medical emergencies\" sound like, at best, ASRs (Acute Stress Reactions). They're not going to kill her.
