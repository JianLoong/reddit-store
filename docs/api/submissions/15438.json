If they are happy with you staying then discuss expectations, chores, finances, etc", "Perfection! I\u2019m sorry for all the mean comments\u2026 if no one\u2019s said that here . And you\u2019re not the asshole\u2026 assholes don\u2019t look in the mirror, recognize they have been inconsiderate, and make amends. Appreciate your parents as much as you do your kids! \ud83d\ude42", "Why can't you cook meals before you leave for work? Your parents are taking care of your kids. Maybe make lunch during the day for your whole family?", "You also aren't considering any time it takes to prepare all these meals. You think she doesn't know that buying all that fast food isn't the best/healthiest option? Sometimes it's what you have time for with a hectic schedule.", "She already said she cooks some days.", "Even tho you have asked in the past, it's apparent that mom has an issue with you not checking in every time.  Since they are providing you with free room and board And child care, that seems like a small ask to make mom feel appreciated.", "And then she counts beating up leftovers as cooking on some days, so how often is it?", "No you're not the AH.  Your mom sounds like a real piece of work.", "YTA. I've had to live with family before with my kids. I always invited and extended offers whenever we got food or went out to eat. It's not about if they can afford their own food. It's about compassion and being a good person.", "Sorry, YTA. It would have been polite to ask, even if they usually say no. You are very lucky to have a place to stay. When I was a young (22) divorced mother, neither of my parents took me and my son in, and I was getting no child support from my ex. I had to make due and pay everything on my own working service jobs and making little more than minimum wage. If my parents had taken me in and helped me care for my son, you better believe I would ask them every time.", "YTA I was raised to get food for everyone \u2014 ask/call before buying anything. 90% of the time they don\u2019t want anything, but I ask anyway because it\u2019s how I was taught. I\u2019ve also got friends and family who do the same \u201chey \u2014 before I get there I\u2019m stopping off at random_fastfood\u2014 want anything?\u201d I usually ask if they\u2019re going to get themselves anything. If not, I say I don\u2019t need/want anything.", "YTA Your parents have been kind enough to take you and your children in to live with them not to mention they provide you with free childcare.\n\nThe very least you could do to show your appreciation is ask them if they want anything when you buy food.", "I reheat the leftovers for myself after I get off work, not for them. Everyone picks at the leftovers for a day or two as snacks, not as the next dinner. When told it\u2019s my day to cook, I will do it. It\u2019s always a fresh meal too", "Two \u201c99 percent of the time\u201d in one post? I\u2019m going to have to question the reliability of your narrative.", "Maybe you shouldn't get takeout so often.", "I do my own laundry and my kids laundry. I wouldn\u2019t ever ask my parents to do that, those clothes are my responsibility. If I ever want to do something kid free on a day off, I ask a friend. I don\u2019t ask my parents for extra babysitting", "Unless she\u2019s ordering strictly off the value menu she\u2019s absolutely spending more than $20. \n\nAlso what about the other meals when she\u2019s working? Breakfast? She buying her own groceries or eating her parents food?", "It's not avocado toast. That $240 per month to cover eight meals could almost cover groceries for the whole month. OP is being very wasteful.", "Why don't you have sandwich, fruit, chips for lunch?? That would be waaaaaaaaaay cheaper and would actually save you time.", "The reheated food is for myself after I get off work. Not for my parents. They\u2019ll put leftovers in the fridge that are for everyone and I take a small portion and heat it up for myself. When I cook for everyone, I make a whole meal", "Dinner is usually made from 6-7. I work at 5. And my mom doesn\u2019t eat in the mornings or early afternoon around lunch time. My step dad isn\u2019t even home during lunch time", "Her schedule doesn't sound all that \"hectic.\"", "Yta", "NTA!!! You already knew your mom doesn\u2019t eat in the mornings and that morning your stepdad was at work\u2026 your mom is acting entitled, asking you to offer even though she doesn\u2019t eat breakfast. You shouldn\u2019t have to walk on eggshells with her. \u201cI don\u2019t eat breakfast but you should still offer!\u201d What?", "So think about this - both parents get home roughly around 1 pm - normal lunch time , and you\u2019ve already gotten take out lunch for yourself and got nothing for anyone who gets home at 1. I get that if you buy it at 10:30 then it\u2019s cold and gross by 1. But that\u2019s a hella early lunch. It feels like you go out of your way to buy it when mom is asleep/dad at work so you can avoid sharing. But then by 1 everyone is home together, and \u201cyou already ate\u201d and they fend for themselves. But then every night they make dinner and you have a ready made dinner fresh to go for you. \n\nSo it would be very nice to consider adjusting the routine so you get lunch for everyone at 1 for when mom get home and step dad gets off work. \n\nI feel it\u2019s a bit YTA.", "Maybe you get a crackpot.  Make a roast. Your mom could make Mashed Potatoes.  Or you can make chicken and dumplings.  You can cook dinner for your family and take care of things for your kids.   I am not trying to give you a hard time.  Just suggestions you might try to help your parents out.", "Thank you. We do have a crockpot, it gets used for sausage with beans and also the roast. But the roast gets started the night before and slow cooks. Now that you mention it, I have seen other recipes that I\u2019ve wanted to try out. Thank you! I\u2019ll search for them so I can help out with dinners like those more often", "There are tons of great crockpot recipes out there! My family skis in the winter, so on the weekends we go skiing we prep a crockpot meal like soup, stew, or chili in the morning so that we have a warm meal ready when we come home at the end of the day. It's also great for making double batches of things, which you can then freeze half of for future lunches."]}
