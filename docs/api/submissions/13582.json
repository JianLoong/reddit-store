My MIL has never been an involved grandma. She\u2019s met all 3 kids, but we don\u2019t live in the same state and she doesn\u2019t do phone calls, video chats, texts, cards, gifts, or anything with them. She used to talk to my husband sporadically and would just ask him to \u201cpass on her love.\u201d That\u2019s all fine, our kids understand that an interested grandma would be really cool, but we just don\u2019t have that with MIL and that\u2019s not their fault. \n\nIn 2021 MIL had a huge falling out with my husband. She asked him to bring the kids to visit her during a big COVID wave. Our youngest was too young for a vaccine so our family all vaxxed and masked to keep her safe. MIL and her husband were anti-vax, anti-mask, vacationing in an RV park, posting to FB about boat parties, bars, karaoke, bingo, etc. My husband kept it simple - it would be too risky for our little girl to visit right now. MIL said it wouldn\u2019t be risky because she always stayed home and didn\u2019t go out around other people. My husband didn\u2019t call her on the lie, but just stuck to it would be too risky. MIL ended up yelling at him about being selfish, unloving, and mis-informed and ended with \u201cI can\u2019t even talk to you anymore, I\u2019ll call you when I want to talk\u201d and hung up.\n\nMy husband and I talked about it after and thought that she should call and apologize if she wants to restore some sort of relationship. She hasn\u2019t called since. Our cell phone number is posted on our business website homepage. Every few months MIL comments on our business social media: \u201cI tried calling but I don\u2019t have your new number so guess you\u2019ll have to call me!\u201d then \u201cGod gave us family and you\u2019re missing it!\u201d then \u201cGee I sure would love to be able to call and wish my grandson a happy birthday!\u201d When my husband\u2019s dad (MIL\u2019s ex-husband) passed away a few months ago, MIL texted a copy of a FB post from my husband\u2019s sister to my husband\u2019s aunt and asked her to text it to my husband to \u201clet him know.\u201d (Another member of the family had already contacted my husband directly.)\n\nThen a few days ago there was a card in the mailbox addressed to our youngest. When she opened it, it was an Easter card with a $35 check enclosed that said, \u201cDear <OurDaughter>, This is our mailing address and phone number. We hope you\u2019ll want to call or write us sometime, Love you so much, <MIL and HerHusband>\u201d (We asked our daughter if she wanted to write back and she said \u201cNo, just put it in the trash, please, I don\u2019t even care about the money.\u201d So we did, though we did give her the $35 to replace the trashed check.)\n\nSo it definitely seems like MIL thinks any problem is on our side, and we\u2019ve had some people say \u201cYou should just talk to her, that\u2019s family, etc.\u201d So AITA for ignoring these attempts unless she actually calls?", "created_utc": 1680198376, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126u3no/aita_for_ignoring_my_mils_passiveaggressive/", "score": 178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yeah no don't acknowledge that petty and troublesome card.\n\nIF she actually wanted to repair the relationship she has with her son and you, should would actually reach out and make that clear. Instead its messenger pigeons and a card to your youngest. \n\nKeep ignoring her.", "NTA- I had a set of toxic grandparents growing up and I wish I didn\u2019t have to deal with them as a kid.

Smart move not cashing the check.", "NTA. \n\nA lot of people would be better off if they cut out their toxic and manipulative relatives.

That is an attempt to emotionally manipulate both of you. \n\nYour husband and you know what kind of person your MIL is and have made a decision to cut her from your life. That\u2019s what this is. You may word it as she needs to call and apologize but it\u2019s cutting her off.

You're being less extreme than I'd be, by leaving the door open for them at all.", "NTA seems like she is more worried about herself, than the health of your family. Also, regardless of if you changed/cancelled your phone number she can reach out via Facebook, email or write you a letter. I think a lot of people forget that relationships work both ways. If she actually cared, she would have tried to call sooner, or reached out via a different method.", "NTA your MIL sounds like a narcissist. It seems like she has a phone plan similar to my brother's that only takes incoming calls. Being sarcastic, he never calls anyone and always expects others to call him. You're a good parent by allowing your child invest as much interest in her grand as she has in them. And you talked it over with your spouse, so this wasn't a  unilateral decision.\n\nIf I were to respond to anything, it would have been to one of the passive-aggressive FB posts they were able to locate that, they could also locate the phone# in the same space. Since they chose not to use it, it was safe to assume they didn't wish to communicate. And good for you to protect you and your family's health over your MILs ignorance.", "NTA, your MIL is a liar and had no problem risking your child's health because she's a self centered, nutjob. She made her bed, she can lay in it. I'd block her from commenting on your business posts.", "NTA\n\nShe said she would call when she wanted to talk and she never did", "NTA.  Sounds like my grandmother.  Never anything to do with us, and years later, she actually blamed my dad for not bringing us around, when in truth, they had moved years earlier and did not tell us!  She told my grandfather that she had let all of us know.  She lied.  Then, she wanted to be the good grams.  Actually tried to prevent anyone from telling my dad that his father was in hospital dying.  Fortunately, an aunt told him, so he was able to connect before he passed. But when my dad went, she actually said Oh, nice of you to show up!  My dad explained to my gramps that she had never contacted us, and in fact, his sister called.   Sometimes, the damage is done.  Civil is all you can muster.  Be civil.  Move on.", "INFO - has your phone number changed since your last call?", "ESH\n\nYou changes your number and didn't tell her. She should not have to go to your business page to find your personal contact info. I wouldn't even expect that to be listed on a business page.\n\nShe made it clear she didn't know your number, and you're CONTINUED to not reach out and tell her. At this point it looks on her end like you've deliberately blocked her and that's a reasonable assumption on her part.", "ESH.  She\u2019s definitely being passive aggressive but so are you in a lesser sense. \n\nCash her check and call her once at least. If she never calls back you know that\u2019s on her and can say \u201cwe have you our number\u201d. \n\nAs far as being selfish- she refused to get vaccinated so she\u2019s the selfish one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She went low contact herself, please appreciate the weird blessing that is and make it final", "Well first of all, you're NTA.  I guess I would have to ask if your MIL has traditionally been toxic, or just uninvolved.  \n\nThat generation is weird.  They grew up with parents that never apologized and half of them have taken that to mean when they hit that age, they don't have to either.  They were also raised to put up with toxic family because they are family.  So when its their turn to be a toxic pain the rear, they are slow to admit they are wrong, because they are emulating the way they were treated when they were younger.\n\nIf she's simply been uninvolved up to this point and not toxic,  I just wonder if this is hill to die on.  If you have changed your landline and only have your business number posted, sometimes that generation is weird and will try to call the house phone only, especially if that is how she originally called your husband.\n\nI would at least consider finding away to say \"you can contact me at <enter number here> and see if she's up for an apology.  While she may not be deserving if she is a toxic presence in your life, if she simply lives far away and isn't overly involved, she may want to become that and you kids would benefit from it.  I mean, if she wanted to see our kids during covid, I can't imagine she was non existent?  \n\nBut you know the full situation more than me, so if she's toxic, by all means, ignore any and all attempts at contact.  But if you are bitter about her relative lack of involvement/interest in your kids at this point, then for your children's sake it might not be the hill to die on, that could change.   Just my two cents.", "NTA.

Would you?", "If I were actually _trying_ to get a hold of a family member and that was the only number I had? Yes, I would use that number, especially if I was aware that it was _their_ own personal business. Even if it was just their place if work and they didn't own it, I would still call and ask that someone pass along a message asking said family to call me back.
