You could have very easily said \"Turn the light on and make sure its not in energy saving mode\"", "Now there's three sides to every story, this person, that person, n truth. So, I'd say yes you're the AH for literally telling her to shut up. I grew up in an abusive home w my birth mother always telling us to stfu, calling us names, me esp since I was the only girl, destroyed my self esteem, etc. I've been in abusive relationships where it's a red flag to me. Yes it could've been handled differently. Did she need to get an attitude about the ac? No but I deal w the same issue w my husband. He always is cold as I'm always hot. I need the AC n a fan on n he bundles up like it's Alaska when it's like 65F. I cannot stand it when he shuts off the fan as our room holds like all the heat of the house. If I wake up sweating, feeling dehydrated, I will have to chug a couple waters n knowing how it feels to wake up, overheated, dehydrated, period or not, just the heat alone can make anyone dizzy. So, in her defense, she could've been overheating, sweating, n dizzy, hence why she didn't get up right away. She could've reacted differently but waking up like that isn't the greatest. But I think you're both in the wrong. She could've woke up, tried to gain herself, if she needed help, she could've asked you to get up, that she's having an issue, n help her out. You could've been a little nicer, but I also know that I've been woken up by my husband giving me an attitude over the fucking blankets n I've been snippy myself. It is what it is. It's not a big deal. It's something a simple apology should be said, from both sides. None of us was there, so in reality it could've been something as little as you taking her having a hard time w overheating as her giving you an attitude so you retaliate n now she's more upset than begin w. Every night I have to have the AC on econ mode so our kids don't get cold but be able to have a series of fans trying to blow cool air up to our room. My kids, however, take after me n sweat like me n can't tolerate heat too well. There's been times I've almost collapsed while working, or just doing daily chores, or even just going to the store depending on the heat n humidity. It sucks but I try n manage it. My husband n I have a routine n he usually has extra covers while I'm happy w a sheet n a fan, especially since we literally sleep right against one another like most couples would. \n\nSo just say you're sorry n I'm sure she'd say sorry too. Just tell her yes it was rude of you to tell her to shut up bc it was, n that you're sorry n I'm sure she would do the same. It's a petty n small issue that shouldn't make or break the deal of your relationship. My husband n I lost our oldest in our arms n it tore us to pieces yet we ended up going through a lot to recover from that, lost my dad, losing his gram who raised him, etc. We've been through a lot n sometimes when I read stories or posts like this, it just really puts in the reality of how petty things can be. It's small. It's not worth the fight. It's over the damn ac. It's literally not like something where someone cheated or you guys are losing a loved one (could be something deeper, idk, I'm just saying as example), it literally could be worse. \n\nJust apologize. You're both ah in my opinion, her for the way she woke you up n you for being rude. Say sorry, kiss, make up. N really look at the fact that shit could be worse.", "Show her how to operate the AC in the dark and then you won't have to yell at her.", "Sounds like she\u2019s human & not perfect", "NTA I would have told her to check it herself.

If you woke her up doing the same thing, she'd say it was abusive. Just because your a man and she's a woman doesn't change the facts. You say she's not usually like this, which means it has happened before.", "NTA.  Not sure why GF was not able to see the AC controls.

Yet it\u2019s been ten years and she still gets mad at me when I do", "NTA me and my wife have a rule where anything said up to 30 minutes after you wake up doesn't count because we will both say some wild $hit if we are halfway awake.

Disrespectful", "Naw, she started off yelling for no reason, maybe she should learn to use the damn ac", "Rude, yes. Wrong, not even remotely.", "NTA\n\nI mean, you didn't shout for no reason, and the reason motivating her shouting was petty as fuck as far as can be seen. So the Aircon wasn't on, big fuckin deal. This didn't need to be a drawn out screaming fit on her part, but at 2AM she's throwing a fit because it's hot? Is she an actual child? How is she nearly 30 and losing her shit over something so miniscule?\n\nSo, no, you're not the asshole. You're not her whipping post, you're not her punching bag, you're not an acceptable target. You don't deserve to be shouted at over nothing, and if there is something she can communicate it in a civil manner.\n\nThat you shouted at her was merely to shut that shit down, because she'd clearly gone past the point of talking to calmly.", "NTA. Why the hell she thinks she can do this is beyond me, it\u2019s just not decent.\n\nSure, you shouldn\u2019t have yelled at her but honestly it\u2019s pretty understandable for being awakened and yelled at in the middle of the night.", "[removed]", "she just woke up from falling asleep on the couch and this was her reaction coming into the room.

Would you feel the same if it was the wife claiming her husband woke her up yelling about the AC? Honest question.", ">Edit to add: I\u2019m honestly doubting whether she was actually yelling or if OP is exaggerating. Like, why is she yelling about the AC in the middle of the night?\n\nI love when people do this, it's honestly incredible.\n\nSo you choose to believe he's lying about the thing that makes him look good, but he's not lying about the thing that makes him look bad.\n\nHow convenient.\n\nJust say you'll find any excuse to demonise him.", "There was no reason for her to even wake him up at all. She's a big girl and probably has this little thing called a cell phone that has a light on it. \n\nSo weird that you doubt OP bc he didn't follow the exact script you would have written for him. you the gf?", "I already read your prior comments in this post.

They both yelled so I said ESH. Especially over something small like the AC. It\u2019s weird that I need to spell this out for people, but it\u2019s Reddit so it is what it is.\n\nLoud volume/yelling can be relative. What sounds like yelling to someone in the middle of the night who\u2019s been sleeping in total silence and has had their sleep interrupted may not have actually sounded or felt like yelling to another person who was not asleep.

I'm glad you've never had an AH bf yell at you in the middle of the night but that doesn't really set the standard, ya know?", "He claims she shouted at him. The fact that she woke him up to shout at him explains why he shouted at her, making him look better in this situation. You assume this is a lie. \n\nHe claims he shouted at her. You don't assume this is a lie.\n\nIt's very convenient you assume he's lying about the thing that explains why he shouted. \n\nHow the fuck did he escalate?

Why would he shout at her for no reason? \n\nIf you doubt she was truly yelling and was instead just being loud, why not apply that same thought to him?\n\nSo she wasn't yelling, just being loud, but he was yelling.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhy are you clearly holding them to two very different standards?", "And projecting\u2026", "I\u2019m being patient with you, for some unknown reason.", "Ok, this would be important to include in the post, especially since you\u2019ve already brought it up to her before. \nPeriod doesn\u2019t change anything. It\u2019s not an excuse for her to be an AH, etc.\nI think this is a bigger issue with her not being considerate, OP, that you guys really need to talk out during the daylight hours. Like I\u2019ve been commenting, it\u2019s just basic common courtesy/respect to not yell at your partner when they\u2019re sleeping.
