You could have very easily said \"Turn the light on and make sure its not in energy saving mode\"", "Now there's three sides to every story, this person, that person, n truth. So, I'd say yes you're the AH for literally telling her to shut up. I grew up in an abusive home w my birth mother always telling us to stfu, calling us names, me esp since I was the only girl, destroyed my self esteem, etc. I've been in abusive relationships where it's a red flag to me. Yes it could've been handled differently. Did she need to get an attitude about the ac? No but I deal w the same issue w my husband. He always is cold as I'm always hot. I need the AC n a fan on n he bundles up like it's Alaska when it's like 65F. I cannot stand it when he shuts off the fan as our room holds like all the heat of the house. If I wake up sweating, feeling dehydrated, I will have to chug a couple waters n knowing how it feels to wake up, overheated, dehydrated, period or not, just the heat alone can make anyone dizzy. So, in her defense, she could've been overheating, sweating, n dizzy, hence why she didn't get up right away. She could've reacted differently but waking up like that isn't the greatest. But I think you're both in the wrong. She could've woke up, tried to gain herself, if she needed help, she could've asked you to get up, that she's having an issue, n help her out. You could've been a little nicer, but I also know that I've been woken up by my husband giving me an attitude over the fucking blankets n I've been snippy myself. It is what it is. It's not a big deal. It's something a simple apology should be said, from both sides. None of us was there, so in reality it could've been something as little as you taking her having a hard time w overheating as her giving you an attitude so you retaliate n now she's more upset than begin w. Every night I have to have the AC on econ mode so our kids don't get cold but be able to have a series of fans trying to blow cool air up to our room. My kids, however, take after me n sweat like me n can't tolerate heat too well. There's been times I've almost collapsed while working, or just doing daily chores, or even just going to the store depending on the heat n humidity. It sucks but I try n manage it. My husband n I have a routine n he usually has extra covers while I'm happy w a sheet n a fan, especially since we literally sleep right against one another like most couples would. \n\nSo just say you're sorry n I'm sure she'd say sorry too. Just tell her yes it was rude of you to tell her to shut up bc it was, n that you're sorry n I'm sure she would do the same. It's a petty n small issue that shouldn't make or break the deal of your relationship. My husband n I lost our oldest in our arms n it tore us to pieces yet we ended up going through a lot to recover from that, lost my dad, losing his gram who raised him, etc. We've been through a lot n sometimes when I read stories or posts like this, it just really puts in the reality of how petty things can be. It's small. It's not worth the fight. It's over the damn ac. It's literally not like something where someone cheated or you guys are losing a loved one (could be something deeper, idk, I'm just saying as example), it literally could be worse. \n\nJust apologize. You're both ah in my opinion, her for the way she woke you up n you for being rude. Say sorry, kiss, make up. N really look at the fact that shit could be worse.", "Show her how to operate the AC in the dark and then you won't have to yell at her.", "[deleted]", "NTA I would have told her to check it herself.

Wrong, not even remotely.", "NTA\n\nI mean, you didn't shout for no reason, and the reason motivating her shouting was petty as fuck as far as can be seen. So the Aircon wasn't on, big fuckin deal.

How is she nearly 30 and losing her shit over something so miniscule?\n\nSo, no, you're not the asshole. You're not her whipping post, you're not her punching bag, you're not an acceptable target.

That\u2019s one of the early signs of abuse; Something I went through for years with a previous partner - And even accepted - before I figured it out.\n\nYelling, screaming at you at 2AM over the AC settings? Work early or not, that\u2019s no good. Get out now my friend. Do not accept that behavior from anyone.", "NTA\n\nI'd go ballistic if someone woke me up with a question that they can easily go answer themselves - ie going to check that the a/c is running and if not, to turn it back on. \n\nI'd be ultra annoyed if they disrupted my sleep and I had to go to work the next day.", "NTA, she was being obnoxious and rude, you need tO let her know that, donT let her play victim", "NTA apparently she isn\u2019t a paraplegic because she ran out the room so therefore her legs did work her hands work as well I\u2019m assuming why couldn\u2019t she get her butt up and look at it herself just asking because that is one selfish woman and she\u2019s like that all the time. Yes I\u2019m for divorce. I\u2019m sorry it is. Good luck with that and hopefully you get better sleep maybe hotel be good for her to get one she put on any temperature she wants is it waking you up to get up and do it that\u2019s crazy no no she sleep on the couch like every day you sleep nice and comfortably in your bed.", "Someone wakes me up on a work night yelling at me the house better be on fire or they better be having a heart attack or stroke.  NTA.", "Bro what? NTA!! Shutup woman, you know how the thermostat works", "NTA She yelled at you for No Reason other than she was too lazy to check the AC herself. I'd reconsider your relationship unless she apologizes, kisses your ass and changes her toxic attitude", "NTA\nShe can go all the way to the couch but can switch on the lights to see the AC? Honestly I\u2019m glad she slept on the couch because you didn\u2019t deserve to be woken up in the middle of the night unless it\u2019s an emergency with her or the baby. You didn\u2019t deserve to be yelled at.", "NTA. Leave her on the couch to think about what she did wrong and then have her say sorry. Acting like a little brat.", "NTA. You were half asleep. Sleepy you is not the same as awake you. I know this because sleepy me does stupid things that awake me regrets all the time.", "The fact that her problem is solved with the literal push of a button \ud83d\ude2d like the AC TELLS YOU what setting it\u2019s on \ud83d\udc80", "NTA I\u2019d be pissed, too. At least you can yell at her to shut up. I live at home and help take care of my grandma who has mild dementia. From time to time she wakes me up at 0\u2019dark thirty to help her look for her phone, tv remote, help her turn the tv on to what she wants to watch because explaining streaming is like trying to teach calculus. A few nights ago she woke me up because she needed aspirin. The worst part of that is she can\u2019t help it and I feel like a schmuck for getting irritated. Your girlfriend is just infantile.", "NTA.\n\nI would not wake up anyone I know has to get up early to go to work. Very inconsiderate of her.", "Waking people up is bad juju. NTA. She\u2019s outta her damn mind for that.", "What is wrong with people?", "NTA\n\nDude, is your girlfriend amputee or have disabilities for seeing? If you are not comfortable in that room so get the f*ck up and look a/c or open window idk.", "NTA she can shut up and duck off with that nonsense", "NTA. I get awful periods that make me feel like I could snap at people because of my intense mood swings, but I'm mature enough to not wake people up in the middle of the night. That's no excuse for her to act that way.", "NTA. When I was on a family trip, I shared a room with my aunt  cause she is a heavy sleeper and has no problem falling asleep. On night, she got an international call around 2AM, instead of answering it in bathroom or balcony\u2026no, she just sat in her bed and started to yell at whoever on the phone and repeated say \u2018you got it wrong\u2019 \ud83d\ude02 I was so pissed cause I have insomnia and just got like 40 min sleep so I screamed, at the top of my lungs. I literally said SHUT THE FUCK UP in screaming and then she stopped. If whoever called her got it wrong, just tell him once and tell him to fix it. No need to say it like 8 times and increase the volume every time, makes no sense, problem won\u2019t fix itself with all the yelling anyway.", "Hahahah sorry mate but im in your boat too lol I copped a cranky 2am wakeup because someone couldn't find their pillow hahahahaha, poor bugger had just finished a 70 hour week, 2 kids under 2 and was on day 2 lol. I just gave her mine, I laughed and went back to sleep. Hahahah she made me pancakes 3 days later as a sorry hahahah which is ok, I get she was just overwhelmed lol just be patient mate, bring it up in a few days when you've had a chance to let the emotion of the issue go. You guys will be ok, just have a good chat and be kind to each other.", "NTA \n\nShe has hands; she could easily find it by herself. Not to say about yelling at people in the middle of the night after pulling them out of sleep. She's the AH here \ud83e\udee0", "NTA, I have been in your shoes and I believe there has even been a study, where they woke someone up everytime he was falling asleep (they could tell by brainwaves or smth) and no matter how kind the guy was before, they were all very irritable and aggressive after the experiment.", "ESH\nYelling at a partner is unacceptable period.", "NTA.\n\nShe was yelling first. Your GF might be a red flag my man.", "\u201cCouldn\u2019t see the ac\u201d turn on a light or use your flashlight on your phone and you\u2019ll be able to see it just fine", "Nta a man needs to tell his gf to shut up regularly to keep her in check lol", "Nta she can check the fucking thing herself. I recommend to dump her right this very second.", "NTA. Sounds like she has a case of princess syndrome and expects everyone to do things for her rather than getting off her arse and doing them herself. There are tons of valid reasons to wake someone up but that isn't one of them.", "i would tell my wife something else if she starts yelling at me at 2 am over the a/c settings. is she always to incompetent to use an a/c. NTA", "Even if you can't check it yourself for some reason, there are nice ways to wake up your partner (or family member, or caretaker) to ask.", "LMAOOO I love how all these comments be roasting", "ah yes because it\u2019s completely normal to yell at your partner for being groggy at 2 am in the morning, being unable to walk a few rooms down to turn on the ac herself, and then continue to yell at them after they do the task you are completely capable of doing(did i mention it\u2019s 2 am in the morning)", "I. Am. Dying.", "Actually scientists are predicting that with new drugs we'll probably see ages of 150 to 200 within our lifetime!", "There's always people even though the OP could be 100% free of any wrong doing lol. This sub and many of the dating/relationships subs are like that.", "So that gives him a reason to be an asshole?", "SHE CAN'T SEE THE SETTING.  Y'ALL ARE BULLYING THE WRONG ONE", "I saw that claim and am not looking forward to it.\n\nImagine being 120 and POOR.\n\nWhat will the new retirement age be?\n\nGoodness.", "Given that she woke him up in the middle of the night and basically yelled at him about the AC and made him go turn it then further still yelled at him after he got back in bed? \n\nYes. \n\nTelling her to shut up was nicer than I'd be if someone did that to me. Especially if I worked early the next day.\n\nIn what world is the asshole here?", "Yeah everybody knows that! I have a uterus so I am unable to understand such things that the menfolk call the thermostat.", "I was woken up while heavily pregnant to go check the thermostat for him.  He got a whole tirade of \u2018You mfer! I can barely get off the bed!\u2019", "I know! I think it\u2019s cause I have the  vagina and the breasteses! If we don\u2019t have the testosterones  how would we ever get any thermostat to work? I\u2019m confused because am so easily confused. Sometimes, we need a good old fashioned dose of mansplaing!  \ud83e\udd2a", "Not only \"turns on\" the AC, eh?", "Can be *hard* to *turn on*", "It's not the new touchscreens, it's an old engineering solution, just whack the unit with a hammer. Replace hammer with your dong where no hammer is immediately available.\n \nDepending on severity of unit failure, might require smaller or larger dong.", "^boop", "RCC.
