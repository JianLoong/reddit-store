He sounds young and entitled.

Your husband is a selfish deadbeat who can't be bothered to care for his own child. He should not be taking the entire weekend to himself when he has a family.", "Is it really about the baby sitter or are you annoyed that he would rather carry out his hobby than spend time with his child?\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of time to spend on a hobby. I think I would want to have a serious conversation about the importance of family time and being all together for fun activities, not just the day to day drudgery of parenting.", "INFO: Does he take care of the kid on weekdays? Are you the main/sole breadwinner? Are babysitter fees easily affordable?", "10000% NTA", "INFO: does he take care of the kids at all?\n\nEdit: after the op stated they both parent during the week, and the child is 20 months old, I am saying NAH. Both of you are entitled to hobbies and time to yourself. Sounds like he is presenting a way you both can get away to do that.", "NTA- Tell him he\u2019s a father now and he needs to start acting like it", "When a father doesn\u2019t want to \u201cbabysit\u201d their own kid, it\u2019s a huge \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nIt\u2019s not babysitting if it\u2019s your own kid! It\u2019s literally being a parent. The job I\u2019m assuming you both signed up for when getting pregnant and following through with the pregnancy. JFC.", "NTA\n\nIn a nutshell, he needs to cut the S and step the F up. You two have a kid now. Noone is saying he can't do anything, but duties should be shared, and a little bonding might actually benefit the kid, crazy idea.", "NTA\nAs the child's parent,  your partner should,  at least once in a while,  spend time actually parenting.  Particularly since you are bearing most of the parenting AND you must be doing more of the other tasks needed for a household to function (groceries,  laundry, pick up prescriptions, organize doctors appointments,  cooking cleaning and the thousand other little things). I make this assumption because   of all the time he spends on recreational activities away from the house and his reluctance to just let you have a break. \n\nIf a sitter is in the budget (and I mean HIS discretionary funds), by all means, take that 2 to 4 hours,  once or twice a week to run errands,  socialize, indulge your hobbies, or just sit alone somewhere with your beverage of choice and enjoy a bit of time with nothing to do but people-watch, read, whatever. ....but you are not wrong to want him to be playing an active,  engaged role in caring for the child.", "NTA- he needs to realise he is a parent now.", "One of these two is not like the other, one of these two is just not the same.  One is a parent, the other a child.  NTA", "NTA.  What\u2019s frustrating is that he doesn\u2019t want to take care of the kids.  Sounds like he doesn\u2019t want to raise them.

Is he an absentee dad?", "Child is 20 mo and we both parent during the week", "NTA", "Info: have you had a honest discussion with him about how you feel about the time away from the family he spends on his hobbies. Not saying he should not do any but clearly there needs to be a balance \n\nDoes he spend/care for the kids during the week? \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your feelings are valid. I would be upset if my partner was gone all weekend every weekend regardless of having child care or not so that I could also have free time. Having hobbies is cool, but going absent the the weekend isn't.  There is no time for family bonding or time to spend on your relationship, and relationships need time.  A sitter would be better spent on a date night for you guys rather than free time for individual activities.", "All the top posts are shit talking the dad.  A babysitter is the perfect solution.  \n\nYou\u2019re making yourself a martyr by forcing yourself to not enjoy life.  The kids will be fine and you\u2019ll have a great time out, just like your husband. \n\nMaybe invite an uncle, aunt, cousin or grandparent to be with your kids.  I\u2019d hang out with my kin to give the parents a day out any time", "NTA at all.  Question, who is the primary parent during the week?", "Info: What are you actually upset about? The money spend on childcare? Him not spending enough time with the kids? Uneven childcare duties between you two?", "NTA.  Do you guys have any kind of separate finances or separate discretionary spending money?  If so, you could make it clear that if he's hiring a babysitter then that would be coming out of his spending money.\n\nHonestly though, he sounds like a lazy parent, and his expectation that you'll be the one to do all the childcare while he gets to live a carefree focusing on his hobbies would drive me to breaking point in your shoes.", "I think NAH. It's okay for you to feel frustrated at this situation. But it's not necessarily an AH thing to hire a babysitter since you added he does care for the child during the week and it seems like this happened fairly last minute. I think it's just something you need to have a proper talk about for the future to make sure things are split evenly on weekends.", "ESH with a heavy leaning towards N T A. Yes, they shoukd want to parent their kids, but also don't feel guilty enjoying yourself and taking me time while a sitter watches the kids", "NTA\n\nHiring a babysitter isn't the same as having a parent taking care of the child. You still essentially have to be on call in case something happens at home. \n\nWhy doesn't your husband want to spend time with his baby? It seems to me like he's prioritizing his hobbies over his child. \n\nParents do need time away from their kids but not to the excess of not spending time with them.", "YTA.\n\nYou stated that you parent together during the week, so it\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t do his share or spend time with your child. A babysitter allows BOTH parents to have time away.", "NAH. H may be reading a bit into this, but it seems like you resent him a bit for his hobbies. Or to some degree it seems you enjoying your free time in contingent on him sacrificing his, which is something you might want to explore if any of this was fitting.", "YTA.\n\nYou are resentful of him and his schedule that you haven't asserted your disproval of enough. You said you wanted to do something, and he said he could solve the problem. You just don't like his solution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINFO: What is your real concern? Not spending enough time with kid? Not acknowledging the unequal child rearing? If you know the answer to those questions and you actually HAVE asserted your concerns and he just doesn't listen/care - then he's the AH, and you deserve better.", "Yta.  If you can afford a babysitter, it\u2019s a reasonable solution.  You both deserve time to yourselves.", "YTA - thats what babysitters are for.

No reason for either one of you to have to sacrifice free time and hobbies. I don't know if the father isn't comfortable watching the child alone or just doesn't want to give up his entire days worth of plans for 3 hours, but either way, being a parent does not mean that one is not allowed to hire a babysitter, in order to do something that the child cannot be involved in", "NTA and the number of hobbies you both have doesn't matter, it's the amount of free time you have.

If the two of you have the means, you find a sitter the kiddos like, and your husband spends quality time with the children at other times during the week, this is an amazing reprieve for both of you to have time for yourselves that most parents don\u2019t get.

Here it\u2019s about the division of labor during the weekend. While I think it\u2019s valid for you to hire a sitter if you both are busy at the same time.

This will hurt your kids in the long run. NTA", "ESH. The sheer volume of projection on this sub can be a little overwhelming sometimes. I\u2019m a dad and I had a similar conflict with my partner when my child was younger. It was a very overwhelming time and stressful for everyone. One of the things that kept me from completely detaching emotionally from the whole thing was the time I got with my physical \u201chobbies\u201d, in my case cycling. It gave me the alone time I needed to be present at home, working full time and doing childcare in the evenings. Was it perfect for everyone? No, but it could have been much worse if I didn\u2019t have that outlet. In hindsight my partner understands that my mental and physical health is our mental health and physical health. The only thing I would say to OP is that you need to claim the time you need to maintain yourself and put the burden on your husband to solve the logistical issues, babysitter, to provide for your needs.", "Why did you even have children?", "YTA- get the baby sitter. You and your partner need a break. There's no need to sacrifice when a sitter can solve the issue.", "NTA.

There is a huge difference between asking someone to skip part of a workout with a friend versus \"I want you to skip the championship tournament you have been competing for the last 9 months\"     HOWEVER, YTA for trying to force your husband  to spend time with the kids if he truly doesn't want to.   He is TA if he doesn't, but why would you want someone around your kids that doesn't want to be there?   He offered to hire a babysitter so you could have some time alone.   Now it is up to you to decide which is more important to you, having time off to yourself or having a babysitter watch the kids.", "Agreed. NTA, OP. Parenting is supposed to be a joint responsibility when there are 2 parents.

During the pandemic our office went virtually all remote and has stayed that way permanently) and I sometimes need an hour or 2 to read a book, watch a movie, go for a walk... it would really frustrate me if my husband wasn't willing/able to watch our son alone for a few hours so I could have a break.", "Sounds to me like he wanted to release his sperm inside something other than his hand, and the tax deduction for more $$ to spend on his hobbies.", "NAH", "They are both entitled to hobbies, but to him that means she takes care of the kid while he has his hobbies, or a babysitter takes care of the kid while he has his hobbies.

I do most of the child care and a little more of the house cleaning. If I need a break I will ask my husband and paint or even just take a hot bubble bath and read. When he needs a break he will ask and go hang out with his friend or  stay home and game. When their are two prenatal figures in a house they need to be able to communicate when they need a break.
