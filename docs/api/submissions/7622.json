At that time I said yes without really thinking it through. \n\nThey have since had a trip over to stay with us for two weeks which did not go well at all.

Go with who has been there for you. Have the convo with your dad and let him know he\u2019s not walking you down the aisle or staying with you.

A man does not have a right to walk her down the aisle (aside from the fact that it is an annoying, archaic tradition) just because he is a biological father.

There's no way your mother walking you -- which is great -- but not very traditional won't look like a slap to him.

Be prepared for a lot of argument from dad about the walk down the aisle. Don't buckle under pressure.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA", "NTA.

Not his, not your husband, not your mother, NO ONES DECISION BUT YOURS.", "NTA. Though you may want to uninvite him entirely from the wedding so he won't cause any more issues.
