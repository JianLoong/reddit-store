Don\u2019t let the school\u2019s choices damage the relationship you have with your family at such an exciting time!", "If there were a \"Everything sucks here\" or \"this situation is screwy\", I would choose that one. I think it depends on how much parenting has your stepmom done. I don't mean to offend, but it's worth remembering that most teenagers grow distant or disagree with their parents, and \"not being on the same page\" isn't itself a reason to be disrespectful. She might not be your *only* mom, but if she really did put the work in to help raise you, then you should acknowledge that she has mothered you more than your bio-mom. For the sake of your relationship with your current parents, I hope that you can help yourself from putting your bio-mom on a pedestal, fantasizing about some perfect life that would have been were she still around. You'll always wonder, but you have to make merry with the people you still have.\n\nI haven't lost a parent, so it's true that I can't relate on that front, but I *have* lost a lover. Of course, there are times when I wonder what we could have been, where we'd be today, but I'm careful not to sabotage my relationship with my current partner just because they're different people, because my current partner doesn't \"measure up\" in some sense or another. Just because our history starts at a more recent date doesn't mean that the love isn't real, that the relationship is worth less as a result.\n\nThis is all, of course, assuming that your step mom was respectful, that she didn't try to force herself in, and that she tried to meet you where you were. If she was, and she also did a significant amount of parenting, then I'm sure both she and your father would feel much more respected if she was less \"the step mom\" and more \"the mom who stepped up\".", "YTA.", "Info: Is she your legal guardian?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Father is trying to force him to list the new wife as his mom in his yearbook.  While it would be OK for OP to do that, it's not required.  And for father to try to force the issue is a true AH move.\n\nAlso, his mom didn't die during childbirth.  The son was five.  He remembers his mom VERY WELL.  And he still loves her very much.  Daddy can re-marry 20 times if he wants to.  The son will never stop loving his mom.  And he'll always have very vivid memories of her.", "The dad is trying to pressure and guilt-trip his kid into doing something he doesn\u2019t want to do. Obviously OP doesn\u2019t have that sort of relationship with his stepmom.", "Sorry, i thought you were OP", "Tbf, there are a lot of odd and unnecessary things done in the US, and I agree this is one of them. But it\u2019s odd *because* of the whole concept of being a teen who is coerced and cajoled into naming specific people like this and then piling shame and pressure on them when they just want to enjoy their last year of high school. OP doesn\u2019t want step mom\u2019s name in the graduation booklet. That should be the end of it.", "It depends on the relationship. No one should force some one to have any type of parent added, even bio parents can suck. I wouldn\u2019t want my SM because she didn\u2019t raise me, but I love her. And some people do love the stepparent who stepped in after the loss of bio parent."]}
