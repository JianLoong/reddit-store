Don\u2019t let the school\u2019s choices damage the relationship you have with your family at such an exciting time!", "If there were a \"Everything sucks here\" or \"this situation is screwy\", I would choose that one. I think it depends on how much parenting has your stepmom done. I don't mean to offend, but it's worth remembering that most teenagers grow distant or disagree with their parents, and \"not being on the same page\" isn't itself a reason to be disrespectful. She might not be your *only* mom, but if she really did put the work in to help raise you, then you should acknowledge that she has mothered you more than your bio-mom. For the sake of your relationship with your current parents, I hope that you can help yourself from putting your bio-mom on a pedestal, fantasizing about some perfect life that would have been were she still around. You'll always wonder, but you have to make merry with the people you still have.\n\nI haven't lost a parent, so it's true that I can't relate on that front, but I *have* lost a lover. Of course, there are times when I wonder what we could have been, where we'd be today, but I'm careful not to sabotage my relationship with my current partner just because they're different people, because my current partner doesn't \"measure up\" in some sense or another. Just because our history starts at a more recent date doesn't mean that the love isn't real, that the relationship is worth less as a result.\n\nThis is all, of course, assuming that your step mom was respectful, that she didn't try to force herself in, and that she tried to meet you where you were. If she was, and she also did a significant amount of parenting, then I'm sure both she and your father would feel much more respected if she was less \"the step mom\" and more \"the mom who stepped up\".", "YTA.", "Info: Is she your legal guardian?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
