Don\u2019t let the school\u2019s choices damage the relationship you have with your family at such an exciting time!", "If there were a \"Everything sucks here\" or \"this situation is screwy\", I would choose that one. I think it depends on how much parenting has your stepmom done. I don't mean to offend, but it's worth remembering that most teenagers grow distant or disagree with their parents, and \"not being on the same page\" isn't itself a reason to be disrespectful. She might not be your *only* mom, but if she really did put the work in to help raise you, then you should acknowledge that she has mothered you more than your bio-mom. For the sake of your relationship with your current parents, I hope that you can help yourself from putting your bio-mom on a pedestal, fantasizing about some perfect life that would have been were she still around. You'll always wonder, but you have to make merry with the people you still have.\n\nI haven't lost a parent, so it's true that I can't relate on that front, but I *have* lost a lover. Of course, there are times when I wonder what we could have been, where we'd be today, but I'm careful not to sabotage my relationship with my current partner just because they're different people, because my current partner doesn't \"measure up\" in some sense or another. Just because our history starts at a more recent date doesn't mean that the love isn't real, that the relationship is worth less as a result.\n\nThis is all, of course, assuming that your step mom was respectful, that she didn't try to force herself in, and that she tried to meet you where you were. If she was, and she also did a significant amount of parenting, then I'm sure both she and your father would feel much more respected if she was less \"the step mom\" and more \"the mom who stepped up\".", "YTA.", "Info: Is she your legal guardian?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Most of the time when people post here about these things there are some pretty wicked step-parents and these posts usually list the reasons why they feel this person shouldn't be involved in this or that, or be included on this thing or another.

You've been  dependent on her and your father for more than half your life in one way or another. She is your father's wife. I feel that both you and your father are right. You love your mom, you wanna cherish her memory. Your dad doesn't want you to feel like you can't honor her, but he also is fully aware of the struggles of raising a child that isn't yours, because he himself did it for the step-siblings you mentioned. \n\nAnd just because the child isn't your flesh and blood doesn't mean you can't form an emotional attachment to this person. From the way you speak she doesn't sound like a bad person in your eyes. You obviously want to cherish your mother's memory and your dad doesn't want his wife to be sad. Which I'll be honest, if I were a step-parent who put in the effort and had a decent relationship with the step-child, especially for as long as she has, I would be hurt to not be named in some context. It wouldn't devastate me. But it would hurt. \n\nWhich is where a compromise comes in. Have you tried speaking to your schools administration about altering your page a little?

Talk to your stepmom and tell her that you wanted to remember your mom, but you also want to honor stepmom by giving her a small token.\n\nYour dad can go chew rocks.", "NTA: It is wrong that the school is not allowing for you to honor both. Maybe you could be the one that makes change. The school is actually creating the drama - sounds like both your mom and stepmom should be recognized, especially since your stepmom has basically been with you during the school age years. This is sad that they are making you pick one or the other - so wrong of the school in many ways. You should be fighting for both of them and so should your dad.", "NTA Do you have the option of putting your mother's name and then in parenthesis your stepmother's name after your mother's?", "NTA.", "NAH here except a school that still only allows for standard normative family models instead of being inclusive of the various new family models. It's probably one of those enlightened schools where they also force foster home children to draw a family tree. How dare they put students in this shitty position. If you could name mom and step mom both as important family members, you wouldn't have this problem. Listen, both your dad and you have valid reasons for their wish. You say yourself you understand step mom would be hurt. Talk to your teacher and see if you may list and honor both of them.", "Nta. So he's more worried about upsetting his wife more than you, huh? It's sad that he's worried about hurting someone while hurting someone. Tell him he's being childish and that he needs to stop trying to tell you who your mom is and that maybe he should get therapy.", "Ugh, I am not going to say YTA because your have the right to feel how you feel. However, this just makes me believe that being a stepparent really is a thankless job. I don\u2019t think I could ever date a guy with kids if after 8 or 9 years of raising a kid I am told that my efforts and love was for not. I wouldn\u2019t want to feel less than in my own home. Being a mom is more than blood.\n\nSo, NTA, but it did also reaffirm in my mind never to date a single dad lol.", "NTA but if you and your dad can't come to an agreement maybe don't put any parents names in.", "NTA. Your father isn\u2019t threatening to ground you because you aren\u2019t thinking of the feelings of others. He wants to ground you because you won\u2019t put the feelings of others over your own when he wants you to. So don\u2019t let him make you feel that you\u2019re the bad guy here.", "NTA \n\nNo matter what age she died she is still your mom", "NTA. It's your yearbook and if you want to have your mother on it instead of your step mother, because that is not your relationship with her, that is your choice.\n\nYou father has to learn that you aren't a small child anymore and that you are going to make your own choices for your own reasons, even if he doesn't agree with them. He needs to understand that over the next few years, your relationship is going to change. He needs to step back and let you fly or fall on your own.", "INFO. Have you talked to your stepmom about this?", "NTA but speak to the school and see if you could get both listed. mum and stepmum.  Dad is focused on how his wife feels but not how you feel.", "NTA. \n\nDear gods another one of these.\n\nI'm so sorry.", "The graduation book should allow as many parent names as the student needs. OP is not the only student with more than two parents. I bet half the students have  more than two.", "NTA, but go ahead and talk to the teacher supervising this now. Your dad probably won't tell you when he calls to change it, so you should probably head it off if you don't want to be surprised", "NTA as soon as you can leave and go NC with your father.", "NTA", "NTA. I lost my mother when I was 7. I\u2019ve had my beloved stepmother since I was 8, I\u2019m now 45. My love and respect for my stepmother doesn\u2019t change the fact that my mother is my mother. It doesn\u2019t mean Iove my stepmom any less.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA at all. Your dad wants to change history, and it\u2019s completely inappropriate. You want your mom to be a part of the ceremony, and that\u2019s a beautiful thing.", "OP.\n\nYou are your own person. \n\nThere\u2019s a constant tug-of-war between \u201cyou\u2019re old enough now, go figure it out\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re my child, you\u2019ll do what I say\u201d in these years of life. \n\nFor the yearbook: if there\u2019s an option to include siblings, could you possibly have all three of their names on their? To be able to include, not replace? \n\nYour appreciation for your step mom and the love of your mom are two separate things. Nothing will ever change what your step mom has done for you, how she\u2019s helped, or the things she\u2019s been part of. There is of course a love for her as a big part of your life.\n\nBut she\u2019s not ***Mom.*** \n\nGiving that title away, especially when you\u2019re not ready to, is unfair to everyone involved. It may feel disrespectful to your mothers memory, it obviously doesn\u2019t make you feel good, and if your step-mom isn\u2019t a Disney villain, chances are good she doesn\u2019t want to force that on you either! \n\nI personally suspect your dad has some pretty big emotions surrounding this. That he just wants you to feel like everything is perfect now, and that putting your step-moms name on there officially makes you all One Big Happy Family. But it\u2019s not that simple. I\u2019m not sure what kind of relationship you have with your dad, but it might be worth probing a bit to see if when he said you were \u201churting someone for no reason\u201d he maybe meant himself?", "NTA, but it's crazy that in this day and age, your school doesn't make any allowances for families that aren't one mom, one dad. Our daughter recently graduated, and she was allowed to write a little blurb about her family, her accomplishments, her future plans, etc. for the graduation program. None of her loved ones had to be left out.", "NTA. Is your father aware of how many adult children are estranged from their surviving bio-parent for this exact shit? Your mom is your mom, he can't replace her and it's not your job to make your stepmother feel valued.", "And ironically enough he's worried about OP hurting someone's feelings.\ud83d\ude10\n\nNTA...but your dad is. I hope you're going away for college or your next adventure so you're out of that house. Congrats on your graduation. You survived HS!! \ud83d\udc99", "I wonder about exactly how this is structured in the \"book\" because it seems like there should be room or a way, to include the stepmother (not under the Mom category)...\n\ncould OP ask the teacher in charge about having it say -\n\nMother: Mother's name\nFather: Name and wife's name\n\nThe school must have dealt with non-traditional families before, there's probably a compromise here, if OP wants to get Dad off her back while still respecting her mother's place in her life.", "\"New wife\" as if he hasn't been with her for longer than his son ever even knew his bio mom.", ">I'd tell him he's very close to not talking to his daughter after she moves to college. \n\nI don\u2019t know about any daughter but OP is his son and he probably won\u2019t be talking to him either. \ud83d\ude09", "Of course they can but he said doesn\u2019t want to put her name down, that\u2019s the thing.", ">But what about those kids who are from single-parent families? What a way to guarantee they get bullied for the rest of their school years.\n\nHow is this going to cause bullying for an 18yo who just graduated?", "Haha right. Sounds just like my dad.", "The school sucks!\n\nThis is so unfair for anyone dealing with death, divorce, remarriage, guardianship situations, foster care, same-sex marriage (if you have two dads or two moms, who gets listed where?) or adoption or any other situation beyond married heterosexual parents with x amount of kids! I am certain that OP is far from the only student facing tensions regarding the stupid book!", "Your thoughtless comment implies that a child's love for his mom should naturally fade over time.\n\nI wouldn't blame the father for being very much in love with his new wife.  But the son can take as much time as he wants to process the loss of his mom, and in his own way.  He obviously still loves and misses his mom.  There is nothing wrong with that.   It just is.  And it says nothing at all about daddy's new wife.", "Maybe start making plans to help you be more independent by the age of 18 in case she tries to get you kicked out. For example, getting a part time job and getting your license if you haven't already.", "Yeah this. Turn 18, change your last name to your mother's maiden name. But I'm 100 percent that petty.", "Not saying he can't, but to say NTA makes his father TA, which just doesn't make sense. Calling his wife he has been with for at least almost a decade \"new\" is pretty disingenuous. The son can put his mom's name if he wants, but it isn't unreasonable to think that putting the name of the person who has been with you for most of your life through the hardships of teenage years and into college would make more sense than a bio mom you probably don't remember very well. NAH", "How is OP inconsiderate?\n\nOP, a teenager, should force down their emotions to make sure the step-mom, a middle aged woman, doesn\u2019t potentially get her feelings hurt\u2026 ***because he wants to pay respect and homage to his deceased mother?***\n\nThat\u2019s some seriously icky stuff. \n\nThe \u201cadults\u201d is perfectly okay forcing a 17yr old to shove all of this down, pile on the guilt, and threaten to ground him over expressing himself and his line in the sand\u2026\n\nbut make the 30yr old step mom accept that she\u2019s a step mom? LUDICROUS!", "OP is a guy.", "Eww, this is really cringe."]}
