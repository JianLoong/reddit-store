Don\u2019t let the school\u2019s choices damage the relationship you have with your family at such an exciting time!", "If there were a \"Everything sucks here\" or \"this situation is screwy\", I would choose that one. I think it depends on how much parenting has your stepmom done. I don't mean to offend, but it's worth remembering that most teenagers grow distant or disagree with their parents, and \"not being on the same page\" isn't itself a reason to be disrespectful. She might not be your *only* mom, but if she really did put the work in to help raise you, then you should acknowledge that she has mothered you more than your bio-mom. For the sake of your relationship with your current parents, I hope that you can help yourself from putting your bio-mom on a pedestal, fantasizing about some perfect life that would have been were she still around. You'll always wonder, but you have to make merry with the people you still have.\n\nI haven't lost a parent, so it's true that I can't relate on that front, but I *have* lost a lover. Of course, there are times when I wonder what we could have been, where we'd be today, but I'm careful not to sabotage my relationship with my current partner just because they're different people, because my current partner doesn't \"measure up\" in some sense or another. Just because our history starts at a more recent date doesn't mean that the love isn't real, that the relationship is worth less as a result.\n\nThis is all, of course, assuming that your step mom was respectful, that she didn't try to force herself in, and that she tried to meet you where you were. If she was, and she also did a significant amount of parenting, then I'm sure both she and your father would feel much more respected if she was less \"the step mom\" and more \"the mom who stepped up\".", "YTA.", "Info: Is she your legal guardian?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

More than half of marriages end in divorce, blended families are more common than ever, and modern schools somehow can\u2019t list parents *and* stepparents!?", "Could you put both?", "Info: Is anything stopping you from listing her as your stepmom? I included my stepparents always like this (mom + boyfriend, dad + wife). That way you would be including her. Or add her as a second mom like others suggested.", "Look, I don't know your particular circumstances, but can I ask why when she's been in your life for 10years she isn't like a mum to you? Is there an option to list your mum and then also your stepmom? Surely other kids have a situation like this too, or else what do adopted kids do? Or kids who are raised by their grandparents? If there is a legit reason to leave her out then fine it's your choice, but I figure it s a compromise that could keep everyone happy. Also NTA here but maybe try finding a way to not be an A at all.", "Correct he\u2019s very insecure! Same as my AH dad!", "NTA. \nYou should get to choose who you put as your mom in your school's graduation book. But it may be a nice thing to do - to tell your stepmom separately how much you appreciate her. Try to do it before the book is published, so she's not blindsided.", "Absolutely NOT!", "Not naturally. They have mother: father: siblings: and you can leave siblings blank but they only offer mother/father.", "That sucks.  Personally I\u2019d bring it up with the teacher and ask if you can make an exception and put both.  You shouldn\u2019t have to choose.", "Just talk to the school and maybe there's a solution to this where everyone could be included. Maybe you can get 2 separate books with your 2 families name", "He only wants his mom listed!", ">Whether or not you decide to show appreciation for your stepmom\n\nI agree with the other two points. But if someone has done work to help you that should be appreciated and you don't show appreciation appropriate to what they've done, it would make you an asshole. \n\nYou don't owe anyone reciprocity, but it's basic human manners to say thank you when someone helps you in a positive way. It would make you TA if you didn't. \n\nSo sure, you could let someone say help you change your tires after they blew up on the road and you were stranded, the drive off without a word, but you'd be a dick for not st least saying thanks and helping clean up.", "Seriously. Doesn\u2019t even think that OP might be sad that her mom isn\u2019t there for this major milestone in her life.", "As it often happens, when people are pushed to think of other person\u2019s feelings their own feelings and boundaries don\u2019t count at all.", "I stopped taking you seriously when you made clear you don\u2019t know what vacant means.  Here\u2019s the hard truth if the OPs father had not remarried, the OP would\u2019ve grown up without a mother since the age of 5. That means the role was vacant, nothing you say changes that fact. And the OP has stated that she has, so there\u2019s also that. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m on a high horse, it\u2019s that I can relate to the situation and don\u2019t believe in telling people it\u2019s okay to ignore the feelings of people that care about them. Because that\u2019s a good way of making sure they aren\u2019t there when next they need them. \n\nAnd for the record, I\u2019ve only been replying in hopes that OP sees them, and gives some actual thought to what I\u2019m saying. You all don\u2019t even know what vacant means and aren\u2019t qualified to be giving advice on a subject like this."]}
