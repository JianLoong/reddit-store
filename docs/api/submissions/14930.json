If you are having disagreements I understand that, I would just encourage you to reflect on if she\u2019s played a big role in your life. If you can say that yes, she has, then honestly I would contact the people pulling together this book and say hey - I need to include the names of both my mom and my stepmom. \n\nIt\u2019s 2023 - how they can possibly not account for non-traditional families is beyond me. Don\u2019t let the school\u2019s choices damage the relationship you have with your family at such an exciting time!", "If there were a \"Everything sucks here\" or \"this situation is screwy\", I would choose that one. I think it depends on how much parenting has your stepmom done. I don't mean to offend, but it's worth remembering that most teenagers grow distant or disagree with their parents, and \"not being on the same page\" isn't itself a reason to be disrespectful. She might not be your *only* mom, but if she really did put the work in to help raise you, then you should acknowledge that she has mothered you more than your bio-mom. For the sake of your relationship with your current parents, I hope that you can help yourself from putting your bio-mom on a pedestal, fantasizing about some perfect life that would have been were she still around. You'll always wonder, but you have to make merry with the people you still have.\n\nI haven't lost a parent, so it's true that I can't relate on that front, but I *have* lost a lover. Of course, there are times when I wonder what we could have been, where we'd be today, but I'm careful not to sabotage my relationship with my current partner just because they're different people, because my current partner doesn't \"measure up\" in some sense or another. Just because our history starts at a more recent date doesn't mean that the love isn't real, that the relationship is worth less as a result.\n\nThis is all, of course, assuming that your step mom was respectful, that she didn't try to force herself in, and that she tried to meet you where you were. If she was, and she also did a significant amount of parenting, then I'm sure both she and your father would feel much more respected if she was less \"the step mom\" and more \"the mom who stepped up\".", "YTA.", "Info: Is she your legal guardian?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It would be like saying \"You didn't carry me for 9 months so anything you try to do for me is worthless.\"   It's not true.  It's not productive.  It's hurtful for the sake of hurting. \n\nOP already clarified that they do not use the phrase in this context, but rather speaking specifically about the wording in the yearbook.", "Exactly. It\u2019s a shame but that\u2019s the dynamic at play unfortunately. Some kids accept stepparents as parents. Some don\u2019t. And it is up to the child in each situation to decide. The stepmoms/dads feeling aren\u2019t more important than OPs in this situation.", "Oh is that how you meant it! Didn\u2019t get that sorry - nah I was talking in terms of the year book.\n\n\nNo that should never be shouted as it is rude and hurtful- but even then at the end of the day\u2026 they\u2019re not their mother. Stepmom might be doing everything but sometimes a line still needs to be drawn if a child feels the need to. And especially if the child has made it clear that stepmom is stepmom and not mum."]}
