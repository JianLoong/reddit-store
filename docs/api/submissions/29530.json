My boyfriend told me about the plan he made with his brother (29m I think) to push their sister's face into the birthday cake during the cake-cutting. I asked him if that was a tradition in their family, and he said no, they just wanted to \"screw with her in a fun way\" on her birthday.

I kept telling him to not do it then, but he just told me it would be fine.\n\nI decided to tell my boyfriend's sister about it ahead of time so that she would duck if she needed to or something. She told me thanks for letting her know. Anyways my boyfriend and I went to her party yesterday, and my boyfriend and his brother were right next to their sister during the cake-cutting, and I saw their hands like behind her head as she was bending down to blow out the candles, and out of nowhere it was like she had eyes at the back of her head or something lol, she quickly got back up and maneuvered and I guess somehow she pushed the older brother(the 29m)'s face into the cake after he seemed to try to do it to her. It was pretty funny at the time since everybody but my boyfriend and his brother was laughing.\n\nAnyways, before we left the party, my boyfriend asked me if I tipped his sister off before the cake-cutting, and I admitted it and I told him I had to since it would be wrong to humiliate her on her birthday without her consent.

Especially when a lady has spent a lot of time, effort and money doing her hair and makeup and clothes for a special event. It's not like she can just go wash her face and rinse her hair like most men can.\n\nAlso, there are hard decorations and icing, candles etc that can be sharp.\n\nI read the story of the bride who only asked that her new hubby didn't do this, he did. She walked out. Had the marriage annulled. She was right.\n\nYesterday saw a video of someone coming in for the face smash while a friend had a sharp knife ready to cut the cake, the knife went in his eye.\n\nPeople need to stop doing this stupid shit and grow the fuck up.", "NTA, but consider this person that you're dating.  He would do this to you.", "NTA but remember that he will do this to you at your wedding and likely at your birthdays too because this is the type of thing he thinks is super funny and okay.

OP doesn't seem like the type to enjoy \"pranks\".", "yikes you probably hate men huh", "OP said that he knew his sister wouldn't agree to it if she knew which tells me this sort of thing wouldn't get a pass in their relationship.

Unless one absolutely knows it's something the person in question would want/be comfortable with/agree to it should never be done.", "If he expected her to laugh and not care, why was he disappointed when she slipped out of the way?", "Plus, it\u2019s actually dangerous when it\u2019s a wedding cake.

So you could poke somebody\u2019s eye out by smashing their face into a wedding cake.", "As they should be.  Two to three hundreds dollars' worth of professional makeup ... ruined.", "I did not take your remark as an exaggeration in any way.

Good luck with your boyfriend.", "If you ask my sister if she would agree with me jumping out from behind a wall and scare her she would say no.

In the history of cake smashing how often has that happened lol", "That's simple his plan backfired.", "Also true, any layer cakes have some sort of support, a lot use plastic straws now but many still use wooden dowels.", "Even birthday cakes have that if there are tiers! Apparently there have been a lot of ER visits because of that stupid trend.\n\nThankfully my partner and I don't think it's funny to humiliate each other so that's not a worry. I did say anyone who did that would end up hurt.", "Cakes aren't cheap either.  And who else would want to eat a cake after someone's face has been smashed into it?", "But surely it was just as funny when his brother got cakesmashed?  Because apparently cakesmashing people is funny.\n\nBoyfriend got *angry* with OP at first.", "Again his plan back fired . \n\nAlso love how you put angry italics by yet OP exact words was he got upset for a bit.  Upset could simply mean disappointed or sad. Doesn't always mean angry."]}
