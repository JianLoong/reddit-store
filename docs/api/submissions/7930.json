I was super excited because I love music. Over time I kind of became known as the 'piano guy' at school. I play at school concerts, accompany the school jazz choir, and play once a week for the residents at a couple of retirement homes in our town.\n\nWhen I was 15, I started to talk about quitting lessons, and my parents quickly tried to guilt me out of it. I told them I wanted to try other things, and that between piano and studying, I didn't have much time left for other extra curriculars. My Dad proposed a deal. If I kept playing and taking lessons until I reached level 10 RCM (Royal Conservatory of Music), and continued to keep my grades up at school, he would buy me a new car of my choice. I jumped at it and we shook hands on the deal.\n\nI should explain that my family is well off financially. I have a very privileged life, but I wouldn't say I've been spoiled. If I ever want a luxury item like a new phone or game console, I have to buy it myself with money I've saved from summer and after school jobs.\n\nI should also explain that my Dad's big on loopholes.  When we compete, he always finds a way to win, and when I do it doesn't count because of some loophole. It drives me nuts, but he thinks it's hilarious.  Whenever I complain about him not playing fair, his answer is always the same: life isn't fair.\n\nSo, because of our deal, I kept up with my lessons. I spent about 1-2 hours a day on piano, while keeping my grades up. Last summer, I took my level 9 RCM exams and passed, fulfilling my part of the deal. II told my Dad I'd chosen the BMW X5 plug-in hybrid SUV.\n\nA couple of months ago, on my birthday, I came downstairs for breakfast, and my Dad told me there was a surprise waiting for me in the garage. I ran out, and sitting in the middle of the floor was a 1/24 scale, toy BMW X5. My Dad burst out laughing and said, \"A deal's a deal, so as promised here is your brand new BMW!\" My heart absolutely broke. I asked if he was being serious, and he said I couldn't seriously have expected him to buy a 17 year old a real brand new BMW and that we could discuss getting me a reasonably priced used car. I said we had a deal and I fulfilled my end of it, he said he did too since I never said that the car had to be full size and drivable. I said he wasn't being fair. His response: life isn't fair.\n\nEver since this happened, I've been distant with my Dad. I honestly feel like he betrayed my trust and that he deliberately made a fool out of me. He keeps bringing up the idea of a used car, but I told him I'm not interested, which I admit is kind of petty. I have enough money saved that I can buy a cheap used car myself, and I just feel like if I accept one from him now it's like saying that breaking his promise didn't matter and that he didn't do anything wrong.

I don't necessarily disagree. That's a pretty expensive car for an inexperienced driver.

He was essentially manipulating you into giving up the opportunity to explore other interests- a healthy and normal thing for teenagers to do. I do think buying a teenager a brand new BMW is a bit much and somewhat foolish but that was on him for putting that into a deal with you. \n\nOne positive thing you can take away from all of his nonsense is that when you make a deal with people in the real world, be very clear on the details and get things in writing.", "Info: \n\nHave you always known your dad is rumplestiltskin or was it this instance that clued you in?\n\nNta", "NTA buy your own car and plan your life out without dad as a reliable backup or guide.

The deal was unrealistic and should never have been made in the first place. But you're young so you kind of got taken for a ride there. \n\nThat said, the only thing your dad's teaching you by exploiting that the way he has is not to trust people at all. The problem with that is most deals rely on trust, especially in business. There's no balance to an answer that's just 'Life's unfair, don't trust people.' Because don't trust people isn't a realistic option.\n\nIt's a bad life lesson and he's a dick. You can trust some people, your family should *ideally* be among those people, and life is in fact frequently a lot fairer than we have any right to expect.\n\nThat said your father has shown that he defects a lot from agreements, so... maybe don't trust him. He seems to think lying is proof of his cleverness rather than a character defect.", "NTA.  This was horribly manipulative but not entirely surprising based on your dad\u2019s history of using \u201cloopholes\u201d to come out on the winning end with you.  \n\nIn hindsight, unless your family is somewhat better than \u201cwell off\u201d financially, you were probably naive to expect a $70k car at 17.  But now you know what kind of man your father is.. a liar and a cheat.", "Wasnt this post recently posted with the exact same plot, just slightly different story?", "Nah Bro, you aren't the asshole. That was a shitty thing for him to do. Of course you thought he meant a real car and of course that is what he intended for you to think. I can kind of understand him changing his mind after thinking about it but if he did he owed you a conversation about it. Giving you a toy car and then laughing at you is a trust destroying move. At some point, we as parents and children have to be responsible for how we treat each other on an adult basis. And if we don't get treated properly we have to distance ourselves from them.", "I would be absolutely furious with a parent who knowingly deceived me like that. My trust would be broken with them, how can you ever believe them after that? You probably asked for a car that was way beyond what can be reasonably expected but your dad should have said that rather than pulling some little trick for his own amusement.

His dad pulling this manipulative move was just yet another play by his parents to manipulate OP into doing what they wanted him to do.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if the car is way too fancy for his first car. He\u2019s made it clear his dad is a manipulative person and finds loopholes to get out of rewarding his kid\u2019s achievements like a father should.
