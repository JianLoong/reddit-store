Very few people are going to live their whole life having sex with one and only one person.  You wait for marriage for sex.  You get divorced.  Have sex with many people after divorce.  What did you accomplish by waiting to get married to have sex?\n\nWell, you didn't experience sex in your 20's, when your health and energy were at their peak.  So if you insist on abstaining to the point where you have no sex in your 20s waiting for marriage?   You are a bit of an AH to yourself.  You will still have a similar body count.  You just shifted the timeline a bit.  And you deprived yourself of the experience of sex when your body was in peak condition for it.  (WHY would you DO that?!?!?!?)\n\nNote I'm not saying you have to have a lot of sexual partners in your 20s.  But as part of a relationship that otherwise is healthy?  No need to place artificial limits on sexual activity.  That's nuts.", "Hahahahaha!\n\nNTA\n\nI love it when purity culture encounters reality.

Both consenting adults from the ages given. But normally, yes. I think discretion was rather a wise move for them both, considering the family the young man is from. It would have (and now will) caused quite the uproar!", "Would you want to tell your super religious and abstinent friend that you and her \"abstinent\" brother were fooling around? Or even be like, \"Hey, I'm interested in your brother. Are you okay with that?\" They're consenting adults, and no one is asking for a hand in marriage. The most I would feel is bad that my friend felt the need to hide it from me.... then again, I don't judge adults for having a sexual life like she does.  \n\n Asking or informing is not going to go over well in any case, lol. So no foul there imo. She is 100% an A H for exposing the poor guy like that to his ultra religious family, though.", "OP already said that her thing with the brother was a fling. This guy isn't the love of her life or her future serious partner. That being the case, I really don't see why she had to look to her best friend's sibling for a casual hookup. \"Morally gray\" or not, that's a weird move. Don't fuck your best friend's sibling unless you know for CERTAIN that your friend would be cool with that. It's not that complicated.", "Apologies for potentially coming off harsh, but have you heard of the judgement ESH? I think it fits as both OP and the Friend were kind of TA", "Still pretty uncool to fuck your best friends sibling, could cause unnecessary drama if breaking things off isn\u2019t smooth", "you clearly havnt ever been in a religious family.

They're the one bringing it to the table. We aren't at a family gathering, we aren't in a mall with children running around. There's NSFW threads here in the AITA subreddit, so the idea that you *must* censor yourself despite talking about it is silly at best\n\nWe all know what they're saying, so censoring it looks more immature than not given the setting", "That's what I mean. Any friend who mentions religion to you outside of a third party discussion - as in they try in any way to force or express their beliefs when it's not welcome or requested - is acting coercively and is not a friend.\n\nReligion is fine.

So flipping the script on genders doesn\u2019t work here. A man who gets caught having premarital sex might be shunned, but he wouldn\u2019t be murdered. So for me, it\u2019s not equivalent.

When you start telling other people what they can't do because of your religion, you become the asshole.", "It's often difficult for people to ever feel comfortable with sex/masturbation/their own naked bodies after taking purity culture seriously. Even after marriage. Imagine hooking up with someone who hasn't been religious in a decade, but when making out turns into disrobing, they break down and have a panic attack. It's not a good time for anyone.", "I can tell you my experience. I will just tell you a little. when I had sex outside of marriage at 18 for the first time it nearly killed me because it changed my whole life and now I was not pure anymore. How could I look at god again? I do not know where to start but basically it was like walking through hell after that (in a very negative an emotionally damaging way)", "I'm starting to fall for him a bit, though, I have to admit. I think he feels the same, but we haven't mentioned it to each other. It'll never go anywhere now, though, after what just happened.", "ESH?

I don't really care who my siblings are fucking as long as there's no cheating and everyone is a consenting adult.", ">you clearly havnt ever been in a religious family. \n\nI had a very strict Catholic upbringing.  Even as a small child forced to go to mass multiple times a week (our family did weekday mass, also), I had questions.  Like, I didn't totally swallow the Kool-Aid.  I know before I finished grade school I was severely punished (grounded for several months) for stating my opinion that there might not be a power higher than man.  I learned to keep my thoughts to myself until I could get emancipated (prior to finishing high school).  I had many reasons for not wanting to live at home anymore, not the least of which was having ultra-religious dogma forced down my throat constantly.   \n\nMy point?  Being brain-washed requires a bit of cooperation.  It's not the religious girl's family that forces her to be religious.  She was just gently nudged in that direction.  If she has no mind of her own, that is how she will end up.  If she does have a mind of her own, she might still turn out to be just like her family.  It depends on her tolerance for Kool-Aid poisoning.  \n\nShe has bigger problems to worry about than what her family thinks of her.  She's a young adult now, responsible for her own behavior.  That goes for her brothers, also.  If they are so afraid mom and dad might unleash the wrath of imaginary space creatures on them...  \n\nThen that points to an unforgiveable level of incompetence in raising children.  And that comment has nothing to do with religion.  Religious or otherwise, kids have to be prepared to survive on their own, assuming that mom and dad won't always be around to help them.  If they are in their 20s and have no ability to form independent thoughts  / make good decisions yet?  FAIL\n\nBrother shouldn't be worried about being outed.  He should see it as a golden opportunity to start acting like an adult.  Meaning, he can face mom and dad and tell them the truth without shame, even if that might piss off the parental figures.", "boredpanda also censors controversial words.(esp in comments ) and also their lazy \"authors/bloggers\" take content from here daily. they steal a lot of r/cat, r/dog, & other pets pics from people posting. \n\n**yes, i'm aware this has nothing to do with the post. just soooo annoyed.**", "What does that have to do with anything?

I've seen people get disowned for less.", "omg 100% i once got a comment removed for writing in a polite manner the term that one uses to refer to a man that behaves like a child (as in hyphenate both words) apparently that was too much. I felt embarrassed but then thinking about it I was mostly puzzled", "Sir this is a Wendys..", "i agree nothing wrong with that. also... so because she fucks she shouldnt be able to censor herself when she uses vulgar language??? how isnt that dumb as shit.", "What is he doing to disrespect her? They both clearly enjoy doing it, or they wouldn\u2019t be doing it.", "Exactly! It's weird in the comments how so many people are solely focused on why one of them (either OP or the friend) are the asshole in this situation.", "Found the friend.", "Are we really calling women Jezebels in 2023?", "I already answered an almost identical response.", "no! this is PATRICK!", "Can't help but feel like you're willfully missing the point here.
