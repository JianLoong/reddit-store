Very few people are going to live their whole life having sex with one and only one person.  You wait for marriage for sex.  You get divorced.  Have sex with many people after divorce.  What did you accomplish by waiting to get married to have sex?\n\nWell, you didn't experience sex in your 20's, when your health and energy were at their peak.  So if you insist on abstaining to the point where you have no sex in your 20s waiting for marriage?   You are a bit of an AH to yourself.  You will still have a similar body count.  You just shifted the timeline a bit.  And you deprived yourself of the experience of sex when your body was in peak condition for it.  (WHY would you DO that?!?!?!?)\n\nNote I'm not saying you have to have a lot of sexual partners in your 20s.  But as part of a relationship that otherwise is healthy?  No need to place artificial limits on sexual activity.  That's nuts.", "Hahahahaha!\n\nNTA\n\nI love it when purity culture encounters reality.

Hope that stunned look on her face was worth your relationship. It was incredibly shitty of you to reveal something that might potentially get him in trouble with his family. He did nothing wrong, and now he'll be treated like he did, thanks to you.", "YTA. \n\nYou don\u2019t talk about your sex life with others especially if it can cause harm to someone involved. Some religious families take sex very seriously and can retaliate against him. \n\nI know tv makes it out that men love to talk about sex but honestly, girls are the worst offenders. Keep it in the bedroom.", "ESH Your friend because it's fine to have your own beliefs just don't force it onto others or judge them.\n\nYou because you already know your friend's beliefs and it's safe to assume the parents are the same way as well. You just dropped a bombshell in the brother's life just to prove your friend wrong.\n\nAlso what if you messed things up for yourself? The brother to cover his own behind might say nothing happened and that you were being obsessive and wouldn't let him be and created lies. Not saying he'll do that but anything is possible especially if the person is pushed to a corner.", "YTA. I come from a very religious family (I am not) and this makes me nauseous. You may have just caused so many problems for the brother, just to spite your obnoxious friend (who is also an AH, yes). This just was not the way to handle things.\n\nETA: If this is your \u201cbest\u201d friend (and she sounds unbearable, so personally I would reconsider that), it\u2019s kind of weird to start sleeping with her brother behind her back no matter what, anyway.", "ESH. You suck for betraying his trust, she sucks for being a holier than thou judgey loser.", "ESH.  Your friendship sounds like a farce.  You are both judgmental about each others lifestyle choices.  Newsflash, you are separate individuals with the freedom to make your own life choices.  That doesn\u2019t make either of you right or wrong.  Secondly, outing the situationship with her brother just to prove something is super shitty.  He should have input in whether to tell her or not.", "ESH. Your friend sounds super judgey but you exposed a secret that her brother clearly didn\u2019t want her to know so for that your an asshole.", "I'm going with YTA it's usually common sense not to sleep with your friends brothers. Double points for doing it in secret.", "Yta friends don\u2019t bone friends siblings. Maybe stop talking about sex", "ESH. Her for being judgemental towards you for having a sexual life, but if you were going to fuck her brother and not tell her (which is problematic on itself), you should have stick with not telling her. Instead you outed him out of spite.", "I mean you and her brother decided not to tell her and then you told her anyway so that a bad right there because of the brother not because you told her.", "YTA, but at least you didn't pop an actual bubble. Silver linings, right?", "ESH except the brother. You shouldn\u2019t have outed him in this.", "ESH\n\nY.T.A. for fucking her brother and not saying anything. Sure it's your personal business, but also it is her business because that is her brother. Like, outside of her being an asshole about pushing her religion in your face, that is still very much her brother; fucking your friend's brother is universally kind of weird and something you should very much talk about.\n\nedit: It's always the super innocuous sounding titles huh", "YTA for doing this to both of them", "Actually it\u2019s not a gray are they are adults who made a choice.", "Nope they are adults and can do what they want with each other.", "Nope they are adults who can do what they want with each other.", "While I do agree that OP is the asshole for sharing intimate details of her friend's brother's sex life, I think it's perfectly clear that the so-called best friend is also an asshole.

I am aware that OP was being spiteful and purposefully trying to inflict pain when she spilled the secret in the moment. It\u2019s just that I did not acknowledge that part because I was looking more at the action than the intention. The part about OP being kind was me referring to her trying to *keep* the secret rather than spill it. \n\nAnd because of this, I want to thank you for explaining your perspective on the matter.", "...I think I'm malfunctioning. I understand exactly what you're saying, I've just never seen unrealistic used that way in a sentence before. But it makes sense! You are broadening my literacy horizons!\n\nI don't want to assume anything, as there's a whole load of possibilities as to why her reaction may come across as disproportionate or unrealistic. Without knowing more about the sister, we can't really judge her as anything other than an A H for pushing her religious beliefs down the throat of her friend.\n\nHowever, I still read OPs post as coming across spiteful due to the language she's used, and the time she chose to reveal her fling, which is why I think she's the A H here. Two wrongs don't make a right.", "FWIW, I agree with everything you just wrote.  It was kind of spiteful.  However,  she had the power to be spiteful as her companion had unrealistic expectations of human behavior.  In other words, if her friend had been living in the real world, there is no way that OP could have been spiteful, regardless of motivation or effort.\n\nTo the average person in conversation with a buddy, buddy says...\"OH by the way I am your brother's FWB\".  The average person?  Files it away in the back of their mind as an interesting bit of trivia.

I very much agree that while we can't control the actions of other people, we can control how we react, so ill intentions won't affect us.\n\nI'm finding you a very interesting person to talk to, but I'm now risking going down a rabbit hole which probably has no business being on this thread.
