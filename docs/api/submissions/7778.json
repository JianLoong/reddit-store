And not that you need any endorsement from anyone else, but I - for one - am glad to have you and am happy you feel at home here.\n\nYour parents didn't raise you here under duress. There are practical reasons they came here. Consequently, it's not surprise you also see the practical reasons you prefer the US to Nigeria.\n\nAt the end of the day, your parents are probably Nigerian people who like the idea of their country and who strongly identify with their native culture -- and they probably imagined (as many parents of all cultures errantly do) that their children would just naturally grow into carbon copies who share those values. They are surprised  and offended that their choice to raise you here has meant that you... are American. See yourself as American. Feel at home in America. And they probably feel some mixture of shame and regret for that fact. But it is what it is. You are right - they are wrong.\n\nBut real talk -- don't go to Nigeria again with your family.

It might be important to them, but it's not to you, and that was because of their choices.

They need to be more understanding of the consequences of that, and manage their expectations.", "NTA. I've always seen culture as a warm blanket, something that is offered and available from day one. It defines our values, and customs, and how we interact with the world. It provides guidance for times of trouble and ways to celebrate times of happiness. \n\nFor better or worse, you're part of the American culture. I suspect that there's a lot of Nigerian culture being mixed in, but you are not Nigerian. Your experience in Nigeria was negative and it has very little tie to you. So, for your family to force it on you is not in line with how I view culture. I hover the line between not the ah and no ah here just because for a lot of people, \"American culture\" is seen as negative. They come here for a variety of reasons, but our culture may seem antithetical to their culture.

What happened? \n\nThat alone is enough for me to say NTA. Normally I\u2019d say you should go, it might be a good experience this time, your parents want you to be in touch with your cultural roots, etc. But if there\u2019s a fear that you might not be able to come home anytime soon I wouldn\u2019t want to go either. Also yes you are American. That\u2019s your home, it\u2019s where you were born and raised, it\u2019s basically all you know.\n\nETA: since you mentioned the mosquitoes, if you end up going, insist that they take you to the doctor and allow you to get a prescription for anti-malaria pills. Take them every day. My ex boyfriend got malaria from refusing to take the pills and it was the sickest I\u2019ve ever seen someone who wasn\u2019t terminally ill.

My bf was born and raised in Nigeria and he and I have talked at length about how to help our future children embrace the Nigerian and American sides of themselves. The conclusion we came to is that have to be actively involved in making that happen. It sounds like you parents didn\u2019t do that and don\u2019t want to. They want their child to embrace their culture without doing the work to make that happen.", "I understand their pov: their child doesn't see their own country as their home too. But, honestly, that's on them.\n\nYou weren't taught the language, you weren't taught the customs and to love Nigeria. You were there once for a month and the experience wasn't that great. Why would you feel Nigerian? \n\nNTA", "OP,  I am judging you NTA because you are so young, and you lack perspective that comes with growing up as the adult child of immigrants, and you certainly don't mean to hurt anyone. But I do want to give you a bit of advice:\n\nI'm 32 and my parents are from India. They moved here before I was born so I am an American citizen and have lived here all my life. However, my mother made a HUGE effort to help me feel connected to our culture and my family back there. Even though I don't see them often, I feel close with my cousins and other family members because I got to spend quality time with them during visits. I'm sorry you haven't had a good experience in Nigeria, and I understand that in that regard, our experiences have been wildly different. You don't have as strong of a basis for feeling connected as I've been lucky to have.\n\nHowever, the thing is, people like us are never going to be fully \"American.\" We're not white (and unfortunately to a significant portion of people American = white), our parents have accents, our families live on the other side of the world, our homes are... different: different decorations, food smells, traditions. You're never going to escape the tinge of Nigerianness in your life even if you want to. Other people are always going to see it in you, and you're always going to be the child of Nigerian immigrants. It's an inescapable fact and it will make it difficult to fully assimilate into \"American culture.\"\n\nRegardless of how you feel about your parents or the actual country of Nigeria, you are going to have to figure out what to do with your own Nigerianness. You must find a way to integrate it into your sense of self in order to develop strong self-esteem and a strong sense of self. When I was a kid I had some internalized racism because I kept focusing on how my Indianness made me different and not able to fit in. I didn't like doing things like wearing gold jewelry because it made me look \"too Indian.\" \n\nHowever, as I got older, this started to change. This is partially due to American society's increasing embrace of different cultures and types of people. I started to feel more proud to be Indian, wanting to wear Indian clothes, listen to Indian music, etc. I am still very much American\u2014but I'm not just American, I'm Indian-American. That is a whole identity unto itself. It's not a mix of the two, it's its own distinct thing. Finding community with other Indian-Americans helped me realize we're actually a new type of culture, not a hodgepodge mish mash of conflicting cultures.\n\nLearning more about the history of the world helped me appreciate my ancestors' struggles as well. Nigeria and India were both colonized, and ravaged, by the British. I learned that I had a great-(great?)-grandmother who stood up to the British in her village. I learned about how my grandparents worked hard to start businesses during the upheaval of the last decades of colonialism. These are the people who came before me\u2014they did not live in America. In fact, due to the caste system, I can confidently say my ancestors have been in the exact same place for 2000+ years and it's rather remarkable that my parents broke that chain. I am forging a new path for my lineage from one country to another.\n\nI firmly believe that having a strong sense of self, of heritage, of identity, and feeling proud and accepting that is a vital part of any human's well-being. I think a lot of problems can come from instances when a person feels ashamed of who they are. You don't have to experience Nigerianness the same way your parents do\u2014of course, you can't, because you are a completely different person with different experiences. And honestly they might not even understand that. You don't have to do anything you don't want to. But I do recommend you find a way to understand your cultural heritage, integrate it into your identity, and feel proud of where your people came from, and where you are now. Ultimately, that is what your parents want for you, even if it takes a form they don't expect.\n\nI hope this helps, and you can PM me if you want to talk further. I really feel for you\u2014being a teenager is tough, and being a child of immigrant parents is doubly tough\u2014and I hope you find happiness.", "NTA. There's a breakdown in communication. If Nigeria is important to your parents, you should try to understand why. But it doesn't mean you have to go live there, does it? You also know not to go to Nigeria again just in case your passport conveniently goes missing...", "NTA - they want to share their culture and help you know where you came from, not terrible.

Wanting you to understand and respect your heritage is not a bad thing.  Of course where they grew up is important to them the same way that the US is important to you too, but their history there goes back much farther than yours does.  You should also recognize the differences you focus on are solely because you were raised here.  If you were raised there, it would probably not bother you as much as it would be normal for you.  You might be able to mitigate their feelings by asking them about growing up there and their traditions as well as learn more of the language.  It never hurts to be multilingual if you are able.  They could try to make you stay there if you go back, so that alone would be a reason to try to refuse, but you are a minor.

It's totally possible the kids all get to stay together with kind and loving resource/foster parents.  It could also end up worse because the siblings don't have each other to rely on. They could get put with different families and possibly even group homes for the older kids (I've heard absolute horror stories from students who have lived in them). About half of the students I've had who spent time in foster care said the foster home was more abusive and scary.  Mind you, some also get loving wonderful people supporting them. It basically seems to come down to luck.  \nIf the system was safe and worked like it's supposed you absolutely should report everything, but it's not and people who can, need to think carefully.  \nI'm a teacher and therefor a mandatory reporter. I encourage kids to talk to me about anything, but I do remind them there are things that I have no choice but to report, even if it's not my best judgment.  \nDefinitely not saying don't report. Absolutely report if you fear violence can escalate.   \nAlso, CPS doesn't always intervene the way they should. Kids get taken away from parents that probably just need some coaching or did nothing wrong (especially if they aren't white in certain regions) all the time and kids get put back in dangerous situations all the time, with parents who are just pissed at the kids for tattling.  \n\n\nSome people seem to think that parents can't ship their kids off to wherever they want (for the most part) and have complete legal control over their passports. Kids get sent off to live with relatives and in boarding schools they don't want to go to ALL THE TIME. Hell, all you have to do is say your kid has behavior problems and you can pay people to (legally) abduct your child to bring them to f-d up reform schools, that are ridden with abuses. It's not right, but it's how it is.  \n\n\nWhen I was 15 I could totally support myself, but I couldn't move out because my parents would threaten everyone with \"harboring a runaway.\" (Luckily i was able to graduate early and parents can't really keeps teens from college...).   \n\n\nSadly, kids have very few rights :(", "As someone born in the USA, it could be very dangerous for you to go to Nigeria, even if this is your parent's original homeland. \n\nYou're in a bad position, because you're only 13 years old.

In the Americas citizenship given based on geographical place of birth was justification and basically a vehicle to onit the moral dilemma of taking land from natives.

Children are not supposed to like, or even agree with, everything their parents decide for them. It is also important to have an open mind. The \"brainwashing\" comment is a little much and I don't think that should have been said. I also think that having an education about your family's culture and homeland will not change your adjustment here.

I was like you around your age, OP. I'm now 28 years old. In my early 20s I realized that I would never be fully white even though I'm a ginger who's quite whitepassing. Its an identity thing and I think you might do your parents as well as future you a favour to learn to integrate your Nigerianness into your identity. I know a lot of stories of people like us who choose to neglect their ancestry and consider themselves completely white only to have that bite them in the ass later as they realize they never completely will be and won't be seen that way either. I hated my cultural heritage and how it was a developing country. I didn't want anything to do with it. But learning to come to terms with it and learning to love it did a lot for me.\n\nI think your parents could mean well. It might be in your own best interest to learn that every culture has value and can be beautiful, Nigeria included, and to find value in your heritage as well.", "The thing is that they dont allow me to watch nollywood movies, they speak to me in english since I dont know their language, my dad is too busy calling his clients since he is a lawyer and often go to business trips, my mom goes to work in the night and because of that she either rest or do her work online in the morning since she is a nurse and I was once interested in it when I was 9 but lost interest over time.", "Uh, no, she won't.

Maybe a teacher or a friend\u2019s parent?  \n\nIf and only if you\u2019re physically safe, then my suggestion to you would be to keep your head down, be respectful, and make as few waves as possible - right now your parents have total authority over you, and shows of rebellion are likely to only increase the chances that they will try to send you back to Nigeria.  As soon as you are old enough to get a job, do. As soon as you can open your own bank account, do.  Prepare as much as you can to be able to support yourself once you are an adult.  It sucks that you have to think this way as a child, but on the other hand it will do you no harm to develop a good work ethic and financial responsibility.", "If they ever try to force you to travel there, hide a spoon on your body somewhere so it will trigger the metal detector at the airport.

He's reprehensible", "That's some serious info you didn't put in your original post, OP. I'm trying to understand why your parents would send you to Nigeria and not even teach you the language.

I wish I had a more helpful answer.", "It\u2019ll be hard because OP is only 13. But yea they should honestly refuse to get on a plane.
