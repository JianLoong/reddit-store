Yes, teenagers do stupid shit, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't be punished for them. He put his own, his boyfriend's, and other people's lives in danger. You going off at him was only natural, I can't imagine how scared and angry you must have been \n\nHave another (calmer) conversation with him tomorrow. Make sure he understands what he did was not ok and that it won't happen again. Good luck", "Your kid is lucky you didn't press charges for theft. I think yelling was in order.\n\nNTA", "NTA - No, you needed to make him cry. That was incredibly reckless.", "NTA it\u2019s not only irresponsible but EXTREMELY dangerous. Sometimes as a parent you do need to put your foot down.", "NTA. Having been in a motorcycle accident, I can assure you hard words hurt less than hard pavement.", "NTA. Not only did he endanger his bf and himself, he could have have killed someone else too!  On top of that multiple laws were broken and you might end up having to pay for his actions yourself. You 100% should have made his ass cry. \n\nI got arrested when I was 14 (long story but it was for trespassing and I was handcuffed and had to do a mugshot and everything.) ..In no way did the actual act of getting arrested teach me a damn thing lol but the fear I had for my mom did. The entire time I was thinking \u201cmy mom is gonna kill me, my mom is gonna kill me, my mom is gonna kill me.\u201d ..You did the right thing.", "NTA - With a caveat. Teo definitely did deserve a talking-to and the reality check; of course yelling isn\u2019t *ideal,* neither is keeping the talk going for longer than necessary, but I understand that it came from a place of you being afraid for his safety. I think the reaction you had was very understandable given the circumstances.\n\nI think after you\u2019ve had time to cool down, you\u2019ll want to sit down with Teo and explain *why* you reacted the way you did. If you did feel you may have been too harsh, you can apologize for that. We can be right in our sentiment but still wrong in our delivery. Make it clear that getting that call was extremely scary for you and you only want him to be safe, that you want to be able to trust that he\u2019s capable of making good decisions, that you believe over time he can earn that trust back.", "NTA. Your son stole your bike. Yes, he was arrested, but that's a consequence of his own actions. You are right that he could've been killed or seriously injured, or he could've killed or seriously injured someone else.", "NTA. You're his parent not best friend. You did nothing wrong going off on him.", "Your wife is a *very* soft touch if a few tears made her forget the thieving, reckless driving, street racing, child endangerment, and potential loss of college scholarship. Teo needed to hear *everything* you said because he came within an inch of ruining his life, killing someone, and bankrupting you. NTA", "NTA and your wife is too soft", "NTA at all. \n\nI'd even make him repay you (part of) the fine. In installments if needs be.", "NTA\n\nYour kid could have killed himself and others. He isn't licensed, wasn't insured and stole from you, he knew he was in the wrong and if he wasn't ready to cry at the police station after her got picked up, he clearly hadn't been through enough that night.\n\nOn a related note, if you aren't using it and aren't going to now, get rid of it, that way you have removed  temptation and it is clear to your son that he isn't ever going to be given it.", "NTA. What were you supposed to do, give him a pat on the back and a cookie?  Make him earn every penny to pay the fines and maybe no recreational driving until all is paid.", "NTA.  Yelling at him for doing something incredibly unsafe is appropriate in the moment.  It would be better if today you had a calmer discussion about why this was a terrible idea, but don\u2019t baby him.  You\u2019re not correcting a child, you\u2019re correcting a young man.  I guess you already know that you need to secure your bike keys.", "NTA! I'm normally a person who advises against yelling at a child when angry, but in this case, you were absolutely justified! Hopefully, Teo's crying indicates he realizes how serious his stupid actions were! I don't even CARE about the BF's scholorship. They both could have been seriously injured or killed. Worse, they could have injured or killed an innocent bystander.\n\nDO NOT allow your wife to minimize the severity of him doing this!!! Do not pay his fines. Make him pay for them himself. If that means he needs to get a job to pay his fines, so be it.", "NTA. Teo is suffering the consequences of his actions. Fortunately those consequences are just you chewing him out and whatever legal repercussions are coming. Much better than being a long stain on the highway. \n\nI knew someone that was shot and killed during a street racing incident. It's not a safe thing to do and people compound it with extra stupid actions. Secure your keys and/or sell your bike, because Teo has definitely shown that he's capable of poor decisions.", "NTA - your son was totally irresponsible and could have killed both himself and his boyfriend.  Your wife is being too soft, would she prefer planning a funeral for her son and losing everything when being sued by the boyfriends parents.", "As long as you follow up with the more heartfelt concerned conversation about how it would kill you and his mother if you lost him and you yourself cry to drive home the importance of what you\u2019re saying and make it more about love than control you will not be the AH.  But today there needs to be the calmer heartfelt truth conversation that talks about your reasons that are personal to you and your wife.  How it would affect you if you lost him.  How it hurts you that he broke your trust.  How hurt you are.  Show that it\u2019s not just about being mad.  It\u2019s about being scared yourself and being hurt and not understanding why he did it.  It\u2019s about feeling like a failure of a parent.  Etc", "NTA\n\nBut why would you apologize to mark's parents? HE did this as much as your son did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut scolding him is not going to help. Get him a good lawyer instead.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

This needed a good yelling so he knows you are serious. I hope that wasn\u2019t the only punishment and you now lock up keys since you know he sneaks out and is a thief.", "NTA\nHe endangered himself and his boyfriend, as well stole your property.", "Nta.

But try to talk to him, he is old enough to see and understand his mistakes.", "I\u2019m firmly in the gentle parenting/talk to your kids camp, but my one exception is when the consequence of not getting the message across might be death. Kid likes to wrench free and run into traffic? Yelling. Kid steals your motorcycle he doesn\u2019t know how to ride and decides to fucking race it? Yelling. Better for the kid to bitch about you in therapy later. At least he\u2019ll be alive to do it. \n\nNTA.", "Nta - my brother's 20 year old friend just died street racing on a motorcycle.

Also try to talk to him again when you\u2019ve calm down. The message will go along better with a clearer head too.

So yeah, he can press charges.", "If it was just yelling, then totally NTA, but the post is written a little vaguely that it makes me worry that something is being left out.", "It\u2019s not written vaguely at all.

Why would the PARENT be responsible for their kid stealing a bike (motorcycle), riding w/ out a license, reckless endangerment, etc., & paying the fines from the kid's theft?", "NTA your son is a thief, and a danger to society using your bike. You don\u2019t talk to him. You scream sense into him. It\u2019s not like you beat him. Tell the others to hurt out of your parenting or you will yell at them too.", "NTA.\n\nGetting yelled at to the point of crying is pretty light compared to death, either his or someone else's.\n\nAs others have said, a talk and figure out some consequences once everyone's had some time to cool off, but unless you got super mean and personal the NTA stands.", "I work in a hospital in an area that hosts a very large motorcycle rally every summer. The amount of people if all ages that come mangled, dead, or irreparable because they were drunk, got hit by someone who was drunk, werent wearing protective gear, were just plain stupid or even all four was insane but not surprising.

You did good.", "When I took my fathers car without permission and got caught, he left me in jail for the weekend", "NTA.\n\n1) My best friend and her mother were killed last year by assholes who were street racing so I\u2019m biased but also\u2026\n\n2) According to the NHTSA, motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death for people between the ages of 16 and 20.\n\nThe \u201cyou could have killed yourself and others\u201d thing isn\u2019t overblown.  Definitely agree with the folks saying that you should have a calmer sit down with Teo to explain the gravity of his actions.

Two needed a HUGE reality check how stupid this was. And I doubt you had 2 helmets just lying around. Was I young and stupid once? Of course. It's how I learned of drunk driving. Went out on my birthday got plastered, woke up in my bed and didn't remember driving home. That was 30 years ago and I never drive if I've had alcohol to this day. Ground him until June 1st while making him understand why what he did was not cool bro.

The parents have no say on whether charges are pressed or not beyond reporting it stolen.", "Made his son tear up. It's mentioned in the post", "NTA.  Your kid stole your bike and went street racing.  He got himself arrested and is apparently being charged for it.  Oh, no.

But that knowledge works both ways! If you had been able to be low-key, Teo would know he did not FU that badly.  Now that you were really mad, it drives home the point that he really really FU real bad. \n\nIf you yourself deem to have gone overboard, maybe also because of Teo's reactions in a couple of days, you can maybe tell him that you wished you could have toned it down but that you were not able to, because of worry and all what-if's - because he truly really FU, but that does not necessarily mean you don't love him any more ....", "NTA", "NTA if that was my kid they would be getting a part time job to pay me back $50 per week/or paycheque (depending on minimum youth wages).", "NTA- your wife think he\u2019s been through enough by getting arrested ??\n\nThose kids could have ended up a bloody smear on the highway .\n\nShe should be happy this is the worst thing that happened to them .\n\nScold him all you want .", "NTA and Teo's lucky he didn't donate some fresh corneas and organs to someone maybe a little more deserving.", "NTA but it all depends just how much you went off on him.  Yelling at him about the risks and recklessness of it all is fine.  \n\nMaking a child cry is not by default a sin, maybe Teo has been spoiled a bit, obviously he has, if he thinks stealing a bike like that was ever acceptable.", "NTA", "NTA. The majority of bad motorcycle accidents happen due to the drivers inexperience.  Lock up your bike keys. He's proven he can't be trusted. Period. That's a huge violation of your trust. It will take a while to earn it back. \n\nMake sure he pays the fines, though. Make him get a job to pay you back.", "Oh no the poor thing cried!!!! Thank god you reprimanded him accordingly, many parents sugarcoat it like your partner would\u2019ve done. If he didn\u2019t cry, you probably weren\u2019t yelling hard enough", "NTA.  He could have killed both himself and his boyfriend, and he DID incur serious fines for which you will be held responsible AND endanger his boyfriend's future.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily condone yelling and screaming, but no, the embarrassment of getting arrested is far from punishment enough.\n\nIf he has any luxury items (video game consoles, mountain bike) of significant value that could be sold to pay off some of the fines, it should be.  Not like a college fund or something he needs, but luxury items that he can work to replace.  As it is, you probably already need to sell the bike.", "NTA, I did similar but not as bad, my friend and I took the horses out on the road at night and her mom was livid", "NTA\n\nNope, what he did was extremely reckless and dangerous, not just him, but to Mark and other drivers. Not an overreaction at all", "NTA\n\nI remember a similar story on reddit. But the kids were not as lucky and the bf got injured badly. It wasn't sure he was ever going to play (football?) again. I might remember it wrong but it could be an idea to share some of these stories with your son so he understands why you were so upset with him.", "NTA Dad. He should know the gravity of the situation he put himself, his friend, and you into. Show him some gruesome aftermath photos of motorcycle crashes to get your point across, and make sure he really understands. Worst case scenario isn't even your son dying. Imagine if he killed someone else.", "Please go and have a calm conversation and follow up. For sure as a parent I would yell at him too, so NTA. Make sure he knows you care more about his health than the bike", "Because a GOOD parent would try to reduce the impact of ANY mistake on their kid's further life.", "I think this also comes with the youthful mentality that they're immune and nothing wrong can happen to them. I know I thought like this at 16.\n\nStealing your motorcycle for a joyride deserves yelling. Accidents can happen but hopefully OP's son realizes that now"]}
