Yes, teenagers do stupid shit, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't be punished for them. He put his own, his boyfriend's, and other people's lives in danger. You going off at him was only natural, I can't imagine how scared and angry you must have been \n\nHave another (calmer) conversation with him tomorrow. Make sure he understands what he did was not ok and that it won't happen again. Good luck", "Your kid is lucky you didn't press charges for theft. I think yelling was in order.\n\nNTA", "NTA - No, you needed to make him cry. That was incredibly reckless.", "NTA it\u2019s not only irresponsible but EXTREMELY dangerous. Sometimes as a parent you do need to put your foot down.", "NTA. Having been in a motorcycle accident, I can assure you hard words hurt less than hard pavement.", "NTA. Not only did he endanger his bf and himself, he could have have killed someone else too!  On top of that multiple laws were broken and you might end up having to pay for his actions yourself. You 100% should have made his ass cry. \n\nI got arrested when I was 14 (long story but it was for trespassing and I was handcuffed and had to do a mugshot and everything.) ..In no way did the actual act of getting arrested teach me a damn thing lol but the fear I had for my mom did. The entire time I was thinking \u201cmy mom is gonna kill me, my mom is gonna kill me, my mom is gonna kill me.\u201d ..You did the right thing.", "NTA - With a caveat. Teo definitely did deserve a talking-to and the reality check; of course yelling isn\u2019t *ideal,* neither is keeping the talk going for longer than necessary, but I understand that it came from a place of you being afraid for his safety. I think the reaction you had was very understandable given the circumstances.\n\nI think after you\u2019ve had time to cool down, you\u2019ll want to sit down with Teo and explain *why* you reacted the way you did. If you did feel you may have been too harsh, you can apologize for that. We can be right in our sentiment but still wrong in our delivery. Make it clear that getting that call was extremely scary for you and you only want him to be safe, that you want to be able to trust that he\u2019s capable of making good decisions, that you believe over time he can earn that trust back.", "NTA. Your son stole your bike. Yes, he was arrested, but that's a consequence of his own actions. You are right that he could've been killed or seriously injured, or he could've killed or seriously injured someone else.", "NTA. You're his parent not best friend. You did nothing wrong going off on him.", "Your wife is a *very* soft touch if a few tears made her forget the thieving, reckless driving, street racing, child endangerment, and potential loss of college scholarship. Teo needed to hear *everything* you said because he came within an inch of ruining his life, killing someone, and bankrupting you. NTA", "NTA and your wife is too soft", "NTA at all. \n\nI'd even make him repay you (part of) the fine. In installments if needs be.", "NTA\n\nYour kid could have killed himself and others. He isn't licensed, wasn't insured and stole from you, he knew he was in the wrong and if he wasn't ready to cry at the police station after her got picked up, he clearly hadn't been through enough that night.\n\nOn a related note, if you aren't using it and aren't going to now, get rid of it, that way you have removed  temptation and it is clear to your son that he isn't ever going to be given it.", "NTA. What were you supposed to do, give him a pat on the back and a cookie?  Make him earn every penny to pay the fines and maybe no recreational driving until all is paid.", "NTA.  Yelling at him for doing something incredibly unsafe is appropriate in the moment.  It would be better if today you had a calmer discussion about why this was a terrible idea, but don\u2019t baby him.  You\u2019re not correcting a child, you\u2019re correcting a young man.  I guess you already know that you need to secure your bike keys.", "NTA! I'm normally a person who advises against yelling at a child when angry, but in this case, you were absolutely justified! Hopefully, Teo's crying indicates he realizes how serious his stupid actions were! I don't even CARE about the BF's scholorship. They both could have been seriously injured or killed. Worse, they could have injured or killed an innocent bystander.\n\nDO NOT allow your wife to minimize the severity of him doing this!!! Do not pay his fines. Make him pay for them himself. If that means he needs to get a job to pay his fines, so be it.", "NTA. Teo is suffering the consequences of his actions. Fortunately those consequences are just you chewing him out and whatever legal repercussions are coming. Much better than being a long stain on the highway. \n\nI knew someone that was shot and killed during a street racing incident. It's not a safe thing to do and people compound it with extra stupid actions. Secure your keys and/or sell your bike, because Teo has definitely shown that he's capable of poor decisions.", "NTA - your son was totally irresponsible and could have killed both himself and his boyfriend.  Your wife is being too soft, would she prefer planning a funeral for her son and losing everything when being sued by the boyfriends parents.", "As long as you follow up with the more heartfelt concerned conversation about how it would kill you and his mother if you lost him and you yourself cry to drive home the importance of what you\u2019re saying and make it more about love than control you will not be the AH.  But today there needs to be the calmer heartfelt truth conversation that talks about your reasons that are personal to you and your wife.  How it would affect you if you lost him.  How it hurts you that he broke your trust.  How hurt you are.  Show that it\u2019s not just about being mad.  It\u2019s about being scared yourself and being hurt and not understanding why he did it.  It\u2019s about feeling like a failure of a parent.  Etc", "NTA\n\nBut why would you apologize to mark's parents? HE did this as much as your son did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut scolding him is not going to help. Get him a good lawyer instead.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Right now I'm NTA because Teo did something incredibly stupid and reckless, but talking-to's have a ceiling of effectiveness; afterwards, it's just cruel.", "NTA. This needed a good yelling so he knows you are serious. I hope that wasn\u2019t the only punishment and you now lock up keys since you know he sneaks out and is a thief.", "NTA\nHe endangered himself and his boyfriend, as well stole your property.", "Nta. He could've been killed. Lock up that motorcycle with a padlock and chains if you plan to keep it.", "NTA, yes he startet to cry, maybe because he understood what he risked, maybe not. But try to talk to him, he is old enough to see and understand his mistakes.", "I\u2019m firmly in the gentle parenting/talk to your kids camp, but my one exception is when the consequence of not getting the message across might be death. Kid likes to wrench free and run into traffic? Yelling. Kid steals your motorcycle he doesn\u2019t know how to ride and decides to fucking race it? Yelling. Better for the kid to bitch about you in therapy later. At least he\u2019ll be alive to do it. \n\nNTA.", "Nta - my brother's 20 year old friend just died street racing on a motorcycle. He hit a car that was turning left and ended up killing a 15 year old girl in the car. It's such a shame and pointless waste of life.", "NTA but you should probably have another chat with him when you\u2019re both calm about how frightening it is for you and your wife to get a call like that. \n\nTell him you responded so strongly because you love him so much and would never recover from losing him. \n\nThen get the fuck rid of the death machine in your shed.", "Absolutely  NTA your son and mark could have been killed or caused an accident and killed some one else. He deserved that talking too honestly", "NTA better he cry now while alive and realize the consequences of his actions then y\u2019all crying over a casket. Also try to talk to him again when you\u2019ve calm down. The message will go along better with a clearer head too. And if he wants to ride a motorcycle so bad he has to learn safety about it and also get his license.", "Kid is lucky he and his bf aren't being scraped off the ground. I'd be making him watch some horrific as videos about bike crashes + yelling + grounded til adulthood if he isn't in juvie over any charges the DA goes forward with.\n\nNTA", "im not a cop or a lawyer but im pretty sure you can't charge your own minor child that YOU are responsible for for theft? what in your brain makes you think the police wouldn't look at the father as soon as \"i want to press charges on my son\" and say \"you mean when you failed to watch the child you're responsible for, failed to properly lock away your bike and hide the keys and failed to even notice it being taken off your property? yeah we don't think he is who we'll charge\"  \n\n\n  \nwhat a wild fucking thought, charging your minor child with theft lmaooooo", "Why should he get him a lawyer? The kid STOLE HIS MOTORCYCLE! Teo needs to own up to what he did and pay the consequences!", "Considering what he\u2019s in trouble for, getting yelled all the way home is very light. He\u2019s facing CHARGES and because he\u2019s a minor, his parents are gonna be responsible for the fines. He could\u2019ve literally died, and took his boyfriend with him along the way. Kids lucky that\u2019s not my momma, she would\u2019ve told them to arrest me\ud83d\ude2d", "/u/Salt-Leopard8323, what specifically did you do that made your wife think that you went overboard?", "My son is bipolar...which means as a teen it was a rough ride. When he destroyed a good portion of things in my home...the police absolutely tried to get me to press charges as the damages were extensive. So yeah, he can press charges.", "If it was just yelling, then totally NTA, but the post is written a little vaguely that it makes me worry that something is being left out.", "It\u2019s not written vaguely at all. He yelled unto they got home, and Teo cried because of it. The wife is being soft. He wasn\u2019t crying when he stole the bike, so don\u2019t cry now."]}
