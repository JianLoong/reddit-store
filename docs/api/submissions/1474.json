He said he has nothing to say. \n\nI pay all the bills including the high speed internet he uses since he works from home.

Who\u2019s name is on the lease?", "Of course you're not the asshole. He is. WTF? He wasn't even going to tell you he's moving out? And you've been paying all the bills? Tell him he has 24 hours to pack his stuff and get the hell out. Where he goes is his problem, and he should have thought of that before treating his gf of 12 years like crap. If he doesn't go, pack his stuff for him and set it on the lawn. Then change the locks.", "Um...sorry...yeah you are. Well...both of you are. He absolutely is, but if he paid rent you can't kick him out. (At least not where I live.) I sympathize with you, but yeah...you probably don't have standing to make him go.\n\nDon't need to share anything with him though (bed, internet password, etc.).", "NTA. You would be well within your rights to make him leave on your schedule, not his. Also, change the wifi password.", "I don\u2019t know what the law is where you live but in many states you can\u2019t kick him out. Even if he wasn\u2019t in the lease he is still a tenant because he\u2019s been living there. \n\n\nI understand why you\u2019re upset but YTA based on most laws. Check your state. I would completely understand if you want to sleep on the couch.", "NTA \u2014 As others have said, you may not be able to get him to leave, legally, but you certainly have the right to tell him to sleep on the couch, or the floor, or anywhere but your bed.\n\nYou have every right to be furious.  He has the right to break up, but he should have told you, and he shouldn\u2019t be mooching off the food and internet etc. that you pay for.  Change the wifi password.\n\nETA:  I forgot to mention that you should tell him that he has to buy his own food and that if he wants to use the internet, he has to pay for the month.", "It's understandable that you want him gone yesterday, but it's not legal or just. He's a turd that's going to float for a few weeks.", "If he has paid rent for the month, you may not be able to kick him out. If he's on the lease, he may have legal access to the property until the end of said lease. You don't have to let him sleep with you, eat your food, use your wifi, or anything else you've paid for. He should have at least told you, but nobody is obligated to stay in a relationship if they don't want to. NAH", "That\u2019s really low to break up with you after he\u2019s signed a lease, only admitting to it after you call him on it - and then ask to stay in the same house.\n\nHe\u2019s either in or out. Sounds like he needs to get out-out.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThat's a really terrible way to find out that your fianc\u00e9's breaking up with you.   Can you afford to keep paying for the place you're renting now?  Is he still on that rental agreement?", "NTA \n\nBut check the laws where you live first. \n\nPlease see a lawyer asap. Depending on where you live, it could be considered a common-law marriage and you could be eligible for support.\n\nEdit: Try Relationship Advice sub. Breakups not allowed here.", "NTA. Like others have said legally he can\u2019t be pushed out but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to stay. Can you stay with a friend or air bnb for a few weeks? Just be sure to shut down any joint accounts before he leaves. Then be glad you found out who he is before you married him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your hopefully now ex just doesn't talk with you.\n\nStop the him from using that high speed Internet. Stop him from sleeping in the bed. Get a freeking lock on the fridge. Since you paid for all of them, he has zero right to use them.", "NTA \n\nFirst, cut off his access to stuff that you pay, as many as possible ( wifi is easy, others are difficult).\n\nSecond, take a decision about your living situation- are you comfortable with living alone in the same place (affordability-wise)? If yes, ask him to crash on the couch or something separate from you until he moves out.", "NTA but don\u2019t be an asshole to yourself and try to kick him out as depending on how your housing is set up, that could get you in trouble. If it\u2019s an option, I\u2019d leverage the fact that you pay all the bills and simply turn off the internet/take your modem with you when you go to work. Likewise, even if you pay all the rent, is his name on the lease?", "That's a great way to get yourself in legal trouble. Understand the emotion behind it, but legally unsound.", "It's a new month and a new lease so he doesn't need to pay rent. Probably should have put that in! Sorry. I'd have to change the password....", "They would not be well within their rights. If he pays rent or is on the lease, they legally have to let him stay until the end of the month.", "Lease ends next week and I already took him off it. We live in a one bedroom so there isn't much space left tbh. I know he isn't obligated to stay in the relationship especially since we've been having trouble but a heads up would have been nice that's all!", "I assumed that since OP was paying full rent up until a few months ago, or at least that's what \"I pay all the bills...we started splitting rent this year\" entailed, my comment about being within their rights was sound. But you would be right if the OP didn't explain the situation well enough.", "Yeah, it wasn't cool. I'd tell him he has to be out at the end of the lease, then. If he insists he has no place to go, come up with a per diem amount he has to pay that's advantageous to you.", "Even if they aren\u2019t paying rent, in most states it\u2019s illegal to kick someone out without 30 days notice."]}
