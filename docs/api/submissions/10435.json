You can either 1) respond in kind, which almost always escalates the situation, or 2) diffuse the situation by making a joke, changing the topic, ignoring it, etc. And then later, at the appropriate time (not in front of everyone), you can politely assert your displeasure at his inappropriate comment and request that he refrain from doing so in the future because it hurt and embarrassed both you and your son.\n\nAppealing to the AH's emotions and sensibilities tends to be way more effective than being an AH back.", "Our son is actually 12 now.
