My son is 10 years old. Backstory, years ago on a drunken night, I got my (ex) gf pregnant. Abortion was not an option because here it was (and still is) against the law. She gave birth and told me she wasn't ready to be a mom. So she left me and our son. Being a young father in my early 20s was difficult but thankfully I got by.\n\nI am not a religious person myself, but after befriending this one kid at school, my son has been going to church since he was 7 and involved in a lot of charity works, which I think is important to instill kindness and goodness in him until he gets older and decides what's best for himself. He identifies as Christian.\n\nLast year, my son's mother suddenly contacted me again. She's now married and has 3 children of her own. She said she was sorry and wanted to reconnect. I've always been honest and open with my son about why his mother left. But I also tell him that if one day she wants to reconnect and apologize, he shouldn't hold any grudge against her. People make mistakes. But I will support him no matter what he decides.\n\nNow twice a month, he would take the train to a neighbouring city to spend the weekend with his mother and her husband and their kids, who love him so much. We took up where we left off and decided to unofficialy co-parent him \n\nYesterday though, he told me that he didn't really feel like spending the weekend with them anymore. When I asked him why, he told me that they were teasing him for being a Christian. His mother has even told him many times that God does not exist and that being religious means you've been brainwashed to be narrow-minded and stuck in outdated teachings. I could see that it offended him deeply. \n\nI rang his mother up and told her everything, instead of saying sorry she started accusing me of brainwashing my son to believe in such nonsense as religion, God, etc. I told her she has no right to criticize something so personal to him. He is who he is, take it or leave it. She said since we are now co-parenting him, she is only going to teach him to see things from different perspectives as to broaden his mind and worldview. I told her no. And if she doesn't stop, he won't be spending time with them ever again. She started crying and calling me a horrible person for taking away her right to mother him.

If he declines and doesn't want to continue his relationship with her, that would be up to him. It sounds like she was very toxic and not open minded at all about her sons own belief. It's okay to not agree with your child's' beliefs. However, it's not okay to belittle and tease them if you don't agree with their beliefs. It sounds like you're being supportive, not an AH.", "NTA\nYou haven\u2019t pushed him into a specific way of thinking. He made his own choice and if it gives him peace of mind then allow it.

I was involved in scouts at the synagogue (it was not a religious affiliation, it was a use of the space, but we did Jewish things sometimes if we wanted to). But this is EXACTLY what I needed. I strayed from the path of G-d for many years, but in college, i did more research and realized that science supported many of the miracles in the Torah, they just called them miracles because they didn\u2019t understand science yet, and I honestly believe science is a miracle, so they were still miracles in my eyes. Your kid may stray from the path, but whatever their decision is, it is the path that G-d chose for them. I am glad there are parents out there still that are like my parents.

I know because I've been in this situation, but I can tell the difference between someone asking me a sincere question I can answer like \"Why did you come to work with ashes on your forehead today? What's that medal you're wearing signify?\" And someone with an obstinate set of opinions trying to 'trap' me into saying something that they can get mad over or drag through the mud \"why do you believe that stuff, anyway?' 'Didn't you know the REAL origin of this holiday?' etc. \n\nI would also add that pushing his beliefs on them isn't something I see happening here either. First off because \"pushing beliefs\" is interpreted very wildly (I interpret it as like, too much overt open evangelization, but some people interpret it as \"you wore a shirt/necklace with a cross to the party yesterday\" and I don't know how to respond to that) but also OP's kid is 10 and he's excited about God right now, you can't expect a 10 year old to shut up about his interests 100% and apart from politely explaining to him why you won't be attending church with him (which he'd understand since OP doesn't) there's no need to engage with anything else he's saying. If OP's kid was super into the Tooth Fairy right now and believed she was real you wouldn't think it was okay to butt heads with him until he was miserable about it. If you don't believe something is real, fine, but why be nasty to a child over it?", "It\u2019s about mutual respect big dog. It\u2019s an important value. Once you grow up, you\u2019ll understand. Or maybe you won\u2019t and you\u2019ll suck your whole life.", "I mean there's nothing wrong with encouraging him to read books. But mocking or belittling his belief is where she crosses the line. Maybe you can try to have another conversation with her and discuss how that makes your son feel. Approach this from the side of her wording and how it hurts him, rather than her intention.  Like you said she could give your son ways to broaden his horizon without forcing her own opinions on him. Your son seems to be happy to see them overall, so I would try to see if it's possible to salvage the relationship.\n\nEdit: side note, but you're going to want to keep an eye on what your son learns at sunday school too. He's only 7, and some sunday schools do some serious brainwashing. One of my kid's friends was told by her sunday school teacher that her father (who's atheist) is evil and would go to hell and so would her lesbian aunt. She was 6 at the time. She cried about it for weeks."]}
