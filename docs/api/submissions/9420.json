My son on the other hand identifies as Christian and I support him no matter what. Regarding religious views, I don't care what he believes or does not believe in as long as he's happy. My only problem with his mother is not that she wants to teach him to see things from different perspectives (non religious ways), but how she does it by making fun of him and his faith.\n\n.\n\nI am (30 M) a single parent. My son is 10 years old. Backstory, years ago on a drunken night, I got my (ex) gf pregnant. Abortion was not an option because here it was (and still is) against the law. She gave birth and told me she wasn't ready to be a mom. So she left me and our son. Being a young father in my early 20s was difficult but thankfully I got by.\n\nI am not a religious person myself, but after befriending this one kid at school, my son has been going to church since he was 7 and involved in a lot of charity works, which I think is important to instill kindness and goodness in him until he gets older and decides what's best for himself. He identifies as Christian.\n\nLast year, my son's mother suddenly contacted me again. She's now married and has 3 children of her own. She said she was sorry and wanted to reconnect. I've always been honest and open with my son about why his mother left. But I also tell him that if one day she wants to reconnect and apologize, he shouldn't hold any grudge against her. People make mistakes. But I will support him no matter what he decides.\n\nNow twice a month, he would take the train to a neighbouring city to spend the weekend with his mother and her husband and their kids, who love him so much. We took up where we left off and decided to unofficialy co-parent him \n\nYesterday though, he told me that he didn't really feel like spending the weekend with them anymore. When I asked him why, he told me that they were teasing him for being a Christian. His mother has even told him many times that God does not exist and that being religious means you've been brainwashed to be narrow-minded and stuck in outdated teachings. I could see that it offended him deeply. \n\nI rang his mother up and told her everything, instead of saying sorry she started accusing me of brainwashing my son to believe in such nonsense as religion, God, etc. I told her she has no right to criticize something so personal to him. He is who he is, take it or leave it. She said since we are now co-parenting him, she is only going to teach him to see things from different perspectives as to broaden his mind and worldview. I told her no. And if she doesn't stop, he won't be spending time with them ever again. She started crying and calling me a horrible person for taking away her right to mother him.

I'm not saying you should sue. But you are likely to need to be able to gather evidence that your child -not you- is the one driving this religious conversion, and a lawyer can help you determine how to do this in a way that will satisfy a court.", "NTA\n\nThe religion thing is another issue. What the mother of your kid is doing is abuse. It's one thing to make the kid ask questions to \"test his faith\" and it's one thing to blatantly be a butthole towards your kid for his religious beliefs. Her kids might have also been taught growing up to ridicule other people's beliefs, making them think that the religious ones are idiots, thus the teasing.\n\nWould I want to go somewhere where I'll most likely be uncomfortable for the rest of my stay? Of course not.", "NTA\n\nRidiculing him is not ok.\n\nTelling them that they do not believe is ok. Questioning his beliefs is ok.", "NTA, She is not trying to teach him, she is the one trying to control how he thinks by belittling him and allowing her family to do so.\n\nSo long as your son does not want to see them then you are not wrong.", "Oh boy.\n\nINFO: did you ask your son if he was okay with not being around her anymore?", "NTA. It sounds like you're letting him choose his own path and religion. You can ask him how he feels about his mothers proposal of learning about other religions and if he's open to that. That's fine. If he declines and doesn't want to continue his relationship with her, that would be up to him. It sounds like she was very toxic and not open minded at all about her sons own belief. It's okay to not agree with your child's' beliefs. However, it's not okay to belittle and tease them if you don't agree with their beliefs. It sounds like you're being supportive, not an AH.", "NTA\nYou haven\u2019t pushed him into a specific way of thinking. He made his own choice and if it gives him peace of mind then allow it. Ridiculing a child especially after not having contact with the child for 10 years is insane to me. Amazing that she wanted to reconnect and now belittles him. Feel\nBad for the guy. Just give him positive affirmations of believing in himself and his ideals and continue not to point him into being religious or not.", "NTA. Im jewish. My parents raised me jewish and when we went to synagogue i was uninterested in participating so I usually brought a book. My parents were ok with this. They sat me down in middle school and said i don\u2019t have to believe what they believe and that I should find my own path. I was involved in scouts at the synagogue (it was not a religious affiliation, it was a use of the space, but we did Jewish things sometimes if we wanted to). But this is EXACTLY what I needed. I strayed from the path of G-d for many years, but in college, i did more research and realized that science supported many of the miracles in the Torah, they just called them miracles because they didn\u2019t understand science yet, and I honestly believe science is a miracle, so they were still miracles in my eyes. Your kid may stray from the path, but whatever their decision is, it is the path that G-d chose for them. I am glad there are parents out there still that are like my parents. They weren\u2019t perfect, but this was something that 100% they did right.", "NTA.  She wants the right to parent him now, and she's choosing something important to him as her battleground.  Now, he doesn't want to visit.  Scrubs have consequences, and this is hers.", "It would have been ok if she tried to explain other perspectives or tried to talk to him politely, but she started teasing him for his beliefs which is not at all a mature thing to do especially being a parent. OP is NTA. \nAs for co-parenting, the mother has no idea how the kid was raised, she does not have the right to tell the kid otherwise for his beliefs, moreover, she accused OP of brainwashing the child, which is ironic as she\u2019s trying to manipulate the child by teasing him\u2026 it seems that OP isn\u2019t religious himself\u2026", "NTA for making the threat. Let her take you to court, and watch what happens, that might be the best thing for all three of you. Sometimes it is appropriate to make a threat that goes a bit further than you can quite carry out, if you'll still get most of what you need.\n\nWhatever country you're in, the freedom of religion is a basic human right. You are the parent who made the decision about your son's religion, and your son has a right to his own input as well. Being told no is one thing, being insulted quite another.", "NTA. Your son got to the age of 10 without any involvement from his mother by her choice. He grew up believing in your faith (unopposed) and that is fine. Now she wants to change his beliefs by ridiculing him. It is disruptive. She doesn\u2019t seem to acknowledge that she is new in his life. To me this isn\u2019t about religion but wanting to change his views to be less like yours and more like hers. Is she likely to go to court for mandated access? I would leave it up to your son to decide what he wants to do.", "This is a sticky situation.  But considering it is your son making the decision I think you\u2019re NTA here.  She forfeited her position to influence his beliefs when she abandoned him.  She is really in no position to criticize his choices regarding religion now, and if her criticism is making him uncomfortable enough that he doesn\u2019t want to spend time with her, she has no one to blame for that but herself.", "NTA\n\nI don't personally believe in any religion either so this is a hard one for me because I mostly agree with her. But if it's upsetting him to the point that he doesn't want to visit, then she needs to shut her mouth if she wants to have a relationship with him.", "NTA - people who aren\u2019t into religion shouldn\u2019t mock those who are.", "NTA-She\u2019s trying to brainwash him, the very thing she\u2019s accusing religion of doing.", "unpopular opinion but YTA.  You decided to coparent now. She is allowed to teach him cognitive thinking skills and skepticism. If that leads to him deciding not to be Christian than so what? We can guide and teach our kids but inevitably they will form their own opinions on religion. You don\u2019t get to dictate the time she spends with him anymore than she gets to dictate yours.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like the kid found his way to christianity on his own and is perfectly happy with it. Encouraging him to think critically about christianity or other religions is one thing, but bullying him about what he believes to the point that he doesn\u2019t want to participate in whats sounds like it used to be a fun time for him is way too far. My step dad was a methodist minister and I\u2019m not religious at all, but I was never forced to go to church unless they were doing a fundraiser and having an extra person meant helping more people.

He's much happier and always excited to see his siblings. He also likes his mother and her husband who treats him kind. His only problem with her is she always tries to encourage him to read more books and open his mind because according to her religions are just a bunch of narrow-minded people who  believes in something blindly and aggressively.\n\nI don't care what my son believes or does not believe in as long as he's happy.
