Before people tell me that we should sit down and talk. Or do therapy. Those options have been exhausted and are no longer viable. \n\nMe and my ex wife Theresa (38F) do not have a good relationship. We started dating at 16 and then had Bella at 21. At first everything was awesome. But then my wife started hanging out with a group of women. Just not very good people. I refused to hangout with them. My wife started drinking heavily with this group and going out at night leaving me with our daughter. I didn\u2019t like how she was keeping up our home either as I worked full time and she didn\u2019t. The final straw was when I was forced to come along bar hopping. Theresa got embarrassingly drunk. Then started calling me a loser in front of everyone. This was not the first time she had publicly disrespected me. She had a habit of trying to show off to her friend by belittling me. I filed for divorce the next weekend. \n\nThe original custody agreement was 50/50. Which then changed because I asked for a DNA test on Bella. I had heard rumors and wanted to confirm. My ex blew up and refused to allow a DNA test to be done. Solidifying what I expected. My ex went back and got pretty much full custody because I refused to pay child support without a DNA test. This has been the arrangement for 5 years. I see Bella a few times a month. \n\nI do what I can but I don\u2019t have custody so it\u2019s difficult. I am engaged to one of my best friends Chrissy (33F). We\u2019ve known each other since college. Bella hates her for no reason. Chrissy wasn\u2019t even involved in my life once i got married. Bella for some reason thinks she is terrible. Chrissy has been nothing but nice to Bella. Recently someone showed me Bella\u2019s social media where she blasted us. Saying how she had a deadbeat dad (not true as I paid for her and her mom for 7 years. And still give her money whenever I see her.). And called chrissy a slut in the same post. \n\nI was planning my invites for our wedding and I did not invite Bella. She doesn\u2019t care for us. She called Chrissy a slut. And shamed me on social media lying for attention. I also don\u2019t want drama at my wedding. It should be a fun time. Not another event for Bella to hijack. My ex wife found out about the wedding and asked what Bella\u2019s role would be. I told her she didn\u2019t have one because she isn\u2019t invited. I called Bella and gave her my reasoning. As well as telling her that her post on social media played a factor so she should be more careful what lies she wants to put out there. She tried to apologize and say she would behave at the wedding. I told her that I knew she didn\u2019t like Chrissy, or me that much. So why would she expect an invite. She called me an AH and we haven\u2019t spoken since.

If you took the test today and she is naturally yours how would you make up all that time of neglect?

To be fair I\u2019m sure her mother had some influence but from what you\u2019ve given us here it doesn\u2019t seem you have been father of the century either. As to your now fianc\u00e9, we\u2019ll the troubled girl doesn\u2019t like her, no shock there. Even if she is as perfect as you paint & possibly has her mom in her ear over it, she still represents a new life that your daughter has frustrated emotions over.

I'm sure that it somehow justified you not to pay child support, or even having regular contact, at least in your mind right? \n\nJesus. Are you seriously wondering how she got this way? Your daughter was raised thinking that she was your daughter only to be shut out and neglected. Bad parents raise bad people and both you and your ex are to blame for the way she acts towards you now. You can't just wash your hands of her and then get surprised-Pikachu-face when she calls you out.", "YTA of course. The right thing to do would be to have the DNA test.

She's only 16, she might have been disrespectful but obviously she's very traumatic. Her mother is a trauma on her on its own... But you're basicly out of the picture man, your obivously not seeing her as you real daughter, she has right to be mad at you. And since she's with her mother all the time she's filled with her mother's toughts, it's very normal for her to believe her mother at age 16.\n\nYou're not making a good job as a father. If dna is really important you should've ask for it in the court. You and her mother both gave her huge traumas. I feel sorry for the kid.

Also I suspect you really do know she's your kid, and you understand that once the DNA test demonstrated that, you wouldn't have a leg to stand on because you'd be exposed as an obvious deadbeat. \n\nYou rejected her. You believe she's not your daughter because your ex refused a DNA test and you didn't even do the basics to get a real answer.

Why should Bella have any positive attitude about Chrissy?", "Its though... you re not TA for wanting a stress drama free wedding, and i feel like she would for sure make a scene if she doesnt like your fiance... but shes a kid that mostly knows only what her mom tells her, and might be \"brainwashed\" by her mom...\n\nEdit: Nvm you clearly dont care if she is or isnt your daughter even, you didnt care enough to get a DNA test to be 100% sure cuz it was a \"cheaper\" than going to court! You lived with this girl 11 years and then just abandoned her... YTA.", "YTA,\n\nYou should have talked to her before you made this decision.  Communication is everything, easier said than done, but difficult conversations need to happen, especially with your children. She is young still and needs to be called out and have consequences, but not having her relationship effectively destroyed by her Dad. This will be the end of your relationship for a very long time, if not forever.\n\nYou should have talked to her and drawn some boundaries and said the consequences are being uninvited from the wedding.  Not how you did it. If you can, try and fix it.", "Yta\nYou refused to pay for child support after suspecting from a rumour that you weren't your daughter's bio dad. Yet you claim you're still present in her life when you only see her occasionally and just gives her some money when you see her. To me, that's not being a present dad. So I wouldn't say she lied about that.\nThe way your daughter acted was not great either. She shouldn't have insulted your new gf. \nYou're not obligated to invite her at your wedding. But I think yta here for rejecting the whole blame on your daughter for the bad relationship you have. You didn't seem to want to have a huge place in her life for five years, and it seems easy to reject the blame on her now.", "She is 16, and of course, she is ragging on you on social media. The interesting twist here is that you deserve all the vitriol. You gave up on your daughter, and just the fact that you put that in quotes on the title makes you TA.

And yes, if you aren't paying to help support Bella now, that makes you a deadbeat dad. I get why you wouldn't want to give the money to the ex, but you can set up a monthly stipend to Bella. \n\nEither you're a father or you're not.

That being said, this will tank whatever relationship you have with Bella.

Maybe this will be unpopular but while I understand what your daughter has said has hurt you (and of course you should only invite who you want to your wedding) this girl has also felt immense hurt.

However, given the circumstances and her likely not being your child, I get it. Either way, Bella needs some therapy or at least a conclusion on paternity. That would help you both move on.", "Yta.  Bella saw you as her dad", "If your ex would rather no longer accept child support the rest of the child's life than have a DNA test, then she's not your daughter.

The one thing I\u2019ll say though is that Bella is most likely being fed lies by your ex and probably given a distorted view of things.", "NTA.\n\nGet that paternity test if possible now.

Weddings are for people who want to celebrate the happy couple and it sounds like your daughter doesn't.\n\nThat said, this will likely be the nail in the coffin of any relationship between the two. \n\nI do have a lot of sympathy for the girl whose dad basically walked out after over a decade because he wasn't certain she was his. Her biology is out of her control and it's shitty to punish her for something her mother may have done. Especially given that it sounds as though your ex may have struggled with addiction prior to the divorce which your daughter likely had to bear the brunt of.\n\nIt's also pretty common for kids to struggle to accept step-parents. I'm not at all condoning Bella's behaviour especially given that you mentioned therapy but I'm not sure how much grace you actually gave her in coming to terms with everything. \n\nSo I'd suspect you were probably a shittier dad than you realize or are willing to admit and this is the inevitable outcome.", "NTA. Hurt people, hurt people, and I'd wager that your daughter is hurting from how your ex is.

Before people tell me that we should sit down and talk. Or do therapy. Those options have been exhausted and are no longer viable. \n\nMe and my ex wife Theresa (38F) do not have a good relationship. We started dating at 16 and then had Bella at 21. At first everything was awesome. But then my wife started hanging out with a group of women. Just not very good people. I refused to hangout with them. My wife started drinking heavily with this group and going out at night leaving me with our daughter. I didn\u2019t like how she was keeping up our home either as I worked full time and she didn\u2019t. The final straw was when I was forced to come along bar hopping. Theresa got embarrassingly drunk. Then started calling me a loser in front of everyone. This was not the first time she had publicly disrespected me. She had a habit of trying to show off to her friend by belittling me. I filed for divorce the next weekend. \n\nThe original custody agreement was 50/50. Which then changed because I asked for a DNA test on Bella. I had heard rumors and wanted to confirm. My ex blew up and refused to allow a DNA test to be done. Solidifying what I expected. My ex went back and got pretty much full custody because I refused to pay child support without a DNA test. This has been the arrangement for 5 years. I see Bella a few times a month. \n\nI do what I can but I don\u2019t have custody so it\u2019s difficult. I am engaged to one of my best friends Chrissy (33F). We\u2019ve known each other since college. Bella hates her for no reason. Chrissy wasn\u2019t even involved in my life once i got married. Bella for some reason thinks she is terrible. Chrissy has been nothing but nice to Bella. Recently someone showed me Bella\u2019s social media where she blasted us. Saying how she had a deadbeat dad (not true as I paid for her and her mom for 7 years. And still give her money whenever I see her.). And called chrissy a slut in the same post. \n\nI was planning my invites for our wedding and I did not invite Bella. She doesn\u2019t care for us. She called Chrissy a slut. And shamed me on social media lying for attention. I also don\u2019t want drama at my wedding. It should be a fun time. Not another event for Bella to hijack. My ex wife found out about the wedding and asked what Bella\u2019s role would be. I told her she didn\u2019t have one because she isn\u2019t invited. I called Bella and gave her my reasoning. As well as telling her that her post on social media played a factor so she should be more careful what lies she wants to put out there. She tried to apologize and say she would behave at the wedding. I told her that I knew she didn\u2019t like Chrissy, or me that much. So why would she expect an invite. She called me an AH and we haven\u2019t spoken since. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If it had come back negative then you would be in the same boat as you are now, except you would have a convincing reason to give Bella for being a \"deadbeat dad.\" \n\nI guess I am just wondering why you seem to care but also not care for Bella - you refused to support her without a DNA test but you have her every month, you plan to marry Chrissy regardless of what Bella thinks of her but you also want Bella to like her. What do you really want your relationship with Bella to look like?", "YTA\n\nWhat really gets me here is that you dont even know that she isnt yours.

Divorce seems like it was the right move there. \n\nI will say though, 11 years is a long while to wait for a DNA test. I also kinda feel like throwing away a relationship with your \"daughter\" based on a strong suspicion is kinda shitty. If you are willing to challenge that, go all the way with it, you could probably get it ordered by the court. A lot of people would say that it doesn't matter, you're the one that raised her, does it matter who her bio father is? IMO yeah it does kinda matter, and I think that's something any individual in this situation has to decide for themselves, there's no wrong answer. It sucks for the kid for sure when you choose to break that relationship, but that's not your problem. However, if you're going to to blow this whole thing up, be sure and get a DNA test. \n\nGiven the question in a vacuum, yeah I'd say N T A for not wanting someone at your wedding that doesn't support your marriage and whom you've decided to break ties with.

What if you or her in the future do a DNA test and she is your bio daughter after all?!... will you be happy with yourself? Do you think sorry I didn't think you are, will be enough?

It feels like you made up your mind and acted accordingly based on pretty much nothing.\nEven if she suspected the child not being yours and that's why she refused the test, if she was sexually active with you and another man at the time of conception she can't know for sure either.", "He literally said in the post he stopped paying child support and had her live with her mom full time (instead of 50/50 custody). How is that not abandoning his daughter?", "True. I think I covered that in a non-specific way with the blanket statement \"among other issues\".", "BUT refused to actually do the work to have that paternity test ordered.", "Why would the mother refuse to do the test if Bella is his daughter? If the mother tried to go for child support, she couldn' refuse the test.

Though I suppose she's heard it second hand even from his own lips. His description of the events did not have him relinquish rights, just lose them because he refused to pay child support. He also sees her \"a few times\" a month, which I admit can be hard on everyone, unless he's just not trying. \n\nAs is often the case, I can only go with OP's description of the events and I try to not analyze too deeply on the \"hows\" and \"whys\" of things, just the question at hand. I sometimes offer a little life advise to not have this be a dead end, and perhaps I analyzed a little more than I should have here with only half of the story about why his daughter is being mean. \n\nNow, as has happened before, if he comments more and I find out that he's actually told her she's not his and treated her as just his ex-wife's illegitimate kid, then yeah that deeper analysis becomes important and I'll change my vote. He doesn't get a free pass if he's been an AH consistently before and is just now playing victim.", "You haven't been on your daughters team for years.", "Why should she be on your team", "I think that makes perfect sense", "Why should anyone be on your team?

Your actions make a low opinion pretty much the only option.\n\nTake accountability and stop punishing this kid cause you\u2019re mad at her mom.", "Why is it deranged for her to think that maybe you had an affair with someone who you met in college and reconnected with years later and just hid it from her?

Even if it\u2019s not true, that sounds like a really normal assumption to make as the ex.", "What\u2019s wrong with wanting a DNA test, paying support anyway, and visiting with the child a few times a month?", "For that being the actual question you really tried hard to let everyone know how much you dislike your ex.\nIf you wanted to ask \"AITA for not inviting someone that insulted me online\" you could have just asked that. You are gezzing the answrrs for the question you *actually* asked :)", "Even if she did cheat, he and Chrissy were apparently still having sex around the time of conception or else he would've figured it out a lot sooner, so it's still possibly his bio kid.\n\nIn my experience, it's not the true motive though. I have two of these in my family, but their children are 100% their bio children (one of them is a spitting image of his father). One of them abandoned two of his sons by two different mothers, conveniently when he moved onto the next woman.\n\nI feel like I've read a similar post before though, because I remember being confused at why an angry teen would beg to be part of a wedding, where they don't like the bride or groom. Even if she was upset about being excluded, teens are typically good at pretending to be flippant about these things and it's not like most weddings are exciting.", "That simply is not happening.

He doesn't actually want the results of the test.\n\nI mean, he could even file and have ordered that if Bella turns out not to be his daughter, his ex pay him back for the costs of the test!

It should only cost him if Bella is his biological daughter.", "He could have had one court ordered, which is a standard legal advice, to get a final answer once and for all. He chose not to. His ex isn\u2019t wrong for not paying for a paternity test without a court order, and it\u2019s not an immediate sign that she\u2019s lying about Bella\u2019s father.", "That doesn't really change anything at all here.

What she does know is that there was once 50/50 custody, and then, in the best possible version of events, just up and left her life for no apparent reason. She also called him a dead-beat, so she is presumably aware that the OP does not pay child support. And yeah, to be clear, if you abandon your kid because you're not paying child support, that counts as relinquishing your rights. That choice says far more that he doesn't feel she's really his child than any words would.

Where are you getting the impression that he pays?", "He's not paying child support.

You pretty much have only two years or less to challenge paternity once you've been legally assigned it or legally accepted it.\n\nA test done without the court's order would mean absolutely nothing. The court wouldn't take it as evidence of anything. The court would order another test if someone wanted the results entered into the court record or used as part of the case.
