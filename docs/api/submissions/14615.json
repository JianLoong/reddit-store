Before people tell me that we should sit down and talk. Or do therapy. Those options have been exhausted and are no longer viable. \n\nMe and my ex wife Theresa (38F) do not have a good relationship. We started dating at 16 and then had Bella at 21. At first everything was awesome. But then my wife started hanging out with a group of women. Just not very good people. I refused to hangout with them. My wife started drinking heavily with this group and going out at night leaving me with our daughter. I didn\u2019t like how she was keeping up our home either as I worked full time and she didn\u2019t. The final straw was when I was forced to come along bar hopping. Theresa got embarrassingly drunk. Then started calling me a loser in front of everyone. This was not the first time she had publicly disrespected me. She had a habit of trying to show off to her friend by belittling me. I filed for divorce the next weekend. \n\nThe original custody agreement was 50/50. Which then changed because I asked for a DNA test on Bella. I had heard rumors and wanted to confirm. My ex blew up and refused to allow a DNA test to be done. Solidifying what I expected. My ex went back and got pretty much full custody because I refused to pay child support without a DNA test. This has been the arrangement for 5 years. I see Bella a few times a month. \n\nI do what I can but I don\u2019t have custody so it\u2019s difficult. I am engaged to one of my best friends Chrissy (33F). We\u2019ve known each other since college. Bella hates her for no reason. Chrissy wasn\u2019t even involved in my life once i got married. Bella for some reason thinks she is terrible. Chrissy has been nothing but nice to Bella. Recently someone showed me Bella\u2019s social media where she blasted us. Saying how she had a deadbeat dad (not true as I paid for her and her mom for 7 years. And still give her money whenever I see her.). And called chrissy a slut in the same post. \n\nI was planning my invites for our wedding and I did not invite Bella. She doesn\u2019t care for us. She called Chrissy a slut. And shamed me on social media lying for attention. I also don\u2019t want drama at my wedding. It should be a fun time. Not another event for Bella to hijack. My ex wife found out about the wedding and asked what Bella\u2019s role would be. I told her she didn\u2019t have one because she isn\u2019t invited. I called Bella and gave her my reasoning. As well as telling her that her post on social media played a factor so she should be more careful what lies she wants to put out there. She tried to apologize and say she would behave at the wedding. I told her that I knew she didn\u2019t like Chrissy, or me that much. So why would she expect an invite. She called me an AH and we haven\u2019t spoken since.

To be fair I\u2019m sure her mother had some influence but from what you\u2019ve given us here it doesn\u2019t seem you have been father of the century either. As to your now fianc\u00e9, we\u2019ll the troubled girl doesn\u2019t like her, no shock there.

I'm sure that it somehow justified you not to pay child support, or even having regular contact, at least in your mind right? \n\nJesus. Are you seriously wondering how she got this way? Your daughter was raised thinking that she was your daughter only to be shut out and neglected. Bad parents raise bad people and both you and your ex are to blame for the way she acts towards you now.

She's only 16, she might have been disrespectful but obviously she's very traumatic. Her mother is a trauma on her on its own... But you're basicly out of the picture man, your obivously not seeing her as you real daughter, she has right to be mad at you. And since she's with her mother all the time she's filled with her mother's toughts, it's very normal for her to believe her mother at age 16.\n\nYou're not making a good job as a father.

Also I suspect you really do know she's your kid, and you understand that once the DNA test demonstrated that, you wouldn't have a leg to stand on because you'd be exposed as an obvious deadbeat. \n\nYou rejected her. You believe she's not your daughter because your ex refused a DNA test and you didn't even do the basics to get a real answer.

Why should Bella have any positive attitude about Chrissy?", "Its though... you re not TA for wanting a stress drama free wedding, and i feel like she would for sure make a scene if she doesnt like your fiance... but shes a kid that mostly knows only what her mom tells her, and might be \"brainwashed\" by her mom...\n\nEdit: Nvm you clearly dont care if she is or isnt your daughter even, you didnt care enough to get a DNA test to be 100% sure cuz it was a \"cheaper\" than going to court! You lived with this girl 11 years and then just abandoned her... YTA.", "YTA,\n\nYou should have talked to her before you made this decision.  Communication is everything, easier said than done, but difficult conversations need to happen, especially with your children. She is young still and needs to be called out and have consequences, but not having her relationship effectively destroyed by her Dad. This will be the end of your relationship for a very long time, if not forever.\n\nYou should have talked to her and drawn some boundaries and said the consequences are being uninvited from the wedding.  Not how you did it. If you can, try and fix it.", "Yta\nYou refused to pay for child support after suspecting from a rumour that you weren't your daughter's bio dad. Yet you claim you're still present in her life when you only see her occasionally and just gives her some money when you see her. To me, that's not being a present dad. So I wouldn't say she lied about that.\nThe way your daughter acted was not great either. She shouldn't have insulted your new gf. \nYou're not obligated to invite her at your wedding. But I think yta here for rejecting the whole blame on your daughter for the bad relationship you have.

And yes, if you aren't paying to help support Bella now, that makes you a deadbeat dad. I get why you wouldn't want to give the money to the ex, but you can set up a monthly stipend to Bella. \n\nEither you're a father or you're not.

Before people tell me that we should sit down and talk. Or do therapy. Those options have been exhausted and are no longer viable. \n\nMe and my ex wife Theresa (38F) do not have a good relationship. We started dating at 16 and then had Bella at 21. At first everything was awesome. But then my wife started hanging out with a group of women. Just not very good people. I refused to hangout with them. My wife started drinking heavily with this group and going out at night leaving me with our daughter. I didn\u2019t like how she was keeping up our home either as I worked full time and she didn\u2019t. The final straw was when I was forced to come along bar hopping. Theresa got embarrassingly drunk. Then started calling me a loser in front of everyone. This was not the first time she had publicly disrespected me. She had a habit of trying to show off to her friend by belittling me. I filed for divorce the next weekend. \n\nThe original custody agreement was 50/50. Which then changed because I asked for a DNA test on Bella. I had heard rumors and wanted to confirm. My ex blew up and refused to allow a DNA test to be done. Solidifying what I expected. My ex went back and got pretty much full custody because I refused to pay child support without a DNA test. This has been the arrangement for 5 years. I see Bella a few times a month. \n\nI do what I can but I don\u2019t have custody so it\u2019s difficult. I am engaged to one of my best friends Chrissy (33F). We\u2019ve known each other since college. Bella hates her for no reason. Chrissy wasn\u2019t even involved in my life once i got married. Bella for some reason thinks she is terrible. Chrissy has been nothing but nice to Bella. Recently someone showed me Bella\u2019s social media where she blasted us. Saying how she had a deadbeat dad (not true as I paid for her and her mom for 7 years. And still give her money whenever I see her.). And called chrissy a slut in the same post. \n\nI was planning my invites for our wedding and I did not invite Bella. She doesn\u2019t care for us. She called Chrissy a slut. And shamed me on social media lying for attention. I also don\u2019t want drama at my wedding. It should be a fun time. Not another event for Bella to hijack. My ex wife found out about the wedding and asked what Bella\u2019s role would be. I told her she didn\u2019t have one because she isn\u2019t invited. I called Bella and gave her my reasoning. As well as telling her that her post on social media played a factor so she should be more careful what lies she wants to put out there. She tried to apologize and say she would behave at the wedding. I told her that I knew she didn\u2019t like Chrissy, or me that much. So why would she expect an invite. She called me an AH and we haven\u2019t spoken since. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If it had come back negative then you would be in the same boat as you are now, except you would have a convincing reason to give Bella for being a \"deadbeat dad.\" \n\nI guess I am just wondering why you seem to care but also not care for Bella - you refused to support her without a DNA test but you have her every month, you plan to marry Chrissy regardless of what Bella thinks of her but you also want Bella to like her. What do you really want your relationship with Bella to look like?", "YTA\n\nWhat really gets me here is that you dont even know that she isnt yours.

Divorce seems like it was the right move there. \n\nI will say though, 11 years is a long while to wait for a DNA test. I also kinda feel like throwing away a relationship with your \"daughter\" based on a strong suspicion is kinda shitty. If you are willing to challenge that, go all the way with it, you could probably get it ordered by the court. A lot of people would say that it doesn't matter, you're the one that raised her, does it matter who her bio father is? IMO yeah it does kinda matter, and I think that's something any individual in this situation has to decide for themselves, there's no wrong answer. It sucks for the kid for sure when you choose to break that relationship, but that's not your problem. However, if you're going to to blow this whole thing up, be sure and get a DNA test. \n\nGiven the question in a vacuum, yeah I'd say N T A for not wanting someone at your wedding that doesn't support your marriage and whom you've decided to break ties with.

What if you or her in the future do a DNA test and she is your bio daughter after all?!... will you be happy with yourself? Do you think sorry I didn't think you are, will be enough?

WHO CARES!?? that's not HER fault! You raised her since she was born, how could you not love her as your own child?

Two parents with a messy divorce and by the sounds of it, a not particularly great marriage prior to that.

Depending on how quickly dad rushed to Crissy's arms after the divorce there could indeed be some major resentment there. But also once this woman came into dad's life dad started to say \"she's not my child!\" and reject his daughter. Bella is a TEENAGER, being a teen is hard anyway and she's hurting.

We don't get a full picture. All we know is that he refuses to do a DNA test, even now. If you read the comments, he mentions he didn't want to pursue or get a DNA test on his own terms.

But he was with the woman all through the pregnancy and was there the day of her birth. He still held her against his chest while she slept for the first few months, just as he had done with his first daughter. \n\nHe told me that as the 2nd child started growing older it became more and more apparent that she shared no features with him, but looked suspiciously like a male friend of his girlfriend. A male friend that would hang out at his house with his girlfriend while he was at work.\n\nI asked him if he ever considered getting a DNA test to find out. He told me no, said it wouldn't have mattered and he couldn't handle it if it came back that he wasn't the dad.

She didn\u2019t want to and it doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out why.", "Lots of reasons. \n\nFor one, it's a waste of resources. The incidence of false paternity in society at large is incredibly low. It's more or less common depending on culture, but even the worst estimates don't put paternity fraud at more than 8%, and it's usually closer to 4-5%. That's among every couple having children together - the incidence of fraud for requested tests is higher because, well, there's a reason someone is doubting paternity. \n\nAlso, there's no ethical way to implement universal paternity testing. \n\nBy which I mean: imagine a situation in which the couple trusts each other and wants to waive the test. Do you just go ahead and make them do it anyway? That's a huge violation of the father's rights to his own genetic information and healthcare decisions, and the rights of the parents to the same over their infant. \n\nSo, ok, we allow parents to waive the test. But now you'll have situations where the father will want the test 'just to be sure' and the mother is angry at the accusation that she both cheated and is of poor enough moral character to pass another man's baby off as someone else's. A lot of women would rightfully consider this a relationship-ending lack of trust. \n\nLastly, who pays for the tests? The hospital? The parents? The government? Circle back to 'waste of resources,' there's no good reason to pay for tests that we have a pretty good reason to assume are 96-92% of the time going to come back 'yep, he's the father.'", "Did I miss something in the post?

Genuinely curious to what I missed.", "yeah I knew that from daughter being in quote marks in the title", "Why did he need ex's approval to get the test?

Hes still unsure but has still tried. But the daughter badmouthing him and lying isnt helping.", "He tried to get the test in a lot of places you can't test without both parents consenting, so what was he supposed to do?", "Unless the kid's not his, then he's by definition the step father. He was married to her mom but the child is hers+whoever she was cheating with.", "And if she is, he's TAH, if she's not, NTA. The fact that the mother refused a paternity test is pretty suspicious, but he also declined to compel one soo...", "The truth is the kid clearly doesn't matter to the OP.", "It really does though. She cheated and he's been paying for and raising this kid for years. Maybe she should get money from the sperm donor instead of this poor bastard.", "Nah. I have a 16 year old that isn\u2019t a prick.", "Legally she is his kid.", "Not to mention that the birth certificate has nothing to do with genetic \"ownership.\" It's two people who are agreeing to be responsible for the child at the child's birth. They don't track down sperm and egg donors to sign the birth certificates. So weird and problematic.", ">it would be considered a huge civil liberties issue for the U.S. government to maintain a DNA database on all its \n\nYou don't have to maintain one though. In my limited knowledge of DNA tests, it would just be comparative wouldn't it? No need to store information for questions that have binary answers (yes/no).\n\nEdit: If the down-votes are cause I'm not addressing the post. OP is definitely a deadbeat dad, regardless of the outcome he supposedly raised this girl as his own for years before the divorce. Daughter should be careful publicly lambasting OP, but her behavior is understandable. OP is certainly firmly over the YTA threshold.\n\nIf its cause I'm naive, haha yeah I agree.", "> and it's usually closer to 4-5%\n\nI mean, I'm not supporting the OP, but damn.

And it doesn't mean that all women should be treated as liars until proven otherwise. How do you feel about all men being treated as rapists and abusers just because some do it?\n\nIf a man doubts his partner is being truthful about paternity, he can nut up, ask for the test, and deal with the fallout on his own.
