Katie and her husband Vincent (37M) have two sons: Forrest (13M) and Fergus (11M).\r  \n\r  \nEvery year, Thanksgiving is held at my house and this year is no exception. However, this year we have a new guest: Forrest\u2019s girlfriend, Scarlett (13F). Scarlett is a sweet kid, she\u2019s also autistic and one of her special interests is baking and cooking. When Forrest invited Scarlett to come to Thanksgiving (with my permission), she asked if she could help with the food. I agreed to this. \r  \n\r  \nYesterday, I had Forrest and Scarlett over so Scarlett could help plan what we were making, while Forrest was playing some games with my 5 y/o son. \r  \n\r  \nWe had discussed the main course dishes, like turkey and mashed potatoes and had started to talk about dessert. Scarlett said she had some ideas for creative desserts, and I listened. She wanted to make some baseball-themed cake or cookies for Forrest, and I told her that was a fine idea, I then asked her about also trying some other themed stuff that she or other kids may like. I had asked if maybe we should do something Star Wars or anime themed for Fergus but she told me Forrest would hate that. I was confused as to what she meant and she said that Forrest always calls Fergus an a-hole and doesn't like him.\r  \n\r  \nThis suprised me, so I asked what she meant. She then told me that Fergus was making some extremly sexist remarks both about Scarlett and in general. Saying stuff like it's good Scarlett bakes because \"that's where women belong\" or saying that women were more \"feeble-minded\".\r  \n\r  \nI was horrifed by this and asked Forrest to elaborate, he told me everything and that he didn't tell me earlier because he worried I would get mad at him because when he brought it up to his parents, they said not to be a \"snitch\" or a \"tattletale\",\r  \n\r  \nI called Katie after this and she started to get upset at me and asking why I would encourage Forrest and Scarlett to be \"tattletales\" and said \"just because you were a tattletale as a kid doesn't mean I want my kids to be tattletales\". She would not let me get a word in so I hung up. \r  \n\r  \nWhen Katie came to pick Forrest and Scarlett up, I told her that her, Vincent and Fergus were no longer invited to Thanksgiving until she apologized for yelling at me. She refused and drove off.\r  \n\r  \nSince then, I have been getting messages on Facebook from numerous relatives saying that I am being unfair and should call Katie and re-invite her. I think that Katie is in the wrong, and my husband agrees to, but given the pure backlash I've got from my family I am not entirely sure. AITA?

The children weren't being tattletales, they were being open about how they were handling a difficult situation.  Your response was reasonable.  Your sister's was not.  She's being a bad parent, a bad woman, and a bad sister right now.  Hopefully she gets her head screwed on straight.", "NTA. It always amazes me how people rush to defense of the bully. Hold firm, you\u2019re doing that family a favor.", "cheese and rice.  letting your sister know that one of her kids is a blossoming little misogynist isn't \"tattling\".  i'm going to go ahead and bet that none of your family knows the real reason why you uninvited her.  is she the one who announced their un-invitation?  why don't you go ahead and announce the reason why?   because part of the reason is that your sister tattled on you - exactly the thing she accused you of.  hello pot, meet kettle.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nKatie is acting like a child. \n\nShe apparently has no problem when her son spouts misogynistic opinions that are way too old for a nine-year-old and so he's obviously learning them from an adult. Strike 1.\n\nShe automatically views confiding in a trusted adult about another child's problematic behavior as \"tattling\" regardless of the context. Strike 2. \n\nShe refuses to engage in an adult conversation with an adult that she trusts to supervise her children when that adult wants to discuss problematic behavior of her children. Strike 3.\n\nYou are not this child's mom, but you also don't have to acquiesce to her bullshit. You have the right attitude that Katie is the problem. You are well within your right to draw boundaries for yourself. \n\nMost adults would want to know if their kid was being a little shit and would also feel happy that there is another adult invested in their child's well-being. I definitely am. If my kid was friends with one of her kids and she had the same reaction when I bought it up, I wouldn't let my kid be friends with that kid anymore. Her behavior is super isolating for her kids, and it honestly makes me concerned for their welfare.\n\nIf she thinks you were sticking your nose into her business, then she's entitled to that opinion. If she doesn't like that you actually want to listen to these kids and understand their problems and if she wants to say \"my way or the highway!\", then that's her right. What she doesn't get to continue to use you for free childcare while ignoring your boundaries. \n\nYou are also well within your rights to say that her behavior *towards you* was unacceptable. Yelling at you and berating you are unacceptable. She doesn't get to feel entitled to your free childcare, your holiday planning, and whatever other time and energy as if you're just a robot. \n\nYou are also allowed to tell her that you don't want your younger children learning misogynistic language from their older cousin, and if she's not going to reign that behavior in, then she and her son is not welcome at her home.", "NTA\n\nThe sad part is she probably punished Forrest for \u201ctattling\u201d but hasn\u2019t done a damn thing about her 11 year old calling women nothing more than bang maids.", "On the one hand, this is your home, and you can do whatever you see fit. You were pointing out pretty negative behavior, as well, which is not parenting someone else's kid: it's putting the ball in the court of the parents to do their job. The way they responded is incredibly troubling, as well, and while Thanksgiving is supposed to be a time when we put grievances temporarily aside, there are still boundaries, and if you feel that one (or several) have been crossed, remember: it's your house.\n\nAt the same time, I'm concerned for Forrest and his girlfriend, because your decision to stand firm here is only going to reinforce this attitude about \"tattling.\" Ultimately that's not on you, per se,  but it does put those two in a bad position.\n\nFor me, this isn't quite ESH, but neither is it a complete NTA. You could have handled the situation a little better, but your sister and her husband are enabling bad behavior, actively undermining one of their children, and actively \"tattling\" about this to other family members to get them on their side, which just reeks of hypocrisy. It's no wonder you feel the way you do.", "ESH.  It's okay for you to bring this to Katie's attention and she's an AH for being more concerned about tattling. You're the AH because uninviting her impacts the rest of the family getting to see her.  It also effectively uninvites Forrest and Scarlett.", "ESH.\n\nIt\u2019s not on you to tell someone else to raise their kids or you\u2019ll kick them out of the family.\n\nI agree the parents should do something but since you didn\u2019t even hear the brother insult women/girls, you\u2019re being harsh.", "YBTA\n\nAnd this is just purely because of my own family dynamic\n\nI would show up anyway and have a calm, civilized and non-confrontational chat about hurt feelings and explain how I feel I deserved an apology. And the other party would listen and we would work it out right there. I wouldn't go through ruining what is supposed to be beautiful family time for such a petty disagreement. When it can be worked out thoroughly in person, without having to de-invite family members.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If I had to guess, she probably started the conversation like any reasonable adult would with Katie by asking if what Scarlett told her had any merit. We don't really know how that convos went down, but there are a lot of red flags with how OP has described Katie's behavior."]}
