Turns out I could not. I fell and landed on my elbow. My SIL came out and immediately helped me and I assured her that this was my own ego that got me hurt, and she and Connor were not to blame (she thought he\u2019d goaded me into it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater that night, I was in an extreme amount of pain, so my mom took me to the hospital. After a lot of run around, it turns out I have a really bad bone bruise. I\u2019m not supposed to lift ant weight with that arm until my physical therapist says otherwise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was finally given the green light to start PT last week. The person I\u2019m seeing is a student, but the person supervising her, \u201cAnna,\u201d turned out to be Adam\u2019s mother. Small world! I hadn\u2019t met her on Halloween night because Adam\u2019s dad dropped him off and came back to get him while she stayed home with their younger kids. We talked about the kids and it was a nice connection to make.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday, I went back to my brother and SIL\u2019s house for Thanksgiving. While my SIL and I were chatting, she mentioned that Anna told her that we met while I was being treated at PT. I didn\u2019t say anything in the moment because I knew it would upset my SIL, but it really bothers me that Anna told my SIL I was being treated by her and, by extension, where. My SIL is not listed as someone they can reveal any information to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI now feel insecure at the thought of going back to that same physical therapy location, and I\u2019m going to get my information transferred to another facility. I just can\u2019t know what else may have been revealed about me, or what else Anna may say to my SIL or anyone else. I want to file a HIPAA complaint so that this is looked into because I don\u2019t want this to happen to anyone else and I want better training at this place going forward. I don\u2019t want an apology or anything like that because it honestly won\u2019t make any difference for me. But it might make things awkward for my SIL in the future, and I don\u2019t want it to potentially affect Connor and Adam\u2019s friendship.

Client confidentiality and privacy is a right, she broke the law.", "[deleted]", "a few things to think about\n\nwhat is your desired outcome?  you say better training, etc., but specifically re \"anna\" and this PT place?  are you hoping for her termination?  and often the institution is on the hook for these kinds of violations, so they may shut down as well if it's a smaller place, as the fines for HIPAA violations can be steep.  \n\nwhat specifically was disclosed?  HIPAA allows entities to disclose your name, location, and general condition to people who ask about you by name, as long as you have the opportunity to agree or object.  your SIL may not be someone you specifically listed to have PHI disclosed to, but that's separate from declining inclusion in a facility directory.\n\nwhy was that information disclosed?  unless explicitly told otherwise, providers are allowed to inform friends/family/etc if they feel it's in the interest of the person & their condition. as an example, if your SIL was talking about having you help decorate or cook a 30lb turkey, and \"anna\" then advised against it because of your condition, then that's generally considered ok unless you had explicitly said otherwise", "I\u2019ve been a nurse for 23 years. I would think it would depend on what was said. If your were in the hospital and your SIL called and asked if you were there we could say yes if you weren\u2019t listed as a confidential patient. We couldn\u2019t answer much more than that. I would assume it\u2019s the same with PT. If your therapist went into detail about your treatment then that would most definitely be a hippa violation. Facilities tend to have stricter rules than the hippa laws so it might get your PT in trouble with their boss.", "I think I'm misunderstanding something. If she just told sister in law that she met you at PT, that doesn't say she's treating you or anything about why. It's just a location. Is that also a HIPAA violation? I'm not educated on this.", "Did your SIL know you were receiving PT? Did she know where you were receiving it? \n\nEven if SIL brought it up first, yes she still violated HIPPA as she should have said \"HIPPA prevents me from confirming or denying anything, you know I can't respond to that\". \n\nAs far as HIPPA goes, it's lower on the offenses and while still illegal - likely won't ge fired but absolutely would get reprimanded. Sometimes fined.\n\n If your SIl already knew you started PT, there wasn't a whole lot of harm coming from this thoughdespite the yes its illegal, and I understand your concern for trust and professionalism from it. You have every right to report it, but if I didn't feel the harm caused was worth it. I wouldn't. Instead I'd talk to the person directly. Or alert the clinic without name dropping so all have to be reminded. \n\nThis happens quite a bit and actually happened when I went to PT... The secratary who worked there when I went, used to work in a clinic I worked at before and ended up telling my old manager she saw me there but I think I had mentioned something like \"Oh say Hi to Stephanie for me\" so I had put her in that position. Within my family, my FIL would tell us he would see his niece in law at cardiac rehab and she'd confirm yes she sees him there because she knows we already know. I accidently did this as well - I saw a father of a friend once and he atopped me and said hello while I was at work. And then he told his son and I confirmed oh yeah I did see him. I didn't know who he was there to see or why but still I said I saw him at the doctors office. It doesn't make it right, but it's much easier to slip up in these cases. It absolutely does not mean I, or either of those people, would share medical history though or go into anything like that. \n\nYou are well within your right to report it. But that doesn't mean there won't be repercussions for you or won't be seen as an AH by SIL", "NTA. \n\nPatient confidentiality is important. I'm not sure how much of that transfers to PT, but guaranteed if she's talking about you, she talks about other patients. \n\nInformation privacy is very important.", "I would confront her (adamms mum) and tell her that you are not reporting her because of existing relationships. So you can be assertive and she may understand her mistake. Maybe", "NTA - Her next violation could be  worse.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Am willing to bet she received training to never do that.", "I\u2019m going to say YTA. Legally, it is a violation but it\u2019s such a small thing that I think immediately reporting her is aggressive. A conversation with her about you being uncomfortable with her telling Anna you were her patient is enough.", "NTA. I always tell my docs when something is okay like texting a surgeon on my behalf to ask what happened (finger surgery). It was easier than trying to contact the other office myself. In this case, she may have slipped due to the connection but that does NOT make it okay. I don't know the office setting but it a large place perhaps inquire if they have someone who handles inquiries/complaints or an admin supervisor/manager and express that you would like a follow up. My boss handles HIPAA where I work and sometimes there are accidents and if nothing bad/malicious, it's not that big of a deal but looking into training and advising that person is important. I can't believe it would effect her career...It is not like she is going around and telling stories about your treatment.", "NAH. Not a HIPAA expert, but with the info you provided it doesn't sound like any violation has occurred.

You were friendly with her, were talking about the kids.  It was a nice connection to make.  There is no evidence anything specifics were mentioned.

You are definitely NTA and I strongly encourage you to file the complaint. Please OP read through to my examples below for my reasoning. (Sorry for the long mesg)\n\nHIPAA exists to distinguish exactly what is and isnt protected so that no one person has to decide where the threshold is for breach of privacy. How an offenders employer chooses to treat that violation is not on you and you should never ever feel bad for it.\n\nLet's be honest, anyone who has this kind of career is not someone who just rolls up to a job, punches a clock and does simple work. \n\nProviders have to sign major confidentiality agreements that often come with legal repercussions clearly laid out should they violate that confidentiality. \nThey have job offers that point to HIPAA regulations and they likely have received way more copies of employer handbooks, fact sheets and HIPAA highlights than they could ever possibly need. \n\nIt's kinda like WHMIS for labourers lol (and we all just collectively rolled our eye). Ie. you don't get to do your job without having to be made aware over and over and over (and over) what the HIPAA regulations are and what the expectations are of you as an employee. \n\nAka, she knows the law, she knows she is violating the law and she doesn't care.\n\nIt doesnt matter what your condition is as the patient, when someone is privy to all of your personal information they have no right to discuss it. \n\nEven if that person is your best friend, your next door neighbour, or your kid's, friend's mother. \n\nProviders fall into one of two categories:\n\n1) they take HIPAA incredibly seriously and will not breach it for any reason barring a warrant (even then they often get legal assistance involved).\n\n2) they don't and they blab information.\n\nAny care provider who so casually relays this information is not doing it just this once. You aren't the first and won't be the last.\n\nWhen I am presented with a question like you face now, knowing my report could cause someone a problem, I like to determine my response based on how that behaviour could impact others.\n\nExample 1:\n\nLet's say you fill out the forms on your first visit, they are one of the more progressive offices that ask you to identify your pronouns. \n\nYou indicate they/them.\n\n(You have not had this identity discussion with your family for whatever your reasons are)\n\nYour name comes up in conversation and while telling your SIL that she is treating you  she says \"oh actually, I started treating them (not her) last week\". Maybe your SIL doesn't pick up on it, but as the conversation goes on, she uses your requested pronouns several times. Suddenly you have a major problem. \n\nExample 2:\n(Since someone made a comment above about how she could discuss \"a patient\" without naming them)\n\n\nImagine you're sitting in a restaurant and you overhear the discussion happening at the next table.\n\nThey don't use a patients name, but the details are so specific that anyone who is familiar with the patient, or has second/third hand knowledge of an accident would easily recognize who is being discussed. \n\nThe provider isn't mincing words because it's not like they are giving away personal/identifying information anyways right? Wrong. \n\nThere are so many ways it could go badly, and I don't just mean the provider is being a racist, judgemental, rude asshole etc.\n\nMaybe someone is keeping an injury quiet because they cant take time off/lose their job, perhaps they have a mental health condition or a tragic diagnosis of some form. \n\nSure these things don't necessarily pertain to her role as a PT, but we as patients have a tendency to chit chat with our extended health care providers (think PT, chiro, massage etc.) kinda like we do our hairdresser/barber.\n\nAnyways, my whole point is that it may be minor in your case, but it could be major for someone else. When you file your report, you explain what the violation was, so I'd let them determine the level of response needed. Whether its a slap on the wrist or more serious, that's why these governing bodies exist.", "NTA.

While yes it is wrong that she even mentioned it, it is a unique case that I would need more information to accurately give an answer.", "It may be that your SIL told Anna about your injury, and that only then Anna said something. Honestly, she didn\u2019t disclose your personal information, and literally anyone can see you attend a healthcare service. Unless she has been telling your SIL about anything else specific about you, I think you are being OTT", "It's HIPAA.", "Would op automatically be named publicly?", "I\u2019m gonna say he looking for a payday. Reports her then tries to sue her. Why else would someone risk a relationship with their family, for something like this, if not for the chance at some money?", "Have you considered that SIL may have said something about your injury to start with?", "Found the PT/Adam's mom y'all!", "The importance of zero tolerance with HIPAA and things like it is most visible in situations so complex or convoluted as to be edge cases. So here's an edge case. Keep in mind here, that PT doesn't have any context. Any tiny piece of information is a bullet for someone's force-multiplier, somewhere.\n\nOP is injured on Brother's property and has to get an ambulance ride and ER visit paid for. So he goes after Brother's homeowner's insurer for payment, as is reasonable. The only reason OP goes to PT is to make sure his case against the insurer is solid. SIL learns about OP's medical care and connects the dots about a lawsuit against the insurer. OP is cut off from the family or has harm done to them for \"betrayal\" or being \"greedy\".  \n\n\nThe stakes can be as high as someone's life or livelihood. You respect that or you stay out of this field.

Even in court things are not clear cut!", "You know that sometimes people do not want to share ANYTHING medical,  even with their damily members, nevermind with someone so abstract title as \"family friend\". I mean sometimes not even the fact that they had a medical issue, nevermind where and by whom it is treated. And sometimes it is for serious reasons.\n\nIt is not for medical expert to decide if they can tell info."]}
