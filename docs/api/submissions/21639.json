Just go and have fun if you can do it.\n\nI live half the USA away from where I grew up and where most of my family lives.

If you can, just go.", "NTA\n\nAnyone planning a destination wedding would at least make sure that the key people who matter to them are onboard with it. OP's brother just planned an inconvenient trip/wedding without consulting with his closest family members. He also doesn't seem to care that OP didn't attend. It doesn't make sense to make such an outlay of time/money for someone to whom it doesn't matter that much whether OP is there or not. Whether it was affordable to OP or not, is irrelevant.", "YTA.  I was prepared to go the other way until I read that you had no real barrier at all to going to this wedding, just that you were salty about his plans and are calling it a \u201cprinciple\u201d.", "NTA \n\nHe would've been upset or tried to convince you to come if you or your attendance was at all important to him or his wife.  Seems it was not.", "YTA. Come on dude. It's your brother.", "NAH\n\nWhen you have a destination you prepare for people not going. If having everyone there was more important to them they would have chosen a location closer to home. \n\nI\u2019m sure you would have gone if you were closer to your brother. It is what it is.", "NTA them saving $400 means everyone else must spend hundreds in travel/lodging? Booooo. \n\nAlso, r/GeorgiaorGeorgia", "NTA simply because your brother doesn\u2019t care - he was probably expecting to have less people attending because of his choice of wedding date and place", "I\u2019m going to say NTA because you weren\u2019t obligated to go and your brother doesn\u2019t seem to to mind. However, I do want to point out two major flaws in your argument. First, unless you were going to give him the $400, you have no right to criticize your brother for trying to save some money on his wedding. He probably didn\u2019t only save money on the cost to reserve the beach. Weekday weddings are way cheaper than weekend weddings because wedding vendors usually get little to no business during the week, so they\u2019re happy to give discounts if it means they can make some money. \n\nSecond, regardless of where your brother held his wedding, you probably would have had to take a day off to attend regardless because you don\u2019t live in the same city he does. For example, if the wedding was on Saturday, you would have had to fly out on Friday. His wedding would have been an inconvenience for you no matter where it was so I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re on such a high horse about it.", "It's your brother. YTA absent good reason not to go other than being cheap and upset at him being cheap.", "You are the asshole. If you're on good terms, you should be there for him, especially at an event of such importance.", "YTA only because it clearly would not have caused you any real hardship to go. If you couldn\u2019t afford it or couldn\u2019t take the time off of work, that would be one thing, but you\u2019ve got the money and you\u2019re sitting on vacation days that you have zero desire to use otherwise.", "YTA. You didn't have that much to sacrifice. Like you said, you didn't have plans for your vacation days, so taking a few days off wouldn't have been too much. \n\n>no interest in travelling that far to go to a location I'm not interested in at all\n\nThe wedding's about him, and *he's* the one who likes the location. He can't please all his guests with his choice. Also, weddings are expensive, so $400 was a good save for him.\n\nOverall, it would've been good to support him at this important step in his life, because, as you stated, you have a good relationship with him, and there weren't many guests, so adding another person likely would've made it better for him.", "So what you\u2019re saying is that you had absolutely no reason not to go to your brothers wedding, but you were choosing that time to make a statement about how he inconvenienced others? I\u2019m glad there\u2019s no jealousy or animosity or lack of care that led to your decision.", "YTA", "YTA. Would have been nice for you to be there and or doesn\u2019t sound like it would have been a real burden. At the very least it seems that it would have been nice for your dad to see his sons together at one of their weddings", "YTA BUT he probably had a much better time without his miserable sod of a sibling there", "YTA", "Absolutely YTA.

That\u2019s not a family reunion.", "People who choose weekday weddings to save themselves money are prioritizing cost over attendance. Plain and simple. And they know it. Her brother didn't even care she wasn't there.", "The wedding was on a beach for 15 people so I'm pretty sure the $400 was half the total budget it ended up being or something around that much.\n\nAnd arguably weddings are about the FAMILY and not the people getting married. Although, by that logic I should have attended anyway so it would have been a more complete family gathering.", "Good one.", "If you read the first two sentences of my comment, you\u2019ll see that I acknowledged that the brother didn\u2019t care and I voted NTA because of it. My overall point is OP\u2019s so called principle is heavily flawed.", "YTA\n\nThere's something so hollow and performative about this 'principle' lol, I think it's ultimately a self serving ego trip on your part.\n\nWhat did you think you were achieving by not going? Did you think your 'wildly inconvenienced' family members would hail you as their hero or something?\n\nETA Like, are your family members incapable of planning their own lives and making decisions for themselves?", "YTA. I normally have no reservations with NTA on destination weddings but your hang up seems to be that he\u2019s having his wedding on a Monday rather than being a destination wedding. You open with that you and your brother have a good relationship which I doubt since you couldn\u2019t be bothered to attend a Monday wedding.\n\nYou listed 3 reasons but still settled on the Monday problem so he could save $400 dollars you probably invented. \n \nIf he had his destination wedding on a Sunday you\u2019d fly to Georgia and back that weekend and be back to work on Monday?\n\nHe clearly doesn\u2019t live in Georgia so a destination wedding on a Monday isn\u2019t saving money. The real issue is that you don\u2019t want to take a Monday off", "I mean, yeah, kinda. Sometimes doing things on principle is stupid, like in this case. It\u2019s not *your* wedding, it\u2019s your brothers and he can do it whichever way he wants. You not going simply because you don\u2019t like how he planned **his** wedding is stupid.", "I mean I don\u2019t know you so it feels weird saying this, but I think YTA. I hear you and don\u2019t disagree with your logic, buts it\u2019s your brother. You could have gone, but chose not to, which is fine for anyone else, but if you\u2019re not willing to give a little for your brother who would you be willing to give in a little to?", "So you could go\u2026 but you didn\u2019t coz\u2026. Meh .. not sure what I should vote for.", "YTA. Just obviously are.", "i don\u2019t know about this one. i mean technically, no, you\u2019re not an asshole for not going to an expensive, time-consuming destination wedding, but you generally sound like an unpleasant human to be around and i wouldn\u2019t call you in an emergency. you had the money and the time it took, you really just didn\u2019t bother to put in a bit of effort for a person who you say you have a good relationship with and care about. NTA, but if i were your brother i\u2019d be disappointed- even if he doesn\u2019t voice it up, he probably is.", "Imo YTA as you had the means, ability etc to go and no reason not to be supporting your brother. Family support one another. You haven't.\n\nI live 3000 miles away and would gladly have attended to support my sibling.\n\nWhat goes around comes around...", "NTA \n\nBut damn y'all have some weird ass family dynamics in the U.S. I mean, I understand saving for yourself and literally whatever the hell you want, but what is the point of earning all this money if it's not for things like this? Like family? Yes, I'm judging. But it's your happiness and your brother's happiness and that's all that matters.", "YTA. Yes you are, purely for your reasoning.\n\nMaking a point was more important to you than seeing your brother get married. If you couldn't go, no problem, but you could.\n\nPeople can choose to get married wherever they like. If the rest of the family didn't mind being inconvenienced and went anyway then they didn't need you to stand up for them.\n\nYou just didn't want to go and seized on the inconvenience as a justifiable reason.", "NTA-I wouldn't go either he's really asking too much of his guests to take off work, fly, get a hotel, rent a car, probably pay for the drinks at the reception too it wasn't planned well at all.", "NTA, people who arrange destination weddings should expect that not everyone can attend or want to attend.", "ESH - he picked an inconvenient option, but your reasoning to skip his big event is \"well, it's inconvenient\". That's a pretty lazy excuse.", "Destination wedding? NTA.", "Info: Georgia the country or Georgia the USA state?", "INFO: when you say recently, did you mean this past Monday? Because I could very much understand doing it this Monday to save money, since everyone had off Tuesday. \n\nAlso, how many people were invited? You say only about 15 attended, but was that out of 20 or 100?\n\nYou say you aren't close with your brother, but missing his wedding isn't going to make you closer. Though it seems like you are fine with that.", "No assholes here, by the looks of it.", "NTA. If you choose to have a destination wedding you need to accept that some people, who might otherwise be expected to attend, won\u2019t. It seems brother did accept this and had no objections to OP not attending. Others should not be getting offended on his behalf.", "NTA purely out of indifference on the part of your brother; given the time and location of his wedding, he probably anticipated fewer guests.", "NTA.\nPlanning a destination wedding instantly cuts down the guest list. (Very different if OP was returning to their home town for an event after moving overseas)\n\nPlanning a wedding on a Monday cuts down the guest list.\n\nThese outcomes are very predictable so the brother has knowingly made these decision. \n\nIf he\u2019d offered to pay for OP to fly that might\u2019ve been different as it indicated his desire for OP to attend. but it\u2019s clear he didn\u2019t care either way.

Especially if money and vacation days aren't an issue. OP also says they have a good relationship. I'd go with ESH on this one too, for all the reasons you listed.", "I can\u2019t get over that the Inconvenience was that he had his wedding on a Monday to save $400. Based on that reason it seems he had no problem flying out on a Saturday, attending a wedding Sunday and flying back Sunday night. The inconvenience was that the wedding was on a Monday to save $400", "That statement stuck out to me too; it's not a sightseeing trip, it's his wedding.", "No, $400 because it was on a Monday instead.

Doesn\u2019t matter where the brother got married OP would\u2019ve had to do all those things regardless. Which OP readily admits he could easily do. Is the brother expected to fly to where OP lives to get married?", "Would you have traveled 1,000 miles to attend had he spent the $400 to have the wedding on a Saturday instead of a Monday?", "No, but the point is that he shouldn\u2019t expect as many people to come and the way OP told it, it seems he understood that since he didn\u2019t mind. Only AH is dad here", "It\u2019s enough people to be parents and siblings, possibly some grandparents, which is a rare enough occasion for many families. And OP won\u2019t be on the wedding fotos, which often double as family fotos. I get that the dad is sad about it and has a hard time expressing that, hence calling OP an AH", "All the more time to have geniue conversations and reconnect with people?\nBut each to ones own", "He had no problem with it being a destination wedding, the issue was that it was on a Monday. If he could jet set a 1,000 miles for a weekend trip (brothers wedding) but draws the line on Mondays he\u2019s an AH. Who does destination weddings to save $400?", "Lmao I hate wedding culture but also absolutely not. The wedding is about the people getting married, not the family.", "Where does your brother live? Does he live in Georgia? You would have done the destination wedding had it been on a Sunday instead of a Monday? If he lives in Georgia \u201cfuck that guy for saving $400\u201d for having his wedding on a Monday?\n\nIf not they travelled 1,000 miles to save $400 total budget on a beach on a Monday?", "Yeah, I think destination weddings within the US aren't nearly as much of a problem as a fancy resort in another country. A lot of guests will have to travel anyway, it doesn't much matter if it's a beach or the town where the brother lives.", "I always wonder the same thing when people talk about these being destination weddings. If you don\u2019t live near family, even your home city is a \u201cdestination\u201d for guests. I live in GA and my family lives in AZ, TX, SD, and PA. Where am I supposed to get married that isn\u2019t an inconvenience?", "Shocker the brother didn\u2019t care this brother didn\u2019t show up for his wedding"]}
