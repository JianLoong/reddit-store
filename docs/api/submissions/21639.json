Monday weddings suck.\n* The dad: Needs to accept that Monday and destination weddings suck, and some people will choose not to go.\n* You: You could go.  You could totally go, take the PTO, and afford it.  You didn't because of some dumb principle?  Why? Just go and have fun if you can do it.\n\nI live half the USA away from where I grew up and where most of my family lives.  When there is a wedding (or other event), I go if I can because weddings are fun, and it's great to see my extended family.\n\nYes, it's about the wedding, but it's also about family reunion.  If you can, just go.", "NTA\n\nAnyone planning a destination wedding would at least make sure that the key people who matter to them are onboard with it. OP's brother just planned an inconvenient trip/wedding without consulting with his closest family members. He also doesn't seem to care that OP didn't attend. It doesn't make sense to make such an outlay of time/money for someone to whom it doesn't matter that much whether OP is there or not. Whether it was affordable to OP or not, is irrelevant.", "YTA.  I was prepared to go the other way until I read that you had no real barrier at all to going to this wedding, just that you were salty about his plans and are calling it a \u201cprinciple\u201d.", "NTA \n\nHe would've been upset or tried to convince you to come if you or your attendance was at all important to him or his wife.  Seems it was not.", "YTA. Come on dude. It's your brother.", "NAH\n\nWhen you have a destination you prepare for people not going. If having everyone there was more important to them they would have chosen a location closer to home. \n\nI\u2019m sure you would have gone if you were closer to your brother. It is what it is.", "NTA them saving $400 means everyone else must spend hundreds in travel/lodging? Booooo. \n\nAlso, r/GeorgiaorGeorgia", "NTA simply because your brother doesn\u2019t care - he was probably expecting to have less people attending because of his choice of wedding date and place", "I\u2019m going to say NTA because you weren\u2019t obligated to go and your brother doesn\u2019t seem to to mind. However, I do want to point out two major flaws in your argument. First, unless you were going to give him the $400, you have no right to criticize your brother for trying to save some money on his wedding. He probably didn\u2019t only save money on the cost to reserve the beach. Weekday weddings are way cheaper than weekend weddings because wedding vendors usually get little to no business during the week, so they\u2019re happy to give discounts if it means they can make some money. \n\nSecond, regardless of where your brother held his wedding, you probably would have had to take a day off to attend regardless because you don\u2019t live in the same city he does. For example, if the wedding was on Saturday, you would have had to fly out on Friday. His wedding would have been an inconvenience for you no matter where it was so I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re on such a high horse about it.", "It's your brother. YTA absent good reason not to go other than being cheap and upset at him being cheap.", "You are the asshole. If you're on good terms, you should be there for him, especially at an event of such importance.", "YTA only because it clearly would not have caused you any real hardship to go. If you couldn\u2019t afford it or couldn\u2019t take the time off of work, that would be one thing, but you\u2019ve got the money and you\u2019re sitting on vacation days that you have zero desire to use otherwise.", "YTA. You didn't have that much to sacrifice. Like you said, you didn't have plans for your vacation days, so taking a few days off wouldn't have been too much. \n\n>no interest in travelling that far to go to a location I'm not interested in at all\n\nThe wedding's about him, and *he's* the one who likes the location. He can't please all his guests with his choice. Also, weddings are expensive, so $400 was a good save for him.\n\nOverall, it would've been good to support him at this important step in his life, because, as you stated, you have a good relationship with him, and there weren't many guests, so adding another person likely would've made it better for him.", "So what you\u2019re saying is that you had absolutely no reason not to go to your brothers wedding, but you were choosing that time to make a statement about how he inconvenienced others? I\u2019m glad there\u2019s no jealousy or animosity or lack of care that led to your decision.", "YTA", "YTA. Would have been nice for you to be there and or doesn\u2019t sound like it would have been a real burden. At the very least it seems that it would have been nice for your dad to see his sons together at one of their weddings", "YTA BUT he probably had a much better time without his miserable sod of a sibling there", "YTA", "Absolutely YTA.

Her brother didn't even care she wasn't there.", "The wedding was on a beach for 15 people so I'm pretty sure the $400 was half the total budget it ended up being or something around that much.\n\nAnd arguably weddings are about the FAMILY and not the people getting married. Although, by that logic I should have attended anyway so it would have been a more complete family gathering.", "Good one.", "If you read the first two sentences of my comment, you\u2019ll see that I acknowledged that the brother didn\u2019t care and I voted NTA because of it.
