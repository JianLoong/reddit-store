Recently she asked for my help with and errand, I said yes as I was in town running errands anyway. When I dropped off what she needed she asked if I would send the money back to her account that was left over. I said yes of course because it was no big deal. However she was pressuring me to hurry up and send it. When doing this I got frustrated and hit the wrong account and hit send. Keep in mind it was 30$ I explained to her that I sent it to a friends account and would send her the money the next day because the banks were closed (It was sunday). After I explained my mistake and apologized, she proceeded to yell at me and call me a liar. I left to go home to put away groceries I had in my car. By the time I had got home she had called me 26 times. I finally answered when I pulled into the driveway and she started screaming at me and telling me she wanted the flowers back she bought for my bouquet or 100$ cash.

I think it was an addict considering the way a partial bag like the corner on my desk after being there. As well as someone putting a lines on my countertop. I sometime drink and use marijuana CBD for stress. I have also had to drug test myself as some has been slipping MDMA, xanax and Ativan in my drinks without my consent. As I was pregnant and I believe my mother and sibling who have fertility issues have been trying to make a case to get my child. Yet that won't even happen anymore due the the stress they put me through cussing me to miscarry. As well as someone trying to steal 25000 and have had 1500 worth of phones go missing. Making me fail out of college. On top of someone intercepting communications preventing me from getting a real job. As these people are hackers an have my SSN and are very technically advanced. As well as someone opening credit card and stealing cash app card and credit cards and maxing them out and not paying. So I understand having to ask people for help to eat and make phone payment. Yet these people blackmailed me and said I had to do sex work or well drugs. If you did it because you didn't want to pay a debt that's kinda crappy but over all it's your wedding. There may have been miscommunication on it being a gift vs a loan having someone apay apart of your wedding and not inviting them is extremely shitty. ESH.", "This is beyond absurd. No way any rational person would cut ties with a family member or friend for a simple mistake of mailing off a check to the wrong address. Not having a relationship with your sibling for something as simple as that and holding a grudge over an honest mistake for 30 years is absolutely not normal. It's absolutely, mind bogglingly ridiculous.", "My guess is that since the sister was already acting erratically - OP says the reason she made the mistake in the first place is because her sister was being relentless about getting the $30 back immediately - OP decided she was done, and noped out of there to get space. Unfortunately the sister was not prepared to wait.\n\nIf the sister *is* an addict (as her family apparently suspect, per one of OP's comments), then giving in to the demand for immediacy would be enabling, I guess.\n\nEdit: In another comment, OP says\n\n\"She has been treating me this way for years, I let her back in and try to forgive and this stuff happens every time\"\n\nThis strengthens my \"so done with her shit\" theory. OP has seen elements of this before, but maybe not to the extent it reached this time.", "Interesting that the OP answered almost every response but this one\u2026..", "Not everyone has $60 spare.", "Yes - all the other posts have been answered?!", "Probably cause $30 shouldn't be that big of a deal.\n\nIf Im OP and I missent. Im probably gonna be a bit lazy and delay the transfer. But then again my family is not unhinged. They wouldn't care if I send the $30 Tomorrow or never.", "\"Her sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and her family come barreling over for $100?\"\n\nNo - OP as with *her* fiance and his family when the sister came over to yell at her. No-one else was supporting the sister in her meltdown.\n\nI think the answer to most of the rest of your questions (e.g. why does she suddenly want 100 when she's only owed 30) is that the sister was not thinking or acting rationally. She has anger issues and/or is an addict, as others have suggested."]}
