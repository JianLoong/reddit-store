However, after what she did I revoked her invite. Let me explain. My sister and I have had a rocky relationship for the past couple years. About 3 months ago I tried moving on and fixing the relationship. Things were good for a while. We talked, hung out, and even FaceTimed almost everyday. She even bought my wedding bouquet as a gift. Recently she asked for my help with and errand, I said yes as I was in town running errands anyway. When I dropped off what she needed she asked if I would send the money back to her account that was left over. I said yes of course because it was no big deal. However she was pressuring me to hurry up and send it. When doing this I got frustrated and hit the wrong account and hit send. Keep in mind it was 30$ I explained to her that I sent it to a friends account and would send her the money the next day because the banks were closed (It was sunday). After I explained my mistake and apologized, she proceeded to yell at me and call me a liar. I left to go home to put away groceries I had in my car. By the time I had got home she had called me 26 times. I finally answered when I pulled into the driveway and she started screaming at me and telling me she wanted the flowers back she bought for my bouquet or 100$ cash. I explained that I didn\u2019t have to give those back as they were a gift. I reminded her that her 30$ would be back in her account in the morning. She ended up driving to my house with my fianc\u00e9 and his entire family there and started screaming at me and accusing me of cheating on my fianc\u00e9 with his best friend. Showing my fianc\u00e9s family pictures from my fianc\u00e9s birthday party. It was a picture of me, my fianc\u00e9 and his best friend sitting together. I want to add that I love my fianc\u00e9 and we are very happy together. I have never not will I ever cheat. I\u2019m not that kind of person. In the midst of her yelling and saying crazy things my neighbor walked out and tried to resolve the issue. My sister proceeded to call him dumb and my best friend fat. My neighbor handed her 100$ cash so she would leave. After leaving she proceed to message me and my fianc\u00e9s family on Facebook more lies. I got irritated and told her she couldn\u2019t attend the wedding. I was hear broken and hurt. I worked so hard to make things better. Why would she go to these lengths over 30$? Why would she disrespect me in front of my fianc\u00e9 and family? I am not sure if I am wrong for taking away the invite, so I need to know AITA?", "created_utc": 1685140014, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13sqe4m/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_cant_attend_my/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A withdrawl of normal social interactions. Appearing tired/listless/restless, with a sudden boost of energy after leaving a bathroom/bedroom or whatever. \n\n3)Shadiness in interactions: needed to step out to make a phone call, secretive about their whereabouts. Showing up late to planned activities (had to wait on the dope man) \n\nThe sister here could have so many other things going on other than dope. Could be, like someone else said, Bi-Polar/BPD, another mental health disorder, being In some kind of abusive relationship. Shit, doesn\u2019t even have to be a substance use disorder, could be a gambling/scratch off addiction for all you know. \n\nIt\u2019s just not \u201cnormal\u201d to need $30 like that, instantly.

She\u2019ll pay me tomorrow, but can I borrow 30 bucks til a day or 2 when she does? I need it for my phone bill\u201d \n\nShe only needed 30, why did she accept the $100 from the neighbor?

That fetty-wap. Horse, Charlie, dog-food, down. You get it, sissy\u2019s on dope do sho.", "NTA. Agree with others views. A reasonable pets person would not react that way.

I'm sorry, but your sister is completely out of control, and there's not one thing you can do to make it better with problems of that magnitude.

She sounds unhinged.", "I can't believe this all happened over $30. It's also hard to believe you didn't have another $30 to just give to her and then get the money back from your friend.
