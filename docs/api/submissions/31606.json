I was very poor, and had a hard time, just scraping by for years.  I had to go on the dole to get a surgery when I was in my early 20s.

I don't need the money, but this felt like a massive disrespect. I've never brought up how it makes me feel.\n\nThe other day, I overheard him talking to my stepbrother about some money stuff.

This is completely untrue.  I don't need the money, but it's also a complete lie. At dinner, we had some drinks, and I got him talking about things he's never told me.

I would be extremely hurt too. Also, you sound reasonable about it; I honestly think i would have broken down and gone LC with the parents already.\n\nI'm kind of curious what your parents' financial set up is/was though. I mean, was it a single-income household?", "INFO: Did you ask, \"How am I mistaken.?\"\n\nWhat  you described sounds hurtful and unbalanced support. It would be worth hearing her explanation.", "First, you know what you know and I don't think you're mistaken any more than you do. \n\nSecond, I think you need therapy and to really sort through and come to terms with what they did and didn't do. \n\nThird, I think this a lot more complex than disconnecting. You love your stepbro and his family. You love your mom. But you have deep resentments. My guess is you need to get your mom and stepfather in the same room and ask why you were treated so differently and why you weren't worth more effort/time/money and so on. \n\nNTA", "NTA, like another said, you have resentments and therapy should help with perspective and ultimately making you more present when around your family.  It sounds like your perception and your Mother's is far apart.  I'd say relax.  It's understandable how you feel but it needs to be taken care of.  You want to be on the best terms possible when your parents die.  Trust me on this.", "Info: Where is your biological dad? Is he deceased or are they divorced? Because for your step dad, he may expect your biological dad to contribute to you instead of him.", "Info: You said \u201cthey\u201d have a will. Do you mean your stepdad or your mom? Is it 1/6 of your stepdad\u2019s money or 1/6 of your mom\u2019s with little to no money left to you by your stepdad? \n\nIf it\u2019s your stepdad\u2019s money and your mom passes away first, what would stop him from rewriting his will to exclude you entirely? \n\nNTA, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really about the will. You\u2019ve been treated as less-than for 30 years. That\u2019s the issue. The will was just the last straw. Your stepdad dismisses you/ignores you altogether and your mom has stood passively by, allowing him to treat her only child as a very distant second to his biological offspring. \n\nThey have some serious audacity asking you for money. Tell them if they need anything else to ask your stepbrother since he and his wife make a lot more than you. If they (your mom and stepdad) had enough money to send three kids to private school and pay for their college, they shouldn\u2019t need to borrow money in the first place. \n\nGet your money back immediately and go LC/NC. You can still see your stepbrother and his family without involving your parents, if those relationships important to you. Just lay it all out in detail/with all examples. Hopefully he\u2019ll see where you\u2019re coming from.", "We don\u2019t know enough to say. How much of the estate is a contribution from your mother? It does seem to be strange to get a 16% share. It would make more sense if you got 25%-35% share. Unless there is a big estate, it seems like more of a hassle to get that money. My guess is that if they borrowed money from you, then they are going to have an empty estate.", "NTA the fact your stepbrothers wife is getting the same amount as you are is the real kick in the teeth as she\u2019s no more related to your stepdad than you are. \n\nIt\u2019s also extremely shitty they couldn\u2019t give you the same education. \n\nHowever, I get the feeling your mum didn\u2019t get much choice in any of this and your stepdad has full financial control. \n\nShe definitely should have done more to stand up for you, however that generation of women were often trapped in marriages due to having no money of their own and she may have been afraid of him leaving her with absolutely nothing, and without work experience, she would have nothing to fall back on.", "ESH, it sounds like they have been freer with their aid to your step brother and that sucks. But why exactly do you think that an even split of the will is unfair? That particular point sounds like sour grapes. People aren't obligated to leave everything to their children while ignoring their grandchildren when writing a will. Stick to being annoyed they didn't help you pay for your education like they have him and his grandkids.", "Yes, YTA. you are not his child. He has no obligation to put you in the will at all. He\u2019s being kind by doing so AND giving you an even amount to what he\u2019s giving his actual son, and blood grandchildren. You don\u2019t have any kids. You also aren\u2019t privy to all of their financial information, you don\u2019t know if they do or don\u2019t have the money to pay you back in full rn", "Mostly ESH, I would bet your mom has little say in the way the will was written because your stepdad was the \u201cmoney maker\u201d and like it or not you are not blood to him and it sounds like a blood is thicker than water situation. I am not saying that is right but may be what it is. \n\nSo, maybe try not to ruin the last few years with your mom over money you may or may not ever see.", "Is your step brother\u2019s bio mom deceased?\nIt is possible she made your stepdad promise to take care of their son rather than giving his money to a second family.\nThe other thing to consider is that your mom and step father are very unlikely to die at the same time.\nIf he dies before your mom she can likely change her will to give you more.", "I would tell your Mom to fuck off and not speak to any of them again to be honest.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did you stepdad pay for his son college? I am betting that he did, and he didn't paid for yours right?\n\nYou fell hurt because it just become clear that you are not family. Your SD is responsable for the finances and is suporting your mom. He  didn't spend enough time with you to see himself as your dad, so for him he is leaving his money for his family, and because he loves your mom he is leaving you, the daughter of the woman he loves, a bit of money to help in the future but only that. It is like a token.\n\nYour mom cried because to her you are family but she doesn't have the power to make you hers husband's family and she probably didn't realize that you weren't until you had pointed it out to her. Denail can be a scary thing, and your mom are full of it.", "They're looking at it like they're treating each individual the same. You're looking at his family as a unit and adding up what each are getting and concluding it's more than your share. So it's a difference of perspective. The real issue is the underlying coldness from your stepdad and the way they seem to withhold support from you in ways that make you struggle while nickel and diming you on money they owe", "If the parents divvy money up by family members, time to become a polygamist and marry 7 women to dilute your step bro\u2019s share of the money.", "The problem and the fact is you are sadly nothing to the guy your mom married and she may not have a lot of say in how dude spends his money. Why are you said about grandkids getting inheritance? They are his family why you think you deserve more than them ? Your mom may be in denial.", "She did not work much after they got together, but she did some. It wasn't very necessary.", "I should, you're right.", "He died 4 years ago.  He was poor as well and I supported him financially for the last 15 years of his life.", "Their finances have been collective since before I was an adult and their will is collective.", "Their finances have been collective since they were married.\n\nThe estate will probably be sizeable but that isn't really what this us about for me.  I made my own way and I am ok, but I feel like second class in the family, and its strongest when I'm with them.", "Does it make sense for him and his wife to get double what I do?  Genuine question", "The will is collective.  I do know that they have millions.", "Its not about the money.", "She is being supported by him.  She has dementia.  I doubt that.  He gave her a million dollars when they divorced 35 years ago.", "I love her.  I wouldn't do that.  I dont have many people in life and she is one of them.  I am hurt but I dont want to destroy our relationship.", "He was an analyst on Wall Street in the 70s 80s and 90s and has made money on the stock market since leaving Wallstreet 20 years ago.\n\nShe has been a teacher all her life (and still does it).", "Maybe your mom had no say in it? It would still hurt very much though, as he has been around for like 2/3 of your life. I'm so sorry, OP. It always hurts to be treated as less than by parents.", "Well, they are double the amount of people as you. They're choosing to treat their daughter-in-law as an individual instead of an extension of her husband. I think it's lovely that they decided to acknowledge her as one of their children, deserving of an equal part of the inheritance. She must feel very accepted and valued. I wish my in-laws liked me that much.\n\nAn even split of the will seems fair enough, I think it would be a mistake to focus on that instead of the years of actual mistreatment and inequity. It'll just make it look like you're being greedy about their money instead of getting the real point across that you're tired of feeling 2nd class in your own family.", "It sounds like 1/6 of his estate might be a heck of a lot of money.\nI can absolutely understand why he would want to provide for his grandchildren in addition to his son, daughter in law and step child."]}
