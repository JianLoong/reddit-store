It would be worth hearing her explanation.", "First, you know what you know and I don't think you're mistaken any more than you do. \n\nSecond, I think you need therapy and to really sort through and come to terms with what they did and didn't do. \n\nThird, I think this a lot more complex than disconnecting. You love your stepbro and his family. You love your mom. But you have deep resentments. My guess is you need to get your mom and stepfather in the same room and ask why you were treated so differently and why you weren't worth more effort/time/money and so on. \n\nNTA", "NTA, like another said, you have resentments and therapy should help with perspective and ultimately making you more present when around your family.  It sounds like your perception and your Mother's is far apart.  I'd say relax.  It's understandable how you feel but it needs to be taken care of.

You\u2019ve been treated as less-than for 30 years. That\u2019s the issue. The will was just the last straw. Your stepdad dismisses you/ignores you altogether and your mom has stood passively by, allowing him to treat her only child as a very distant second to his biological offspring. \n\nThey have some serious audacity asking you for money. Tell them if they need anything else to ask your stepbrother since he and his wife make a lot more than you. If they (your mom and stepdad) had enough money to send three kids to private school and pay for their college, they shouldn\u2019t need to borrow money in the first place. \n\nGet your money back immediately and go LC/NC.

My guess is that if they borrowed money from you, then they are going to have an empty estate.", "NTA the fact your stepbrothers wife is getting the same amount as you are is the real kick in the teeth as she\u2019s no more related to your stepdad than you are. \n\nIt\u2019s also extremely shitty they couldn\u2019t give you the same education. \n\nHowever, I get the feeling your mum didn\u2019t get much choice in any of this and your stepdad has full financial control. \n\nShe definitely should have done more to stand up for you, however that generation of women were often trapped in marriages due to having no money of their own and she may have been afraid of him leaving her with absolutely nothing, and without work experience, she would have nothing to fall back on.", "ESH, it sounds like they have been freer with their aid to your step brother and that sucks. But why exactly do you think that an even split of the will is unfair? That particular point sounds like sour grapes. People aren't obligated to leave everything to their children while ignoring their grandchildren when writing a will. Stick to being annoyed they didn't help you pay for your education like they have him and his grandkids.", "Yes, YTA. you are not his child. He has no obligation to put you in the will at all. He\u2019s being kind by doing so AND giving you an even amount to what he\u2019s giving his actual son, and blood grandchildren. You don\u2019t have any kids.

You may not need financial help now, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need emotional or mental support and she still isn\u2019t making a way for you to get that fairly.

You have no idea if there\u2019s a prenup agreement that limits access your mother has to step dad\u2019s money (I am betting so if she\u2019s borrowing money from you) or how their marriage is handled financially.
