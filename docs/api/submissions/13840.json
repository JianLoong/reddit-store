They have had them on sleepovers before. A few months ago(4-6) my brother got a dog. It was 1 year old the breeder had planned to keep, but decided she couldn't. The dog had never met another human before. My brother has no experience with dogs. We met the dogs a couple of times, it seemed very uncomfortable and scared, but not agressive. My wife's family has dogs, and the rules with dogs and kids are firm: Dogs are on leash or an adult can stop the dog at any given time if they interact. \n\nSince we dont know my brothers dog, and don't trust it( in our mind a scared dog is one step away from a biting dog) we required the same rules to be followed. Dog on leash, or adult so close they can stop it. \n\nMy parents showed some pictures from their weekend,  and one was with our son playing with the dog, no leash and no adult. My wife had told them when she delivered the kids that if my brother comes over with the dog, please keep it in leash, as we don't trust it.\n\nWe told them that we didn't want the dog near the kids without the leash, and that was the rules. If that was too hard, they couldn't have the kids. My dad said \"We don't have to listen to this shit\" and left, my mom argued that is was only for the photo, and that they shouldn't have sent it, and won't show them to us in the future. I said that was worse, the rule is no dogs without leash near the kids. She argued that it would be impossible to have my brother and his dog over if we had these rules. And that my relationship with my brother would be impossible to maintain. I said we need an adult to be able to physically stop the dog from reaching the kids at all times. How they reach that goal was up to them. Back and forth, and my mom said that I was making the situation hard for her with my dad and my brother. I said I only care about my kids safety, and their feelings are not a priority. She tried to make up some situations and new rules to make us seem unreasonable.I said that's not what we said, and you know it. You are making an argument and you are well aware and understand our point and rules fully well. She pushed the matter and wanted us to make up some weird rules. We refused. \n\nShe left. \n\n I'm sure the dog seems nice and that my brother feels he can control it,  but this is his first dog, apart from a family dog 20 years ago, he was 8 when it died. I'm not willing to risk it. I'm scared and angry because their first idea was not to follow our safety rules, it was to hide that they broke them. I don't think they respect our rules or us. They just fear the sanctions. So I'm not going to let the kids stay with my parents for the time being. AITA?\n\nI might be the asshole because they felt like they had control, and took precautions,  and love the kids and would not want them hurt. We hurt their feelings by implicitly saying they didn't do a good enough job.", "created_utc": 1680457904, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129sk4t/aita_grandparents_wont_follow_our_rules/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A dog can kill a 2 or 5 year old. You are right to be concerned. If your brother was the dog whisperer fine but he\u2019s not. If they don\u2019t listen to this rule they won\u2019t listen to any others you might come up with in the future.", "NTA. First, your kids, you get a say in how you want to handle their safety. Second, absolutely makes sense that you'd want precautions for them being around a dog you don't know and who seemed uneasy in the past. I don't understand your parents, especially your dad's, casual attitude of \"we don't have to listen to this shit\". If they don't care about your children's safety, they don't get to hang out with your children full stop", "NTA   \nMy nephew was bitten by a dog while he was visiting his grandfather (the dog belonged to his partner's son). The dog suddenly snapped (maybe there were too many people around it and it felt anxious) and in a split second had my nephew's head in his mouth. Thankfully it resulted in \"only\" a scar on the forehead (and a trauma for years to come).  \n   \nYou're right to be worried and careful about your children being next to an unfamiliar dog, and your parents should know to abide by your rules, even if they don't make sense to them.", "You did not hurt their feelings. They managed that all on their own. Never again they are not to be trusted. It\u2019s all about them and not the safety of your children.", "NTA you're prioritising your children's safety.\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable with this dog then 100% it should not be around your kids. It's really simple. Keep the dog on a leash or in another room while your kids are there. Small children and dogs can be a very dangerous mix, even the most patient and well trained dogs have been known to turn nasty.\n\nYou should not have to compromise on keeping your babies safe. Ever. And if your parents and brother can't put their grandchildren/niece and nephew before the dog, you're right to stop them having unsupervised contact.", "NTA to want to protect your children's safety over the ruffled feelings of adults.\n\nThis dog is presumably getting training? This training presumably involves at least some classes with a qualified instructor who can help your brother learn how to safely introduce a fearful dog to different situations in a way that ends up happily for all? Your brother is listening and learning from the trainer just as his dog is learning too?\n\nThe dog is a short term problem with a solution of training. Your parents deciding to ignore and insult your rules will require a lot more training to keep the children safe. Some rule-breaking like two cupcakes instead of just one is livable. Some other rules are less suited for breaking.", "NTA Surely their feelings would be more hurt if anything was to happen on their watch and their grandchildren or the dog were hurt\u203d", "NTA. I love my dog very much and know that she would never hurt a child. However, if someone were to make a (very reasonable imo) request such as yours, I would accept it. It\u2019s not that hard to keep your dog on a leash. The bottom line is that you have to keep your children safe. Your parents and brother should be able to understand that.", "Question. If there was no adult who took the picture?", "NTA! It only takes moments for something to happen and the rules your set where to ensure there would not be an opportunity for anything to happen. They chose not to honor that. They wouldn\u2019t be allowed to have my kids alone again until they could agree to follow the rules.", "NTA and in the past few months we have had several dog attacks when children have been killed. I suggest you find the articles and forward them to your parents", "NTA, and nothing too harsh about it! I've had dogs for many years, all of them trained, all of them socialized, all of them good with kids, but when kids play they run, they scream, and even an otherwise calm, easy-going dog can get too excited. This is a dog you don't trust\u2014it does not seem comfortable with people, acts scared, thus it is potentially a fear-biter. Your children cannot defend themselves and your family is too lax\u2014they don't seem to know how fast a dog can move, how quickly a child can get seriously bitten. They've already said they won't let you know if the let the dog loose with the kids next time, so you know for certain that you cannot trust them. So don't trust them.", "NTA - your parents don\u2019t believe that anything can go wrong, and don\u2019t feel that your rules apply to them.  So when something eventually happens under their care, they will be astonished and say, oops, I didn\u2019t think that would happen.   The problem is that opps doesn\u2019t undo the physical, mental, and emotional damage done to your children.\n\nYour parents and your brother are not responsible dog owners.  They are more concerned about selfies and pictures than the safety and well being of your kids.\n\nCheck the news, there is a Florida grandma who has accidentally killed two of her grandchildren in the last year.  The first one was a 16 month old that she was babysitting.  She fell asleep and the toddler wandered outside and drown in the pond next door.  The grandmother wasn\u2019t charged because there was no history of neglect and it was considered an accident.  Fast forward a year, the mom wanting to give her mother a second chance with her grandchildren, allowed her to take the 7 month old out with friends for lunch.  When the grandmother returned home, she forgot about the baby in the back seat and left him in the care for a few hours in the Florida heat.  When others returned home and asked where the baby was, she remembered that she had left the baby in the car.  She is now being charged with aggravated manslaughter.\n\nSo, do you want to risk the safety and well being of your children?  Everyone\u2019s risk for safety tolerance is different.  That\u2019s fine, some people,skydive, and others don\u2019t.  You are the parents of 2 tender age kids.  You are responsible for keeping them safe from harm.  You and no one else gets to decide what is safe and not safe for your children.  Your parents are treating you like you are still a minor child and not an adult responsible for your own children\u2019s safety.  They believe they are entitled to override their decisions.  To me, this would be unacceptable because they don\u2019t have to live every day with the ramifications of their poor choices, you do.  You would be the person to have to look at your child every day or look at the empty place at the dinner table.\n\nI would strongly suggest that it is not safe for your children to have overnights at your parents house.  They should also not be left unsupervised at your parents house.\n\nPeople learn the behaviors to repeat or avoid by whether they receive a reward or punishment.  Your parents will repeat their bad behavior unless they are punished for it.  No unsupervised visits or overnights is a consequence for them disregarding your rules regarding dogs.", "It's all fun and games until the kid gets mauled. They knew the rule. NTA", "NTA  As you told your mom, your children\u2019s safety is your priority. The \u2018we shouldn\u2019t have told you\u2019 bit is a huge problem. You are the parents, you set the rules", "NTA. If you leave your children alone with your parents again your rules (dog related or not) will be ignored. Even entertaining the thought that your rules will be respected and adhered too is incredibly naive.", "Your parents have no intention of respecting the limits you set. They're going to do what they want, and if your kids get bitten, tough kazabies.\n\nDO NOT LET THESE PEOPLE TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR CHILDREN. They are self-righteous, snarling villains who have no idea what they're doing but insist on doing it anyway.\n\nIf something bad happens, it's more your fault than theirs. And why do your kids have to stay over at your parents' in the first place? That line from your father that you quoted really sums up their attitude.", "INFO: wasn\u2019t there an adult standing right there taking the photo? How does that not follow your rule?", "This is a difficult one as I kind of agree with both sides. \n\nYou gave them rules and if they agreed to them the I would come down on the NTA side. You stipulated rules and if they agreed they should have honoured them. And there is absolutely no justification for them not complying with your wishes and them lying to you about it (as was implied)\n\nThat being said I would say that in my opinion you are maybe being a little over protective. If they were in the room with your kids and the dog (the kids alone with the dog is a whole other scenario) then I would argue they were on hand to step in if there anything happened, and that may be their stand point. \n\nI would suggest that the person who is best to deal with the situation is actually your brother the dog owner. I have kept dogs my whole life and I would never let a dog that was new around kids untill I was sure of his temperament.", "NTA but you would be if you ever left your kids with your parents again", "YTA. I understand but grand parent let the kids do whatever they want to do, then send them back home. I really don't see the big deal. Nothing happened.....", "\"We met the dogs a couple of times, it seemed very uncomfortable and scared, but not agressive.\"  Dogs can pick up on emotions, perhaps it sensed you were uncomfortable and mirrored your emotions. In other words, the dog knows you don't like it. \n\nI can't tell if you're YTA or not because I know nothing about this dog. What breed is it? What size is it? Male or female? As for the picture, all I know it has a kid and the dog. I have no clue how the two were interacting. The only I can say is you don't like dogs.", "nta in this case but You don\u2019t sound friendly", "I feel like you\u2019re Nta however they obviously love your child and wouldn\u2019t let anything hurt them. I understand you stated you wanted the dog On a leash which I totally understand but it seems there was plenty of people watching the dog and the child too", "NTA. I know several families who have had family pets that grew up with the kids that have turned on a child and bit them suddenly. 2 were in the face. And another family that got a rescue dog that attacked a visitor. You are right. It sucks that your family doesn't listen to you - in your place I would not trust them alone with my kds anymore.", "NTA - and I say that as both a parent and dog owner. My own dogs are very very sweet and I would never expect them to hurt my child, but I don\u2019t let my kid near my dogs unless myself or my husband are right there. Kids that young are unpredictable. They don\u2019t know how to communicate with dogs and dogs don\u2019t know how to communicate with them. \n\nMy child\u2019s safety is not worth them looking \u201ccute\u201d with my dogs. Anyone who didn\u2019t respect those boundaries wouldn\u2019t be watching my kid. You can bet that until my kid is old enough that I\u2019m not worried, I\u2019m gonna be close enough to take any potential dog bites. Do I Expect to be in that situation? No, not at all. But I\u2019m not betting my child\u2019s life on it.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey broke your trust. NEVER let them have unsupervised time with your kids ever again. You can not trust them.", "NTA. Simple question \"Mother, what is more important to you? Seeing your one child's *dog*? Or seeing your other child's *children*?\"\n\nThey do not seem to understand the importance of your rules for your children. Or the just do not care. But mostly the latter.\n\nGood luck.", "YTA for being such a drama queen about it, guess what if your own parents did not respect your rules in the strict rigid manner you want to, nobody else will (kindergarden, other parents, school etc). Don't alienate your parents over a technicality, you need to accept that you will never be able to have absolute control over the behavior of people who interact with your children, the most you can hope for is that people try to respect your rules best way they can. So either you isolate your own children against people who do not follow your rules to the point, as you plan on doing re their own grandparents, or try to find the middle ground. Truth be told, in this particular case, even if your parents kept your rules to the letter, it would still not be enough to eliminate the danger, since very few adults can actually stop a rampaging dog in a heartbeat, let alone grandma and grandpa. \nTry to be less rigid, no rule you ever set will ever be followed to the letter, and the ones who will break your rules the most will be your own kids.", "ESH . \n\nYour parents - for not following clear rules you and your wife set.\n\nYou - Have full right to set the rules around your kids. They are your kids, period. Especially since you and wife agree (I would say the rules are really weird. Not sure what kind of dogs your wife had to end up like that, But those are your rules), YTA for saying \" I said I only care about my kids safety, and their feelings are not a priority.\"  This is softer YTA than for your parents but this statement has no reason but to hurt them...", "NTA. Between their lack of good judgement and disdain for your rules, they aren't safe for your children regardless of the dog. It's not worth the risk.", ">Never again.\n\nWas this supposed to be an argument **for** allowing the kids to visit? \"Don't worry, OP, the next time we do something with your kids that you expressly told us not to, we'll do a better job hiding it.\"", "Exactly! And we know that even the real Dog Whisperer would NEVER put little kids with a dog that was uncertain around people.", "The photo was taken from approx 10 ft away, and the kid and dog were less than 1 foot away. They would not in any way be able to catch the dog before it could bite", "Cameras can take photos from several meters away. There are even pictures of the moon nowadays.", "Thank you for your honesty. I would just point out this: IMO, an inexperienced dog owner is not always capable of making such a judgement. \n\nAgree that the rules are strict. They are, however, the rules. They are partly in place because I know I would NEVER forgive any of them if the dog did bite. No matter the outcome.", "\u2018They were on hand to step in if anything happened \u2018 - like the dog biting the baby for example?  Sure, they could deal with the situation by tending the wounds and calling medical help if necessary, but OP feels that isn\u2019t good enough and would prefer baby not to be in that situation", "I actually like dogs, but I consider them animals, not human fur babies. They should be treated like dogs because that's best for them, IMO. I took classes and trained the old family dog, and I learned how much work it is and how they are not humans. When you're not doing that, I don't trust your dog around my kids. The dog is some collie mix, female. \n\nThe dog was chasing a ball the kid was throwing in the air.", "Yes, but seeing a kid get bitten by a dog isn't helping. You need to be able to stop it. I don't think everyone understands how fast a dog can flip. Especially around kids.", "I'm glad someone thinks that. I disagree with everything you say, but it means that I got both sides somewhat across and that you and my parents share that view. That's fine by me.", "Mom put her feelings up against her grandchildren\u2019s safety, that\u2019s on her", "I don't know, I think OP's kid's safety trumps OP's parents feelings; especially for a dog they don't know/are uncomfortable with. I wouldn't compromise on my kid's safety just so my parents wouldn't have their feelings hurt (or whatever their issue seems to be, honestly they sound a bit lazy like they can't be bothered to have the dog on a leash)", "I think in this moment it was necessary for op mom was bringing in their feelings on them not following the rule. If she didn\u2019t bring her feelings in to then I would agree. However op is right your child safety is always a priority over anyone feelings.", "Did you specify with the grandparents exactly how close you considered to be close enough?", "YTA. Make new rules, or explain the ones you made, but you're the one turning this into a drama after the fact. If the new rule is \"always leashed and leash held by adult\", then state that.", "I would agree with you on both counts. \n\nI would suggest discussing it with your brother not your folks. Explain your concerns with him as it is his dog and he should be the one in control of it. I would get him to agree to the terms and then it takes your parents out of the equation all together.\n\nFundamentally it is your decision. If they cannot comply with your wishes then they only get to see the kids when the dog is not there. They will be limiting their time with their grandkids. Irrespective of if I agree with your decision regarding dogs if you were to come to my house I would respect and abide by it. We keep a series of baby gates stored away for that very purpose, so we can segregate little people from the dog if we feel it is appropriate or if it is requested of us. Ultimately it is part of being a responsible dog owner.\n\nThere is never an excuse for them not complying with your wishes behind your back.", "I agree it it's the op's opinion that matters and that his parents should respect his decision. \n\nI was merely stating an alternative point of view. Many people would feel comfortable in the situation described, adults in the room at the same time as the dog and the children. \n\nBut ultimately my the ops parents agreed to his conditions and should have complied with them", "I got bitten by a collie. Not too badly but it took me twenty years to get over my dog phobia.", "Yeah I do agree with that. Have you told your parents how you feel?", "I agree with you on child safety (As a person who have been around dogs all their life, I do think the rule is crazy - but it is their choice). My soft YTA was for unnecessary rudeness.  there was nothing to gain by it...", "I agree with \"child safety is always a priority over anyone feelings\". There are different way to say it.", "Yes, the rule is simple: You must, at all times, be able to physically stop the dog from reaching the child in case it gets aggressive or the child is scared.", "It's not a new rule. It was, and has always been the rule, since my kids were born. They are aware.", "If the grandparents are wanting to be the ones trusted with the children, why would op need to work around them with his brother? How does that help the problem of the grandparents disregarding the parent\u2019s rules? They have violated op\u2019s trust. I live with my daughter and granddaughter, and would NEVER disregard my daughter\u2019s rules. There is no excuse for this.", "The only kinder way to say it is. \u201cMy children safety is my main priority\u201d. However op mom probably would have said they make a priority too but..", "From your post: \n\n> the rules with dogs and kids are firm: Dogs are on leash **or an adult can stop the dog**\n\nWhether an adult is close enough to stop the dog is a matter of opinion. You don't know how far the camera holder is, or who might be standing out of frame. Like I said, if you want to enforce the leash rule, that's fine. Take away the option of \"an adult can stop the dog\".  \n\nBut don't give people a choice, then tell them that one choice is always wrong, after the fact.", "This is my thinking also. It doesn\u2019t really matter what the rule is, what matters is that the grandparents ignored the rule, said that they don\u2019t have to listen to \u201cthis s\u2026\u201d (AKA- The rule) and then stated that, in future rule breaking, the children\u2019s parents will just not be told about said rule breaking which, given the ages of the children, will involve some kind of \u201cShhhh this is our little secret\u201d type thing which is a whole different level of dangerous!", "I was just offering a potential solution to the op as a resolution to the dog situation that didn't involve a confrontation.\n\nI agree with you whole heartedly that the underlying issue of the parents not complying with the ops wishes is a massive breach of trust and would need to be resolved as well.", "Agreed! I went through something similar and it ended up in a confrontation. I was fortunate in my situation as the other party who 'didnt think it was a big deal' sat down and actually discussed it with me. In the end they began to see it from my side and suddenly realised how much of a betrayal it was.", "The breach of trust IS the issue, period. Suggesting a workaround for the dog merely lets the grandparents off the hook, and would be tantamount to telling them they don\u2019t have to abide op\u2019s rules for his children. It doesn\u2019t solve anything, and actually makes things worse. If you have to work around someone who is supposed to be trusted with your child, why would you EVER trust them? Do you believe there will never be another dog around, even? I seriously don\u2019t understand how you think that suggestion helps at all.", "It must job be my approach to solving problems. I tend to split them down into bits and see if there are any 'easy wins'. \n\nI didn't mean to imply it was a solution to the whole situation and there are fundamental things here that need resolution I was mearly suggesting that it might be a potential avenue for conversation."]}
