I adored this kitten, he was like my best friend, followed me everywhere I went and always slept on my pillow next to my face. \n\nMy mom has this friend that lives two streets over, she and her daughter comes over a lot. The girl has autism, but that\u2019s irrelevant why I don\u2019t like her. Now back to my cat, when the temps are cool at night we open our back doors which leads to a big screened in patio. O\u2019Malley (the cat) loved that room, it was his outdoorsy time to get fresh air. \n\nLate one evening, O\u2019Malley vanished. We were baffled, there were no holes in the screen, nowhere he could have gotten out. Regardless, we spent weeks looking for him. I completely broke down one day, realizing he\u2019s gone forever. I felt like I mourned him. \n\nFast forward a few months, my dad and I are coming home one evening. We drove past a lost cat sign and both of us freaked. It looked SO much like Thomas O\u2019Malley, just a bit older version of him. My dad wrote the number down, thinking maybe he\u2019d call. Out of curiosity he looks up the number to find out, it\u2019s the friend of my mother that lives two streets over!!\n\nMy dad and I decided to go start looking for him again. Nothing, then a few nights later I hear a faint meow coming from the backyard. IT WAS O\u2019MALLEY! I was so happy I was crying, he was so happy he was vibrating because he was purring so loud. I thought it was a happy ending, I had my best buddy back that I never thought I\u2019d see again. I so missed him, he went right back to sleeping on my pillow with me. \n\nThat was until my mother decided to allow the mother cat thief and her demon spawn into our house. Thomas O\u2019Malley saw them and ran off. I went after him, took him in my room and barricaded us in there. An argument pursued, then it stoped. My mom came to my door and said we have to give him back. NOPE, ain\u2019t no way in hell. I was prepared to find out if Amazon could drone deliver us food to my window before I ever open that door again. \n\nCat nappers called the cops. My dad produced adoption paperwork with his microchip that is still registered to us. They produced recent pics of O\u2019Malley with vet records. The cop said it\u2019s a civil matter, take it to the courthouse. \n\nThey\u2019re claiming O\u2019Malley is the autistic girl\u2019s ESA, and that they found him in the woods. Lies. My mom does not want this escalating to the court and says I need to give O\u2019Malley back. She said I need to consider the girl\u2019s disability and the fact they had O\u2019Malley longer than I did (barely). Like let\u2019s just ignore the fact THEY STOLE HIM. My dad says it\u2019s my decision and he\u2019ll support me in whatever I decide but then also said behind mother\u2019s back to \u2018eff them people.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to give him back, it\u2019s not fair, he is my cat.

Registration is automatic with purchase with a lot of chips nowadays, but definitely not all.", "She knew, that's why she's trying to do damage control and get OP to de-escalate on taking it to court because she's got something to lose in this.", "I got this vibe too. Why is she defending them?", "Man, c'mon, this is clearly a reasonably young kid given how they write. You have absolutely no idea if the Mum is in cahoots and this kid is going to be extremely impressionable to stuff posted on here. Why do half the people on here need to jump to ridiculous worst case scenarios all the time", "You don\u2019t know these people. Why are you throwing around crazy accusations?", "This is the thing - it's chipped. Ownership is not in doubt.", "This all the way. The vet should have checked. Clearly the family said that they adopted the cat or it was given to them.", "But, it's pretty obvious the OPs mom is in on it. So, vet calls, talks to the mom, mom says they gave the cat to the neighbor, end of story. Vet would have no reason to question the story, especially if it's not the OPs vet.", "I\u2019m also thinking that your mom is also at fault if she went to her friends\u2019 house during the time they had O\u2019Malley. If she went there, she most likely saw him. Especially if your cat knows her well.", "100%.\n\nAn asshole with a disability is still an asshole.", "They could of easily said it was given to them by a friend and the vet may not have scanned.", "Get a AirTag and put it on him asap", "Grab him on their way out of the house and stick him in a purse. It's a kitten.", "I guess it might depend on the law school, but tbh I can\u2019t imagine a clinic helping someone with this unimportant of an issue. Clinics at my school helped people with custody issues, clemency, and (at the very least) non-criminal municipal issues.", "To be fair, I think all cats are. The one of mine who investigates generally hates everyone and with smack anyone who tries to pet her. I've had her and the hidey boy basically their whole lives, and the friendly dude we found on the street abandoned.\n\nThese animals are hilarious. I bet yours are amazing though.", "If OP stays cat has to be locked in his room with no access for mum while he's out... I wouldn't trust her after that statement even if she wasn't involved in the catnap.", "I agree that they should. I've actually never seen it happen, though. They ask for the microchip number but don't verify it. It's actually pretty bad.", "Never seen this happen either and I have moved so many times in the past three years that my dog has seen so many vets and neither of them have ever checked her microchip that I know of", "Ah, I misread that as op producing vet records. \n\nMicrochips have to be scanned with a special device, which can then read the data on it (edit ie the owner's name, number, address, etc). They can't live track your cat, it relies on somebody actually deciding to check for it. also, not every scanner works with every brand of chip or they can get moved out of place, so even if the vet did scan the cat it might not guarantee a chip reading.", "We have a gps collar and the app sends a text when the pet is out of the boundaries it can differentiate between the house and the yard, it\u2019s that exact.\nIt does have a small yearly service fee. \nMy only thought would be if the thieves take the collar off it would be for nothing.", "I don\u2019t think vets just randomly check for a microchip. If they didn\u2019t tell the vet it was a cat they found somewhere, the vet would have no reason to check.", "No - I do think the family lied and said that they were given the cat or adopted the cat. The vet didn\u2019t have a reason to check", "Have you asked your mother how she can remain friends with someone who KNEW you\u2019d lost your cat and then KEPT the \u201clost\u201d cat??  I really want to know if she has changed her tune by now.", "the cat is microchipped to OP", "OP said he disappeared late one evening and didn\u2019t say that the family was over so I didn\u2019t think of that.", "The really shy one we call baby because she\u2019s still the size of like a 6 month old kitten. She just stopped growing one day and we were concerned at first but the vet said she was okay \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That's such a horrific betrayal from your father.  I don't know that I could ever forgive him for that in your place.", "Sorry but your dad's an asshole for that. I don't even give my son's toys away without asking him if he's okay with it first.", "That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying the family lied and said they adopted or were given the cat. No way they told the vet that they \u201cfound kitty.\u201d The vet would have checked if the people told the truth on how they found the cat.", "Sometimes the microchips can move or drift too so they're not in the usual places. At least that happened with one of our dogs when I was younger, the chip went down his leg and you'd never know where to look for it unless you already knew.", "Judge Judy would take one look at this case and tell the thieves to fuck all the way off", "I wonder if OP's mother realizes the legit damage she is causing between OP and possibly the dad.", "At least OP knows which house to burn down.", "That didn't prevent the neighbors from stealing the cat, and taking it to a vet, who did not check it for microchip. An air tag helps you locate the cat If it's missing and still wearing the collar.\n\nAn air tag is a good way to find a lost pet, but probably not a stolen pet since one of the first things they'll do is simply take the collar off and dump the collar along with the air tag.\n\nI would alert the vet's office that they took the cat to that they do not own the cat, and provide the microchip number and adoption papers. I don't know if that would do any good, but I would still do it anyways.", "Why wouldn't the vet check if the cat was microchipped? Unless like someone else said the mother is in on it. OP is NTA, but her mom sure as fuck is TA. I'm speculating, but it sounds like OP wanted the cat, the mom was reluctant, they get the cat, and the mom conspires with the neighbor to give them the cat.", "A microchip is only useful if the cat is taken to a shelter or if the neighbors mention it's a stray while at the vet. Most vets won't check for a microchip cause it's assumed the owner is the one bringing the animal in for a check-up. If the neighbors get a hold of the cat again, they could also change the information on the microchip to register in their name instead of OP's, which would not help OP's court case if it goes that far.", "Exactly. Make it clear that she has a choice; her own child, or her friend that's going to keep taking and taking and taking. What's to stop them from stealing more from the house next time, purely because the daughter wants something? \n\nNot just that, but if you find out she had a hand in the original catnapping, or if she gives them the cat again when you and your dad are out of the house, that after you get the cat back, by breaking down doors if need be, that she is dead to you, and you'll make sure everyone knows what she did. To a mom like that, reputation is everything. Make it clear that will be ruined. She let you mourn and suffer for MONTHS while knowing where the cat was, preferring to let her own child, the one she is ACTUALLY responsible for, suffer so her friend can be happy. \n\nThe fact O'Malley FLED to your room to hide the second he even HEARD them screams volumes of the likely abuse he went through at that home. \n\nThen again, I'm the sort to go full nuclear, so hefty handful of salt and all.", "But, if the OPs mom is in on it, all she has to say to the vet is that they gave the cat to the neighbor.", "I doubt that vets do random microchip checks.\n\nIf they took the kitten in to vet appointment saying here's our new cat, likely the vet would take that as truth.\n\nOnly if it showed up at a shelter or someone said, \"We found this lost cat\" would they check.", "I work at a vets office and this is why we scan EVERY new pet we see- even if we have seen the client before. Lo and behold we\u2019ve found two or three \u201cfound\u201d cats that the family was going to keep, only to turn out they\u2019d been reported missing by another family. Honestly all vets should screen all pets unless it\u2019s an established patient.", "That could happen, but then Mom would have to leave a documented trail of betrayal beyond just conspiring with the neighbors.", "Unfortunately this is true to an extent. Unless we have a suspicion that the animal is stolen or we have seen it before, we're probably not gonna scan it. However if they want a microchip implanted, there's a good chance that it would then be found when we go to scan the cat. If they mentioned finding it and it was fixed, I would be more likely to scan it but if they say \"we got him from a neighborhood/friend/family\" the odds of scanning goes down.", "I work at the vet. \n\nWe don't randomly check microchips. \n\nAnd unfortunately, microchips are fuzzy proof of ownership... Like it proves that you paid for a piece of identification. Which is about as useful as putting a serial number on a chair and hoping the police are willing to put the effort into finding the chair thief (they aren't). And once new vet bills come into play, it gets even fuzzier. \n\nThe best way to prove ownership is to pay registration fees annually. I personally think the system is stupid, but the government wants its money any way it can get it.", "Not really. Vet calls, says is this your cat? Op's mom says they couldn't keep it and gave it to the neighbor. End of story.", "I just got my kitten spayed/**microchipped**, and two vaccines.  \n\nNot something we did when I was a kid(or even when I got my late calico in 2007) but now I consider it a must."]}
