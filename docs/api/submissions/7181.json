I adored this kitten, he was like my best friend, followed me everywhere I went and always slept on my pillow next to my face. \n\nMy mom has this friend that lives two streets over, she and her daughter comes over a lot. The girl has autism, but that\u2019s irrelevant why I don\u2019t like her. Now back to my cat, when the temps are cool at night we open our back doors which leads to a big screened in patio. O\u2019Malley (the cat) loved that room, it was his outdoorsy time to get fresh air. \n\nLate one evening, O\u2019Malley vanished. We were baffled, there were no holes in the screen, nowhere he could have gotten out. Regardless, we spent weeks looking for him. I completely broke down one day, realizing he\u2019s gone forever. I felt like I mourned him. \n\nFast forward a few months, my dad and I are coming home one evening. We drove past a lost cat sign and both of us freaked. It looked SO much like Thomas O\u2019Malley, just a bit older version of him. My dad wrote the number down, thinking maybe he\u2019d call. Out of curiosity he looks up the number to find out, it\u2019s the friend of my mother that lives two streets over!!\n\nMy dad and I decided to go start looking for him again. Nothing, then a few nights later I hear a faint meow coming from the backyard. IT WAS O\u2019MALLEY! I was so happy I was crying, he was so happy he was vibrating because he was purring so loud. I thought it was a happy ending, I had my best buddy back that I never thought I\u2019d see again. I so missed him, he went right back to sleeping on my pillow with me. \n\nThat was until my mother decided to allow the mother cat thief and her demon spawn into our house. Thomas O\u2019Malley saw them and ran off. I went after him, took him in my room and barricaded us in there. An argument pursued, then it stoped. My mom came to my door and said we have to give him back. NOPE, ain\u2019t no way in hell. I was prepared to find out if Amazon could drone deliver us food to my window before I ever open that door again. \n\nCat nappers called the cops. My dad produced adoption paperwork with his microchip that is still registered to us. They produced recent pics of O\u2019Malley with vet records. The cop said it\u2019s a civil matter, take it to the courthouse. \n\nThey\u2019re claiming O\u2019Malley is the autistic girl\u2019s ESA, and that they found him in the woods. Lies. My mom does not want this escalating to the court and says I need to give O\u2019Malley back. She said I need to consider the girl\u2019s disability and the fact they had O\u2019Malley longer than I did (barely). Like let\u2019s just ignore the fact THEY STOLE HIM. My dad says it\u2019s my decision and he\u2019ll support me in whatever I decide but then also said behind mother\u2019s back to \u2018eff them people.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to give him back, it\u2019s not fair, he is my cat.

Autism is not an excuse for theft or kidnapping.", "Sounds like a enabler to me.:", "Isn't there a clip from one of those judge shows where the dog does exactly this?", "*But my kids autistic and she wants it so that\u2019s all that matters!/s*\n\nMan it really grates me when people use their child\u2019s autism as a get out of jail free card.\n\nIt\u2019s just so messed up on so many levels.", "Honestly I\u2019d go to your mother and tell her, in no uncertain terms, that if she gives the cat back to those thieves you will never forgive her.

Especially when they knew it was **your** cat and stole it anyway. Ask her straight up if she gave them **your** cat. Plus, the cat clearly hates them!\n\nMake it clear to your mom, with your dad present, that if the cat disappears again, you will not be letting it go, and your relationship with your mother will be permanently damaged (or is already, if your mom fessed up when you asked). Seriously, your mom is failing you right now just because she wants to avoid more conflict rather than look out for your best interest (and your cat's).\n\n> She said I need to consider the girl\u2019s disability and the fact they had O\u2019Malley longer than I did (barely).\n\nHer disability is no excuse for knowingly stealing something.

Then didn't expect them to have a reason to.", "Or mom's friend didn't know that mom was giving her the cat in secret, so didn't know better than to put up posters. It would make mom the amazingly stupid one, but either option is equally possible I think. Maybe OP and her father never visit the friend's home and so mom thought they'd never figure it out.\n\n(in all honesty though in this conspiracy, I'm leaning more toward mom's friend thinking that the cat was gone long enough and the posters were far enough away that OP's family wouldn't pick up on it)", "Dude, people do fucked up shit for reasons we can\u2019t understand.", "Yeah, they'd be incredibly stupid pet burglars to take a cat they absolutely knew to be someone else's to the vet.", "My screened in patio doesn\u2019t have locks on the doors.

They aren't exactly a scam but they def do not offer the legal services the people who sell it claim. But they don't take action against those sellers either. It's essentially MLM legal services. Check Wikipedia.\n\nOn top of that the lawyers who work at these firms who PPL contract with per state are often overworked, underpaid and frankly, bottom the barrel legal talent. There's a reason they're not working traditionally and it's not because they're fired up to provide low cost legal advice to the general public. That's not 100% across the board but you're rolling the dice on quality.\n\nIf you need scary collection letters on legal masthead as a business owner and don't want to pay a retainer, pre-paid legal is worth the cost.

I\u2019m autistic. My mom never liked pets and frankly wasn\u2019t a good parent either. But my cats meant everything to me growing up. And as much as my mom didn\u2019t care for the cats or want much to do with them she also was the one who would take me and the cat to the vet if necessary since she also didn\u2019t want to watch an animal suffer or be treated cruelly (my dad who does love animals has a weird thing around vet care that is super upsetting). \n\nThere\u2019s lots of studies on autistic folks and animals. They can be a huge benefit for us and a lot of us find animals easier to read and understand. But autistic kids are no different from neurotypical kids in the sense that they still need parents and guidance and to be taught how to behave around animals.\n\nAnd my gosh, if OPs mom did give away the cat. I am sitting here stunned by that too because as effed up of a mom as I have, quick example- I\u2019m also severely physically disabled and currently homeless. My mother would never visit me in a hospital and isn\u2019t helping me now or even facing the reality of my situation. (Though insanely she has repeatedly offered to take my cat in but not me. That one threw me for a loop) And even then, my mom would never want to harm an animal or give away one of the family pets. \n\nThere\u2019s so much bad parenting and bad choices going on here.

You could call and inquire. They might remember the mom acting sus if they mentioned scanning for a chip. \n\nBut regardless, your mom is dead wrong. Your kitty ran like hell when they came in... and he found his way HOME TO YOU! Your dad needs to back you up to your mom's face, too.  That kitty is too young for such a responsibility; the kid might be squeezing him too hard or something... there's a reason he freaked out when he saw them. \n\nI feel for the mom (sort of) but the safety of the animal must be ensured.

Besides the fact that he loves YOU. \n\nSpeaking of stuffed animals, my autistic niece is 6; they have dogs, which is fine, but she hasn't really bonded with them, never hurts them but is just not interested.
