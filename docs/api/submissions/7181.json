I adored this kitten, he was like my best friend, followed me everywhere I went and always slept on my pillow next to my face. \n\nMy mom has this friend that lives two streets over, she and her daughter comes over a lot. The girl has autism, but that\u2019s irrelevant why I don\u2019t like her. Now back to my cat, when the temps are cool at night we open our back doors which leads to a big screened in patio. O\u2019Malley (the cat) loved that room, it was his outdoorsy time to get fresh air. \n\nLate one evening, O\u2019Malley vanished. We were baffled, there were no holes in the screen, nowhere he could have gotten out. Regardless, we spent weeks looking for him. I completely broke down one day, realizing he\u2019s gone forever. I felt like I mourned him. \n\nFast forward a few months, my dad and I are coming home one evening. We drove past a lost cat sign and both of us freaked. It looked SO much like Thomas O\u2019Malley, just a bit older version of him. My dad wrote the number down, thinking maybe he\u2019d call. Out of curiosity he looks up the number to find out, it\u2019s the friend of my mother that lives two streets over!!\n\nMy dad and I decided to go start looking for him again. Nothing, then a few nights later I hear a faint meow coming from the backyard. IT WAS O\u2019MALLEY! I was so happy I was crying, he was so happy he was vibrating because he was purring so loud. I thought it was a happy ending, I had my best buddy back that I never thought I\u2019d see again. I so missed him, he went right back to sleeping on my pillow with me. \n\nThat was until my mother decided to allow the mother cat thief and her demon spawn into our house. Thomas O\u2019Malley saw them and ran off. I went after him, took him in my room and barricaded us in there. An argument pursued, then it stoped. My mom came to my door and said we have to give him back. NOPE, ain\u2019t no way in hell. I was prepared to find out if Amazon could drone deliver us food to my window before I ever open that door again. \n\nCat nappers called the cops. My dad produced adoption paperwork with his microchip that is still registered to us. They produced recent pics of O\u2019Malley with vet records. The cop said it\u2019s a civil matter, take it to the courthouse. \n\nThey\u2019re claiming O\u2019Malley is the autistic girl\u2019s ESA, and that they found him in the woods. Lies. My mom does not want this escalating to the court and says I need to give O\u2019Malley back. She said I need to consider the girl\u2019s disability and the fact they had O\u2019Malley longer than I did (barely). Like let\u2019s just ignore the fact THEY STOLE HIM. My dad says it\u2019s my decision and he\u2019ll support me in whatever I decide but then also said behind mother\u2019s back to \u2018eff them people.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to give him back, it\u2019s not fair, he is my cat.

By law, they may have been required to try to look for the prior owner before keeping the cat. Obviously they didn\u2019t, because even a microchip check would have led them to you. They did not make a reasonable effort to locate you - the owner.
