After I told him he said I was an ass and took off after Amber.\n\nMy brother called me that night saying I needed to apologize and take back what I said, but I refused to. \n\nMy kids hardly know/spend time with her, and she\u2019s not very well liked amongst our family.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1671526869, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqjjrp/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_new_fianc\u00e9_she_isnt/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The way you handle it was inappropriate. She will be your family by  marriage, therefor she will be there aunt by marriage. \n\nAlso Amber sucks she needs to know what her place is. The statement she made about your mother and brother is a big no-go. But you talked to your brother not to Amber. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it would have changed anything, but  perhaps it would have.", "YTA in this particular situation, even if she sucks in general. She's your brother's life partner, so she's your children's aunt. She can be a distant aunt, a hated aunt, a practical stranger, whatever. You get to choose how much she sees your kids, but not her position on the family tree.", "YTA. You may not like her as a person, but she WILL be their aunt. You're just being a dick for the sake of it.", "YTA. You can dislike her and keep her away from your kids all you want, but she will in fact be their aunt.", "ESH- she seems massively overbearing and aggressively impolite. You on the other hand used your children\u2019s familial affection as a weapon -that\u2019s tacky. Unless you are equally insistent that your other brother\u2019s wife/ex wife/partner/whomever is also not your children\u2019s aunt, you\u2019re also a hypocrite. \n\nFinally, the title of \u201caunt\u201d will eventually be up to your children and the relationship they cultivate with her (if any). I have biological aunts and uncles whom I refer to solely by their names, and others I refer to as auntie/aunt name/uncle name irrespective of blood or current marriage. My mom still refers to her matrilineal uncle\u2019s first wife as Aunt Her name - and she and my great-uncle divorced over 50 years ago. You can limit your children\u2019s exposure to the person, but they will be the ones to determine the worth of whatever that relationship becomes.", "YTA \n\nI have a hunch Amber isn't as awful as you're portraying her. But regardless, by definition she will be their aunt. And if you can't have a good relationship with her, it's awful of you to try to sabotage your kids' relationship with her.", "NTA. She sounds awful. She's your brother's problem, not yours.", "NTA u don\u2019t have to consider her family sometimes even blood doesn\u2019t mean much it\u2019s really ur call", "NTA", "YTA.  And you are your own worst enemy.  If you don't want your kids to be close to her, you are going about it wrong.  Kids tend to respond to apathy more than anything else.  If they sense you are trying (like \"Amber\" is) they will keep their distance, naturally.", "YTA\n\nTechnically she will be their Aunt! That\u2019s how Aunts and Uncles happen. They marry your brothers and sisters. \n\nYou may not like her, but if you want a relationship with your brother you have to learn to tolerate her\n\nSet boundaries on her touching your stuff. But she will be your kids Aunt!", "NTA, when or if the marriage happens then you can title yourself,  but until then, you just have a girlfriend.", "YTA. She will be their aunt. Most of this post is you describing why you don\u2019t like her, but that doesn\u2019t make it okay to embarass her like that. She sounds a bit rude but it doesn\u2019t sound too bad. Just support your brother and be civil to her. It\u2019s not your place.", "ESH. You all should set Amber some boundaries, like \"please don't move my stuff\", \"in this family we ask before using somebody else's things\", \"in this family we don't play favorites\" etc. \n\nBut she is part of your family, you shouldn't try to deny it.", "YTA. There was no need for you to be so aggressive and hostile to her.", "NTA\nAmber is an entitled control freak. If she moved something in my house she wouldn't be welcome back again and if she DARED to touch my personal items she would be all kinds of sorry.", "YTA. Just because you don't care for her behavior doesn't change the fact that she WILL be your children's Aunt when your brother marries her. \n\nBy calling her our publicly, you are demeaning and alienating her in a way that could drive a wedge between you and your brother, who seems to really like her. \n\nUnless you're prepared to lose him too, I would get on board, at least when they are around. Fake it till you make it.", "ESH. A lot. You might not like it but she WILL be your kids aunt by marriage if they do tie the knot and the way you handled that situation was a dick move. If your kids don\u2019t see her much what difference does it make? She\u2019s an AH for pretty much everything else she\u2019s done/said, time for everyone to start calling her out on her rude and disrespectful behaviour and maybe your brother will see her for what she really is", "YTA. We all got weird ass aunts and uncles, but that doesn't mean they're not aunts and uncles.", "ESH - Amber needs boundaries, no doubt. Has anyone outright told her to quit her BS?\n\nYou, however... she isn't their aunt yet, but she legally will be and YTA for denying it.", "NTA, you get to pick who your kids are around, and sounds like you made the right call but maybe you could have communicated that a little better instead of publicly in front of people. Can't fault her for thinking she's going to be their aunt though.", "Yta for the comment. If they marry she will be their aunt. But that rude and disrespectful woman is the AH for everything else you described here. Since you let it be known you don\u2019t like her why not start calling her out on stuff. Just keep in mind she will probably try to alienate your brother from you guys but how is he gonna let her act like this?", "YTA. She sounds insufferable, but she IS marrying your brother and will legally be their aunt. At least in this situation she sounded like she was being nice to the kids.\n\nPlus, your brother has made it clear he loves her and alienating her is just going to cause awkward rifts in your family.", "**YTA**  As upsetting as you find the reality, she will be your kid's aunt.   The issue I would have objected to there would be \"favourite\", you could have simply said that family doesn't have favourites or something similar.   That's what I suggest you talk about in your apology (which you do owe her).    Amber may be every bit as bad as you claim but you chose the wrong hill for a fight.   Clear this up now, you are going to have many other opportunities to squabble with here.", "YTA.\n\nYou can't choose family. And if your brother is married to her is she in fact part of said family. \nWhat you can choose is the amount of time you are willing to spend with her.\n\nAnd you should put her in her place when she just moves stuff around. Kick/call her out. Show her the boundaries.", "YTA! Your Family has picked her as target to pick on! You don\u2019t like her and is looking for a reason to insult her. But using a small kid to insult your brother\u2018s fianc\u00e9 is a low blow! Accept it or not she is a family now as long as she is engaged or married.", "YTA. Whether you like it or not she will be their aunt when they get married that's a fact.", "YTA\n\nI get it.  I really do.  But whatever your problems with her are, address those problems.  Don\u2019t do this sort of shit.  It\u2019s unnecessary, and yes, asshole, if she marries your brother she\u2019ll be their aunt.\n\nDeal with it.", "I really don't want to call you an A  H because Amber is horrendous.   If they do marry, she'll technically be their Aunt.  Setting boundaries with her is the way to go but going all out on this subject makes YTA in a gentle way.  I would've gotten on her in defense of your mother, but you'd reached your limit.  Understandable.", "YTA\n\n  \nIf you and your family collectively hate Amber then why didn't you just talk to her about your problems and set boundaries? Especially if you know that your brother loves her so much. Amber may have an annoying personality that you don't like which is okay but actually she is going to be your kids' aunt...  \nYou were an absolute AH to her at the birthday party and your brother was right, you should apologise to her.", "YTA. Your problems are between you and her. No need to involve your kids in it. You could have kept your mouth shut as you have done for so long.", "Yta  for how you handled the situation but also for not realising that you started a mess .  There were a milion was to respond and you chose the shittiest one .  \nDo you realise this will get back to your ass for every birthday/holiday ?   \n\nAmber is AH  for her comments.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This woman has come into their lives and appointed herself auntie. She is not related to them in any way. My nephews and nieces are mine, my partners nephews are theirs. I cannot just waltz in and decide I'm their aunt. Amber has an attitude of entitlement, she roots through personal belongings, she moves around items in other people's houses and now she's demanding she's addressed by a title she hasn't yet earned??"]}
