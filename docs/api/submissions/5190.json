It depends on the emotional tie you want to encourage, and Amber can't force it upon you or your children.\n\nAlso note all the friends-of-family who are considered and actively referred to as aunt/uncle by both parents and children. These people are aunt/uncles because that's the emotional tie they have grown and the responsibility they've earned to be allowed to take on. This allowance isn't restricted to only friends of family having to earn it - other family members have to earn it, too.

Notice how she makes him do all the patching when she experiences something is off with your family, and how he says \"What do you want me to do? I love her!\" as if him loving her and her loving him somehow excuses her behavior. I'm not gonna assume you haven't talked with him about it, that isn't my place, but...

It distinguishes between the paternal and maternal sides of the family, with a distinct term for each.\n\nMy point is that once a woman joins a family, she generally receives a new title relative to that family.", "I think the word is \"estranged\" because the default setting would be that there was a relationship between aunt and niblings.", "People wanting to be called something they\u2019re not us the opposite of the issue at hand.", "That depends on how you define the word \u201cis\u201d lol", "Yeah, we call them \"familia pol\u00edtica\".

In this case, OP is using 'aunt', as his family does.\n\nHow hard is that to understand? Once married, she will have a new and appropriate cultural and linguistic title. Nobody can force anybody to use it.", "I am sorry but how is having someone who boundary stomps and violates peoples personal space, why should they be considered supportive?

I have 0 aunts tho relationship wise due to bad treatment of me.\n\nSo I'd say they are my aunts, but I never speak of them as more than that. So while they are technically speaking \"aunts\" by family order, they are no way in hell my aunts any more than their first name. I call them first name because personally they don't deserve the title of aunt.\n\nI choose that though.

It's a title that denotes familial relationship, it's not that precious.", "You can address the fact that she should not be overstepping without pretending like she is not their aunt.  It was untrue, ineffective at solving the actual issue, and petty", "Tbh I forgot about that lol it does make her a little more annoying but she is going be their aunt, and that wouldn't make me stop her from picking up my kid, no. Thats such a petty, pathetic punishment that really is going to hurt you and the kid just as much as her", "I'm going to go ahead and say NTA, because she seems like the type of person that demands respect but has absolutely no respect for her future husband's family. Sounds like a narcissist and to be honest, sometimes they need smacks like this in the face as a reminder that respect goes both ways.\n\nBy defenition she will be an aunt, but in this case it's not about the black on white definition, it's about what it means to be an aunt in \"spirit\".  Let's call it the emotional defenition. Fun, loving, trustworthy, respectful, etc.  Like 'what's the meaning of life' type of situation - what does it really mean to be an aunt.  She doesn't seem to have the characteristics of one.\n\nConsider this: if the family had a female best friend that had a close bond with the children and they would possibly out of their own free will start to refer to her as their aunt, disregarding the fact that by defenition she is not... should they then be told to no longer call her their aunt?", "NTA. Legally she is their aunt but if you don't want to consider her as their aunt, I don't think you have to. The kids don't need to call her Aunt Amber either if they don't want to and definitely don't need to be forced either way. \nI'm the same with my moms brother and sister. I never call them by Uncle James or Aunt Linda (fake names). I just call them by their first names. Legally they are my aunt and uncle, but because of a ton of stuff they've done to both my mom and my grandparents/their parents, I don't consider them as aunt or uncle.", "NTA you have the right to estrange from anyone. Make sure you are consistent in intent with your wife and that\u2019s all that matters.", "Agreed. ESH for sure. They all sound insufferable. I would also like Ambers story too. I'm sure OP said some pretty shitty,  out of line stuff too. This family sounds like the type of family where you have to pass a test to get in.

Unnecessary. If you feel that way about someone, you shouldn\u2019t invite them into your home.", "I'm not so sure Amber didn't say this in response to something else that was said. Like OP saying something about brother's previous conquests or something. Seems like a really weird thing to just blurt out.", "YTA, this is the definition of control freak.", "Ok?

If you want to be a stickler about webster definitions you should probably employ reading comprehension and take context into account.", "I agree. OP never talked to Amber about the issues, and randomly is like \"you'll never have that relationship with my kids\". It's dramatic and probably came out of nowhere for her, especially since he's known her for 2 years.

Now, this doesn't mean that a person doesn't know who one of their parents are--in most cases, there is a kinship recognition of the father or mother, but they often were considered to leave their family/clan/kin of origin and join their spouse's family. So their kids might belong solely to that family/clan/etc. It's not about biological or genetic relationships. Sure, your mother's sister is your biological aunt, but is she your *kin*, per the rules of your society, with the social recognition and obligations that come with it? Not always. There are other ways to create kin, too, that have nothing to do with marriage or genetic relationships. For instance in some Muslim groups, if your mom breastfeeds another child, that child is considered to be your kin (sibling), and rules/obligations/rights that come with that form of kinship are assumed.

Tell her she isn't welcome because of touching things she shouldn't, and going through people's things. Saying \"you aren't their aunt\" just makes the OP look petty (cuz she is) and jealous. Doubling down means no one will listen to her about anything actually wrong about Amber. She needs to apologize to her brother and tell him that she got protective of her kids, which parents do, and to please tell Amber to not touch things or people without asking since that's the actual issue.", "Some people really aren\u2019t socially adept and need to be specifically told that things are rude.", "Maybe she\u2019s not forcing affection on the kids. Maybe they like her. Kids don\u2019t always share their parents\u2019 opinions about people.", "Not everyone is the same. My family we did not call my aunts husband uncle. He was called by his name by all of HER nieces and nephews.", "But he doesn't have to allow her to be called aunt and that's literally the parents rights! If she continues to play these stupid little games it's the brother that's going to suffer! Personally, I'd already snapped at her for coming to my house and touching my stuff! She can earn that title but rn she does not have that title and as a matter of fact she isn't even married to the brother yet so she's definitely not aunt RIGHT NOW! She cannot self proclaim herself an aunt and she better respect the parents decision before she's the outcast of the family!", "Yes we had a terrible step aunt. Insane woman, no boundaries, horrible person. She was still my step aunt. She\u2019s gone now thankfully, but she was still a part of our family- just a part no one but my uncle liked.", "I think they\u2019re talking from a social aspect which I get is strange to see in this context, so let me make an example. Some people won\u2019t call the woman who gave birth to them their mother due to reasons or smth. Technically yes she would be considered their mother, but in a social aspect she isn\u2019t their mom, that relationship isn\u2019t there. Same for the aunt in this situation.\n\nAunt is disrespectful to OP and the other members of the family frequently overstepping boundaries that are in place (such as just grabbing someone else\u2019s child??). The idea of earning a title here is by repairing the relations with and respecting the parents of the child before trying to build an aunt-niece/nephew relationship with the child."]}
