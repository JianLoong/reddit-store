Clear this up now, you are going to have many other opportunities to squabble with here.", "YTA.\n\nYou can't choose family.

Understandable.", "YTA\n\n  \nIf you and your family collectively hate Amber then why didn't you just talk to her about your problems and set boundaries?

Or at least she could try to not be so irritating.\n\nYour brother should act accordingly, since you informed him about your problems with her.\n\nAs for her, bad manners and a large tongue.", "It seems to me, at this point, your choice is to have your brother in your life or not. He\u2019s committed to this relationship with Amber. \n\nYTA for making this the line you stop her at. You\u2019ve been pissed off at her for a long time, but if you want to have your brother in your family you\u2019re going to have to accept her, the same way your family has accepted your wife. I would have stopped her overstepping after the second or third property transgression, you would have been in the right, personal property is not joint/family property so she had no business moving/using any of it. Stopping her at that point would have communicated not only your boundaries but also that you won\u2019t allow them to be stomped on even if she was family. Then you stand against her badmouthing your brother with the perspective that she doesn\u2019t need to crap on his former moral compass in order to highlight his new one.\n\nYou\u2019d probably be a lot less pissed off at your brother\u2019s decision to marry her if you\u2019d addressed the original issues when they came up.", "YTA - once she marries your brother, she becomes the aunt, whether you accept it or not.", ">But then she added \u201cI\u2019ll do what your mom couldn\u2019t and teach him to be a gentleman\u201d.\n\nThis is a really rude thing to say.   Call t his out to your brother each and every time she says something like this.\n\nNTA, you and the kids get to define how the relationship grows between aunt and niblings, but she doesn't automatically get the \"aunty\" title.", "Yeah\u2026 YTA. Not for not liking her, she doesn\u2019t seem great. But she will be their aunt by marriage, her children will be your children\u2019s cousins. What you are doing is estranging your own brother.\n\nYou embarrassed her and your brother. You can discuss the problems you have with her instead of being rude to her. There\u2019s a time and a place", "YTA - You've let this situation simmer for far too long and it's turned into an irrational outburst. She is going to be their aunt and she's going to be part of your family. If you don't like something that she does, be an adult and talk it out with her (nicely). She probably has no idea what she's done wrong and if you really care about family, try and build some bridges and let her know what makes you uncomfortable and your boundaries.   \n If you don't, I suspect you'll all end up seeing less of your brother and when they eventually have kids you'll not be given an opportunity to be an aunt.", "Yea YTA here......(worse for the time and place you did it)  She maybe horrible, there maybe red flags, you may want to limit time with her and your kids, but assuming the marriage goes forward she WILL be their aunt.\n\nThat is a fact,", "In this interaction YTA \n\nI would have just said: for as long as you\u2019re married you\u2019re their aunt. Petty, yes. But also technically true. \n\nI don\u2019t think that people have to be married to be aunts or uncles and that partners or even divorced couples can maintain relationships. Heck, I have family friends I consider to be aunts and uncles more than my actual ones. The key here is that there is a relationship and in this case it didn\u2019t sound like there is one.", "YTA. She will be their aunt. Doesn't mean you need to have her in your life, but it is what it is.", "YTA She will be their aunt so you had better get used to it. Also, you misspelt fuckboi.", "YTA.  I get that you may not like her and she has some traits that make her an AH but you are just straight up mean.", "YTA.", "YTA - you involved kids in adult drama and you unnecessarily insulted her. You could have stayed distant but polite, thus allowing her to always be \u201cthe bad guy,\u201d but now you\u2019ve lowered yourself to her petty and immature level.", "YTA. You can dislike her all you like but she will be their aunt.", "YTA you decided that you don't like her but you don't get to make that decision for your kids. She will be their aunt once she and the brother gets married and heck, she might even end up being an amazing aunt to your kids. \nDon't ruin your kids relationship with their uncle and aunt just because of your opinion.", "YTA. You\u2019ve spoken to your brother about Amber crossing boundaries but have you spoken to Amber? If he doesn\u2019t speak to her she might think that you\u2019re all OK with her behaviour.  But all that aside, she **will** be your kids\u2019 aunt by marriage whether you like it or not.", "ESH. Being an aunt isn\u2019t like being a mom or sister where it\u2019s \u201csupposed\u201d to be by blood. It\u2019s literally by marriage. She will be your kids aunt the same way your other brothers wife is your aunt. \n\n\u201cSupposed\u201d in quotations because society puts a lot of idealization on bio family but not all families are formed around that", "NTA - They\u2019re not married yet. Your brother needs to have a talk with her about what\u2019s appropriate. If they started dating when she was 19 she may just genuinely be a clueless teenager. With them getting married and potentially having children there\u2019s not much you can do except hope that she grows up. I\u2019d just be worried about alienating cousins in the future. I can see why you\u2019d bet on this not lasting though.", "INFO: did you ever talk to Amber? She is a grownup and when someone steps over obvious boundaries, you are supposed to tell them, not tell on them to their partner.", "You are. Her marrying your brother makes her their aunt. If you have a problem with her, you work it out. Leave the kids out of it.", "INFO. Does she swear like that in front of the kids or is otherwise inappropriate with them? Also, have you told her and set boundaries about how she acts in your homes? You could apologise but tell her you don't expect these unsavoury behaviours in your home, and contact with your children will be limited for now as you find these behaviours to be untrustworthy. \n\nHowever, I am wavering towards ESH as she will be an aunt and it is confusing for others and your kids to call her otherwise. It may also cause bigger rifts. You may be able to change the narrative for all of you to something more positive, and if after all, she doesn't change, eventually your brother may see that it is her that is the issue. Until then, be polite while approriate and keep your brother on side.", "YTA she is their aunt, and if they have kids your kids cousins. Grow up and stop hating the poor girl. This is tje reason people cut contact with toxic family members", "Yta. Because this looks like it will go to marriage.\nShe will be their aunt.\nShe might be the mother of their cousins. \nShe overstepped boundaries using your items, so address that. Don't mix issues like this.", "This and I wonder if they tell amber no or to stop. I mean yes she shouldn't move stuff or take stuff without asking but did they ever tell her to her face \"don't take xy, don't move xy\"?!", "Yeah I agree, ESH.\n\nShe's completely overbearing, but if they get married she will be their aunt whether you like it or not.\n\nSaying that, my younger brother had a girlfriend who sounds very much like Amber. She had been going out with him for 6 months and was calling my parents \"mum and dad\", which I found totally ick, on top of a whole host of other weird shit. Safe to say they broke up after not too long because he realised what a psycho she was. \ud83e\udd1e your brother works that out too", "I\u2019d vote ESH. OP was out of line for the way she went about that, because she was being perfectly friendly to her kids, but if the fianc\u00e9 has actually said that about OPs mother in front of the family that\u2019s disgusting", "Just because she's gonna marry their uncle doesn't make okay picking up a 2yo you barely interacts with and putting the poor girl on the spot like that... she can be overbearing all she wants with house items, but toddlers imo is another story.", "Ha no. If the parents don't want to give that label, she doesn't get it. She will be their uncles wife. People's cultures and families are different, and labels are dished out differently", "I'm not married to my partner yet but his brother's children have always called me auntie (my name).", "Doesn't mean he has to make his kids that. They might get divorced within a year and she'll be gone and then another'aunt' will be in the picture. \n\nHe does right to protect his kids from what sounds like a vile woman NTA", "Aunt and Uncle are earned titles and roles, bio or married, and this is NOT the kind of person you want spending a lot of time with their kids (re: enough time to influence their language and ideas of what love is). She'll never get to earn the Aunt title and role unless she changes her ways.", "Or be the woman OPs brother married. Like if a woman marries a divorced man and the kids don\u2019t get along with her, she would be the woman their father married.", "This I think people are getting caught up in technical terms I called basically any adult that I liked and my parents liked aunt or uncle. Those terms are often terms of love or respect as well as a official term. If she doesn\u2019t act like what OP or her kids fell like an aunt should. Then she\u2019s not their aunt in anyway that matters", "He doesn\u2019t have to let them see her. The parents can dictate what they see her as (i.e label), because they are young. It\u2019s like saying a close family friend is an aunt but she\u2019s not she just very close to the family.", "She\u2019s a grown adult, it shouldn\u2019t have to be set to come into someone\u2019s house and not move things. She is or was new to the family they didn\u2019t know her, she should have known not to do that.", "amber isn't a 12 year old, in what world do you need to tell a grown adult \"hey don't insult my family, steal my things or think you can rearrange my house\"", "Fiance just seems like she's in some sort of Dom/Sub situation and Former Playboy Bro is LOVING IT.\n\n(YTA OP)", "Have you ever interacted with a 2 year old. On the spot? That\u2019s a good one.", "Vile woman is a stretch far no? Honestly sounds like OP just needs to place some boundaries with them. She could be autistic and not realise what she\u2019s saying/doing is as blunt and weird as it is. Telling her that she can\u2019t just come into peoples houses and move things and saying how about she gets to know the kids first. I could be wrong but this could all be solved by simple conversation.", "Yes agreed that.She completely commands attention.", "Hi Amber", "He can refer to her however he likes, of course he can! And as I said, he can make sure she's practically a stranger. What he can't do is change the fact that she *is* (or will be) their aunt and his brother and the rest of the family may well call her that. He can't erase her place in the family, he can only alter what that means for his children."]}
