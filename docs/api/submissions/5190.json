It depends on the emotional tie you want to encourage, and Amber can't force it upon you or your children.\n\nAlso note all the friends-of-family who are considered and actively referred to as aunt/uncle by both parents and children. These people are aunt/uncles because that's the emotional tie they have grown and the responsibility they've earned to talbe allowed to take on. This allowance isn't restricted to only friends of family having to earn it - other family members have to earn it, too.

I am concerned for your brother. Amber says she gave him a spine. She didn't; she bend it to her will. Notice how she makes him do all patching when she experiences something is off with your family, and how he says \"What do you want me to do? I love her!\" as if him loving her and her loving him somehow excuses her behavior. I'm not gonna assume you haven't talked with him about it, that isn't my place, but...

Luckily people seem forgiving of Irish \u2018quirks\u2019 but I am so not down for friends saying their kid can call me aunt Gerbil. Nope, nope, nope. Just use my name. Do not attach this extra dynamic especially without checking.

That's not what OP was asking about so its irrelevant", "You do know some cultures label 1st cousins as Aunt/Uncle and your 1st cousins kids are considered your neices/nephews. All cultures and families are different she will be his brothers wife and legally family sure but that doesnt automatically make her their Aunt she is their uncles wife and its likely Op wont have his kids around her anyway so that Aunt relationship will never form.

It literally says nothing of that sort in the post?", "You are just looking at her and that would be fine if she was solo. But by not having a relationship with her, the relationship with his brother will pretty much be over as he will back his wife up and in this case she is not wrong. She will be their aunt. Also then there will possibly be no relationship with their kids if they have any. It may not affect him but could affect his kids. My kid loves having cousins even though he doesn't see them often but would love to. \nThey just need to set boundaries when she starts to use their stuff. Every time, No you must ask for permission.
