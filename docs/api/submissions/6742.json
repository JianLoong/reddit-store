You are catering to a 5-year-old and your husband on texture and smell issues and accommodating your pregnancy food triggers (no judgement on that one and it's temporary), but your stepdaughter is going to look at that and think \"wow, OP and dad consider everyone else's likes and dislikes but don't care about mine.\"\n\n If you are not going to accommodate your stepdaughter's dietary lifestyle, then your son needs to learn to eat what is put in front of him and so does your husband.  I get the dairy and gluten intolerance are real issues and need to be accommodated, and your issues are temporary.  However, veganism is a legitimate lifestyle, and it has helped some people I know with hormonal and pms issues.  Could a health factor be a reason for this new eating style?  Your stepdaughter is 12 and probably starting puberty.  \n\nYou all need to find ways to make this work for her. If she is only at your house 40 percent of the time, she is not there that often.  Continue with the frozen options (you'll have to suck up the added cost) and teach her some easy recipes she can make herself.

You\u2019re making accommodations for your son but not your step-daughter is treating them differently. Your husband \u201cnot allowing\u201d certain foods in the house is very controlling. Also, it\u2019s his daughter, he needs to help out with the cooking and not just criticize you. \n\nWondering if the mom might be able to help for a while by sending some leftovers to you and helping you learn how to cook some meals?", "I feel, too, that more information is needed. How old is your stepdaughter, and what are the specifics regarding why she wants to go vegan? If it\u2019s a health thing, then that probably shouldn\u2019t be ignored. If it\u2019s just because, for example, all her friends are, then that\u2019s another. If it\u2019s because of a moral principle, like say, she protests eating animal-based ingredients, then that would probably necessitate a different path.\n\nAlso, insofar as your son/husband\u2019s dietary restrictions, are these medically necessitated, like with food allergies? Or just personal preferences?\n\nFor example, I hate coffee. I would never drink coffee. I don\u2019t even like the smell of coffee. But if I\u2019m around someone who does, it doesn\u2019t make me throw up.\n\nBy contrast, I have friends who are vegan, one of whom has had a severe allergy to animal proteins since he was 8yo. If he so much as eats something that was cooked in the same pan as animal meat, he goes into fits of vehement vomiting\u2014 because his digestive system cannot handle animal proteins.\n\nIf it\u2019s not related to allergies or food sensitivity, or a different medical issue, maybe having each member of the family choose what you cook one night per week might give some sort of a sense of fairness.\n\nAlternatively, you could make cooking a family affair and have the others (including the kids) get involved in the cooking process. Not only do kids oftentimes love to help, but they\u2019ll probably thank you later in life for teaching them a valuable life skill, especially if they have very specific dietary needs.\n\nI have every confidence that you and your family will find a system that works for all of you. Just know, though, that the burden does not all have to be yours. \ud83d\ude42", "Apparently you don\u2019t care about your stepdaughter. There was another story about a stepchild(16y) gone vegan. Yes you did research but you are basically pushing her away. I don\u2019t know why a 12y wanted to go vegan but it looks bad on you for accommodating her dietary needs.\n\nYTA!", "YTA. Did you or your husband ask why your stepdaughter has chosen to go vegan? Oftentimes, it is due to moral beliefs. If that is the case, you are forcing this child to go against her morals to eat the food at your house. If her veganism is for health reasons, forcing her to eat what you make could be making her feel physical ill. 12 years old is definitely old enough to make that choice for herself, and disregarding her choices is very disrespectful to her as an individual. You are signaling to her that her needs (and possibly core beliefs) don't matter to you. As someone with food aversions myself, your son's and husband's food aversions are no more valid than your stepdaughter's. She might be equally disgusted with your eating animal products, but she keeps it to herself. To me, it doesn't sound like she is trying to force her dietary restrictions on others, but is just asking that you provide something vegan she can eat. I get that it's not easy. I know it takes extra effort and cost, but there are plenty of things that are vegan that your son and husband might enjoy. There are certainly others that they wouldn't have a problem with having in the house. You could also try to teach her how to make easy vegan meals for herself so you aren't responsible for cooking multiple meals. Or your husband could step up, since she's his daughter and he doesn't seem to be helping. But you both need to step up. Instead of forcing a 12-year-old to step out of her comfort zone, maybe you and your husband could try doing the same. Otherwise, it wont be long before stepdaughter decides she wants to stay with her mom full-time so she doesn't have to compromise on her diet.

Only part of the meal is highly processed or frozen, and I'd rather see her eat something with a reasonable amount of protein, even if it's vegan junk food, than to emulate you and live off vegetables. Vegetables are awesome and we should all eat more of them, but they do not make a balanced diet by themselves. \n\nHave you considered enlisting your stepdaughter in figuring out how to accommodate her?

Two meals for her you don't have to worry about.\n\nWork with her mom to come up with one vegan recipe your 12-year-old likes and can put together HERSELF once a week and have her make double so she can eat it twice while the rest of you eat something non-vegan. There's nothing wrong with repetition in kids' diets if the food is healthy. 12-year-olds can definitely cook simple meals. Two more meals.\n\nCome up with ONE vegan meal you can all enjoy and agree on and cook that once a week. Vegan, gluten free chili could be a good starting point. If hubby doesn't like it, he can throw together a salty gluten-free treat like an over-seasoned steak for himself that night.\n\nInstead of making one meal a week with your 12-year-old, make one vegan **batch** meal a month with her that's just for her and can be frozen. Homemade, so ignore any objections from hubby. A batch of vegan shepherd's pie, mac and cheese, or moussaka should give you at least 8 servings for the month that make up her last two meals per week, and it's surprisingly affordable when you think of it as one big dish that goes a long way.\n\nI'd honestly get mom and step-daughter's buy in on this approach and tell hubby it's a done deal.

He also needs to allow reasonable accommodations (like frozen items) to meet the diverse and conflicting needs of the household.

Found a few recipes online. Any pointers?", "I don't think you should offer that. It is absurd. It is her mother. If her mother is so worried about the daughter eating what she likes, she should send her meals. Is what any caring parent would do. Also, if It comes to it, your husband should be the one dealing with it, not you. You are allowing your husband to treat you as his maid. If I were you I would talk to both husband and daughter together and explain that is impossible to keep accommodating everyone and make it clear that YOURSELF is not having a good meal because the whole food situation is getting out of hand. \n\nI would give them options:\n1. Husband can cook for the daughter, as he should, since he is the parent. \nIf he don't want to:\n2. The daughter is getting frozen food more often. Maybe you guys can cook together on the weekend and just froze meals in portions.\n3. Daughter can learn to cook for herself. I have a lot of vegetarian friends that learned to cook for themselves at the same age of your daughter. Offer to help her, but that is it. \n4. If daughter and husband are not happy about it, they can talk to her mother and figure out a solution. Since in the past her mother would throw a fit if you tried to parent the daughter, don't get in the middle. The 3 of them can find a solution without you. \n\nSounds like your husband is only allowing you to be involved if it is to take advantage from you. Stop letting him act like is your responsability make things easy for him. You are not a restaurant nor a maid. You are pregnant, you need to take care of yourself. \n\nAlso: the overseasing and not taking criticism very well is BS. Your husband don't want to improve his cooking because it is easier to suck at it and dump all the cooking on you.

They have Just Egg to make scrambled eggs from or you can apparently bake with too but I also substitute flaxseeds. I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to give up when your husband has placed such strict rules on the food that can be in house and eaten through the week. I was in tears and going hungry for the first month after finding out my allergies and intolerances because I didn\u2019t know what I would be able to eat when looking at ingredients in stores and almost everything had something I couldn\u2019t have. But there\u2019s vegan cheese that taste amazing from Follow your Heart and the Daisy brand as well.
