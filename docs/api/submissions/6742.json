You are catering to a 5-year-old and your husband on texture and smell issues and accommodating your pregnancy food triggers (no judgement on that one and it's temporary), but your stepdaughter is going to look at that and think \"wow, OP and dad consider everyone else's likes and dislikes but don't care about mine.\"\n\n If you are not going to accommodate your stepdaughter's dietary lifestyle, then your son needs to learn to eat what is put in front of him and so does your husband.  I get the dairy and gluten intolerance are real issues and need to be accommodated, and your issues are temporary.  However, veganism is a legitimate lifestyle, and it has helped some people I know with hormonal and pms issues.  Could a health factor be a reason for this new eating style?  Your stepdaughter is 12 and probably starting puberty.  \n\nYou all need to find ways to make this work for her. If she is only at your house 40 percent of the time, she is not there that often.  Continue with the frozen options (you'll have to suck up the added cost) and teach her some easy recipes she can make herself.

You\u2019re making accommodations for your son but not your step-daughter is treating them differently. Your husband \u201cnot allowing\u201d certain foods in the house is very controlling. Also, it\u2019s his daughter, he needs to help out with the cooking and not just criticize you. \n\nWondering if the mom might be able to help for a while by sending some leftovers to you and helping you learn how to cook some meals?", "I feel, too, that more information is needed. How old is your stepdaughter, and what are the specifics regarding why she wants to go vegan? If it\u2019s a health thing, then that probably shouldn\u2019t be ignored. If it\u2019s just because, for example, all her friends are, then that\u2019s another. If it\u2019s because of a moral principle, like say, she protests eating animal-based ingredients, then that would probably necessitate a different path.\n\nAlso, insofar as your son/husband\u2019s dietary restrictions, are these medically necessitated, like with food allergies? Or just personal preferences?\n\nFor example, I hate coffee. I would never drink coffee. I don\u2019t even like the smell of coffee. But if I\u2019m around someone who does, it doesn\u2019t make me throw up.\n\nBy contrast, I have friends who are vegan, one of whom has had a severe allergy to animal proteins since he was 8yo. If he so much as eats something that was cooked in the same pan as animal meat, he goes into fits of vehement vomiting\u2014 because his digestive system cannot handle animal proteins.\n\nIf it\u2019s not related to allergies or food sensitivity, or a different medical issue, maybe having each member of the family choose what you cook one night per week might give some sort of a sense of fairness.\n\nAlternatively, you could make cooking a family affair and have the others (including the kids) get involved in the cooking process. Not only do kids oftentimes love to help, but they\u2019ll probably thank you later in life for teaching them a valuable life skill, especially if they have very specific dietary needs.\n\nI have every confidence that you and your family will find a system that works for all of you. Just know, though, that the burden does not all have to be yours. \ud83d\ude42", "Apparently you don\u2019t care about your stepdaughter. There was another story about a stepchild(16y) gone vegan. Yes you did research but you are basically pushing her away. I don\u2019t know why a 12y wanted to go vegan but it looks bad on you for accommodating her dietary needs.\n\nYTA!", "YTA. Did you or your husband ask why your stepdaughter has chosen to go vegan? Oftentimes, it is due to moral beliefs. If that is the case, you are forcing this child to go against her morals to eat the food at your house. If her veganism is for health reasons, forcing her to eat what you make could be making her feel physical ill. 12 years old is definitely old enough to make that choice for herself, and disregarding her choices is very disrespectful to her as an individual. You are signaling to her that her needs (and possibly core beliefs) don't matter to you. As someone with food aversions myself, your son's and husband's food aversions are no more valid than your stepdaughter's. She might be equally disgusted with your eating animal products, but she keeps it to herself. To me, it doesn't sound like she is trying to force her dietary restrictions on others, but is just asking that you provide something vegan she can eat. I get that it's not easy. I know it takes extra effort and cost, but there are plenty of things that are vegan that your son and husband might enjoy. There are certainly others that they wouldn't have a problem with having in the house. You could also try to teach her how to make easy vegan meals for herself so you aren't responsible for cooking multiple meals. Or your husband could step up, since she's his daughter and he doesn't seem to be helping. But you both need to step up. Instead of forcing a 12-year-old to step out of her comfort zone, maybe you and your husband could try doing the same. Otherwise, it wont be long before stepdaughter decides she wants to stay with her mom full-time so she doesn't have to compromise on her diet.

Only part of the meal is highly processed or frozen, and I'd rather see her eat something with a reasonable amount of protein, even if it's vegan junk food, than to emulate you and live off vegetables.

She just needs to have the ingredients available so she has the option.", "I haven't tried them yet but I picked up some sweet potato noodles at the international store that look decent. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/s?k=korean+sweet+potato+noodles&adgrpid=55820270637&gclid=Cj0KCQiAzeSdBhC4ARIsACj36uEh711NrdwckhbATv4xTLDNFNoim1_-srGrqoSAxEsVcEmKl9Yd4vgaAhfYEALw_wcB&hvadid=617073305257&hvdev=m&hvlocphy=9030014&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=1972768965010089313&hvtargid=kwd-300429996380&hydadcr=15119_13597550&tag=hydsma-20&ref=pd_sl_4tmomcrq1f_e", "I like Jovial noodles", "Gluten cross contaminate is very serious. Depending on severity, that might require an entirely separate set of pots, utensils, etc for the gluten ones.", "You can make pasta with like bobs red mill gluten free and water too. Most noodles are just flour+water and are vegan by default (obvi egg noodles don't fall in that but its in the name) does Einkorn set you off?", "I'm celiac, I feel like it's more usual than not. All the noodles in my pantry would be vegan. They're generally a mix of rice and veggie or legume flours, or just plain rice. Try some Asian grocery stores for rice noodles perhaps?", "Ha ha, I will admit if the preference was no salt at all, while it\u2019s still easy to accommodate I would definitely be quietly muttering \u201cyou weirdo!\u201d while prepping the dish \ud83d\ude04", "Right? Aim higher than the floor. It\u2019s very sad to see and all too common.", "When I met my husband he could barely cook a TV diner in the microwave, and although he's no chef now, I thought him some basic skills in the kitchen, enough that if I'm too tired or not feeling well, he can step in and feed the family. \n\nWhere he struggles is seasonings as well, he needs a recipe that says put 1/4 tsp of salt, he can't eyeball it so sometimes if he's wanting something more complex while cooking he asks me to just come and season it when it's time to add them in.", "Step daughter is then a 12yo going without proper fat and protein intake\u2026.\n\nWorking around noodles and mushrooms, or even fish, is one thing\u2026. Vegan is a MUCH bigger deal. If you think it is not, you are just plain ignorant on how much care needs to be taken to get the proper nutrition without ANY animal products.", "That\u2019s bs. OP is doing everything she can while taking care of an autistic son, an ah of a husband, works nights full time, pregnant and now sd has a wild hair to become vegan? No! If sd wants that she can get her butt in gear and help! Or here\u2019s a wild hair bio mom can help out more instead of everyone thinking OP is supposed to cater to all of them while cutting every thing she likes out just to try and please the others! If I was OP I would take my son and leave.", "Unsure of the erikon, ty for the suggestion! I do desperately need an updated food allergy panel \ud83d\ude2c. I have a gluten intolerance (not celiac), but I do also have food sensory issues myself. I do still think the husband is the AH, even if he does have autism.", "Rice noodles I can find, and while i like them, it can be tedious to have consistently for me.", ">Step daughter is then a 12yo going without proper fat and protein intake\u2026.\n\nSays who?\n\n>Working around noodles and mushrooms, or even fish, is one thing\u2026.

You think rice and broccolini is an adequate meal? \n\nAnd I understand many people, even kids, can eat healthy as a vegan, but it is absolutely insane to think that veganism is on par with \u201cjust not liking fish\u201d or what ever. It basically requires a full replacement (or duplicates) of many staple items like butter, eggs, milk. It cuts off easy and cheap sources of protein. Veganism is closer to a different lifestyle than a just a few dietary restrictions.", "Autism has a genetic component and tends to run in family. \n\nThe husband is still an asshole for how he's dealing with the situation, but I wouldn't be surprised if he was autistic too.", "I even found noodles made from peas in my local asian store. But i updoot, soba are delicious with many dishes", "Well, dad\u2019s lactose intolerant, so unless OP\u2019s making omelettes for dinner every night they\u2019re well on their way to being able to accommodate a vegan diet.\n\nThere are plenty of ways that the stepdaughter can get adequate nutrition without requiring the entire family to change their already very narrow eating habits."]}
