She got mad and really demanded to know why I was wearing blue if I wasn't a senior. I told her that I didn't have to follow the color rules because it's not mandatory.\n\nShe didn't reply, but she took away points from my assignment. It didn't hurt my grade at all, but it still pissed me off.\n\nA few of my friends got mad at me when I told them what happened, and one of them said that I could part with my jacket for a day. I've only worn this jacket for two days at this point. Another said I wore it on purpose to confuse teachers and that I was an AH because of it.
