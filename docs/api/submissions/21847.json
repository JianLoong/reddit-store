His dad left him some land before he passed 3 years ago and that's where we were heading. We have a 3yo Corgi as well, name Juniper. \n\nWell, before we left we had some loose ends we needed to tie up and ended up getting our buddy to watch Juniper for us for a couple hours so we could hit the bank and she could run around before we took off. We got a phone call not even 45 minutes later saying she was hit by a truck. She ended up needing extensive surgery on her back end and was put on \"kennel rehab\" for 6 weeks. Our buddy paid for the surgery, due to saying it was his fault because he hadn't been watching her. Given that she was not able to travel now (we have absolutely no space for a kennel in our van), our SIL told us she would let us park in her driveway and she would keep Juniper in her home for the 6 weeks healing time and we could pay her $100 a week for housing her. We have been here 3 weeks. We bath at the YMCA, we cook on our hot plates at the end of our van. The only time we go indoors is to tend to Juniper or go to the bathroom. She does not take care of Juniper at all, we do. \n\nWell, last night she said we needed to have a talk and told us that we needed to take Juniper in the van with us. We just paid her the $100 on Saturday morning for this week's payment (so the day before our talk) and when I mentioned that, she said she had already spent that money on bills and couldn't reimburse us, so I told her she would have to suck it up for a week then because that was the agreement, and after that we would figure it out. She says we are AHs because she is \"doing us a favor\" and she's tired of walking in to her living room and hearing Juniper whining. I told her if she wanted us to bail out before rehab was over than she shouldn't have taken out money.

I don't know where you live, but most places there are better options for $100 a week. I'm in one of the world's most expensive cities and you can board a dog, even one with medical needs, for less than that. In an inexpensive area, I'd think you could rent a room for both you and your dog for that!", "NTA. I\u2019d be worried though that she\u2019d be bad at watching Juniper for that week out of resentment and probably take the $100 loss to protect my dog \u201cjust in case\u201d. Sorry for the position you are in and my sympathies to Juniper! I hope that they recover well. Poor thing\u2026", "NTA.  She took your money so she owes you another week.  PERIOD.  She's TA for backing out of the deal 3 weeks early.", "NTA and your SIL is a huge one. Who is related to her?", "NTA. She is not helping or doing you a favour. You are paying her rent for your dog to stay in her house. She is an asshole.", "NTA, but I wouldn't want to leave my dog alone with her anymore.", "NTA - I'd be concerned with your dog's well-being. Especially if her whining is enough to want to kick her out. She won't even bring her into her bedroom, in the kennel???\n\nI will sleep on the ground with a scared dog, if they won't let me pick them up. Talking to them or singing a non high pitched tone, \"Don't you cry, don't you cry. Everything's going to be okay, your owner will be home soon and save the day!\" Or something equally cheesy.", "If I walked into a room and heard a dog whining, I'd go over and find out the problem.  Maybe she's just lonely and would like to be petted.  Or read to.  Or just have someone else in that room.  Or maybe she's still in pain.  I understand that not everyone likes dogs or wants to like dogs or wants to deal with dogs, but in that case it's pretty easy not to have a dog.  Your SIL agreed to house your dog.  It sounds like she knows nothing about dogs.\n\nCould you compromise by having one of you sit with Juniper so she doesn't whine?  Or so you can see if there's a physical problem causing her to whine?\n\nI'm very pro-dog so I'm not impartial at all.  But it seems to me there are things that can be done to make Juniper whine less.", "First of all, I don't know where you are but I know \"dog people\" everywhere, so feel free to shoot me a PM if you need help finding a place for Juniper.\n\nNTA, and your SIL sucks", "NTA, it was an agreement, but do you really want Juniper in her house knowing how she feels about her? it doesn\u2019t sound like she cares about Juniper at all. Poor thing. She talks about the poor hurt doggo like an inconvenience (even while making money), and the last person she was left with admittedly didn\u2019t watch her and she got hit by a truck after only 45 min. Personally, I just feel bad for Juniper and hope her luck improves.\n\nOP I would really think about finding a different solution - I know options are different since you\u2019re in the van, and paying someone else would be more expensive, but I wouldn\u2019t like the idea of Juniper having to be in that lady\u2019s house for another three weeks. If she talks about her like an annoyance, she treats her (at the very minimum) as an annoyance.", "NTA your SIL wants to be a thief! Don\u2019t let her do this to y\u2019all.", "NTA", "NTA. What you have with your SIL is a binding contract. You agreed on terms and cost for her watching and caring for your recuperating dog. You fulfilled your end of the agreement when you paid the $100.00 per week and your SIL accepted it.\n\nHow your SIL spent that money is not your concern.\n\nShe's not doing you a favor out of the goodness of her heart; she's been economically enriched by your $100.00/week payments.\n\nThe only issue that clouds the matter is the agreement probably wasn't put in writing and probably didn't have a witness present when the terms were ironed out. Hopefully, you didn't pay in cash; a paper trail showing when and where the $100.00 payments were made would bolster your claim -- hopefully, it won't come to that.", ">She is and isn't doing you a favor. She's accepting money in exchange for a service, for lack of a better word.\n\nEh I think it is both. SIL is doing OP a favor because $100 a week for pet boarding/van parking/camping services seems like it is on the low end. Yes it is still money in exchange for a service, and OP is legally entitled to the rest of the week. But I think even seeing it as $133 per week ($400 for 3 weeks) is still cheaper than normal. \n\nIf a family member/friend has a plumbing business and they normally charge $700 for x service, but give you a $500 friends/family rate it is doing you a favor and a service."]}
