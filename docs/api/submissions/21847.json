His dad left him some land before he passed 3 years ago and that's where we were heading. We have a 3yo Corgi as well, name Juniper. \n\nWell, before we left we had some loose ends we needed to tie up and ended up getting our buddy to watch Juniper for us for a couple hours so we could hit the bank and she could run around before we took off. We got a phone call not even 45 minutes later saying she was hit by a truck. She ended up needing extensive surgery on her back end and was put on \"kennel rehab\" for 6 weeks. Our buddy paid for the surgery, due to saying it was his fault because he hadn't been watching her. Given that she was not able to travel now (we have absolutely no space for a kennel in our van), our SIL told us she would let us park in her driveway and she would keep Juniper in her home for the 6 weeks healing time and we could pay her $100 a week for housing her. We have been here 3 weeks. We bath at the YMCA, we cook on our hot plates at the end of our van. The only time we go indoors is to tend to Juniper or go to the bathroom. She does not take care of Juniper at all, we do. \n\nWell, last night she said we needed to have a talk and told us that we needed to take Juniper in the van with us. We just paid her the $100 on Saturday morning for this week's payment (so the day before our talk) and when I mentioned that, she said she had already spent that money on bills and couldn't reimburse us, so I told her she would have to suck it up for a week then because that was the agreement, and after that we would figure it out. She says we are AHs because she is \"doing us a favor\" and she's tired of walking in to her living room and hearing Juniper whining. I told her if she wanted us to bail out before rehab was over than she shouldn't have taken out money.

I don't know where you live, but most places there are better options for $100 a week. I'm in one of the world's most expensive cities and you can board a dog, even one with medical needs, for less than that. In an inexpensive area, I'd think you could rent a room for both you and your dog for that!"]}
