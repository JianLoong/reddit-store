They're saying that nonsense to you because you're free labor to them. Sounds like you're paying them to raise their kids FOR THEM if you're buying groceries and paying their bills. You will be fine. Finish your degree. Don't repeat your parents' mistakes, don't exploit your own children.", "NTA. You are 19 and an adult.", "NTA.  You're an adult with your own means, your own money, and if you're paying into their bills and covering your own too, I see no reason why you can't go out into the world and do your own thing.   It's not your place to sit the two youngest kids, at the expense of your independence and freedom.  I wish you all the best :)", "NTA\n\nI just want to plainly state to you before you make the actual move: you need to thoroughly plan this out and prepare yourself for the potential fallout.\n\nDetermine what your boundaries will be. Can they know where you live? Will you still occasionally help with your younger siblings? Where are documents like your birth certificate, social security card and passport? Do they have access to your bank account? Do they know any of your log-ins? Can you handle if they totally cut you off from your siblings as leverage? If you don't want them to show up at your new door, move into a building they can't just walk into. If they know where you work, do you need to get a new job so they can't harass you there or sell some sob story to a colleague to get your schedule or new address? You might need to avoid other family or friends and lock down social media.\n\nI hate to liken it to escaping an abusive situation but if you feel like you need to move out without saying a word, that sure sounds like you think they'll go further than just try to talk you out of it.", "NTA. You have to manage the move out in the best way for you.", "NTA. You're the \"third parent\" in this house and your parents have foisted too much responsibility onto you for too long...RUN! Get out and enjoy your freedom!", "NTA. Make a budget for yourself, rent, utilities, car or transportation, food, clothes as neeed, peesonal hygene needs. Make sure you have a way to afford them & this will greatly increase your good moving outcome.  Plan for Staying out , not just moving out.  I kinda want you to tell your parents in advance so they can plan their bills without you BUT they\u2019e overextended with bills  now, so I\u2019m concerned they would keep you from moving out. Try to keep in touch with your siblings after you move, youll miss each other unexpectedly.", "NTA looks like they're manipulating you too stay by telling you you couldn't make it without them... It seems that they couldn't make it without you. I wish you luck to find soon a nice place and peace!", "YWNBTA. Your parents like having you do the childcare, pay bills, etc. Of course they are telling you that you'll never make it on your own. Here's a hint: You WILL make it on your own, and you will thrive. Those are not your children to raise. Your parents chose to have them, they can do their own parenting. Remember to take all of your important paperwork (SS card, birth certificate, etc). And get ready to start your new exciting life not paying for other people to live. You got this!", "NTA and don't ever give them a key to your place.

But remember, you\u2019re telling them, not asking them.", "NTA You are well within your rights as an adult, but I have a few questions: Are you afraid your parents will sabotage you moving out if you give them notice?  Do you think they are telling you you won\u2019t be able to sustain yourself because they need your help? Have you budgeted how much it will cost you monthly vs how much your income is?\n\nPerhaps a good idea is to start looking for places and just go for it! Be brave if that\u2019s what you really want.  You can always help babysit for them or help out if you want right?\n\nPerhaps in the back of your mind you want to be able to fall back on them in the future if times get tough.

I honestly suggest moving out ASAP for your mental wellbeing and for your education", "NTA. There comes a point in time when we all start prioritizing ourselves (not in a selfish way).  You're at an age where you can see the circumstances can be toxic and are making an action plan to remove yourself from it.

Be prepared for a lot of pushback - they'll be losing free childcare along with rent money and it's not going to go down well. You're going to have to hold your own and keep going no matter how much they guilt you. Find a place first and secure it, then let them know.
