Have you investigated rent, utilities, insurance, fun money, food?   Would you maybe be better in looking for someone who is looking for a roommate?

Good luck!", "NTA at all, BUT, they\u2019re are probably right about moving out. No one that makes less than like 4k a month could afford to live alone right now. \n\nBuying food and paying phone bills is\u2026.so different. And it\u2019s awesome that your doing it, but you cannot compare it to rent. Also, your 19 which means if you have credit, you don\u2019t have enough (7 years) of credit history to even be considered for an apartment, even if you could pay the whole lease up front, they can\u2019t do anything about credit. Also, you need to be able to make at least 3 sometimes 4 times the amount of rent. So if you find a place for 1k a month (you won\u2019t) you\u2019ll need to be able to prove you make at least 4,500 monthly by yourself. My bf and I went through hell moving out right around your age, and it\u2019s getting worse, ESPECIALLY apartments. Don\u2019t waste your money on an application to an apartment complex they won\u2019t even look twice at you if you don\u2019t have 620+ credit score, plus 7+ years of credit history AND make 3x rent\u2026can\u2019t have one without the other. If you can find someone to co-sign that\u2019s different, but a co-signer will need to make at least 4x rent, and they\u2019ll be held responsible for unpaid bills or if something happened to you mid lease, so finding someone willing to co-sign is also\u2026extremely hard. \n\nYour best bet would be to find a room in someone\u2019s house/apartment. You\u2019ll probs be able to find a room for 5 to maybe 800 a month, with roommates. I don\u2019t mean to sound short or rude, but no one prepared me for this when I moved out. I\u2019m 22 and my boyfriend is 26\u2026.we STILL have to use a co-signer just because I only have like 5 years of credit history.

Especially the first year you HAVE to set up a strict routine for things like cleaning and shopping and bed time and wake up time or you will end up with everything piling up and all the stress that comes with it. \n\nHave two bank accounts. One account has all the money you need for bills in it.
