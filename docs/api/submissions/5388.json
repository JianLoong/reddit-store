I like it a lot and do it on the side as a hobby and make a lot of stuff for my family and friends and pay for everything myself. When my nephew told the family that he was going to be a dad we were surprised and delighted. I asked him if he and his girlfriend picked out a name and they told that it would be \"Ian\" if it was a boy and \"Sophie\" if it was a girl (fake names). I secretly decided to make two blankets with each name on it and gifted it to nephew and his family when I was finally allowed to see their son. They were delighted and it turned out that a neighbor of mine had also had a baby and decided to use the same \"Sophie\" for their daughter so I just gave them the blanket. \n\nWhen my daughter announced that she was going to be a mom I was excited and she loved the idea of me making her child a blanket to. My daughter waited until she knew the gender before telling me the name and I started making the blanket. After that a lot of the people in my family would come to me and ask if I would make them a blanket because of how well I made them. They offered to pay me but I refused and told them that this would be my gift to the baby and that all I ask is that they tell me what name they wanted months in advance do I could have plenty of time to make it as I still worked a full time job and did this on my free time. \n\nLast year my son's fianc\u00e9 announced her pregnancy and I was happy for them. I repeatedly asked for a name so I could start making the blanket, since my son and his fianc\u00e9 told me that wanted one and my son's fianc\u00e9 snapped at me and said that I'd get the name when I got it. After speaking to my son, he and his fianc\u00e9 decided to keep the name a secret until the baby was born so no one could steal it. I asked them how was I going to gift the baby a blanket with their name on it if I didn't know what it was, and they said I could just do a rush job later. \n\nWell the baby was born and the name was announced on social media. I was happy and went to visit but my son's fianc\u00e9 was upset with me for not bringing the blanket when I first met my grandson as per tradition. He was born on a Tuesday and I met him on Friday, and I worked everyday that week. Apparently my son's fianc\u00e9 was hurt that I didn't care enough take off work to rush the blanket. I told them that I'd make a blanket soon but then when I tried my hands started to get in massive pain, I went to see the doctor and given my age and the cold weather I may be developing arthritis and was advised to not do a list of activities until further notice. When I told my son and his fianc\u00e9 and they were again upset with me so I just decided to buy a blanket and apparently, I'm a petty and passive-aggressive Mother-In-Law who's punishing them for not being told the name when I first asked.

Life happens and now that traditional gift is no longer available. They should have told you the name in private and asked to keep it secret, or accept getting the blanket late, if at all.", "WOW... Just wow. Obviously NTA. Your son's fiancee sounds entitled. I laughed out loud when you said she expected you to take off work when the name was announced so you could start on the blanket. As if grandparents are entitled to family leave for the birth of their grandchildren. Sounds like you're going to have your hands full with your future DIL. I hope that your son is more understanding.", "NTA   People who feel entitled to gifts are AHs.  You made the same offer you made to others.  They decided that their agenda of keeping the name secret was more important.  Lots of people who like to fuck around aren't so keen on the finding out part of that game.\n\nAnd now you have a potential disability that may prevent you from delivering a traditional gift.  That's no one's fault, and if they make a stink about it, they're even bigger AHs than they already are acting like.", "NTA I've made knitted blankets in the past but couldn't for my actual grandchild because my hands hurt too much. My son and his gf understood. Dont hurt yourself or make it worse by doing this.", "Nta but your son and his soon to be wife are major AHs. You make blankets out of love with just one rule and they couldnt be bothered to follow it. The fact that they blew it off then got mad says a lot about them, and then the disrespect when you were put on restriction. I am sorry they are so ungrateful. I would love if my grandma was alive to crochet my kiddo a blanket... If you want, make the blanket and offer it to them but the Fianc\u00e9e will probably reject it because she seems to be a major AH and red flag walking.", "NTA\n\nYou asked for the name, and they said, \"You'll get it when the baby's here.\"\n\nGuess what, 4 days isn't enough time to crochet or knit anything, even if you're binging murder shows and angry crafting after the ungrateful duo refused to let you pick out yarn colors.\n\nI bought washable blue yarn and started knitting a blanket for my (eventual) niece the night I found out my sister had a baby that was coming.  I knit slow, and it wasn't finished until she was 5 months old, but she loves it.  I picked blue because it was washable yarn and the yarn store had enough skeins. She got that blankie when she was 5 months old and now that she's 8, she still loves that blankie.\n\nThere are a lot of posts on r/knitting right now about whether or not you HAVE to knit for people who are ungrateful. You're the one putting your heart and soul into the blanket. If you think your new grandson would appreciate it, by all means finish and present. If you don't, there is a little baby in the NICU who might appreciate a cuddly swaddle.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not obligated to give anyone a gift. And their own passive aggressive immature games over their child's name literally prevented you from being able to personalize it.\n\nThey sound extremely entitled.", " Nta. The fiance needs to grow up. Does she think blankets appear from thin air. Hope this is not what she is always like.", "NTA If you hands improve when it's warm make one for the child, not for his ungrateful parents. But its his blanket, it'd stink to be the only cousin without one", "NTA - I crochet, I know how long it takes to make even a baby blanket, even if you're using thick yarn. 4 days doesn't cut it. That's why the \"make it in a weekend\" crochet books are filled with hats, scarves, etc, always smaller projects. Calling you petty and vindictive is a level of entitlement that goes beyond the pale to me. I understand postpartum and hormones, however it makes me wonder if her parents ever taught her that she's not entitled to anything, especially gifts. Not giving a fig about your health or even asking about it shows a disregard for you that really angers me. The whole, \"I deserve it, it's mine, give it to me regardless of what it costs you physically\" is a disgraceful way to treat a close relative, especially one you're likely to ask for favors like babysitting from. Smh, you're not the a h here, she is and your son is the soft a h for letting her treat/talk to you like that. My daughter is pregnant and if her child's father acted like that his mother would probably go up one side of him and down the other. Surprised her parents aren't doing the same. If my daughter acted like that she'd have a serious problem on her hands when I found out and she knows it.\n\nETA - I hope your hands get better.", "NTA. Homemade knit or crocheted blankets are a lot of work, and expecting you to complete one in three days is the sign of someone who has never knit or crocheted. Now you also have a legitimate medical issue that is causing you pain and you have been advised to not do crochet.\n\nIf you were crocheting other things in the mean time and just refused to work on the project at all because you didn't know the name in advance, you would be the asshole. But under the circumstances you've described here, your son and DiL are being callous towards your health and unrealistic about how long homemade blankets take to make.", "They are the assholes for telling you to rush the job given your age and your work life. They purposefully delayed telling you the name because \"someone might steel it\", wtf even that mean?\n\nAnd they are pissed because you can't work that fast and you developed a painful health problem. They are throwing tantrums like a toddler. You are not to blame for any of it.\n\nYour grandkid would be fine with having his blanket 2-3 months later. You don't have to prove anything to anyone.", "NTA. My grandmother makes quilts regularly and she's 97. She typically does large ones like queen size but has done baby blankets as well. Each of her grandchildren got at least one baby blanket from her. Then later in life we each got at least one large blanket too. Though I've never done it myself I know this is hard work and time consuming. You aren't at fault for not having the time/ability to make the blanket. The girlfriend/fiance is acting very entitled and spoiled. It's a gift. You aren't required to give anything and she should have simply said thank you. Also expecting someone to do a \"rush job\" on something like that is just I have no words. You did nothing wrong and gf needs a reality check.", "NTA. They sound incredibly demanding. Your DiL is trying to find reasons to dislike you.", "NTA. I was on the fence in the beginning but the entitlement and attitude of both your son and his fianc\u00e9 is super gross, especially considering you were planning on making them a blanket the whole time and they're the ones who got pushy and made it weird.", "NTA. You sound like such an amazing and generous woman and I am so sorry that your son and his partner are mistreating you because that's the case. How dare they be mad at you when they chose to withhold the name and then expect you to work yourself ragged and produce a beautiful handmade gift in a few days!! The entitlement here is infuriating and I'm sorry you're going through this because like I said what you've been doing for your family is wonderful and admirable.", "NTA. Shit happens that is out of your control. How long do you think they will stay mad at you? Maybe you can have one made for them with the baby's name on it. Most people hold those special made blankets to their hearts and don't use them everyday.  Maybe try that way. Just saying.", "NTA. Seriously? No, they wanted you to wait for the name when you could have had it done if they told you. So they have to to wait for the blanket. What kind of weird power play is your son and his fiance playing here? There was no way you could have made them happy.", "NTA in the least, the sheer entitlement from your son's partner is shocking and frankly doesn't bode well for the future.\n\n\nReally you should also sell your house and gift them that too. You can just live under a bridge right....", "NTA. Jesus Christ the entitlement here is off the charts. For one, you\u2019re not obligated to put your time, money and work into making their baby a blanket. They chose to keep the name a secret therefore giving you no time to work on the blanket. That is the consequence of their choice. The absolute audacity to have expected you to take off work to make a blanket is so absurd that it\u2019s laughable. Both your son and his fianc\u00e9 are rude, inconsiderate and self absorbed.", "NTA. Please don\u2019t let them make you feel bad.", "NTA. Keeping the name secret is totally their prerogative BUT expecting you to take off work and do a \u201crush\u201d job to suit their needs is extremely selfish and entitled. No one is entitled to gifts, or another persons labour so they are both major AH for their attitudes. \n\nThe unfortunate thing is that the delay in telling you the name means you can no longer make the blanket because of your arthritis (sorry to hear btw). This is no one\u2019s fault, it\u2019s just bad timing. Such is life. It\u2019s unfair for them to belittle your pain and blame it on being a bad MIL. Have you done anything to your DIL to make her feel like you would be petty in this way? Do some serious digging on your past interactions and behaviour toward her. Usually those types of feelings don\u2019t come out of nowhere. \n\nAs a side note, my mom has arthritis in her hands and has found Cool Laser Therapy to be massively helpful.

I binged murder shows and crocheted as fast as I could and still didn\u2019t finish my daughter\u2019s pride blanket in time for her birthday.

I just need some energy.", "It's like her son never grew out of that phase where kids don't see their parents as having any life outside of them. In grade school they forget to tell you something big is needed the night before because they forget and just think parents are only there for them and it's age appropriate but irritating. At her son's age, it just makes him and his SO giant a-holes.", "OP is under no obligation to make anything for these people in the first place, let alone when they're so rude and demanding.

I get that it\u2019s a crazy time and maybe someone\u2019s initial reaction might not be great, but I\u2019d hope that after even a teeny tiny bit of reflection the new parents would realize what massively selfish assholes they\u2019re being.", "I knit, and am going to learn crochet, but does that new mom seriously think you can bang out a blanket in three days?!\n\nNot even with chunky yarn!  That's not happening, even with scads of time and yarn!

Maybe not those exact words. But the parents knew they would not be getting the blanket right away. Then the parents say they just expected OP to take the days off between the birth and visit. Parents are ridiculous entitled assholes.

Would you mind if it was a few weeks later?\u201d Instead she escalated it and bought them  something instead of explaining that it would be difficult for her to get it done quickly.

She makes these blankets as a gift and it\u2019s now tradition in the family. They specifically said she can do a rush job later as stated in the post. Additionally they were pissed she didn\u2019t take time off of work to make this blanket. As I see it, OP did all she could to include her grandchild in this tradition but somehow she\u2019s supposed to bend over backwards to appease some in my opinion entitled people", "I wouldn\u2019t make them anything either.\nI can\u2019t believe that they expected her to take off of work to make the blanket\u2026.who does that and who assume someone will give you a certain gift.", "I don\u2019t think it matters why the couple will not reveal the name until the baby is born. I know in my culture, first of all, we generally don\u2019t try to find out the gender before the baby is born.
