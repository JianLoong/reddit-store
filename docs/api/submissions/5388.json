I like it a lot and do it on the side as a hobby and make a lot of stuff for my family and friends and pay for everything myself. When my nephew told the family that he was going to be a dad we were surprised and delighted. I asked him if he and his girlfriend picked out a name and they told that it would be \"Ian\" if it was a boy and \"Sophie\" if it was a girl (fake names). I secretly decided to make two blankets with each name on it and gifted it to nephew and his family when I was finally allowed to see their son. They were delighted and it turned out that a neighbor of mine had also had a baby and decided to use the same \"Sophie\" for their daughter so I just gave them the blanket. \n\nWhen my daughter announced that she was going to be a mom I was excited and she loved the idea of me making her child a blanket to. My daughter waited until she knew the gender before telling me the name and I started making the blanket. After that a lot of the people in my family would come to me and ask if I would make them a blanket because of how well I made them. They offered to pay me but I refused and told them that this would be my gift to the baby and that all I ask is that they tell me what name they wanted months in advance do I could have plenty of time to make it as I still worked a full time job and did this on my free time. \n\nLast year my son's fianc\u00e9 announced her pregnancy and I was happy for them. I repeatedly asked for a name so I could start making the blanket, since my son and his fianc\u00e9 told me that wanted one and my son's fianc\u00e9 snapped at me and said that I'd get the name when I got it. After speaking to my son, he and his fianc\u00e9 decided to keep the name a secret until the baby was born so no one could steal it. I asked them how was I going to gift the baby a blanket with their name on it if I didn't know what it was, and they said I could just do a rush job later. \n\nWell the baby was born and the name was announced on social media. I was happy and went to visit but my son's fianc\u00e9 was upset with me for not bringing the blanket when I first met my grandson as per tradition. He was born on a Tuesday and I met him on Friday, and I worked everyday that week. Apparently my son's fianc\u00e9 was hurt that I didn't care enough take off work to rush the blanket. I told them that I'd make a blanket soon but then when I tried my hands started to get in massive pain, I went to see the doctor and given my age and the cold weather I may be developing arthritis and was advised to not do a list of activities until further notice. When I told my son and his fianc\u00e9 and they were again upset with me so I just decided to buy a blanket and apparently, I'm a petty and passive-aggressive Mother-In-Law who's punishing them for not being told the name when I first asked.

Life happens and now that traditional gift is no longer available. They should have told you the name in private and asked to keep it secret, or accept getting the blanket late, if at all.", "WOW... Just wow. Obviously NTA. Your son's fiancee sounds entitled. I laughed out loud when you said she expected you to take off work when the name was announced so you could start on the blanket. As if grandparents are entitled to family leave for the birth of their grandchildren. Sounds like you're going to have your hands full with your future DIL. I hope that your son is more understanding.", "NTA   People who feel entitled to gifts are AHs.  You made the same offer you made to others.  They decided that their agenda of keeping the name secret was more important.  Lots of people who like to fuck around aren't so keen on the finding out part of that game.\n\nAnd now you have a potential disability that may prevent you from delivering a traditional gift.  That's no one's fault, and if they make a stink about it, they're even bigger AHs than they already are acting like.", "NTA I've made knitted blankets in the past but couldn't for my actual grandchild because my hands hurt too much. My son and his gf understood. Dont hurt yourself or make it worse by doing this.", "Nta but your son and his soon to be wife are major AHs. You make blankets out of love with just one rule and they couldnt be bothered to follow it. The fact that they blew it off then got mad says a lot about them, and then the disrespect when you were put on restriction. I am sorry they are so ungrateful. I would love if my grandma was alive to crochet my kiddo a blanket... If you want, make the blanket and offer it to them but the Fianc\u00e9e will probably reject it because she seems to be a major AH and red flag walking.", "NTA\n\nYou asked for the name, and they said, \"You'll get it when the baby's here.\"\n\nGuess what, 4 days isn't enough time to crochet or knit anything, even if you're binging murder shows and angry crafting after the ungrateful duo refused to let you pick out yarn colors.\n\nI bought washable blue yarn and started knitting a blanket for my (eventual) niece the night I found out my sister had a baby that was coming.  I knit slow, and it wasn't finished until she was 5 months old, but she loves it.  I picked blue because it was washable yarn and the yarn store had enough skeins. She got that blankie when she was 5 months old and now that she's 8, she still loves that blankie.\n\nThere are a lot of posts on r/knitting right now about whether or not you HAVE to knit for people who are ungrateful. You're the one putting your heart and soul into the blanket. If you think your new grandson would appreciate it, by all means finish and present. If you don't, there is a little baby in the NICU who might appreciate a cuddly swaddle.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not obligated to give anyone a gift. And their own passive aggressive immature games over their child's name literally prevented you from being able to personalize it.\n\nThey sound extremely entitled.", " Nta. The fiance needs to grow up. Does she think blankets appear from thin air. Hope this is not what she is always like.", "NTA If you hands improve when it's warm make one for the child, not for his ungrateful parents. But its his blanket, it'd stink to be the only cousin without one", "NTA - I crochet, I know how long it takes to make even a baby blanket, even if you're using thick yarn. 4 days doesn't cut it. That's why the \"make it in a weekend\" crochet books are filled with hats, scarves, etc, always smaller projects. Calling you petty and vindictive is a level of entitlement that goes beyond the pale to me. I understand postpartum and hormones, however it makes me wonder if her parents ever taught her that she's not entitled to anything, especially gifts. Not giving a fig about your health or even asking about it shows a disregard for you that really angers me. The whole, \"I deserve it, it's mine, give it to me regardless of what it costs you physically\" is a disgraceful way to treat a close relative, especially one you're likely to ask for favors like babysitting from. Smh, you're not the a h here, she is and your son is the soft a h for letting her treat/talk to you like that. My daughter is pregnant and if her child's father acted like that his mother would probably go up one side of him and down the other. Surprised her parents aren't doing the same. If my daughter acted like that she'd have a serious problem on her hands when I found out and she knows it.\n\nETA - I hope your hands get better.", "NTA. Homemade knit or crocheted blankets are a lot of work, and expecting you to complete one in three days is the sign of someone who has never knit or crocheted. Now you also have a legitimate medical issue that is causing you pain and you have been advised to not do crochet.\n\nIf you were crocheting other things in the mean time and just refused to work on the project at all because you didn't know the name in advance, you would be the asshole. But under the circumstances you've described here, your son and DiL are being callous towards your health and unrealistic about how long homemade blankets take to make.", "They are the assholes for telling you to rush the job given your age and your work life. They purposefully delayed telling you the name because \"someone might steel it\", wtf even that mean?\n\nAnd they are pissed because you can't work that fast and you developed a painful health problem. They are throwing tantrums like a toddler. You are not to blame for any of it.\n\nYour grandkid would be fine with having his blanket 2-3 months later. You don't have to prove anything to anyone.", "NTA. My grandmother makes quilts regularly and she's 97. She typically does large ones like queen size but has done baby blankets as well. Each of her grandchildren got at least one baby blanket from her. Then later in life we each got at least one large blanket too. Though I've never done it myself I know this is hard work and time consuming. You aren't at fault for not having the time/ability to make the blanket. The girlfriend/fiance is acting very entitled and spoiled. It's a gift. You aren't required to give anything and she should have simply said thank you. Also expecting someone to do a \"rush job\" on something like that is just I have no words. You did nothing wrong and gf needs a reality check.", "NTA. They sound incredibly demanding. Your DiL is trying to find reasons to dislike you.", "NTA. I was on the fence in the beginning but the entitlement and attitude of both your son and his fianc\u00e9 is super gross, especially considering you were planning on making them a blanket the whole time and they're the ones who got pushy and made it weird.", "NTA. You sound like such an amazing and generous woman and I am so sorry that your son and his partner are mistreating you because that's the case. How dare they be mad at you when they chose to withhold the name and then expect you to work yourself ragged and produce a beautiful handmade gift in a few days!! The entitlement here is infuriating and I'm sorry you're going through this because like I said what you've been doing for your family is wonderful and admirable.", "NTA. Shit happens that is out of your control. How long do you think they will stay mad at you? Maybe you can have one made for them with the baby's name on it. Most people hold those special made blankets to their hearts and don't use them everyday.  Maybe try that way. Just saying.", "NTA. Seriously? No, they wanted you to wait for the name when you could have had it done if they told you. So they have to to wait for the blanket. What kind of weird power play is your son and his fiance playing here? There was no way you could have made them happy.", "NTA in the least, the sheer entitlement from your son's partner is shocking and frankly doesn't bode well for the future.\n\n\nReally you should also sell your house and gift them that too. You can just live under a bridge right....", "NTA. Jesus Christ the entitlement here is off the charts. For one, you\u2019re not obligated to put your time, money and work into making their baby a blanket. They chose to keep the name a secret therefore giving you no time to work on the blanket. That is the consequence of their choice. The absolute audacity to have expected you to take off work to make a blanket is so absurd that it\u2019s laughable. Both your son and his fianc\u00e9 are rude, inconsiderate and self absorbed.", "NTA. Please don\u2019t let them make you feel bad.", "NTA. Keeping the name secret is totally their prerogative BUT expecting you to take off work and do a \u201crush\u201d job to suit their needs is extremely selfish and entitled. No one is entitled to gifts, or another persons labour so they are both major AH for their attitudes. \n\nThe unfortunate thing is that the delay in telling you the name means you can no longer make the blanket because of your arthritis (sorry to hear btw). This is no one\u2019s fault, it\u2019s just bad timing. Such is life. It\u2019s unfair for them to belittle your pain and blame it on being a bad MIL. Have you done anything to your DIL to make her feel like you would be petty in this way? Do some serious digging on your past interactions and behaviour toward her. Usually those types of feelings don\u2019t come out of nowhere. \n\nAs a side note, my mom has arthritis in her hands and has found Cool Laser Therapy to be massively helpful.

Granted, you could have made a blanket without his name, but I bet they\u2019d still throw a fit over that. \n\nIt is extremely likely that the stress from the situation resulted in you holding your hands different or tighter and that your speed also impacted your hands. I\u2019ve done it to myself to the point where I couldn\u2019t use my hands for several hours. So take care, do any and all hand stretches and exercises that your doctor recommends, and take your time going back to crocheting. If you don\u2019t already have ergonomic hooks, look into them. \n\nYou are NTA for certain and it\u2019s clear that they didn\u2019t trust you to keep your mouth shut- after all, you couldn\u2019t \u201csteal\u201d the name yourself.", "NTA. I also crochet as a hobby, but I've never done names on blankets (kudos to you!). Crochet takes a long time and a baby blanket is a big project. I actually stopped making blankets for people and switched to booties and hats. It's ridiculous to take off work to make a gift just because they were keeping the name a secret. Crochet is super hard on your hands. Consider trying out some different ergonomic hooks or maybe doing this blanket with some thicker blanket yarn that works up faster.", "NTA\n\nI recently had a baby and I would not have told you the name because it is a surprise for everyone once bub is born. BUT, I would have said that upfront, so you wouldn't be hanging on for months, and I would have been happy if you chose to make one after baby was born, or chose not to. Because it is a gift. \n\nPersonally I no longer make things for people because they don't seem to appreciate it.", "NTA, though I probably would have gone ahead and made a blanket without a name. (Because at the speed at which I crochet the baby would be a freshman in college by the time I got done.)\n\nEdit to ask, why did your DIL get so snappy? All she had to do when you asked was reply kindly, \u201cWe\u2019re waiting until the baby is here before we announce the name.\u201d", "OP, I'm sorry your son and DIL are treating you this way. I hope this passes. 100% NTA. I also hope your arthritis is mild and easily controlled.", "And keeping the name secret so no one could STEAL it.  Because if the name was known, everyone would change their own to be the same name as the baby's, because that's what people do when they hear a baby's name. \n\nIf I roll my eyes any harder bells will ring.  Though on the other hand, an angel will get his wings.", "They wanted one with the baby's name so I'm almost sure that they would be upset", "I see your getting a lot of downvotes but i agree with you thinking on the blanket. I don\u2019t get why the blanket couldn\u2019t be 95% done in a gender neutral color and add the name once it was revealed?", "In the comments OP said they didn't want it without the name.", "the visual i have of you watching blood, guts & gore while furiously crocheting is hysterical. you sound fabulous.\n\nhope you feel better soon.", "The audacity to expect OP to take off work and do a rush job of a crocheted blanket in 3 days? I mean, really!", "Boom, for her gift, she taught them an important lesson. No need to make a blanket now.", "I was expecting to find out the baby was now a few years old and you just didn't make one because it was a boy and not a girl. Then I see what you wrote and oh my gosh!!! She's making normal level of entitled look bad. I can fully understand not giving the name until birth but then you should expect to either have a blanket with no name, or one but around the time the baby is 6 months to a year old. And that's only after asking nicely and being grateful!!! Then with your new diagnosis they should be telling you how terrible it is that you're going threw that and hope you find relief soon and to listen to the Dr, and not be worried about you making the blanket! \n\nUgh I'm mad for you,  NTA btw\n\nI have a relative who made a crochet blanket for my second child and it was so soft and just amazing that I wanted to steal it for myself (if only it was not so small and the newborn was not so attached to it lol). And because of how grateful I was for it, and knowing how much we used it, the same relative made another one for my next baby even though she had given up crocheting by then (she prefers other things to it, not due to hand issues). To say I was beyond happy to receive that gift would be an understatement. We were gifted quite a few things from family members for that baby but it's honestly 1 of 2 things I actually remember that she was given and by who.", "Couldn't she have trusted you to keep the baby's name a secret so that you could make the blanket ahead of time?  She's sounds very controlling.", "I\u2019d love to see that backfire\u2014 don\u2019t share the name because you\u2019re paranoid, and then someone else use it accidentally", "Thanks! I switched to hockey, which isn\u2019t really much different. Someone got a major earlier for drawing blood.", "AND controlling.", "Let's say it's a white blanket with a blue name. She would have to plan out the number/location of stitches to spell the name in blue. Then count the white stitches, and when she comes to part of a letter, change the yarn color to blue, do the stitches, then switch back to white.", "I'm a young(ish) person  (36) and I had to give up knitting in my 20s because it triggers the arthritis in my hands. Usually the arthritis isn't so bad but the control and dexterity needed to knit just flares me up. It's honestly very telling that DIL thinks you can just shit out a blanket for her. She's clearly never created anything with her hands or she'd know that there's a lot of skill involved and a 'rush job' isn't something she should be asking for.", "The only time I've ever been able to finish a blanket in a short amount  of time I was hyper fixated on crocheting and I used the big fluffy yarn meant for like finger crocheting. It went pretty fast, even making queen sized blankets, just because of how big the yarn was. My then boyfriend had to actually hand carve me a hook big enough to handle the yarn because the yarn store didn't have the right kind of hook. \n\nHe actually stabbed himself on accident with the box cutter he was using to carve with. Tried to fix it with gorilla glue but ended up needing to go to the ER for stitches after his homemade \"fix\" ripped open. I felt really bad then because it was pretty big injury (4 or 5 inches) and deep and he needed like 8 stitches. I feel less bad now considering he is a physically abusive transphobe and I am trans.", "I make baby blankets for almost all my friends (sorry babies born in the last year, y'all lost to my mental health), and I did one C2C. Never again. I can whip out a granny square baby blanket in a couple days but the C2C one took sooooo long.", "NTA. Crocheting takes time. It takes effort. \n\nIt would have been one thing to say \u201cwhat is the minimal time you need for the name, can you start on the rest\u201d or \u201cwife and I are dead serious that NO ONE finds out about the name. Can you keep it a secret\u201d\nBut no. They expected you to bend over backwards to accommodate them. \n\nCrocheting a blanket in a day? That\u2019s a massive strain on anyone\u2019s hands and wrists! Expecting you to take off work at the drop of the hat (or a baby lol) to put yourself into pain? Ridiculous. \n\nGift her some yarn and teach her some crochet so she can appreciate what she turned down.", "They should have told you with the understanding that nobody else was to know if they wanted the blanket made that badly. They will get over it. Nta", "NTA\n\n> they said I could just do a rush job later.\n\nEw, no ma\u2019am. They aren\u2019t so special they can demand a rush job, disregarding you might have other plans and obligations to work around.\n\n> my son's fianc\u00e9 was upset with me for not bringing the blanket when I first met my grandson as per tradition. \n\nThat tradition only worked when you were given adequate time to do the work - three days isn\u2019t it. \n\n> my son's fianc\u00e9 was hurt that I didn't care enough take off work to rush the blanket.\n\nExcuse me? This is absolutely not an acceptable request - you shouldn\u2019t have to take the hit to your paycheck to rush a blanket, especially when they were the ones that refused to give you the name.\n\nAlso that\u2019s a quick trip to a repetitive stress injury.\n\n> apparently, I'm a petty and passive-aggressive Mother-In-Law who's punishing them for not being told the name when I first asked\n\nYou aren\u2019t punishing them by not hurting yourself. No one should ever be asked to work through pain.\n\nI am so sorry they are angry at you for not being physically able to crochet at this point. I am sorry they appear to think you are lying about being in pain.\n\nI wonder if there are some other deep insecurities going on here.", "NTA I  am an avid crocheter, but it would take me weeks to make a baby blanket since I work and only have time to crochet an hour or so in the evenings. I also have a shoulder problem and sometimes can\u2019t work on my projects. Therefore I totally understand why you can\u2019t whip up a blanket in a couple of days when your son and his wife inconsiderately ignored your one request: to know the baby\u2019s name far enough in advance to do the blanket. Alas many people don\u2019t understand that our creations aren\u2019t made by elves while we sleep!", "NTA. They are entitled brats.", "NTA that was on them. My great-aunt made a beautiful quilt for my daughter that took so many hours and I love it so much. So did my daughter as a toddler. Anyone who understands how much time and effort hand crafted items can take, especially someone with dexterity issues, you would want to give them plenty of time to do the craft. If they wanted a blanket that badly, they could have given you the name and asked you to keep it quiet. But the whole \u201cstealing\u201d name thing is so dumb. No one owns a name. My daughter and her cousin look almost identical and have the same name because my cousin thought my daughter\u2019s name was beautiful and she was about to have her baby (the girls are about 4 months apart). I\u2019m glad she found the name beautiful and used it too. The girls don\u2019t care and actually enjoy that they both have red hair and the same name \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. It\u2019s a unique bond they get to have and I\u2019m glad they have it. I was named after a damn stray cat my mom adopted as a kid. So who cares where the name comes from as long as the baby is healthy.", "NTA", "I am literally astonished by the audacity.\n\nI've crocheted in the past and just following a pattern took considerable time.\n\nIf the name was incorporates solely with crochet, that's an immense amount of planning (i.e. no pattern)\n\nNTA", "Lol.\n\nI guess they think you're some kind of time-mage or something. \n\nThey could either tell you the name and get the quilt, or not, and not get the quilt. They chose the second. This was literally their decision. They're upset with you, because of their own decision.", "NTA but I also think you should give the daughter in law a bit of a break- pregnancy is stressful and people are always asking you intrusive questions and some things you just want to keep private. You could have been the 10th person to ask her for the baby\u2019s name that day and she just snapped. \n\nHopefully you can do something else to show how special the baby is to you, and you can show some grace during this stressful adjustment period of being a new parent. \n\nDon\u2019t take what they\u2019re saying to heart, unless they were nasty before the pregnancy too. You never know how tough the birth/pregnancy is and can only guess.

I\u2019ll gift one without a name. I wouldn\u2019t rush it", "NTA\n\nThey played a stupid game, they win the stupid prize \n\nThere was nothing wrong with keeping the name secret, but they were assholes for expecting you to rush and should have been prepared for not getting the quilt on the same timetable as everyone else. \n\nYou can tell them the reason they aren\u2019t getting a quilt isn\u2019t because of the name, it\u2019s because of their entitled expectations regarding your time and abilities.", "NTA", "NTA, it takes time to make things like that and as a knitter i totally empathize. In regards to your hands, it's great you've seen an actual medical professional! Have they given you any suggestions around compression gloves?

I don\u2019t crochet but I do cross stitch and haven\u2019t been able to do so consistently for several years now due to my arthritis/lupus/fibromyalgia combo of health issues.  It truly is devastating to have your favorite hobby taken away from you, especially from arthritis.  It\u2019s one of those things you truly don\u2019t appreciate until it\u2019s gone.  And I\u2019m only 32.  I thought for sure I\u2019d have plenty more years to stitch. \n\nI\u2019m glad my mom wasn\u2019t as bad as the son and DIL when reacting to my informing my family that I would no longer be stitching things for other people outside of the pieces that had been \u201cpaid\u201d for my friend (we did a trade, cross stitch for massages) and a family sampler I had started as a gift for my in-laws.
