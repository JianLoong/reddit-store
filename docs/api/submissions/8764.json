He asked his younger siblings to do his chores for him because he was tired.\n\nHis younger sister said no, that him being tired wasn't her problem. His younger brother agreed to do it. Last night, when he came home, he would only share with his younger brother. His younger sister said that wasn't fair, because she likes the restaurant food. My wife started to tell him to share, but before she could, I told him we need to let the kids work out their own conflicts (as long as everyone is safe) and not get involved.\n\nIn the end our oldest son didn't share with our daughter, and she was very upset. She refused to eat dinner, saying that the food her mother and I made was \"gross.\" My wife said I was an asshole and encouraging our son to dangle the privileges of his age over his sibling's heads.

She needs to learn a thing or two about misdirected anger and its consequences.", "NTA. No one is entitled to his leftovers. They're his leftovers, he paid for them, and he gets to decide who gets them, if anyone. If he wants to use them as payback for (normal, everyday) favors, like chores, then that's his prerogative.\n\nIt also doesn't help your wife's case any that your daughter was incredibly rude in her refusal. It's not her problem he's tired? Well, it's not his problem she's hungry.", "NTA.\n\n>His younger sister said that wasn't fair, because she likes the restaurant food.\n\nWhat have likes and dislikes to do with fair?

It's disappointing how quick people are to call child they never met entitled or brat.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter calling your food gross because she didn't get what she wanted shouldn't be getting restaurant food for a while.\n\nAlso, while she is correct it wasn't her problem, she also doesn't get the payment for doing her sibling a solid.", "NTA.  He worked to earn the leftovers.  Younger brother stepped up to help him.   Sounds like a good lesson for your daughter.", "NTA. I'm not a fan of forced sharing of anything (including toys). It's great if kids want to share voluntarily, but for things that belong to them, why should they have to give it to someone else?  If your oldest is old enough to work, it sounds like he's old enough to make this choice for himself.", "Info: how do you feel about one of your kids in effect paying another one of your kids to do chores? No judgement - I know some parents who champion this (they think it\u2019s a great natural economics lesson) and others who abhor it (they think chores are chores for a reason, and the point is not the work itself getting done). \n\nAnyway, NTA, but you and your wife need to get on the same page asap.", "NTA. Your son wasn't \"dangl\\[ing\\] the privileges of his age.\" He was dangling the privileges of his labor. Those are two completely different things. Q*uid pro quo* is a part of life. Your son asked his sister for the favor of doing his chores. She didn't want to, and that's ok. Your son brought home leftovers and his sister wanted some. He didn't want to share, and that's ok, too. \n\nGoing forward, I'd try to empower your daughter. What can she do to increase her bargaining strength or weaken your son's power? For example, can she learn to make a dinner as good as the restaurant food? (I suspect the answer is \"yes\" as cooking isn't that hard.)", "I feel like overall this is a NTA. I don't think your eldest was wrong to only share with your younger son when he helped him with his chores.\n\nI am a little unsure about him not wanting to do his chores due to working late at his job. It's inherently unfair for him to prioritise his paying job over his share of the household upkeep, then foist his chores on younger siblings. He gets his pay, and doesn't have to do the chores his siblings then have to pick up for him, and he gets to pick and choose who to share with. I wouldn't say it was unfair to adjust what he's expected to do if he is also working, but if he has his chores he should be doing them.\n\nYour daughter, however, seems like she kind of let herself in for it. Acting like your cooking was disgusting and telling your eldest it's not her problem that he's tired just seems really entitled. It's no wonder he didn't want to share things with her when she's been uncaring towards him.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like your daughter is becoming entitled. You and your wife should really talk to her and help change this behavior before it gets worse", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't say how young your daughter is, but the more important detail IMO is that you're allowing your son to develop a level of autonomy. He doesn't have to bring leftovers home. If he chooses to, he deserves to have some control over who he shares with. He's working, earning money, and spending some of it on food. You were right to stop your wife from insisting he share them equally with everyone.\n\nIf your wife had her way, she would have given him an object lesson on why it might be preferable in his eyes to throw his leftovers away rather than bring them home.\n\nJust like doing your son's chores was not your daughter's problem, your daughter preferring restaurant food over homemade is not your son's problem to solve.\n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA you're teaching them conflict resolution. Valuable life skill to have especially when they're older. \n\nDid you take the time to talk with your daughter afterwards and explain why her brother wouldn't share?", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nHe works for the food he takes home and does everyone a favour by sharing. He asked for a favour and got a negative response. So he's just cutting back on the favours he does. \nYou are right, or your wife and you have to compensate him for the food.", "NTA...You're setting them up to be better adults. I hope your daughter learned something.", "NTA.   Your working son is absolutely right here.  Sharing his leftovers from work is not an obligation.  If some siblings help him with chores and others don't he has every right to share with some and not others.\n\nYou and your wife need to be on the same page though, so the kids don't end up picking sides with you.  A united front is important. \n\nYour daughter also sounds entitled. She has no right to the son's food, and to complain that the dinner you guys made her was \"gross\" is unacceptable behavior and she needs to be held accountable.", "NTA\n\nYou are right, this was **DEFINITELY** a situation you should let them work out on their own.  Your younger children made up their own minds, and one received a payment for helping their older sibling.  Seems totally fair.", "NTA but you need to check your daughter's attitude and sit her down and teach her an important life lesson - sharing is caring.\n\nYour daughter should have shared the chores burden seeing how tired her brother is and that he brings food home to share even though he doesn't have to.\n\nAlso, her tantrum shows she is self centered and entitled. I would not tolerate her calling my food gross.", "NTA, this should be a learning a experience for her", "NTA. Your daughter is acting very entitled.", "Nta, his age isnt a privelage. In my opinion, the oldest has a job and school. And then hes coming home expected to do chores, AND share his meal? First off. What a great kid!  The younger brother seeing his brothers hard work and realizing he can also \"profit\" by helping his brother, again smart and what a good kid!\n\nLittle sister sounds like shes kinda spoiled. As a mom, i kinda get it. But they have to learn that you cant always get what you want just because you want it.\n\nRead her the little red hen. The story about the hen who plants the wheat, waters it, turn it to flour and keeps asking Cat, Pig, and Duck for help but they wont. But they want some bread when shes done and says no because they didnt help. \n\nTheres a time and place where sharing absolutely should be taught but this isnt that situation. This is a you gotta earn some rewards situation.", "NTA, youngest helped so youngest was given food. The daughter behaving this way is appalling", "NTA. Good parenting move. Your wife WHBTA if she had made him share food that was meant as a thank-you to his younger brother for helping him out, with his younger sister who had refused to help him.

Your daughter is learning the valuable lesson of FAFO.", "NTA - teaching a good lesson", "NTA that\u2019s just good parenting my dude.", "NTA - this notion that kids HAVE to share that our parents raised us with is completely toxic... as an adult do you HAVE to share your lunch with a co worker?  It's always NICE to share... and if you don't share you can't expect people to share with you... but you don't HAVE to.  There's pros and cons to sharing and learning that early in life is good for kids.  It's how my wife and I are choosing to raise our kids... and honestly it was hard at first, but now that they are starting to understand boundaries and consequences they're sharing of their own accord more often.", "NTA. Great job being a parent. Too many kids are coddled by their parents.", "NTA - your daughter sounds a bit entitled.  Consequences are Consequences.  It was his food to decide what to do with.  Her reaction was abhorrent.  I can't believe she thought she could act that way.  Teenage years are brutal.", "You are right and your wife is wrong.  It\u2019s not dangling age.

My brothers and I would do this type of stuff all the time and it would encourage the rest of us to help out so we get cool stuff too.", "NTA, as others have pointed out it's a good example of how when you help out, you can get rewarded. If it happened just as you wrote and your son asked his siblings kindly to help him out, and it isn't a regular thing, your daughter was being a brat. I'm sorry your wife reacted that way because the rule we had growing up was that if you don't want to eat what was made, you don't eat. My wife doesn't exactly agree, but we have pretty good kids and avoid making things we know they don't like. \n\nGood luck with this.", "[removed]", "Info - What are the ages at play here?", "NTA, it\u2019s solid lesson unless your wife undermines you in front of the kids.", "NTA fair does not mean equal and that\u2019s exactly the situation to reinforce this", "NTA\nIt is her choice to decide if she wants to help her brother when he is tired or not. On the other hand it's your son's choice to share the food he brings with her or not.\nAlso maybe talk to her and let her know how calling the food you made gross is disrespectful. I guess with this attitude she needs someone to tell her this is not the way to treat parents.", "NTA. Your son is working and has a perk of the job. He's chosen to compensate the person who helped him with his chores with that perk. Your daughter had the opportunity to help, refused so no food.\nYour son had set a precedent that food was obligation free by being nice and letting everyone have some. But he earned that food and so his choice each time. That's fair. Daughter should have taken a lesson from that. Not appealed to you to override him.", "NTA. Her finding the food your wife cooked is not HIS problem either.", "NTA", "I don't know that anyone is an AH yet. If your son consistently asks his siblings to pick up his chores slack so he can earn extra money I think it becomes a problem. He is earning money for working more, but that shouldn't mean that he isn't also responsible for his share of chores. I think it would be a good idea to have a conversation with all the kids about entitlement and expectations about chores. Sharing should be voluntary, helping each other should also be voluntary. If there's a power imbalance within kids it gets ugly quick.", "NTA it's weird that your wife called the food he brings home from working as a privilege of age pretty much negating his work efforts. I like the sentiment of letting your children sort out their own problems, that's a powerful lesson, they can be petty and aren't always fair but that's part of growing up and will allow them to grow their interpersonal relationships on equal footing. Your daughter isn't experiencing a great injustice by missing out on restaurant food, your eldest isn't wielding any supremacy from asking his siblings for a pass and rewarding the one that does. No need for parental intervention.", "NTA. That food is your oldest boys food. He can share or not share if he wants just like daughter was free to say no to him after he asked her for a favor. Your daughter played a stupid game and received her stupid prize: nothing. Next time, perhaps the young lady might say sure when asked for a favor.", "NTA - I know it\u2019s not her problem and it\u2019s his choice to work.

Your oldest is entering a new world where responsibility has it's rewards and punishment.  He worked and earned his share of food he brought home, no one else including you as a father and the mother let alone the kids. He does this regularly from what I read. The issue was that he was tired, I get tired too, rewarding someone for helping you is not a bad thing.  Yes the daughter felt entitled to the food but that was an insult to the mother by saying her food was gross, not against the oldest.   The son that helped his brother out when he was tired is an awesome thing to see, and then the brother shares his food that he worked for when he gets home as a thank you is a good lesson. That tactic can grow their relationship with time and make new friends in that same way in life.\n  Outside of family if your son did that same routine and it was another adult complaining of not getting restaurant food while having a homemade meal by their mother, I would call that person selfish and entitled.", "Where was your wife when older son worked late, and his sister would not help?", "[deleted]", "NTA - I like the way it was handled.

That's not a good precedent to set for him. No matter how long or tiring his day was, his chores are still his responsibility. I would have been fine with it if he asked for a little more time, or if he had asked others to do it in exchange for something else, but the way this went down sounds like he wanted your daughter to do something for nothing in return, then he \"punished\" her for not doing something out of the kindness of her heart by denying her a treat she normally wouldn't have to \"pay\" for by doing a chore. That's retaliatory and while she was never entitled to the food in the first place, she also didn't know he would suddenly take the extra treat away because she didn't do him a favor earlier. While she does need to learn that she isn't entitled to his kindness, especially if she's not going to show it in return, I can also understand why, to her, this situation seemed unfair, because before she didn't have to do extra chores to get the treat and the situation changed without her knowledge. Your son also needs to learn that overextendeing himself outside the home doesn't absolve him from responsibilities at home. Both of you could also remind your daughter that he normally gives the food out of his own kindness and that returning the favor would have been a good thing to do on her part.

It actually is a reasonable opportunity for a valuable life lesson IMO, because it's really not that high stakes and it's a pretty clear correlation.\n\nHe was tired from working long hours at what is likely a pretty physically grueling job. Most/many restaurant jobs can be physically grueling in various ways to varying degrees (it of course also varies from place to place, day by day, etc), but bussing is typically constant movement with heavy lifting.

So he could avoid more physical work after being exhausted by a very physical job, if possible. I'm assuming she was not unwell or unable to help him with the chores, as she said it \"wasn't her problem\" and I'd imagine any extenuating circumstances would've been used as better justification if she had it. That not being her problem may be technically true, I guess. Regardless, it's not like she was forced to do anything or eventually helped out.

I said my perspective was informed by my background and circumstances, where it would be extremely privileged to be able to afford to pay someone because you couldn't be bothered to do housework.\n\nTeaching an older child they can fob their chores off on other siblings is a bad lesson in my view, because it teaches them at as soon as you leave the house to do work, work in the home is something to be avoided.", "First I don\u2019t think he should be forced to share. He initially brought home the food for everyone and enjoyed sharing it as a family. It became a ritual and part of their relationship with no expectations of anything in return.

He changed the terms of the gesture and without a warning. Also he waited until she was excited about it at the table so she can sit there and watch everyone else eat. This is manipulative. There\u2019s other ways to express anger and hurt feelings.\n\nEdit: I pointed out she\u2019s an AH too. Back to your coworker example.

She tried to manipulate older brother into feeling bad for her and caving.  There are other ways she could have expressed anger and hurt feelings.\n4. What should son have done?  Refused to bring food home?  That's still \"manipulative\" because he's punishing sister by your standards.  Share with her and then just cross his fingers that she helps him next time?  good luck with that.  Tell her - \"if you don't help me, I'm not going to share\" - is mom really going to stand for that?

You keep missing that part and writing paragraphs about her. As well as I said he isn\u2019t required to share. Also not treating this as a requirement to feeding her, it seems like a treat to me. I used your work example to point out how it was manipulative so you could see the parallel. \n\nI assumed he enjoyed sharing because he did it over and over and sounds like he voluntarily shared. The post would probably have mentioned an ongoing argument about sharing the food otherwise. Usually you have the option of eating at the restaurant after shift, which I figured he would do if he felt like he couldn\u2019t say no.

They expect food that they want to be given to them.

She refused to eat dinner, saying that the food her mother and I made was \"gross.\" My wife said I was an asshole and encouraging our son to dangle the privileges of his age over his sibling's heads. I think it was a good lesson on how doing nice this for others pays off in the end, personally.*\n\nIf your son is working, he is an older teen and you know what- he doesn't have to share anything with his younger siblings (especially since this is one of the benefits of him working). He shared with his younger brother as a way of thanking him for helping him out. His sister refused to so she doesn't get to share in the bounty. You need to talk to your daughter and have her apologize for her comments about the food. Tell her that sometimes you should do favors for family not for the benefits that you might  receive (so that she doesn't start helping her brother only because she can get food) but because it is a nice thing to do. If she were sick or tired, would she not want her brothers to do her chores?", "NTA \n\nyour daughter is disgusting. she refuses to help out, wants free food, then disparages the effort her parents put to prepare food? and you are defending her? come on. i see where the problem stems from.", "NTA. The older son asked for help with chores and sister said no. Brother helped. When older son got some food to bring home, he remembered brother was helpful. Sister was not. \n\nA kindness is remembered. That's the way life works. Good lesson for sister.", "NTA. Best you get that entitled behaviour out of her now or else she will be living under your roof forever acting like that.", "NTA but also if people want to call out your daughter for being on the road to being an entitled little monster, they have that right. Any daughter saying the food I cooked her was 'gross'?  And you TOLERATE that?  \n\nGood gravy, you deserve what you get with her.", "Agree.  NTA, and you're completely right about one hand washing the other.\n\nI teach my children that there are chores that are mandatory, chores that are optional, and a price to their labor.  Kids should face the consequences of their actions in real time, and this is about as risk-free a consequence as it gets.  If a sibling asks for help and they say no, well, they might have gotten out of extra work- but any reward for saying yes and helping is gone as well. The daughter has no right to his property and the way he wants to split it, and frankly, I'm kind of appalled at her gall. \n\nAnd for those who say that the reward wasn't disclosed first:  I ask for help with things all the time, and it's a rare occasion that I disclose a thank-you reward for their help.  Sure, I've been part of a few quid pro quo's, but sometimes, you just ask for help because you need help.  And later in the day, you think to yourself \"Hey- they went out of their way to help me, and I'm going to do something nice in return.\" \n\nYour son didn't offer it to the table and leave her out; he offered it to his brother, who did him a favor.  Or maybe he did it to rub it in her face for not helping him out, who knows.  It was a reward or petty revenge, but either way, she's the one who said \"...him being tired wasn't \\[her\\] problem,\" so her attitude is not his problem either.", "That's a good point. Though he is the eldest, so I assume he started doing chores before his younger siblings had to do them / now picking bigger chores. I'm not saying he should be free from doing any chores but that they could look into adjusting the schedule and type of chores a bit?\nAfter all it's natural progression to then start doing a job and do chores at other times due to that?\n\nDunno just a thought tbh", "> It's inherently unfair for him to prioritise his paying job over his share of the household upkeep,\n\nWhy?\n\nSounds like he's a teenager and a paying job can be a pretty important part of the development and learning for a young brain. (not to mention, if he has to save up for post secondary education, it's a necessity) \n\nBy virtue of being older and having a job he has less free time to do the chores than his siblings who have fewer responsibilities, asking them ONCE to help him out when he's been working is hardly an example of him not contributing to the household. In healthy, adult dynamics people help pick up each others slack in times of need because they care about each other and know that the load and love gets shared in other ways. Ex. If my partner has a busy period at work and is working more hours than usual I may do more of the cooking and cleaning during that time because I know they'll do the same for me when I'm busy.

I don't need anything in return.\" then it's good to go. \n\nWhile the 11 year old being mouthy about the cooking does need to be addressed, so too does the eldest's approach towards getting his sibling to pick up his slack.

I lived in a coop house in college where everyone was assigned a week to do chores. If you skipped your week, you had to pay a hefty fine to the house, which got distributed to the people who picked up your slack. One girl thought chores were beneath her and a distraction for the more important things she had going on (getting straight A\u2019s, multiple internships), so she had her parents pay the fine every time. But that\u2019s going against the spirit of the chores in the first place \u2014 the fine was meant to be a deterrent, not tender for paid services.

Why punish Person A for having the good luck of getting to split the money? \n\nHeinrich continued the experiment in other regions, and found several African tribes who would reject the offer it it was *too high*, as these were cultures with values of gift economy, meaning that accepting a gift places a social obligation to later provide equal assistance to the original gifter. \n\nAnyway thanks for letting me rant, this is one of my favorite examples of the importance of repeatability and sample selection in scientific experiments.", "He had been doing a nice thing for her.

He was still taking care of his responsibility to supply a warm body for the army, but he wasn't taking that burden onto himself.  Instead he was just using his money (an advantage the poor man couldn't access) to offload his responsibility onto someone else.\n\nIf you and I are roommates and we can both pay for a cleaner, and you choose to pay but I choose to clean myself, then that's a free choice each of us is making.

Learning now will save her a harder time down the road, and it also teaches your son that you, as parents, respect that he has ownership of the things he has earned. Including food from his job.

If the 7yr old refuses to go down with the 12 year old when he asks, I don't force the 12 year old to go down with the 7 year old when he refuses the next time she goes down. However if they choose to help each another life is easier. They willingly help each another with chores and share rewards. They learned quickly the work gets done faster if they work together.

Or can he just not give her food for a week until she starts doing his chores again? If you allow this system to go on, I would formalize it or you're going to have issues down the line.

That was the consequence of choosing to work longer hours. The money he made from working extra hours only benefits him. It\u2019s important for a teenage boy to learn that he cannot just foist off his domestic responsibilities onto his other family members simply because he is tired. He won\u2019t be able to do so as an adult without being TAH. People want to compare this situation to paying for maid services, but those decisions are made in advance of a conflict. This is more akin to a husband and father claiming that he is too tired to handle domestic responsibilities. \n\nIt\u2019s also important for an 11 year-old girl to learn to say no to men and boys in her life trying to foist their domestic work into her. \n\nYour wife is right: Your daughter is too young to work. She can\u2019t obtain money or goods the same way. It\u2019s fine for your son to stop sharing with anyone. It\u2019s not fine for him to convert an act of generosity into a required payment without communication. Your daughter reached the reasonable conclusion that your son didn\u2019t want to do his chores because he wanted to make money and opted not to cover his shirking of domestic responsibilities. Your son has converted his former generosity into a method of controlling his siblings. After all, there was no logical connection between the chores and the food.

Many, many other women (and other people) have also.  It's not fun.

She can learn an unjustified sense of entitlement from this if that isn't conveyed, and there are certainly ways she could permanently damage her relationship with her brother if that attitude is encouraged.)\n\nYour wife is definitely TA for thinking you handled it incorrectly, and for wanting to force your son to share. His income and benefits don't belong to his siblings, and teaching them that they're entitled to it would be absolutely disrespectful. It also devalues his work by forcing him to give up something he earned--it's a great way to destroy his work ethic.\n\nBut I also feel like she hasn't considered the consequences of her perspective. In his place, most people would come up with a pretty obvious resolution that takes it out your wife's hands: they'll eat the leftovers before heading home from work, and neither sibling will get any. The youngest would likely resent both the sister and mother for that, especially if the brother explains why he stopped bringing leftovers home. \n\nAnd inevitably, your wife escalates out of anger that her power was undermined, and you end up with a scenario where the kid eventually goes LC or NC because of his entitled parent who can't respect boundaries and can't respect that his property isn't hers to preside over.\n\nNTA.", "This.\nThis. \nThis. \n\nHe\u2019s teaching his daughter to ACCEPT this treatment as well.

But would you really be a doormat and continue to provide that benefit after they refused to offer a relatively easy accommodation on a rough day? \n\nMost people wouldn't; most people would recognize that they're being taken advantage of in that scenario. Most people would ask you why you're still providing an unnecessary benefit to someone who doesn't appreciate it. \n\nAnd importantly, most people wouldn't interpret your behavior as manipulative if you stopped bringing donuts--you've just received information that warrants reassessing whether it's appropriate to go above and beyond in kindness or not.

And it seems like that was what was normal in this family as well. \n\nTo me it is NOT in the normal order of things for a younger sibling to do an older sibling\u2019s chores as a random favour because he is tired.

OP's son *volunteered* for an extra shift (for his own benefit), it wasn't imposed on him, and he wasn't too busy to do his chores, he had just tired himself out with the extra work he imposed upon himself.

There were no assholes in this scenario. He sounds like a nice brother especially with how he rewarded his own brother for helping him out. But he went about it the wrong way by deliberately excluding his sister as if to prove a point. He knew it would upset her, and perhaps that's part of the lesson he wanted to teach.

The little red hen cuts it down.*\r  \n*\u201cWho can help me make flour?\u201d she asks.*\r  \n*\u201cNot I,\u201d says the orange cat.*\r  \n*\u201cNot I,\u201d says the yellow duck.*\r  \n*\u201cNot I,\u201d says the white sheep.*\r  \n*\u201cI can make flour all by myself,\u201d she says.*\r  \n*\u201cWho can help me bake bread?\u201d the little red hen asks.*\r  \n*\u201cNot I,\u201d says the orange cat.*\r  \n*\u201cNot I,\u201d says the yellow duck.*\r  \n*\u201cNot I,\u201d says the white sheep.*\r  \n*\u201cI can bake it all by myself,\u201d she says.*\r  \n*\u201cWho can help me eat the bread?\u201d the little red hen asks.*\r  \n*\u201cI can,\u201d says the orange cat.*\r  \n*\u201cI can,\u201d says the yellow duck.*\r  \n*\u201cI can,\u201d says the white sheep*\r  \n*\u201cNo, thanks. I can eat it all by myself,\u201d she says.*", "Eh 11 year old was mad. By the time dad's tucking her into bed she will be ready to talk and actually learn from the teachable moment. As another said she needs time to process on her own before they discuss it. Plus discussing things in private is much easier for kids that age to actually hear you.\n\nEta NTA", "I feel like things change a lot depending on the size of the pool of participants you drew from.\n\nSomeone from a large city splitting money with a stranger is going to think completely differently from a person in a small village splitting money with someone they see all the time.\n\n\"Let's see, Ralph let me borrow his lawnmower last week, his sister is married to my cousin, his wife and my wife are meeting up to cook something next week...\"", "rofl I still have and use a manual can opener.  Electric can openers aren't popular or common in my country, and it's about half and half with the pull top cans right now.", "It needs to be spelled out because an 11yo doesn't have the thinking ability of someone older like her 16yo brother or an adult, 11yo's are still emotionally immature, and OPs daughter probably thought along the lines of \"I've already done my chores, I don't want to do his too\" which, fair enough but when brother refused to share she's not thinking \"well I did refuse to help him out, plus he's not obligated to share\", like any child her age she's thinking \"but that's not fair!\". \n\nKids can sometimes need reminders of stories like the Little Red Hen, or sometimes put themselves in the other person's shoes like\n\n\"say you were kind to your brother by sharing your snacks with him whenever he didn't have any, then one day you're unwell and unable to do your chores and you ask him 'would you be able to do my chores for me today, I don't feel well' and your brother responded 'no, it's not my problem you're not feeling well'? Yes, like you he had a right to say no, but would you want to share your snacks with him again if he was so rude to you and refused to return your kindness with kindness?\". \n\nWhile a lesson like this would be obvious to those of us as adults who have already learned this, an 11yo is still a child, you can't expect a child to think like an adult or have the self awareness of an adult.", "Not for the judgement itself but for everyone's added advice about what to do moving forward.\n\nIf he eats it before coming home it would probably be better because then there isn't always comparison but also after working going home is the first thing a lot of people want to do."]}
