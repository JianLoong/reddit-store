He came home and didn't want to do his Sunday chores. He asked his younger siblings to do his chores for him because he was tired.\n\nHis younger sister said no, that him being tired wasn't her problem. His younger brother agreed to do it. Last night, when he came home, he would only share with his younger brother. His younger sister said that wasn't fair, because she likes the restaurant food. My wife started to tell him to share, but before she could, I told him we need to let the kids work out their own conflicts (as long as everyone is safe) and not get involved.\n\nIn the end our oldest son didn't share with our daughter, and she was very upset. She refused to eat dinner, saying that the food her mother and I made was \"gross.\" My wife said I was an asshole and encouraging our son to dangle the privileges of his age over his sibling's heads.

She needs to learn a thing or two about misdirected anger and its consequences.", "NTA. No one is entitled to his leftovers. They're his leftovers, he paid for them, and he gets to decide who gets them, if anyone. If he wants to use them as payback for (normal, everyday) favors, like chores, then that's his prerogative.\n\nIt also doesn't help your wife's case any that your daughter was incredibly rude in her refusal. It's not her problem he's tired? Well, it's not his problem she's hungry.", "NTA.\n\n>His younger sister said that wasn't fair, because she likes the restaurant food.\n\nWhat have likes and dislikes to do with fair? She needs to have 'fairness' and 'entitlement' explained to her.", "NTA\n\nAnd it sounds like your working son is NTA as well. The sister said his being tired was not her problem.

It's disappointing how quick people are to call child they never met entitled or brat.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter calling your food gross because she didn't get what she wanted shouldn't be getting restaurant food for a while.\n\nAlso, while she is correct it wasn't her problem, she also doesn't get the payment for doing her sibling a solid.", "NTA.  He worked to earn the leftovers.  Younger brother stepped up to help him.   Sounds like a good lesson for your daughter.", "NTA. I'm not a fan of forced sharing of anything (including toys). It's great if kids want to share voluntarily, but for things that belong to them, why should they have to give it to someone else?  If your oldest is old enough to work, it sounds like he's old enough to make this choice for himself.", "Info: how do you feel about one of your kids in effect paying another one of your kids to do chores? No judgement - I know some parents who champion this (they think it\u2019s a great natural economics lesson) and others who abhor it (they think chores are chores for a reason, and the point is not the work itself getting done). \n\nAnyway, NTA, but you and your wife need to get on the same page asap.", "NTA. Your son wasn't \"dangl\\[ing\\] the privileges of his age.\" He was dangling the privileges of his labor. Those are two completely different things. Q*uid pro quo* is a part of life. Your son asked his sister for the favor of doing his chores. She didn't want to, and that's ok. Your son brought home leftovers and his sister wanted some. He didn't want to share, and that's ok, too. \n\nGoing forward, I'd try to empower your daughter. What can she do to increase her bargaining strength or weaken your son's power? For example, can she learn to make a dinner as good as the restaurant food? (I suspect the answer is \"yes\" as cooking isn't that hard.)", "I feel like overall this is a NTA. I don't think your eldest was wrong to only share with your younger son when he helped him with his chores.\n\nI am a little unsure about him not wanting to do his chores due to working late at his job. It's inherently unfair for him to prioritise his paying job over his share of the household upkeep, then foist his chores on younger siblings. He gets his pay, and doesn't have to do the chores his siblings then have to pick up for him, and he gets to pick and choose who to share with. I wouldn't say it was unfair to adjust what he's expected to do if he is also working, but if he has his chores he should be doing them.\n\nYour daughter, however, seems like she kind of let herself in for it. Acting like your cooking was disgusting and telling your eldest it's not her problem that he's tired just seems really entitled. It's no wonder he didn't want to share things with her when she's been uncaring towards him.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like your daughter is becoming entitled. You and your wife should really talk to her and help change this behavior before it gets worse", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't say how young your daughter is, but the more important detail IMO is that you're allowing your son to develop a level of autonomy. He doesn't have to bring leftovers home. If he chooses to, he deserves to have some control over who he shares with. He's working, earning money, and spending some of it on food. You were right to stop your wife from insisting he share them equally with everyone.\n\nIf your wife had her way, she would have given him an object lesson on why it might be preferable in his eyes to throw his leftovers away rather than bring them home.\n\nJust like doing your son's chores was not your daughter's problem, your daughter preferring restaurant food over homemade is not your son's problem to solve.\n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA you're teaching them conflict resolution. Valuable life skill to have especially when they're older. \n\nDid you take the time to talk with your daughter afterwards and explain why her brother wouldn't share?", "NTA looks like your daughter\u2019s more of a brat", "NTA\n\nHe works for the food he takes home and does everyone a favour by sharing. He asked for a favour and got a negative response. So he's just cutting back on the favours he does. \nYou are right, or your wife and you have to compensate him for the food.", "NTA...You're setting them up to be better adults. I hope your daughter learned something.", "NTA.   Your working son is absolutely right here.  Sharing his leftovers from work is not an obligation.  If some siblings help him with chores and others don't he has every right to share with some and not others.\n\nYou and your wife need to be on the same page though, so the kids don't end up picking sides with you.  A united front is important. \n\nYour daughter also sounds entitled. She has no right to the son's food, and to complain that the dinner you guys made her was \"gross\" is unacceptable behavior and she needs to be held accountable.", "NTA\n\nYou are right, this was **DEFINITELY** a situation you should let them work out on their own.  Your younger children made up their own minds, and one received a payment for helping their older sibling.  Seems totally fair.", "NTA but you need to check your daughter's attitude and sit her down and teach her an important life lesson - sharing is caring.\n\nYour daughter should have shared the chores burden seeing how tired her brother is and that he brings food home to share even though he doesn't have to.\n\nAlso, her tantrum shows she is self centered and entitled. I would not tolerate her calling my food gross.", "NTA, this should be a learning a experience for her", "NTA. Your daughter is acting very entitled.", "Nta, his age isnt a privelage. In my opinion, the oldest has a job and school. And then hes coming home expected to do chores, AND share his meal? First off. What a great kid!  The younger brother seeing his brothers hard work and realizing he can also \"profit\" by helping his brother, again smart and what a good kid!\n\nLittle sister sounds like shes kinda spoiled. As a mom, i kinda get it. But they have to learn that you cant always get what you want just because you want it.\n\nRead her the little red hen. The story about the hen who plants the wheat, waters it, turn it to flour and keeps asking Cat, Pig, and Duck for help but they wont. But they want some bread when shes done and says no because they didnt help. \n\nTheres a time and place where sharing absolutely should be taught but this isnt that situation. This is a you gotta earn some rewards situation.", "NTA, youngest helped so youngest was given food. The daughter behaving this way is appalling", "NTA. Good parenting move. Your wife WHBTA if she had made him share food that was meant as a thank-you to his younger brother for helping him out, with his younger sister who had refused to help him. Contrary to your daughter's beliefs, this was fair. Your daughter is learning the valuable lesson of FAFO.", "NTA - teaching a good lesson", "NTA that\u2019s just good parenting my dude.", "NTA - this notion that kids HAVE to share that our parents raised us with is completely toxic... as an adult do you HAVE to share your lunch with a co worker?  It's always NICE to share... and if you don't share you can't expect people to share with you... but you don't HAVE to.  There's pros and cons to sharing and learning that early in life is good for kids.  It's how my wife and I are choosing to raise our kids... and honestly it was hard at first, but now that they are starting to understand boundaries and consequences they're sharing of their own accord more often.", "NTA. Great job being a parent. Too many kids are coddled by their parents.", "NTA - your daughter sounds a bit entitled.  Consequences are Consequences.  It was his food to decide what to do with.  Her reaction was abhorrent.  I can't believe she thought she could act that way.  Teenage years are brutal.", "You are right and your wife is wrong.  It\u2019s not dangling age.

My brothers and I would do this type of stuff all the time and it would encourage the rest of us to help out so we get cool stuff too.", "NTA, as others have pointed out it's a good example of how when you help out, you can get rewarded. If it happened just as you wrote and your son asked his siblings kindly to help him out, and it isn't a regular thing, your daughter was being a brat. I'm sorry your wife reacted that way because the rule we had growing up was that if you don't want to eat what was made, you don't eat. My wife doesn't exactly agree, but we have pretty good kids and avoid making things we know they don't like. \n\nGood luck with this.", "[removed]", "Info - What are the ages at play here?", "NTA, it\u2019s solid lesson unless your wife undermines you in front of the kids.", "NTA fair does not mean equal and that\u2019s exactly the situation to reinforce this", "NTA\nIt is her choice to decide if she wants to help her brother when he is tired or not. On the other hand it's your son's choice to share the food he brings with her or not.\nAlso maybe talk to her and let her know how calling the food you made gross is disrespectful. I guess with this attitude she needs someone to tell her this is not the way to treat parents.", "NTA. Your son is working and has a perk of the job. He's chosen to compensate the person who helped him with his chores with that perk. Your daughter had the opportunity to help, refused so no food.\nYour son had set a precedent that food was obligation free by being nice and letting everyone have some. But he earned that food and so his choice each time. That's fair. Daughter should have taken a lesson from that. Not appealed to you to override him.", "NTA. Her finding the food your wife cooked is not HIS problem either.", "NTA", "I don't know that anyone is an AH yet. If your son consistently asks his siblings to pick up his chores slack so he can earn extra money I think it becomes a problem. He is earning money for working more, but that shouldn't mean that he isn't also responsible for his share of chores. I think it would be a good idea to have a conversation with all the kids about entitlement and expectations about chores. Sharing should be voluntary, helping each other should also be voluntary. If there's a power imbalance within kids it gets ugly quick.", "NTA it's weird that your wife called the food he brings home from working as a privilege of age pretty much negating his work efforts. I like the sentiment of letting your children sort out their own problems, that's a powerful lesson, they can be petty and aren't always fair but that's part of growing up and will allow them to grow their interpersonal relationships on equal footing. Your daughter isn't experiencing a great injustice by missing out on restaurant food, your eldest isn't wielding any supremacy from asking his siblings for a pass and rewarding the one that does. No need for parental intervention.", "NTA. That food is your oldest boys food. He can share or not share if he wants just like daughter was free to say no to him after he asked her for a favor. Your daughter played a stupid game and received her stupid prize: nothing. Next time, perhaps the young lady might say sure when asked for a favor.", "NTA - I know it\u2019s not her problem and it\u2019s his choice to work.

Your oldest is entering a new world where responsibility has it's rewards and punishment.  He worked and earned his share of food he brought home, no one else including you as a father and the mother let alone the kids. He does this regularly from what I read. The issue was that he was tired, I get tired too, rewarding someone for helping you is not a bad thing.  Yes the daughter felt entitled to the food but that was an insult to the mother by saying her food was gross, not against the oldest.   The son that helped his brother out when he was tired is an awesome thing to see, and then the brother shares his food that he worked for when he gets home as a thank you is a good lesson. That tactic can grow their relationship with time and make new friends in that same way in life.\n  Outside of family if your son did that same routine and it was another adult complaining of not getting restaurant food while having a homemade meal by their mother, I would call that person selfish and entitled.", "Where was your wife when older son worked late, and his sister would not help?", "[deleted]", "NTA - I like the way it was handled.

That's not a good precedent to set for him. No matter how long or tiring his day was, his chores are still his responsibility. I would have been fine with it if he asked for a little more time, or if he had asked others to do it in exchange for something else, but the way this went down sounds like he wanted your daughter to do something for nothing in return, then he \"punished\" her for not doing something out of the kindness of her heart by denying her a treat she normally wouldn't have to \"pay\" for by doing a chore. That's retaliatory and while she was never entitled to the food in the first place, she also didn't know he would suddenly take the extra treat away because she didn't do him a favor earlier. While she does need to learn that she isn't entitled to his kindness, especially if she's not going to show it in return, I can also understand why, to her, this situation seemed unfair, because before she didn't have to do extra chores to get the treat and the situation changed without her knowledge. Your son also needs to learn that overextendeing himself outside the home doesn't absolve him from responsibilities at home. Both of you could also remind your daughter that he normally gives the food out of his own kindness and that returning the favor would have been a good thing to do on her part.

It's not like he randomly decided not to share with her out of nowhere, while continuing to share with everyone else. Actions (or lack thereof) have consequences. I don't know their ages, so I don't want to be too brutal on the daughter, but it sounds like she's old enough that she should be able to understand the connection.. It actually is a reasonable opportunity for a valuable life lesson IMO, because it's really not that high stakes and it's a pretty clear correlation.\n\nHe was tired from working long hours at what is likely a pretty physically grueling job. Most/many restaurant jobs can be physically grueling in various ways to varying degrees (it of course also varies from place to place, day by day, etc), but bussing is typically constant movement with heavy lifting. Bussers don't typically interact with customers too much, but they still can't entirely escape the wrath of the crazier customers either. That can be emotionally exhausting for anyone and he's still a kid at his first job. Unless it was seriously dead (it was Sunday, so less likely that'd be the case at most restaurants), he probably worked quite hard. \n\nHe *asked* for help, there's nothing to suggest it was inherently *expected*. So he could avoid more physical work after being exhausted by a very physical job, if possible. I'm assuming she was not unwell or unable to help him with the chores, as she said it \"wasn't her problem\" and I'd imagine any extenuating circumstances would've been used as better justification if she had it. That not being her problem may be technically true, I guess. Regardless, it's not like she was forced to do anything or eventually helped out. Yet then she *expects* to be still treated to his food that he *earned* by working at said restaurant. Well, it's **not his problem**. \n\nThere's a fine balance on this sort of thing, but in this case I really think OP is NTA. His daughter is not being victimized from what I'm getting. I'm not judging her really. She's a kid and absolutely deserves compassion, but she'll have to learn eventually. Whether it's a conscious lesson or not, everyone does.", "I disagree.

At 11 (daughter's age) I was making whole meals like lasagna and fresh bread from scratch. \n\nShe is not entitled to the fruits of her brother's labor.

It's probably a poor habit to get into though. Sooner or later.", "Hey this might seem like a stupid question, but how would that be bad?

The concept of you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours is not only deeply ingrained in us but is the most satisfying when fairly balanced. We don't like doing too much or too little for others and tend to get rid of (or at least put very little effort into) relationships that are unbalanced.", "Okay, but if he's been sharing up until this point, and didn't bother to communicate that the food was directly tied to helping him, then a younger sibling will totally see it as a punishment for not doing extra chores. Like I said, the leftovers can be used a payment as long as that's communicated.", "As a kid who was parentified, it kind of sounds like you were too. It's definitely above and beyond what most would expect of an 11 year old to be baking fresh bread alone! But you are right that she's old enough to learn to make simple meals and definitely old enough to show respect to people feeding and treating her. Her attitude sucks.", "Yep, my kid would be fending for herself for dinner for a while if she called my food gross.

But regardless of whether it's a favor or a payment, they need to work out their own relationships with each other if they are going to have healthy and functional relationships as adults.", "It's not a problem. My brother paid me to do stuff for him when we were younger. It's what adults do all the time. Don't feel like doing laundry, hire a laundry service. Don't feel like cleaning, get a maid. Don't want to cook, get Door dash. It's called enterprising. Also it gives the younger siblings a way to earn cash when they can't get a job.", "I\u2019m inclined to agree. If he\u2019s working and pays or incentivizes his siblings to do his chores, what\u2019s the problem? Seems like everyone wins.

If he changes it to a pay system, that is a different dynamic between the siblings. It goes from a family helping each other and shares, and becomes a I got X if you want it do X for me. \n\n I see this time as fine because of the sister's attitude.  Hopefully, it will be a one-time learning lesson. If you are rude, do not expect favors from others.", "Re read and saw that after so I deleted and I agree", "That\u2019s unsustainable, and sooner than he knows, his siblings will be asking for more than he will be willing to give up. The OP and his wife need to set clear boundaries and expectations across the board. There should be one rule, and that\u2019s the parents rule.

Past tense.  \n\nMaybe he doesn't enjoy sharing with her anymore.  Maybe her attitude when (1) saying no (in a cold way) and then (2) demanding he share with her made it so it's no longer enjoyable to give her free food.  I certainly wouldn't enjoy coming home after a shift, feeling exhausted, and then sitting down and sharing with someone who  snapped at me and now feels entitled to the fruits of my labor.  He's not her parent.  He doesn't have to work to provide for her.", "It def is his choice not to give his food to someone who will be perfectly fed.", "Actually I wasn't. I was by my mom's side in the kitchen from the time I could walk and talk. I loved being in the kitchen. I learned to make bread (it's pretty easy) when I was 6 with my Mom. I wasn't allowed to bake by myself until I was 11. I was allowed to use the cooktop if a parent was in the kitchen by age 7. I honestly believe I have the best Mom in the world. She wanted me to have the life skills to take care myself, so she encouraged me in the kitchen. Plus I love feeding people and watching them enjoy my food.\n\nMy point is that at age 11, she is more than capable of learning how to cook. I know not all kids were like me.

I get that, because you\u2019ve said it multiple times. \n\nBut apparently your wife disagrees? \n\nIf so, **your opinion on the matter is only half the equation**. Half at best actually lol \n\nInstead of convincing us on Reddit that you\u2019re right, you need to converse with her in person and get on the same page. \n\nThis incident is nothing. A mini skirmish. But you and your wife being on the same page moving forward is everything.", "I feel like it's teaching him that as long as he says he's tired, he doesn't have to contribute around the house. He gets the benefit of his pay, and he doesn't have to take responsibility for the house because he works. \n\nThe other kids aren't his employees to pick up after him.\n\n>Don't feel like doing laundry, hire a laundry service.\n\nMaybe this is cultural difference, but in my house if I/my wife don't feel like doing the laundry, it doesn't get done. We don't have the option or funds to pay for a laundry service, which feels like a massive luxury to have that option (I was never brought up with that either).", "Eh, unsure there. Adults who earn money outsource chores all the time. \n\nIf he feels his time is more important than the time it would take to do the chore, then paying to have it done seems like an appropriate life lesson.", "I feel you might be looking at it too cynically.\n\nIt seems to me more like the older brother choosing to be kind and when asks for kindness in return is scorned. Why should he continue to offer the same kindness to the one who scorned him?", "He doesn\u2019t have to share it, but taking something and using it to get the other person do chores is manipulative. There were no strings attached to sharing before and he bait and switched her.", "I'm not trying to convince you. You asked me a question. I was just being polite and answering.", "Except he didn\u2019t demand they do his chores, he asked them if they would. Younger brother didn\u2019t have to agree to help. If he hadn\u2019t, then the oldest would have had to go on and do them, or face whatever consequences later of his chores not getting done. I just don\u2019t think one instance is enough to extrapolate this into a worrisome pattern.", "Just because you don\u2019t have that option doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong for others who do have that option to take it. You can\u2019t be possibly saying that because you can\u2019t afford it, then others shouldn\u2019t either?", "Buddy, I'm an adult and I pay someone to come clean my house sometimes because I'm too tired to for a long period of time. It's like $25/hr where I'm at, so it's no different than dinner for 2 at a cheap restaurant without alcohol. The natural consequences are that he has less money to have fun with.\n\nWe all have priorities in our budget, and it's up to them to figure out which priorities matter to them.", "There are 3 adults and 3 kids in my house. We have chore charts (one for adults and one for kids) and the basic rule is that you are responsible for your chore getting done but you don't have to be the one to do it, you can trade or ask for help (or pay a sibling) as long as it gets done.", "That's not what bait and switch means?  Bait and switch is you advertise one thing, and then try to pass off something inferior. Please elaborate on what brother offered her, and what inferior offering he tried to pass off on her.  \n\nManipulative is crying to mommy and daddy when you don't get your way and then throwing a tantrum about not liking their food to try and get them to force your brother to share.  \n\nIf I give my coworker part of my lunch every day for a week, am I now obligated to do that for eternity, because they've come to expect it?  No.", "Yeah I don't think it's the worst thing in the world. That's why I said that OP was NTA. It just bugs me because at some point that person might be in a relationship with someone who won't be too pleased at the idea that he doesn't have to do anything in the home because he goes out to work. Long term it's probably a bad lesson even if in the immediate term it works out.", "I don't think I even hinted at saying that. I said my perspective was informed by my background and circumstances, where it would be extremely privileged to be able to afford to pay someone because you couldn't be bothered to do housework.\n\nTeaching an older child they can fob their chores off on other siblings is a bad lesson in my view, because it teaches them at as soon as you leave the house to do work, work in the home is something to be avoided.", "First I don\u2019t think he should be forced to share. He initially brought home the food for everyone and enjoyed sharing it as a family. It became a ritual and part of their relationship with no expectations of anything in return. Then he asked her to do chores and she very coldly said no. The next day the ritual of food sharing now requires her to say yes and do chores. He changed the terms of the gesture and without a warning. Also he waited until she was excited about it at the table so she can sit there and watch everyone else eat. This is manipulative. There\u2019s other ways to express anger and hurt feelings.\n\nEdit: I pointed out she\u2019s an AH too. Back to your coworker example. If you said \u201chey I can\u2019t bring you food anymore bc <some reason>\u201d or \u201cThis was supposed to be temporary and it\u2019s turned into a thing and I can\u2019t do this everyday\u201d that is different than \u201cI asked you to do my report for me and you said no so now you can\u2019t have food but I will bring it for the rest of the team.\u201d", "The lesson isn't don't do chores. The lesson is do your chores or pay someone else to do them.  My husband pays someone to come in and do the heavy cleaning anymore. I don't care.  If I had to do it I would care but I don't.", "But he'll either end up in a relationship with someone else who works, in which case obviously the argument \"I work so I don't have to do housework\" doesn't hold water, or in a relationship with someone who doesn't work, in which case that person probably would be the one responsible for 90% of the housework.  So either way it would resolve itself.", "1. Where does it say brother enjoyed  feeding the entire family?  Rereading it - it never actually says he was initially sharing by his own choice.\n2. She didn't sit there and watch everyone else eat restaurant food.  He shared with his brother.  OP and his wife ate food they made (the food daughter said was gross and refused to eat - in an attempt to manipulate them).\n3. She sat there and watched everyone else eat because she refused to eat.  She tried to manipulate mom and dad into forcing him to share.  She tried to manipulate older brother into feeling bad for her and caving.  There are other ways she could have expressed anger and hurt feelings.\n4. What should son have done?  Refused to bring food home?  That's still \"manipulative\" because he's punishing sister by your standards.  Share with her and then just cross his fingers that she helps him next time?  good luck with that.  Tell her - \"if you don't help me, I'm not going to share\" - is mom really going to stand for that?  And isn't that just as \"manipulative\" with how you define it?\n\nDaughter learned a hard lesson.  You are entitled to other peoples things.  If you're nice to people, they're nice to you.  If you're an asshole, they treat like you an asshole.  OP's manipulative like how my boss is manipulative - I don't get paid unless I do work for him. \n\n   \n It's clear we're not going to change minds, for you - it's manipulative for son to treat people with the same respect they treat him.  That's fine.  I'm not going to go back and forth when you keep repeating the same points.", "Again, I said esh and daughter was ah as well. I have agreed on that multiple times now. You keep missing that part and writing paragraphs about her. As well as I said he isn\u2019t required to share. Also not treating this as a requirement to feeding her, it seems like a treat to me. I used your work example to point out how it was manipulative so you could see the parallel. \n\nI assumed he enjoyed sharing because he did it over and over and sounds like he voluntarily shared. The post would probably have mentioned an ongoing argument about sharing the food otherwise. Usually you have the option of eating at the restaurant after shift, which I figured he would do if he felt like he couldn\u2019t say no. Yes I did assume some basic things, it\u2019s Reddit and I\u2019m not really going to research their entire life relationship.\n\nThey seemed to get a long well enough from the post so I don\u2019t see a reason why he couldn\u2019t have talked to her about the incident and maybe they would have come up with a solution. At worst he could have let her know before hand instead of springing it on a hangry person and imploding the dinner for everyone involved. Doing petty stuff to each other as punishment is just going to escalate things and they will end up hating each other. \n\nYes his reaction is teenager-ish and not surprising at all but it\u2019s still an ah reaction.", "I'm not missing that or ignoring that.  I'm just responding with how ridiculous I find it to call son an asshole."]}
