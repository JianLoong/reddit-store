{"id": 1168, "submission_id": "ym0n3w", "title": "AITA for blocking all contact with my father?", "selftext": "To sum up an emotionally traumatic week (and 6 months of pure hell), I have decided to block my father from my life. As much as I didn\u2019t want to, I feel that to preserve my emotional and mental state, it was necessary. He\u2019s verbally and emotionally abusive towards me and my sister has histrionic personality disorder. On one particular occasion, I found out a few months prior from my half sister (12 yr old) that this other sister (let\u2019s go by A, who\u2019s now 21) hurt a cat at the family owned animal rescue with its medication. She said the cat was acting feral and being a bitch, so she decided to end it\u2019s life in front of my 12 year old sister. My little sister was horrified and informed my father, yet he did nothing to A but get rid of paperwork to avoid possible animal control/animal cruelty charges. By getting rid of paperwork, I mean removing documentation of that animal\u2019s existence at the rescue. (I didn\u2019t know of this until months after it happened since I live in another town.) I\u2019m disgusted that instead of addressing my sister, he downplayed the situation. Sister A bragged about it months later stating that she enjoyed it. I\u2019m horrified and disgusted by her actions. Since then, sister A has caused nothing but family drama, fabricating lies about me and my fianc\u00e9 (we\u2019re 27/28) and my father is so sick of me from hearing the lies from her. At this time, I brought up many occasions where she has lied to everyone in our family, stolen from me, wrecked my car, injured an animal before his eyes, and how he does nothing and says nothing to her. This event and her lies have destroyed our relationship and he tells me I need to be institutionalized and I\u2019m a mentally unstabled bitch because I can\u2019t get over it. I\u2019m a very truthful and honest person and it destroys me having to live with their deception and lies. My father and I got into an explosive argument and with him cussing me out and talking down to me, I threatened that if he ever contacted me again, I would let authorities know. What should I do? I want a peace of mind but I don\u2019t believe I will be able to have a relationship with my father or that sister again due to all that has transpired since April.  How can I move on from a once healthy relationship with my father/sisters to accepting that I know they are toxic to my mental and emotional health?
