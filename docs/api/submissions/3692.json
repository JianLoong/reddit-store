I have a daughter who is in toddlerhood and I want to open Santa presents with her at our house. Last year my daughter and I lived at my parents house so obviously it was no big deal and we did our normal thing. Since we have our own home now, I\u2019d like to open presents with her at my house and asked if we could all gather at 2pm at my parents, do presents, then have dinner at about 5. This way we\u2019re still spending the same amount of time together. It\u2019s important to note that this is what we did growing up, my brother (26 M) and I would spend the morning at our house and then we would all go to grandmas for dinner. \n\nWhen I brought this up, roommate turned to my brother and said \u201cThat doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll be at my parents house Christmas Eve to Christmas morning\u201d.

I don\u2019t really think so, because this is the way it was when I was growing up, and I think is the way most families do it. I mean, it would be weird to tell my daughter Santa comes to her grandmas house.\n\n\nETA: I don\u2019t believe my brothers roommate is his boyfriend.

This might be an opening for asking your brother a bit more directly about the situation and give him the space or opportunity to tell you what's up. \n\nA great approach could be to say to your brother:\n\n*Hey, I didn't mean to maybe sound a bit rude toward roommate the other day.

The roommate should be spending Christmas with his own family like he just said he was, not trying to tell you what your family can do on Christmas based on his needs.", "NTA - You might have been a bit rude in how you expressed it, but not AH for the basic premise.  This is not a family member, it's a roommate who has had the benefit of joining family meals in the past.  You have a child now, traditions evolve as families change and what you have asked for is totally reasonable.  A roommate's feelings don't really belong in this equation.", "I don't understand why the roommate said anything, this is your family planning, not his. If he is your brothers partner that should have been a side discussion with him. Not the whole family.

I got that impression", "ESH both comments are a bit arrogant, christmas is a time where it's hard to fit everyone in, especially if people are bringing guests. \"That doesn't work\" is a bit much and suggests everyone should reschedule around him. \"It doesn't matter\" is also a bit much and suggests you don't have to think of others at all. \n\nI feel like everyone's being overzealous saying he's def his boyfriend like not everyone has the same approach to friend inclusion in families just bc it would be weird in one family doesn't mean it's weird in others. I know lots of people who invite mates for christmas but it would never occur to me to do so. \n\nI also don't honestly think it matters, if your brother introduces him as his friend/roommate then that's how you should approach it. There's something I find pretty weird about the idea that you should just assume he's lying and they are dating.", "Correct answer is \"Oh, that's too bad!  Maybe it'll work for your schedule next year\".\n\nNTA", "NTA and why is this roommate so familiar?", "Re: Your edit - just because you're out means nothing regarding your brother or his room mate.

Also, since you aren't hosting, you don't get to dictate the terms of the holiday just because you have a kid.  EVERYONE gets a say in the plans.  Relax, have a coke and a smile and discuss what options there are like adults.  AND MAKE YOURSELF AVAILABLE FOR COMPROMISE!  Just because you want that for YOUR child (and you have every right to) does not mean everyone is obligated to conform to your requests.", "I'm gonna say YTA.\n\nIf the brother's roommate is that involved with your regular family get togethers like that.. he's not just some random roommate. he's part of the family now, and what he does, thinks, and feels within the realm of your family absolutely *does* matter.

That's super rude.\n\nHowever.. all that said, I don't understand how that would conflict with the plans you were putting forth. If you want to spend the morning at your house with your daughter, and he wants to spend the morning at his parents' house, and then you all meet at your parents' house for dinner.... like, what is the issue there.

It's always a moment when somebody needs to change an established holiday routine. You don't need to cling to the fact that you did it this way when you were kids? You're doing it this way now because you want to do Christmas at home with your daughter while she's young. Understandable. \n\nYou don't need to be rude to anyone to assert this right.

He's allowed to talk to his roommate about plans they have made together without you dismissing him as if he's irrelevant.", "YTA bc while he\u2019s not family he was invited by the person hosting the dinner so his response was not out of line. Your mom is right you aren\u2019t the host and it wasn\u2019t your place to say something. He may be a just brothers roommate to you but it seems your family considers him family. So yeah you\u2019re a rude AH because his opinion obviously matters to everyone else so your snide b****y comment about how it doesn\u2019t matter is obviously not true. Why can\u2019t your child open Santa presents after dinner when you get back home? Is she even going to remember this because she\u2019s what only 2?

She has a child now, and if she wants to do presents at home first, that's normal. She didn't demand everyone change their plans and I didn't see where anyone objected to it besides the friend. The edit makes him seem more entitled because he wasn't even invited at that point.\n\nI may feel different about this than others because my son had a roommate, and we invited him to weekly dinners at our house. When we went out to dinner for a holiday, we DIDN'T invite the roommate, but he showed up anyway, ordered a lot more food than anyone else (apps, main course, cocktails, AND dessert), and said nothing when the check came. My husband and I decided we didn't want him over at the weekly dinners anymore because that was rude and entitled AF.", "I don\u2019t see the conflict either. If anything, wouldn\u2019t going to your parents the morning of Christmas be worse? Because he will be at his parents? \n\nI read it over and over again and I\u2019m pretty sure one event is Christmas Eve and one is Christmas?", "Then ask for clarification. This isn't about you not understanding an issue that's raised. It's about your casual, thoughtless rudeness.", ">I don\u2019t see the conflict! If he\u2019s spending Christmas Eve and morning at his parents he can still be at my parents on Christmas at dinner.\n\nHe wasn't invited. Why are you acting like this was an option? Did you ask if they had their own plans in the afternoon? It's the obvious and logical explanation for a conflict.", "Telling someone that\u2019s regularly involved with the family that they don\u2019t matter is why YTA. You could have either tabled the discussion and talked to your brother when his roommate wasn\u2019t around or found out why it doesn\u2019t work for the roommate and discussed it in a way that wasn\u2019t hurtful. \nEven if he\u2019s not your bother\u2019s BF, he may be going through things you\u2019re not aware of. The holidays are hard for a lot of people. \nThere are lots of ways you could have handled this without being rude to him.", "Did you consider he had plans _after_ he left his parents with your brother which he would not be able to do if your brother was eating later in the day\u2026", "[deleted]", "Do you dismiss your best friend in the same way", "Agreed, it just seems to me that OP took over planning the event around her child even though she wasn't hosting it.", "So the plans went from ones he definitely couldn't attend, to ones that he could attend (even though he wasn't invited) and you think that was somehow a conflict he objected to? It doesn't make any sense because it's clearly not the issue.\n\nHe said to the brother that him changing his plans wouldn't work because he was with his parents on Christmas Eve and Christmas morning. Even if he didn't have specific plans with the brother in the afternoon, it sounds entirely like the conflict was him not seeing the brother on Christmas day.", "I agree that they were having their own conversation. And I think OP was the AH for butting in and basically telling the roommate that he wasn't important.", "No, you\u2019re confusing family dinners with Christmas. I agree, brother isn\u2019t likely doing Christmas with his roommate\u2019s family, but OP says nothing about family dinners.", "The brother and his roommate probably had plans for the afternoon of Christmas day. They were both supposed to be with their families in the morning. They both had the afternoon free. The roommate was not previously invited to OP's family Christmas celebration.\n\nIt seems like the very obvious reason why he would turn to OP's brother and mention it.", "He\u2019s the one who said \u201cthat doesn\u2019t work,I\u2019ll be at my parents\u2026..\u201d so obviously I would assume that was the conflict, not plans with my brother. My brother had no problem switching the plans.", "Yes, and he can. As I said in the post, there is no scheduling conflict. He can spend Christmas Eve and morning at his parents and come to my parents for Christmas dinner.", "But in her own words she didn't take over planning, she just asked if they could do things differently. If she had demanded a change and said that they wouldn't come if it didn't hapoen like she wanted I would say Y T A.", "They live together they would have seen each other at some point.", "I dunno I think she just didn\u2019t realize that it was an issue. \n\nShe didn\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t important. She said that it didn\u2019t matter when his Christmas was in comparison to theirs because they\u2019re at different times. She didn\u2019t realize roommate was part of the Christmas equation. Not that HE doesn\u2019t matter, but she thought the times of both Christmas parties didn\u2019t matter.", "He said that to your brother, when your brother is in a conversation discussing altering his Christmas plans. It's not like he said it to you. \n\nWhat you were suggesting wouldn't be relevant to him at all if he had no plans with your brother. Either he planned to spend the day with your family without being asked (unlikely, and also made possible by the plan change, so super unlikely to be the conflict), or he and your brother had said they'd spend some of Christmas together (which would explain his wording, and his conflict).\n\nYour brother not minding about switching the plans does not mean that he hadn't made plans with his roommate.\n\nEdit to add: your plan change still would have caused a conflict for him, which is why he would use those words.", "Yes! Okay, this is what I\u2019m reading? You need to maybe apologize if your tone came off as rude but it came from a place of genuinely being confused. Like.. there\u2019s no conflict?? Ask him to clarify and why he cannot attend both if that is what he would like.", "But the logic that he was inviting himself is still backwards. How could the problem be that? The change in plans would allow him to come. That's the opposite of a conflict. \n\nIf I had made plans to see my family for Christmas morning, then spend the rest of the day with my roommate, I would also be sad if they were suddenly not going to be available. That's a logical conflict.", ">She didn\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t important. She said that it didn\u2019t matter when his Christmas was in comparison to theirs because they\u2019re at different times.\n\n\u201c\u2026.It doesn\u2019t really matter, does it???\u201d While not directly saying he wasn't important, this statement does give off \"be quiet, this is nothing to do with you\" vibes. It seems clear from the response to her statement that it wasn't taken in a positive way. The 3 question marks, and the fact that her mom invited the guy to Christmas dinner and said she was being rude, suggest that she did say it in a rude way. \n\nIf she'd said \"so you'll be free in the afternoon, you can come to dinner with us, what's the conflict?\" then she'd have been fine. The way she shut that down and assumed he had no relevant plans with the person he actually said it to, that's what makes her an AH here.", "He hadn't been invited to their Christmas at the time. I think it's very obvious that the conflict was with plans the brother and his roommate already had for Christmas afternoon.", "Did you find all my comments and purposefully comment the same thing on them? It was not obvious to me. I\u2019m not going to try and deduce what people are talking about and I\u2019m not a mind reader. People need to communicate", "No, I didn't realise you had made the same comment in multiple places. I just think the conflict seems obvious, so when I saw comments where people ask what it could even be, I responded. \n\nOP didn't give them space to communicate, she shut him down."]}
