I have a daughter who is in toddlerhood and I want to open Santa presents with her at our house. Last year my daughter and I lived at my parents house so obviously it was no big deal and we did our normal thing. Since we have our own home now, I\u2019d like to open presents with her at my house and asked if we could all gather at 2pm at my parents, do presents, then have dinner at about 5. This way we\u2019re still spending the same amount of time together. It\u2019s important to note that this is what we did growing up, my brother (26 M) and I would spend the morning at our house and then we would all go to grandmas for dinner. \n\nWhen I brought this up, roommate turned to my brother and said \u201cThat doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll be at my parents house Christmas Eve to Christmas morning\u201d.

I don\u2019t really think so, because this is the way it was when I was growing up, and I think is the way most families do it. I mean, it would be weird to tell my daughter Santa comes to her grandmas house.\n\n\nETA: I don\u2019t believe my brothers roommate is his boyfriend.

This is not a family member, it's a roommate who has had the benefit of joining family meals in the past.  You have a child now, traditions evolve as families change and what you have asked for is totally reasonable.  A roommate's feelings don't really belong in this equation.", "I don't understand why the roommate said anything, this is your family planning, not his.

I know lots of people who invite mates for christmas but it would never occur to me to do so. \n\nI also don't honestly think it matters, if your brother introduces him as his friend/roommate then that's how you should approach it.

That's super rude.\n\nHowever.. all that said, I don't understand how that would conflict with the plans you were putting forth.

So yeah you\u2019re a rude AH because his opinion obviously matters to everyone else so your snide b****y comment about how it doesn\u2019t matter is obviously not true. Why can\u2019t your child open Santa presents after dinner when you get back home? Is she even going to remember this because she\u2019s what only 2?

Now I know that COULD be because they've only been roommates since summer and the only holiday that would have been celebrated in that time frame would have been Thanksgiving (assuming your American). Your brother shutting him down is definitely relevant to the story and adds a new perspective that wasn't clear before. \n\nHonestly, I lean toward NAH, but I do think you should talk to your brother about his plans. His facial expression could still have been one of discomfort/embarrassment. I know you have said, more than once, that you don't believe your brother and his roommate are anything more than that, but this sounds a LOT like some of my friends who have partners who can only be out to one of their families.

By the same token, if he\u2019s not going to come out but also expect the same courtesies be extended to his roommates as a member of family rather than a tack on, then he needs to say.\n\nBut more I can easily 100% see family actually including close family friends schedules into planning the holidays.

Because that's very indicative of someone in a relationship.\n\nEdited to add: Just because *YOU* are comfortable being out as bisexual doesn't mean that your brother is not gay. Nor does it mean that just because you came out that he'd just automatically be comfortable with it! *He's* not *you*! Everyone reacts to things differently.
