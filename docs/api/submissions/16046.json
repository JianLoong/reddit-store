I just didn\u2019t think anyone would care to remark on it.\n\n2. I have been bullied VERY hard before. It was in high school but even as a grown woman it stays with me.

He wouldn\u2019t have been calling out your \u2018fake innocence\u2019 and inviting you up to his private room if he wasn\u2019t after a hookup. It wasn\u2019t a joke, it was an invitation. Don\u2019t listen to anyone saying \u2018you could have been nicer, or try letting him down without being so rude\u2019. They\u2019re wrong.

I\u2019m kind of upset that my friend is calling it awkward flirting because to me, that wasn\u2019t flirting. It felt so embarrassing with him insinuating I\u2019m wild and acting innocent and saying he\u2019s \u201chearing stuff about me\u201d. None of that makes me want to get in bed with him. Why would he think that would work? Or was he just trying to insult me in general just because? Idk", "Yeah. OP was way too polite. Def NTA.", "No mercy", "Honestly, I do feel bad that I did shake his hand and even graced him with a smile. It was a reflex. I saw him the next day and he acted like I didn\u2019t exist lol but I\u2019d rather he do that than talk to me again", ">No-one should be excusing this kind of behaviour\n\nI didn't read it as an excuse but more about explaining his intentions. You can try to flirt in really bad, gross or embarrassing ways", "that's such predatory behaviour, and the fact that he's acting like you did the bad thing when he was trying to prey on someone he thought he could manipulate is so gross.", "I also learned about negging from this thread\u2026 barf. What a tool, I\u2019m glad you were so confident to tell him to get lost! Probably threw his peanut brain for a loop. NTA by a million.", "He also threw out a challenge  at the end with the \"from someone who wouldn't fuck you\"\n\nHe was fully expecting that would hurt your self esteem to be rejected and that you would then  work to get him to fuck you to  recover your self esteem  by getting him to fuck you", "For me, it just takes so long for what\u2019s happening to actually catch up. I\u2019m not very good with being in the moment because I\u2019m over analyzing everything. I do wish I had done more though", "On vacation?
