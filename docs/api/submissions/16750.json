Everyone started clapping, me included, until I saw a kid of around 12 dive in the water next to them. For context, this area of the pool is only six feet deep, and No Diving signs are plastered all over the pool deck near there. I stopped clapping, blew my whistle, and yelled \u201cNo diving!\u201d at the kid. She had already said yes by then and they were kissing. Right after I yelled, the mother stopped videoing and approached me. She said I was an \u201casshole\u201d for \u201cruining a beautiful moment.\u201d She said that the video will forever have me in the background blowing the whistle and yelling.

If they wanted somewhere quiet to propose, they should have chose somewhere quiet. A pool opened to the general public is not the place. Thanks for doing your job and keeping everyone safe!", "Ehhhhh, I say NTA. The man proposing should have spoken to the manager prior. Also, who the heck proposes at a public pool? Lmao (I mean maybe it\u2019s where they met but cmon now. They can\u2019t expect a perfect video out in a public. ..What if someone started drowning at the same time??)", "Nta.  If you propose at a pool (or any public space really) you can\u2019t expect that life just stops for everyone else and they prioritize your proposal.  You were working, your job is to enforce the safety rules of the pool.  It\u2019s pretty damn important that you keep doing that despite what else is going on around you.  \nAnd the video isn\u2019t ruined, they can have someone mute you out.", "NTA. That\u2019s the risk you take when you propose in a public area. I\u2019m glad you were paying attention to the water. And hey, if the couple has a sense of humor they\u2019ll be laughing over this for many years.", "Nta. That's a dangerous situation, and your job is to try and prevent injuries.  You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA! The mom is though. You were doing your job. Period. She was out of line. \n\nIf they wanted a quite environment for the proposal then a pool with kids was a stupid choice!", "NTA. It's a local pool open to the public or at least to members. This means there are going to be other people present including kids doing whistle-worthy things. If the couple wanted total control they could have booked a private facility. Or they could have done it at a less crowded time. You had a job to do. You did it. Your management backed you up.\n\nFrankly I think the expectation that everyone is going to stop what they're doing to ooh, ahh, and applaud over someone deciding to commit matrimony is a bit much.", "NTA. The rules you were enforcing are there for the safety of those kids - that is much more important than a video of a proposal. Also, this is the danger people need to accept when they have events like this in a public venue. \n\nYour job was to protect peoples\u2019 lives, not some woman\u2019s video. Trust your manager on this, not some entitled old woman.", "This is amazing; they're getting engaged at a *pool* for some reason, and in the video is an authentic pool activity to cap it off.\n\nPresumably the pool is meaningful, so having an authentic lifeguard scolding should make it more special.\n\nNta", "NTA \nPool safety is way more important than some proposal video.", "NTA.  You are responsible for the safety of people in and around the pool. That doesn\u2019t stop just because someone wants to propose.  If they wanted an uninterrupted proposal video, they shouldn\u2019t have done the proposal at a pool.", "NTA. Unless your job description says \u201cenforce rules so people don\u2019t die, w/ exception of a public pool proposal happening simultaneously as said drowning, then lifesaving activities are null and void until the celebrating family has the pictures they desire\u201d then YTA.", "NTA! The had a public engagement at a public pool. You were just doing your job.", "NTA. I have to say, I did think you were gonna say something like they got pissed you had to run through the video to help a drowning kid. That would line right up with how entitled and obnoxious people are getting.", "NTA. They are not the main character", "NTA.\n\nPropose in public? \nYou risk the public \u201cruining\u201d the moment.\n\nLife is not a damn play.", "NTA.

Was the ring a miniature floaty?", "NTA. That is your job and even if you had blown the whistle while he was proposing, safety trumps a proposal. Besides, they should have known out in public, esp at a pool, isn\u2019t a romantic, quiet place", "NTA - you were doing your job", "NTA. \n\nWho the hell proposes in a public pool and thinks they\u2019ll get Center stage ??? \n\nPublic proposals and people\u2019s entitlement are so weird to me. \n\n\n(Maybe a little YTA for the kid tho ?
