{"id": 21352, "submission_id": "14qnh3z", "title": "AITA for reccomending a PG film that my friend found inappropriate for her child?", "selftext": "We have recently watched the new Netflix film Nimona, and my five year old daughter absolutely loved it. To be fair; we all did. The animation style was captivating, the writing was genuinely clever, and I laughed out loud several times. \n\n\nToday, as I collected my daughter from school, she was excitedly telling her best friend all about the film. I told my friend (we will call her Emma) what the name of it was, went on a mini rant about its many virtues, and then waved them both goodbye.\n\nI've just had a text from Emma asking me why I reccomended such an inappropriate film and asking me if I am sure I want my daughter watching things like that.\n\nTo add some context to those who have not seen the film yet; there is a romantic relationship between the characters Ballister  and Ambrosius, who are both male. There is nothing on screen except for hugs, hand touches, and one brief kiss at the end of the film, which lasts barely three seconds.\n\nAbsolutely nothing that my daughter hasn't seen a dozen times on screen between heterosexual couples before.\n\nMy daughter's main takeaway from the film was that Nimona was awesome and that she wanted to turn into a dragon and a dancing shark. She doesn't care who kisses who and neither do I.\n\nI seriously didn't think that I was friends with anyone who would see anything in this film as a problem but now I am second guessing myself and wondering if I have ruined a friendship and whether she will tell her daughter not to play with mine anymore.\n\nWas I the arsehole here?\n\nEdit: \n\n\nTo everyone asking why I haven't updated yet. It is 7am in the UK, so I'm just getting everyone up for school, and Emma hasn't responded yet. \n\nI apologised that she didn't like the film but I have also asked her what she found inappropriate in it. I have yet to get a reply to this.\n\nThe violence: \n\nSeveral people have asked whether my friends' objections could stem from other elements of the film. It does contain a brief and bloodless dismemberment and several scenes that would fall under the bracket of 'mild peril'. Nimona does attempt suicide. However, this is done in a very fantastical manner and is also why I watched this film with my daughter. If she had been distressed in any way, then we would have stopped watching).\n\nI have been friends with Emma for three years now and we have watched so many disney films with our girls over the years. We took our girls to see Encanto and the new Little Mermaid in the cinema. There is nothing in this film more graphic than we have seen in Mulan, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Lion King, or Tarzan. All of these are films we have watched without Emma raising objections.\n\nSeveral commenters have suggested that Nimona may be suitable for some five year olds but not all. This is completely fair. I have an imaginative little girl who loves acting out her favourite scenes, but I can see some children finding it a little scary. \n\nI will be seeing Emma for the school run at either 8:50 or at the end of the day at 3:10.\n\nOkay. EDIT 2.\n\nEmma has just left. We met on the school walk, and all was normal, so I asked her back to mine for a cup of tea and a chat (we do this quite regularly).\n\nWe talk a bit about the upcoming school disco and the inset day, and then I mentioned that I'm sorry she didn't like the movie. \n\nEmma straight up said that she should have at least watched the trailer first and that she knows I let Lottie (my kid) watch a lot more PG films because we are a family that likes watching films together and that Lottie has her tablet time for things like Teen Titans Go and Glitter Force that we are happy for her to watch independently. \n\nShe also said that I let Lottie [placeholder name] watch a lot of things like the first three Harry Potter films (my husband and I decided that four would be too scary and we only watch the first three as a family) that she would never let her girl watch even all together.\n\nI asked if it was about some of the themes like suicide and she looked completely blankly at me. I had to remind her that Nimona sacrificed herself at the end of the film, and she just waved that off and told me that that wasn't the issue.\n\nShe was concerned I am impressing trans ideology on my kid at the age she is.\n\nTo be fair. It was my turn to look blank.\n\nShe asked me if Lottie had any questions about a girl that was sometimes a boy and was only happy if she was constantly turning into something else.\n\nI think I just said that Lottie found all of the transformations funny and likes the cereal dragon and shark the best.\n\nEmma just finished her tea and said that it's fine if I want Lottie to be asking questions about men kissing and girls turning into boys but I shouldn't be surprised if she grows up not knowing who is supposed to be.\n\nWe parted mostly amicably, I think, and we are still on for plans at the weekend but she did say that I should really be watching things that are suitable for my kids' age even if they aren't as fun or interesting as films aimed at older kids and that they should enjoy being little girls while they can.", "created_utc": 1688496458, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qnh3z/aita_for_reccomending_a_pg_film_that_my_friend/", "score": 4474, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All kids are different but I've never met a 5 year old I would show this to. \n\nIt's weird to me that OP was apparently raving about the movie when they recommended it, but didn't mention anything about these aspects.

Listen, I LOVE Nimona, it's one of my favorite comics and I'm so glad it's getting some love. But like, do you have experience with kids? \ud83d\ude2c\n\nI wouldn't have shown this to my little brother at age 5. He was sensitive to violence and sad scenes, he had nightmares from much less violent shows. tbh I wouldn't have shown it to him at 12, he had terrible impulse control and would literally quote the movie while breaking stuff.\n\nI wouldn't show this movie to my 5 year old niece, who would probably love it, because she is headstrong like Nimona and would also emulate the movie. She's extremely clever but like all 5 year olds, might struggle to comprehend moral grays. I can't wait to show it to her in a couple years. \n\nI spent several years in childcare and I don't think I've met a single 5 year old I would show this movie to. The fact is when they hear something funny, like butt face or doodoohead, they will repeat it a lot and cause problems. I think it's funny but most parents do not. Then others are sensitive to violence and dark topics. Even the most mature 5 year old likely can't reason with morally gray stories and characters. Did you know nightmares are often caused by things kids can't understand, rather than just scary imagery? \n\nAnyway the point I'm getting at is all kids are different. PG generally means to do your own research, but if a friend who had known me and my child for years recommended a film, I would probably trust it. If I then told my friend that I didn't find that recommendation appropriate, and they jump straight to \"it must be the gay hand holding!!\" despite me not showing a single sign of homophobia before, I would feel like I had been set up.

You could even just leave it at as serafina suggested  that you *didn't notice anything inappropriate when you watched it...but it is rated pg so you're sorry and won't make a recommendation of a PG movie again until she (Emma) says it is appropriate.*   \n\n\nPushing for an answer to \"so just what about it was inappropriate to you so I don't make this mistake again?\" - might not fix things. If you apologize for recommending a PG movie you didn't find inappropriate for your child, Emma might either accept your apology or offer up that 'it's not that it was PG it was the violence (or the gay characters)' or whatever it was she found inappropriate.  \n\n\nUnless you're looking for a \"gotcha!\" moment or want to terminate the friendship, I'd not press her on what was inappropriate and just apologize for recommending a PG movie for a 5-year-old.

ND Stevenson is a trans man and has gone through a whole gender journey since the graphic novel was initially released, and recently said that when he was writing the graphic novel there are definitely themes that should have alerted him to the fact that he is not cis. this is something my partner and I picked up on, but it would likely be too subtle for most kids to connect the dots... it's still a lesson about not letting fear make us drive away people who are different, >!not believing everything the government/institute tells us especially when it's about vilifying others to maintain control!< , etc", "I watched half of *Nimona* last night - I wouldn't let really young kids watch it because of the amount of violence involved.

Did you miss the rest of the paragraph you pulled this from the middle of?  \n\n>Parents need to know that Nimona, which is based on the best-selling graphic novel by ND Stevenson, includes messages of inclusivity and acceptance but also has pretty constant violence that could frighten sensitive viewers despite its being punctuated by humor. This includes deaths (or presumed deaths), loss of limbs, stabbings, explosions, fearsome monsters, threats, bullying, and teasing. The shape-shifting teen character of Nimona (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz) expresses glee at being a \"villain\" and wreaking havoc, even in committing \"murder,\" but viewers discover that her behavior stems from being shunned and misunderstood because she's different. Mild language includes \"butt,\" \"dork,\" \"stupid,\" \"trash,\" \"freak,\" and \"dang.\" Two characters who are battling for the soul of their civilization -- and falling in love with each other -- are played by actors of British Pakistani (Riz Ahmed) and South Korean (Eugene Lee Yang) heritage. Characters learn and demonstrate empathy in this tale about treating others as you would want to be treated, no matter what differences divide you.

Violence doesn't have to be bloody, but beating people up, playing with knives, blowing things up, and straight up saying you're going to murder someone all constitutes violence that some parents/kids may not be ok with. Likewise rude language doesn't have to be cussing, but anything you don't want kids to repeat, potty language. Nimona as a character is also headstrong and naughty in a way most wouldn't want their kids to emulate. The plot revolves around heavy and dark themes that I would argue most 5 year olds are not ready for, and many parents may just want a chill movie night without having to explain political or philosophical topics like why good people do bad things.

If anything, it'll help kids who actually are LGBTQ+ understand themselves more, because they have a role model, someone they see themselves in, and that can be very powerful. And if they're not, then they're going to grow up to be amazing allies, and we need as many of those as possible right now! \n\nGrowing up can definitely be confusing, but kids are smart and know themselves, and we need to give them more credit for that.\n\nI'm glad your kid enjoyed the film, I did too!
