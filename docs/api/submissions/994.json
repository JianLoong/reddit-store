Its a shitty business tbh. Anyhoo, the store owner (we'll call her Penny) has an 11 year old granddaughter we shall call Maya. Our store is understaffed, A LOT. Like we have to close down lobby and one of our drive thru lanes some (most) days. I worked there from January to July of this year, tried out other jobs for a few months and now I'm back. Since I've started working there again, Penny has had Maya working on the floor, making blended drinks and icecreams on 2 separate occasions. She doesnt wear non slip shoes, we have fryers and other things that can be dangerous to a child, and its overall a toxic environment for anymore especially a child. I talked to a few co-workers and apparently this was a regular occurrence. Out of curiosity I asked her how old she was, and if she left school early to come and work, which was a yes. \n\nNow this breaks 2 Child Labor laws that I know off the top of my head, 1. Employing someone under the age of 14, and 2. Having her work during school hours. So naturally I snapped a photo of her working and called up the department of labor. The guy I talked to said this was actually quite a serious matter and that they'd be opening an investigation on my store.\n A coworker of mine we shall call Alice, figured out it was me. A lot of people know bc I was the loudest person about how fucking weird it was to be working with a child. Alice says that it was messed up of me to call the Department of Labor because it messes with the store owners' liability because Penny is facing possible child abuse charges,  and that i should have just talked to Penny personally instead. I do feel pretty guilty because of the possible charges and honestly I didn't think they would take the investigation this seriously. But I also believe that it isn't my job to tell the store owner what the laws are.\n\ntldr: I called the department of labor on my boss for having her 11 year old granddaughter work on the floor and now I feel bad about it", "created_utc": 1667445056, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykqphh/aita_for_reporting_my_store_owner_to_the/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everyone who allowed this going on for months is an accomplice , no matter how hard the situation is at home you don\u2019t ask your kids to provide for you and specially in a place where there is specific hiring rules . Penny should\u2019ve known better than to bring her daughter so she can save a few bucks.", " NTA at all! You did the right thing. Most people don\u2019t like making waves so I\u2019m not surprised you got negative push back but this was absolutely necessary", "NTA. The law is the law. I'd expect some backlash from this, but I hope you hold your head high. You did the right thing.", "NTA. Child labour laws exist for good reasons.", "NTA you have the best interest of the child at heart. But, I think there are exceptions to child labor laws when working at a family business. Definitely not exceptions to safety standards, though.", "NTA. You did something you thought was in the best interest of a child for their safety. There is nothing wrong with that. DoL will investigate and make the final call. Keep in mind that parents and legal guardians can have their children working in their family business under the age of 14. Not sure about grandchildren or exactly how unsafe the environment is. So it is possible they will drop it but if it really is as dangerous as you say, probably not. \n\nGood call, OP.", "If in the US if she has custody of the kid or the parents have partial ownership then it may not be illegal. Most child labor laws don't apply if your parent owns the business. I've worked the same jobs and owners kids frequently work at young ages.", "NTA The best way to not get in trouble for mistreating you child is not mistreating your child. You did the right thing for this girl.", "NTA. The owner knows what she's doing. Any normal person knows it's wrong to employ an 11 year old and have her work during school hours. Even without being familiar with child labor laws, every functioning adult understands this is wrong.", "NTA but definitely start looking for a new job OP, I'd worry about retaliation.", "NTA", "NTA Yes, this is horrifying and you absolutely did the right thing calling the department of labor. But you should also be contacting CPS. Sure, the department of labor will probably involve CPS at some point, but I think it's better you report it immediately. She's taking her 11-year-old grandchild out of school to work for her?! That alone is reason to get CPS involved. Who knows what else is happening in that household if her grandmother is using the kid for free labor while she's supposed to be in school. And where are her parents in all of this?!\n\nAlice is also a major asshole for defending her and trying to enable your boss. I know a lot of people like that, they don't think people should get involved in anyone's business, no matter what crimes that person is committing or how horribly they're treating their kid. Don't be like Alice.", "NTA. In retrospect, I'm sure you realize it would have been better to be less vocal, as to not implicate yourself as the whistleblower. You may be fired in retribution. If you are, it would be illegal in most places, if you wanted to you could fight it, but honestly these kind of jobs are pretty easy to come by.\n\nYou definitely did the right thing. The child's safety was in jeopardy. You are not the cause of the owners troubles. Her poor choices did that.", "NTA \n\n Better now than if her granddaughter gets hurt on the job.", "Not to make it seem ok but some places have exemptions to child labor laws if it is a family owned business. The fact that it is a franchise may mean that it cannot be classified as a family owned business. That being said if this is a job that generally requires a certain type of footwear and age limitations on what they can do why is the child not wearing f the proper footwear if it is legal for her to be there? Where are the parents in all this or does the grandmother have custody? Nta someone needs to make sure the child is safe.", "I've been looking for other jobs for ages, and I mentioned how I took about 3 months working at other jobs. I don't own a car so a business that is 20 minutes away from my home by car, takes me 2 hours to get there by the bus. This job is in the perfect spot that I could simply walk if I needed to. I'm an 18 year old highschool and college drop out and I don't have a lot of options", "So I was actually terrified of facing retaliation for this so I brought it up to the caseworker that I called and he told me that if they even tried to backlash, it would be highly against the law and I could sue them", "I explained everything to the case worker and he said that this was 100% illegal.", "Not this young and definitely not during school time", "Because of my state laws, a child cannot work during school hours and if they are under 12 then they can only work in non official businesses (baby sitting, dog walking, etc) or in family owned agricultural businesses.", "see i thought everyone just knew it was wrong, but a lot of people didn't seem to care or care enough to take any action", "I explained this in another comment that if they chose to retaliate it would give me grounds to sue. and, not to fart in my own hand and sniff it or anything, but I am one of their most reliable, fast, and hardworking wage slaves, so it would be fairly easy to prove that they retaliated due to me reporting them", "I agree that I should have been less vocal about it but I was so fucking shocked! I couldn't believe that she was in there. I honestly thought that if I brought up how messed up it was that somebody would have the balls to do something about it.", "I honestly have no idea about her home situation. Penny is a very sweet yet dumb old lady and it's hard to tell if she is playing dumb sometimes or if she is actually that dumb", "OT, at 18 you are still VERY young. Please don't think you don't have a lot of options; at your age you still do. Be kind to yourself, and remind yourself that this is just a phase , while you decide what to do. A lot of successful people have gotten GEDs, then went on to training in the trades, health care,  college, etc. You're clearly a kind person based on what you did for Maya, so be kind to yourself too.", "Like the comment before me mentioned , try to get your ged . Now a days you dont need a degree to get a good job all it takes its a few classes and a certificate or license to practice. You\u2019re doing good things, look for online jobs , they are also a good option and you would have to just work from home. One of my cousins works for the state and all she has is a high-school diploma and some customer service background. Some jobs dont require that you can always start as beginner.", "Obviously they would know better than I. Good for you for taking action.", "I do have my GED, but man I do not have any passions or interests in anything really. and while you say it was kind of me for what I did for Maya, I could definitely tell she was so excited to be working there and earning her own (out of pocket) money. Thank u for this comment tho it gave me a lot of hope <3", "You don't have to have a special passion-- honestly, most people don't. Just choose a path-- for example, a short community college course in operating some kind of medical equipment--  then you can modify it as you go along and figure out what you like."]}
