But don't let him guilt-trip you into stopping, tell him you want the new him to see the new you in due time. That's all I can think of besides that it's fine for you to feel that way but don't let it metastasize into hate because hate is cancer that takes up space in your soul, mind, psyche whatever you want to call it.

Truthfully, I do understand that you've tried again and again to help him and watch others help him, but, as someone who is half way to my weight loss goal, its really hard to reframe your relationship with food. Its not like a drug you can avoid, you need it to live. I do hope you decide to give him some more time, but I don't think you need to completely pause your life.

The net result is that OP has exactly zero faith or trust in her father, not even any experience really of relating to him as a father, through no fault of her own. \n\nAt this point the onus is entirely on him to rebuild that relationship - he doesn't get to make demands on a daughter he blatantly kept in second place to his addictions, even after she lost her mother and was completely reliant on him. In fact it's pretty damn arrogant that he's trying to dictate anything to her.

Obviously that's a different scenario as your dad's inability to do these things was caused by his addiction. But I do think it is important to ask whether you were so focused on the things he couldn't do that you missed what he did try to do. Of course, this may not be the case, and he might not have been there for you emotionally either. \n\nEither way, you have your own life and you need to live it. Part of the whole confessing sins/addiction thing should be understanding that you can't erase the hurt you've done and people aren't obligated to forgive you.

I only mention the above because it's something I've had to do with my own dad who has pretty much zero emotional availability, but tries his hardest in other ways.
