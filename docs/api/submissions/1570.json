Come up with one thing you're ok with- maybe one movie a week- and tell him that's what you want for a touch point. How he reacts is a REAL good test of his fitness as a parent- if he can't put your needs first after a lifetime of neglect, he had bigger issues than food.  Go to San Diego. Have a great life. Tell him you'll do one phone call a month and if those calls don't feel good, go to a call on his birthday. And then to no calls- whatever it takes to get right for you. Don't feel like you need to come home to visit if it's not happening for you. You survived a really really bare childhood and deserve to create the best adulthood you can.", "NTA. Live your life. Have the courage to make your own choices and live with their consequences - just like your dad needs to.", "NTA.  Your life is on the brink of what is next.

Keep going with your plans and when you look back at growing up, know that your parents were human and that your dad used food to cope with clearly something. Maybe tell your dad that you will know him as a nonaddict down the road and that it isn't goodbye forever and that you both have plans that need to be attended to. But don't let him guilt-trip you into stopping, tell him you want the new him to see the new you in due time. That's all I can think of besides that it's fine for you to feel that way but don't let it metastasize into hate because hate is cancer that takes up space in your soul, mind, psyche whatever you want to call it. Don't bear a grudge just a board.", "NTA\n\nThose are you feelings, and honestly the only way he can change your view of him, is to continue to create more positive memories that negative and that is going to take time.", "NTA. You\u2019ve got to do what\u2019s right and healthy for you. That being said, maybe try to throw him a small visit before you leave. If you can\u2019t don\u2019t feel bad. But addicts need help to get better and they need motivation. And it is 100% NOT up to you to make that happen, it\u2019s definitely up to him. But if you can spare a little time, that could help him soooo much, more than you know. You are young and you have your own priorities though. And if being around him is toxic and hard for you, then maybe try to wait it out and try again another time when you\u2019re back in town to visit. I only say all this as a daughter of an alcoholic dad. I didn\u2019t let my dads addiction take precedence over my life, but I made myself find time to be with him when I could (even if really, really hated it sometimes). And he\u2019s no longer alive so I\u2019m glad for the times we had together. So going to visit your dad, even if it\u2019s only for an hour, might be something that\u2019s good for him but also therapeutic for you in the long run.

They're not yours and you don't need to be emotionally responsible or intertwined with them.

It\u2019s hard for parents to realize they can\u2019t have a \u201cdo over\u201d with their kids childhood years. He will have to work on that in a 12 step program.

Less than a year sober I was just hitting 18 and he was trying to telling me what I should do with my life (school, where to live, etc).\n\nI told him flat out \"You missed the chance to be a father, now trying being a friend\".  It was a rather brutal thing to say, and it hurt him, but it was how I felt and where the relationship had to go first before anything else.\n\nExplain to your father you are your own man due to his actions.  Trying being a friend for now and see where it goes.", "I don't think you're necessarily an asshole, but this is an instance where you're not being supportive. I would try to make an effort where your father is concerned. Truthfully, I do understand that you've tried again and again to help him and watch others help him, but, as someone who is half way to my weight loss goal, its really hard to reframe your relationship with food. Its not like a drug you can avoid, you need it to live. I do hope you decide to give him some more time, but I don't think you need to completely pause your life. Make it a full month or a month and a half, a small delay isn't a pause or putting your life on hold. \n\nI have a complicated relationship with my parents, but its better now that I'm an adult. Give this new dynamic a good, solid try before you basically write him out of your life because the dynamic is going to be different and your relationship will be different. It'll be a hard switch, too, but don't just give up until or unless its a detriment to you to continue any relationship with him at all.", "Yta.

The net result is that OP has exactly zero faith or trust in her father, not even any experience really of relating to him as a father, through no fault of her own. \n\nAt this point the onus is entirely on him to rebuild that relationship - he doesn't get to make demands on a daughter he blatantly kept in second place to his addictions, even after she lost her mother and was completely reliant on him. In fact it's pretty damn arrogant that he's trying to dictate anything to her. OP is NTA and while I agree that giving her father a chance would be kind, it *must* be on her terms.", "I don\u2019t think OP is complaining because his dad is fat\u2026his dad is trying to emotionally manipulate him into staying\u2026if dad is that overweight, I\u2019m guessing OP has been more of a caretaker to his dad than his dad has been to him.

The father is the adult; addictions are just so muddy and this is a pivotal point where their dynamic will change because OP is an adult now, too, so, I just hope OP makes a solid attempt given this pivot. \n\nIt might be arrogant of him to be upset about the timeline, the jest I got was that he was more disappointed, but I may have just read it differently. \n\nWe do both agree it should on her terms, I'm suggesting I see the possibility of a little compromise here that may not be detrimental to them moving on still. \n\nI suppose it is unfair to call them unsupportive, its just what I got from reading; they'd given up and I don't blame them. I guess this could be because they've been trained their life to think of their dad a certain way.

I think 300lbs was an under estimate", "Info:\n\n Did your dad ever try to bond with you in other ways? Everything you've listed is basically him not being able to physically do stuff. But there's a lot more to a relationship than just those things. I mean, my elderly grandmother couldn't do any of those things either, but that doesn't mean we couldn't bond. Obviously that's a different scenario as your dad's inability to do these things was caused by his addiction. But I do think it is important to ask whether you were so focused on the things he couldn't do that you missed what he did try to do. Of course, this may not be the case, and he might not have been there for you emotionally either. \n\nEither way, you have your own life and you need to live it. Part of the whole confessing sins/addiction thing should be understanding that you can't erase the hurt you've done and people aren't obligated to forgive you. Just because he's better now doesn't invalidate the past or your feelings. I only mention the above because it's something I've had to do with my own dad who has pretty much zero emotional availability, but tries his hardest in other ways. I still have resentment towards him for what he wasn't, but acknowledging what he did try to do has made our relationship easier.", "YTA\n\nDoesn't sound like he is asking OP to stay.
