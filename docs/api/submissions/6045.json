He shouldn't have to abandon them to stay married to you. After this, do you think these friends will be very supportive of his decision to reconcile with you? How do you think it will affect your marriage if he has to cut contact with people he cares about to be with you?", "NTA Op! You should include the context of your comments in the original post. That's why you were mislabeled.", "YTA - Ofcourse your husbands friends will support him.\n\nYour husband is an AH too for kicking his friends off a trip planned before you got back together. \n\nHis essentially telling his friends he doesn\u2019t care that they had his back.", "NTA. You're a couple and you can't really have friends who OPENLY dislike part of the couple. Your husband decided his relationship with you is more important than with these others you uninvited. His decision to make. The uninvited are not owed a stay at his family's place.", "YTA they planned this trip which means they clearly paid for it you did not so why should you get a free trip on there dime and yes it is a free trip for you since you did not pay for anything.", "NTA imo.", "Friends are being T.A. Ya\u2019ll need supportive friends in your relationship. You said you\u2019d stay home. So called friends need to reap what the sowed and it seems continue to sow.", "YTA. Sounds like he has loyal friends. Now you get to go on to a trip that you originally weren\u2019t invited to and dictate who comes?", "This is why friends should stay out of you business", "NTA. They were horrible to op based on her comment to someone else.", "Read comments", "I would love to hear the other side of this story", "I don't see how OP uninvited them herself. She didnt make the final call, the husband did. All she did was say she wouldnt go if her bullies went which is... valid?", "\"he agreed I could uninvite them\"\n\nFor this I understand that she was the one addressing this, but I could be wrong.", "They were separated for three years.", "According to OP they were super abusive. I\u2019d like to hear the other side of this story.\n\nMy money is that this relationship is torched", "It sounds more to me like this was his trip, his say. So when she said she wouldnt go, he agreed but had her relay the news. That doesn't make it any less his choice as it sounds like OP just wouldn't have gone otherwise", ">now bake him away, toys \n\n\ud83d\udc80", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA. It was literally not even your trip. Fair to say that your husband shares the blame though. This will only causes more strife.", "Yta. Yta. Yta. Hopefully he'll see sense and divorce you.", "The fact that they ( friends) are now saying mean things to her now that they can\u2019t go proves that they are the a*#holes.", "YTA yes you seem to be the asshole, sounds like you have been one for a while.", "Your comment about what they did is really important to consider, because what they did is so beyond acceptable behavior. So beyond it, it worries me you\u2019d want to be with someone who is friends with people like that", "YTA", "NTA. I'm guessing many of those voting otherwise haven't read the OP's comments or are hung-up on the maybe false idea the OP's husband is filthy rich because of the cabin in Switzerland. (Depending on what country OP is in and how rustic the cabin is, may not mean much financially.)", "YTA and addicted to the drama apparently.  Oh no...you found out you lost some friends in the impending divorce.  What kind of psycho shit is it to not reconcile with them as well.  Those friends are better off without both you and husbands dramatics.", "After reading your comments NTA. You should edit your post to include that. This really just seems like karma to me, sucks to suck for them. If they hadn't been AHs the wouldn't be having this issue right now.", "I\u2019m going to gently go with YTA here. This could\u2019ve been handled in so many different ways. You and your husband could\u2019ve easily sat down with everyone and discussed how you felt. Instead you caused unnecessary drama by uninviting people and likely will now have issues with everyone else. You let your ego get in the way of what could\u2019ve been a fun trip", "Judging from your comments, I wouldn\u2019t want to be friends with people who treated my significant other that way; separated or not. There was a point where you cared for them and to have gone friends actively try to get the cast out from things because she \u201cisn\u2019t one of them.\u201d is disgusting. NTA. You gave them the same treatment they gave you and they don\u2019t like it. Treat others how you want to be treated.", "Yta. So is your husband. Its ironic that you are judging them abt being a good friend when neither of you can even comprehend what that means. This was meant to be a guys trip. Not yours. So what if you reconciled. Shouldn't mean his trip is off. It would be one thing if you sucked it up & went along but to actually punish HIS MALE FRIENDS for choosing to stay his friend during the split is crazy. How many of your gfs reached out to him during that time? And if any did, did it make you uncomfortable? If they didnt, did you ban them too for not being his friend? Its not middle school. His friends are his friends. Theyve been nice to you & friendly but unless you were friends 1st & did things without your husband, thats an odd expectation", "nta", "Going with NTA. Your husband should\u2019ve never tolerated his friends treating you like that and now that you\u2019re back together they should be supportive and since they have not been they should be blacklisted. Anybody telling you otherwise it\u2019s probably a man oops i mean boy.", "Nta I don\u2019t get the friends giving grief to the spouse of a divorcing couple, unless it involves abuse.  Some people just find they don\u2019t mesh well together and are better off not being Married.  People makes mistakes, sometimes it all comes down to how each of the couple communicates with each other.  There\u2019s no need to take it personally when your friend divorces.  You got back together with your estranged spouse and now those friends of his who went out their way to be unpleasant to you, are experiencing the consequences of that action.   You clearly communicated well to your dh over your feelings regarding it, and he chose you over his friends.  He communicated back to you he was unhappy about it but preferred your attendance at the holiday over his friends.  You both communicated well over a sore point in getting back together.", "She is an -AH.\n\nBut kudos to her! Why should she be friends or play nice with people who treated her badly?\n\nShe is a justified AH.", "Can you edit ur comment to ESH instead of YTA if you think both OP and her husband are at fault?", "I don't see why OP should care given what they did to her.", "Nope. They\u2019ve learned that the guy they thought was a friend can be manipulated too easily by his wife.", "His friends are the TA here by purposely making her life miserable while volunteering just because 2 of the friends happened to be volunteering at the same place. Then telling her in the face that they knew he only stayed out of obligation. Hard to feel pity for people that tears people down for no reason.", "Why is it that you people can't just accept that we're most likely never going to get the other side of the story and your assumptions have no base. Just shut up and accept that they were abusive. No one has said op is some perfect being, just that they aren't the asshole in this situation. Good God I'm tired of everyone trying to one up each other on their crazy, baseless theories.", "It was not an ultimatum, but rather a reasonable boundary. Not wanted to take a trip with people who harassed you until you quit a volunteer hobby is completely reasonable.", "Yes, probably I wasn't clear. That was what I was trying to say. Both agreed, she told them.", "Well, he's not poor, but he's not necessarily rich just because he's got a cabin in Switzerland. I mean, doesn't it depend on where OP and her husband live? If they're in western Austria, northern Italy, southern Germany, or eastern France, the cabin wouldn't be very far. I've known middle-class people who have rustic cabins less than 100 miles from where they live.", "Why don\u2019t you just shut up. Go rant somewhere else. Actually, you can rant all you want because it\u2019s an online forum so I\u2019m not going to stop you. \n\nYTA", "Well its both, it being a boundary doesnt make it not an ultimatum. Im not saying shes wrong im just saying its not simply the guys choice, hes been given 2 options and he chose OP", "Someone's throwing a hissy fit over being called out.", "An ultimatum is a demand, \"You do this or else....\" Stating, \"I'm not going based on X situation\" is not making a demand."]}
