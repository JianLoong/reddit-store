He has zero loyalty and seems to be \"valuing his wife's comfort over others\" by abandoning people that took his side originally.   \n\n\nThat's.... not a good look. And OP knows and is weaponizing his behavior against those she sees as enemies when for all we know they were supporting a friend through a tough time. AKA she's being vindictive and catty, and that's an AH move, and not one I can see the justification for.", "We also don't have any information on what they did past \"treating her as less than\" which... isn't much. And we still don't know what triggered the separation, or who's friend they were prior to all of this.  \n\n\nFor all we know they were the husband's friends that she became friends with, then the separation was due to her cheating. Yes that's worst case, but we don't know. I can't call someone an AH based on leaps that large.", "They\u2019re missing on a vacation\u2026 that THEY planned. OP was added on after the fact, but suddenly she gets to dictate everyone who goes? No, she should just stay home if she doesn\u2019t want to be around them.", "I understand that.  I asked a hypothetical, because it seems the votes on this sub are inconsistent, depending on who does the uninviting", "Well, it's a pity OP didn't elaborate more. But when I broke up with my ex when we were teenagers. He turned everyone against me just because he could. It was a really shitty time. People either turned on me because of what he said or didn't want to be involved so they did nothing when he would continue to spread lies in front of them to other new people we met. No idea what OPs story is, but it sucks when the other person turns everyone against you for no real reasons.\nOne of my \"friends\" said I was in the wrong for breaking up with him. Because if I wanted to avoid the drama I should have just never broken up in the first place.", "If you\u2019re friends with a couple, and they separate, unless one did something messed up, you don\u2019t treat one like crap while staying friends with the other. And even if they did something bad, wait til the divorce because of couples getting back together\u2026. \n\nIt really depends on how they actually treated OP and if OP did something like cheat to cause the separation. If OP did nothing and they just became hostile for no reason other than picking sides, they\u2019re AHs.", "Except they weren\u2019t officially over. It\u2019s really and if he situation.", "Except the husband would rather have her there than his friends, it's his family's place, and he made the call to disinvite them.", "They should've been decent to OP, then they wouldn't have been disinvited. They chose to treat OP badly, and OP's husband has decided his marriage is more important than his friends and their shitty behaviour towards the person he loves. Husband could've said \"sorry babe, it's all been planned, you're gonna have to sit this one out.\" He didn't. So it's unfair to put it all on OP when husband had an equal hand in the decision.", "You could also look at it as they treaded his former ex like crap. Them being back together doesn\u2019t really change how they treated her\n\nMe questions is is how bad is \u201creally bad\u201d. Like ignoring, or actively insulting and being bully\u2019s to her. Ignoring her is not really bad", "Except they weren\u2019t officially over. It\u2019s really and if he situation. And I wouldn\u2019t want them to go either. But that\u2019s just my opinion", "I mean....**they were still married the whole time**", "I'm betting they just chose him and not her. The devil is in the details and I'm guessing those details wouldn't reflect well on the OP.\n\nUsually when friends \"treat someone badly\" after a breakup/divorce/separation, it's due to infidelity. Not saying that's the case, though.", "It was in a comment the OP made.", "I realized after I responded to you originally that the reason for the separation wasn't given, and that's pretty critical information for figuring out some of the dispositions. This could very well be an E S H or something else. So I'll grant you have a point there with the friends as we don't know what they know/what they were told, or even who's friend they were first. We need more information there. What we do know is the husband is an AH, and I still stand that she's an AH for weaponizing that now that she can unless a whole lot of information is dumped.  \n\n\nAnd, none of us judge in a vacuum. I've... had some experience with both being the friend or being the OP/husband on this. 3 years is a rather long separation and I'd say it's not unreasonable to think they're not going to get back together. And choosing sides was... pretty standard in any break longer than 6 months. Did it get awkward the few times people did get back together? Oh for sure. But we were all grown ups and worked through the prior commitments and various parties. These two just sound catty and like people I'd just steer clear of if I was anyone else in that group trip.", "3 years is different than a couple of months.  OP is YTA", "When people are separated for three years most people assume they\u2019re over.", "Cause she pressured him into it. Did you even read the post or just skim over it? She literally said she wanted to go and told him she'd only go if he dis-invited them. That's an ultimatum.", "he sucks mayorly too. And should reemburse them all their cost, such as plane tickets. Them not liking his ex was not new info for him, he planned that trip and let them make the cost knowing that. \n\nSticking them with the cost is as bad as thieft, and i would threat it as such. i wonder if small claims court can do something about broken promises in this case.", "They were separated for three years.", "Yeah that's my guess too.... treating someone badly vs choosing to be better friends with the other partner are very different things.", "She said in the post they treated her badly and like she was \"less than \" . Seems cruel to me.", "OP says they were treated badly by the friends. Hence, 'treated like crap'. And the timeframe doesn't matter, they were separated, not divorced, so they weren't exes, they were estranged. \n\nI can understand the husband's friends siding with him, you're right, that's entirely normal. Treating OP badly, however, was something unnecessary that they chose to do. They don't then get to complain about not being allowed to share space with someone they've made clear they despise."]}
