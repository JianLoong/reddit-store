Not saying that's the case, though.", "It was in a comment the OP made.", "I realized after I responded to you originally that the reason for the separation wasn't given, and that's pretty critical information for figuring out some of the dispositions. This could very well be an E S H or something else. So I'll grant you have a point there with the friends as we don't know what they know/what they were told, or even who's friend they were first. We need more information there. What we do know is the husband is an AH, and I still stand that she's an AH for weaponizing that now that she can unless a whole lot of information is dumped.  \n\n\nAnd, none of us judge in a vacuum. I've... had some experience with both being the friend or being the OP/husband on this. 3 years is a rather long separation and I'd say it's not unreasonable to think they're not going to get back together. And choosing sides was... pretty standard in any break longer than 6 months. Did it get awkward the few times people did get back together? Oh for sure. But we were all grown ups and worked through the prior commitments and various parties.

And the timeframe doesn't matter, they were separated, not divorced, so they weren't exes, they were estranged. \n\nI can understand the husband's friends siding with him, you're right, that's entirely normal.

It is a very difficult situation.  Husband doesn't want to give up his friends, but when you are married, your spouse takes priority over your friends.  Best compromise is that husband sees the friends only when you are not with him.

If he is serious about being with you, he needs to talk to them and explain that he is serious about making things work with you and that means taking responsibility for his actions which hurt you. So if he said unkind things about you to them, he was wrong and he has to apologize to you and them. But now that he is aware of their true feelings about you, he also has to reconsider whether they can be as close to him because their continued presence in your lives will compromise your relationship. If they can find a way to take responsibility for how they treated you and earn back your trust, maybe down the road you can be in a place where you feel comfortable vacationing with them.", "NTA. I saw in the comments where OP describes more specifics about what these \u201cfriends\u201d did and it is a doozy of nasty pettiness. I would not want to go on any vacation involving them, either. It sucks to have your vacation plans cancelled after making preparations and preparing expenses, but they really dug their own hole by bullying OP before the divorce was finalized.\n\nGiven all they did, I would strongly advise both OP and the husband to do everything they can as a couple to cut those \u201cfriends\u201d out of their lives entirely. Now that their true colors have been exposed, and they have drummed up so much hostility toward OP, I could see them being a continuous point of contention for this marriage, and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they tried to secretly undermine it.

You can\u2019t expect people to treat it the same as a separation.

You assumed they felt a certain way about you and got your revenge. When a couple separates it puts mutual friends in a very awkward position and they often don't know how to act.
