They made plans while you were separated, and now you're asking him to choose between them and you?  This trip could have helped mend things and you're being divisive about it.\n\nTry to reverse the situation.  Imagine you made plans with a friend during the separation.  Your friend, supporting you during your pseudo divorce say some unkind things about your husband. You invite your husband along, and he demands you kick your friend off the trip.", "INFO - how did his friends treat you badly? Were they actively doing mean things to you or did they just not reach out to you or invite you places anymore?", "INFO: has anybody paid anything for this trip? Did you say to your husband \"I'm not going if they're going\" or \"I don't want to go because they treated me badly and I don't feel comfortable spending that much time with them\"? Have you discussed the way they treated you with your husband before this? If so what was discussed? \n\nThere's really not enough info here to be able to judge.", "Going with YTA (though your husband is a big one too)\n\nThis trip wasn't  planned by you, and he just added you? And then booted a bunch of others just because you found out a few chose him in the separation (which sucks but happens)? That's a truly crappy thing to do. The friends supporting you two sound like AHs as well unless said uninvited people were straight up abusive. That changes things, but other than that y'all are just being catty, unpleasant people.   \n\n\nIf I were one of the uninvolved friend I'd nope out of this drama because this is all so dumb.", "We can\u2019t really make a fair assessment because we don\u2019t know whether you or them are the toxic parties here, given you haven\u2019t told us what you mean by them treating you badly and or what you did to them as well.", "ESH\n\nReneging on invitations is impolite. That's particularly true when they may have already purchased tickets, arranged for time away from jobs, etc.\n\nThe reality is that in most cases of separation/divorce, \"mutual\" friends of the couple are, in fact, likely to be more friendly with one particular partner. That does not make the friends AHs themselves, although they should be more mature than to \"call you names.\"", "Why are you handling the uninviting and not him? He's throwing you under the bus to try to maintain his friendships with people who treated you poorly. If he's serious about reconciling, he needs to be on your team 100%.", "yta\n\nThey spend time and money on this trip. They most likely can not get all their money back. you where seperated for 3 years. they liked your husband and not you, so they only stayed in touch with you. since you are demanding he cut of his friends and cost them hunderds of dollars in tickets, i can completely understand anyone not liking you. trip was planned while you where his ex, so offcourse you can't do this.\n\nIf i was your husbands friend, i would take the loss and not go, then never speak to that spineless person ever again, invited or uninvited at this point. At the very least it would no longer be a friends trip since 4 people where uninvited, so the nature of the trip has changed.", "YTA - This wasn\u2019t your trip. This was his trip with his friends, and he asked if you wanted to come. That doesn\u2019t mean you get to take over planning and make him uninvite those friends.\n\nI don\u2019t know what these people did to you exactly, so you likely have your reasons for not wanting to hang out with them. If they treated you badly, then it\u2019s no wonder that you don\u2019t want to be around them anymore. But this sounds like a conversation you need to have with your husband, about how these people treated you and how you feel. Let him come to his own conclusion of if he wants to uninvite them or still hang out with them, and from his choice, you make your own.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to stay with someone who knowingly chooses to be friends with people who were actively nasty to me. It seems like you two have more things to work through, or your differences may be irreconcilable. Instead of highjacking his trip and making yourself come across as controlling, talk things over and examine your own feelings, then decide what *you* will do.", "YTA. Your husband\u2019s friends did what friends do when there\u2019s a breakup. Are you trying to manipulate him into no longer having friends?", "YTA, but honest showing that they were right about you.", "YTA. Plans have already been made. You should have either sucked it up and gone and reconciled the friendships, or just chosen not to go. Now that the issue has been brought up, the former is not possible. You have decided to insert a wedge in the friendship between you and these friends that likely will not recover", "YTA- I see your side of it but they planned the trip with you not involved, I just wouldn\u2019t go instead of changing their plans", "*before we started reconciling, my husband and his friends planned a trip to Switzerland*\n\nYes, YTA", " YTA & so is your husband. The friends were invited first & per your comments, they have already spent money on their tickets. Very likely they\u2019ve arranged time off work & done other things to get ready to travel. It\u2019s very rude of your husband to disinvite them because of a late comer to the trip. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty common when couples separate, that they keep their respective friends. They probably thought they were being loyal to your husband, & it appears you were separated (3years) long enough to think your marriage was over.", "You said you\u2019ve been together since teen years? Were these friends you mutually acquired? I\u2019m inclined to go with a soft YTA. Unfortunately when couples separate the friends get stuck with picking a side. You mentioned you were treated badly by them and whilst I don\u2019t excuse this behavior was it possibly as a result of your husband expressing some of his frustrations which led to your separation? As others said your husband is definitely an AH because this trip was planned during your separation, if you wanted to go I think it would have been up to you to suck it up as such. But I do acknowledge it probably would not be a very fun trip for you", "YTA - They planned this trip a as group, you're the add-on. Also, if you and your husband are really trying to make your marriage work, alienating his friends probably isn't going to help matters. If you have something to say to them, say it to their faces but honestly, I think you should just have adopted a grin-and-bear-it attitude on this occasion.", "YTA", "I think the fact that they already bought plane tickets means this is a bit of shit move on your part. Yes they were AH for being nasty to you but you weren't around when they planned. You should probably be the one bowing out here.", "ESH. He planned a trip with his friends, why is he suddenly inviting you along without consulting his friends first? \n\nAnd then you\u2019re TA as well for accepting to tag along and then uninviting people. You could have just declined to go on this trip and planned a different one with your BF. \n\nAlso, these things happen with separation: people take sides. It sucks, but it was probably already clear to you that these people bonded with your BF over you before.", "Info: why were you separated?", "ESH you shouldn\u2019t go, especially if his friends have invested time and money into this trip. Your husband should\u2019ve said no and you should\u2019ve respected that decision if he did. Your husband poisoned the well, they\u2019re reacting off what they\u2019ve been told.", "ESH, why can\u2019t you communicate. Literally just sit down and talk about your grievances. You both sound like children JFC.\n\nETA: Can\u2019t really uninvited people who\u2019ve already paid for a trip and made accommodations.", "NTA. What comes around goes around. Hold your ground. Unless they apologize to you and you forgive them, they\u2019re not worth folding over for. They should be adult enough to understand that.", "NTA\n\nThey're clearly not supportive of your relationship and would most likely try to stir things up on the trip. That wouldn't be a fun trip for anyone aside from them.", "NTA. They are toxic", "NTA. Sounds from this like they might have been assholes before as well as continuing to be assholes now. But I dont know everything that went down.", "NTA, sorry but I\u2019d have uninvited them too if I found out they\u2019d been treating my S.O. badly. From the sound of it the separation was something you both agreed on because you wanted to figure things out before it crossed into hate instead of caring for each other. Yes friends can pick sides during things like that but real friends don\u2019t turn onto douchebags and degrade/insult someone you loved just because you aren\u2019t together.", "NTA, actions have consequences and now they can face the consequences of their actions. They treated you terribly when they thought you were getting divorced which they shouldn't have so obviously you wouldn't be comfortable around them. Your husband wants you there more then he wants them there.", "Nta\n\nSounds like you were right for cutting them out.", "Esh a bit but it really depends on what the slights when you were separated entailed. I can\u2019t blame you for not wanting to be around them even if they didn\u2019t do anything malicious, but they aren\u2019t wrong for being annoyed if their disinvite means dealing with flights/time off work already booked. \n\nNow if they sat around urging your husband to cheat or threw him a separation party when they heard the news I have to wonder why you\u2019re not more irritated with your husband for maintaining the friendships in the first place.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
