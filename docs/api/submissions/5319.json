At the wedding I had everyone coming up to me telling me congratulations on the baby which I had only told my immediate family. I walked up to my bio father before the wedding started and asked him why he was telling people I was pregnant when I asked him not to. He got mad at me saying I should be glad he\u2019s excited and wants his friends to know and I was disrespectful at his wedding and ruined it by embarrassing him. I ended up just leaving without saying goodbye. Later I found out he was telling the rest of my family how bitchy I am and how I was so disrespectful. After everything that\u2019s happened I have no longer let him know anything about my child, not even the gender or name. It has been 6 months since his wedding and he still thinks I\u2019m in the wrong. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: \n\nWe did have a date picked out for the announcement and it was just a few weeks after his wedding. We were waiting for our first ultrasound and until we were in the second trimester incase we had a miscarriage during the first trimester. \n\nI do understand that I shouldn\u2019t have confronted him at his wedding.

You now know everything you need to know about your bio-father by his reaction.  Going NC with him would seem reasonable based on how he responded to you and how he's badmouthing you to anyone that will listen.", "YTA for punishing your child and your father. He should not have announced your pregnancy, agreed. But to severely delink relationships is downright ridiculous.", "Your prediction of the divorce is based on the wrong info.  Without knowing a single thing about OP, the fact her parents divorced, her dad got remarried and divorced again, and then got remarried only one year after, has given op a disadvantage in having healthy relationships.  This along with the fact she got pregnant at 22 leads me to believe you are right though. \n\nI know and am prepared to get a lot of downvotes for this, but most 22 year olds are not yet fully emotionally mature, and having a child that young with someone you aren\u2019t even married to is a good indication to future relationship issues."]}
