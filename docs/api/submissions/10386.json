She does a lot of orders for wedding cakes that require custard or marmalade fillings, and I offered to help her out by making these fillings at home and bringing them to her so she has less work to do.\n\nUnfortunately, the past four times I\u2019ve made these fillings, my girlfriend (F24) has literally dipped her fingers into the filling jars and contaminated them because, in her words, she \u201cjust wanted to try some.\u201d I\u2019ve tried explaining to her that she can\u2019t dip her fingers in and contaminate the entire batch, because then I have to remake it. I said she should use a spoon and take some out if she wants to try so bad, but she just pouts and says that she likes using her fingers because it takes her back to her childhood.\n\nToday, I was trying to finish some chocolate custard to send it over to my sister really fast because she was running late on a wedding cake order for an important client. I told my girlfriend beforehand to not eat the custard, and if she really wanted to, to please use a spoon. \n\nI get out of the shower, and what do I see? She has her fingers in it again! I totally lost it because this is the fifth time she blatantly disregarded what I said, and I yelled at her and told her to \u201cstop fucking eating\u201d the food I\u2019m making, because it\u2019s not for her and she\u2019s contaminating it. \n\nShe started crying and got mad at me for \u201cfat-shaming\u201d her, even though I made no comment on her weight and she has no history of weight issues or eating disorders. I know I was harsh, but she kept pushing my limits.

It had nothing to do with her weight and everything to do with her not respecting a boundary you\u2019ve been trying to set that makes PERFECT SENSE. You shouldn\u2019t have to keep wasting your time and money because she keeps contaminating food to sell to other people. You even gave the spoon as a compromise (though she\u2019d probably double and triple dip the spoon). Yelling wasn\u2019t nice, but I understand you\u2019ve been pushed to the breaking point.

I know everyone's like break up! Over every little thing in here but ...I would break up over this.  She is showing a lot about her character by doing this over and over.

Doesn't believe in food safety.  \n\nI'd NEVER be able to eat something she cooked.  Ever.

There's something totally weird happening here and I am sure it crosses over into other aspects of all her relationships.", "NTA. She is being so beyond weird making it a thing to use her fingers. Even needing to use a spoon is ridiculous I mean how does she lack such self control? Can she not make more just for her or go buy another treat? It\u2019s for a purpose, to help a business it should not be this hard to not eat some. I think you\u2019ve been nice to say she can have it with a spoon for her to disregard it to be gross is so weird. Imo it also shows that she doesn\u2019t care about your sisters business and that is awful and selfish. \n\nIf you were saying it for her eating in general it would be a different thing obviously, but this isn\u2019t the case & she is projecting her insecurities.", "NTA She is disgusting, disrespectful, and immature.", "NTA. \nBringing back childhood memories isn't an excuse for this nasty behaviour she shows.

You are preparing food to be served to the public, and she is putting her fingers in it, because she wants to pretend she is a child again? Actually, both pathetic and disgusting.

Seriously, I'm sure she has a bunch of wonderful qualities that you adore about her...

You're helping your sister and your gf has zero respect for her or you obviously. You gave her the option of using a spoon and she still used her finger. It was your right to get angry, and nothing you said was fat shaming. Your gf could cause your sister quite a lot of loss of business. Seems likes she's just playing games and blaming you for getting mad at her for things she did wrong. Personally, I would get rid of her. If she can't respect being asked to simply keep her fingers out of the food,  what else will she not respect??", "NTA - you are trying to support your sisters business and already provided sensible boundaries to your gf. She can have a taste but use a spoon to not contaminate it. That is fair enough.\n\nTo ignore that rule more than once is rude. She knows well enough that you have to remake everything which costs time and money.

She has a clear boundary issues, not to mention that she has disgusting habits of sticking her dirty hands into other people\u2019s food and using her childhood as an excuse to her bad behavior. Except she\u2019s a grown woman, not a child. If someone accidentally gets sick from eating the cake, your sister has to take the blame.

I said she should use a spoon and take some out if she wants to try so bad, but she just pouts and says that she likes using her fingers because it takes her back to her childhood.\n\nToday, I was trying to finish some chocolate custard to send it over to my sister really fast because she was running late on a wedding cake order for an important client. I told my girlfriend beforehand to not eat the custard, and if she really wanted to, to please use a spoon. \n\nI get out of the shower, and what do I see? She has her fingers in it again!

Is she somehow threatened by you having a relationship?", "Yes, this sounds like some peeing on territory shit.\n\nOP, you need to get better at redirecting the conversation when someone is trying to manipulate you. You obviously did not fat shame her, but she is trying to guilt you for being upset over wasting your time and materials. \n\nShe knows this is wrong, but instead of confronting that it bothers her (you spending time and resources on your sister) or she struggles with impulse control, it\u2019s easier to make you feel bad\u2026.on top of prioritizing her above your sister\u2019s deadline and your time and resources as well. My guess is she will do this again, showing that she is not mature enough to be in a relationship. \n\nAt worst case, there\u2019s some sort of jealousy and she\u2019s intentionally sabotaging you instead of having a grown up conversation. At best, she cannot control herself or understand why you cannot lick other people\u2019s dish\u2019s\u2026.and refuses to accept that\u2026.also gross because that will jeopardize any family holiday meal you attempt to cook. \n\nThis is just weird behavior, and I cannot seeing someone being so fantastic that it\u2019s worth keeping them around despite this. Whether it\u2019s impulse or intentional, she chooses to do something that hurts and disrespects your time, resources, and energy.", "The custard sets in such a way that if you try to drag your fingers or a spoon over it no matter how carefully you do it, it will be obvious. \n\nBesides, every time I didn\u2019t have to remake it, it\u2019s because I went to send the custard right after making it so my girlfriend didn\u2019t have a chance to sneak in at take some.", "Exactly my concern", "Exactly! I had to redo the custard so quickly, and then my sister was so stressed and rushing to put the cake together.

Insist on it. But a bowl with her name on it. Treat her like the spoilt petulant child she insists on being.\n\nThe \u201cfat shaming\u201d comment is pure deflection. But it\u2019s also worthwhile having a conversation with her about why she wants to sabotage your sister\u2019s business and your efforts to help. Is she jealous? Is she resenting the time you spend on it with just an offer of a slice of cake as compensation? Does she feel she\u2019s paying for it (cost of ingredients) and so she\u2019s entitled? \n\nThat\u2019s really the only way to solve for this.", "Since you have gone over this with her multiple times it\u2019s safe to say at this point that it\u2019s intentional.

Dump her.", "Or she just thinks it's \"quirky\" and \"funny\" and enjoys OP getting worked up over her childish behavior.\n\nSome people just like ticking other people off.\n\nOP should either go the full mile and revoke certain privileges (I dunno, no netflix? No takeouts unless she is paying?) since she insists on playing a child, or have a heart to heart along the following lines -\n\n\"I'm not your father. I'm not your mother. You are an adult, and while I understand that you want to relive your childhood, what you are doing is actively attempting to harm my sister's business and your conduct could make someone very sick, or at worst, dead. Do you want your actions to be the cause of someone's pain? Do you understand that you playing at being chidlish could cost so many different people, including people dear to me, so many different things? Resources? Because now I have the make the custard again. My sister's business? Her good name? Her customer's health?\"\n\n(Keeping in mind that there are plenty of allergies where gf could be the source of a cross-contamination. Say, she got into some peanuts first and did not wash her hands.) Because this realistically can happen. That is why there are tons of health and safety regulations when it comes to handling food. In some countries you can't even do it out of your own kitchen, you gotta have a commercial one up to par with the legislations, even if it's outside in a shed, as long as it ticks the boxes.\n\nI mean I guess he can also ask whether she is trying to prove something to someone or is deliberate in her actions of ruining the batches even after OP offered a reasonable compromise. As it was pointed out, jealousy over attention to OP's sister could be a factor, or a \"two birds with one stone\" case.\n\nIn the spirit of Anton Ego from Ratatouille, food is *not* a game. You can play around with it, but you always have to respect it. Yes, I'm also quite frequently angered by the \"food fight\" scenes in movies.\n\n(Or, well, depending on whose place it is, moving out. Or getting a small fridge with a lock.)", "Hmm.

Anyone that endangers my livelihood like that is actually putting my ability to pay my bills in danger and would be out the door so fast their heads would spin.", "I hope you find a solution soon enough. That would be great for you, your sister and her business. I can't imagine the stress of getting a wedding order delayed. Being an entrepreneur, you get so attached to your clients and you want your product to be a center of celebration, not stress for the newlyweds.", "Can you maybe do these at your sisters place? So your girlfriend has no chance of dipping her finger in?", "Honestly, I would consider this worth breaking up over. She's messing with food for others. If someone else got sick because of her nasty nonsense, your sister could face potential liability. Who knows WHAT she does to food when you're not looking.", "Why are you with her? In all seriousness,  she sounds immature and selfish.", "Exactly! She doesn't like you spending time and attention doing something for someone else. She is sabotaging your achievements.
