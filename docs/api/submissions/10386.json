She does a lot of orders for wedding cakes that require custard or marmalade fillings, and I offered to help her out by making these fillings at home and bringing them to her so she has less work to do.\n\nUnfortunately, the past four times I\u2019ve made these fillings, my girlfriend (F24) has literally dipped her fingers into the filling jars and contaminated them because, in her words, she \u201cjust wanted to try some.\u201d I\u2019ve tried explaining to her that she can\u2019t dip her fingers in and contaminate the entire batch, because then I have to remake it. I said she should use a spoon and take some out if she wants to try so bad, but she just pouts and says that she likes using her fingers because it takes her back to her childhood.\n\nToday, I was trying to finish some chocolate custard to send it over to my sister really fast because she was running late on a wedding cake order for an important client. I told my girlfriend beforehand to not eat the custard, and if she really wanted to, to please use a spoon. \n\nI get out of the shower, and what do I see? She has her fingers in it again! I totally lost it because this is the fifth time she blatantly disregarded what I said, and I yelled at her and told her to \u201cstop fucking eating\u201d the food I\u2019m making, because it\u2019s not for her and she\u2019s contaminating it. \n\nShe started crying and got mad at me for \u201cfat-shaming\u201d her, even though I made no comment on her weight and she has no history of weight issues or eating disorders. I know I was harsh, but she kept pushing my limits.

It had nothing to do with her weight and everything to do with her not respecting a boundary you\u2019ve been trying to set that makes PERFECT SENSE. You shouldn\u2019t have to keep wasting your time and money because she keeps contaminating food to sell to other people. You even gave the spoon as a compromise (though she\u2019d probably double and triple dip the spoon). Yelling wasn\u2019t nice, but I understand you\u2019ve been pushed to the breaking point.

I know everyone's like break up! Over every little thing in here but ...I would break up over this.  She is showing a lot about her character by doing this over and over.

Even needing to use a spoon is ridiculous I mean how does she lack such self control? Can she not make more just for her or go buy another treat? It\u2019s for a purpose, to help a business it should not be this hard to not eat some. I think you\u2019ve been nice to say she can have it with a spoon for her to disregard it to be gross is so weird. Imo it also shows that she doesn\u2019t care about your sisters business and that is awful and selfish. \n\nIf you were saying it for her eating in general it would be a different thing obviously, but this isn\u2019t the case & she is projecting her insecurities.", "NTA She is disgusting, disrespectful, and immature.", "NTA. \nBringing back childhood memories isn't an excuse for this nasty behaviour she shows.

You are preparing food to be served to the public, and she is putting her fingers in it, because she wants to pretend she is a child again? Actually, both pathetic and disgusting.

Seriously, I'm sure she has a bunch of wonderful qualities that you adore about her...

You're helping your sister and your gf has zero respect for her or you obviously. You gave her the option of using a spoon and she still used her finger. It was your right to get angry, and nothing you said was fat shaming. Your gf could cause your sister quite a lot of loss of business. Seems likes she's just playing games and blaming you for getting mad at her for things she did wrong. Personally, I would get rid of her. If she can't respect being asked to simply keep her fingers out of the food,  what else will she not respect??", "NTA - you are trying to support your sisters business and already provided sensible boundaries to your gf. She can have a taste but use a spoon to not contaminate it. That is fair enough.\n\nTo ignore that rule more than once is rude. She knows well enough that you have to remake everything which costs time and money.

She has a clear boundary issues, not to mention that she has disgusting habits of sticking her dirty hands into other people\u2019s food and using her childhood as an excuse to her bad behavior. Except she\u2019s a grown woman, not a child. If someone accidentally gets sick from eating the cake, your sister has to take the blame.

I said she should use a spoon and take some out if she wants to try so bad, but she just pouts and says that she likes using her fingers because it takes her back to her childhood.\n\nToday, I was trying to finish some chocolate custard to send it over to my sister really fast because she was running late on a wedding cake order for an important client. I told my girlfriend beforehand to not eat the custard, and if she really wanted to, to please use a spoon. \n\nI get out of the shower, and what do I see? She has her fingers in it again!

I\u2019m guilty of having low self control when it comes to sweet treats but I would never take something especially if my partner asked me not too and definitely not if it was for a real reason & something as significant as helping someone\u2019s livelihood. You have done the right thing and done as much as you can to compromise! So don\u2019t doubt yourself you\u2019ve done all you can do imo", "Honestly at this point, it's on purpose. Idk if it's some kind of weird power play, or she's just still basically a toddler who thinks the world revolves around them, but it's WAY unacceptable. \n\nI'm not sure what other good qualities your gf has that you've continued to date her but... you might wanna reevaluate some things. You deserve to date someone who shows basic respect. NTA", "She's doing it to fuck with you. It sounds like some fucked up power play, doing something you have explicitly and repeatedly asked her not to do. Honestly, I would have dumped her by the third time. Don't buy into her crocodile tears, she's not a fucking child to be acting like this. NTA.", "INFO: Does she normally eat sweet treats like cake etc.? Is she rejecting your sisters baking specifically or does she generally try to limit the amount of cakes/desserts she has?", "The point is not eating it. The point is her desire to sabotage you. That\u2019s why your compromises don\u2019t work with her", "It's like if you want to relive your childhood so bad, just pick your nose and eat it or something. Lol", "Ya, me too; but then at least OP would know she's more interested in hurting him than anything else.", "Yep 100%. Or she would put her fingers into all of them to \u201csee if they taste different.\u201d", "Yeah, this definitely. Your girlfriend is being disgusting, immature, and inconsiderate. You're probably better off without her.", "Yeah, some homes do get special cottage licenses, but that was my initial concern too.", "Do you think it's possible she resents you helping your sister and is deliberately sabotaging you? Because this behavior is just off the charts ridiculous.", "It takes forever to make Anglese! She's sabotaging you. On purpose.", "Also the horror if she dipped a finger sometime and you didn't see.", "Looks like it's about time to dumb the gf. She has zero respect for you and when called out, she whines and plays the victim. \n\nNTA. But you would be TA to yourself, if you stayed with someone so toxic.", "I hope you mean you\u2019ve never sent any over that were there when your GF was in the apartment. I can guarantee she\u2019s done it every time even if you didn\u2019t catch her.", "So sorry, poor you! \n\nI feel bad that it was for an urgent order and you had to redo it on short notice. I hope you are able to knock some sense into her. It's very unempathetic of her if she goes dipping knowing you have to make a batch again and how much effort, time and other resources go into making all that stuff.", "Ok, you keep remaking **all sorts** of sweets... what happens to the batches after she contaminates them? Do you toss them out, or does she take them?", "Demand girlfriend repay you for the lost time", "I hope you charged your gf for the ingredients", "Unsung hero", "OP- this is absolutely a case of her showing you exactly how much respect and care she has for you. Which is none. There is nothing redeeming about this relationship. At its core it can\u2019t be anything but rotten, because she does not and will not respect you. \n\nYou gotta break up", "YES!", "I just commented this and was surprised how far I had to go to find a similar point.", "At that point, she needs to find new living arrangements.", "Most places, you don't even need a permit if you are making under a certain amount of money.", "Same. Maybe 4 then.", "Yeah, and that's fine. But you're not doing it after being asked not to, nor are you doing it then POUTING about it when asked not to/using that as a reason/excuse. Like the fact that this is such a fond memory for her that she can't -help- herself is super concerning.", "Sure it\u2019s petty, and I don\u2019t normally condone getting back at someone but my god she\u2019s like a child. And laxative isn\u2019t poison. I\u2019d make a regular batch and leave her.", "People are allergic to spices, I myself would end up in anaphylactic shock because I\u2019m allergic to several lol laxative seems like a safer approach.", "I think they've misunderstood and assumed the sister and the girlfriend are the same person", "Oh shit, that\u2019s exactly what happened. I see now. I was confused. What in the actual hell?! I would have thrown gf out!", "Even states with cottage kitchen laws have very specific requirements for the kitchen and the exact type of food you\u2019re allowed to produce/sell", "Only if they don\u2019t require refrigeration (at least in most states.) Custards and fruit fillings are supposed to be refrigerated for safety, so that wouldn\u2019t be legal under a cottage food law.", "It's called cottage baking and many states have legalized it.", "As long as she's declaring on the labels that some ingredients may be prepared in a kitchen that is not inspected, she'll likely be fine. Cottage food laws have been expanded in quite a few states in recent years.", "Right? It\u2019s actually super offensive to me that she went there, when that clearly wasn\u2019t at all what he was saying.", "I'm picturing a OP with his face covered in every shade of eyeshadow his fiance owns, halfway through eating a $30 tube of lipstick, asserting in full seriousness that he's doing inner-child work.", "I\u2019d start squeezing the whole bottle out into the sink. Because that\u2019s what my five year does. And she\u2019s behaving at his maturity level.", "Yeeeees! My brother had a period where we would full on eat my mom\u2019s lipsticks.  Just gobble that shit down, and always seemed like the most expensive tubes he could find.  OP, just eat some lipstick as a power move here. ;) \n\nNTA", "The way I learned it in kindergarten was to use a not-contaminated spoon to drop the food onto your personal sampling spoon.", "Oh! I read that super wrong. Thank you!", "No, she just said she likes to eat the plain custard and not the whole cake or pastry. But I told her she could spoon some out and take a little, not dip her fingers in but apparently that compromise is not feasible for her.", "Or does she get to eat the rest of the batch after she contaminates it? Maybe that\u2019s the real motivation", "Yeah, I'm wondering the same thing. Is she somehow threatened by you having a relationship?", "Yes, this sounds like some peeing on territory shit.\n\nOP, you need to get better at redirecting the conversation when someone is trying to manipulate you. You obviously did not fat shame her, but she is trying to guilt you for being upset over wasting your time and materials. \n\nShe knows this is wrong, but instead of confronting that it (you spending time and resources on your sister) bothers her or she struggles with impulse control, it\u2019s easier to make you feel bad\u2026.on top of prioritizing her above your sister\u2019s deadline and your time and resources as well. My guess is she will do this again, showing that she is not mature enough to be in a relationship. At worst case, there\u2019s some sort of jealousy and she\u2019s intentionally sabotaging you instead of having a grown up conversation. At best, she cannot control herself or understand why you cannot lick other people\u2019s dish\u2019s\u2026.and refuses to accept that\u2026.also gross because that will jeopardize any family holiday meal you attempt to cook. \n\nThis is just weird behavior, and I cannot seeing someone being so fantastic that it\u2019s worth keeping them around despite this. Whether it\u2019s impulse or intentional, she chooses to do something that hurts and disrespects your time, resources, and energy.", "The custard sets in such a way that if you try to drag your fingers or a spoon over it no matter how carefully you do it, it will be obvious. \n\nBesides, every time I didn\u2019t have to remake it, it\u2019s because I went to send the custard right after making it so my girlfriend didn\u2019t have a chance to sneak in at take some.", "Exactly my concern", "Exactly! I had to redo the custard so quickly, and then my sister was so stressed and rushing to put the cake together. I\u2019m already worried for my sister because she has pre-hypertension and I\u2019m sure this stress isn\u2019t helping.", "You\u2019re still fucking with food at that point, which is never ok.", "Because this is purposeful. Consciously or subconsciously, she can't stand your attention being focused elsewhere and this negative attention she gets is just as good.\n\nLike a child throwing a tantrum.", "NTA.\n\nThen make the giant baby a bowl of custard just for her to stick her fingers in. Insist on it. But a bowl with her name on it. Treat her like the spoilt petulant child she insists on being.\n\nThe \u201cfat shaming\u201d comment is pure deflection. But it\u2019s also worthwhile having a conversation with her about why she wants to sabotage your sister\u2019s business and your efforts to help. Is she jealous? Is she resenting the time you spend on it with just an offer of a slice of cake as compensation? Does she feel she\u2019s paying for it (cost of ingredients) and so she\u2019s entitled? \n\nThat\u2019s really the only way to solve for this.", "Since you have gone over this with her multiple times it\u2019s safe to say at this point that it\u2019s intentional. Sounds like she is trying to make a point about you having the audacity to tell her \u201cno\u201d.\n\nNTA", "It is intentional. She is on a sick power trip. She is a straight up asshole. Dump her.", "Or she just thinks it's \"quirky\" and \"funny\" and enjoys OP getting worked up over her childish behavior.\n\nSome people just like ticking other people off.\n\nOP should either go the full mile and revoke certain privileges (I dunno, no netflix? No takeouts unless she is paying?) since she insists on playing a child, or have a heart to heart along the following lines -\n\n\"I'm not your father. I'm not your mother. You are an adult, and while I understand that you want to relive your childhood, what you are doing is actively attempting to harm my sister's business and your conduct could make someone very sick, or at worst, dead. Do you want your actions to be the cause of someone's pain? Do you understand that you playing at being chidlish could cost so many different people, including people dear to me, so many different things? Resources? Because now I have the make the custard again. My sister's business? Her good name? Her customer's health?\"\n\n(Keeping in mind that there are plenty of allergies where gf could be the source of a cross-contamination. Say, she got into some peanuts first and did not wash her hands.) Because this realistically can happen. That is why there are tons of health and safety regulations when it comes to handling food. In some countries you can't even do it out of your own kitchen, you gotta have a commercial one up to par with the legislations, even if it's outside in a shed, as long as it ticks the boxes.\n\nI mean I guess he can also ask whether she is trying to prove something to someone or is deliberate in her actions of ruining the batches even after OP offered a reasonable compromise. As it was pointed out, jealousy over attention to OP's sister could be a factor, or a \"two birds with one stone\" case.\n\nIn the spirit of Anton Ego from Ratatouille, food is *not* a game. You can play around with it, but you always have to respect it. Yes, I'm also quite frequently angered by the \"food fight\" scenes in movies.\n\n(Or, well, depending on whose place it is, moving out. Or getting a small fridge with a lock.)", "Hmm. Interesting.", "Could be eating custard out of the trash, sounds compulsive.", "This question would make sense if it were the sister sabotaging food meant for the girlfriend's business, but it's the other way around.", "I own a small business myself and if someone was ACTIVELY sabotaging my work at any stage I would be a lot less kind than you have been. Anyone that endangers my livelihood like that is actually putting my ability to pay my bills in danger and would be out the door so fast their heads would spin.", "I hope you find a solution soon enough. That would be great for you, your sister and her business. I can't imagine the stress of getting a wedding order delayed. Being an entrepreneur, you get so attached to your clients and you want your product to be a center of celebration, not stress for the newlyweds.", "Can you maybe do these at your sisters place? So your girlfriend has no chance of dipping her finger in?", "Honestly, I would consider this worth breaking up over. She's messing with food for others. If someone else got sick because of her nasty nonsense, your sister could face potential liability. Who knows WHAT she does to food when you're not looking.", "Why are you with her? In all seriousness,  she sounds immature and selfish.", "Exactly! She doesn't like you spending time and attention doing something for someone else. She is sabotaging your achievements. After warning her 5 times and giving her alternative ways to eat some it's time you don't have her in the kitchen at all. Toddlers get time outs. Personally I'd have broken up with her for her blatant disrespect. NTA\n\nEdit add NTA", ">\tThat\u2019s really the only way to solve for this.\n\nI don\u2019t think it will solve it. OP\u2019s girlfriend is deliberately sabotaging OPs work. My guess is that girlfriend dies not like when someone, besides her, gets OP\u2019s attention. Girlfriend is jealous of OPs\u2019 sister.", "I wanted to help my sister out directly in her bakery\u2019s kitchen, but it\u2019s way too small and short on equipment. She\u2019s currently saving up for a renovation so she has more kitchen space. Hopefully, then I will be able to help her directly in the bakery.", "I have seen some weird posts on here from girlfriends who are jealous of the guy\u2019s sister. It\u2019s possible.", "Could you maybe go to her house/apartment and work there? That way your girlfriend still won\u2019t have access? (That being said it is ridiculous that you even have to go to such lengths.)"]}
