Telling you he hates you for not liking the hair is beyond immature.", "NTA and honestly if you've only started dating this guy I would take this as the red flag that it is. \n\nBeing sensitive about his work isn't the issue. We can all be. Being upset that something (anything) didn't go as he planned isn't a problem either. It happens to all of us. \n\nThe issue is this: \n\n* He refused to accept that you genuinely liked the first result (even if it wasn't what he intended) and pretty much forced your hand into agreeing to another dye --I'm aware he didn't put a gun to your head, but he certainly pushed you. \n* He very likely screwed up the second dye but if he didn't that's still bad (you agreed to light brown, not black), and when your reaction was understandably not super positive, he begun a very obvious and tiring guilt trip to make YOU feel bad and apologize for HIS screw up. \n\nThat kind of twisted emotional manipulation over something relatively unimportant as a hair makeover (I know it's not nothing, but in the grand scheme of things hair isn't all that relevant), is a warning sign. \n\nThis guy is not emotionally well-balanced. As a boyfriend he's more than likely to be toxic. \n\nNot to mention, his out-of-the-blue suggestion to alter your appearance to his liking is a bit concerning as well. \n\nI wouldn't apologize to him at all. And I'd seriously reconsider dating him.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you wanna stay with this guy after he said he hates you?\n\nThis is abuse patterns 101.", "NTA\n\nIts a terribly toxic behavior to become upset at someone for being upset at you.\n\nHe tried really hard it seems but the result is sub-par. He could internalize that and work on apologizing and improving his craft, however he has chosen to project his anger at you... the person who has to live (literally) with his failure on your head.\n\nI'd sit him down and explain your displeasure at the hair dye and his response and demand that he apologize.\n\nIf he won't then I would just move on.", "NTA.  Dude is insecure about his work and is pushing those insecurities on you.  That\u2019s a toxic manifestation of that insecurity. \n\nHair is one of the few body parts most people have total control over \u2014 it\u2019s a powerful symbolic feature.  At the end of the day you shouldn\u2019t be made to feel bad about something that would reasonably upset any person, regardless of who those feelings are directed at, so long as you don\u2019t become T A in your response.\n\nFinally, I will also supplement my answer by preemptively stating: No, your relationship isn\u2019t doomed or over, per se.  None of us have enough context to make a propensity judgement.  Though this is a significant red flag from the way I\u2019ve interpreted it.", "NTA and he's clearly not a particularly competent hairdresser. Instead of trying to learn from his mistakes and improve himself he's gaslighting you and making it your problem.", "Honey he fucked up your hair and tried to convince you otherwise. You are NOT the asshole.", "NTA all day.\n\nYou are DEFINITELY allowed to have your own opinions about your own hair.\n\nHe told you he was giving you light brown, and gave you black. And then he lays down a thick layer of emotional blackmail.\n\nYou need to ask him if black was the intended result: and if so, why did he mislead you?\n\nLook for other signs of controlling behavior; does he order your food when you go out, overruling your desires?\n\nBetween the trying to change you two months in (although with him being a stylist, which is the impression I got, he may look at everyone as a canvas for his artistry) and the emotional blackmail, I've got concerns.", "NTA but cut your losses and go your separate ways now. That guy is immature, controlling, emotionally manipulative and just...too much.", "NTA, so sorry about your hair, you took it better than I would\u2019ve. I\u2019d stop this relationship doesn\u2019t sound like he values you or your opinion at all.", "Why tf are you apologising for him fucking up your hair. YTA for that alone.", "NTA- he was the one who offered to do your hair, then insisted on doing it again even after you said you like the first colour he did. Now he's berating you because you don't like the new style he insisted on doing which isn't anything like you asked for. Dump this childish as hell man, you will never win being in a relationship with a person like this. They will always find a way to turn it conflict/disagreement around on you and make you the bad guy.", "NTA.  This is abuse.  He did this on purpose - he would not have a job if he was actually that bad at it.  He wanted to make you to look a certain way and tricked you into letting him.\n\nI dyed my own hair for years, and I can tell you that what he did on the first dye job was a complete rookie mistake - this should have been a two-step process, first lighten the hair, check that you\u2019ve achieved that, then apply new color, with a violet tone added in to cancel out the red.  You can\u2019t just put brown over red unless it\u2019s much darker, and you\u2019d still end up with some reddish undertones.  You can\u2019t lighten even neutral brown without correcting for the red; you end up with Cheeto orange.  \n\nYou also have to be really careful with hair that has been dyed repeatedly and recently - the cuticle is more porous than on \u201cvirgin\u201d hair or hair that\u2019s had some time and some repairing treatments since last dye.  If you use the same strength developer and the same time to set on very processed hair as on hair in better repair, you\u2019re going to get a much darker, more intense, very uneven color (darker at the ends).  \n\nAre these all easy mistakes, yes (I learned by making them!).  Are they anything I\u2019d expect from a professional, hell no.  If he did this to paying customers the salon would be giving them their money back, and/or having another stylist fix it, and they would be losing money.  \n\nAdd in that he\u2019s emotionally manipulative - he\u2019s angry that you like the one color because he doesn\u2019t, then angry that you don\u2019t like the next because he does?  Whose hair is this?  He thinks it\u2019s his, as in you\u2019re his canvas and should be grateful.  And he\u2019s got you apologizing for *his* reactions! \n\nThis is all a big old nope, red flag, alarm bells going off, proceed directly to the exits.  You deserve better, and so does your hair.", "NTA. I am a hairstylist, so I'm going to come wt this from my personal perspective. These are big red flags here. He decided he wanted your hair to be a different color, kind of wierd, but ok, he offered and you accepted. It was a color you wrre happy with. Even if it isn't what I wanted to end up with, I would be completely happy with that outcome. Instead he gets mad and has you come to the salon. Now I don't know how he went about this on a technical level, but something isn't adding up for me here. There is no way your hair ends up black on accident. He cannot be a competent hairstylist in any case. Either he used Lightner in your hair to lift it, then somehow toned with a black toner, or he used a completely wrong color and went darker instead of lifting a level or two. Either way, incorrect, and bad. Then instead of apologizing or using one of the MANY methods to try and undo some of the damage, he gives up and gets mad at you. This is a big problem. But while I don't know the details of this relationship, he's giving you all the signs you should not continue with it.", "NTA at all even if it was the agreed upon color. This does not seem like a person I would want in my life.", "NTA, this dude lost several marbles.  He is a hair dresser but is surprised when someone who is expecting light brown but gets black hair is upset and in shock? It's literally his job. He did not do what what was discussed and changed a part of you without discussing it first. That is disrespectful. What is also disrespectful is him throwing your emotions back at you as if it is your fault that you are upset. This was not a reason to hang out, dude took control of a part of you and is trying to condition you to take it as is. (Maybe unconsciously, but that is still what he is doing). You can find someone who respects you.", "NTA, but stop talking to this guy. And for the love of everything, NO MORE APOLOGIZING! You didn't do anything wrong, he did. You don't have anything to apologize for, he does. He ruined your hair (I suspect deliberately) and immediately became verbally abusive when he felt \"called out\". He told you he hates you because you don't appreciate him ruining your hair? Wtf? \n\nSeriously, cut this guy loose and don't look back. This behavior will only escalate.", "NTA. As soon as that \u201ci hate you right now\u201d came out of his mouth, we would have been done", "NTA. He\u2019s not a good boyfriend or a good hairstylist. Don\u2019t go back to the man or the salon.", "You are asking the wrong question.\n\nThis has NOTHING to do with you liking your new hair color or not. This has to do with how this guy treated you, especially knowing this is what he does for a living. \n\nHe told you he was dying it LIGHT BROWN. The first attempt YOU LIKED but he did not. So then he disregarded your opinion and wanted to \"fix\" it, never telling you that it would be MUCH DARKER THAN YOU AGREED TO. \n\nThe fact that he thinks it looks good on you is irrelevant.  You are unhappy with his work and THAT is what he is angry about, but you have EVERY right to be disappointed and upset. \n\nThen he is laying all of this guilt trip on you when you never asked him to do this HE OFFERED.\n\nCapping it with \"I hate you right now\"\n\nThis is just a preview of things to come. Break it off with him and do not look back.\n\nNTA", "NTA and you need to leave. This isn\u2019t someone you should have in your life. If he had done the color wrong on accident and apologized profusely then fine. He didn\u2019t. He refused to believe you that you liked his first try (makes me wonder if he thought you\u2019d hate it and when you didn\u2019t he had to be more drastic) so he did it again and seriously messed up. Then blew up at you like you had no right to be mad. If you\u2019d shaved his head without it consent, would he be ok with it? Probably not. Massive red flags. Leave while you\u2019re still in the beginning. It will get worse.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
