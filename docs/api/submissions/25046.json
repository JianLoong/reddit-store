{"id": 25046, "submission_id": "15vqq9y", "title": "AITA for telling my sisters to go the fuck home?", "selftext": "As the title says, I (20F) told my sisters, (24F and 33F) to go the fuck home. I feel like it was warranted. I\u2019ve been having a rough week, I just started a new job and found out there had been some drama over people talking about my autism behind my back and all I wanted was a day to myself to just relax before a busy week next week. I thought I\u2019d bake my boyfriend some brownies for our anniversary so I text my 24F sister asking for advice as she and my bf both have a gluten intolerance and I\u2019ve never baked anything gluten free before. \n\nI started baking and I suddenly hear them incessantly knocking at the door, so I unlock it and tell them to just knock once next time because it\u2019s annoying for them to do that when they can see me in the window. As I\u2019m baking, they go into the living room, turn off my music and put YouTube videos on for my five-year-old niece, which was a little annoying but I didn\u2019t mind as she is only a kid. They then started taking the piss out of me for making my boyfriend brownies then 24F took over the entire baking process because apparently I wasn\u2019t doing it right. 33F kept eating the cooking chocolate which I asked her not to do as well.\n\nWhen they were in the oven, my sisters kept asking me about my job and every time I\u2019d answer they\u2019d laugh at me (not sure why). When I got them out of the oven, they needed to go back in. I had to check them about four times, but every time I did my sisters both had to make some comments about it and I couldn\u2019t tell whether they were making fun of me or not. Eventually it got to the point where I was sick of them laughing so I told them to go home and they both got mad at me. My niece started crying and I told her it wasn\u2019t her fault, but 33F told me they were just trying to have a laugh with me so it\u2019s not their fault either. \n\nPersonally I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anybody\u2019s fault, I think I\u2019m just a bit overwhelmed by everything right now but I don\u2019t think my sisters respect my boundaries at all. I had already told them multiple times today that I didn\u2019t want to do anything because they asked me if I wanted to go to the park, but like I\u2019ve said, I didn\u2019t want to, I was tired. I just feel bad because I put it so bluntly and I think it upset my sisters because 33F got defensive saying they weren\u2019t laughing at me, they were laughing \u201cwith\u201d me and 24F said \u201cas always it was nice to see you\u201d kind of sardonically. Plus my niece cried.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1692476984, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vqq9y/aita_for_telling_my_sisters_to_go_the_fuck_home/", "score": 306, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were right to send them packing.", "NTA. These people aren't necessarily AHs, but they need to understand what you're going through right now. By what you're saying, it doesn't sound like they gave particularly good 'advice' either. They need to understand that people have different boundaries and not everyone finds what they did funny. Hope the brownies turned out well!", "NTA.\n\nIt's not fault per se? But they were pretty AH-ish towards you. Were they high or something? They sound high and self absorbed. Have they don't this before? But yeah, NTA. That's just some weird way of \"having a laugh with you\". Like... uhm...?", "NTA - They were making fun of you, they were acting like they can just come into your home and take over when they feel like you're \"doing it wrong\" instead of doing what you asked, and once they finally got told off, suddenly it's you who's the problem? No, they're acting entitled to your time, and your energy, and rudely acting up. Good on you for telling them off.", "Nta you never even asked them to come over you asked for advice and they disrespected you to your face in your own home your sisters are bullies use google next time since they obviously don\u2019t know how to advise without judgment", "Were you laughing when they were laughing with you? No. They sound very childish, annoying & give off mean girl vibes. \n\nKeep practicing on your brownies & your cooking, you\u2019ll get there.", "NTA. \n\nHowever, it feels like you should have communicated at the door that now wasn\u2019t a good time. Family can be pushy and overwhelming especially when you\u2019re not comfortable and they are. \n\nThe entire episode seems like a miscommunication.", "You most certainly are NTA.  At some point bullies need to be confronted and barred from bothering you again.  Bravo for you!", "NTA. Your home is your safe space. Your house your rules. Maybe get a doorbell camera setup so that you can see who is outside before opening the door. You never have to let someone who is going to make things harder on you in. Doubly so if they weren\u2019t invited, don\u2019t live there and gave no prior warning.\n\nHopefully the niece crying didn\u2019t cause any sensory issues. ADHD is not autism but sometimes loud noises are just too much, and your home is where you know what sensory triggers there are for sure. You let your guard down more at home, i think everyone with the luxury of having their won space does.\n\nI\u2019m going to be honest, I would have tossed them out the second they crossed an established boundary. It\u2019s not OK, they don\u2019t get a pass because they are family. It\u2019s also a horrible example for niece, she has seen you be insulted even as a joke. Small kids can\u2019t really tell yet, and this could shape her thinking for years about you.", "NTA. At best, your sisters weren\u2019t paying attention to your clear cues that you weren\u2019t enjoying or wanting this interaction. At worst, they were being deliberately unkind. They certainly sound like they took over something you wanted to do yourself, not to mention invading your house, turning your music off without asking, eating things you asked them not to\u2026..Your sisters did not show respect for you in this, and you were absolutely in the right to ask them to go home. Keep communicating boundaries to them as firmly as possible (I know it\u2019s hard - I have one of my own who still sometimes makes me feel bad when I hold firm to a boundary they don\u2019t agree with).", "[deleted]", "They wanted laugh time with you? That means they came to laugh at you. What horrible people. NTA", "This is tough. Your post says you don't really know why they were laughing and a lot of people here are saying they were laughing at you. But honestly,  there  just isn't enough context and I recognise in you a difficulty to infer from context and pick up on what people are trying to do. I have this difficulty sometimes too but to a lesser extent and I'm nearly 40 so I have learnt how my brain works a little. \n\nIf we can look from the outside and instead of assuming the worst of your sisters, let's try to assume the best. People on here have already assumed the worst, so it may help to look at it from another angle. \n\nPerhaps they came over to help you. They knew you had never baked gluten free before. You are their little sister and they want to look out for you. They want to be there with you after a difficult week. We don't know exactly why they were laughing but we can infer that they didn't know just how stressed you were, and just how much they were triggering you. \n\nIt can be hard to understand but people often laugh at others mistakes in a non-malicious way. It's a way of relieving the embarrassment from a situation and allowing that person to laugh at themselves. My husband and I still laugh about the time before we were dating where I took a plastic cup of nuts wrapped in cling film travelling with me to Europe. I thought it was a good solution to having no Tupperware. He thought I was crazy and joked about it. We both laughed as I realised that it actually isn't normal behaviour and he meant no harm in laughing about it. He usually knows what I can be sensitive about and doesn't laugh at me for those things. And i am a overly-sensitive person. \n\nAll this to say, that people that love us sometimes don't realise they are crossing a line because they are comfortable with us. \n\nYou are perfectly within your right to say to them that no, you don't want their help and need space from everyone to decompress. They should respect that, and if they don't the  they are the AHs. But, you need to clearly express your needs to them. You need to let them know you are triggered when they bang on the door and switch off your music. That you don't want to snap at them, but are very overwhelmed right now and need space. \n\nIt's hard to judge this. Of cpurse your sisters really could have come round just to put you down. If they have a history of bullying you to make themselves feel better, then maybe that is the case. But something about your middle sister's bitter exit (uncalled for from her btw) tells me that they are trying to connect with you somehow. Perhaps they don't understand your autism as well as they should. \n\nI would explain to them your situation (work, wanting to have time to yourself and be independent). I would also explain that you truely did not understand what they were laughing at, and ask them to explain. Make a plan going forward to be firm with boundaries with them and ask them to be understanding. \n\nNTA or NAH", "NTA. You mention you have autism. you sound like you were already stretched thin emotionally from work and then people turn up unexpectedly, upending your plans, and keep talking to you rather than letting you just exist to process your day and recharge. \n\nIf your sisters are close they should accept your boundaries and that includes alone time to recharge. Now, if they are NTs they may have thought if it was a stressful week they wanted to help you relax and forget it, not realising that is unlikely to help somebody with ASD who might need that alone time.\n\nI think I'd have snapped.", "You\u2019re always allowed to set boundaries in your life.", "NTA. They showed up unannounced, for one, and if your autism is like mine, that would fuck my mood up right then and there.", "NTA\n\nThey were laughing at you not with you, since you weren't laughing ....", "No, what they were doing was belittling you and being abusive by bullying you in your own home.\n\nNTA, and don't invite them back", "[deleted]", "NTA", "NTA - your sisters were intentionally annoying you, for their own amusement.", "NTA! They don\u2019t respect you at all, anyone who says we\u2019re laughing with you not at you are liars. They sound awful to deal with", "NTA you are allowed to have boundaries", "NTA don't let them in next time", "NTA\n\nThey sound rude and inconsiderate.\n\nSome people just have a bubble of noise, confusion, and nonsense that follows them wherever they go.", "NTA. Not even a little bit. To review, they:  \n\n\n1. Barged into your home uninvited\n2. Tried to take over something you were making for your boyfriend\n3. Made fun of you for cooking for your boyfriend.\n4. Make fun of you for talking about your job.\n5. Gaslight you when you're finally sick of it and claim they're trying to laugh \\*with\\* you, but since you weren't laughing, it proves them false.\n6. Get huffy when you show them to the door.\n7. Make you feel bad for their behavior.\n\nNext time they come knocking uninvited, tell them you're busy and to go away. Your sisters are bullies and are not entitled to overstep your boundaries.", "I don't think there are any assholes here. It's obvious your sisters like spending time with you - but it's also understandable that you weren't in the right frame of mind for sisterly hijinks. From what I've read, it seems like you have a loving relationship with them, and this will resolve itself.", "A friend of mine uses this response:\n\nMeanie: \"We're not laughing \\*at\\* you; we're laughing \\*with\\* you.\"\n\nFriend: \"I'm not laughing.\"", "I just feel bad because we\u2019re very close as sisters and I upset them", "Thank you, they are terrible haha, the middle is all gooey, it\u2019s like cookie dough. My boyfriend said he\u2019s gonna try and improve them with me because this is the first time I\u2019ve baked gluten free treats", "Sometimes they can be a bit mean, like they will make jokes at my expense a lot, but they\u2019re usually nice I think", "Oh I would use google, I just hate having to scroll through an entire novel to get to the recipe - why do recipe bloggers feel the need to put their memoirs before the actual content is beyond me", "Thank you!! I think my cooking is okay, I love to cook - I have been since I was 11 hehe, but baking is just a mystery. \n\nI did say they were being mean girls, and to be honest, I said it as a joke but neither of them were laughing so I think I messed up the tone or they were just already mad at me. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just glad it\u2019s now peaceful", "Thank you, I will take that as advice for next time (I didn\u2019t know you didn\u2019t have to let people in your home if they\u2019re at your door)", "I never even considered the effect it could have on my niece but tbh 33F (her mum) is already teaching her to breach my personal boundaries. I don\u2019t like physical touch that much, so instead of hugs, I told my niece to give me high fives and told her a little bit about autism and why she should high five me, and she doesn\u2019t mind it. Her mum keeps egging her on to hug me though and kept doing it before and I just think it\u2019s not a good example to set for someone her age, especially when that\u2019s coupled with them making fun of me", "Thank you, I\u2019m gonna work on building boundaries more to be honest because I think this (and the comments I\u2019ve received here) have shown me I struggle to set them and should be more firm", "I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand", "What do you mean? I don\u2019t really understand", "Thank you for this. To be honest, I think a lot of the comments are a bit overly negative, but at the same time I don\u2019t really know why they were making fun of me for loving my boyfriend and making him brownies. 24F has recently broken up with her boyfriend so maybe that\u2019s why she felt the need to take over(?) and the 33F is an extrovert (I\u2019m a huge introvert) so I don\u2019t think she realises sometimes when she\u2019s overstepping social boundaries. I don\u2019t really understand the laughing because tbh I didn\u2019t make a terrible mistake, I was mostly just checking if they were done, but they found that really funny and it was annoying me. Now that I\u2019ve had time to think about it and stuff I don\u2019t think they came over to make fun of me, I think they were a bit hyper and wanted to see me but I wasn\u2019t feeling it and then they made fun of me (which isn\u2019t a one off thing)", "They are NTs but one studied psychology at uni, got a first and now works with autistic people 5 days a week, whereas the other works in a school and often has autistic kids in her class. I have suspected for a while that neither of them really care about how I experience autism, they just like to use it as a token", "Oh it kind of did fuck my mood up. I had been playing minecraft all day (current hyperfixation as my bf and I just started a server and since he hasn\u2019t played in about 8 years, I\u2019ve been trying to set it up so we can explore the new stuff), and I was feeling pretty happy. Then I wanted to bake, like I said but them showing up was just a big distraction that threw my night off", "I don\u2019t think I was clear!! I didn\u2019t invite them over, they just showed up while I was in the middle of baking - I texted for advice on what gluten free substitute would be good", "She got mad that they were not listening to her and that they were constantly laughing at everything she did or said you sound like just as much of a bully as the sisters she asked for advice not for three uninvited house guests", "Your comprehension skills suck. She didn\u2019t invite them over. She called one sister to ask for advice, they took over and invited themselves and started being mean to OP.", "They were NOT invited. \n\nShe asked one of the sisters for advice so she didn't accidentally make her partner ill and they showed up,  cop-knocking and invited themselves in.", "And what about you being upset? That somehow doesn't count...?", "No; you are not very close with them.  They are close with each other and let you in from time to time.  :(", "Nope, their behavior here is pretty clearly terrible. You texted asking for *advice*, not *help*, then BOTH of them come WITH A YOUNG CHILD and then 24f takes over the baking? It's like they think you're completely useless. It's wildly inappropriate.", "While siblings can be mean to each other on occasions, as per my fianc\u00e9e has told me (I'm an only child), this right here isn't sibling meanness. It sounds like they were high, I swear. I've had friends arrive home acting like this, high on sugar, caffeine, or weed or drunk. And I've had to do the same thing, shove them out the door with a \"sober up and call me when you get home!\".  \nBut if they weren't, they were just being plain horrible and you did the right thing.", "I don\u2019t get it either and it\u2019s frustrating I can\u2019t eat sugar so finding recipes is difficult for me but my siblings are the same way they will make snide comments about me not only when we are alone but even in public or when family is visiting just last week my brother had a problem with me eating a hotdog at a family barbecue so I just threw my whole plate away and went to my grandma\u2019s room ( it was her house) and stayed there until my carpool wanted to leave but if I hadn\u2019t done that he would have tried to actually fight me and there were children around he out weighs me by almost 100 pounds and I\u2019m female so he has a clear advantage but somehow I\u2019m found as the aggressor so it would\u2019ve been a lose lose situation hope you have better luck with your siblings", "They kinda took over your house, tv & kitchen. Then they get upset with you bc you seemed to be overwhelmed? It sound like They definitely were not respecting you or your boundaries. \n\nBaking takes practice & you\u2019ll have plenty of burnt stuff. May I suggest getting some chicken, bc they will eat anything, lol.\n\nI\u2019ve been cooking since 8 & probably baking since 11. I\u2019m 55 now. I still occasionally burn when baking. My husband says it\u2019s just burnt on the bottom. \n\nCookbooks, YouTube & google tutorials will help a lot too.", "Can I ask what your heritage is? In some cultures it\u2019s taught differently about letting people in.", "Sorry I have neuropathy and flipped on wrong post", "Yeah. There are very few people even amongst those I love and care about that can get away with an unannounced visit. Plus, they brought your niece. I love my little cousins (10 & 12) but damn, kids are loud and I get the sensory overload if I can\u2019t prepare for it.", "You were clear, this guy just doesn't have good reading comprehension.\n\nOP I want you to consider that maybe your sisters are bullying you a little bit. This sounds like a pattern. You are NTA for standing up for yourself.", "You were actually perfectly clear - it was easy to understand they came over uninvited. But some redditors don't read well. You are fine.", "I don\u2019t think your sisters came over with baked goods with the intention to mock you and break your boundaries. They were likely upset because it sounds like you were overwhelmed and were not good company. Sure, they may have been assholes for making fun of you, but you need to primarily consider their intentions and their reasons for coming over to see you.", "I mean you have a point, I just don\u2019t really think about my emotions because if I voice them I get told I\u2019m being dramatic", "Tbh, I am kind of useless at baking lol, the brownies are liquid in the middle. I told my bf and he said he\u2019ll try them and teach me how to make them better at least", "I don\u2019t think they were high haha, us three don\u2019t really take substances because our parents are alcoholics", "Oh god that\u2019s awful! I hope you\u2019re okay!!\n\nAnd for me it\u2019s kind of like off handed things. It does mess me up mentally, like my 24F kept telling me I shouldn\u2019t be losing weight. I struggle to eat large portions of food because I\u2019m on antidepressants and birth control which can both suppress your appetite, and she once sat down and practically force fed me my dinner by saying if I don\u2019t finish the plate, she\u2019s putting me in the car and taking me to get diagnosed with an ED", "Thank you!! I use the bosh cook books (I\u2019m vegetarian trying to transition to vegan in the next two years) but it\u2019s having to do coeliac friendly recipes for my boyfriend which can be hard. We always revert to rice haha\n\nAnd yeah putting it into the perspective that they took over things makes a lot of sense. 24F even took the mixer and spatula because she felt like baking after taking over my recipe :/", "Oh yeah, I\u2019m white and British - specifically from the north west so it\u2019s kind of friendly around here (depending on who you ask).", "It\u2019s okay!! Hope you find the post you were looking for :))", "Yup, my niece is especially loud, it\u2019s like she\u2019s a foghorn with legs. I love her, but she is too much sometimes, and she especially was today. For example, she kept asking to listen to really annoying songs then she would crawl around me whilst I\u2019m baking (specifically when I was melting chocolate with a pan full of boiling water in hand) and then she kept making me go watch her do cartwheels. She also kept screaming because nobody would dance with her", "I mean, they make fun of me a fair bit, and don\u2019t do it to each other. I assume it\u2019s because I\u2019m the weird one in our family, but idk. It doesn\u2019t matter too much moving forward because after university I\u2019ll be moving across the country and I doubt my family are gonna want to visit me. I don\u2019t think I matter that much in our familial infrastructure tbqh", "It is a good point to consider their intentions, but I told them a few times today that I didn\u2019t want to do anything because I\u2019m tired after an 11 hour shift yesterday. They came over unannounced while I was baking because they thought I\u2019d be lonely (because my parents went on a last minute drinking binge somewhere and left me home alone for the weekend) but I wasn\u2019t, I had plans to do laundry, wash my hair and play minecraft with my bf after I was finished", "That's not okay at all!! Your feelings are valid. You might wanna reconsider what you told me about being put down by them and you three being close.", "Legit sounds like what happens with my gf and her sister and mom. She feels guilty for hurting their feelings after standing up for herself and boundaries and disregards how it was justified by their actions. It isn\u2019t easy to do and does take an emotional toll but it needs to happen sometimes.", "Op they are gaslighting the shit out of you. Your sisters are sucky people. When someone makes you feel bad you should let them know that their behavior is making you uncomfortable and if they continue to mess with you quit interacting with them or get pissed", "You're nor \"useless\" baking, you just need practice, nobody's born knowing. It sounds like you've been put down by those two quite a bit. I hope I'm wrong, tho.", "Well good. It just such weird behaviour from adults. x'D You're still NTA, tho.", "Happy baking & cooking!", "Gotcha that makes sense. Was just wondering due to Latin heritage being it\u2019s unheard of not to let someone in the house if they\u2019re at the door lol", "You're going to make a great and happy life for yourself, I know it. Leave those losers in the dust.", "Maybe you\u2019re right a little, but we still are close. One took me in last year when my parents were abusing me and the police had to remove me from the house, and the other one used to save me from my parents beatings. We do have a good sibling bond, it\u2019s just sometimes they are mean to me", "You\u2019re right! I think it\u2019s important for me as well because I have autism and some simple boundaries like \u201cdon\u2019t touch my stuff\u201d get broken, and it can cause me to have a meltdown. From this point on I\u2019m gonna try and be more firm, it\u2019s my mid-year resolution haha", "You\u2019re right! I think it\u2019s important for me as well because I have autism and some simple boundaries like \u201cdon\u2019t touch my stuff\u201d get broken, and it can cause me to have a meltdown. From this point on I\u2019m gonna try and be more firm, it\u2019s my mid-year resolution haha", "Nah definitely not put down by them - this is my first time making any gluten free bake. I\u2019m good at cooking, just not baking. 24F is good at baking which is probably why she took over what I was doing, but she did it in school too", "Oh we\u2019re a weird family haha", "I didn\u2019t know that was specifically a Latin thing! But yeah I just didn\u2019t know, either because of how I was raised or just what it\u2019s like around me (people inviting you in for a cuppa and some digestives as you talk over Tipping Point - british \u201cculture\u201d is rather odd)", "Ah that\u2019s been my thoughts for a while now. As much as I love my sisters, I think having the distance would be better off for me because I feel so much more like myself when I\u2019m around my boyfriend and in a different city", "Okay, I suggest you all go to therapy. By the sounds of this you have a ton of things to work through. Good luck", "It\u2019s not easy, and my gf herself has an anxiety disorder. I\u2019d talk to a therapist about how to go about it in the best way for you however. It\u2019s good to have them as a sounding board. Or your boyfriend for that matter who sounds like a wonderful guy.", "So? They're being Ash's about it.... I think you need to view this from another perspective.", "I think the person is referring to how you take casual digs at yourself in your replies like someone with low self esteem.", "I think it varies on region in the UK from my understanding but I\u2019m an American so I have no true way of knowing", "Oh thank you!! I\u2019ve tried three types of therapy so far and I\u2019m doing quite well - my favourite is art therapy and my partner is so supportive with it all - he even has a canvas of one of my paintings :))", "Yeah I think my boyfriend will help for now. I have a therapist in my university so I don\u2019t really have a way of contacting her during summer breaks and stuff. But my bf is usually quite understanding about this sort of stuff, he knows I\u2019m close with my sisters but he also knows how much they can overstep", "Oh no it definitely does!! I think it\u2019s kind of based on our regions and our economic divides, for example somewhere like Devon will have a middle-to-upper class population and is more likely to have stereotypical brits because of its aging population, whereas Yorkshire has a very homely atmosphere. To me, I\u2019d see it as comparing a scone to a steak and ale pie - if that makes any sense", "Art therapy is amazing. I'm an illustrator and vent art has saved me countless times.", "That\u2019s great! Well I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve got him in your life! Yeah that\u2019s the one downside of the university therapist.

A kind of smaller soothing behaviour I picked up is focusing on an object and describing in detail the colours in it.

And then you need to stick to it. You can reassess boundaries periodically if needed.", "NTA\n\nComing over without checking first when you made it clear you needed to relax was rude of them. Mocking you is fucking disgusting. The difference between laughing at and laughing with is not your intent, it's whether or not the other person it laughing, and it doesn't sound like you were laughing. At that point, telling them to fucking leave rather than calling them rude names or screaming at them IS being polite and reasonable.\n\nYou were overwhelmed. You might have handled the situation more rationally/nicely if you weren't or at least put up with it better/for longer. But the thing about your tolerance for other people's bs and rudeness being reduced is that it only becomes an issue if people around you act in a way that forces you to tolerate them, rather than being respectful or making sure you enjoy being with them. So this was, entirely, their fault and trying to assign no blame here seems like some stuff from your past (you mentioned being told that expressing emotions was called overreacting in a comment, which it isn't) which could be making you misread the situation in a way that might be harmful to yourself. Set boundaries for yourself, enforce them, and if necessary enforce them again.

I hope your new job goes well. \n\nNTA", "Sounds like the communication and social skill cuing was very off here. \nFirst, they failed to ask if you needed their support.\nSecond, they failed to ask if it was alright to come over.\nThird, they failed to notice that their homes weren't landing and just kept trying instead of adapting or moving on. Fourth, they failed to respect your wishes surrounding your baking ingredients and process. \nYou are nta for getting frustrated, as anyone would at that point. Obviously, as neurotypicals, they need to really work harder to hone their communication and social cue skills.", "NTA but your sister are totally TA you said you didn\u2019t want to see them and they showed up to your place anyway than proceeded to take over and make fun of you. They are very much TA.", "OP, speaking from the point of view of an older sister, we older siblings can be AHs at times. We sometimes find it hard to get it in our heads that our younger siblings are grown adults and deserve respect because in our minds there will always be a part of us that views you guys as little kids. Granted, in my case it is out of love and protectiveness, and while I don't bully my little sister, I still feel that this is something that I need to consistently work on. It is hard for us to get over that older sister complex, but it has to be done if we want a good relationship with our younger siblings. Younger siblings DESERVE respect. \n\nOP, you haven't been shown much respect (from the post), so you shouldn't feel bad about getting upset. It was justified. Your sisters are AHs for picking on you. NTA OP.", "You\u2019re autistic", "It is never okay for someone to come in your home and disrupt your peace.

You are going to end up in an endless cycle of autistic burn out when your emotions aren't being dealt with. PUT YOU FIRST AND FOREMOST. Having a disability is exhausting and you need to make sure you are taken care of before you can take care of others. \n\nYou are NTA at all in this situation. Your sisters were being awful towards you and they were not laughing with you, they were laughing at you. They may be some of the ones talking crap behind your back. They may not be the nice people you thought they were. And as an autistic person you should not put up with that because it just causes more pain and exhaustion. I know it's hard but for your own sake you need to be extremely firm with your boundaries and you need to be extremely rigid on the treatment you will be willing to accept from others. If you let your sisters continue to treat you like that it will only get worse since people love to take advantage of people like us and treat us less than. You deserve better. I am not saying to cut them out but I'm saying you need to learn to defend your boundaries very harshly and defend yourself since we easily let mistreatment get swept under the rug or we completely misunderstand it and think it's something more innocent than it actually is.\n\nI'm so sorry you are experiencing this. You deserve so much better.", "I am also on both antidepressants and birth control my cramps were so severe they caused bruises and that why I was so mad when I was finally hungry and upset me to the point of nausea I had weightloss surgery at 16yo so I have to force myself to eat most days or I\u2019ll become severely malnourished", "Except if she took over, then the brownies not being good is as much her fault as yours.

It's like that old saying, \"Good fences make good neighbors\". Good boundaries are crucial, and you did the right thing by letting your sisters know where yours are. It sounds like your sisters didn't like it too much, but you're an adult with your own home and your own life and you get to draw the lines.\n\nSecond, trust your gut. If you feel like people are laughing at you then they probably are. I'm not saying your sisters were intentionally being mean, but if it wasn't funny to you then it wasn't funny. Don't be afraid to call people out when you think they're laughing at you. Don't be mean about it, if it was me I'd say something like \"I'm sorry, I don't understand why that was funny.\" If they can explain the joke, and you can see the humor once they do, laugh. If they explain it, and you don't think it's funny, say so. If they can't explain the joke, they then get to realize that they're a dick.\n\nHope this helps!", "NTA text your sisters that before they come over they need to text or call you to see if it is OK.

They are bullies who abuse you.\n\nI hope that you'll tell them they are no longer allowed to come to your home for the time being. AND STICK TO IT. If they come over, shut the door on them and don't allow them to come in. (Or better yet, just don't even open the door for them.)\n\nPlease, please find a counselor who can help you to understand what's going on with your sisters and learn how to deal with it: how to shut down their bullying, how to set boundaries with them and firmly keep those boundaries.\n\nYou deserve much better than allowing other people to treat you this way.", "Hi! Spouse of someone with celiac here. Check out the gluten free subreddits. Also, if in the US, check out Steve's GF bread flour. Also, hope this isn't against the rules, but you can PM me for GF cooking tips if you want.", "jsyk, that's veeeery common with GF brownies. they're one of the harder treats to get right, especially if it's not from a mix. you can't just sub GF flour into a regular recipe, either. the middle will be gooey, but if you try to keep baking it until it *seems* right, they'll overcook too. so when you pull them out, it needs to look a bit undercooked and it'll be normal once cool but it takes awhile to recognise how it should be. most people helped you with the rest of the post and gave good advice, so I'll chime in on the brownies haha", "Not sure if you'll see this but I'm autistic too, and did want to offer a POV fwiw.\n\nThere seem to be a lot of people on this thread who are seeing this in quite a black & white way, and I get it, but in this situation if does sound as if your sisters love you and are supportive. Taking time out of their evenings, which they could've spent on themselves (or with other people) strikes me as pretty supportive. Particularly as your eldest sister has a kid \u2014 it's not easy for her to take time.out for you.\n\nSo if we assume good faith of all involved \u2014 which I think is a reasonable assumption \u2014 sometimes neurotypical people don't understand when autistic people set boundaries. And the same is true in reverse too. NTs and autistic people communicate in different ways, and so you may express yourself clearly but they don't pick up on it, and they might express themselves clearly but you don't pick up on it.\n\nIt doesn't sound like this is the only thing going on here, but I thought it was worth mentioning. I'm gonna go with NAH.", "NTA OP\n\nIt's only \"funny\" when everyone finds it funny. Otherwise, it's just offensive and rude. Not to mention that they didn't care at all that you just wanted to be left alone.....they'd rather invade YOUR space and trample all over your thoughts, wishes, and feelings, then blame you for it. Sorry OP but if they were actually your friends they WOULD care about these things.", "Sometimes people will light heartedly joke with each other and it's not over anything specific. For example, if someone looks a bit funny when they walk. Or if you did something that looked amusing to them, or made some sort of quirky expression, as you were checking on the stuff in the oven.\n\nIt makes sense that it'd annoy you, particularly if you didn't know what they were laughing at. It's just a question of could they have known that? If we do assume the best in them and need a specific reason to conclude more negative intentions (kind of like an \"innocent until proven guilty\" concept), then I guess I'd personally assume that they didn't realise they were annoying you, unless/until you did something specific to communicate that?", "If you're interested in gluten free suggestions, check out Gluten Free on a Shoestring's recipes and Chocolate Covered Katie's black bean brownies recipe.", "NTA- I felt overwhelmed with the sensory stuff just reading this.

I don\u2019t really do anything back, I kind of just ignore it because at the same time, they are also like parents to me and I am very close to them even if they are mean to me. \n\nI think you\u2019re right on the miscommunication because I always try to tell them when I need space but they don\u2019t listen and I think now they don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s either that or they just don\u2019t respect me enough to try to understand (since they both work with autistic people a lot and have a good understanding of how we function) but I\u2019d rather believe the former haha", "And I bet he will be just as happy with low-key quietness! My ex was a PITA and didn\u2019t get when I needed low stimulation environment. Neurotypicals are such hard work and needy!", "Well, I guess the point here is that they made you uncomfortable, and often do. You should not be feeling that they are always laughing at you and mocking you. Are they being abilist and mocking your autism, or is your autism making it difficult for you to understand a social cue that is funny to others, or is it somewhere in the middle? \n\nWhatever it is, if you want to have a relationship with your sisters that doesn't feel uncomfortable for you, you do need to communicate your feelings to them. Tell them that you don't understand why they are laughing sometimes, and it makes you feel that they are laughing at you. That if you question it or aren't laughing with them, then they may need to explain why they are laughing so that you don't feel uncomfortable. \n\nThey don't seem to understand you, but also, they don't seem to respect you either. I don't necessarily think that means they are ill intentioned. It could just be a symptom of them still seeing you as their little sister, instead of an adult. But it may also be that they think of you as less capable due to your autism. If that is the case, it also needs addressing. Make sure they know that when you ask for help or advice, it doesn't mean \"come and babysit me\". \n\nFor what it's worth, I think the brownies probably would have come out better without them there stressing you out.", "I just thought of something. Why they may have been laughing. You said you kept checking on the brownies. Maybe they thought it was cute that you were so worried about your brownies, and especially cute that you wanted to get them so right for your boyfriend. Also, if you were going back to check them A LOT, then maybe that seemed funny to them because they knew that the brownies would not have really changed inbetween those checks.", "The Live G Free brand of brownie mix from ALDI is super easy \ud83d\udc9d", "I did ask them to stop laughing a couple times but laughing isn\u2019t something we can control so idk", "Thank you!!\n\nI think you\u2019re right on the lack of understanding/respect. They both work with autistic people a lot (one even got a first class degree in psychology), so I think they should have a basic understanding of my struggles. At the same time, autism is extremely different for everybody - even I don\u2019t fully know all of my challenges but I learn more as the days go on. I think not understanding what it\u2019s like for me is fine, but not trying to is disrespectful. My bf tries, he\u2019s also autistic, and he doesn\u2019t mind making adjustments for me when I\u2019m stressed even if that changes his plans. \n\nI also think they don\u2019t respect me a lot (or like you said see me as just the little sister) because of some other things they do, like 24F has owed me \u00a3250 for a year now and is paying me back in instalments because she thinks I will waste the money even though I need it to get things for going back to uni. She also told me once that she just views me as a side character in her life(?) \n33F is a bit nicer than 24F, but sometimes tells me off like I\u2019m one of her 7 year old students. I keep having to remind them that I\u2019m 21 next month and in 9 months I\u2019ll have a degree (from a Russel group university - I just like to add that to annoy them because I\u2019m the smart one in our family lol) and I\u2019ll be moving half way across the country to live with my bf. Idk, I don\u2019t think they notice how old I am, and I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a me thing or a them thing because I like video games and stuff which they probably associate with being young", "Thank you!!
