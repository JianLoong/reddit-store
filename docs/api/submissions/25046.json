{"id": 25046, "submission_id": "15vqq9y", "title": "AITA for telling my sisters to go the fuck home?", "selftext": "As the title says, I (20F) told my sisters, (24F and 33F) to go the fuck home. I feel like it was warranted. I\u2019ve been having a rough week, I just started a new job and found out there had been some drama over people talking about my autism behind my back and all I wanted was a day to myself to just relax before a busy week next week. I thought I\u2019d bake my boyfriend some brownies for our anniversary so I text my 24F sister asking for advice as she and my bf both have a gluten intolerance and I\u2019ve never baked anything gluten free before. \n\nI started baking and I suddenly hear them incessantly knocking at the door, so I unlock it and tell them to just knock once next time because it\u2019s annoying for them to do that when they can see me in the window. As I\u2019m baking, they go into the living room, turn off my music and put YouTube videos on for my five-year-old niece, which was a little annoying but I didn\u2019t mind as she is only a kid. They then started taking the piss out of me for making my boyfriend brownies then 24F took over the entire baking process because apparently I wasn\u2019t doing it right. 33F kept eating the cooking chocolate which I asked her not to do as well.\n\nWhen they were in the oven, my sisters kept asking me about my job and every time I\u2019d answer they\u2019d laugh at me (not sure why). When I got them out of the oven, they needed to go back in. I had to check them about four times, but every time I did my sisters both had to make some comments about it and I couldn\u2019t tell whether they were making fun of me or not. Eventually it got to the point where I was sick of them laughing so I told them to go home and they both got mad at me. My niece started crying and I told her it wasn\u2019t her fault, but 33F told me they were just trying to have a laugh with me so it\u2019s not their fault either. \n\nPersonally I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anybody\u2019s fault, I think I\u2019m just a bit overwhelmed by everything right now but I don\u2019t think my sisters respect my boundaries at all. I had already told them multiple times today that I didn\u2019t want to do anything because they asked me if I wanted to go to the park, but like I\u2019ve said, I didn\u2019t want to, I was tired. I just feel bad because I put it so bluntly and I think it upset my sisters because 33F got defensive saying they weren\u2019t laughing at me, they were laughing \u201cwith\u201d me and 24F said \u201cas always it was nice to see you\u201d kind of sardonically. Plus my niece cried.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1692476984, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vqq9y/aita_for_telling_my_sisters_to_go_the_fuck_home/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were right to send them packing.", "NTA. These people aren't necessarily AHs, but they need to understand what you're going through right now. By what you're saying, it doesn't sound like they gave particularly good 'advice' either. They need to understand that people have different boundaries and not everyone finds what they did funny. Hope the brownies turned out well!", "NTA.\n\nIt's not fault per se? But they were pretty AH-ish towards you. Were they high or something? They sound high and self absorbed. Have they don't this before? But yeah, NTA. That's just some weird way of \"having a laugh with you\". Like... uhm...?", "NTA - They were making fun of you, they were acting like they can just come into your home and take over when they feel like you're \"doing it wrong\" instead of doing what you asked, and once they finally got told off, suddenly it's you who's the problem? No, they're acting entitled to your time, and your energy, and rudely acting up. Good on you for telling them off.", "Nta you never even asked them to come over you asked for advice and they disrespected you to your face in your own home your sisters are bullies use google next time since they obviously don\u2019t know how to advise without judgment", "Were you laughing when they were laughing with you? No. They sound very childish, annoying & give off mean girl vibes. \n\nKeep practicing on your brownies & your cooking, you\u2019ll get there.", "NTA. \n\nHowever, it feels like you should have communicated at the door that now wasn\u2019t a good time. Family can be pushy and overwhelming especially when you\u2019re not comfortable and they are. \n\nThe entire episode seems like a miscommunication.", "You most certainly are NTA.  At some point bullies need to be confronted and barred from bothering you again.  Bravo for you!", "NTA. Your home is your safe space. Your house your rules. Maybe get a doorbell camera setup so that you can see who is outside before opening the door. You never have to let someone who is going to make things harder on you in. Doubly so if they weren\u2019t invited, don\u2019t live there and gave no prior warning.\n\nHopefully the niece crying didn\u2019t cause any sensory issues. ADHD is not autism but sometimes loud noises are just too much, and your home is where you know what sensory triggers there are for sure. You let your guard down more at home, i think everyone with the luxury of having their won space does.\n\nI\u2019m going to be honest, I would have tossed them out the second they crossed an established boundary. It\u2019s not OK, they don\u2019t get a pass because they are family. It\u2019s also a horrible example for niece, she has seen you be insulted even as a joke. Small kids can\u2019t really tell yet, and this could shape her thinking for years about you.", "NTA. At best, your sisters weren\u2019t paying attention to your clear cues that you weren\u2019t enjoying or wanting this interaction. At worst, they were being deliberately unkind. They certainly sound like they took over something you wanted to do yourself, not to mention invading your house, turning your music off without asking, eating things you asked them not to\u2026..Your sisters did not show respect for you in this, and you were absolutely in the right to ask them to go home. Keep communicating boundaries to them as firmly as possible (I know it\u2019s hard - I have one of my own who still sometimes makes me feel bad when I hold firm to a boundary they don\u2019t agree with).", "[deleted]", "They wanted laugh time with you? That means they came to laugh at you. What horrible people. NTA", "This is tough. Your post says you don't really know why they were laughing and a lot of people here are saying they were laughing at you. But honestly,  there  just isn't enough context and I recognise in you a difficulty to infer from context and pick up on what people are trying to do. I have this difficulty sometimes too but to a lesser extent and I'm nearly 40 so I have learnt how my brain works a little. \n\nIf we can look from the outside and instead of assuming the worst of your sisters, let's try to assume the best. People on here have already assumed the worst, so it may help to look at it from another angle. \n\nPerhaps they came over to help you. They knew you had never baked gluten free before. You are their little sister and they want to look out for you. They want to be there with you after a difficult week. We don't know exactly why they were laughing but we can infer that they didn't know just how stressed you were, and just how much they were triggering you. \n\nIt can be hard to understand but people often laugh at others mistakes in a non-malicious way. It's a way of relieving the embarrassment from a situation and allowing that person to laugh at themselves. My husband and I still laugh about the time before we were dating where I took a plastic cup of nuts wrapped in cling film travelling with me to Europe. I thought it was a good solution to having no Tupperware. He thought I was crazy and joked about it. We both laughed as I realised that it actually isn't normal behaviour and he meant no harm in laughing about it. He usually knows what I can be sensitive about and doesn't laugh at me for those things. And i am a overly-sensitive person. \n\nAll this to say, that people that love us sometimes don't realise they are crossing a line because they are comfortable with us. \n\nYou are perfectly within your right to say to them that no, you don't want their help and need space from everyone to decompress. They should respect that, and if they don't the  they are the AHs. But, you need to clearly express your needs to them. You need to let them know you are triggered when they bang on the door and switch off your music. That you don't want to snap at them, but are very overwhelmed right now and need space. \n\nIt's hard to judge this. Of cpurse your sisters really could have come round just to put you down. If they have a history of bullying you to make themselves feel better, then maybe that is the case. But something about your middle sister's bitter exit (uncalled for from her btw) tells me that they are trying to connect with you somehow. Perhaps they don't understand your autism as well as they should. \n\nI would explain to them your situation (work, wanting to have time to yourself and be independent). I would also explain that you truely did not understand what they were laughing at, and ask them to explain. Make a plan going forward to be firm with boundaries with them and ask them to be understanding. \n\nNTA or NAH", "NTA. You mention you have autism. you sound like you were already stretched thin emotionally from work and then people turn up unexpectedly, upending your plans, and keep talking to you rather than letting you just exist to process your day and recharge. \n\nIf your sisters are close they should accept your boundaries and that includes alone time to recharge. Now, if they are NTs they may have thought if it was a stressful week they wanted to help you relax and forget it, not realising that is unlikely to help somebody with ASD who might need that alone time.\n\nI think I'd have snapped.", "You\u2019re always allowed to set boundaries in your life.", "NTA. They showed up unannounced, for one, and if your autism is like mine, that would fuck my mood up right then and there.", "NTA\n\nThey were laughing at you not with you, since you weren't laughing ....", "No, what they were doing was belittling you and being abusive by bullying you in your own home.\n\nNTA, and don't invite them back", "[deleted]", "NTA", "NTA - your sisters were intentionally annoying you, for their own amusement.", "NTA! They don\u2019t respect you at all, anyone who says we\u2019re laughing with you not at you are liars. They sound awful to deal with", "NTA you are allowed to have boundaries", "NTA don't let them in next time", "NTA\n\nThey sound rude and inconsiderate.\n\nSome people just have a bubble of noise, confusion, and nonsense that follows them wherever they go.", "NTA. Not even a little bit. To review, they:  \n\n\n1. Barged into your home uninvited\n2. Tried to take over something you were making for your boyfriend\n3. Made fun of you for cooking for your boyfriend.\n4. Make fun of you for talking about your job.\n5. Gaslight you when you're finally sick of it and claim they're trying to laugh \\*with\\* you, but since you weren't laughing, it proves them false.\n6. Get huffy when you show them to the door.\n7. Make you feel bad for their behavior.\n\nNext time they come knocking uninvited, tell them you're busy and to go away. Your sisters are bullies and are not entitled to overstep your boundaries.", "I don't think there are any assholes here. It's obvious your sisters like spending time with you - but it's also understandable that you weren't in the right frame of mind for sisterly hijinks. From what I've read, it seems like you have a loving relationship with them, and this will resolve itself.", "A friend of mine uses this response:\n\nMeanie: \"We're not laughing \\*at\\* you; we're laughing \\*with\\* you.\"\n\nFriend: \"I'm not laughing.\"", "I just feel bad because we\u2019re very close as sisters and I upset them", "Thank you, they are terrible haha, the middle is all gooey, it\u2019s like cookie dough. My boyfriend said he\u2019s gonna try and improve them with me because this is the first time I\u2019ve baked gluten free treats", "Sometimes they can be a bit mean, like they will make jokes at my expense a lot, but they\u2019re usually nice I think", "Oh I would use google, I just hate having to scroll through an entire novel to get to the recipe - why do recipe bloggers feel the need to put their memoirs before the actual content is beyond me", "Thank you!! I think my cooking is okay, I love to cook - I have been since I was 11 hehe, but baking is just a mystery. \n\nI did say they were being mean girls, and to be honest, I said it as a joke but neither of them were laughing so I think I messed up the tone or they were just already mad at me. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just glad it\u2019s now peaceful", "Thank you, I will take that as advice for next time (I didn\u2019t know you didn\u2019t have to let people in your home if they\u2019re at your door)", "I never even considered the effect it could have on my niece but tbh 33F (her mum) is already teaching her to breach my personal boundaries. I don\u2019t like physical touch that much, so instead of hugs, I told my niece to give me high fives and told her a little bit about autism and why she should high five me, and she doesn\u2019t mind it. Her mum keeps egging her on to hug me though and kept doing it before and I just think it\u2019s not a good example to set for someone her age, especially when that\u2019s coupled with them making fun of me", "Thank you, I\u2019m gonna work on building boundaries more to be honest because I think this (and the comments I\u2019ve received here) have shown me I struggle to set them and should be more firm", "I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand", "What do you mean? I don\u2019t really understand", "Thank you for this. To be honest, I think a lot of the comments are a bit overly negative, but at the same time I don\u2019t really know why they were making fun of me for loving my boyfriend and making him brownies. 24F has recently broken up with her boyfriend so maybe that\u2019s why she felt the need to take over(?) and the 33F is an extrovert (I\u2019m a huge introvert) so I don\u2019t think she realises sometimes when she\u2019s overstepping social boundaries. I don\u2019t really understand the laughing because tbh I didn\u2019t make a terrible mistake, I was mostly just checking if they were done, but they found that really funny and it was annoying me. Now that I\u2019ve had time to think about it and stuff I don\u2019t think they came over to make fun of me, I think they were a bit hyper and wanted to see me but I wasn\u2019t feeling it and then they made fun of me (which isn\u2019t a one off thing)", "They are NTs but one studied psychology at uni, got a first and now works with autistic people 5 days a week, whereas the other works in a school and often has autistic kids in her class. I have suspected for a while that neither of them really care about how I experience autism, they just like to use it as a token", "Oh it kind of did fuck my mood up. I had been playing minecraft all day (current hyperfixation as my bf and I just started a server and since he hasn\u2019t played in about 8 years, I\u2019ve been trying to set it up so we can explore the new stuff), and I was feeling pretty happy. Then I wanted to bake, like I said but them showing up was just a big distraction that threw my night off", "I don\u2019t think I was clear!! I didn\u2019t invite them over, they just showed up while I was in the middle of baking - I texted for advice on what gluten free substitute would be good", "She got mad that they were not listening to her and that they were constantly laughing at everything she did or said you sound like just as much of a bully as the sisters she asked for advice not for three uninvited house guests", "Your comprehension skills suck. She didn\u2019t invite them over. She called one sister to ask for advice, they took over and invited themselves and started being mean to OP.", "They were NOT invited. \n\nShe asked one of the sisters for advice so she didn't accidentally make her partner ill and they showed up,  cop-knocking and invited themselves in.", "And what about you being upset? That somehow doesn't count...?", "No; you are not very close with them.  They are close with each other and let you in from time to time.  :(", "Nope, their behavior here is pretty clearly terrible. You texted asking for *advice*, not *help*, then BOTH of them come WITH A YOUNG CHILD and then 24f takes over the baking? It's like they think you're completely useless. It's wildly inappropriate.", "While siblings can be mean to each other on occasions, as per my fianc\u00e9e has told me (I'm an only child), this right here isn't sibling meanness. It sounds like they were high, I swear. I've had friends arrive home acting like this, high on sugar, caffeine, or weed or drunk. And I've had to do the same thing, shove them out the door with a \"sober up and call me when you get home!\".  \nBut if they weren't, they were just being plain horrible and you did the right thing.", "I don\u2019t get it either and it\u2019s frustrating I can\u2019t eat sugar so finding recipes is difficult for me but my siblings are the same way they will make snide comments about me not only when we are alone but even in public or when family is visiting just last week my brother had a problem with me eating a hotdog at a family barbecue so I just threw my whole plate away and went to my grandma\u2019s room ( it was her house) and stayed there until my carpool wanted to leave but if I hadn\u2019t done that he would have tried to actually fight me and there were children around he out weighs me by almost 100 pounds and I\u2019m female so he has a clear advantage but somehow I\u2019m found as the aggressor so it would\u2019ve been a lose lose situation hope you have better luck with your siblings", "They kinda took over your house, tv & kitchen. Then they get upset with you bc you seemed to be overwhelmed? It sound like They definitely were not respecting you or your boundaries. \n\nBaking takes practice & you\u2019ll have plenty of burnt stuff. May I suggest getting some chicken, bc they will eat anything, lol.\n\nI\u2019ve been cooking since 8 & probably baking since 11. I\u2019m 55 now. I still occasionally burn when baking. My husband says it\u2019s just burnt on the bottom. \n\nCookbooks, YouTube & google tutorials will help a lot too.", "Can I ask what your heritage is? In some cultures it\u2019s taught differently about letting people in.", "Sorry I have neuropathy and flipped on wrong post", "Yeah. There are very few people even amongst those I love and care about that can get away with an unannounced visit. Plus, they brought your niece. I love my little cousins (10 & 12) but damn, kids are loud and I get the sensory overload if I can\u2019t prepare for it.", "You were clear, this guy just doesn't have good reading comprehension.\n\nOP I want you to consider that maybe your sisters are bullying you a little bit. This sounds like a pattern. You are NTA for standing up for yourself.", "You were actually perfectly clear - it was easy to understand they came over uninvited. But some redditors don't read well. You are fine.", "I don\u2019t think your sisters came over with baked goods with the intention to mock you and break your boundaries. They were likely upset because it sounds like you were overwhelmed and were not good company. Sure, they may have been assholes for making fun of you, but you need to primarily consider their intentions and their reasons for coming over to see you.", "I mean you have a point, I just don\u2019t really think about my emotions because if I voice them I get told I\u2019m being dramatic", "Tbh, I am kind of useless at baking lol, the brownies are liquid in the middle. I told my bf and he said he\u2019ll try them and teach me how to make them better at least", "I don\u2019t think they were high haha, us three don\u2019t really take substances because our parents are alcoholics", "Oh god that\u2019s awful! I hope you\u2019re okay!!\n\nAnd for me it\u2019s kind of like off handed things. It does mess me up mentally, like my 24F kept telling me I shouldn\u2019t be losing weight. I struggle to eat large portions of food because I\u2019m on antidepressants and birth control which can both suppress your appetite, and she once sat down and practically force fed me my dinner by saying if I don\u2019t finish the plate, she\u2019s putting me in the car and taking me to get diagnosed with an ED", "Thank you!! I use the bosh cook books (I\u2019m vegetarian trying to transition to vegan in the next two years) but it\u2019s having to do coeliac friendly recipes for my boyfriend which can be hard. We always revert to rice haha\n\nAnd yeah putting it into the perspective that they took over things makes a lot of sense. 24F even took the mixer and spatula because she felt like baking after taking over my recipe :/", "Oh yeah, I\u2019m white and British - specifically from the north west so it\u2019s kind of friendly around here (depending on who you ask).", "It\u2019s okay!! Hope you find the post you were looking for :))", "Yup, my niece is especially loud, it\u2019s like she\u2019s a foghorn with legs. I love her, but she is too much sometimes, and she especially was today. For example, she kept asking to listen to really annoying songs then she would crawl around me whilst I\u2019m baking (specifically when I was melting chocolate with a pan full of boiling water in hand) and then she kept making me go watch her do cartwheels. She also kept screaming because nobody would dance with her", "I mean, they make fun of me a fair bit, and don\u2019t do it to each other. I assume it\u2019s because I\u2019m the weird one in our family, but idk. It doesn\u2019t matter too much moving forward because after university I\u2019ll be moving across the country and I doubt my family are gonna want to visit me. I don\u2019t think I matter that much in our familial infrastructure tbqh", "It is a good point to consider their intentions, but I told them a few times today that I didn\u2019t want to do anything because I\u2019m tired after an 11 hour shift yesterday. They came over unannounced while I was baking because they thought I\u2019d be lonely (because my parents went on a last minute drinking binge somewhere and left me home alone for the weekend) but I wasn\u2019t, I had plans to do laundry, wash my hair and play minecraft with my bf after I was finished", "That's not okay at all!! Your feelings are valid. You might wanna reconsider what you told me about being put down by them and you three being close.", "Legit sounds like what happens with my gf and her sister and mom. She feels guilty for hurting their feelings after standing up for herself and boundaries and disregards how it was justified by their actions. It isn\u2019t easy to do and does take an emotional toll but it needs to happen sometimes.", "Op they are gaslighting the shit out of you. Your sisters are sucky people. When someone makes you feel bad you should let them know that their behavior is making you uncomfortable and if they continue to mess with you quit interacting with them or get pissed", "You're nor \"useless\" baking, you just need practice, nobody's born knowing. It sounds like you've been put down by those two quite a bit. I hope I'm wrong, tho.", "Well good. It just such weird behaviour from adults. x'D You're still NTA, tho.", "Happy baking & cooking!", "Gotcha that makes sense. Was just wondering due to Latin heritage being it\u2019s unheard of not to let someone in the house if they\u2019re at the door lol", "You're going to make a great and happy life for yourself, I know it. Leave those losers in the dust.", "Maybe you\u2019re right a little, but we still are close. One took me in last year when my parents were abusing me and the police had to remove me from the house, and the other one used to save me from my parents beatings. We do have a good sibling bond, it\u2019s just sometimes they are mean to me", "You\u2019re right! I think it\u2019s important for me as well because I have autism and some simple boundaries like \u201cdon\u2019t touch my stuff\u201d get broken, and it can cause me to have a meltdown. From this point on I\u2019m gonna try and be more firm, it\u2019s my mid-year resolution haha", "You\u2019re right! I think it\u2019s important for me as well because I have autism and some simple boundaries like \u201cdon\u2019t touch my stuff\u201d get broken, and it can cause me to have a meltdown. From this point on I\u2019m gonna try and be more firm, it\u2019s my mid-year resolution haha", "Nah definitely not put down by them - this is my first time making any gluten free bake. I\u2019m good at cooking, just not baking. 24F is good at baking which is probably why she took over what I was doing, but she did it in school too", "Oh we\u2019re a weird family haha", "I didn\u2019t know that was specifically a Latin thing! But yeah I just didn\u2019t know, either because of how I was raised or just what it\u2019s like around me (people inviting you in for a cuppa and some digestives as you talk over Tipping Point - british \u201cculture\u201d is rather odd)", "Ah that\u2019s been my thoughts for a while now. As much as I love my sisters, I think having the distance would be better off for me because I feel so much more like myself when I\u2019m around my boyfriend and in a different city", "Okay, I suggest you all go to therapy. By the sounds of this you have a ton of things to work through. Good luck", "It\u2019s not easy, and my gf herself has an anxiety disorder. I\u2019d talk to a therapist about how to go about it in the best way for you however. It\u2019s good to have them as a sounding board. Or your boyfriend for that matter who sounds like a wonderful guy.", "So? They're being Ash's about it.... I think you need to view this from another perspective.", "I think the person is referring to how you take casual digs at yourself in your replies like someone with low self esteem.", "I think it varies on region in the UK from my understanding but I\u2019m an American so I have no true way of knowing", "Oh thank you!! I\u2019ve tried three types of therapy so far and I\u2019m doing quite well - my favourite is art therapy and my partner is so supportive with it all - he even has a canvas of one of my paintings :))", "Yeah I think my boyfriend will help for now. I have a therapist in my university so I don\u2019t really have a way of contacting her during summer breaks and stuff. But my bf is usually quite understanding about this sort of stuff, he knows I\u2019m close with my sisters but he also knows how much they can overstep", "Oh no it definitely does!! I think it\u2019s kind of based on our regions and our economic divides, for example somewhere like Devon will have a middle-to-upper class population and is more likely to have stereotypical brits because of its aging population, whereas Yorkshire has a very homely atmosphere. To me, I\u2019d see it as comparing a scone to a steak and ale pie - if that makes any sense", "Art therapy is amazing. I'm an illustrator and vent art has saved me countless times.", "That\u2019s great! Well I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve got him in your life! Yeah that\u2019s the one downside of the university therapist. But during the summer I think your boyfriend will manage as your support in this instance until summer is over.", "Right? It\u2019s so relaxing.
