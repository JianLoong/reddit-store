It's extremely common in India since both Hindu and Muslim communities follow this practice (with different traditions albeit).\n\nMy Husband is from the US, we've been married 4 years. We're in India rn visiting my family. 2 days ago, we were on facetime with his parents and mentioned while we're here we will have a ceremony, 'Mundan' for our daughter (3F) while we're here. They were excited and MIL even asked me to send photos. Everything was ok until my husband joked \"You'll finally know what Maya looks like as a baby!\" (Maya was born with a full head of hair). MIL was confused but when she learned about the shaving, she was furious.\n\nThis was not even for religion since she knows my daughter is being raised Hindu (Husband's family are devout Christians, My husband left the religion years ago). She has never expressed anger towards this in particular, so it was not the reason for her outburst.\n\nShe went on a tirade how I was trying to 'un-black' my daughter. (My husband's black) and how I don't like my daughter's hair. She said I don't love her natural hair and have consistently tried to make it like mine, which is frankly not true. She also mentioned I'll start bleaching her skin soon since it's common with 'my people'. This is completely baseless. Not only are we darker than her entire family, but also this was completely out of the blue.\n\nI've done my best in my search for my daughter's hair care. I've visited many black owned salons with my SILs and found the perfect one for my daughter. My husband researched about hair care products for babies and Maya's hair is very healthy and I've heard no complaints from anyone. I even have a hair oiling tradition with her. My mother and grandmother followed this and it was a great bonding time for us, I wanted to share this with my daughter too. I can't even say anything for the skin bleaching stuff.\n\nThe only conversation MIL and I had before about Maya's hair was when she mentioned she wanted to get cornrows done and asked if Maya would go to get hers done too. She was 2 at the time so I said no.\n\nI completely blew up at her after this. My Husband was mad at his mom, but said we should just have the ceremony on the down low (with my immediate family and not post anything about the ceremony) since her hair would grow when we go back, but I want her to have a big ceremony and she's quite excited about it too.\n\nI'm also pretty hurt about MIL's outburst as I've had a good relationship w her. FIL has been quiet since this happened and SILs are 19 so they can't say much. My family was in the next room while this happened and they heard MIL (she was THAT loud) and are mad at my husband.

She said some pretty hurtful shit, but I think it does reveal an anxiety that her grandchild might be raised in a culture that is foreign to her, and that probably scares her. \n\nOf course, for you and your culture, this ceremony is incredibly important. For you it's full of love and tradition and symbolism and you want to share that with your daughter. How could you not?

I find it wild that this is just taken as part and parcel of the process.", ">And it seems like black cultural erasure, which is a systemic problem.\n\nSo because it looks that way to you (even though it's not. Her hair will grow back the same), you're ok with Hindu cultural erasure?", "what is wrong with you?? You seriously need help like the daughter being half black has nothing to do with the mundan\ud83d\udc80", "> And it seems like black cultural erasure, which is a systemic problem.\n\n\n> Which sure comes off, in this case, as creepily erasive of the daughter's half-black heritage.\n\nLet us accuse a country where black people and racism didn\u2019t exist of racism. No Indian checks their baby\u2019s skin tone before cutting the hair off.\n\nYou\u2019ve crossed the boundary and now *YOU* are the one misrepresenting Indian culture and showing your ignorance. These traditions weren\u2019t created with race in mind. This is exactly how Western ignorance proves harmful to our culture with them trying to fit it into their own confines and misrepresenting it. There\u2019s some hypocrisy you show there, promoting Indian culture erasure and demonising it with something completely unrelated to it."]}
