{"id": 7630, "submission_id": "10f1isv", "title": "AITA for planning to shave my daughter's hair?", "selftext": "The title sounds really iffy, so to preface, my husband (M32) is ok with it.\n\nI (F33) am Hindu, and it is a custom in my religion for babies to go through a right of passage by shaving their head when they're typically 1-3 years old. It's extremely common in India since both Hindu and Muslim communities follow this practice (with different traditions albeit).\n\nMy Husband is from the US, we've been married 4 years. We're in India rn visiting my family. 2 days ago, we were on facetime with his parents and mentioned while we're here we will have a ceremony, 'Mundan' for our daughter (3F) while we're here. They were excited and MIL even asked me to send photos. Everything was ok until my husband joked \"You'll finally know what Maya looks like as a baby!\" (Maya was born with a full head of hair). MIL was confused but when she learned about the shaving, she was furious.\n\nThis was not even for religion since she knows my daughter is being raised Hindu (Husband's family are devout Christians, My husband left the religion years ago). She has never expressed anger towards this in particular, so it was not the reason for her outburst.\n\nShe went on a tirade how I was trying to 'un-black' my daughter. (My husband's black) and how I don't like my daughter's hair. She said I don't love her natural hair and have consistently tried to make it like mine, which is frankly not true. She also mentioned I'll start bleaching her skin soon since it's common with 'my people'. This is completely baseless. Not only are we darker than her entire family, but also this was completely out of the blue.\n\nI've done my best in my search for my daughter's hair care. I've visited many black owned salons with my SILs and found the perfect one for my daughter. My husband researched about hair care products for babies and Maya's hair is very healthy and I've heard no complaints from anyone. I even have a hair oiling tradition with her. My mother and grandmother followed this and it was a great bonding time for us, I wanted to share this with my daughter too. I can't even say anything for the skin bleaching stuff.\n\nThe only conversation MIL and I had before about Maya's hair was when she mentioned she wanted to get cornrows done and asked if Maya would go to get hers done too. She was 2 at the time so I said no.\n\nI completely blew up at her after this. My Husband was mad at his mom, but said we should just have the ceremony on the down low (with my immediate family and not post anything about the ceremony) since her hair would grow when we go back, but I want her to have a big ceremony and she's quite excited about it too.\n\nI'm also pretty hurt about MIL's outburst as I've had a good relationship w her. FIL has been quiet since this happened and SILs are 19 so they can't say much. My family was in the next room while this happened and they heard MIL (she was THAT loud) and are mad at my husband. Idk, this was supposed to be a fun trip back home and it just spiraled into this.", "created_utc": 1674027704, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10f1isv/aita_for_planning_to_shave_my_daughters_hair/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(My husband's black) and how I don't like my daughter's hair.\n\nMIL also should recognise that your daughter is also half Indian (correct me if I'm wrong) and therefore...she should be able to celebrate both sides of her heritage. It isn't about stripping her of part of her identity - it's about teaching her  everything that makes her who she is.", "MiL was completely out of line. Cultural respect is a two way street. That said, this is a discussion with your husband about placating his mother. It needs to stop. \n\nThen, your husband tells his mother she will respect the parental decisions you & he make, or else her role in the kid's life will be limited going forward.\n\nYou need to have a discussion with your parents that they will not blame your husband for his mother's poor manners.\n\nThen, celebrate your baby's Mundan.", "NTA\n\nLets put the racism aside for a minute. It seems very popular for grandmothers to object to what the mother wants. For example, I am from a white culture and my mother screamed the house down, when my sister, wanted to ear pierce, her daughters ears.\n\nI can only think the secretly fantasize the child is theirs, and when you go alter the baby, it's kinda bursting their fantasy bubble.  \n\n\nNow the racism, Your mother in law appears to have been hiding that one for some time. Im guessing she has been hiding it for so long, it's been building and building. She's clearly erupted like a volcano, full of her hate speech.\n\nGet your child's hair cut, you are following your culture. Remind your MIL how it is only hair and will soon grow back.", "NTA. \n\nIf it's a common tradition that does not harm to the baby, and you'd do it no matter who you married, then your MIL is just plain wrong.  I wouldn't be surprised if she's projecting some discrimination that she's experienced onto you.  Your husband should probably try and explain the ceremony, and the significance of it, to her.", "NTA. If you and your husband want to do this then I don't see the harm. Its not MILs place to say what you can/cant/should/shouldn't do. It's hair, it will grow back. It's not a practice/custom that will hurt her.", "NTA. Sounds like she\u2019s just afraid of your baby not experiencing both cultures, even though you\u2019ve proven you\u2019ve done everything you can to ensure she does. Her reacting that way and accusing you of wanting to bleach your baby\u2019s skin on the phone with everyone is not ok though. \n  \nYou deserve to share your culture with your baby too. I hope when MIL cools off she understands that and apologizes, or at least wants to talk things through. Sorry you\u2019re going through this but go ahead and do the big ceremony because at the end of the day your baby\u2019s happiness comes first. You\u2019ve got this mama bear!", "NTA. It's YOUR child. Not your in laws. Not your parents. You and your husband make these decisions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is also stupid. A toddler won't know her hair is gone.

Not due to religion but my parents shaved my hair when I was around that age too. What do I care, I dont even remember it. I'm asian tho so I dont have the same hair youre talking about and i dont know how to care for it\n\nUnless shaving your daughter's hair would somehow ruin it i dont see how youre being an AH.

She really needs to back off and keep out of your business. Do what feels right and try to not care what MIL says.", "Definitely NTA, your MIL the AH though. This is between you and your husband,  not her. It's hair, it grows back and your daughter is also looking forward to the ceremony. You all just celebrate however you want and ignore her if she wants to act like that. You, your husband and daughter enjoy the ceremony and spending time with your family.", "NTA. I think there is a big cultural clash going on here. What no one is saying is that hair can be incredibly important for black women. Caring for hair and doing hair together can be a bonding thing. She is reacting because for her, losing the hair means losing some of that. She reacted emotionally, of course she knows logically the hair will grow back. She said some pretty hurtful shit, but I think it does reveal an anxiety that her grandchild might be raised in a culture that is foreign to her, and that probably scares her. \n\nOf course, for you and your culture, this ceremony is incredibly important. For you it's full of love and tradition and symbolism and you want to share that with your daughter. How could you not? And you and your husband are the parents, so of course you have every right to do so. Your MIL was the AH in this situation, and she was incredibly out of line. I'm not saying you should excuse her, and she definitely owes you an apology, but maybe you guys can talk this out and come to some kind of understanding.", "NTA. This is for you and your husband to decide, and your MIL basically accusing you of racism is out of order.", "NTA. Your child not hers. \n\nI promise you it's not easy though! My baby was born with lovely dark hair, a fair amount, even quite long. At seven days old she had her aqiqah ceremony.\nI didn't realise how much I would mourn her hair!!! I kept every strand \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude06\n\nAt three months old her hair is just at the stage where I can maybe sweep it in a direction but it's lighter coloured.\nI thought it would be back and long by now!!\n\n\nI was born in Mexico and also had my head shaved as a baby! And my eyelashes were cut off. My hair is past my bum n lashes are as long as fake lashes. \n\nI didn't cut my babies eyelashes.", "NTA, your daughter is half black...and also half Indian.

And is constantly pitching fits about their kid's hair and how the 'white woman is ruining it because she be worthless.' She is constantly attempting to barge in and take over and show the white wife 'how it's done.'\n\nThis resulted in my friend picking his mother up, plopping her on her butt on the front stoop, and locking the doors several times. Keep in mine, my friend's wife is half Portuguese, and her temper is... off the charts when it comes to their kids.

I dont get that.", "Ah yes, Hindus definitely created this tradition thousands of years ago to be racist against this half Indian half Black child.  /s\n\nThis happens to almost every Indian child. She isn't singling out her child for being half Black, she's doing this because her child is half Indian. Since the family is in India, the child will be able to see other kiddos doing their mundan as well."]}
