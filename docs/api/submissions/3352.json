My friend and others have been begging me to move out since I was 16. It\u2019s a pretty uncommon thing to do here. I live in the south where the majority of people live with their parents until they get married. I never wanted to do that. In fact, I was planning on gettin an apartment over the summer, but finally caved because my friend was telling me to move in with her in January. \n\nI brought the idea up to my parents in October, and they started picking it apart and asking what I would do with all the extra expenses I would have to pay. \n\nI explained to them that living here was more expensive than living with my friend. \n\nThey called me ungrateful and said that it\u2019s a privilege for me to live with them and to get groceries and my phone bill paid for by them.\n\nI then said that the rent ($700) is me basically paying for all those things myself but regardless I was very grateful for the life they\u2019ve given me. I would not want to get kicked out for wanting to leave. I still want a decent relationship with my parents. I was simply punished for giving an attitude which I didn\u2019t understand but it\u2019s fine. \n\nMy parents have now been making snide remarks about my friend and the place we\u2019re planning on staying at (my friend is great and so is the place).\n\nAlthough I love my parents, I feel like a prisoner here. I have since I was younger, and when I wasn\u2019t paying rent. \n\nWe have this system where one of us (out of four siblings) clean the entire house for a week and then it\u2019s the next siblings week. If we miss something, we get another week, punished, and pay our parents 20 dollars. \n\nI work three jobs and have been cleaning the house for a month now because I miss something every time. I also pay for groceries sometimes when my parents don\u2019t buy things for me (I have a very strict diet due to medical conditions).\n\nI\u2019m just really tired, but I don\u2019t want to hurt my parents\u2019 feelings.  \nI feel like a child asking advice on here, but a friend recommended I do it because I was so conflicted.\n\nEdit 1: I am a boy. I added the m now. I can't blame people for misgendering me I guess since I never mentioned it. I'll be posting another edit soon hopefully. I have a lot of stuff to think over and it feels like my whole life is being questioned and turned upside down.", "created_utc": 1669517695, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5pmwu/aita_for_moving_out_my_parents_home_when_its/", "score": 388, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Rules like \"clean up after yourself\", or \"don't eat in the bedrooms\", or a chore schedule, but what your parents are doing is abusive. \n\nYou say you keep missing things when you clean.

If they act hurt, think about the real reason why. Is it because their independent and very capable child has finally grown up and can fly, or is it because their maid and a major contributor to them financially is gone?

Of course sometimes my parents will ask me to help clean another area of the house and if I have time I will.

All that aside, you are a young adult starting out. It's time to just find your wings and fly. Don't let your parents get to you. They seem to only be thinking of their finances.", "NTA Living with your parents sounds miserable. These people seem pretty committed to being extremely harsh/abusive with their adult children. \n\nI understand you wanting to have a positive relationship with them, but the negativity in the relationship is coming FROM them. You will never, ever be able to get these people to treat you decently by appeasing them or catering to their whims because their treatment of you is being caused by something that\u2019s off about them and has nothing to do with you or your actions. If you leave, your relationship with them may stay the same, get better, get worse, or disappear entirely, but it will never, ever change for the better as long as you live at home.\n\nI suggest avoiding further conversation about the matter and, if necessary, repeating a carefully crafted message like a broken record. Maybe something like this:\n\n\u201cI appreciate the start you\u2019ve given me in life. I\u2019m planning to move out because I\u2019m an adult and I think this move is the best decision for me. I\u2019m grateful to you for your understanding and emotional support.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting this phrasing because I actually think they\u2019re offering you understanding or support. I doubt they even deserve your gratitude, to be frank. I\u2019m suggesting it purely as a way of trying to reduce conflict and unpleasantness as much as possible. Also, sometimes when you give people credit in advance for decent behavior they decide to live up to your stated expectations\u2014although with your parents, I wouldn\u2019t count on that happening.", "Wow that sounds unbearably controlling, poor you. You're an adult now, go live your life. I can almost guarantee that if you don't they will try and have a hold on you forever.

Raising the rent over the last year from 300 to 700 and making it a punishment would seem to me to be parents that wanted their child to move out.\n\n The way they have set up the cleaning schedule is not optimal. It would make more sense, and be teaching more life skills to have each of you do 1/6 of the common areas ( including your parents) and rotate which part so everyone is getting experience at cleaning everything. In your own home, you would not clean the whole house one week and then not do anything for 3 weeks, that's silly. Each person is responsible for their own spaces and laundry.\n\n I didn't grow up in the south but I have friends who did and they were not expected to live at home. Or if they were expected to stay home, they were not expected to pay you rent. I did grow up in a Catholic home. I was welcome to stay past 18 and did not have to pay any rent as long as I was still in school. \n\nOf course there are many different ways a family can function, but your parents seem to me, to be going about this in an abusive and manipulative fashion. When you leave, make sure you have all your important papers: birth certificate, social security card, passport. Contact the 3 credit reporting agencies to lock down your credit. File your taxes early so they can't claim you on their taxes. If you have been paying 700$ month in rent, you are not their dependant. I hope they will still be willing to fill out the parent portion of the FAFSA, if you are currently a student and get financial aid. NTA", "NTA\u2026this was my thing. Paying for any missed chores, no real freedom, and rent on top. When I was informed they were raising the penalties, and it would work out to 700/800 a month, I found a place to rent for half of that. They were upset, but the freedom I found was amazing.\n\nAll that to say, please move out. The first month or two is going to be a mix or guilt and relief at the freedom you now have. But it is worth it. And if they are anything like mine, you and your parent\u2019s relationship may improve once you are on your own.
