{"id": 26569, "submission_id": "16ex1uc", "title": "AITA for evicting my long standing tenants?", "selftext": "I (38F) bought a 4 bedroom house in semi-rural Buckinghamshire when I was 23. It was a lovely big house, but the town was not fun for a 23 year old. I always said I'd love it of I were 40 with kids, but it wasn't a great place for someone in their 20s. When I was 26, I put the house on the rental market and moved to London where I lived for 2 years before moving to Australia. \n\nI found a lovely family to rent the house. A husband and wife both in their mid to late 40s with one child, no pets, and respectable jobs. Rent was always paid on time, the estate agent always had good reports from inspection visits and we never heard ant complaints from neighbours. \n\nFF 14 years later, they're still living there. I've been travelling the world full time for some years, spent the pandemic in Australia then resumed travelling post lock downs. I'm now ready to return home, so I informed my estate agent that I want to break the contract and have them move out in 3 months' time, 2 months more notice than I'm obligated to give. \n\nThe tenants were surprised to hear I was coming back and tried to ask if I was coming to live with my family. The agent brushed off question and told them to vacate in 3 months and that they can help find alternative accommodation. Tenants texted me directly to ask same question and I replied \"haha, no husband or kids in tow - just ready to set roots again! Looking forward to being home\" (I grew up 20 mins aways). I got a text calling me selfish for: kicking them out of their home of nearly 15 years; wanting a big house all to myself; placing my needs of travel and enjoyment ahead of starting a family and getting married. They told me I should leave them to buy the house for what I bought it for (it's doubled in price since) and go live in my other house. I replied \"you can dictate in a house that you own, not one that I own. Please have your things packed by x date or I'll evict you and sue you for the costs\". \n\nMy friends are saying I'm kicking them out of their home and I don't need such a big place so I can rent or sell my student flat for a deposit for a house nearby. My rented house is 90% paid though and I don't want to start again with a new mortgage. I want to live in my house. I have been fair to the tenants and reasonable in my request. AITA?\n\nRecently learnt of the edit feature haha. \n\nOkay, thank you for the feedback. I will be asking the estate agent to ask what ways I can help make this transition easier. I'm willing to extend the notice period by a few months if they want to. Thank you to those who remained civil in their disagreement.

I would've said that (nicely) rather than give them personal info they have zero rights to.\n\nI'm happy they seem to have taken care of your house, and have enjoyed living there for the time they have.  \n\nI'm sure they made a plenitude of lovely memories in your house, but the fact remains it is *your house*, not theirs.  You're following the necessary legalities, in addition to giving them ample, \"bonus time,\" to vacate.\n\n*As heartbreaking as I'm sure this is, if the tenants wanted permanency, they should have purchased their own home*.\n______________________________________\n\nEditing to Add:\n\nMany are being extremely assumptive in comments.  Because I am of the aforementioned opinion, that *must mean* I'm either very affluent, or a landlord myself.  \n*Neither is the case*.\n\nI am a *renter*,  of a very small house.  I make less than 50k/year, and still manage to support a household of 3 (barely, but we manage). I too, am not in a position to buy a home.  I too, would rather not throw money away on rent for the rest of my life.\n\n*Neither* financial, *nor* social standing, dictates one's ability to comprehend *fairness*, or distinguish between right and wrong.\n\nOP has stated in comments, she would've likely had *no qualms* about extending their \"vacate date,\" had they only asked.  Instead, they chose to immediately respond with proverbial viper-fangs, unjustified animosity, unsolicited judgment, a buy-offer at a fraction of the house's worth, and a predisposition to turn their noses up at OP's singleness (citing it as the reason she shouldn't live in her own house). None of this...is remotely appropriate (nor applicable) to the business transaction of renting a house, and it certainly didn't assist in the possibility of an extended vacate term.\n\nLastly, several are taking my, \"should've bought their own house,\" in a literal sense, whereas *most readers*, correctly inferred my intent.  \nThese tenants either couldn't, or didn't want to...buy a home. As such, they inhabited OP's home with *intact knowledge* they could be required to leave during any one of these years. Meaning, they knew permanency was not a given. Said tenants are now chastising and harrassing OP, simply because the inevitable came to fruition.\n\nOP is NTA, and has been *more than gracious* in her actions regarding *her* house.", "NTA\n\nIt's your house to start with.

It was a lovely big house, but the town was not fun for a 23 year old. I always said I'd love it of I were 40 with kids, but it wasn't a great place for someone in their 20s. When I was 26, I put the house on the rental market and moved to London where I lived for 2 years before moving to Australia. \n\nI found a lovely family to rent the house. A husband and wife both in their mid to late 40s with one child, no pets, and respectable jobs. Rent was always paid on time, the estate agent always had good reports from inspection visits and we never heard ant complaints from neighbours. \n\nFF 14 years later, they're still living there. I've been travelling the world full time for some years, spent the pandemic in Australia then resumed travelling post lock downs. I'm now ready to return home, so I informed my estate agent that I want to break the contract and have them move out in 3 months' time, 2 months more notice than I'm obligated to give. \n\nThe tenants were surprised to hear I was coming back and tried to ask if I was coming to live with my family. The agent brushed off question and told them to vacate in 3 months and that they can help find alternative accommodation. Tenants texted me directly to ask same question and I replied \"haha, no husband or kids in tow - just ready to set roots again! Looking forward to being home\" (I grew up 20 mins aways). I got a text calling me selfish for: kicking them out of their home of nearly 15 years; wanting a big house all to myself; placing my needs of travel and enjoyment ahead of starting a family and getting married. They told me I should leave them to buy the house for what I bought it for (it's doubled in price since) and go live in my other house. I replied \"you can dictate in a house that you own, not one that I own. Please have your things packed by x date or I'll evict you and sue you for the costs\". \n\nMy friends are saying I'm kicking them out of their home and I don't need such a big place so I can rent or sell my student flat for a deposit for a house nearby. My rented house is 90% paid though and I don't want to start again with a new mortgage. I want to live in my house. I have been fair to the tenants and reasonable in my request.

However, it really is the fault of UK law and not OP. A reasonable adjustment to the law to something along the lines of 1 month notice for every full year in residence (potentially to a maximum of 12 months) would more fully take into account the upheaval to the tenants and the fact that purchasing a house is out of reach for many people, and most especially, lifelong renters in the UK. Also the rental market is currently expensive (and often hostile) and unlikely to change any time soon. \n\nSaying that they should have purchased their own home does not take into account the realities of home ownership in the UK, it's just not that simple. However, I agree that the situation is inappropriate to visit upon OP as they do own the property.\n\nI think the tenants went too far with their response to OP,  but the shock of losing their home so suddenly (after 14 years 3 months will feel _very_ sudden) and due to no fault of their own can obviously illicit an extreme (and ill-considered) reaction. They are losing their home, the roots they have put down in the local area as well as potentially losing convenient access to schools, jobs and amenities which makes this such a significant life change that it must feel akin to a bereavement.

Also, the fact that you've owned this house since the age of 23 and also own an apartment proves that you were almost definitely raised by wealthy parents and therefore severely underestimate how privileged you are.\n\nIf what I just said didn't suffice, here are 2 very important things that instantly made my level of sympathy for you drop from 2.5% to 0%:\n\nFirst things first,\n\n\\>\"Please have your things packed by x date or I'll evict you and sue you for the costs\"\n\nYou want to \\*sue\\* them for the costs? You want to sue a couple considerably less wealthy than you for the costs of punishing them for failing to fulfil a difficult, already costly and highly stressful legal obligation, especially considering that that amount of money would be a far smaller burden on you? Do you have \\*\\*any\\*\\* idea how entitled such behaviour is? You are directly contributing to the validity of the saying  [\"poverty charges interest\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/lhagh1/poverty_charges_interest/) .\n\n2nd,\n\nHave you ever considered that perhaps instead of giving them a 3 month notice now, you could have given them a 1 year notice 9 months ago? Why should they bear the burden of your indecisiveness? Or at the very least give them a 6 month notice 3 months ago? Are you aware of the ratio of the burden here: a longer notice means you simply have to wait longer (which you have no real reason to be in a hurry for, as you have a house in Australia and an apartment) while they can get a much longer amount of time to get everything sorted out?\n\nIn conclusion, the \"but it's legal\" blanket that helps you sleep at night is a very thin one.
