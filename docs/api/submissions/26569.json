It was a lovely big house, but the town was not fun for a 23 year old. I always said I'd love it of I were 40 with kids, but it wasn't a great place for someone in their 20s. When I was 26, I put the house on the rental market and moved to London where I lived for 2 years before moving to Australia. \n\nI found a lovely family to rent the house. A husband and wife both in their mid to late 40s with one child, no pets, and respectable jobs. Rent was always paid on time, the estate agent always had good reports from inspection visits and we never heard ant complaints from neighbours. \n\nFF 14 years later, they're still living there. I've been travelling the world full time for some years, spent the pandemic in Australia then resumed travelling post lock downs. I'm now ready to return home, so I informed my estate agent that I want to break the contract and have them move out in 3 months' time, 2 months more notice than I'm obligated to give. \n\nThe tenants were surprised to hear I was coming back and tried to ask if I was coming to live with my family. The agent brushed off question and told them to vacate in 3 months and that they can help find alternative accommodation. Tenants texted me directly to ask same question and I replied \"haha, no husband or kids in tow - just ready to set roots again! Looking forward to being home\" (I grew up 20 mins aways). I got a text calling me selfish for: kicking them out of their home of nearly 15 years; wanting a big house all to myself; placing my needs of travel and enjoyment ahead of starting a family and getting married. They told me I should leave them to buy the house for what I bought it for (it's doubled in price since) and go live in my other house. I replied \"you can dictate in a house that you own, not one that I own. Please have your things packed by x date or I'll evict you and sue you for the costs\". \n\nMy friends are saying I'm kicking them out of their home and I don't need such a big place so I can rent or sell my student flat for a deposit for a house nearby. My rented house is 90% paid though and I don't want to start again with a new mortgage. I want to live in my house. I have been fair to the tenants and reasonable in my request.

It was a lovely big house, but the town was not fun for a 23 year old. I always said I'd love it of I were 40 with kids, but it wasn't a great place for someone in their 20s. When I was 26, I put the house on the rental market and moved to London where I lived for 2 years before moving to Australia. \n\nI found a lovely family to rent the house. A husband and wife both in their mid to late 40s with one child, no pets, and respectable jobs. Rent was always paid on time, the estate agent always had good reports from inspection visits and we never heard ant complaints from neighbours. \n\nFF 14 years later, they're still living there. I've been travelling the world full time for some years, spent the pandemic in Australia then resumed travelling post lock downs. I'm now ready to return home, so I informed my estate agent that I want to break the contract and have them move out in 3 months' time, 2 months more notice than I'm obligated to give. \n\nThe tenants were surprised to hear I was coming back and tried to ask if I was coming to live with my family. The agent brushed off question and told them to vacate in 3 months and that they can help find alternative accommodation. Tenants texted me directly to ask same question and I replied \"haha, no husband or kids in tow - just ready to set roots again! Looking forward to being home\" (I grew up 20 mins aways). I got a text calling me selfish for: kicking them out of their home of nearly 15 years; wanting a big house all to myself; placing my needs of travel and enjoyment ahead of starting a family and getting married. They told me I should leave them to buy the house for what I bought it for (it's doubled in price since) and go live in my other house. I replied \"you can dictate in a house that you own, not one that I own. Please have your things packed by x date or I'll evict you and sue you for the costs\". \n\nMy friends are saying I'm kicking them out of their home and I don't need such a big place so I can rent or sell my student flat for a deposit for a house nearby. My rented house is 90% paid though and I don't want to start again with a new mortgage. I want to live in my house. I have been fair to the tenants and reasonable in my request.

That doesn\u2019t automatically make them an asshole in any situation that involves money in any way.", ">Yes, ultimately that money is going towards the owner\u2019s mortgage.\n\nYou said that, not me. \n\nIt's not reductionist to acknowledge that the main benefit of letting out your house is that someone else pays for the mortgage, amongst other things. It's not a secret. \n\nI understand how rent works, and it is fundamentally built on people's inability to access mortgages that match incomes. That's exploitation. It is. If people could afford deposits, no-one would rent. \n\n>the fact that you think that they\u2019re freely paying OP\u2019s mortgage is hilarious to me\n\nThat's because you're unable to sympathise with other people. Probably best not to advertise that, yeah?", "It's not about empathy.\nMost people these days can't afford the down payment for a house. Yet, it's not OP's fault", "It\u2019s not the lack of empathy, it\u2019s just that you\u2019re tone deaf enough to think the tenants are simply \u201cpaying OPs mortgage.\u201d No, they\u2019re paying to live in a house, genius. Go learn how rent works.", "Have you had to rent or move recently? It's not as easy as that. Houses are being let before they hot the market. You take what you can get. \n\nYou can say you're being pragmatic, but you're just not. The rental market is a losing game for one side.", "They just can't seem to hide their jealousy that OP owns multiple properties and they don't.   \n\n\nOP bought the house 15 years ago - around 2008 when properties were really cheap and she did right choice. Good for her.", "Is that what I said?", "[deleted]", "Because thinking we should have a fairer housing system must mean I\u2019m jealous?", "Yes, and people seem to be judging her for that rather than the actual issue at hand.", "That may be so, but her good luck doesn\u2019t mean she is responsible for providing accommodation to anyone. Certainly OP is better financially than the majority, and I wish I had that privilege, but life is like that. OP is not a charity.", "I am not saying that at all and never claimed to be saying that.\n\nWhat I am saying is that OPs attitude to those that funded their lifestyle is repugnant.", "I'm sorry, what words did I put in your mouth?", "Shelter and a 4 bedroom house for your family to live alone in are not the same thing. They have no right to occupy OPs property beyond the terms of their contract and they have no rights to force an extension of that contract.", "You can word it however you would like, but at the end of the day, it's just one person providing a service and a different person paying for said service. If more people didn't just want a handout, I might be more sympathetic, but most people who have your mindset just have their hands out wanting what would benefit them.", "Do you also get angry at restaurants that charge people for their food? Those greedy restaurant owners pocketing people\u2019s hard earned money\u2026.", "Yeah, I think that phrasing probably wouldn't have raised any red flags for me. But either way, I'm glad to have gotten the clear explanation. After 14 years, I'm sure the renters are feeling blindsided, but three months is certainly more notice than my landlord would give me.", "You must really lack reading comprehension to make the leap that I somehow lack sympathy (you said empathy in your last comment before, I think you need to learn that these two words mean different things). \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m done arguing with morons on the internet. Go enjoy yourself on your weird high horse.", "You're all over this thread railing against OP for being able to afford the house in the first place. \n\nThis is how the world works, dude: the people with money have it easier. It sucks if you don't have money. It's not fair\u2014but then again, nothing is. \n\nYou wouldn't be bitching that \"OP had her mortgage paid for\" if she was an investor who's portfolio paid dividends, but because you know the specific family who were paying for her house (while also benefitting themselves by having a place to live that they couldn't otherwise afford) that somehow makes her immoral for making money off them?\n\nIn writing this I realized I actually don't give a shit what you think so GL with that attitude because I don't care lol. I'm sure it'll get you far in life", "Are you implying I want to fuck OP because I understand how rental agreements work?", "You are blaming OP for a structural problem", "What about streaming services like Youtube, Spotify, Netflix etc. Damn greedy bastards expecting to get paid for providing the service /s", ">you said empathy in your last comment before, I think you need to learn that these two words mean different things\n\nThis isn't a gotcha moment for you. You clearly lack sympathy *and* empathy, but that's to be expected from incellious trolls.", "Landlords are leaches", "Only if they buy several unities only to rent out. Seems OP had one, two properties at most. That's not predatory", "Nah they are leeches, and i would lile to live on a world that doesnt have landlords"]}
