We\u2019re coming from Colorado where we first began cohabitating together and now carrying that on in The Big Apple. We have a little less space now but I don\u2019t think that bothers either of us too much. Even despite this move, my gf and I have always been open and transparent when it comes to having our own individual lives away from each other. We love each other very much but we understand that having a healthy relationship can often act as a byproduct to having a healthy individual state of mind. While we prioritize spending time together, we also hold doing things individually with high importance. \n\nSo now that we\u2019re in NYC, we both needed gym memberships. In our search I found a gym that I felt confidently would meet all my needs. I was pretty sure it was the perfect fit. She was simultaneously doing her own search but for whatever reason didn\u2019t come across the gym that I had found and was generally underwhelmed with what she had found. She wasn\u2019t that excited about any of them. She wanted me to tell her about the one that I had found so she could consider joining herself. So I told her the name, she looked it up, and was very interested. It checked all her boxes as well. I told her that I\u2019d prefer to keep the gym as separate activities \u2014 a space we could each have for ourselves. Or in other words \u2014 don\u2019t join the same gym I\u2019m joining. I felt particularly strong about this considering we\u2019re living in a small apartment now and I was clinging to the idea of a gym as my own personal getaway whenever needed. \n\nAt first her reaction was only slightly negative. I explained why I felt this way and ultimately, she said she understood. I\u2019ve since joined that gym and have been going regularly. But whenever I come home and she asks me, \u201chow was it?\u201d, I tell her \u201cgreat\u201d and then I just feel a massive amount of guilt because I know she\u2019d like to be a member as well. \n\nAITA?\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: Clear consensus here that IATA. That\u2019s fair. Although one thing I\u2019d like to clear up \u2014 lots of people seem to think my motivation behind this is so that I can gawk, hit on, and maybe even sleep with other women at the gym in peace! Even if I were very very single, I would never invade someone\u2019s personal space at a place like a gym. It\u2019s a safe space where people go for mental and physical health. I would never deteriorate that environment for someone else because I think they\u2019re attractive. \n\nAnyways, I apologized to my gf earlier today. She\u2019s scheduled a tour of the gym for this weekend. I told her I\u2019ll use all the referral credits I get from the gym if she signs up to go out to a nice dinner together. \n\nWe\u2019re all assholes sometimes! But this makes me feel lucky to have her. I always knew she was the actual better half. She continues to show it too.

But it does get tired when the speculation falls back into the worn trope of \"men are horrible cheating liars, who need to fully protect and care for women, who are helpless and have no agency.\"", "Just because they are members at the same gym doesn't mean they have to go at the same time.", "I guess that would depend on their work/school schedules.", "sorry I\u2019m late", "Ok take my poor people award", "I like fairly regular time and space away from my husband, because I lived alone for a long time before moving in with him and am also an introvert. But I don\u2019t need a secret space away from him that he\u2019s not allowed to enter at all, No Boys Allowed style lmao. \n\nIf anything, I really love introducing my husband to a cool space I\u2019ve found that I enjoy, even if I mostly enjoy spending time there on my own.", "I wish my mom was like your dad. She had to keep me in the loop on every single machine she was going to do or she'd want to have a big conversation while doing cardio. Meanwhile, I can't breathe and feel like I\"m dying.", "That sounds really nice. At our house we have our separate spaces but we spend most of our time in common spaces. We're both homebodies though but we for sure spend plenty of time out of the house separately doing separate activities, or with one of us at home. Often me. So that's probably why I don't feel the need for any extra solitude or a special place to completely get away from it all. It just seems suspicious almost to me to need such regular complete disconnect from your partner.", "I know you\u2019ve already accepted your judgment but I think it\u2019s important to consider how important exercise is for mental health, and given that she couldn\u2019t find a gym she liked, it probably really bummed her out that she wasn\u2019t able to have that outlet as well. \n\nAlso you were super gracious with your verdict and your actions to mend the relationship, which makes you TA no longer! \n\nI\u2019m glad you guys worked it out! (Pun intended)", "NTA - after your edit, well done on taking criticism and learning from it :)", "YTA. \n\nYou can go at different times and the gym will still be \"your personal getaway\".", "NTA you said y'all do things seprate a lot so it not wrong you would like to fill freee to be in a place you know no one so  ignore all those comments saying your trying to cheat there just bad people there the problem why men don't trust females", "YTA. Why not just go at different times? Then you both get solo gym time and solo time at home.", "Wow lot of conclusions being jumped to. I'm gonna be controversial and say, with this info, NTA. We all need space, especially in marriages. It's a safezone and some people actually go to the gym to get away.", "The only reason I see for op to not want his girlfriend to use the same gym is because he\u2019s scoping out other women there. I can\u2019t make sense of his reasoning he says of wanting downtime or privacy. Dude you can still go by yourself, it just doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019m honestly surprised that the girlfriend isn\u2019t more pissed about what he said because honestly it sounds like bullshit to me.", "I'm glad you sorted this out.", "You\u2019re a dick. Go at separate times or make time to go together. Maybe her safe space is with you in a new city doing something y\u2019all both love. You trippin B! Hope y\u2019all figure it out!", "YTA for that virtue signalling edit. So many couples I've known met each other at the gym, people need to get over themselves.", "NTA: I totally understand and always see how couples act at the gym, most are cringy and theres a certain level of insecurity involved. I workout alone and prefer to keep it that way.", "Yta. You don\u2019t owe the gym. Also, belonging to the same gym, doesn\u2019t mean you go at the same time and work out next to each other. You will be space", "NTA u stated your boundaries an she trampled all over it also the sub is full of weird ppl I stg just because the OP doesn\u2019t wanna be in the same setting as His Gf doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s out cheating holy shit sum of ya need a reality check n stop reading wattpad", "Hell I joined the same gym as my wife so we could go together and be gym buddies. We don't even use the same machines or rooms even. Idk wtf he's thinking lol.", "Reddit jumps far into conclusions", "Why did I know that someone has to come to this conclusion? Reddit \ud83d\ude44\nI do understand why he wants some alone time or have a hobby that he doesn't share with his partner. However, as much as I understand his needs for a place exclusively for him, he can't just forbid his partner to join a club just because he found it first.", "Fucking weird thought process. Yta", "You\u2019re in your 30\u2019s\u2026.you and your s/o can go to the same gym. It\u2019ll be okay.", "NTA imo.", "You\u2019re definitely cheating at the gym aren\u2019t you lmao", "NTA! To me the only reason why ur an AH here is because ur not thinking of ur own well being here. Alone time is very important for everybody, it helps us re-energise and unfog our brains. So ur being an AH to urself. \n\n You should of kept the rule going of having stuff kept to yourselves", "YTA", "Yta, why does it even matter if she's at the same gym member or different one? Ya'll can pick different times to go there if its so important. For example one goes at morning and the other one at evening. Why you would want her to have lesser quality of life and experiences over such trivial thing?", "NTA because of your edit where you recognized your mistake and made it up to your wife. You seem like a good dude OP. I bet you wouldn\u2019t try to steal a measly $200 from your wife like u/NorthEazy. This is how you take a judgement with grace and use it to become a better, more empathetic person.", "Yta", "NTA. I may be late to the party but I can understand the need to have a space where you feel free to indulge ME time. Rather than bar her from joining the same gym, though, you could have gone to the gym on different days. Or reached an agreement that you would not engage each other while working out. Most people I know are in the gym to work out, not to flirt or run their mouths. And unlike others, your wanting your own individual space and time has NOTHING to do with wanting to flirt or have a wandering eye. Really, if you want to cheat, the gym may be the worst place to pick someone up.", "You could always go at different times. Have you ever thought of that?!", "As an introvert, I totally believe that he needs space sometimes.   100%.   I love my friends but I also need my recovery/alone time.  BTW, I love now and am not erasing the \"As a ...\" start, even though it's a sad reddit cliche.", "You've summoned the potato people", "Reading your edit is lovely.  So glad you have reached a better understanding of each other. Sounds like a great relationship.\nNAH", "Classics AITA\u2026speculating and making up a narrative, then giving each other high fives and awards for another successful \u201ctakedown\u201d.", "I don\u2019t know how this happened.. or if it was planned.. but either way you get an award from me..", "This is a beautiful resolution.", "I get where you're coming from, but no need to worry. My boyfriend and I go to the same Gym, often together, but we do our own thing and only meet up in the end to head back home. For me it still feels as alone time. :)\nGood luck!", "YTA. But thankfully not actually an asshole because you realised the error of your ways. Good for you."]}
