We have a little less space now but I don\u2019t think that bothers either of us too much. Even despite this move, my gf and I have always been open and transparent when it comes to having our own individual lives away from each other. We love each other very much but we understand that having a healthy relationship can often act as a byproduct to having a healthy individual state of mind. While we prioritize spending time together, we also hold doing things individually with high importance. \n\nSo now that we\u2019re in NYC, we both needed gym memberships. In our search I found a gym that I felt confidently would meet all my needs. I was pretty sure it was the perfect fit. She was simultaneously doing her own search but for whatever reason didn\u2019t come across the gym that I had found and was generally underwhelmed with what she had found. She wasn\u2019t that excited about any of them. She wanted me to tell her about the one that I had found so she could consider joining herself. So I told her the name, she looked it up, and was very interested. It checked all her boxes as well. I told her that I\u2019d prefer to keep the gym as separate activities \u2014 a space we could each have for ourselves. Or in other words \u2014 don\u2019t join the same gym I\u2019m joining. I felt particularly strong about this considering we\u2019re living in a small apartment now and I was clinging to the idea of a gym as my own personal getaway whenever needed. \n\nAt first her reaction was only slightly negative. I explained why I felt this way and ultimately, she said she understood. I\u2019ve since joined that gym and have been going regularly. But whenever I come home and she asks me, \u201chow was it?\u201d, I tell her \u201cgreat\u201d and then I just feel a massive amount of guilt because I know she\u2019d like to be a member as well. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669815864, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8rv47/aita_for_telling_my_partner_not_to_join_the_same/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Simply saying he doesn\u2019t want her to join doesn\u2019t actually prevent her from joining or discussing the matter.\n\nPlus is NY so limited that there is only one decent gym that can meet their needs?", "\"or\"? But that's the same thing", "Doubt OP will admit this.", "Agreed and OP feels guilty because he knows she wants to join the gym and he\u2019s being a jerk.", "He\u2019s still an AH for attempting to play gatekeeper.  Even if they went at the same time I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be doing their own **separate** thing.\n\nIt would be like her saying \u201chey I\u2019m gonna be at this coffee shop I want alone time you can\u2019t come to the shop\u201d.\n\nNobody should be able to stop somebody from going somewhere.", "You say potato, I say potato..\ud83d\ude04", "Well, some people unapologetically flirt even if it\u2019s they\u2019re known they\u2019re married/engaged/etc. Others really like to hide that detail, or like to have a life on the side where they want to appear single.", "By your logic, being in different rooms in the house constitutes alone time. It may be for you but OP wants to maintain his own safe space. He doesn\u2019t want to be in the same place doing something different. He wants time away from her. \n\nWhy would he go to the cafe if it\u2019s her safe space to be alone? He can certainly tell her why he also wants to go there so she has the option of not going.\n\nOP voiced his opinion, he didn\u2019t gatekeep anything. Healthy relationships require communication. She can communicate if she disagrees and still join, in which case OP may change gyms. Imagine joining the same gym as your SO and your boyfriend changes gyms without explanation.\n\nIt shocks me that men aren\u2019t allowed to express their need for a safe individual space, in a calm and respectful manner.", "Everyone is entitled to their safe space sure. However they can go at different times and his safe space is still intact.  They don\u2019t have to go at the same time.\n\nThe girlfriend has already voiced she\u2019s not comfortable at any other gyms and she wanted to join his.  He told her no he\u2019d prefer separate gyms.  What more should she do to communicate with him??  Why should she suffer because he doesn\u2019t want her at \u201chis gym\u201d when they could work out a schedule to go separately??\n\nDon\u2019t turn this into a man vs woman debate."]}
