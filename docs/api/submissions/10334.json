Nobody has done anything wrong here.  He may have changed his mind out of \"oh yeah, probably should just do the walk\" or the fact that it's two people walking and one waiting which would feel weird.\n\nEither way, no harm done to anyone.", "NAH. I think it is quite normal for one person to go and fetch the car, but I also understand your reasoning. I think he felt uncomfortable with the idea of him being the only staying dry while you voiced you didn't like this idea, but it's not really your problem he reacted like this.", "INFO: did you have umbrellas?", "Nah not everything makes someone an ah", "NAH. Even if he seemed uncomfortable, he didn't attack you for it. There doesn't really seem to be a conflict her. Unless there is more INFO that we're lacking? You wanted to go with your friend, that's great! Her bf decided to change his mind and come along despite discomfort? Great as well! Don't stress yourself about something that doesn't have to be an issue :>", "NAH.\n\nBut why would you unnecessarily walk in the rain? It's not like you were helping your friend stay dry. You are just doubling the number of wet people in the car.  \n\nYou are still NTA, but it doesn't make sense. Is it so awkward standing next to her boyfriend for a few minutes that you would feel more comfortable in the rain?", "No you're NTA. You did what you felt was right. You don't really owe anything to the guy. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Tbh, your friend was gonna get wet regardless, and now, there are 3 dripping wet people in her car instead of 1. \n\nAlthough I get your point, solidarity and all that. \n\nNAH", "NTA, I often joke to my wife about sending her to the car when it\u2019s raining but I would never actually do it as I\u2019m a person capable of functioning in society", "NTA\n\nNot very cool to make his girlfriend walk two blocks while he's waiting someplace warm and dry. He would be right to be embarrassed.", "NTA in my opinion", "Nta. This is not something to worry about.", "NTA. He is, though, for letting his gf walk 2 blocks in the rain to get the car to pick him up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's understandable that you didn't want your friend to walk alone in the rain and wanted to join her. It's also okay for your friend's boyfriend to change his mind and join you, even if he initially felt uncomfortable about it. It's ultimately up to him to decide whether he wants to walk in the rain or not, and your friend offered him an out if he didn't want to. It's not your responsibility to make him feel comfortable, but you could have perhaps explained your reasoning to him to help him understand your perspective. In the end, it seems like everyone was able to get to the car safely and without any major issues. So, no, you're not the asshole for saying you'd walk in the rain and making your friend's boyfriend uncomfortable.", "nah but maybe the person who owned the car didnt want a bunch of people with wet clothes sitting in the car", "Yes, we had two. But it was quite windy and it kept folding up.", "It just felt wrong and I reacted by disagreeing. She went out of her way to pick us up at our places and drive us there. At the moment, my reaction was to say \u201cif one of us has to suffer, we should all do it together\u201d. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about being uncomfortable with him and the number of wet people in the car didn\u2019t even cross my mind. She asked if we wanted her to pick up the car while we waited and I just reacted by saying no.", "He didn't send her to pick up the car though - she offered.", "Maybe he can't drive? \nThis is kind of sexist, though. Would you have reacted the same if their genders were opposite?", "We live on a beach town. The seats are waterproof and she had towels on the car. The wetting of the seat really wasn\u2019t an issue.", "Still, then NAH.  If I were her I wouldn't have minded if you guys didn't go.", "That sounds like unnecessarily increasing the amount of suffering. It's not helping anyone. Your friend isn't feeling better by seeing people suffer alongside her. If anything, you just made her car seats more wet.\n\nYou're still NTA. It's just a weird reaction.", "I am of the same mind as you. If I'm in a car with someone and they stop to get gas, I get out of the car with them to keep them company. If also definitely walk with them in the rain to their parking spot.\n\nIt's baffling to me that some people wouldn't.\n\nNTA\n\n(And I think bf is just upset you came across as more compassionate than he is (because you are))", "I'm saying he should have walked WITH her, unless there is a reason he couldn't. I drove my now husband plenty when we were dating. That's not my issue. My issue is the person that the driver is dating was happy to let her walk 2 blocks in the rain alone to get the car to pick him up, rather than walking with her. I think if they were dating he should have been walking with her as well unless he couldn't.", "You have obviously never heard the idiom misery loves company.", "I get the sentiment, but if it's raining enough to warrant an offer of pick up, for ~4-7min(per OP\u2019s 2 blocks). I'd rather my car be less wet/moisture overall.\n\nBut I live/grew up where rain can very a lot, everyone has rain jackets they wear 60-80% of the time and 50/50 umbrella usage. So it be more than a light rain to offer a pick-up.", "Also, misery shared halves it. Happiness shared doubles it.", "YTA for making this post lmao. There is zero conflict or moral ambiguity here.", "Nta"]}
