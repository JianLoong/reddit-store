We grew up in a small town. We were friendly, went to the same school, but we never were in the same clique. She was one of the popular kids and I wasn\u2019t.   \nA few years after college, I moved back home when my dad got sick. I found a job in my field about 45 minutes away from home. I would help take my dad to his chemo appointments. It was during one of those appointments I ran into EX.  She was now a worked at the hospital. One day while waiting, I asked her out.    \nIt turned out we shared a lot of the same interests. It seemed like our relationship was going great. About a year or so into dating EX and I moved into a rented house together. The following year, I proposed. We began looking for a house. EX always wanted to live in her grandparents\u2019 house on the lake near our town. Her family was forced to sell house when her grandparents died because of an inheritance dispute. 6 months before our wedding, a chance event happened. The couple who bought her grandparents lake house had grown tired of our snowy winters. It took some work and nearly all of my savings, but I was able to buy her dream house. It was going to be my surprise wedding present so I didn\u2019t dare tell her or anyone in her family my plans.   \nA month before our wedding, EX and her friends went to Miami for her bachelorette party. I am not sure all of what happened there, part of me doesn\u2019t really want to know, but I do know her high school BF was there. When she got back, from the trip, she broke down and confessed she was afraid to get married and wanted to call it off. It was a mess. She later moved to Florida and eventually married HS BF. \n\nI ended up moving back to the city for an amazing job. In the meantime, I still had the lake house. With the help of my mom and dad, we started to fix up the lake house. It took a few years. My mom and dad would look after the contractors while I was in the city. Having the house was perfect when the everything locked down. I was able to escape the city and work remotely from the lake house. I now live here full time and work remotely.  \nThis summer we had 4th of July at the Lake House. My SIL used photos from the lake this summer in her Christmas card. One of those cards made it to EX\u2019s cousin. The cousin recognized the house. The Saturday before new year\u2019s EX\u2019s Mother and Sister were at my front door. After pleasantries and answering their initial questions, they made an offer to buy it. I refused. They were not happy.  \nA few days I got a long txt from EX. This was the first time in about 9 years she has talked with me. She called me an ass for keeping this from her. Her family is blaming her for losing the house again. She then asked me sell. I still have no intention to sell. Now her and her family are complaining on social media that this is some sort of revenge.

Action. I never told my EX that I bought her grandparents old house. It was her dream house.  I kept it a secret from her and her family. It was supposed to be a surprise wedding gift, but when she called off our wedding, I never told her. \n\n2. Why that action might make me the asshole: Because it was her dream house, and that her  and her family had years of memories there and they were devastated when they had to sell because her parents, aunts, and uncles couldn't agree on ownership when her grandparents passed.

Your intention was to surprise your ex with the house at the wedding.  If you had called off the wedding, I\u2019d reconsider my judgement but she is the reason why she doesn\u2019t have access to that house.  On top of that, you\u2019ve made the house your own.

Enjoy your sweet lake house that now belongs to your family. \n\nThe ex (and her family) are just salty because they realized what they missed out on. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t even reply. Just block and never think of her again", "NTA.  Why would you tell the woman who dumped you before the wedding anything?  Your purchases are none of her business and her family has some fucking audacity to show up on your doorstep.", "Show her the contract of when you bought it. Make sure she knows that she burned herself when she torched you. You bought it with the best of intentions. She left you. NTA", "NTA. So...after more than 10 years and a presumably expensive renovation, your ex and her family want the lake house back. What a lot of gall they have!

They can eat their sour grapes and get lost.", "NTA\n\n>Now her and her family are complaining on social media that this is some sort of revenge\n\nTell them they're right, because \"Living well is the best revenge.\". And that's what you're doing, living well, in the house you intended to share with your ex-fiancee.", "you are most definitely NTA, and you sound like a pretty great dude. hell, you bought your ex an entire house as a wedding gift! if it was so important for her family to get it back, they should have paid closer attention to if it was on the market. you put tons of work and money into this house, you deserve it!!", "Tell her the story:\n\" I brought it as weddding gift for you, but you decide to cheat on me and marry another guy. Fuck you and your family. Never contact me ever again, you are awful human beings, you deserve all bad karma, i plan to life in this house with my family in the future, let me alone, bye\"\n\nThis would feel so good for you, believe me write these stuff and it will destroy her.", "Nta. I'd pour salt in the wound and tell her why you initially bought it", "NTA you had no intention of using this as revenge. That is just how it turned out. Technically, we can call this karma. You never rubbed it her face, obviously since it has been 9 years.", "NTA - The audacity of them to feel entitled to your home. Like rubbing salt in a sword wound. You secured this for her. She left the relationship. Block their noise and boot them out of your head...you-are-not-the-asshole. \n\n\\*\\*File the statements of revenge with the police. It may seem 'not that important' but do it; even if the police are not enthusiastic. If damage ( e.g., arson) occurs every person involved in revenge talk will become top suspects. Also be sure your home is insured to 'rebuild'...these costs climb every year.", "NTA. It sounds like they possibly think you bought it to spite her.   Show them the property records/ whatever proof on social media as to purchase date.  Say I bought this as a wedding gift surprise for my then bride to be.    Since she cheated and broke up with me weeks before the wedding I have no interest, desire, or reason to give it to her.", "It\u2019s been 9 years, she screwed up and her family and her need to move on. Tell them you will take their number and should you ever decide to sell you will let them know. They can blame her, it seems right but you are not an ass. You had planned a grand gesture and she screwed up. You have worked to make the house a home and you live there and I assume love it. You don\u2019t owe her or them anything.\n\nIf they really wanted that home they should have been keeping an eye on it and bought it when you did. You enjoy your life", "NTA and ummmmm what if it was revenge? Who cares?\n\nThe house was available, you liked it and you bought it. If doing all that also resulted in a huge F you to the ex fianc\u00e9 who cheated on you and left you, then all the better. \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA and funnier than shit. I'd now be posting daily updates from life around the house. Then maybe tag the ex and say this could have been yours...lol", "NTA\u2026 and seriously if she knew that you bought the house back then she would have married you FOR THE HOUSE! Your life would have been hell. She would have fought you for the deed in divorce and you would have probably lost everything and the house. Thank goodness you didn\u2019t put her name on the deed!! The house is yours; not theirs and hasn\u2019t been theirs for decades! If you decide to sell her family can try to buy it (if they have the better offer). So enjoy your home and maybe purchase a gate to prevent unwanted guests from coming to the door", "NTA- But let me get this straight, for 9 years they have never reach out to the \u201cowners\u201d (not knowing that it was you) of the lake house, to buy back the property once they financially could. They lost it because of an inheritance dispute, so they clearly didn\u2019t care about the property, but wanted whatever inheritance they were fighting over. I am assuming they have never reached back out to you after your ex cheated and cut ties with you. \n\nSo now that they know it\u2019s you, they show up and have some \u201cpleasantry\u201d and ask with the expectation, that you sell them back the house. \n\nAnd not the ex who \u201cwas afraid to get married and called it off\u201d and who then proceeded to move to Florida to be with and eventually marry the guy she cheated on you with calling you (9 YEAES LATER) upset that you didn\u2019t tell her about your purchase/gift for her, for when you got married. As if you owe it to her (explain that mental gymnastics\u2026) because her family is pissed. Did I get that right?\n\nYeah\u2026.NTA. Enjoy your life and that house and if they keep harassing you tell her Husband that she won\u2019t stop calling you and get a restraining order on her family if you can.", "You're NTA, a great guy and a king.   Never let go of this house.  I hope her family never forgets how she fucked you over.", "Man some people are so dumb. \n\nI would 100% tell her everything. That I bought the house for a wedding present and I wanted to live happily ever after with her. \n\nAnd then I would proceed to thank her for influencing you to buy the house and that you've loved it and you're going to continue to love it and we will be passing it down to your children. \n\nI would probably go full bore on her because she deserves it. \n\n100% NTA.", "NTA, keep the house, and set up cameras/security if you haven\u2019t already.", "NTA!  These people have brass balls! what nerve! Even if you are \"seeking revenge\", so what??   \nThank goodness that you didn't get married or put her name on the deed!!  \nEnjoy your house!", "NTA. She moved to another state and cut contact. Were you supposed to track her down? Tell her you sent a carrier pigeon, but it must have gotten eaten by a gator before it got to her. Block all of them and live a good life.", "NTA \n\nBut I\u2019d put on social media exactly what you put here - that you bought the house as a surprise wedding present, your ex ended the relationship to go back to the HS boyfriend after spending time with him on her bachelorette trip, and you and your parents have spent time and effort together fixing it up and it has meaning to you that way. \n\nShe made her choices, you\u2019re under no obligation to sell.", "NTA. Honestly sounds pretty traumatizing", "NTA. Reply with the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The truth shall damn them all", "NTA. She could have had the house but she decided to play some games instead. Once the two of you are broken up you don\u2019t owe each other anything.", "NTA. I\u2019d make sure that she knows that you bought it as a surprise wedding gift, but she blew it (so to speak) with her ex during that bachelorette trip. It\u2019s extremely brazen and selfish to demand that you sell the house to them.\n\nEdit: It\u2019s doubly important that they know when and why you bought it given their accusations.", "Nta . Forget those losers you played your hand right , don\u2019t even lose sleep.", "So She probably cheated on you with her HS BF now husband. And wants you to sell the house.

NTA", "NTA\n\nRevenge would be telling them that you bought it as a wedding surprise, but then your ex cheated on you and canceled the wedding.

I'd be petty and post on social media that you bought this house specifically as a wedding present and it is not your fault your fiance went and slept with her ex boyfriend and then dumped you 2 weeks before the wedding. You made the best of the situation and made the house yours. It's not like you rubbed it in her face the last 9 years.", "NTA I couldn't help laughing at the irony.

If they offer five or ten times the value and sad circumstances force you into accepting that then you should, but it is your house now.\n\nIf you *do* want to make some absurd demand then you can, though, like I said, that isn't nice and they will not be happy even if they have the money.", "NTA - you dodged a bullet!

You were not obligated to tell her when she bailed on your relationship.", "Hell no NTA. Actions have consequences. Just because she didn\u2019t know what they were when she did the bad things doesn\u2019t mean she gets to be upset. She can be disappointed all on her own.  Fact of the matter is- if they didn\u2019t know you, they wouldn\u2019t even have dared approach you to ask you to sell it. They\u2019d already written it off. If anyone is holding onto connections in this issue, it\u2019s them. They proved that by coming and asking you in the first place. And the fact of the matter for YOU is, you don\u2019t owe them a god damn thing. You put in the work and bought the place. They could have put in the effort if they cared that much. You spent time and money over years to fix it up. I doubt they could afford the appreciation that property has gone through. YOU ARE NOT CONNECTED ANYMORE AND YOU OWE THEM NOTHING. Sometimes life just gives us little spicy delicious moments like this, as a bonus. Especially when we weren\u2019t even looking for them. \n\nI do recommend cameras though. They feel entitled to this house cause they lost it, and because they believe their \u201cold connection\u201d to you grants them something. They may try to start shit to encourage you to move out.

She's been feeling that way for a while and had confided those feelings to some of her friends.  One of them may have let ex bf know that \"hey, she'll be in town this weekend, OP won't be here, and she's having second thoughts.  If you're interested, maybe you should drop by and say hi and see what happens.\"  \n\nWhether or not she \"cheated\" is dependent on where you draw the line.  Did they or not bang at one extreme.  Having a short conversation at the other.  Ultimately, she immediately returned and broke it off with OP.  If something \"happened\" between her and her ex, then fine.  Call it cheating.  If all they did was meet and exchange pleasantries and the surge of memories of another life and another love was enough of a jolt to break her out of the mundane path she was on for a lifetime she wasn't looking forward to, then she did the best she could with the situation.  Call her an asshole because she should have communicated her feelings better to the person she was supposed to marry and maybe all of this could have been avoided, but in the end, I feel she made the right choice for her.  If might not have been what OP preferred at the time, but I'm guessing he ultimately got the better end of the deal.\n\nAs far as the house goes, too bad, so sad.  Her \"family\" was never interested in it.  If they were, some member of her extended family would have bought it up from the grandparents in the first place to \"keep it in the family\".  If OP's ex fianc\u00e9 really wanted it, she would have kept an eye on it as well.  She would have known a LONG time ago that OP now owned it and could have made an offer years ago, before he put all of the sweat equity into it and made it his own.  \n\nHowever, there might be another chance for her to own it.  OP's made no mention about new relationships or getting married to someone else.  It's always possible that a new wife might not feel comfortable living in a house that was specifically bought as a wedding present for an ex.  Similar to not wanting to wear an engagement ring that he tried to give to a previous girl.  It might not be obtuse, but the occasional muttering will be made about the original intent of the house purchase and the fact that her family today is trying to reacquire it.

I don't know who you intend to address it to -- the girl, the mom?  But I think info about the sale of property can be found online, but if not, maybe the county Lands Records Department. OP can find that out.\nPoint being, if the Records show it was purchased  BEFORE the wedding, therein lies the truth. Bought before the wedding as a surprise for the then fiancee.

It\u2019s much more likely this is not one of them. \n\nShe no doubt screwed around with the old boyfriend on the trip, so she got her comeuppance in the end. OP did nothing out of spite. If he wanted to be spiteful, he would\u2019ve thrown the house in her face 9 years before. She has no right to demand he sell it or to blast him publicly. Funny, no one knocked on the door asking to buy the house in the 9 years he owned it? They\u2019re only pissed because it\u2019s HIM who owns it. She has a lot of balls even reaching out to him.

Or am I reading that wrong?", "> But if you are a good person, and you find that you are that level of interested in an ex, the right thing to do is break things off immediately rather than cheat.

People can be very hostile to out-group. A county clerk can ruin your month. A grumpy sheriff can ruin your year. Your kids not being included in team or activity can be terrible.\n\nMaybe you're ok with being alone and being isolated. But most people aren't.

Your chicken is my yard.)", "That small town gossip chain means the town already knows about the called off wedding after the HS BF just happened to be invited, and a good number of folks knew he bought the house when he did and worked out why.  He can let the gossip chain take care of itself, as ignoring the complaints is going to make the ex and her family look petty when he never made a thing about it in any forum despite years of opportunity."]}
