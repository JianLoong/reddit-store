They\u2019re moving in with the husband\u2019s mother and they have Covid so they are to be staying here in the meantime until she recovers. \n\nFor a bit of backstory, I heavily dislike my sister. For most of my childhood she mentally and abused me and caused a lot of the trauma I have to this day that I\u2019m working with my therapist. She mentally and physically abused me up until the point I was in 5th/6th grade. From then, she caused so much havoc and drama in my house that I became clinically depressed at 12 . She eventually left my life when I was around 13-14 and she\u2019s been hoping from state to state with her husband. The last time I saw her was when I was a senior in high school which was about 5 or so years ago and it was only for a day. I worked a bunch during that time so I maybe saw her for an hour or so. \n\nSince then my sister has had 4 kids and they were all reported sick. Most of them has the flu and one of them even was in the hospital recently. I have literally no relationship with any of them as I have no relationship with my sister. I only know 2 of their names and even then, I don\u2019t know what they look like nor their birthdays. I also dislike her husband as he is the definition of a dead beat. All he does, from what I\u2019ve heard from my parents, is play video games and smoke weed. He just got his GED last year and he is in his 30s with 4 kids. He just got one of his firsts job this year too..\n\n\nI told my mom and dad that if we are all voting on this, I vote no. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m mentally ready for them to stay here, I just started my first career oriented job as I finished college in May, and I don\u2019t wanna get the flu nor get sick and have to take time off. I also stated that if they have to stay here I\u2019d like to keep my room at the very least. All my wishes were declined and they were planning to even give the kids, all four of them, my room when we have an empty up stairs living room, an empty entertainment room, and an empty office space for them to use. My mother also inquired that if they wanted to use my things would I be ok with that? I told her no and my family blew up on me.

They also stated that I\u2019m lucky to be there with them and that I should be lucky to even be having this conversation with them as they could just demand I do what they say. \n\nI told them that if they were going to act this way I may just stay at somewhere else while they\u2019re here.", "created_utc": 1669661843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z74ya3/aita_for_not_wanting_my_sister_and_her_family_to/", "score": 174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Find another place to stay while they're there and bring all your stuff.", "If you go somewhere else, pack up your stuff and make sure they cannot get to it - especially your figurines.  It might be worth it to rent a storage place for a while.  You can get small ones that are closet sized for not much.\n\nINFO:  If mom wants them to go into your room, where does she plan on putting you?", "NTA. I would pack up your collectibles and anything of value and move it off site immediately. Then I would look at finding somewhere else to move. Do you have any friends you could crash with temporarily while you look for something more permanent? Your parents clearly aren\u2019t safe people if they allowed her to abuse you and are telling you they can demand you comply with their wishes as you\u2019re lucky to be living there. That\u2019s not a family. That\u2019s a controlling and abusive situation that you need to get out of ASAP.", "NTA - Make it simple and move out. Put your important things into storage and bounce. Because if the break your stuff no one will pay you back, even if they know they are wrong.", "Get your belongings out of your room now! Maybe a friend can store them or get a storage for it - everything will be used and probably damaged otherwise.\nLook into a (shared) flat and leave as soon as you can.\nNTA ofc. Sorry to hear all of that", "[deleted]", "This is my best advice to you, and I mean this sincerely:\n\nAs a trauma survivor, I know what you\u2019re dealing with and the fear that accompanies it. If I was forced to be in the same household as my abuser, I would constantly suffer from triggers, and I dealt with abuse my entire life- from childhood all the way through my first marriage. I was severely mentally, emotionally, verbally and even sexually abused, and my entire life now is filled with flashbacks due to triggers that are constant reminders of the past, but like you, I have been working on managing my triggers with my therapist and psychiatrist, but I have had PTSD as a full blown disability for the past 10+ years and I\u2019ve spent many years dealing with debilitating flashbacks, nightmares and triggers.\n\nYour parents are blaming you for the situation and trying to force you to comply. You have been working on managing your symptoms and they aren\u2019t seeing that this may very well set back your progress and may end up retraumatizing you again. I\u2019ve been through retraumatization multiple times due to various traumas and this is, I promise you, the last thing you want.\n\nFrom my perspective, if your parents tolerated this behavior when you were young, if by chance your sister hasn\u2019t changed at all and is still the same type of person, they will continue to tolerate it. It is very obvious that they are taking her side and will end up enabling her, and I know that this is their daughter too and they want to help her out, but she and her husband are just as capable of finding another temporary place to stay as your parents say you are.\n\nSo this is my advice: I think if you have the means and are capable, you should find another place to stay. If you can afford it and are old enough, please move out on your own. You will suffer if you\u2019re forced to see her face every day and will continue to live through the trauma because her face will be a constant reminder of what you went through and will likely take you back to the past repeatedly. If you leave, you will have the peace and solace of removing yourself from a toxic environment. The environment you are living in is poisonous and will destroy you mentally and emotionally.\n\nYou deserve better, and once you get out on your own, you will be free to work on your problems and your mental health without judgment, without fear, without painful reminders constantly around you, and without people who will hold you back from getting better. You are stronger than you know. You survived your trauma and you are still here, and for that, you have more strength and courage than many people can imagine.\n\nI wish you the best in life, and I hope you find yourself in the best of circumstances. You need to be able to move forward from the past, not forced to live through it again. Good luck to you, and I sincerely hope you are able to get yourself out of the situation. Reach out to your closest support system and use whatever resources you have available to you to help you safely get out.\n\nFinal note: From survivor to survivor, stay strong. You\u2019re not alone. I\u2019m also with you in this, just as millions of others are. We may make up a small fraction of the population, but we are strong and we know what it\u2019s like to get through the worst of circumstances and to come out of them alive and even stronger. I stand with you, and I know things will get better. Just keep working on yourself and keep moving forward, and you will get through this, I promise. \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc99\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc\n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m pretty sure I read this right, but I had to double check. The same sister who tormented you as a kid and who you haven\u2019t had a relationship with is invading your room basically without your consent and now shaming  you for not doing everything they want? Even though simultaneously, they\u2019re manipulating you to do that anyways?\n\nYour family is in the wrong.

If you live with your parents you do not get to dictate who comes to stay there, but your personal possessions are exactly that - YOUR PERSONAL items and you do not have to share a single one of them with a family member that you removed from your life due to the mental harm and trauma they caused you.  Your parents are discounting the negative impact that this family member they are bringing into the house has caused you and trying to guilt you into just accepting it without considering how it makes you feel or how it may set you back in your mental health recovery.  The fact that all this happened under their roof and they did not act on it then and now look to bring you all under the same roof again tells me that you need to get out from that house if you can.  Your mental health recovery will never fully reach the levels it possibly could while you live there.  Set explicit boundaries with regards to your personal belongings and get out at your earliest availability.  The attitude from your parents almost makes it sound like they want you to move out and are bringing in your sister and giving her children your room as a way to do it without speaking to you about it.", "NTA - OP, this sounds like letting Jeffrey Dahmer and a host of plague vectors invade, but since it's your folks' turf and it doesn't sound like they ever cared a flip about how she abused you, I don't think you're going to get much protection here.  Is there any way you can put a deadbolt on your door and then go stay with a friend until your sister and her spawn have left again?  Or, if they won't let you lock the room (which I suspect they won't) put everything you remotely care about into boxes and take it with you?  Maybe you have a couple of friends who would be willing to each take a box or two.  I think you need to plan on being given no consideration for either your space or your things and take as many protective measures as you possibly can.  Best of luck to you and I hope you can move out soon because it doesn't sound like your situation was ideal even before this planned invasion.", "NTA. But, this is not your decision to make.
