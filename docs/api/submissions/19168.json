{"id": 19168, "submission_id": "142zosc", "title": "AITA for leaving my husband at home, while I spend the week at my brothers, because of how he \u201cbuys\u201d groceries?", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been in a committed relationship with my husband for 17 years, and overall, things have been great. We\u2019ve had a few rough patches, but what\u2019s important to note is that while he earns more than me and is considered the main provider, I have a substantial trust fund that ensures we\u2019re financially stable. I work part-time as a teacher while attending university, earning less than him, and most of my income goes towards tuition. Our household income exceeds $200k annually, while the average in our area is below $50k.\n\nOne ongoing issue we have is my husband\u2019s frugality. He likes to control my spending and have the final say on how he uses his earnings. It\u2019s worth mentioning that I\u2019ve never used any of his income and have no intention to do so.\n\nHowever, the main point of contention between us is his frequent visits to food banks. Despite having more than enough food at home, he insists on going to food banks to save money. He intentionally looks disheveled and uses our beat-up car to blend in, even though he\u2019s never experienced food scarcity. I\u2019ve explained to him the need for food donations in our community, even showing him social media posts from local food banks, but he remains indifferent. I suggested he volunteer or donate to gain firsthand experience, but he refuses. The unfortunate part is that since we\u2019re never short on food, most of what he brings home ends up getting thrown away.\n\nToday, I discovered our fridge filled with fresh produce and meat that clearly didn\u2019t come from our regular grocery store. When I confronted him, he admitted to going to a food bank after seeing a Facebook post about a donation of fresh food. People on social media were already asking if any was left, and there wasn\u2019t. I showed him these comments, but he brushed them off, claiming people should have gone earlier. Exhausted by the situation, I packed a bag and went to stay with my brother for the weekend, asking for space to think things over.\n\nMy husband accuses me of overreacting, being vindictive, and threatens to go back to the food banks regardless of my feelings. His family is also messaging me, calling me an asshole and urging me to stop interfering with his choices. I turned off my phone, but now they\u2019re bombarding my brother with messages. Thankfully, he supports my decision and ignores them.\n\nAll I want is to enjoy the rest of my week without being angry at my husband. Yes, I could let this go and not scold him, but the food he takes could have gone to people who truly need it. I\u2019m not leaving my husband, but I need a few days away to gain some clarity. Am I wrong for wanting this space?", "created_utc": 1686101860, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142zosc/aita_for_leaving_my_husband_at_home_while_i_spend/", "score": 937, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is completely unhinged. A man making 200k while married to a woman with a trust fund going to a food bank is unacceptable.

I would want permanent space", "girl, why the fuck have you spent close to two decades with someone who tries to control your spending and literally steals from people who can\u2019t afford groceries? I don\u2019t care that \u201canyone\u201d can go to the food bank. if you\u2019re bringing home 200k a year and get your groceries from a food bank, you\u2019re stealing food from people who need the charity. \n\nNTA and please oh my god divorce him yesterday", "NTA that\u2019s fucking gross of him. I wonder in which other ways he\u2019s an inconsiderate, selfish ass because I do not believe this is the only example", "I cannot conceive the level of entitlement here. That food is designated for people who literally cannot afford to fill their bellies and the bellies of their families. My family needed those donations when I was young, and as soon as my parents started doing well financially they started giving back as much as possible. It makes me sick to think of someone dressing in dirty clothes and conning food out of the bellies of people that genuinely need it. YOU ARE MARRIED TO A CON MAN. How does he not see how disgusting this is? \n\nI am seriously concerned that his response to you trying to reason with him is to say he's going to go to MORE food banks. What a vindictive and gross response, considering you have thrown food away due to having too much. My response would be: \"fine, you're doing this to save money? For every food bank you visit I will go to the grocery store and spend no less than $500 on groceries which I will immediately donate to food banks. Since you don't care about my opinion on your saving habits, you will have no say on how I spend either.\" \n\nFuck that dude. NTA", "NTA but your husband sure is!!\n\nPlease visit every food bank within driving distance with a photo of your husband (looking disheveled) and tell them that he is nowhere near the poverty line OR living paycheque to paycheque and is just being a selfish tight ass taking food out of the mouths of people that truely need it.\n\nPersonally I would not be able to condone this behaviour in any shape or form AND would absolutely make it a hill to die on.", "NTA X1000. Your husband is stealing from people that are less fortunate. I\u2019m frugal, too, and I like to save money where I can. I use coupons, buy store brand vs name brand for some products, etc. What your husband is doing isn\u2019t frugality, it\u2019s being a shitty person.\n\nI would go to the food bank with his photo and speak to the person in charge. Tell them you\u2019re very sorry your husband has been coming, but you want to let them know he is *not* in need of a food bank. If possible, I\u2019d offer to make a charitable donation to cover the food he has taken from them. I don\u2019t know if they can outright refuse him or not, but it\u2019s worth a shot. They should be aware. \n\nFor you: you say he likes to control how you spend money. He sounds financially abusive. Please consider making that week away from him permanent.\n\nETA: do you have access to his finances? This may be an overreaction, but I\u2019d be worried he\u2019s committing welfare fraud, as well.", "NTA. This isn't frugality, it's literally taking from those who are less fortunate. He knows its wrong because he intentionally tries to look poorer to sell the con, he just doesn't give a shit. The dude sucks, and his family sucks too.

I don't even have any words for how terrible your husband is for doing that.

A lot of big issues there!\n\nMy mother in law notoriously cries poor while having money in investments and savings. She goes to many different places to get her fill of donations, kind words, free coffee or dinner dates, etc. *Always* needs to \"raise funds\" when an unexpected expense comes up..\nShe also uses the foodbank, especially at Christmas time, and will let things go off or will say \"I don't know what I'm going to do with all this food!!!\" No. Just no. That doesn't make for a good character and is quite a serious flaw.\n\nMy point is that she's over 60 now and is alone. She has a lot of acquaintances and several kids who don't respect her. Your husband needs to get over himself and think of others if he wants to maintain genuine meaningful relationships in his life - especially with his wife.\n\nBest of luck!", "This pay period I came as close as I\u2019ve ever come to having no money in my checking account. My partner is struggling to find a job and we are dead-ass broke, and I still don\u2019t consider myself broke enough to take food from people who have less. \n\nTaking time away to clear your head is a mature way to handle things.

I could not be around people who take advantage of the less fortunate.", "Nta.  Your husband is stealing from the poor....", "NTA OP, I suspect your husband may need therapy to get at the underlying reasons he feels a need to exploit resources meant for the poor.

And from the sounds of it, you feel it\u2019s not just a little white-lie misdemeanour type thing. \n\nTo me, looking at someone who will literally take food from the mouths of those who cannot afford it when he himself is comparatively much better off, that\u2019s a difference in values/ethics that would be a dealbreaker on a relationship.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s taking resources from people who need it.

We\u2019ve had a few rough patches, but what\u2019s important to note is that while he earns more than me and is considered the main provider, I have a substantial trust fund that ensures we\u2019re financially stable. I work part-time as a teacher while attending university, earning less than him, and most of my income goes towards tuition. Our household income exceeds $200k annually, while the average in our area is below $50k.\n\nOne ongoing issue we have is my husband\u2019s frugality. He likes to control my spending and have the final say on how he uses his earnings. It\u2019s worth mentioning that I\u2019ve never used any of his income and have no intention to do so.\n\nHowever, the main point of contention between us is his frequent visits to food banks. Despite having more than enough food at home, he insists on going to food banks to save money. He intentionally looks disheveled and uses our beat-up car to blend in, even though he\u2019s never experienced food scarcity. I\u2019ve explained to him the need for food donations in our community, even showing him social media posts from local food banks, but he remains indifferent. I suggested he volunteer or donate to gain firsthand experience, but he refuses. The unfortunate part is that since we\u2019re never short on food, most of what he brings home ends up getting thrown away.\n\nToday, I discovered our fridge filled with fresh produce and meat that clearly didn\u2019t come from our regular grocery store. When I confronted him, he admitted to going to a food bank after seeing a Facebook post about a donation of fresh food. People on social media were already asking if any was left, and there wasn\u2019t. I showed him these comments, but he brushed them off, claiming people should have gone earlier. Exhausted by the situation, I packed a bag and went to stay with my brother for the weekend, asking for space to think things over.\n\nMy husband accuses me of overreacting, being vindictive, and threatens to go back to the food banks regardless of my feelings. His family is also messaging me, calling me an asshole and urging me to stop interfering with his choices. I turned off my phone, but now they\u2019re bombarding my brother with messages. Thankfully, he supports my decision and ignores them.\n\nAll I want is to enjoy the rest of my week without being angry at my husband. Yes, I could let this go and not scold him, but the food he takes could have gone to people who truly need it. I\u2019m not leaving my husband, but I need a few days away to gain some clarity. Am I wrong for wanting this space?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We have all of this to give away! Let him see people in need. Whether it's fear from a poor childhood, or the thrill of doing something he shouldn't, he's doing it for a reason, and he will probably do something else to replace it if he stops this. Maybe it's just easy. But as someone who regularly runs out of milk, eggs, handsoap and regular stuff I should be able to afford, I am in a low income bracket and I only go a few times per year because I feel bad. \nLast night i drove to our local \"blessings box\" at a church nearby (at 1am so as not to be conspicuous)  and grabbed things like hand soap, cereal, tuna, stuff we really needed and I felt so relieved that it was there. \nI think if you gave away or donated all of the groceries and made him replace them with new ones from his own special savings, he would have to rethink things. It could be a new house rule, if you get food pantry food, I'll donate all of our food and you must replace without going to another pantry. I'm guessing he's got other quirks.

Hopefully it\u2019ll take away that high he\u2019s getting off on and deters him from taking advantage of the system.\n\nEdit: oh - maybe another thing to consider is reaching out to the food banks that he frequents at and actually informing him of his fraudulent behaviour.
