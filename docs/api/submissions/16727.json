You don\u2019t get to declare the living room a place where other people cannot make noise. \n\nThis joker isn\u2019t the king of the pizzeria. NTA.", "God Christ no NTA. \n\nWhy do some people with kids become so entitled? \n\nYou're allowed to talk in a public place. I assume you weren't talking above the local volume decibels allowed and it wasn't after 11pm anyways. \n\nIf he wanted his baby to sleep he should have chosen a better time to go for lunch. Besides babies should get used to sleeping through noise, particularly throughout the day when people make noise. \n\nWhat exactly made it ok for him to scream at you but not ok for you to have a conversation with your family anyway?", "NTA - so long as you werent screaming or something, the baby sleeping isnt your problem", "NTA. He literally *screamed* at you for being *too loud*? Sounds like the baby isn\u2019t the only one who needs sleep", "Lol NTA, that man seems to have confused his child\u2019s nursery with a Boston Pizza. I hope he finds his way home soon.", "NTA - even if the baby woke up, that's on the parents.  You don't to control and inconvenience others just because you brought your kid to a pizza place.", "NTA. If his screaming at you didn't wake the baby, then you're talking wasn't going to either. It's a restaurant, there's going to be noise. If he was worried about the baby, he could have removed them from the situation rather than yelling at strangers.", "NTA, nope, no way. \n\nEven if you were loud, it's a restaurant, you were having fun. If the lil' spawn is so delicate that it can't be awakened from it's nappy nap while in a public place, maybe don't take it to a...public place?", "NTA. Pizza joints are usually loud to begin with, and a parent ought to know that when taking a baby there. It isn\u2019t up to complete strangers in a restaurant to ensure his baby gets a nap.\n\nIf he wanted you to talk softly, the right thing would be to humbly and politely ask. I think many people would actually keep their voices down for a stranger\u2019s sleeping baby if asked politely. He acted rude and entitled instead and that makes him T A.", "NTA.  People have no problems with kids screaming at restaurants these days and interrupting everyone, TBH glad to hear the tables turned for once.", "NTA. \n\nYou being loud wasn't okay, but him screaming was acceptable? what a clown of a man.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know just how loud  you were really\n being but don\u2019t bring your new baby to a restaurant if you are worried about the baby being able to sleep. Restaurants are loud even without other patrons being loud. It\u2019s an uncontrollable environment and it is on them as parents to decide what settings are appropriate without expecting strangers to accommodate them.", "NTA as long as you weren't being a nuisance to everyone. A restaurant is not a privileged baby sleeping space.", "Info:  did the baby wake up during this crap fest?", "NTA\n\nA pizza place is not a nursery.", "He yelled because you weren\u2019t quiet? Lol make it make sense! NTA, it\u2019s a public place and expecting everyone to whisper because of your kid is unreasonable and unrealistic. You did nothing wrong.", "Nta, unless you\u2019re obnoxiously loud where you can disturb tables away, then you should be fine. It\u2019s a restaurant not the families house. It\u2019s the same rationale as if the baby just started crying then it wouldn\u2019t be his fault and make him an AH. Restaurants are loud.", "AITA? In no way, fashion or form were you TA. I'm a grandparent, which means that I lived through raising children several times, and at no time would I expect people eating in a restaurant to keep quite so that my child could sleep. I would never go out to eat expecting other people to NOT enjoy their meal to make it easier on me or my wife.", "NTA and how hilarious it is that he got up and screamed while complaining about noise waking the baby LOL.", "Nta yeah cause screaming wasn't going to wake the baby up.  \n\nThey were in a resturant, not the nap center of a day care.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m a parent. When my child was a baby, I knew it was my responsibility to make sure my child was in an environment productive for them. The child\u2019s parents should have removed it from this environment if they wanted the baby to sleep. There is no expectation of quiet at a restaurant & neither you or the other patrons should have had to change your behavior for the rude & entitled parent.", "NTA. You should have offered the baby a slice of pizza, though. Every one is happier after a slice of pizza. LOL", "If you were like screaming loud maybe\u2026..like the kind of volume of that one guy in parks and rec who always shouted talk lol you would be the jerk in general and not just cause of a sleeping baby. However if you just got excited and your voice raised a few octaves then no. My guess is the dad is very sleep deprived and was freaking out cause he got the baby to sleep finally. I think you\u2019re fine. I mean in my case if it happened to me cause I remember when I had the sensitive to noise babies I probably would of cringed and sigh and definitely be dreading my baby waking up but I would of asked the waitress to move my table so I wouldn\u2019t be near the loud table you know?  So not the jerk the guy handled it poorly. Plus I am pretty sure if you hadn\u2019t woke the baby his screaming would have lol", "INFO: Any bad language?\n\nJust loud is ok, but loud and profane is not ok in a family restaurant.", "ESH. He sounds unhinged, but you should probably be more respectful at a restaurant", "God, I hate restaurants that are so loud you can\u2019t hear the server when they come to the table it doesn\u2019t matter if there is a baby sleeping or not.", "INFO: how loud is loud?\n\nIf you can't use your inside voice at a restaurant and are practically shouting to people sitting right next to you you're always the asshole, sleeping baby or no.", "Ehhh.... I'm going to go with an ESH\n\nDude who was screaming about not screaming and also expecting a family pizza place to be a quiet nap center for the baby... that's not reasonable.\n\nBut *in your own words* the four of you were **talking passionately** and **being loud** so I'm going to use my reddit translator and go out on a limb that yeah, you were probably above the line for appropriate restaurant volume too.", "As much as I want to be polite to all the patrons in a shared space, I don't get anyone who thinks a restaurant is a noise free zone that their baby can get a good nap in?\n\nSo, soft YTA if you were at all rowdy. But, NTA if you were briefly boisterous and polite to everyone around you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If this guy's baby needed quiet to sleep, he should take it somewhere else. If no other tables were complaining, you probably weren't any louder than anybody else in that restaurant, you just got sat beside a Kevin who thinks the world revolves around him.", "NTA. Parents like this are just the worst.  You decided to have the baby so you STFU.", "NTA\n\nJust because you have a kid dosen't mean the rest of the world revolves around them too.", "NTA - if you have a baby who needs to sleep the last place you should be is a restaurant.", "NTA If the man didn't want his sleeping baby disturbed he should have stayed home with it or hired a babysitter. I would have gotten louder and yelled at him to take the kid home.", "Dude was out of line. Way out. NTA", "NTA\n\nI have a 3 month old and she easily sleeps through this kind of noise in public. Firstly, the guy should have ensured that the baby is used to napping with noise around during the day. It\u2019s dumb when people don\u2019t do this. You make a rod for your own back by tiptoeing round a baby. \n\nSecondly, if you take a baby to a public place you have to expect noise. It was completely out of line for him to ask you to be quiet. If the baby needs absolute quiet to nap then he should have left.", "NTA. But Y T A  if you didn\u2019t tell him to fuck off or defend yourself in any way. Or the waitress.", "NTA. I\u2019d have said I get you\u2019re tired for having an infant I\u2019ve been there myself. I suggest you take yourself and sleeping baby to the car if you need guaranteed silence. I am going to enjoy my lunch with my friends. At this public establishment.", "NTA. \n\nIf he wanted peace and quiet, he should have stayed home or ordered to-go, you can't expect the world to revolve around you and your kids 24/7, there are going to be loud people, there are going to be mean people, there are going to be things you can't predict/control.", "I wonder what that parent would have did if the baby was in the restaurant crying and bothering all the other guests while they're trying to eat.", "NTA, I guarantee his screaming was more likely to wake up the baby than your conversation. I\u2019m not saying all parents with young children should never go out, but they should know that there\u2019s a big possibility of loud people when you go out in public.", "NTA. Taking a baby to a restaurant and expecting people to be quiet so they can sleep is insane.", "NTA\n\nsounds like that person has some anger issues.", "NTA. Also, don't tiptoe around a sleeping baby.", "NTA this 100 percent. \n\nIt\u2019s their child no one has to make concessions for their child but them. If you want quit and to control the noise stay home.", "Nursery\u2019s are probably louder than a restaurant. This is why you expose babies to noise during the day when they nap so they are used to it and it helps with day/night confusion. My baby easily sleeps right through this kind of noise during the day.", "Also, I'm sure that screaming at someone prevents a baby from sleeping. What an asshole.

A rude entitled one at that.", "The woman who wants a tip?", "I mean, if the guy was literally screaming at you yeah. That doesn't mean you weren't being too loud, just that in that moment you were no longer the worse party between the two of you.", "we'd already paid, we were on our way out", "She wants a tip from Screamy MgGee too, so not sure what point you think you're making.", "Your answer is for the father to be loud as well?
