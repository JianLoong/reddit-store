You didn't even ask your daughter what she wanted. You just decided and ordered. It's her graduation and her dinner / party. You think she doesn't want her full time custodial parent and older sister there? But she does want her half sibling that has no internal control to the point he cannot be in the same room as your daughter's mother ? Sounds like the son that cannot manage his anger and outbursts to the point you find it unsafe potentially to have him be in a room with your ex wife (who he doesn't even have a connection to) is the problem here. This isn't your dinner to brag about what a great kid you (didn't really) raise - its your daughters night. And you went to exclude her mother and her sister (for being close to her mom - that's your issue with her she's close with her mother, wonder why she's not closer to you huh ) because of your immature Ah son? YTA so hard", "YTA. You're not only excluding your ex-wife from a big moment in her daughter's life, you're also denying your daughter the presence of her mother aaand your other daughter ! I mean c'mon, why would you NOT invite one of your daughters because she's closer to your ex? I feel like there's something you're not telling us, because this just sounds weird.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>he can't really be in the same room with her without the potential of losing his cool\n\nThis almost made me change my mind, but you also stated that it's his own internal conflict and the ex-wife is not at fault. So no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I tried explaining that I didn't invite her for her own good\n\nC'mon is this serious?? Please tell us why you're saying you have a cordial relationship and manage to co-parent but you can't stand a reunion with her and ALL your daughters for only one night", "I was fine with everything up to the point where you\u2019re refusing to invite your other daughter because she\u2019s close to her mother. I know plenty of parents who have split and do their own parties etc. so I don\u2019t see a reason your ex can\u2019t throw a party as well. But to not invite your daughter? That\u2019s dirtball and very much makes YTA. Your son also is, because this party isn\u2019t about him, and if you co parent well like you say, there\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t do one big party instead of two. Teach your son to act like an adult, that this isn\u2019t about him, and if anything he shouldn\u2019t be going.", "INFO:  Have you asked your daughter who she wants there? \nShe is  your ex-wife, but she is your daughter's mother, and she should be there if your daughter wants her there.", "YTA.\n\nThe party is being organized for your daughter graduating, so shouldn't it include the people important to her?\n\nYou say yourself that her brother has an irrational anger towards his mother. You should have put it up to him:\n\n_\"This is important to your sister, so your mother is invited. You can either be there and keep your emotions contained, or there's a pizza in the fridge.\"_", "YTA but not because you decided to exclude her, because it seems it was your choice and not your daughter's.\n\nIf it is a party to make her happy you could ask her who she wants here. And the others (your sons included) could \"keep his cool\" for the sake of his sister...  \nAnd if he can't, when the party is not about him, he shoudn't come...", "YTA and you already said why - you\u2019re allowing your son\u2019s shitty behaviour, which is causing your daughter\u2019s mum not to be able to attend her party. This should be about what your daughter wants as the party is to celebrate her - if she doesn\u2019t want her mum there, then that\u2019s fine, but it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s the case.\n\nYou need to teach your son how to control himself, and if he really can\u2019t, then he needs to take himself off somewhere else to cool down. As long as your ex doesn\u2019t do anything actively to wind him up, there\u2019s no reason to exclude her.", "YTA, it's for your daughter graduation, it should be up to her who should be at the party and who shouldn't. If your son has issues with his mom, who you admit has no fault in her sons issues with her, then he should learn some self control and be a supportive brother and probably needs theraphy is he gets so pissed off he can't \"keep his cool\" when it's not the other persons fault. This also applies to inviting your older daughter.", "YTA, this is graduation party for your daughter. Don't you think she would like to have both her parents there?", "YTA for making this about you and not your daughter.", "YTA. All I hear is that you haven\u2019t invited your other daughters because she is \u2018too close\u2019 to your ex (her mum) and you haven\u2019t invited your ex because\u2026. What?? Wait you don\u2019t have a good reason. Your son needs to learn anger management IF as you say your ex is not at fault, but still that isn\u2019t a good enough reason to not invite her.", "YTA. This is your daughter\u2019s party and if she wants her mom there, then mom should be there. Your son can either get over it a behave or not attend.", "Need more information here. If your daughter wants her there you're definitely in the wrong here. It's her grad party and she deserves to have both parents there if she wants them there. In that case her half-brother either stays home or gets to sit in the corner and behave.\n\nHowever if she either doesn't care or doesn't want her mom there, then you accommodating the son is justified.\n\nBased on the fact that your daughter called and informed her mother I'm gonna go with yta for now. Your son's behavior and opinions are not more important than your daughters wishes for her own grad party. Period.", "Sorry, YTA. I think you've probably tried to please the majority but ultimately this is your daughter's party so she gets to determine the guest list. If she wants her Mum there then so be it.", "YTA. You've done that people pleasing thing where you've selected invitees based on what will cause the least drama. Generally that's fine in most instances but this isn't your party, it's your daughter's. So she gets to decide.\n\nI don't quite understand why you didn't invite your other daughter simply cause she's closer to your ex. As for your son; even if his reasons for disliking your ex are valid this event isn't about him. He either needs to behave for the day or decline the invite. Your daughter's wishes take priority here.", "Info why are you punishing one of your daughters for being close to her mother?", "YTA and you know it.  Invite the mom and the sister as well if that is what *the graduate* wants - after all, it's HER party.  If your son can't mind himself for the 2 hours, then he just needs to send regrets.", "This post is messy\u2026one daughter isn\u2019t invited cause she\u2019s closer to your ex. Your ex wife isn\u2019t invited because your son will lose his cool. There so much info missing\u2026", "YTA. You're encouraging and supporting your sons inappropriate behavior. He is not acting like an adult, which you should be putting your foot down about. This is your daughters mom, without her, you wouldn't even have a daughter.", "YTA", "YTA, it\u2019s your daughter\u2019s graduation party, why exactly should her half brother\u2018s inability to behave like an adult dictate who gets an invite? Tbh, why should she even attend a party that\u2019s supposedly thrown for her achievements but excludes her closest family members?", "So Mom is the one who helped your daughter get through school--8 hours away from you--and you don't see why she might deserve to be part of a celebration? Yes, YTA.", "YTA. If this party is for your daughter, she should be the one to decide who's coming and who doesn't. Picking out the guests according to YOUR liking is selfish and wrong. \n\nYou're old enough to keep it together for a day for the sake of your daughter.", "YTA Tell your son to get it together or just stay home. The sun doesn\u2019t rise and set on his head. It is not HIS party, but you\u2019re letting him run the show. Toughen up and invite your daughter\u2019s mother. Invite her sister. do not blame your daughter for being mad and going behind your back. You started it by doing the same thing.", "YTA.. your daughter should invite the people she wants to her graduation and dinner.... not you.... theres no reason her own mom cant be included.... your son is a AH as well... why have her step or half sibling there but not her own mother...", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re excluding your ex from this party because you want to avoid bad behavior from your son. That\u2019s enabling. It\u2019s not your son\u2019s graduation party, you should be inviting people important to your daughter and not your son. I\u2019m guessing your daughter would rather have her mom there than her stepbrother.\n\nAlso seems scummy that you won\u2019t invite your other daughter because \u201cshe\u2019s closer with your ex\u201d. I bet you haven\u2019t told your graduating kid about that.", "NTA You guys are divorced, you are entitled to throw a party and have your own invitee list. If you don't feel it's ideal for her to come then that's your prerogative. She can always host another graduate party for your daughter with her own invitee list.", "NTA. This party is about you not your daughter. You don\u2019t seem to care who she needs there - her mother, her sister both not invited because it makes your life harder.
