You didn't even ask your daughter what she wanted. You just decided and ordered. It's her graduation and her dinner / party. You think she doesn't want her full time custodial parent and older sister there? But she does want her half sibling that has no internal control to the point he cannot be in the same room as your daughter's mother ? Sounds like the son that cannot manage his anger and outbursts to the point you find it unsafe potentially to have him be in a room with your ex wife (who he doesn't even have a connection to) is the problem here. This isn't your dinner to brag about what a great kid you (didn't really) raise - its your daughters night. And you went to exclude her mother and her sister (for being close to her mom - that's your issue with her she's close with her mother, wonder why she's not closer to you huh ) because of your immature Ah son? YTA so hard", "YTA. You're not only excluding your ex-wife from a big moment in her daughter's life, you're also denying your daughter the presence of her mother aaand your other daughter !

I know plenty of parents who have split and do their own parties etc. so I don\u2019t see a reason your ex can\u2019t throw a party as well. But to not invite your daughter? That\u2019s dirtball and very much makes YTA. Your son also is, because this party isn\u2019t about him, and if you co parent well like you say, there\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t do one big party instead of two.

Your son's behavior and opinions are not more important than your daughters wishes for her own grad party. Period.", "Sorry, YTA.

And if she wants both her parents there, put on your big boy pants and play nice for a few hours. And if your son can't do the same then you have failed in raising him properly.\n\nIf my reply sounds harsh, it is because I'm basing my opinion on the info you've provided. If there is backstory you haven't chosen to share, I apologize for the phrasing but not the sentiment.", "You acknowledge that it\u2019s because of your other son, your daughter\u2019s half-brother, who has \u201cinternal conflicts\u201d that are not your ex-wife\u2019s fault that you\u2019re not inviting her - so why is she, the person who isn\u2019t at fault, the one who is being excluded and who has to suffer because your son, who is not the center of the event, can\u2019t control himself? Why aren\u2019t you asking your son to either control himself or excuse himself from the party when he can\u2019t?\n\nYou\u2019re depriving your daughter of her mother\u2019s company during an event celebrating a milestone in her life. You\u2019re making your ex miss a chance to celebrate her own daughter reaching a once-in-her-lifetime milestone. And because that\u2019s not enough, you\u2019re also excluding your daughter\u2019s sister because she\u2019s \u201ctoo close\u201d to your ex. It\u2019s petty and self-centered, putting your son and your comfort over your daughter, making something that should be about your daughter about your son and his hang-ups. \n\nAnd then you had the gall to say disrespectful things to your ex when she was understandably upset about your behaviour. \n\nYTA.", "Ok there is a lot to unpack.\n\nInitially I though this was an issue you and the ex wife. It seem to me that instead of being happy and respectful to each other for the sake of the kids you both use them ( like your other daughter and her husband).  I still have an inkling this is the case.\n\nNow with the information, there is a narrow narrative that you are doing this for your son. I am not sure if this is correct, but I suppose this is a possibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would say this is a lesson for all parents who are splitting to be aware the horrible effect an acrimonious and seeming open dislike can have on the kids. Pitting the kids against their parents and other siblings. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the situation, you should always try and be positive infront of your children.", "YTA\n\nYou are hurting you daughter during her own graduation party to appease your son\u2019s imaginary conflict with your ex-wife. You need to tell HIM he can\u2019t come if he can\u2019t handle it. Not screw over your ex wife & daughter.", "YTA how about inviting the girls mother and leaving your son out as this is literally not about him", "YTA stop thinking about everyone except your daughter and tell your son as a grown man to zip it so your daughters MOTHER can attend. Smh", "How you can type all that out and not realize YTA completely is beyond me.", ">She doesn't feel like it's fair that she would have to miss out because I'm accommodating to my son (from a different marriage) when this ultimately isn't about him and it's about our daughter who we both love and raised together\n\nAnd she is right. YTA.\n\nAnd invite your other daughter. Whether she shows up or not is her business, but not inviting her is just an AH thing to do and is going to lead to her calling you an AH as well. So save yourself the trouble of making a second topic and just invite:\n\n*your daughter's entire family*\n\nAnd if that means step-son can't behave, then uninvite his ass. \n\nIt is a big affair - for your daughter, not for you. You just get to help her set it up and carry it out like a good parent. You don't get to decide for her who her guests are and who not to invite, like an overbearing parent.", "Personal anecdote here,\nWhen I graduated high school, my family went out to dinner. My mom was invited, and refused because she didn\u2019t wanna eat with my father. It has been 8 years since then, and I resent her for not valuing me enough to sit through a dinner celebrating my big achievement. It\u2019s one of my defining memories of her. I imagine your daughter would be really hurt that her family couldn\u2019t get their shit together for her. It might really change her opinion of you, and make her think your son is more important than her. YTA. tell your son to suck it up. It\u2019s not his day.", "NTA. You're divorced, it goes without saying that she will not be invited to parties thrown by your side of the family. If she wants to celebrate, she can do it on her own time and dime", "I see why you\u2019re an ex, OP. YTA and so is your son.", "INFO: would your daughter prefer her half brother there over her mother and sister?  \n\nIf not you are the AH.", "So, really, it's just your son who has issues. That's the one who really shouldn't be invited at all then. YTA", "NTA. Mom can plan her own party. This is so weird.", "The more I think about this, the more it seems that OP used his son as a scapegoat to not allow his ex and a daughter who is close with ex into the party. If the real reason was actually his son's dislike toward the ex, there is no reason for him to not invite his other daughter.", "This guy isn\u2019t asking whether he is the A H, he knows he is.  He is looking for someone to tell him that this is ok, and that it won\u2019t yet his family further apart.  Unfortunately, this will be an utter disaster.   \n\nOP, get over yourself, tell your son to get over himself and the both of you act like adults for one freaking day.  You need to apologize to your ex wife and your other daughter and invite them, before your graduating daughter decides to skip the whole thing.  YTA.  \n\nAre you trying to get your daughters to never talk to you again?  I honestly can\u2019t believe that your graduating daughter hasn\u2019t told you to cancel the whole thing.  As a father, I just can\u2019t imagine putting my own hurt feeling before my child on such a big day.  Is this really the kind of person you want to be?  Is this the example you want to teach your children?", "Agreed YTA OP", "What gets me more is that OP's ex-wife and his son are completely unrelated. And OP claims that his ex did nothing wrong towards his son. This whole scenario smells really fishy", "Except the ex isn't demanding to be his friend. She lives 8 hours away. Her daughter is having a graduation party and will also like her mother there. What is the big deal in witnessing her daughter's party and going back...8 hours away?", "And you're acting against her interests because...?", "100% this.  The party is not for your son."]}
