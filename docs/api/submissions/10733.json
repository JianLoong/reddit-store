She visits us almost everyday, isn't shy to tell us how much she loves us or how much she missed us. she also helps us like washing the dishes whenever she visits. She is going to turn 16 in a few days and we wanted to do something for her to thank her. We decided to give her 3000 dollars to help her buy a car. \n\nMy son(Carl's father) and DIL were visiting a few days ago. We were discussing Nora's birthday and he asked what we are planning to give her. I was honest with him and told him the truth. He got extremely mad and sid this is not fair as we gave Carl 1000 dollars for his 16th birthday. I explained to him that this is because Nora has been helping a lot so this is to thank her and I'm not trying to favor her. My DIL called us assholes and said Nora has been mean to Carl (she could be a bit mean and sarcastic sometimes) and we shouldn't be rewarding her behavior. I told her this has nothing to do with Carl but she insisted that we are showing favoritism and Carl \"desrves a better gift as he is a better person\" and we are \"enabling\" Nora", "created_utc": 1677176753, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11a4t1c/aita_for_favoring_one_of_my_grandchildren/", "score": 460, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But giving her birthday money 3x more than her brother is blatant favoritism. \n\nI grew up with a grandmother who did this. I was the favorite, and it put me in a horribly uncomfortable position with my sibling. As an adult, my grandmother had high expectations of me caring for and helping her, so it became a burden as well.", "NTA- Life is not fair. You will get treated differently than everyone else in all of your endeavors and it is partially based on how much you are liked as an induvial.

It's damaging for children to be compared and treated differently by their family. \n\nDoing the dishes occasionally is **not** worth 2K. If it was really a reward for \"helping\" then you should have kept it separate from her birthday. But it's just a set of grandparents treating one grandchild as lesser than his cousin.

My grandma helped me out tremendously during medical school and I never told my parents or my siblings, it\u2019s none of their business.", "YTA\nYou say that Carl is polite and kind, two character traits that will serve him well in the future, and that some  adults can only wish the kids in the family develop.\n\nYou say that he barely interacts with you, but maybe you need to step back and think why.\n\nKids that are shy are often very observant. They can become skilled at reading one\u2019s body language. I believe you when you say you love him dearly, but at 16, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s seen how you treat Nora. It might even be something you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re doing at the time, but it was probably noticed. It takes many more positive interactions with a kid, to overcome one negative interaction.

Why would you even tell them the amount?  If you had just said money, that should have been the end of the conversation.  Now, look at this mess.  Carl's parents shouldn't be demanding more money because 1k is a lot, in my opinion, to give someone for their birthday, but I can see why they're hurt.

I don\u2019t think you are intentionally favoring one grandchild over the other, I just think you are so clueless over how to handle the thank you gift that you are inadvertently favoring one over the other. As some others have mentioned the best way to handle it is either paying her for her help or simply giving her 2000  some time after her birthday, so it doesn\u2019t get associated as a birthday gift.", "As the \"not favorite\" grandchild YTA.

By publicly giving your grandkids such different gifts you\u2019re clearly trying to make a point.It also seems like favoritism kinda runs in the family based on how DIL refers to her son as the be the \u201cbetter person.\u201d The solution to avoid all this drama is to give the kids the same birthday gift. Then you can give them some allowance through the year when they help you around the house. Also, stop bragging about one grandkid to the other and comparing them. It just shows the accusations of favoritism are correct.", "YTA\n\nMy grand parents would pull this exact thing with me and my siblings. Different amounts for birthday/ Xmas gifts based on how much we talked/ did for them. All it accomplished is hurt feelings and resentment between me and my siblings. Birthdays and Xmas are not times for favoritism ever. That's how you destroy relationships between siblings/ cousins. At this point only one out of the four of us even talk to them anymore. Simply because it became clear that our relationship was transactional to them.  If you continue treating your grandchildren like this there is a good chance you'll lose your grandson all together. Be better for the sake of your family. If you want to pay your granddaughter for helping you out around the house do it literally any other time. Do not add to her birthday money and expect your son and DIL not to call you out for clear favoritism.", "YTA. Carl is being punished for being quiet and kind while Nora is being rewarded for being, in your own words, \"the opposite of Carl.\" The opposite of quiet and kind is loud and mean.

As I commented on another comment ITT: \n\n\n...He got a thousand dollars. People in this thread are ungrateful and a perfect example of how everyone thinks they should get a participation trophy. \n\nMy grandparents gave my cousin a basically free ride to college and I got smaller sums when I was in need, but it wasn't nearly the same amount. I was still grateful for the gifts and help at all, as I was not around as much as my cousin was.\nLife isn't always even or equal and you can do as you pleases with your money. If Carl is upset, he seems ungrateful. It's not like you ignored his birthday entirely. The granddaughter has gotten much closer to you in spending time and energy with her grandparents. \n\nWould it seem unusual to give a friend you see once a year a $20 case of beer on their birthday, and get your best friend something more extravagant; and the guy you see once per year gets upset that you didn't throw him a big party or get him a big gift \"because you got your other friend a better gift?\" You build relationships with people and gift them accordingly. \n\nJust because someone is family doesn't automatically entitle them to your money.\n\n\nEDIT: I'd like to add that if Carl and Nora spent the same amount of time with you and made equal efforts to be around and help out, then you would be the a-hole.", "Oh, look.  Someone favoring an extrovert.  Shocking.  /s\n\nAlso, maybe Carl isn't as close to you because you minimize his bully's behavior?\n\nWhatever.   It's your money.

Because my dad was in the military we never lived close to his father while my other cousins lived basically in the same town.

Nora can't be described as polite or kind but she's the sweetest girl ever?  She can be a bit mean and sarcastic?  Does she have multiple personalities or something?  If you want to compensate her for ACTUAL work done, then do so; otherwise, her birthday present should be on par with the one you gave Carl.", "YTA. If you want to reward her for doing extra work, you should do that separately. Birthday gifts are not for rewards; they're an opportunity to express your love for someone. You've set this up so that your grandson would be entirely justified in assuming you value your granddaughter three times as much as him.", "ESH except the kids. Carl's parents shouldn't be demanding a better gift, but it's obnoxious to give very different sums of money to grandkids who are close in age and admittedly good kids overall. If you want to reward Nora for helping you, you could pay her for stuff like washing your dishes. But I'd be very hurt if I was Carl and found out you gave my cousin who's mean to me 3X more money for birthdays.", "YTA. While you have the right to spend your money however you want, this is basically guaranteed to cause resentment and friction between Carl and Nora, between your own kids, and potentially even Carl and you. You could easily give them the same amount for a birthday present, and then, at another separate time, give Nora something to thank her for the help. It may seem like semantics, but it will be perceived as far more fair than what you're doing now. \n\nThe problem is that I think you want the inequality to be noticed, because you want to reward Nora and punish/incentivize Carl. And this is absolutely not going to work the way you're hoping it will.", "I think it is a crappy thing to do, especially because it will cause resentment and division in the family, but your money, your choice.\n\nThe fact that you so blatantly announced this with no insight into how hurtful your favoritism would be, is really messed up. How are you this unaware? The doing chores seems to be a justification after the fact than a well thought out reason.\n\nDespite all of this it is your money, but you could have gone about it in a more subtle and kinder way. Blatant favoritism sucks. Soft yta", "NTA. Honestly, yes, you are favoring one of them. But, they're your GRANDchildren, not your children. Considering one of them is spending a shit-ton of time with you and helping you out around the house, you favoring that one makes sense to me. If your son wants Carl to have another $2k, he can give it to him.", "Hold on.\n\nYour son said just straight up about his teenage kids, \"my son is a better person than my daughter\" and he's accusing /you/ of favoritism?\n\nIs he capable of critical thinking or did that lesson not make it in while you were raising him?\n\nNTA, but... where did he learn to think like that?", "YTA - this isn't \"favoring\" this is FAVORING.  It's not Carl's fault that he is quiet and shy.", "Info: do you care how this might make Carl feel?  Have you tried to reach out to him to talk about this?", "YTA.\n\nYou have the right to give any gift you want; **however**, that does not make you any less of an AH for clearly favoring your granddaughter over your grandson.\n\nIf you want to \"reward\" Nora for helping out, then you can give her something small ($25, a Starbucks gift card, etc.), every now an then.  In that case, it is clear that it is because she helped you.  But giving her $2,000 more than you gave Carl for a birthday gift is not okay.\n\nEdit: Typo", "Yta. If you want to pay her for helping you, that should be outside her birthday.   Sounds like you just like her more and are trying to justify giving her 3 times the amount you are giving your grandson.", "YTA\n\nThis is blatant favoritism you can dress it up however you like but it's clear you like her more.\n\nShe's getting triple the gift of your grandson despite her being cruel to her cousin and you even saying she's not polite or kind. \n\nRewarding someone mean just because they aren't mean to you is still rewarding someone mean and honestly giving her even more ammunition to be mean to her cousin.", "If you want to thank your granddaughter for helping out then you should start an allowance for her and offer the exact same thing to your grandson so he feels welcome to visit and help out too. That being said, you should probably keep that separate from the gift and give her the same you gave your grandson. \n\nIf you can bring it up in a way that wouldn't push your granddaughter away, talk to her about her relationship with her brother and make sure she isn't bullying him, since their parents brought it up. It might just turn out that your grandson isn't visiting as often or helping out because she is there and he doesn't want to be treated poorly by her. Or maybe your grandson feels you favoritize her too and that's why. I know your actions seem fair to you but I doubt their parents would've been this upset about a generous gift if favoritism wasn't involved. \n\nAll that being said, YTA for caring more about suprising your granddaughter with a big gift than everything else mentioned. The gift will be a short term happy, the investment in treating your grandkids equally and fostering a healthy relationship among all family members will lead to long term happiness.", "NTA. But, maybe consider giving her the same birthday gift that you gave him, and separately give an additional amount as  a Thank You for the help.", "YTA\n\nThis is tremendously unfair to Carl, and it communicates that you show love through monetary favoritism. \n\nAlso very telling that Nora's parents say she has behavior issues, and you yourself say you cannot describe her as polite or kind, but I guess she washed some dishes so she gets a car?", "YTA Your grandson isn't as outgoing. He makes up in kindness what he lacks in assertiveness. It would be different if their personalities were also switched. She does help you and so help her in the same type of ways but not financially making a difference between the two. I believe making such a big difference could hurt Carl and push him further away.", "YTA.\n\nSo you play favorites and then get offended when you're being told you're playing favorites. It doesn't take a genius to know that gifting in massively disproportionate ways is going to make it clear who you favor. \n\nAnyone saying it's your money so it's ok to play favorites is clearly missing the bigger picture. Obligation, or a lack of, doesn't mean you're not an asshole. Playing favorites is harmful.", "NTA \n\nPeople need to stop acting like wanting something is the same as deserving something. You got a gift for Carl that is proportionate to your relationship with him. Nora is getting a gift that is proportionate to your relationship with her. It seems you two have a better relationship bc Nora is making a greater effort than him. No one here is doing anything out of resentment. \n\nSome people are projecting their own relationship onto yours. \n\nAlso, Carl\u2019s parents basically said that Nora is inferior to Carl.", "NTA!

It would be unfair to her to give them the same gifts because she\u2019s putting in a lot more effort to be in your lives.", "NTA\n\nIt logically follows that if one of your grandchildren is going above and beyond to help you guys out, and visits frequently that she would be closer with her grandparents, and sometimes even this means getting nicer gifts than other grandchildren. \n\nAlso, Carl got $1000 for his 16th birthday which is a HUGE gift and nothing to scoff at. Carl's father should be thankful that you guys are giving such great blessings to his kids to help them afford to have a vehicle, or save for schooling or rent or what have you. \n\nYour son is being a bit entitled, and while maybe Nora is being rude to Carl at home, your gift isn't incentivizing that since thats out of your control.", "NTA.  You can do whatever you want with your money.  It sounds like you are rewarding Nora for visiting every day and doing chores.  There's nothing wrong with that.  If you want to even things out, then make it clear to your son that you will give your grandson a similar reward if HE visits more frequently and does chores.  Then see what happens.  I wouldn't be surprised if there is some feeling that grandson shouldn't have to do 'womens work' like chores to get rewarded....\nYour DIL is an AH though, to call Carl a 'better person!'", "Maybe show you gratitude along the way instead? Big birthday gifts should be fair...it causes so much resentment and bitterness when they're not.\n\nYTA.", "YTA, my grandpa did this and he died with neither me nor my cousins around. Even the one he favored (as in: bought her a HORSE, her stocking was always filled with clearly more expensive item, bdays she got more money in the envelope so it was damn apparent) wanted nothing to do with him by the end. She was Nora- always helpful and there the most. My little sister was Carl. He told her \u201cart isn\u2019t a real career\u201d when she said she wanted to paint at 5 (but the favored cousin got art supplies for several years and a private studio in their attic).

You\u2019re not their parents.

I wouldn\u2019t personally do that. \n\nBut I really dislike that your present to the granddaughter you\u2019re very close with is seen as a referendum on Carl who *deserves* more money because Nora\u2019s been rude to him in the past? Grandparents can\u2019t shower grandkids with presents and affection for fear of enabling them?", "NTA\n\nWhat you do with your money is your business. You do not owe them an explanation. They shouldn't have asked.  \n\nThis aside, you say you don't interact with Carl often. Is he really nicer and more polite or do you just not know him as well? Is there a reason Nora has been mean to Carl? What did being mean to Carl entail? If the cousins don't get along, that's between them.", "YTA: You state \"He is also a very quiet and shy and barely interacts with us.\" You mention nothing about making one bit of effort to meet that young man where he is as a person, to get to know him, and to interact with him. Say, a puzzle, or reading books, or whatever is quiet. Thus you've created the inequity in the relationship, and now you're rewarding the inequity which you've created.  \n\nAlso - remember - as minors - that money isn't really under their control.

He is also a very quiet and shy and barely interacts with us.\n\nNora however is the opposite of Carl. I can never describe her as polite and kind however she is the sweetest girl I've ever met. She visits us almost everyday, isn't shy to tell us how much she loves us or how much she missed us. she also helps us like washing the dishes whenever she visits. She is going to turn 16 in a few days and we wanted to do something for her to thank her. We decided to give her 3000 dollars to help her buy a car. \n\nMy son(Carl's father) and DIL were visiting a few days ago. We were discussing Nora's birthday and he asked what we are planning to give her. I was honest with him and told him the truth. He got extremely mad and sid this is not fair as we gave Carl 1000 dollars for his 16th birthday. I explained to him that this is because Nora has been helping a lot so this is to thank her and I'm not trying to favor her. My DIL called us assholes and said Nora has been mean to Carl (she could be a bit mean and sarcastic sometimes) and we shouldn't be rewarding her behavior. I told her this has nothing to do with Carl but she insisted that we are showing favoritism and Carl \"desrves a better gift as he is a better person\" and we are \"enabling\" Nora\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Since Nora is the opposite of Carl I doubt she will be there when you need her and she will rather hangout with friends. YTA!", "NTA however you can go about it in a much better way in my opinion. Whenever my sister and I go visit my grandmother she gives us money for \u201cgas\u201d and \u201cdinner\u201d, not totally useless since we live about an hour away. This means I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve received quite a bit more than our cousins who live farther away as adults (youngest is my sister at 24 years old right now). So instead of giving her a larger birthday gift give her money for visiting in the form of gas or dinner or chore money. Depending on your overall feelings of the situation you can tell her that you\u2019d prefer she kept it quiet (not lying to her parents {instead saying oh grandma gave me some money for snacks but not explicitly volunteering how much money} but not going home and bragging about it and waving money around) or tell both grandkids the new deal (visiting for money) and maybe your grandson will try to have a better relationship with you.", "YTA\n\nGot some lived-in experience with stuff like this. It's why none of my cousins and I talk. Turns out when you're the favorite grandson, the rest of the family just resents you. \n\nIf you want to reward Nora for the help she gives, that's your prerogative. But understand that there's smarter ways of doing it. My grandad used to tip me \"gas money\" when I'd make the drive to come see him. But he never would've flat given me thousands of dollars like that, because he knew that would make a rift in his family (of course, it happened anyways).\n\nAlso, your grandson might have social anxiety or similar, making normal social interaction difficult for him. This might shock you, but that can manifest young. Maybe help him come out of his shell with positive engagement and taking the initiative?\n\nAll in all, you're priming your family for conflict. Might seem minor to you, but my grandad thought the same thing, and now he's alone with alzheimers with both halves of the family too resentful of each other to ever be whole again.", "You obviously know that giving one grandchild more money than another is going to create drama. So it seems you are using this as a way to have a dig that Carl doesn't see you enough. YTA", "It\u2019s a bad look.", "Based on what you wrote: ESH\n\nBased on my gut: YTA\n\nI feel like, as with many of these posts, information is missing. Whether it\u2019s true or not, I find it hard to believe that your DIL said what you relayed to us word for word. Based on how you tiptoed around describing Nora, your side of the story has some holes.\n\nFor example, if Carl is polite and kind and Nora is opposite of him\u2026 describing her as the \u201csweetest\u201d girl you\u2019ve ever met seems like favoritism without a willingness to admit it. Openly paying your grandkids a gift that has a $2000 difference between the two sends a message - whether you like it or not and whether you believe it or not - that Nora is your favorite. Just by \u201cdoing dishes\u201d or being helpful, this does not merit a $3000 gift. For this reason, my gut says YTA\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s your money and you can do whatever you want with it. If you don\u2019t mind paying Nora in a manner that makes her appear the favorite, then that is your choice. Similarly, if what you claim your DIL said is true, then that is terrible from a parental standpoint. That would make your DIL an AH, too. This is why I say ESH. Pretty crappy to display what is clearly ignorant favoritism and equally crappy for your DIL to say that about Nora.\n\nI just want you to understand that, while your money is your money, Carl may see it as favoritism himself and feel less loved. This could cause resentment. Or it might not as I don\u2019t know your grandkids and am just an outside observer on the other side of the screen.", "I was the favored grandchild and I am going to say NTA.

I cooked, cleaned, drove him to the dr, hung out with him and cared for his medical needs. Because of this we had a close relationship. When he died we discovered that he left me a small amount of money. My sibling and cousins did not get anything. I never asked him to leave me anything and I did not help him because I was looking for an inheritance. I was there for him because I was available and that is what family does. My grandpa felt that my kindness was enough to warrant a little something upon his passing. \n\nI strongly believe that everything in life is about relationships.

It also caused conflict with their own kids because no one wants to see their kids treated badly.  By the time my grandparents died, they were permanently estranged from one of their children and her two kids for years.  There was discord between the siblings that never got resolved.  There were hard feelings between cousins that never got resolved.  Basically, the legacy of the choices they made was a fractured extended family that NEVER all were in the same room again voluntarily, even years after they died.  It's not worth it.

He still does and I\u2019m 35+ years old.

Bit of a chicken and the egg issue.", "Maybe he doesn't like being there because it's obvious the think his sibling is better than him.\nOP is YTA.", "From the post it sounds like Nora is an extroverted personality while Carl is more introverted. As a fellow introvert one thing I struggled with is wondering if people actually want me hanging around them. I would often avoid social situations because I thought people would prefer if I wasn't there, especially when it seemed they preferred someone else. I often felt like I was intruding. \n\nI realise this is me projecting my experiences growing up in to this scenario, but it is something to consider when you say Carl didn't spend time with them.", " My grandpa probably had a favorite grand kid, but we were still all treated exactly the same when it came to gifts. $100 on your birthday and $50 for Christmas.", "You can have favorite grandkids - but you can't treat them differently.", "My grandmother says in private that me and my brothers are the better behaved grandchildren but that\u2019s as far as any favouritism goes, in total there\u2019s 8 of us and us 3 are the eldest by a good 5-6 years.

No, you are never ever ever allowed to do anything that lets any grandchild realize this, including the favorite.", "Agree, only parents can't play favourites, grandparents, aunts, uncles etc. can if they want to.", "You label him as kind and polite, and her as the opposite\u2026 but you want other people to be like her? So you want a family of mean and rude people, that just come over and visit more often. This is favoritism because she just happens to be less socially awkward and visits you more. You are rewarding how often she visits, his has nothing to do with behavior. \n\nWhat if the parents had to move cross country and the child couldn\u2019t visit? Would you cut them off or treat them less because they don\u2019t visit?", "If you ever wonder why ppl complain about Boomer parents, it is this crap, right here.", "Lmao, my grandma was just like you.

That\u2019s what you want?", "Carl isn't the one that's upset. It's his parents who are upset that he's not getting the same treatment.

In flabbergasted\n\nEver wondered if she\u2019s got ulterior motives, hmmm?", "Agh and there you go. Lol, wrapped around a 16 yr olds finger cause she plays nice with the old folks. Nice to see its lost on you that she can milk money out of you guys by being nice to you but can bully everyone else huh? Good to see you'll reward shitty behaviour.", "Considering you\u2019re a grandmother you should already know this, but spoiled doesn\u2019t always mean that they\u2019re good for nothing. It means that they behave in such a manner that other people find offensive because they\u2019ve never had consequences. \n\nBy that definition your grand daughter is spoiled.

I am so grateful that my grandmother was not like you.", "I don\u2019t usually tag people on here that is helpful thanks", "I was my Nana's favorite (youngest grandchild and born on her wedding anniversary), the only time it manifested was I might get an extra book or two at my birthday and Christmas and at girl scout cookie time she would order a couple of extra boxes from me (she ordered from everyone).  That was it, nothing major and nothing that would be too noticeable.  If you are going to show favoritism, that is the way to do it.\n\nOh and I got her harlequin romance novel collection (the old ones that are out of print), that was awkward to say the least.", "I get that for kids, but I've never heard that for grandparents/grandkids. And grandchildren definitely get treated differently.", "Tell that to my husband's grandmother.\n\nOh wait, you can't. She's dead.

Of course my husband wasn't even invited (not even if he paid for himself to come).", "Agreed. I was the favored grandchild by one of my grandmothers and even when I was a young kid, I could see how it negatively affected my sister and cousins. My aunt also was not very nice to me at times because I was the favorite and not one of her kids. I am more outgoing than my sister/cousins and I look like my grandma. I didn't choose it and once I realized I was favored, I did everything I could to downplay it so that my family members wouldn't be cold to me. I was never mean to my sister/cousins like OP says her granddaughter is though, that is terrible. If anything, I wished not to be the favorite. It was more in time/talk than in gifts. My grandmother was still very generous with everyone, but she really doted on me a lot and bragged about me to everyone. At family gatherings she would always tell stories about something cute I did, etc. and it made me feel awkward once I understood it.", "Or if there are siblings", "Ha, not even if there are 10, they still compare notes!", "Didn't realize there was a set number where it was alright. You're either allowed to or not, regardless if it is two or ten.", "I'm honestly confused as to how OP can describe her granddaughter as sweet, but not polite or kind.  Like, earnestly, non-sarcastically confused.  To me, someone cannot be sweet without being *at least* kind, if not also polite.", "Shouldn't the fact that Nora helping out without needing to be asked be all the more reason why she gets more? And it's not like OP is making the gap public knowledge to Carl, so it shouldn't even matter to him how much Nora gets.", "This is called a straw man argument and is one of the more commonly known logical fallacies. I am sorry that happened to you but that is not the same as what we're talking about in this post.", "OP hasn't seen any bullying, this is a claim coming from Carl's father who could be making the whole thing up.", "So basically you're saying you wish Nana had shared his bodice rippers with another grandchild, yes?", "Dang what did your husband do to piss her off?", "oh, that sucks.  My partner was the punching bag in her family - the other kids were never treated as badly as she was.  That's an awful feeling to live with.  Give your husband a hug for me, and tell him that this Grandma sends her best to him.", "You may want to spend more time with your grandkids, but if you are deciding that visitation equals how much cash you will give them for birthdays, then yes, you are playing favourites.\n\nIf this is a lesson you want them to learn in the future, they may only choose to visit because they know they will get cash instead of visiting to spend time with you.", "It's playing favorites when you pay one grandchild for visiting more than the other. YTA \u2014 the massive AH \u2014 if you alienate your other grandchild.\n\nIf you want to do something to help them, you can offer to pay them both an equal hourly wage for helping with chores. And don't let one claim all the chores, so the other doesn't have any hope of earning money.", "No, it's playing favorites when you show more love to one than the other because she's there more. And it's a not even necessarily a bad thing to have a favorite, and this is as good a reason to have one as there probably is, but it's still favoritism, and you pretending it isn't is blinding you to real problems in other relationships around you.", "Carl sounds like an introvert. That\u2019s his nature, and you\u2019re favoring the extroverted child. This happens all the freaking time and is so detrimental for quiet kids. \nI was the quiet girl with an extrovert cousin. I too was bullied by her. Guess who got away with it due to her *cute and bubbly personality*?\n\nGod, this brings back so many bad memories. You\u2019re about to do the same to your grandchild. Think long and hard about what you\u2019re about to do. YTA", "If they want to give her more for doing extra work, that's fine. The implication of giving more for her birthday is that Nora's birth (the thing being celebrated by the gift) is 3x more important/special/noteworthy than Carl's.\n\nIf they want to wait a few weeks and then cut her a check for 2 grand for all of the work she does, I doubt anyone would fault that. The amount might be extravagant and it should be open to anyone willing to go put in the same effort as Nora, of course, but that's separate from the birthdays.", "By OP's own admission, Nora gives Carl shit and is prone to being mean. The chances of her keeping this to herself are slim to none. OP has to assume it will come out, and that's going to cause a rift. Hell, it's already causing one. The daughter-in-law may have handled it like shit and is definitely TA as well here, but the answer to OP's question is yes, OP is definitely TA. There are better ways to handle it and OP chose the way that is most likely to cause conflict.", "Thank you!", "Op says herself that she knows she's an AH to everyone except them 2.", "If it's a \"favor\", why are you paying her anything extra at all? You're literally buying her love at this point.", "Then every time she goes around just give her like $20, there are a lot of grandparents who do things like that, if that is too much then give her $10.", "He doesn\u2019t have to be outgoing to visit with them more or to help out.", "That's how my grandma operated too.  I will fully admit that I took advantage of it while we were still in contact.  Cleaned her house, made her food, listened to her stories, and lost a little bit more respect for her with every extra special gift she gave me.", "> By OP's own admission, Nora gives Carl shit and is prone to being mean.\n\nOr the dad is actually making that up to guilt OP, it wouldn't be the first time here I've heard of parents manipulating their children against their grandparents.", "Well she isn't thanking her for being nice to other people lol", "They are cousins according to the OP.", ">your love comes conditionally to time spent.\n\nThis, right here.  Gifting the way OP is makes their love completely conditional.  Grandson doesn't visit or help?  Okay, you only get *this* much.  Granddaughter here all the time? She gets more.  \n\nOP, you are in essence telling your grandchildren what their literal value is to you and you actually believe it's appropriate. Do you really want your grandson to be money-motivated to see you instead of love-motivated?", "Both the granddaughter and grandmother are \"buying\" love at this point. GD is just using time instead of money. There's no way a 16 year old doesn't notice the difference by now. I know I did at her age, my grandmother was the same way.", "Seems like neither has a car to get there, granddaughter relies on a bus, not sure of grandsons situation and because of that, can\u2019t make any judgements on how often he can visit. He could help out more sure, but other comments the grandparent made makes me think there is other factors in play", "So what you are saying is that he needs to earn birthday money?  Sounds like you are also an awesome grandparent. /s", "Why does he have to make the effort? He's 16. If they wanted to see him more they could, ya know visit, make time to do things with him? And why does he need to help out?", "NO ONE IS SAYING HE SHOULD GET A THANK YOU GIFT!!!! Are you being purposely obtuse?", "That's not my logic and you clearly didn't read what I said. If OP wants to give Nora a reasonable allowance (hell, even an unreasonable allowance) for the work she does, that's great. Everyone gets a birthday gift and Nora gets extra money on a weekly basis for coming over to help with chores. Lumping it all in as the birthday gist and saying Nora gets a better gift because she's more helpful is the wrong way to go about it.\n\nI have a sibling that used to go to my grandparents' house once a week to clean and she got paid every week for it. We still got the same amount of money for our birthdays. That arrangement works and prevents resentment.", "True, true.", "Would be weird considering I have no kids (but I do see the /s). Nah, I think the best idea is to give her 1k for her birthday and then \u201crepay\u201d her with the rest.", "He doesn\u2019t need to do anything, neither does the granddaughter. Which is why she\u2019s getting more money. Although I think they should give her 1k for her birthday and then give her the 2K separately for the help she\u2019s given them.", "You laid it out beautifully. I don't get how people like OP cannot see the simple logic here.  Willful ignorance in action.\n\nYou know, eventually Carl is going to figure this out and it will not go well for either Nora or her grandparents, but, perhaps they don't care about having a good relationship with Carl.", "Carl doesn\u2019t have to know, yet it\u2019s been made clear his sister is mean to him. You don\u2019t think she\u2019d shove it in his face? OP, YTA", "They can't go back in time and give her some money weekly so she gets 2k now can they? It's absurd that. Carl should be disturbed about getting 1k - pretty generous gift? It's not like he didn't get anything. He freaking got a grand!\nShe is doing much more to have a relationship with them than him - as simple as that! Nothing stopping him from putting in more time with grandparents.", "Exactly, just cause she does it doesn't mean he has to as well, but if it's conditional that hey you do the dishes and we'll pay you 2k extra on your bday really speaks volumes of these grandparents. That's favouritism, not to mention she glosses over the fact that she bullies Carl.", "So basically she's being paid to be her grandparents' maid and companion.  That's not a family relationship, that's a job.", "It\u2019s his cousin not his sister", "They can do it retroactively. \"Hey, Nora, here's a little something for going above and beyond so often.\"\n\nThe issue is tying it to the birthday gift. The implication is that Nora's birth is more important or worthy of celebration than Carl's birthday.", "Pretty sure by the sounds of it, no that\u2019s not her job.", "Regardless, she\u2019s not going to keep it to herself.", "The implication is they are closer to their granddaughter  than their grandson, because she bothers to be in their life FFS."]}
