She visits us almost everyday, isn't shy to tell us how much she loves us or how much she missed us. she also helps us like washing the dishes whenever she visits. She is going to turn 16 in a few days and we wanted to do something for her to thank her. We decided to give her 3000 dollars to help her buy a car. \n\nMy son(Carl's father) and DIL were visiting a few days ago. We were discussing Nora's birthday and he asked what we are planning to give her. I was honest with him and told him the truth. He got extremely mad and sid this is not fair as we gave Carl 1000 dollars for his 16th birthday. I explained to him that this is because Nora has been helping a lot so this is to thank her and I'm not trying to favor her. My DIL called us assholes and said Nora has been mean to Carl (she could be a bit mean and sarcastic sometimes) and we shouldn't be rewarding her behavior. I told her this has nothing to do with Carl but she insisted that we are showing favoritism and Carl \"desrves a better gift as he is a better person\" and we are \"enabling\" Nora", "created_utc": 1677176753, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11a4t1c/aita_for_favoring_one_of_my_grandchildren/", "score": 958, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But giving her birthday money 3x more than her brother is blatant favoritism. \n\nI grew up with a grandmother who did this. I was the favorite, and it put me in a horribly uncomfortable position with my sibling. As an adult, my grandmother had high expectations of me caring for and helping her, so it became a burden as well.", "NTA- Life is not fair. You will get treated differently than everyone else in all of your endeavors and it is partially based on how much you are liked as an induvial.

It's damaging for children to be compared and treated differently by their family. \n\nDoing the dishes occasionally is **not** worth 2K. If it was really a reward for \"helping\" then you should have kept it separate from her birthday. But it's just a set of grandparents treating one grandchild as lesser than his cousin.

My grandma helped me out tremendously during medical school and I never told my parents or my siblings, it\u2019s none of their business.", "YTA\nYou say that Carl is polite and kind, two character traits that will serve him well in the future, and that some  adults can only wish the kids in the family develop.\n\nYou say that he barely interacts with you, but maybe you need to step back and think why.\n\nKids that are shy are often very observant. They can become skilled at reading one\u2019s body language. I believe you when you say you love him dearly, but at 16, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s seen how you treat Nora. It might even be something you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re doing at the time, but it was probably noticed. It takes many more positive interactions with a kid, to overcome one negative interaction.

Why would you even tell them the amount?  If you had just said money, that should have been the end of the conversation.  Now, look at this mess.  Carl's parents shouldn't be demanding more money because 1k is a lot, in my opinion, to give someone for their birthday, but I can see why they're hurt.

I don\u2019t think you are intentionally favoring one grandchild over the other, I just think you are so clueless over how to handle the thank you gift that you are inadvertently favoring one over the other. As some others have mentioned the best way to handle it is either paying her for her help or simply giving her 2000  some time after her birthday, so it doesn\u2019t get associated as a birthday gift.", "As the \"not favorite\" grandchild YTA.

By publicly giving your grandkids such different gifts you\u2019re clearly trying to make a point.It also seems like favoritism kinda runs in the family based on how DIL refers to her son as the be the \u201cbetter person.\u201d The solution to avoid all this drama is to give the kids the same birthday gift. Then you can give them some allowance through the year when they help you around the house. Also, stop bragging about one grandkid to the other and comparing them. It just shows the accusations of favoritism are correct.", "YTA\n\nMy grand parents would pull this exact thing with me and my siblings. Different amounts for birthday/ Xmas gifts based on how much we talked/ did for them. All it accomplished is hurt feelings and resentment between me and my siblings. Birthdays and Xmas are not times for favoritism ever. That's how you destroy relationships between siblings/ cousins. At this point only one out of the four of us even talk to them anymore. Simply because it became clear that our relationship was transactional to them.  If you continue treating your grandchildren like this there is a good chance you'll lose your grandson all together. Be better for the sake of your family. If you want to pay your granddaughter for helping you out around the house do it literally any other time. Do not add to her birthday money and expect your son and DIL not to call you out for clear favoritism.", "YTA. Carl is being punished for being quiet and kind while Nora is being rewarded for being, in your own words, \"the opposite of Carl.\" The opposite of quiet and kind is loud and mean.

As I commented on another comment ITT: \n\n\n...He got a thousand dollars. People in this thread are ungrateful and a perfect example of how everyone thinks they should get a participation trophy. \n\nMy grandparents gave my cousin a basically free ride to college and I got smaller sums when I was in need, but it wasn't nearly the same amount. I was still grateful for the gifts and help at all, as I was not around as much as my cousin was.\nLife isn't always even or equal and you can do as you pleases with your money. If Carl is upset, he seems ungrateful. It's not like you ignored his birthday entirely. The granddaughter has gotten much closer to you in spending time and energy with her grandparents. \n\nWould it seem unusual to give a friend you see once a year a $20 case of beer on their birthday, and get your best friend something more extravagant; and the guy you see once per year gets upset that you didn't throw him a big party or get him a big gift \"because you got your other friend a better gift?\" You build relationships with people and gift them accordingly. \n\nJust because someone is family doesn't automatically entitle them to your money.\n\n\nEDIT: I'd like to add that if Carl and Nora spent the same amount of time with you and made equal efforts to be around and help out, then you would be the a-hole.", "Oh, look.  Someone favoring an extrovert.  Shocking.  /s\n\nAlso, maybe Carl isn't as close to you because you minimize his bully's behavior?\n\nWhatever.   It's your money.

Because my dad was in the military we never lived close to his father while my other cousins lived basically in the same town.

Nora can't be described as polite or kind but she's the sweetest girl ever?  She can be a bit mean and sarcastic?  Does she have multiple personalities or something?  If you want to compensate her for ACTUAL work done, then do so; otherwise, her birthday present should be on par with the one you gave Carl.", "YTA. If you want to reward her for doing extra work, you should do that separately. Birthday gifts are not for rewards; they're an opportunity to express your love for someone. You've set this up so that your grandson would be entirely justified in assuming you value your granddaughter three times as much as him.", "ESH except the kids. Carl's parents shouldn't be demanding a better gift, but it's obnoxious to give very different sums of money to grandkids who are close in age and admittedly good kids overall. If you want to reward Nora for helping you, you could pay her for stuff like washing your dishes. But I'd be very hurt if I was Carl and found out you gave my cousin who's mean to me 3X more money for birthdays.", "YTA. While you have the right to spend your money however you want, this is basically guaranteed to cause resentment and friction between Carl and Nora, between your own kids, and potentially even Carl and you. You could easily give them the same amount for a birthday present, and then, at another separate time, give Nora something to thank her for the help. It may seem like semantics, but it will be perceived as far more fair than what you're doing now. \n\nThe problem is that I think you want the inequality to be noticed, because you want to reward Nora and punish/incentivize Carl. And this is absolutely not going to work the way you're hoping it will.", "I think it is a crappy thing to do, especially because it will cause resentment and division in the family, but your money, your choice.\n\nThe fact that you so blatantly announced this with no insight into how hurtful your favoritism would be, is really messed up. How are you this unaware? The doing chores seems to be a justification after the fact than a well thought out reason.\n\nDespite all of this it is your money, but you could have gone about it in a more subtle and kinder way. Blatant favoritism sucks. Soft yta", "NTA. Honestly, yes, you are favoring one of them. But, they're your GRANDchildren, not your children. Considering one of them is spending a shit-ton of time with you and helping you out around the house, you favoring that one makes sense to me. If your son wants Carl to have another $2k, he can give it to him.", "Hold on.\n\nYour son said just straight up about his teenage kids, \"my son is a better person than my daughter\" and he's accusing /you/ of favoritism?\n\nIs he capable of critical thinking or did that lesson not make it in while you were raising him?\n\nNTA, but... where did he learn to think like that?", "YTA - this isn't \"favoring\" this is FAVORING.  It's not Carl's fault that he is quiet and shy.", "Info: do you care how this might make Carl feel?  Have you tried to reach out to him to talk about this?", "YTA.\n\nYou have the right to give any gift you want; **however**, that does not make you any less of an AH for clearly favoring your granddaughter over your grandson.\n\nIf you want to \"reward\" Nora for helping out, then you can give her something small ($25, a Starbucks gift card, etc.), every now an then.  In that case, it is clear that it is because she helped you.  But giving her $2,000 more than you gave Carl for a birthday gift is not okay.\n\nEdit: Typo", "Yta. If you want to pay her for helping you, that should be outside her birthday.   Sounds like you just like her more and are trying to justify giving her 3 times the amount you are giving your grandson.", "YTA\n\nThis is blatant favoritism you can dress it up however you like but it's clear you like her more.\n\nShe's getting triple the gift of your grandson despite her being cruel to her cousin and you even saying she's not polite or kind. \n\nRewarding someone mean just because they aren't mean to you is still rewarding someone mean and honestly giving her even more ammunition to be mean to her cousin.", "If you want to thank your granddaughter for helping out then you should start an allowance for her and offer the exact same thing to your grandson so he feels welcome to visit and help out too. That being said, you should probably keep that separate from the gift and give her the same you gave your grandson. \n\nIf you can bring it up in a way that wouldn't push your granddaughter away, talk to her about her relationship with her brother and make sure she isn't bullying him, since their parents brought it up. It might just turn out that your grandson isn't visiting as often or helping out because she is there and he doesn't want to be treated poorly by her. Or maybe your grandson feels you favoritize her too and that's why. I know your actions seem fair to you but I doubt their parents would've been this upset about a generous gift if favoritism wasn't involved. \n\nAll that being said, YTA for caring more about suprising your granddaughter with a big gift than everything else mentioned. The gift will be a short term happy, the investment in treating your grandkids equally and fostering a healthy relationship among all family members will lead to long term happiness.", "NTA. But, maybe consider giving her the same birthday gift that you gave him, and separately give an additional amount as  a Thank You for the help.", "YTA\n\nThis is tremendously unfair to Carl, and it communicates that you show love through monetary favoritism. \n\nAlso very telling that Nora's parents say she has behavior issues, and you yourself say you cannot describe her as polite or kind, but I guess she washed some dishes so she gets a car?", "YTA Your grandson isn't as outgoing. He makes up in kindness what he lacks in assertiveness. It would be different if their personalities were also switched. She does help you and so help her in the same type of ways but not financially making a difference between the two. I believe making such a big difference could hurt Carl and push him further away.", "YTA.\n\nSo you play favorites and then get offended when you're being told you're playing favorites. It doesn't take a genius to know that gifting in massively disproportionate ways is going to make it clear who you favor. \n\nAnyone saying it's your money so it's ok to play favorites is clearly missing the bigger picture. Obligation, or a lack of, doesn't mean you're not an asshole. Playing favorites is harmful.", "NTA \n\nPeople need to stop acting like wanting something is the same as deserving something. You got a gift for Carl that is proportionate to your relationship with him. Nora is getting a gift that is proportionate to your relationship with her. It seems you two have a better relationship bc Nora is making a greater effort than him. No one here is doing anything out of resentment. \n\nSome people are projecting their own relationship onto yours. \n\nAlso, Carl\u2019s parents basically said that Nora is inferior to Carl.", "NTA!

It would be unfair to her to give them the same gifts because she\u2019s putting in a lot more effort to be in your lives.", "NTA\n\nIt logically follows that if one of your grandchildren is going above and beyond to help you guys out, and visits frequently that she would be closer with her grandparents, and sometimes even this means getting nicer gifts than other grandchildren. \n\nAlso, Carl got $1000 for his 16th birthday which is a HUGE gift and nothing to scoff at. Carl's father should be thankful that you guys are giving such great blessings to his kids to help them afford to have a vehicle, or save for schooling or rent or what have you. \n\nYour son is being a bit entitled, and while maybe Nora is being rude to Carl at home, your gift isn't incentivizing that since thats out of your control.", "NTA.  You can do whatever you want with your money.  It sounds like you are rewarding Nora for visiting every day and doing chores.  There's nothing wrong with that.  If you want to even things out, then make it clear to your son that you will give your grandson a similar reward if HE visits more frequently and does chores.  Then see what happens.  I wouldn't be surprised if there is some feeling that grandson shouldn't have to do 'womens work' like chores to get rewarded....\nYour DIL is an AH though, to call Carl a 'better person!'", "Maybe show you gratitude along the way instead? Big birthday gifts should be fair...it causes so much resentment and bitterness when they're not.\n\nYTA.", "YTA, my grandpa did this and he died with neither me nor my cousins around. Even the one he favored (as in: bought her a HORSE, her stocking was always filled with clearly more expensive item, bdays she got more money in the envelope so it was damn apparent) wanted nothing to do with him by the end. She was Nora- always helpful and there the most. My little sister was Carl. He told her \u201cart isn\u2019t a real career\u201d when she said she wanted to paint at 5 (but the favored cousin got art supplies for several years and a private studio in their attic).

You\u2019re not their parents.

I wouldn\u2019t personally do that. \n\nBut I really dislike that your present to the granddaughter you\u2019re very close with is seen as a referendum on Carl who *deserves* more money because Nora\u2019s been rude to him in the past? Grandparents can\u2019t shower grandkids with presents and affection for fear of enabling them?", "NTA\n\nWhat you do with your money is your business. You do not owe them an explanation. They shouldn't have asked.  \n\nThis aside, you say you don't interact with Carl often. Is he really nicer and more polite or do you just not know him as well? Is there a reason Nora has been mean to Carl? What did being mean to Carl entail? If the cousins don't get along, that's between them.", "YTA: You state \"He is also a very quiet and shy and barely interacts with us.\" You mention nothing about making one bit of effort to meet that young man where he is as a person, to get to know him, and to interact with him. Say, a puzzle, or reading books, or whatever is quiet. Thus you've created the inequity in the relationship, and now you're rewarding the inequity which you've created.  \n\nAlso - remember - as minors - that money isn't really under their control.

He is also a very quiet and shy and barely interacts with us.\n\nNora however is the opposite of Carl. I can never describe her as polite and kind however she is the sweetest girl I've ever met. She visits us almost everyday, isn't shy to tell us how much she loves us or how much she missed us. she also helps us like washing the dishes whenever she visits. She is going to turn 16 in a few days and we wanted to do something for her to thank her. We decided to give her 3000 dollars to help her buy a car. \n\nMy son(Carl's father) and DIL were visiting a few days ago. We were discussing Nora's birthday and he asked what we are planning to give her. I was honest with him and told him the truth. He got extremely mad and sid this is not fair as we gave Carl 1000 dollars for his 16th birthday. I explained to him that this is because Nora has been helping a lot so this is to thank her and I'm not trying to favor her. My DIL called us assholes and said Nora has been mean to Carl (she could be a bit mean and sarcastic sometimes) and we shouldn't be rewarding her behavior. I told her this has nothing to do with Carl but she insisted that we are showing favoritism and Carl \"desrves a better gift as he is a better person\" and we are \"enabling\" Nora\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Since Nora is the opposite of Carl I doubt she will be there when you need her and she will rather hangout with friends. YTA!", "NTA however you can go about it in a much better way in my opinion. Whenever my sister and I go visit my grandmother she gives us money for \u201cgas\u201d and \u201cdinner\u201d, not totally useless since we live about an hour away. This means I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve received quite a bit more than our cousins who live farther away as adults (youngest is my sister at 24 years old right now). So instead of giving her a larger birthday gift give her money for visiting in the form of gas or dinner or chore money. Depending on your overall feelings of the situation you can tell her that you\u2019d prefer she kept it quiet (not lying to her parents {instead saying oh grandma gave me some money for snacks but not explicitly volunteering how much money} but not going home and bragging about it and waving money around) or tell both grandkids the new deal (visiting for money) and maybe your grandson will try to have a better relationship with you.", "YTA\n\nGot some lived-in experience with stuff like this. It's why none of my cousins and I talk. Turns out when you're the favorite grandson, the rest of the family just resents you. \n\nIf you want to reward Nora for the help she gives, that's your prerogative. But understand that there's smarter ways of doing it. My grandad used to tip me \"gas money\" when I'd make the drive to come see him. But he never would've flat given me thousands of dollars like that, because he knew that would make a rift in his family (of course, it happened anyways).\n\nAlso, your grandson might have social anxiety or similar, making normal social interaction difficult for him. This might shock you, but that can manifest young. Maybe help him come out of his shell with positive engagement and taking the initiative?\n\nAll in all, you're priming your family for conflict. Might seem minor to you, but my grandad thought the same thing, and now he's alone with alzheimers with both halves of the family too resentful of each other to ever be whole again.", "You obviously know that giving one grandchild more money than another is going to create drama. So it seems you are using this as a way to have a dig that Carl doesn't see you enough. YTA", "It\u2019s a bad look.", "Based on what you wrote: ESH\n\nBased on my gut: YTA\n\nI feel like, as with many of these posts, information is missing. Whether it\u2019s true or not, I find it hard to believe that your DIL said what you relayed to us word for word. Based on how you tiptoed around describing Nora, your side of the story has some holes.\n\nFor example, if Carl is polite and kind and Nora is opposite of him\u2026 describing her as the \u201csweetest\u201d girl you\u2019ve ever met seems like favoritism without a willingness to admit it. Openly paying your grandkids a gift that has a $2000 difference between the two sends a message - whether you like it or not and whether you believe it or not - that Nora is your favorite. Just by \u201cdoing dishes\u201d or being helpful, this does not merit a $3000 gift. For this reason, my gut says YTA\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s your money and you can do whatever you want with it. If you don\u2019t mind paying Nora in a manner that makes her appear the favorite, then that is your choice. Similarly, if what you claim your DIL said is true, then that is terrible from a parental standpoint. That would make your DIL an AH, too. This is why I say ESH. Pretty crappy to display what is clearly ignorant favoritism and equally crappy for your DIL to say that about Nora.\n\nI just want you to understand that, while your money is your money, Carl may see it as favoritism himself and feel less loved. This could cause resentment. Or it might not as I don\u2019t know your grandkids and am just an outside observer on the other side of the screen.", "I was the favored grandchild and I am going to say NTA.

I cooked, cleaned, drove him to the dr, hung out with him and cared for his medical needs. Because of this we had a close relationship. When he died we discovered that he left me a small amount of money. My sibling and cousins did not get anything. I never asked him to leave me anything and I did not help him because I was looking for an inheritance. I was there for him because I was available and that is what family does. My grandpa felt that my kindness was enough to warrant a little something upon his passing. \n\nI strongly believe that everything in life is about relationships.

It also caused conflict with their own kids because no one wants to see their kids treated badly.  By the time my grandparents died, they were permanently estranged from one of their children and her two kids for years.  There was discord between the siblings that never got resolved.  There were hard feelings between cousins that never got resolved.  Basically, the legacy of the choices they made was a fractured extended family that NEVER all were in the same room again voluntarily, even years after they died.  It's not worth it.

He still does and I\u2019m 35+ years old.

My grandpa loves garage sales, for those of us he is closer to, which means we spend more time with him, which also means we help him with whatever he needs doing because the man is always doing something lol He'll remember what we talk about during these times and buy things we mention needing or even just little trinkets he thinks we'll enjoy. He couldn't do this for those of us that don't spend much time with him because he doesn't know much about them beyond the basics they are told during holidays or what the parents tell them about.. He'd be tickled pink for any one of us to call him up and ask him to keep an eye out for something", ">the grandparents and parents are fighting because they have a different favorite child and the parents are mad they prefer the other child.\n\nI think that's a great insight.

Nora is probably \"sarcastic and  mean\" because she is A 16 YEAR OLD GIRL who is possibly looked down upon by her other family members and trying to break out of Carls shadow. They're both nearly young adults and she's probably well aware she's treated like the back sheep for not being \"as good as Carl\" and Carl could be tattling to mommy and daddy that she's \"being mean \" while not exactly being innocent himself. It seems unusual that a younger girl would just bully her older male cousin without prompting but, like you, I am speculating. \n\nI understand that most 16 year Olds are not described as polite.

Hahah", "You could be right. That line where she says she can't call her \"nice\" and \"polite\" but that she's \"the sweetest\" through me for a loop too. Obviously there's more to the story here than we are privy to and it's why we shouldn't be passing judgement solely on one person's side of the story.\n\nI sometimes do side-jobs working at a high school and I've met several 16 year-olds that I would call kind and polite but I've always seen some that are ruthless little monsters. This all just reads as a case of two children where one is an introvert and the other isn't. It makes sense that the introvert doesn't spend as much time with the grandparents as the other because he most likely isn't comfortable there(obviously speculating based on my own personality and experiences). I don't feel he should be made to feel less than his cousin for that though.

It's fine to have different relationships and might even be okay to have a favorite deep down. That's not something you need to shove in their faces though. They shouldn't be treated differently. He hasn't done anything wrong, he just hasn't been as much of a suck up and doesn't do a bunch of random things for you. Feelings for your grandkids should not be based on how much they do for you.

Or he's just shy and awkward and doesn't know how to establish a relationship (which, btw, is on you,  the adults, to establish).\n\nEither way, it's up to you to decide how you want to treat your grandchildren, not because of who they are NOW, but because any perceived trauma compounds and affects who they will become, and like it or not, favoritism in your grandchildren's lives could add to this.", "Yta my nan it blatantly playing favourite and not even hiding it.", "Esh....\n\n>Carl \"desrves a better gift as he is a better person\" and we are \"enabling\" Nora\n\nIs everyone going to bypass that the parents also admitted to having a favorite child?", "NTA. Though to avoid being accused of favouritism give her $1000 on her birthday and then give her the other $2000 the day after as a thank you gift.\nPlus DIL sounds a bit hypocritical saying that Carl should get a better gift for being a better person meaning she doesn\u2019t mind favouritism if it\u2019s her child benefiting from it.", "YTA, one of my sons is very demonstrative and the other is very reserved. Never ever have either set of grandparents favored one over the other. They love them both for themselves. I would go NC if there was favoritism like you described. It's damaging to Carl.", "up to you but good luck explaining all that to poor carl , YTA", "My MIL treats her grandchildren unequally.  My kids get noticeably less of everything - gifts, money, attention.\n\nThey know this.  \n\nAs a result they really don't like this grandmother.  And why would they?  It's also created a wedge between them and their cousins.  When she dies, for my kids it will be like \"oh, well, at least we have (our real) grandma (my mother).\n\nNice legacy to leave behind.\n\nYTA.  YTA.  YTA.", "Maybe he doesn't interact with them cause they clearly show they like his sister more", "We all know I'm my grandma's favorite, purely because I'm the only girl. She loves my brothers and cousins to bits, of course, but she never had a daughter and always wanted one. Really it only manifests in me doing \"girl stuff\" with her. As far as the boys are concerned I'm taking one for the team.", "No you shouldn't. I'd cut ties with my kids grandma if there were clear favorites.", "But did you pick up what the parent said at the end of paragraph?", "I have 9 nieces and nephews ages 2-13. Do I have a favorite absolutely do they know nope. I spoil them equally.", " Sure you can have favourite grandchildren on the downlow, like if they help you out all the time, but this is just blatant", "You're never supposed to make it obvious. Parents even typically do have a favorite, it can change over the years, but the point is not making it obvious.", "Yeah, that jumped out at me.", "I agree. Seven grands and they are treated equally. Same amount of money spent at Christmas and birthday. Occasionally I will buy one some clothes, whoever needs something. We love them all equally--a 12 yr. old, 2 who are 9, 2 who are 6 and 2 who are 3. Sure some are better behaved than others, and next week it might change, but it doesn't affect how much we love them.", "I know how is everyone missing \u201cCarl deserves a better gift because he is a better person\u201d. Guess we know why Nora is always at grandparents.", "1. It sounds like he is there sometimes, but he's just introverted\n\n2.  People like this will complain that they were \"abandoned\" and have absolutely no idea why.", "\n\"Better\" doesn't mean a gift better than Nora's gift.   It means better than the gift he got.   A gift that was 1/3 the amount of Nora's", "My grandparents never showed favortism. Everyone got the same card with $3 at Christmas and $5 on bday.\nThey did not give their things to anyone.  But as an adult my hubby and I travelled 2 1/2 hours once a month to visit.  I\nlearned not to say something was nice or I liked it cause it went home with me.  Then they insisted I take two pieces of furniture. We didn\u2019t want to but finally did (out of their attic) cause it would cause trouble. Yep one aunt threw a hissy fit.  Other aunt said I deserved it cause I visited. Such are families.", "On pretty much my first trip anywhere, I flew to California. On the way back, who was on my flight but Fabio! I was gauche enough to tiptoe into First Class to get him to sign my Cosmopolitan magazine, and he rejected my plain old Bic pen and snapped his fingers and the guy next to him produced a pen that wrote in gold ink and Fabio happily signed my magazine.  Dead.\n\nWhen I unpacked that night I realized that I had an actual 'I can't believe it's not butter' tub right there in my carry on!  (It had a few seashells in it.)  What a missed opportunity.", "Went to Catholic school.  Required reading in our religion class was \u201cEb\nvery thing you always wanted know about sex but we\u2019re afraid to ask.  Probably \u201869 -71.  Was very popular book at that time. Kid you not.", "I was that grandchild who didn\u2019t have a lot of time with my grandparents. We all of us spent a week or 2 in the summer but that was about it.  But as a young adult visited every month-and definitely ended up being the favorite. I lived further but came the most often.  Was given things I tried wholeheartedly refused but ended up eventually taking. Couple pieces of furniture, glasses. Cousins didn\u2019t care but one aunt did but other aunt defended me."]}
