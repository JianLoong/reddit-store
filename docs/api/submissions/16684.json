If she's going to be your neighbour long term, it's best to have a semi-cordial relationship with her.\n\nIt seems odd that she thinks you somehow have sway over the other residents or the building management. Just because you're new residents it doesn't mean you're responsible for deciding how the paint job goes ahead.\n\nYou can email her and tell her you're sorry, but since all the other residents prefer to go through the building management, and they know more about this situation than you do, that you're more comfortable going with the majority decision; if she has issues with that, she should email the other residents who have been pushing for the painting to be done, and that since you're the new residents, you're not the people she should be talking to.\n\nDon't get personal with her the way she has with you. Be polite but aloof in your interactions with her, and if she presses on this issue or any building related ones in the future, reply with \"I'm sorry, I can't help you, you need to talk to building management.\"", "After reply I\u2019m going with YTA\n\nSounds like she b\u2019cc everyone but at that point you should just walk away. \n\nNot your circus not your monkeys! \n\nYou want to pay management, go ahead and pay them. Sending her a FU email or engaging any further is just trying to create drama. \n\n\nInfo was it a group chat / email where she\u2019s asked you?

You can\u2019t tell your tenants to fuck of.", "YWBTA to her. Why? All the other tenants are against you so it would probably be in your best interest to pay her because you don\u2019t know them and don\u2019t know what they could do. For your safety and to be on good terms with everyone, it would be better to just listen to them.", "Ywbta.  Seems like a pretty big escalation to go right to fuck off unless you\u2019re Logan Roy.
