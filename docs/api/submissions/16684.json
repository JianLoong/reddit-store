Just because you're new residents it doesn't mean you're responsible for deciding how the paint job goes ahead.\n\nYou can email her and tell her you're sorry, but since all the other residents prefer to go through the building management, and they know more about this situation than you do, that you're more comfortable going with the majority decision; if she has issues with that, she should email the other residents who have been pushing for the painting to be done, and that since you're the new residents, you're not the people she should be talking to.\n\nDon't get personal with her the way she has with you.
