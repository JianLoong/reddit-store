A few weeks ago at a family gathering the wedding came up and my daughter (11) asked my nephew, her cousin, if she was invited.  They\u2019re somewhat close given the age gap (he\u2019s 25). He told her it was an adults only wedding and although she was kind of disappointed she didn\u2019t make a big deal but expressed again later privately that she was bummed out and hurt.  We end up finding out my cousins daughter (15) also wasn\u2019t invited, so at least we had a baby sitter. \n\nFast forward to the wedding, four other kids younger than mine are there.  There\u2019s a flower girl and a ring bearer so Ignore that, but then two other random people with elementary age kids.\n\nSo as im greeting my nephew and his wife and after giving congratulations  I mention there\u2019s a lot of kids here for a kid free wedding.  He mentions that one of the kids the parents couldn\u2019t find a babysitter and the other one was his wifes friends kid that she\u2019s really close with (wasn\u2019t flower girl or ring bearer).  So I mention to him that he\u2019s pretty close with his cousins, is he not? He was kind of like sorry\n\nAt that point the wife chimes in \u201cit\u2019s my wedding lady I decide who I want\u201d.  At that point I say that\u2019s fine, if you want your friends kids here but my nephew can\u2019t have his cousins than you don\u2019t need us or our gift either.  Told husband what happened and we left. \n\nNow my SIL is calling me the morning after saying I\u2019m a disrespectful bitch and how dare I leave the wedding like that etc\n\nI should clarify that no scene was caused, only my SIL has called me out or mentioned it, no one else probably even heard this brief conversation at the wedding, and my nephew was kind of apologetic in the moment.\n\nPeople saying NTA have also called the bride a bridezilla and controlling so I guess it\u2019s worth mentioning that the flower girl was her cousin and the ring bearer was a mutual friends kid, but more her friend than his. \n\nI also want to add that if I knew in advance about the exceptions being made, I would have declined the invitation, explained why, and respected whatever they wanted to do from there \n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1675535569, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tnk1y/aita_for_leaving_nephews_wedding_and_taking_gift/", "score": 560, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think OP has a right to have been upset. Speaking directly to the person who upset you isn\u2019t making a scene. The bride does have a right to invite whoever they want but making exceptions for your side of the wedding guests and not the groom\u2019s is rude and inconsistent.

You didn't scream or cause a scene and it's fair to be hurt when you discover a child FREE wedding is not in fact a child free wedding they just excluded who they didn't want there.

So incredibly tacky to cause a fuss over this on someone else\u2019s big day. Next time save the conversation for later and get over yourself.\n\nI almost wonder if maybe your kids are just assholes and instead of having to tell you that, they said the wedding was child free.

If you want a childfree wedding, have a childfree wedding.

So it's okay to get your gift and leave.", "ESH I think. Idk, the host can invite whoever they want of course, but can the guest also expect a childfree wedding when the host says it's going to be a childfree wedding? \nI think the guest have the right to know and choose not to attend when some kids are invited yet their kids are excluded.", "NTA it is there wedding and they do get to choose who goes but it seems the bride is the only one who got to make the choices when it came to the non existent \u201cno kids allowed\u201d rule.

Its was okay for the brides friends but not the grooms family.  That is crap.  Either exclude all or don\u2019t do it at all.  The groom most likely went along with it to not cause issues with the bride. You didn\u2019t cause a scene.

I can't fault the bride for her comment, because your timing and delivery were completely inappropriate. Had you addressed being hurt at a later date, and did so without the passive aggressive attitude, maybe the response would have been different.\n\n Also, it actually is their wedding, and they do get to choose who to invite. People seem to forget that it's not all about their feelings. Maybe your daughter and her cousin aren't as close as you would like to think... I mean you act like they are so close in age, it's a  25yo old man and 11yo child.", "NTA.\n\nThey have the right to have a \u201cchild free\u201d wedding.\nThey also have the right to invite a child despite claiming to be child free.\n\nWhich means you also have the right to be upset and leave.

It is up to the couple who they want there, I would not want to open the door to numerous children. \n\nTheir mistake was to make an exception -- but it's also their right.

Kids in the wedding party are usually exceptions to no-kid rules.

They had a \"no kids rule,\" and accommodated guests who could not arrange a babysitter, likely because they'd rather have the guests come with kids than not being able to come at all.

Sometimes I think couples getting married sort of forget social norms regarding polite behavior and expect that any faux pas on their part will be completely ignored because it\u2019s \u201ctheir day\u201d. That can result in really rude behavior which I think was the case here. A child-free wedding is totally fine if it\u2019s enforced universally. However, picking and choosing which children are allowed to attend implies that some are more worthy/important/likeable than others. As the parent of a not invited child, I\u2019m sure that felt shitty and like your child was being excluded for no fault of her own. Had the bride said that it was supposed to be a child-free event but some guests disobeyed the rules and she didn\u2019t have the heart to kick them out \u2014 I would\u2019ve said to give her a pass. Her actual response makes me think she just didn\u2019t want kids from her husband\u2019s side of the family which is unfair.

A few weeks ago at a family gathering the wedding came up and my daughter (11) asked my nephew, her cousin, if she was invited.  They\u2019re somewhat close given the age gap (he\u2019s 25). He told her it was an adults only wedding and although she was kind of disappointed she didn\u2019t make a big deal but expressed again later privately that she was bummed out and hurt.  We end up finding out my cousins daughter (15) also wasn\u2019t invited, so at least we had a baby sitter. \n\nFast forward to the wedding, four other kids younger than mine are there.  There\u2019s a flower girl and a ring bearer so Ignore that, but then two other random people with elementary age kids.\n\nSo as im greeting my nephew and his wife I mention there\u2019s a lot of kids here for a kid free wedding.  He mentions that one of the kids the parents couldn\u2019t find a babysitter and the other one was his wifes friends kid that she\u2019s really close with (wasn\u2019t flower girl or ring bearer).  So I mention to him that he\u2019s pretty close with his cousins, is he not? \n\nAt that point the wife chimes in \u201cit\u2019s my wedding lady I decide who I want\u201d.  At that point I say that\u2019s fine, if you want your friends kids here but my nephew can\u2019t have his cousins than you don\u2019t need us or our gift either.  Told husband what happened and we left. \n\nNow my SIL is calling me the morning after saying I\u2019m a disrespectful bitch and how dare I leave the wedding like that etc\n\nAITA\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I'm going to go with ESH. I had a child-free wedding, but some people disregarded and still brought kids. I didn't want to ruin my day and make a big deal about it, so I didn't say anything or make the kids leave. The bride wouldn't have been an AH, but her reaction after you brought it to her attention makes her one.", "YTA\n\nHow big was the wedding?  2 extra kids in a large wedding is no big deal and as long as those guests had asked, then that\u2019s up to the bride and groom\n\nWhere you become TA is how you needed to bring it up and then argue about it.  TO THE COUPLE ON THEIR WEDDING DAY.   That\u2019s tacky.  You say you didn\u2019t cause a scene\u2026but you did, TO THE COUPLE.   You created an awkward situation by mentioning \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of kids for a kid free wedding\u201d, obviously being passive aggressive.    They then explain to you the 2 exceptions, not that you had a right to know, but you push them again on that point.    When the bride correctly points out that she chooses who she wants at the wedding, you take your gift and leave.    You leave the venue that you RSVP\u2019ed for when you KNEW your child was not invited.  They now have 2 empty seats that they paid for and a memory of an altercation on their wedding day.\n\nSure, be annoyed, your kids missed out, but to get confrontational to the couple on the day is out of line", "YTA. You confronted them on the receiving line? Right after they literally got married? On one of the most important days of their lives, because other kids who are actually close (not \"somewhat\") to the bride and groom got to go to a party and you're pissed at them for that? Well, good going, you took your ball and went home. And that nephew who was \"somewhat close\" to your daughter? Maybe you can find it in your heart to give your daughter a few extra hugs when she's missing him in the future, because no way is he coming around anymore. I hope he surrounds himself with family and friends that are full of love and support for his new marriage.", "ESH. You may not have made a huge scene, but you confronted them at their wedding. Child free weddings should not have exceptions for this reason, but you didn't need to add to the conflict and drama.", "YTA you decided to address this in the reception line? Scene or not, tacky and rude. Pulling the whole \u2018I\u2019m taking my ball and going home\u2019 grow up. Your daughter wasn\u2019t the only child asked to stay home - she was not excluded. Couples are allowed to make game day decisions - the couple that couldn\u2019t find a sitter. And the brides best friend is NOT \u2018random people\u2019 Did you consider that bride may have a special relationship with her best friends daughter or that daughter had been through the whole planning?", "NTA - you were lied to about the guest list. Regardless of the reason, they are the AH.", "YTA. I think people touched on it well enough already, but I wanted to add that rescinding your gift (and announcing tgat you were rescinding it) seals the deal.", "YTA - you don\u2019t get to judge the way they do things. Bride was right. You were rude.", "NTA you either have a kid friendly or kid free wedding. Picking and choosing which kids are invited is cruel", "Nta", "YTA for bringing it up at the event and for taking your gift. If you wanted to leave you should have just said, \u201cwe have to head out now, congratulations!\u201d If you wanted to address the issue it should have been at another time. If you had brought it up ANY OTHER TIME but then I would have said NTA. \n\nAdditionally there are reasons a \u201cchild free\u201d wedding may include certain children outside of the wedding party. It\u2019s not your business why. But for context, at my wedding we had 7 people under 18 despite calling it \u201cchild free.\u201d Three were our own children (who were part of the wedding party) and the others were my cousins children who live out of town. Had we not made the exception for them they couldn\u2019t have come, however we didn\u2019t want to open it up to every person we know who had kids to bring them. Nobody complained because they were adults and understood it was our day and we had reasons for our decisions.", "NTA.  It was her wedding, not their wedding and those wedding seldom last.  Just be there for your nephew, because he will soon not have his own friends.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I think I may have done the same. The way you said she spoke to you seems like the tipping point to your action. If you tell me I don't matter, that means all of me, including my gift.", "NTA and I think you did it rather classy.", "NTA. If the only children there had been the ring bearer and flower girl, that would be one thing. This is just picking and choosing. \n\nYes, it\u2019s their wedding but they should have told you beforehand.", "I'm curious on what takes place at an 18 plus wedding that is different from any other weddings. Is it the booze and super night long partying? Sexualized aspects or just sorry, no screamy kids?", "YTA.\n\nThat wasn't the time or the place to bring it up.  The wedding had 2 entire exceptions to the No Kid list (since you're gracious enough to not count the ring bearer and flower girl).  One of them sounds like a last minute emergency and the bride and groom were gracious enough to allow them in. The other is someone the bride is really close to.  (I wouldn't be surprised if it was her god daughter.)  That's really different than being cousins with a 12+ year age difference.  Trust me, cousins with that kind of age difference are not going to be that close.\n\nLet's face it, you're mad that your kid was told, \"No\" to something they wanted.  Your attitude was, \"My kid didn't get special treatment so screw the couple and their wedding.\"  You gave them attitude at the wedding and when the bride got exasperated you stormed off and took the gift with you.", "YTA. So they were keeping the number of kids to a minimum. You could\u2019ve just enjoyed a night out with your partner and zipped the lip. I and my younger cousins weren\u2019t invited to a number of my cousins\u2019 weddings as kid/teens. We were fine.

If you were hurt about it, you could have brought it up with them later. One could argue that they shouldn\u2019t have lied to you about it, but she\u2019s not wrong. It was their party and nobody really owes you an explanation as to why they didn\u2019t invite your kid. You don\u2019t owe them your presence either so it\u2019s fine that you left. But confronting her about her guest list at her wedding, regardless of why you did it, was very rude behavior on your part.", "ESH ... Because the \"reason\" was not held for everyone, which is not a decent thing to do.\n\nBut OP ... Been reading your comments, and whether or not your child \"wanted to go\" is entirely beside the point.  It is an unrelated issue. Because if your child has NOT wanted to go, the \"child free\" part of the wedding would have not meant anything to you.  In fact, it wouldn't have even been mentioned.  And 11 year olds aren't permitted in lots of places, so it's a \"life isn't fair\" thing.\n\nYou were, however, well within your rights to leave if you didn't want to be there.", "YTA - four kids doesn\u2019t make a child free wedding not child free. Actually two since you admit two of the kids were a part of the bridal party. The two people with kids not in the bridal party were clearly given an exception (one due to closeness with the bride and one due to unforeseen circumstances). You were being extremely confrontational when you made the comment about the kids being there and then further by making a comment about your own child not making the cut. I\u2019m positive that you weren\u2019t as polite as you\u2019re trying to portray based on the bride\u2019s response, especially since you kept complaining after your nephew already said sorry and tried to move on.

I actually received a phone call of a change of venue the morning of the wedding and so attended the new church which was far enough away and at a time to make me miss the entire thing. At a pre wedding party I bought them as a gift a bottle of Moet and some cheap shit glasses(I was going to use vegemite jars but I couldn't get enough of the glass size due to time constraints.) I thought it was funny expensive champagne in shit glasses as it was a reminder of some serious cheap drinking in our history. Turns out the champagne had disappeared from my gift leaving 6 shitty Chinese glasses.\n\nThe second last time I spoke with him I ended up abusing the shit out of him but I had fallen into the trap as she primed me for it when she answered the phone and wound me up.

It isn't like OP appealed directly to her nephew. And the participants are actually able to exclude people, because in general not only is it their day, they are paying an exorbitant per head fee. \n\nAlso other than two kids who were in the ceremony there was one whose mom couldn't find a babysitter and I guess they really wanted her to be able to come. So we are talking about one kid with extenuating circumstances.\n\nSo OP starts an argument and storms out of the wedding with her gift? It's not about her.

Not for this particular scenario I\u2019ve offered, at least.", "Even OP refers to them as...\n\n>They\u2019re somewhat close given the age gap (he\u2019s 25).\n\nThat doesn't sound like they're super close. \n\nThe cousin only asked him a couple of weeks before the wedding, at a family event, if she was invited. Don't you think that an 11year old cousin he was very close with would have asked this earlier, like when around for wedding planning conversations? It sounds like they see each other irregularly at family events, not like they're super close. I could, of course, be entirely wrong about their relationship, but even OP doesn't try and suggest they're super close.", "Sounds like op is overestimating how close the groom considers themselves to be with their kid.", "That\u2019s life. Not everyone gets invited to every event every time. OP could have been the bigger person and seen this as a life lesson opportunity, instead she argued over the guest list at someone else\u2019s wedding, and then stormed out.", "And that wouldn't have been at the wedding, as they would have chosen not to attend. Same results except they wouldn't have wasted their time.", "They can invite whoever they want, they just can\u2019t lie about it being a childfree wedding if exceptions are being made. No way people wouldn\u2019t get pissed if they had to make other arrangements only to find out that even younger kids were actually invited.", "Again, that's just dumb, how can they make unbiased decision, if they don't have the full info? Had they knew from the beginning, they most likely wouldn't have attended the wedding in the fist place. The host withheld crucial information and then was all surprise pikachu face, when OP shown displeasure. Guests expect what is promised/told them, that's just common sense.\n\nYou sound like a terrible host, tbh.", "It's a wedding invite. This is some relationship where you been cheated on or a business deal where someone stole your money. Get serious.", "True! Just got back from reading one where a sister was asking if she WTA for posting a photo of her baby shower when her sister recently lost her child, she hid the details of her sisters husband dying and skipping his funeral and stuff just to get people on her side.", "She is because she's rude and a liar and an entitled twit. You don't get to influence people's decisions about whether or not they want to take time, money, and effort to attend your wedding by lying to them.\n\nOP had every right to walk the fuck out.\n\nWeddings are JOINT occasions and Bridezilla made it plain that the grooms family and by extension the groom, don't count. Yet another reason she's a massive AH.\n\nPlease stop wasting my time by making excuses for her. I'm not interested in your doormat reasoning.", "Yes she can.  But so can the groom.  He had none fro his family.  That is the problem", "are you the bride?", "Except they lied to the guests (or at least OP) about it being a \"child-free\" wedding. Bride can do what she wants, but it's absolutely an asshole move, and OP is not an asshole for being upset and, once realizing she was lied to, deciding she didn't want to support the bride and new husband.", "Nobody is saying they can't select who comes to their wedding. Lying about why you're excluding certain people, and having guests realize upon arrival that they were obviously lied to about why part of their family was excluded is an asshole move.", "Would have the same feelings if the bride made the decision based on race?", "I\u2019d still prefer family not friends kids. I should have worded their closeness differently. I\u2019m not taking my time to carefully phrase things this is reddit", "Or leaving out something about her child\u2019s behavior", "Sounds like her nephew is just marrying an asshole.", "Now we\u2019re getting to it - again \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d is code for \u201cI don\u2019t respect myself or my child enough to address this issue\u201d.\n\nYou\u2019re right, the bride didn\u2019t want the child at the wedding and there is absolutely zero wrong with that, what is wrong is LYING about the child free status of the wedding, and then gaslighting the mother. \n\nIm actually changing my stance, she should have smashed the cake over her and danced on her head.", ">And that wouldn't have been at the wedding, as they would have chosen not to attend. \n\nI understand that part. What I'm asking OP is whether her daughter actually being upset is better than OP being upset on her daughter's behalf. \n\n>Same results except they wouldn't have wasted their time.\n\nIt's only the same result if OP went home and told her daughter, making sure she knew to feel bad. If she didn't, which we can hope she didn't, then currently the child in question is only slightly bummed that kids weren't invited.", "Consider that OPs kids may suck \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nI\u2019ve worked a few weddings as a planner. You\u2019d be surprised how often people will say their wedding is child-free to certain guests in particular during the planning period simply because those individuals have annoying children.", "Nobody is owed an invite to a wedding, family or not. You\u2019re making a lot of wild assumptions here based only on OP saying her daughter and nephew are \u201csomewhat close\u201d despite a 14-year age gap.", "It\u2019s really not. That\u2019s not even the topic of discussion for this post.", "They have to be by how personally they're taking this post.", "Are you?", "Consider the fact that OPs kids may suck and it may have been more gracious to tell op that it\u2019s a CF wedding than it would have been to tell OP \u201cdon\u2019t bring your kids because they behave poorly\u201d.", "Consider that perhaps OP has unpleasant children. It may be easier and more gracious to say the wedding is CF than it is to outright tell OP \u201cwe don\u2019t want your kids coming because they suck\u201d", "You tell me, do you think it would make *sense* for me to have those same feelings? Do you feel that it would be equivalent? Explain the thought process behind this question.", "But it sounds like that's not the case with the people who were paying for the wedding. I expect they're far closer with the few children they invited.", "He also chose not to invite his niece.", ">Im actually changing my stance, she should have smashed the cake over her and danced on her head.\n\nI feel better knowing that my previous feelings about you simply being an unreasonable human were in fact, correct. Thanks \ud83d\ude04", "I\u2019ve been described by others as highly confrontational and I still think the aunt\u2019s behavior was really inappropriate and kind of pathetic actually. The kid wasn\u2019t owed an invite and hassling someone about the guest list at their own wedding is such childish behavior. She should have simply addressed it at a later date.", "Daughter:\"Am I invited?\"\nNephew:\"No\"\n\nDidn't need to be mention of childfree, just simply that she wasn't invited. Seeing as it was a few weeks to the wedding, he could have followed up with \"I didn't know you wanted to attend, but we already have everything set for those who told us they were coming, maybe you can come to my next one\""]}
