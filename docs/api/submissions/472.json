For context my godfather asked to borrow 5k back in 2019 when I got an inheritance from my deceased father, my mother told me to only give him 3k  so I did. He said he would use the money to invest, I asked him to sign some papers and to make a contract but he refused and said that it hurt that I would think he wouldn\u2019t pay back so I dropped it. He said he would pay back  the money in a year (2020). Well it\u2019s been over 2 years and he has payed nothing back. The time that he has deposited any money is because I have to repeatedly call him, but now it\u2019s gotten to the point where he doesn\u2019t answer my calls or messages. I\u2019ve left him messages even with his son and he says he\u2019ll let him know but I never get any calls back. I was thinking of calling my godfathers mom to let her know about the situation and ask her to pass along the message since he is Mexican he does have that dumb macho thing and I think he\u2019ll listen to his mother. I don\u2019t know if that would cause any issues or if it would be a petty thing to do. But I feel like I don\u2019t have any other options. To make matters worse I am 20 weeks pregnant and this whole situation makes me stress out since I know I could use that money for the new baby. So, WIBTA if I call my godfathers mom to let her know that her son owes me money?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the advice and help. I know I should\u2019ve drafted an agreement or something but I was pretty naive back in 2019 since I had just turned 18. \nI would like to mention that even though everyone has said to take this to small courts I don\u2019t think I can go through with it not because of him but because even though I\u2019m a US citizen, I currently work and reside in Mexico so I wouldn\u2019t really have the funds to cover for an attorney back in the states or the time. \nI\u2019ve come to peace with the idea that I\u2019ll probably NEVER see that money back, I even told his son once that if he would just take my call and say \u201cNO, I won\u2019t pay back now stop bothering\u201d I would and that\u2019s all I would need to hear. I guess this was just a last attempt to try and obtain anything back. So, I will go ahead and do it and even if he doesn\u2019t pay back I\u2019ll be happy to prevent anyone from making the same mistake I did and lending him money.", "created_utc": 1667161824, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhp18p/wibta_for_calling_my_godfathers_mom_to_tell_her/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
