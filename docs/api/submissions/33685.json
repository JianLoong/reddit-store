We\u2019ve spent the past few Thanksgivings and Christmas in our home state. As a Christmas gift and a way to give my wife an experience she\u2019s always wanted, I booked the three of us a mini getaway to Disney World for Christmas 2024, which also includes Christmas Day.\n\nToday however, when doing our gift exchange with our family in our home state, my mother-in-law became very upset about our trip and started asking why I would do that to her. I said \u201cthis isn\u2019t about you. It\u2019s about giving [wife] something she\u2019s always wanted and deserves.\u201d We also said that I only kept it a secret so that it wouldn\u2019t get spoiled and that if they wanted to join us they were more than welcome to. She visibly got upset and then stormed off and locked herself in her room. She started accusing me of intentionally keeping my wife and son away from her and the rest of our family during the holidays. She also stopped talking to us the rest of the night. My wife felt guilty for receiving the gift and I began to feel like an asshole for upsetting my MIL because I was only thinking about doing something to make the missus happy that would also help us make some fun memories. I even was considering shifting the dates of our trip just to make peace. However, my MIL then started texting my wife and 1) accused me of plotting a Christmas trip away with my family over on the East coast on purpose in order to have two back-to-back years away for the holidays, and 2) berated my wife for allowing me to mistreat her in such a way.

You did something very special and kind for your wife and child. Your MIL does not get to dictate how you spend Christmas! It is one day and you can celebrate before or after your trip with her. Your MIL needs to get a grip and grow up! \n\nLet her pout all she wants. You look forward to your trip and enjoy every minute of it!!!!", "NTA \n\nTell your mother-in-law that they can have dinner \"BEFORE\" the trip, but DO NOT change the dates of your vacation, you are an adult and you and your wife have the right to decide what to do with your time.\r  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, I ALWAYS recommend talking to your partner first before deciding what to do on important dates.\r  \n\r  \nI hope your baby is better now.\r  \n\r  \nHappy Holidays!", "NTA The best thing about creating your own family, is creating your own memories and traditions. Sounds like MIL is attention seeking and self centered", "NTA\n\nI hope your MIL comes to her senses and apologizes for her overreaction. You didn\u2019t do anything malicious. It can be so difficult to transition from being mom with your kids at home to mom with adult children, having their own babies. This is not an excuse for her reaction but just a perspective to help see why she had such an emotional reaction.", "Where is your wife in this? You need to step way back and let your wife handle this. She wanted that trip, and you just booked it. So wife can just handle this since this is her family.\n\nI would say in general holidays are a sensitive time for everyone and since this is family that has really helped you out in the past, don't meet anger with anger. Have your wife find out about her concerns. We don't always have to go tit for tat with those we love...especially those we love.", "MIL sounds unhinged, controlling and toxic.\n\nDon't change your dates and nip this behavior in the bud, giving her what she wants will only reinforce it. Your grown adults that can make your own decisions. NTA", " NTA - makes me dread tomorrow when I have to deal with my MiL and it not being her year to see us on Christmas Day because I actually have the gall to want to visit my family on Christmas Day every few years.", "Yea NTA. Enjoy the trip with the family.", "NTA and don\u2019t change the dates! I\u2019ve heard Disney is great during Christmas time, and if your wife loves the gift and is excited then you and your wife don\u2019t need to worry about what your MIL has to say.", "NTA. But your wife seriously needs to establish some boundaries with her mother. She should be the one to deal with her crazy behavior", "NTA, your MIL sounds like a problem. The only way you\u2019d be TA is if you did this deliberately to upset her, which from your post, is definitely not the case. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and your wife shouldn\u2019t feel guilty either. I feel like this is one of those moments where if you let this work once, it will be a problem for life\u2026", "NTA. \n\nThat being said, Disneyworld over the holidays with a toddler is going to be a nightmare. Travelling during RSV and flu season with your child currently (this year) and next year when he has already been ill and seems susceptible  also sounds like a terrible idea, but your kid, your choice.", "NTA!!
