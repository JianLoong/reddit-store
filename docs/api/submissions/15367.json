You're putting up with bullshit that they wouldn't tolerate", ">He was upset because I didn\u2019t say happy birthday to him earlier\n\nNTA - Were you expecting someone 12 years older than you to be more mature?", "INFO: How did you feel when he texted you at 12am on your birthday? \n\nDid you think it was thoughtful and sweet, and appreciate that he made the effort to be the first to wish you happy birthday?\n\nOr did you think it was a bit silly, and would have preferred to have waited until you saw each other?", "NTA. He's 35 and like this? Over saying happy birthday? Enough to think you don't really care about him? I'm guessing this isn't the first emotionally manipulative move he's used on you. I don't always think an age gap matters, but you're probably still in school or just starting out and he's at a very different stage in his life. It's very possible 35-year-old women won't put up with his nonsense.", "YTA. If you are speaking to someone and you know it is their birthday, you wish them Happy Birthday.", "NTA it is a bit odd that you didn't say happy birthday in the phone call when you clearly remembered it was his birthday, but his reaction was way out of proportion. You could have simply agreed that next year you won't hold back and say it right away, why start a fight over it?", "NAH\n\nIt\u2019s just a difference on how you feel on the subject. Birthdays bring up a lot of *weird* feelings in people sometimes. Maybe friends or family forgot his birthday once and it hurt him a lot so he\u2019s sensitive to it now. And while it may not be a big deal to you, it is a big deal to him. You didn\u2019t know that prior to this though so you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. It\u2019s a learning experience is all.", "Man, some of these comments! We're not here to judge their age difference, folks.\n\nYTA. Not a huge one, but I think most people would be hurt if their partner just didn't bother saying happy birthday the first time they spoke that day.", "NTA, but that\u2019s kind of borderline and mostly because he said \u201cyou didn\u2019t ANSWER the call with happy birthday\u201d. \n\nI can understand feeling confused that you didn\u2019t just say happy birthday when you talked. It honestly does make it sound like you forgot. No need to wait to say it. But do I think you need to be watching the clock at midnight? My god, no. \n\nIf you wanted to REALLY be the AH just tell him you didn\u2019t bother saying it because he\u2019s already had 12 more than you and it\u2019s not fair. \ud83d\ude02", "NAH. This is a very small thing, and just a difference in communication. Similarly, some people in relationships like saying \u201cI love you\u201d a lot, and some don\u2019t. Some like a text every morning and some don\u2019t. \n\nThe thing is how you both behave when there is an expectations mismatch. Is the disappointment communicated well? Is the need heard and attended to? As long as you two can handle these things as they come up, you are golden. (I am raising my eyebrows at the age difference, but won\u2019t cast aspersions on that alone.)\n\nApologize for not saying it and acknowledge that now you know he likes that. It is an understandable difference of opinion that is easy for you to accommodate.", "ESH. Him for getting so upset about someone not saying happy bday soon enough at THIRTY FIVE. Him also for dating someone 12 years younger. And you because you purposely chose not to say happy birthday for a stupid reason. I believe you were being manipulative.", "NAH. \n\nI mean, you aren\u2019t the AH because he had an over the top reaction. But, I don\u2019t really get you either. You didn\u2019t wish him happy birthday on the phone because you wanted to do it later instead? You can wish someone happy birthday more than once\u2026", "NAH\n\nBirthdays matter a lot to him. Less so to you, clearly, but that's just a differing of values. Now you know for next year.", "YTA. Look at this from his perspective. It's his birthday, and late in the morning, he had to be the one to call you, and you didn't wish him a happy birthday. He isn't psychic, so in that moment, it would have seemed as though you'd forgotten all about it. It's not a surprise that he thought you didn't care.\n\nSince you knew he sent you a text immediately on your birthday, you didn't think to send him a text that morning? Not at midnight, but in the morning once you woke up and sorted yourself out for the day? And for some bizarre reason, you didn't want to acknowledge his birthday until whenever you saw him, much later? \n\nIt isn't a dealbreaker, but you were a bit thoughtless on this one. Just explain the situation, communicate, and you'll hopefully both be fine.", "YTA, why wouldn't you say it earlier in the day? Can you only say it once? This is weird.", "NAH. When it\u2019s my partner\u2019s birthday I say it like 100 times throughout the day, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a one time thing. You\u2019re not TA for feeling differently; and he\u2019s not TA for wanting you to say it. It\u2019s a personal preference thing, doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s in his 30s lol. Just say it earlier next year it\u2019ll make him feel special.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve learned a good rule of thumb with birthdays is to just ask people what they like and want, especially those closest to you. Takes all the guesswork and mind reading away. Seems as though you two have different ideas of what makes you feel valued on your birthday - just communicate about it.", "You are too young to be dating a 35 yo.\n\nThis man isn't looking for an equal partner he's looking for someone he can love bomb and manipulate. Does he do other things that seem controlling/manipulative?\n\nYes saying \"happy birthday\" first thing is customary but not necessary if you're going to see him later on in the day. \n\nNTA", "NTA- you knew it was his birthday and had good intentions. you just didn\u2019t think you needed to say it right then. you probably should have, cause you can always say it again later. there\u2019s no rule that says you shouldn\u2019t say happy birthday more than once. but he is definitely acting like a cry baby about it", "NTA if you didn't know this before, but at least you know now that birthdays are a big deal to him (they are to some people).  but if you knew this already, and you only didn't tell him happy birthday because it's not a big deal to YOU, then yeah, YTA.", "I'm gonna go with NAH\n\nI think you both just treat birthdays differently. My partner and I are the same.\n\nI'm like your boyfriend. I used to text my partner at 12am and would've loved for him to do the same but he didn't. Now we live together, I have to wait for him to wake up properly before I get a 'happy birthday'. It used to upset me at first because I love my birthday, so I can see why your partner is upset. People saying to dump him are crazy. \nI just know now that's just how my partner is. He doesn't care about birthdays (his own included). On his birthday, I care more than him and am dragging him out of bed to open his presents. \n\nYous just need to communicate and understand that you guys will treat birthdays differently.", "I'm gonna say YTA yeah. I would never ever not immediately say happy birthday to my loved one when I talked to them that day.", "YTA, why wouldn\u2019t you say happy birthday?  You don\u2019t care enough to be excited on his special day.", "YTA in this particular instance yeah.", "I\u2019d say YTA here but not by a long shot. He\u2019s probably feeling out of sorts because he\u2019s turning 35 and you\u2019re so much younger. It probably makes him feel weird about it already and then you not saying happy birthday may have, in his mind, confirmed that his feelings were accurate.", "YTA- I am bias tho as my bf forgot my bday last year altogether \ud83d\ude2a", "NTA.   \nBut communication is fundamental in a successful long term relationship.\n\nIf he knew about your evening plans, then he was wrong to say what he did. If he didn\u2019t, you should tell him.", "NTA and you need to leave his ass", "He\u2019s too old to act like this. You\u2019re too young to put up with it. NTA", "Yta.  It doesn\u2019t hurt to say happy bday to someone when you know it\u2019s their birthday.  Not sure why you couldn\u2019t just say it twice.", "I do think you suck for not texting him happy birthday or calling him to say happy birthday. Clearly he wanted to hear from you and was sad when he got to late morning without you acknowledging it was his birthday. However with the age difference and his reaction, I\u2019m seeing \ud83d\udea9 with your BF, so I\u2019m going for ESH", "NTA - Expectations can ruin otherwise beautiful days.", "NTA\n\nGeeze!!
