He's 35 and like this? Over saying happy birthday? Enough to think you don't really care about him? I'm guessing this isn't the first emotionally manipulative move he's used on you. I don't always think an age gap matters, but you're probably still in school or just starting out and he's at a very different stage in his life. It's very possible 35-year-old women won't put up with his nonsense.", "YTA. If you are speaking to someone and you know it is their birthday, you wish them Happy Birthday.", "NTA it is a bit odd that you didn't say happy birthday in the phone call when you clearly remembered it was his birthday, but his reaction was way out of proportion. You could have simply agreed that next year you won't hold back and say it right away, why start a fight over it?", "NAH\n\nIt\u2019s just a difference on how you feel on the subject. Birthdays bring up a lot of *weird* feelings in people sometimes. Maybe friends or family forgot his birthday once and it hurt him a lot so he\u2019s sensitive to it now. And while it may not be a big deal to you, it is a big deal to him. You didn\u2019t know that prior to this though so you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

Is the need heard and attended to? As long as you two can handle these things as they come up, you are golden. (I am raising my eyebrows at the age difference, but won\u2019t cast aspersions on that alone.)\n\nApologize for not saying it and acknowledge that now you know he likes that.

It's his birthday, and late in the morning, he had to be the one to call you, and you didn't wish him a happy birthday.

It's not a surprise that he thought you didn't care.\n\nSince you knew he sent you a text immediately on your birthday, you didn't think to send him a text that morning? Not at midnight, but in the morning once you woke up and sorted yourself out for the day? And for some bizarre reason, you didn't want to acknowledge his birthday until whenever you saw him, much later? \n\nIt isn't a dealbreaker, but you were a bit thoughtless on this one. Just explain the situation, communicate, and you'll hopefully both be fine.", "YTA, why wouldn't you say it earlier in the day? Can you only say it once? This is weird.", "NAH.

If it was an older woman getting upset at a younger boyfriend but saying Happy birthday? Still be the immature guys fault right?\n\nHe also made a point of text her happy birthday at midnight on the dot. So that\u2019s a sign to her that he does value birthdays, so either have a conversation to find out or just take the hint and do the same. \n\nThere will be little things to her that mean a lot that won\u2019t to him, but if he values her, he\u2019ll work out that out. \n\nYTA.", "Disagree - I think it gives massive red flags around being controlling and emotional manipulation. \u201cMade him question whether OP really cares\u201d? Yikes! Like others have said, there\u2019s a reason he\u2019s dating so much younger. NTA OP, get out.", "Yeah, look at her older post. She also isn't allowed male friends and stuff.\nHe's a creep", "She probably wanted to save it as a surprise with all the things she had planned later. No big deal imo, it is not as if she had forgotten.", "This YTA. slightly. Its like pretending you dont know and being surprised when they react like you didnt know. Everyone that Ive spoken to on the phone on my bday (that knew) said happy birthday at some point in the call. I imagine this is the norm.", "I can't believe I had to scroll so far to find this comment. How hard is it to say happy birthday?", "She could have but clearly she wanted it ti make an impact and mean something when she said it. Bf should have seen that", "I tell my husband Happy Birthday at least 3-4x on his birthday \ud83d\ude02 he's getting old so I gotta be the one to remind him\ud83d\ude02", "Honestly it gets awkward, tiresome, and cumbersome when someone has to tell you multiple times throughout the day 'happy birthday'. Once is fine.", "I dislike the age gap personally, but the Y-T-As are obviously all about it instead of the situation, and if they were the same age, it would be really obvious that OP was being thoughtless. \n\nIf anyone put themselves in the boyfriend's shoes, if they were 15, 30, 50 or even 80, and the same thing happened to them from anyone that they loved, they would be hurt. It's common sense to me.", "All of that!", "It's purely the age gap. I dislike the age gap, but here, it's not the issue.\n\nIf a 70 year old grandmother sent a text to her grandson on his birthday as soon as she woke up on the day, but on her birthday, she had to call him, and he didn't wish her a happy birthday, where his defence was, \"I wanted to wait to say happy birthday when I visited her later because I sorted a gift and planned taking her to dinner,\" and the grandmother told him that she was hurt by him not wishing her a happy birthday, then the comments would be full of Y-T-As.\n\nIt's literally the same situation. Partner, relative, friend. If they have to call you and you don't acknowledge their birthday, they're going to feel hurt.", "Because when a significantly younger woman is being yelled at by her much older boyfriend about not doing things exactly the way he wants them done, people get a bit suspicious.", "He expected her to answer the phone with \"Happy birthday!\" She's not a mind reader. NTA", "Me at 37 when husband wishes me happy birthday \"oh, shit! It's today!\"", "Which never made sense to me. Apparently you (general) want to celebrate something with someone you care about and your first instinct is to make them feel like no one cares and later to make them feel dumb about feeling that way?\n\nSurprises still work even if it starts out positive. \"You care\" -> \"You care a lot!\" is a lot better for everyone involved.", "I was hanging out with my bestie the other day and she says 'hey, want to come to my place for some cake?' so I agree and she and her wife are mucking about putting candles on the cake and I ask 'what's the occasion?' and they laugh and when the cake is ready her wife starts singing her happy birthday and I was like 'what? It's your birthday????'\n\nIt was indeed my besties birthday, and this is how I found out my phone calendar had stopped sending me reminders for events.", "Its not so much 'pressure' to do it face to face, its that to some people electronic communication is lazy and impersonal. It would make me think that my birthday was a chore to them. \n\nIt would be a different story if I wasn't going to be seeing them around my birthday.", "How do you know what \"life stages\" they're at, whatever that means? Also why do you have to be in the same \"life stage\" as your partner?", "Why are you getting downvoted for spitting facts?", "Yes. I don't wish to die on it", "Maybe he wants to go with younger women, it doesn't have to be a choice by default.\nI'd even argue most men would find a 23 yo more attractive than a 35 yo albeit also less mature but some people don't care about that.", "35 is not middle aged...
