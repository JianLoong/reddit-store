He's 35 and like this? Over saying happy birthday? Enough to think you don't really care about him? I'm guessing this isn't the first emotionally manipulative move he's used on you. I don't always think an age gap matters, but you're probably still in school or just starting out and he's at a very different stage in his life. It's very possible 35-year-old women won't put up with his nonsense.", "YTA. If you are speaking to someone and you know it is their birthday, you wish them Happy Birthday.", "NTA it is a bit odd that you didn't say happy birthday in the phone call when you clearly remembered it was his birthday, but his reaction was way out of proportion. You could have simply agreed that next year you won't hold back and say it right away, why start a fight over it?", "NAH\n\nIt\u2019s just a difference on how you feel on the subject. Birthdays bring up a lot of *weird* feelings in people sometimes. Maybe friends or family forgot his birthday once and it hurt him a lot so he\u2019s sensitive to it now. And while it may not be a big deal to you, it is a big deal to him. You didn\u2019t know that prior to this though so you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

It's not a surprise that he thought you didn't care.\n\nSince you knew he sent you a text immediately on your birthday, you didn't think to send him a text that morning? Not at midnight, but in the morning once you woke up and sorted yourself out for the day? And for some bizarre reason, you didn't want to acknowledge his birthday until whenever you saw him, much later? \n\nIt isn't a dealbreaker, but you were a bit thoughtless on this one.

I know he felt like an ass. I think he thought it would be cute to \u201cpretend to forget\u201d but it wasn\u2019t. \n\nTo top it off, I started a new job a couple months ago (my birthday was last Friday) and so no one at work knew me well enough to know my birthday. It just wasn\u2019t a fun day.", "What are you, 12? She got him a gift and dinner plans. Who gets this butthurt over not getting a birthday greeting? It\u2019s so immature.", "Exactly..thank you. This comment is perfect. Everyone is calling him an AH and immature.. which I agree he prolly shouldn't have responded that way. But from his perspective i can totally understand how it would seem to him. OP just communicate. wish him on call, via text, at the dinner..BFD. why wait until the end of the day. \nAlso the age gap is really weird to me no offense.", "Yeah.  It's one thing to express your hurt or disappointment at not being told Happy Birthday right away, but his saying that it showed she didn't care is emotionally abusive.  IMHO.", "He's 35 and can't be excited bout his bday?", "The age gap is more of an issue when one of the people is under about 25 years old. There is a huge difference between 23 and 35 than say 35 and 47. One involves a person that is still finding their footing as an adult. The other involves two people that are already adults and know who they are as people. At 23 you\u2019re still learning about who you are and how to spot red flags in others.", "I almost think that's an insult to teenagers.", "For me, saying it to a loved one without any gift or card or plan at first is awkward. I would rather say it when presenting the gift. \n\nThat's how I've always known people to do it when a gift is expected", "No", "Lol, nah they're not. I am OPs boyfriend's age, my friends give me shit when it turns out the person I was chatting to is close to OP's age. You're assuming celebs are like norms (and on many of those cases, they're not kind on the older woman). Or maybe you're looking at your friend group and are assuming it's universal.", "Why?", "Ugh, the \"pretending to forget\" thing never works. I hate that shit. Sorry your birthday wasn't great, here's hoping the next one is amazing!", "It's not immature to want you partner to acknowledge it's your birthday when you speak to them, no. Some people may not care, but others do. Respecting your partner's feelings by saying a very simple two words is the adult thing to do.", "Him getting upset that she didn't answer the phone saying happy birthday is ridiculous..", "I think that really depends on the 23 year old. For the longest I preferred partners older than me but I was out on my own by the age 11. So, a lot of the world was already pretty apparent to me. Conversely, the particular 35 y/o in this post doesn\u2019t sound as mature as most 23 y/o people I know. At the end of the day we have to make a choice on when someone is an \u201cadult\u201d and then unilaterally give them that respect and agency. Personally I feel that 21 is the right age. I think it\u2019s absurd that 18 year olds are allowed to make life changing choices, go to war, spend the rest of their life in prison etc etc", "How is it awkward to say \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d on the phone, when there would be no expectation of handing a card or gift over, since the other person is not physically there? Yes, OP, YTA. You can say \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d more than once. Not doing so during your first conversation of the day makes you look like you forgot your boyfriend\u2019s birthday.", "I mean, I guess everyone is different, but a simple, \u201chappy birthday, I can\u2019t wait to give you your present tonight\u201d seems completely normal to me.", "No it's totally true. Deep down you know it is that's why you resort to insults", "Such a dumb argument essentially saying nobody has any agency before 25. You\u2019ve used the range 18-25 to try and illustrate your point in bad faith, you don\u2019t hit 25 years old and magically that\u2019s it, you\u2019re only now capable of having personal agency and being held accountable for your choices.", "Well, there\u2019s a reason women his own age won\u2019t date him. At 23, the brain isn\u2019t even fully developed.", "Thank you!! I highly doubt he will ever make this mistake again! He\u2019s normally very thoughtful and intuitive so I don\u2019t know what in the world made him think that was a good idea.", "His feelings are ridiculous? How would you feel is somebody you loved said that.", "Saying \"happy birthday\" is seen by some people as the start of the celebrations. So to not start anything can make it seem like you aren't going to do anything for them.\n\nThis is a different approach and it's also very common. I don't think it's fair to get angry that someone has \"forgotten your birthday\" when the day isn't even over.\n\nNTA OP.", "No, it's really not true. Most people are just as grossed out by old lady/young man relationships.  But if you only consume certain media, all you'll see is outrage-bait designed to convince you that a fringe opinion is actually a widely-held belief.", "What are you talking about ? people criticise women for dating significantly younger men all the time. Google Aaron Taylor Johnson. Have a read about some of the women harry styles has been linked to. Screaming \u201cbut what about when women do it!!!\u201d is just boring when it\u2019s got nothing to do with it", "lmao no they wouldn't.  I know there are people who consume a certain kind of media who think so--because they're fed countless \"this is what liberals believe\" ideas which are really just amplifications of the fringe.  Most people, hell most *liberals*, don't have the beliefs you think they do.", "Oh, look, Alanis Morissette posts among us, friends.", "I see. Thank you.\n\nEdit to ask:\nWhat if she was 33 and he was 45? He would still be that much older than her. Would the age difference matter? The way your original comment was worded, I thought you meant he was an AH just because he is 12 years older.", "Everyone messes up from time to time, but it sounds like you've got yourself a good one, so I'm sure he's already planning next year \ud83d\ude09", "But the boyfriend didn\u2019t get angry, he got upset that OP, throughout a whole telephone conversation, implies to us that they didn\u2019t seem to once acknowledge his birthday. That also heavily implies it has been forgotten. Upset and anger are two entirely different emotions. And OP says upset. Not angry. And I still don\u2019t see how anyone could imagine you are trying to start a celebration by saying \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d over a phone. Are \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d the code words for the cake to be parachuted in?", "It would depend on how long they had been together, but the ages themselves matter mainly, a 10 year old and a 22 year old would be disgusting, a 23 year old and a 35 year old is downright weird, why would he ever want to date someone so much younger then him and has so little life experience when he is in his middle ages? I think that is what people are focusing on", "The idea is that her OP is at the age of a college graduate/recent graduate while this 35 year old man is old enough to have a teenage kid", "No, but also human brain matures at 25. Most people in my country study until 25 and they don't have a solid career until 26. Giving it a huge life situation disbalance where one person is set and confident in who they are and the other is just finding out their work life. This lets the younger one get dependent on the older one easily which can be easily abused. Basically, power imbalance.\n\n33 and 45 are way beyond that. With both having their own identity and knowing what they want from life.\n\nIf they were 26 and 38, I'd be understanding of it more too, although it would be weird.\n\nBasically, why would a working adult want to date someone with no solid ground to stand on? Maybe it's love maybe they're both great people but the chance of the older one being an abuser is too high to ignore.", "Ignore the other commenter. There is no problem with someone being 12 years older assuming everyone involved are legal adults. I'm the younger partner in a relationship like that and there's nothing inherently wrong with it. People who are abusive will be abusive regardless of the difference in age.", "This is true and I do! \u2764\ufe0f I eventually forgave him lol.", "Something being LEGAL is not an indication that it's \"no problem.\"", "Yeah, people have a tendency to treat something that *might* be a problem as if it *is* a problem.  A significant age difference between adults *can* lead to or indicate problems in a relationship, but it's not at all a guarantee of such.", "Correct. However, just because something is outside of your personal comfort zone doesn't mean that it's a problem. It's totally fine if you don't want a relationship with someone ten years older or younger than you. Frankly no one should care what you want out of a relationship, it's your own business. Kindly, don't pass judgment on strangers for benign, consensual things just because you feel personally uncomfortable. It's not a great look :)", "Exactly.", "I'm in a relationship with someone a decade over. I also am not 22-23. I'm not unconfortable. Human brain development is pretty straightforward.", "Yeah I should lose my right to vote until I'm 30 too lmao. Fuck off. No one over the age of 18 gives a shit about brain development because at that point, we're all adults and people like you telling us what we should and shouldn't do are infuriating. Go misgender a trans person or whatever it is you people get off to."]}
