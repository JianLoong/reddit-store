He's 35 and like this? Over saying happy birthday? Enough to think you don't really care about him? I'm guessing this isn't the first emotionally manipulative move he's used on you. I don't always think an age gap matters, but you're probably still in school or just starting out and he's at a very different stage in his life. It's very possible 35-year-old women won't put up with his nonsense.", "YTA. If you are speaking to someone and you know it is their birthday, you wish them Happy Birthday.", "NTA it is a bit odd that you didn't say happy birthday in the phone call when you clearly remembered it was his birthday, but his reaction was way out of proportion. You could have simply agreed that next year you won't hold back and say it right away, why start a fight over it?", "NAH\n\nIt\u2019s just a difference on how you feel on the subject. Birthdays bring up a lot of *weird* feelings in people sometimes. Maybe friends or family forgot his birthday once and it hurt him a lot so he\u2019s sensitive to it now. And while it may not be a big deal to you, it is a big deal to him. You didn\u2019t know that prior to this though so you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

Is the need heard and attended to? As long as you two can handle these things as they come up, you are golden. (I am raising my eyebrows at the age difference, but won\u2019t cast aspersions on that alone.)\n\nApologize for not saying it and acknowledge that now you know he likes that.

It's his birthday, and late in the morning, he had to be the one to call you, and you didn't wish him a happy birthday. He isn't psychic, so in that moment, it would have seemed as though you'd forgotten all about it. It's not a surprise that he thought you didn't care.\n\nSince you knew he sent you a text immediately on your birthday, you didn't think to send him a text that morning? Not at midnight, but in the morning once you woke up and sorted yourself out for the day? And for some bizarre reason, you didn't want to acknowledge his birthday until whenever you saw him, much later? \n\nIt isn't a dealbreaker, but you were a bit thoughtless on this one. Just explain the situation, communicate, and you'll hopefully both be fine.", "YTA, why wouldn't you say it earlier in the day? Can you only say it once? This is weird.", "NAH.

It\u2019s not a hard adjustment. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e likes to be surprised with birthday gifts. I prefer to know ahead of time. So she ask me what i want for her birthday, and on hers I hand her a wrapped (or bagged) present.", "So do you specifically avoid any topic about their birthday before seeing them? I\u2019m wondering why there\u2019s so much pressure put on saying it face to face. Maybe even just acknowledging it and saying \u201cI\u2019ll tell you happy birthday in person\u201d is better, but straight up not saying anything I find really strange.", "We don't have anything that suggests the BF *wasn't* feeling dumb after that?\n\nLike if he's still angry after that showing of care, then yes, he's absolutely an asshole and she should dump him. But if he's not, and is apologetic? Not so much.", "That's great for you! But recognize that plenty of people have traumatic experiences related to their birthdays and that you being well adjusted doesn't make people who don't have that luxury into assholes.", "Except that his reaction fits the trope. Probably not a coincidence.", "It is though", "Yes I would 100% judge a 35 year old woman for dating a 23 year old man, that would be creepy", "You wrote all that to still be wrong. Shame on you.", "The fact that they are in significantly different life stages is why the ages are not appropriate.", "They're at different life stages with different levels of experience in a way that can create a power imbalance, especially in situations of conflict.", "I recognize and honestly agree with everything you\u2019ve said and yet still also recognize how immature it is to get genuinely upset at someone because they didn\u2019t wish you happy birthday in the exact way you wanted, especially when said person has a verifiable plan to celebrate said birthday. \n\nIt is incredibly immature.", "I'm reminded of a birthday in my early twenties.\n\nI'd had a job interview that hadn't gone as well as I'd hoped, my train broke down so we were all crammed into a replacement bus, after waiting in the rain for that bus, I felt a head cold coming on... my best friend called me while I was on that bus, literally shoulder to shoulder with several strangers. Her singing happy birthday blared out of my phone and it was just awkward and didn't feel happy at all.\n\nTLDR we don't know where the phone call happened, I can think of situations where I'd feel uncomfortable having such a personal moment via the phone.", "Really? You guys are pretty silent about it when it's a cougar and a young dude", "But have you noticed how these age gap posts rarely, if ever, involve younger men/older women? Have a think about that.", "13 year olds on r/AmItheAsshole trying to ruin a relationship of 2 adults", "Then don't date one?", "Ah fuck, well since you've said it, it must be true.\n\nThank you <3", "Your reasoning for this?\n\n\"not appropriate\" is cloth armour to hide behind.", "You presume. And that's my point.\n\nI'm 25 and had to move back in with my dad. 2 Years ago my job was still being funded and I had disposable income.\n\nAge does not equal success or power. Plus - as we can see, he is the childish one here. He is \"fully developed\".", "OP doesn't say whether or not he knew about the dinner and gift, though. If he didn't, he could have been thinking she just wasn't acknowledging it at all. But even if he did, it seems weird to me to talk to him the morning of his birthday and NOT say \"happy birthday\". I don't see how it is immature to feel a bit hurt by her intentionally ignoring that it was his birthday.", "I wouldn't get upset about someone saying hello when they answered the phone..", "Saying \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d and singing the whole song are entirely different things. And also entirely different to your best friend hypothetically deciding to not acknowledge your birthday at all. Would you have been even more uncomfortable and even possibly upset that on such an already bad day your best friend decides to not acknowledge your birthday? We will never know.", "Someone else explained it much better than I could. But in a nutshell, the mind isn\u2019t fully developed until 25 or 26, and the boyfriend is old enough to have a kid in their early teens. Plus, there\u2019s gotta be a reason that women his own age won\u2019t date him, which is why he has to go after much younger women.", "You need to trust those in your life more and have discussions when they don\u2019t meet your expectations, not get mad at them for something you *think* has happened. It\u2019s 100% a maturity thing\n\nIt was his birthday morning and I know plenty of people who operate on the \u201cI\u2019d rather wish you well to your face\u201d motif that OP also works on.", "You wouldn't, but he does on his birthday. Just because you wouldn't doesn't mean his feelings aren't valid...", "Yeah, I see your point about singing vs. saying it.", "So are mine and I feel like he's too old to act that way..", "Well it isn't about you \ud83e\udd23", "Doesn't change that OPs boyfriend is childish"]}
