She has been raised to take your money in lieu of love from you. \n\n- she reached out to rebuild the only connection she has ever had with you and you declined it.\n\nNewsflash: being a parent is NEVER not your responsibility. Taking some financial responsibility for your 25-year-old is pretty common for parents who can afford to do so these days, even if your legal requirement to pay has ended.\n\nBut in your case the money spent earlier was so far below the bare minimum parenting requirement to make you even halfway adequate during her childhood and early adulthood that your moral obligation to the stranger you should have been raising has not really ended.\n\nHoly crap YTA - you have had (and missed) plenty of opportunity to be a real parent; time to step up and do what you can to fix this.", "YTA.  Not because you aren't giving her money.  Yta because you watched your daughter obviously severely struggle with her mental health and gifted-kid-burnout syndrome, didn't recognize the signs, and assigned all of her problems to \"laziness\" and \"lack of work ethic\" without taking the time out of your day to actually investigate what was going on.  Kids don't go from taking 18 credit hours (a horrifically stupid thing to do that no one should have let her do) to flunking their courses unless they are profoundly suffering in serious ways.  But you responded to this with hatred and contempt instead of compassion.", "YTA and your replies in the comments are infuriating! No wonder your daughter struggled with her mental health with you two for parents. Yikes", "I think YTA as well.\n\nSounds like your ex was toxic if not emotionnaly abusive towards your daughter who must have been seriously struggling as a child and couldn't handle college because she had a lot of issues.\n\nYou only saw your daughter on WE. And I'm guessing that with life and her becoming a teenager, it wasn't every WE. How could you think you could have taught her anything with so little time while still given her everything she wanted. \n\nYour daughter dropped out after two years so she was around 20. You stopped talking then and she is now 25. 5 years without talking to your daughter. Weren't you worried ? Didn't you care ?", "YTA. Majorly. I feel bad for your daughter, sounds like both her parents are awful", "YTA because of your comments she dropped out because of her mental health and you expected her to deal with it .", "Info: do you know why she declined in her academic record and dropped out?", "YTA. I think your daughter has been subject to pretty severe emotional abuse - going from the Dean's list to dropping out was a serious red flag - and you don't seem to have even considered that she was struggling. In fact, as long as she made things easy for you it doesn't sound like you took too much interest in Cassie - it's not like she confided in you that her mother was manipulating her - and now she has reached out to her father for the help you should have provided years ago - and no, we're not talking about money here - you shrug your shoulders and go 'not my problem'. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "Sorry, but YTA. The fact that she's no contact with her mother shows what a toxic relationship they had- if she was that unhappy at college, of course she failed- the choices she made were probably not her own. If you can afford it, help her- show her she has at least one parent who will show their support.", "YTA for coming here looking for reinforcement instead of actual judgment and dismissing your daughter\u2019s mental health issues. Do what you want with your money but when your daughter goes NC with you, too, it\u2019s not going to be because of tuition.", "Wow, seeing the way you talk about your daughter here, the way you minimize the legitimacy of mental health struggles, the way you\u2019ve described your (lack of) parenting\u2026 yeah, YTA, and it sounds like a chronic problem. I feel so sad for your daughter, being stuck with two parents who clearly have no business being parents at all.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d you say as you put in zero effort to make sense of it. For someone who takes so much pride in their ability to work hard, you sure didn\u2019t put a lot of work into understanding your daughter. What *does* make sense is that in thirty years, when a retirement home is bleeding you dry of the money you\u2019ve chosen to prioritize above everything else, she won\u2019t be visiting and won\u2019t have any reason to feel bad about it.", "YTA and its so sad seeing you reply to comments. When your kid goes NC with you, youll be sad you missed the chance to be in their life", "Reading your responses reminds me of my dad. I went every other weekend with him and goddamn I feel for your daughter. Help her by supporting her struggles don\u2019t just tell her to \u201cwork harder\u201d YTA with every fiber of my being. I hope that she makes something amazing of herself while leaving you in the dust", "YTA. You hate your daughter and always have. You think money can replace love, but it can't. Your hatred drops from every word. No wonder she's struggling... living in a cold world made of money.\n\n'I tried to teach her lessons about work ethic, good education and a meaningful and lucrative career' - money money money, all the money... wonder why she's depressed and no contact with neither of her parents.\n\nYou have dollars instead of  a heart, a  woman who dumped you and a daughter who won't talk to you. But you will not care about that because you have money and that's all you can see and or care about. You are definitely a major AH, and you should never have married and definitely should never have brought kids into this world.", "As a parent, I think you need to evaluate what your priorities are. If your goal was to be \u201cright\u201d by discounting your daughter\u2019s needs & struggles, there would be no point in posting on Reddit. Your daughter has reached out to you for help - she\u2019s ready to move forward, and she asked you to assist her. You have an opportunity to be a valuable influence in her life. This doesn\u2019t mean trying to make her do what you want; it means supporting her until she can be a positive, productive member of society on her own. You were a weekend dad from before she can remember and now she\u2019s asking you to step up. You have a powerful choice to make because there is a lot of your own struggle wrapped up in your decision making process - \u201cmy parents were immigrants; kids have it too easy.\u201d This doesn\u2019t seem like you are listening past your own issues to your daughter\u2019s needs. If you can help your kid, and your issues really seem to be with her mom, why wouldn\u2019t you? YTA for asking if you should support your own child, but we all start somewhere.", "YTA.

No.  When your child is asking for help and you have the means to help but refuse, then YTA.   \n\nThis whole mentality some fathers have that once their kids are 18 they can just fuck off and leave is ridiculous.   Don't get stuck in this ultimatum. Find a compromise.  If you want to instill your work ethic and values, you have to actually spend time with your daughter and you know, talk to her rather than just judge.", "Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I feel like a lot of the YTA\u2019s are focusing too much on OP as a father instead of focusing on the question he has posed. I wholeheartedly agree that based on what I\u2019m reading, OP isn\u2019t exactly the best father figure in the world, that much is clear. But at the same time, that\u2019s not what the focus of his post is. So let\u2019s look at this without the background information and with an unbiased perspective\n\nOP gave his daughter a FREE RIDE for her entire education, no strings attached. All his daughter had to do was study and keep her grades up, which is apparently something she\u2019s very capable of doing if we\u2019re taking OP at his word. He didn\u2019t even ask her to get a job, he just wanted his daughter to focus on her studies and graduate\n\nTwo years in, and suddenly her grades are slipping and she waits to tell OP that suddenly she doesn\u2019t want to do school anymore and she wants to work. OP is obviously upset because it\u2019s his money being spent, and if she is flunking her classes, his money is essentially wasted. They argue, and both go their separate ways and they don\u2019t communicate for a long time (to those who say OP didn\u2019t try hard enough to reach out to his daughter, the inverse can be equally as true here. Staying unbiased)\n\nNow after a long absence from each other, OP\u2019s daughter suddenly calls out of the blue, and she makes what is essentially small talk before immediately asking OP for money so she can go back to school (which she said she didn\u2019t want to do anymore, mind you) and naturally, OP isn\u2019t comfortable doing that anymore, considering what happened last time he was paying for everything\n\nWith all that being said, I\u2019m saying OP is NTA. At the end of the day, it\u2019s his money. He was willing to keep paying as long as his daughter kept studying, to which she flunked her classes and told OP she didn\u2019t want to do school anymore. At that point, he has every right to withdraw his money. Since the daughter dropped out before, who\u2019s to say she won\u2019t do it again? \n\n(On a side note, the ex is a soft AH for thinking that her ex-husband would just be willing to dish out more money for college after the daughter dropped out the first time. That\u2019s a lot of wishful thinking)", "OP? AITA is heavily populated with people your daughters age.

So, she trusted her mom and went to a school she didn\u2019t want. She worked in a way that was unsustainable and had to leave.
