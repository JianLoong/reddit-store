I've managed people for over 40 years; their business is their business and I don't get up in it.  Pregnancy is just another thing I have to plan for.  \n\nManagers have deliverables; good managers take employee needs into account, but they cannot compromise their deliverables.  The work needs to get done and my job as the manager is to ensure it does, not hold baby showers.  Does that mean I'm an asshole to the lady?  No.  I accept the input and integrate it into my personnel planning. \n\nSome of you will bleat \"you have no empathy!\"  Wrong, I just don't get personal with my employees.  Getting personal is often misinterpreted, and can be career-limiting in today's litigious environment.", "YTA.\n\nPregnancy is a big deal to work through. She was trying to start the conversation of maybe she will need accommodations in the future; What happens if she has a high risk pregnancy and is out for 6 months? Will she be getting maternity leave?\n\nIf you were a co worker I would still give a soft YTA, as the boss you're a massive ass.", "NAH. These are just like different personalities. Like I would be thrilled if I went to my boss to share some necessary but personal news and they didn\u2019t really ask me any questions. I hate having to share any personally details at work. I even hate when I get back from vacation and people ask me how it was, you know?? I guess you probably should have said \u201cCongrats!!\u201d But I don\u2019t think this makes you an asshole. And as long as you accommodate her appropriately, that is what really matters.", "NTA.\n\nMany commenters are talking about \"Congrats\" being basic social convention and things along similar lines. I'm not my direct managers friend. My direct manager is not my friend. It feels fake as fuck when he asks me about personal stuff. We're geographically disparate, we don't have contact outside of work, and I don't expect them to give a fuck or pretend to give a fuck about what's happening in my life. I've had and do have co-workers/managers I'm friends with, but that's certainly not the default.\n\nFurther I think it's absurd to assume that OPs employee is happy about being pregnant. When someone tells me this news, and we're not at some announcement party or in some obviously positive framing, I pretty much just stare at them until they give me some sort of indicator. There are myriad possibilities here, and only one of them is that they were trying and are happy about it.", "YTA.\n\nIt's amazing how much of the managerial class are incompetent  self centered weirdos.", "YTA - you at least owe a duty of care to start doing the health and safety assessments for a pregnant employee, or ask if they need any accommodations for their health.

It's along the lines of saying good morning or thank you or have a good day.

You're her manager, not her friend. Asking personal questions can become an HR issue.

Did it occur to you that she might have been informing you for logistical reasons?

Is there a cure for that?\"", "you say \"I wasn't rude\" directly after describing a rude reaction", "NTA. Your response could be interpreted as rude, but that doesn\u2019t make you TA.

This could be be taking place in one of those states. Even if it's not, getting an abortion can be financially prohibitive if the woman doesn't have good health insurance (which is unfortunately too common) or is in an abusive relationship (partner is controlling and won't let her make her own decisions), so she may not have access to abortion care despite living in a state where it's legal.\n\nThat said...regardless of whether this is a happy pregnancy or not, OP wasn't compassionate enough. OP should have been more engaged and voiced support by saying something like, \"Thanks for letting me know; if there is anything I can help you with, please don't hesitate to come in and chat anytime. I can also get an appointment with HR set up for you to take care of time off needs and maternity leave, if you'd like.\" It's a neutral response, but supportive and compassionate to the employee regardless of her situation.", ">She wouldn\u2019t be telling her boss about it if she weren\u2019t planning to keep the baby.\n\nNot true in my experience", "As the saying goes, \"People don't quit jobs; they quit managers.\"", "I really don't mean this to be rude, and I'm trying my hardest to quit Reddit with all the bullshit but..\n\n..Could this person be autistic?

It was my first thought and a quick glance through a post history just reads a 'flat' tone. \n\nLotta assuming I'm doing.", "Is guess I\u2019m also an asshole when I say I don\u2019t care/need to know why they are calling off. Unless it\u2019s a group health risk like Covid, you can call off and say nothing, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re pooping your pants or going to Disney world\u2026", "I don't give fake condolences. It doesn't feel natural to me to be fake about something that I don't feel. I can't overcome having dishonest feelings. \nThe same way I won't say \"I'll keep you in my prayers\" when I know I'm not going to pray. And is not being an insensitive asshole. it is being honest and not fake.", "What a lame \"milestone\". A teen can pull that off. Why feign excitement?", "I struggle there bc I have never been able to fake enthusiasm. I will always have the back of my people, and will never put the company in front of an innocent employee\u2026 but I just can\u2019t fake enthusiasm/interest.", "I was wondering this as well. When I was in college a guy that was on the spectrum lived near me in the dorm. I went through a bad break up and was sobbing\u2026and he came in to see what was up.

I don\u2019t harass or insult them, I don\u2019t belittle them.", "I actually have little to no problems in social situations, I\u2019m not old (not a boomer) or really grumpy, quite the opposite\u2026 I just have an inability to fake interest or enthusiasm, I\u2019m not outwardly rude about it\u2026 I just choose not to force it", "I don\u2019t know if I am or if I\u2019m not, but I made it this far in life.", "I\u2019m not arguing with anyone, just adding clarification and background to how I process things and where my management philosophies are based.

OWED.", "Bust out laughing at this ^^", "Millennial actually", "These are two extremely different scenarios. Calling in is purely work-related, pregnancy is not. You aren't an asshole for choosing not to pry into your employees' personal lives. Basically disregarding someone's pregnancy is a different story. Look, I would urge you to reconsider congratulating her or something of the sort. If I heard just \"okay\" from my manager after announcing that I'm expecting a child, I would feel rightfully upset and unsupported.", "Yes, you are an asshole if you don\u2019t care why they\u2019re calling out. If an employee on my team were sick, or their family were sick, I would care. Not caring about the people on your team is an asshole move.", "That is one way of doing things. It doesn't make you an AH if you genuinely put people first which means you'll never go out of your way to be horrible to one. Social graces do make for a warmer workplace with better morale, but it is up to you to decide what kind of a work environment you want to maintain for your employees. NTA\n\nEdited for clarity", "By saying just \"okay,\" the employee might get the impression that their boss does not care about their pregnancy. As a boss, this is extremely concerning considering the fact that pregnancy drastically impacts someone's ability to work. Employees receive support through their employers via baby showers, extra accommodations to ensure comfort, maternity leave, among other things. If your boss isn't even excited that you're expecting a child, how can you expect that they will ensure all the following steps happen effectively?", "You don\u2019t have to fake enthusiasm or interest. You don\u2019t even need to ask any follow up questions. You just do the polite thing and say congratulations.", "Do you have issues dealing with problem employees or behavioural situations? How would you deal with an employee that comes to you and cries because their parent is dying? \n\nIf you can\u2019t fake enthusiasm, then how do you deal with other emotions that come with managing a team?", "I don't think the problem is struggling to fake enthusiasm, it's that you don't have any to begin with. As somebody who oversees other workers, it's your job to build interpersonal relationships with the people you work with so that they become comfortable around you, and comfortable in the workplace. I also manage employees, and this is extremely important to me, more so than their value as a worker. You should feel excited for this individual, and it's sad that you don't see her as anything more than an employee. All you had to say was \"congratulations.\"", "Yeah. I'm a woman and I actually think the way OP does but that behavior in a girl is absolutely unacceptable so I had to learn the very hard way how to navigate and understand these meaningless rituals. I still hate small talk.\n It's always such a relief to meet other NDs because I don't have to do the exhausting social making.", "But words do matter.", "Well, my question then would be what were your actions besides saying \"okay\"? If it was just that, it probably sounded to your employee like she told you she finished a routine assignment. If you said, \"Okay, good to know. I will make sure you get all the support you need from the team/company, and let's plan to check in a few times to make sure you've got what you need.\" Or something like that. Then you're not saying congrats, but you're showing through both words and actions that you're taking it seriously and being supportive.", "I've been in her position, it's not fun. It's nerve wracking to tell a coworker, boss, or client that you are pregnant, there is still a lot of negative criticism that comes with it in the workplace and most women don't know which coworker will respond negatively until they themselves are in the hot seat.\n\nShe's probably worried now that you'll treat her differently.", "\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That\u2019s only part of what employees need", "Saying congratulations isn\u2019t faking interest\u2026 you sound like a joy to work with", "Lol nothing is owed to anyone. It\u2019s called common decency.", "They are your BOSS. They do NOT need to care about your pregnancy. They need to accommodate the time off for it. No job owes you a baby shower, or extra accommodations for \"comfort\". The only \"following steps\" that need to happen effectively are ensuring the time off gets pushed through and that their workload is picked up. You know, the parts of a business that are required. Everything else is petty fluff.", "If something terrible like that happened, I\u2019d let them know that they do not need to be at work, and work is not important and to go take care of what they have to.

There are studies on this and it pays to be human with your team.", "I don't know if your employees are customer-facing, but if they are, I *guarantee* they fake enthusiasm every single day. It's called *professionalism*. You showed an enormous lack of professionalism in your response to your subordinate.", "What about interpersonal issues within the team? Dealing with issues where performance is effected by an emotional situation? \n\nAlso, how long have you been a manager? \n\nLook, I\u2019m a good people manager and I\u2019ve shaped some bad teams into high functioning ones. This took some sort of humanity on my end, including empathy for some situations that were less than ideal.", "Special treatment is stupid", "Interpersonal, it\u2019s pretty easy\u2026 this isn\u2019t middle school, drama is not needed. I will take all parties statements into consideration, will accommodate changes within reason and respond accordingly depending on the outcome of the investigation. I also will make sure to remind people that everyone views situations differently, and that we all to a point deserve the benefit of doubt. I\u2019ve been managing people for this company for over a decade, currently I have over 150 employees that I lead.", "It\u2019s not special treatment. Sad that you think that and shows me you probably had shit managers. \n\nI just know that by being human and supporting them as people, I\u2019ve had the most productive team, very very little turnover and they keep on referring me the best people they know. So, I\u2019ll continue being a great people manager and doing well on my end!", "150 employees, that explains everything. When you have that many employees you can forego any type of human contact and concentrate on the bottom line as a whole.\n\nIt\u2019s nice that you could manage effectively for over a decade. I personally would hate to have you as my manager as I would feel like I am not important. Funny enough, you not saying congratulations to a pregnancy announcement would leave such a bad taste in my mouth. I would not feel comfortable sharing any issues that bother me as I am an emotional person and you would make me feel like I couldn\u2019t express that side of me. I would probably eventually search for a different leader where I would feel more comfortable.\n\nI don\u2019t doubt that you are successful, but I think you\u2019ve just encountered a person that has seen your weakness.", "Have you considered that maybe you're not neurotypical? The way you're responding and the fact that you can't see the issue here seems like maybe you have issues with empathy and social cues?"]}
