I wasn\u2019t rude, or mean\u2026 just very matter-the-fact.\n\nEDIT: to clarify my management mindset\u2026 I care more about my people than the companies Bottomline. I believe work is not the most important thing in the world. I made and will make all the proper accommodations when the time comes. I aim to have the employees stress free and to spend the minimal time here while providing the maximum compensation.\n\nEDIT2: I\u2019m shocked by the number of people that seem to have been able to figure out every single aspect of my life and know about every interaction I\u2019ve ever had from this one example. A few clarifications, I didn\u2019t actively think \u201cI\u2019m not gonna say \u2018congrats\u2019\u201d, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to be an asshole, if I were then I wouldn\u2019t have posted on here. Also, I understand how what I did could be interpreted as a heartless or mean thing, so I can see that POV. \n\nEDIT3: just bc I have difficulty showing empathy it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have empathy. Also, this employees general tone is a but on edge, and when she presented this information she didn\u2019t seem particularly excited or eager, but maybe she was just being professional too.

My boss doesn\u2019t have kids, has never been interested in kids but did the whole \u201cif you need anything please let me know and oh yeah, congrats\u201d thing.

I'm not sure you understand everything \"managing\" your employees entails.", "YTA. Would it have killed you to say congratulations or ask when she was due? Did you think to ask about how she plans to handles Dr. appts. or about what you can do to help her?", "NTA, you don\u2019t have to pretend to care about something that you don\u2019t care about.

I've managed people for over 40 years; their business is their business and I don't get up in it.  Pregnancy is just another thing I have to plan for.  \n\nManagers have deliverables; good managers take employee needs into account, but they cannot compromise their deliverables.  The work needs to get done and my job as the manager is to ensure it does, not hold baby showers.  Does that mean I'm an asshole to the lady?  No.  I accept the input and integrate it into my personnel planning. \n\nSome of you will bleat \"you have no empathy!\"  Wrong, I just don't get personal with my employees.  Getting personal is often misinterpreted, and can be career-limiting in today's litigious environment.", "YTA.\n\nPregnancy is a big deal to work through. She was trying to start the conversation of maybe she will need accommodations in the future; What happens if she has a high risk pregnancy and is out for 6 months? Will she be getting maternity leave?\n\nIf you were a co worker I would still give a soft YTA, as the boss you're a massive ass.", "NAH. These are just like different personalities. Like I would be thrilled if I went to my boss to share some necessary but personal news and they didn\u2019t really ask me any questions. I hate having to share any personally details at work. I even hate when I get back from vacation and people ask me how it was, you know?? I guess you probably should have said \u201cCongrats!!\u201d But I don\u2019t think this makes you an asshole. And as long as you accommodate her appropriately, that is what really matters.", "NTA.\n\nMany commenters are talking about \"Congrats\" being basic social convention and things along similar lines. I'm not my direct managers friend. My direct manager is not my friend. It feels fake as fuck when he asks me about personal stuff. We're geographically disparate, we don't have contact outside of work, and I don't expect them to give a fuck or pretend to give a fuck about what's happening in my life. I've had and do have co-workers/managers I'm friends with, but that's certainly not the default.\n\nFurther I think it's absurd to assume that OPs employee is happy about being pregnant. When someone tells me this news, and we're not at some announcement party or in some obviously positive framing, I pretty much just stare at them until they give me some sort of indicator. There are myriad possibilities here, and only one of them is that they were trying and are happy about it.", "YTA.\n\nIt's amazing how much of the managerial class are incompetent  self centered weirdos.", "YTA - you at least owe a duty of care to start doing the health and safety assessments for a pregnant employee, or ask if they need any accommodations for their health.

This is your employee, not a friend or family member. Okay isn\u2019t a bad response either. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d And taking a mental note for when she get bigger depending on her job she might need to take it easier then maternity leaves when the time comes.

I would never pretend to care about someone's pregnancy, even my friends.", "NTA- but would it really have hurt you to say \u201coh wow congrats!\u201d  ?", "YTA you could have said any number of things. really just a simple congratulation would have been enough its not like it would have been hard.", "NTA but going forward,  get in the habit of saying congrats or I'm sorry to hear that,  depending on the situation. It's along the lines of saying good morning or thank you or have a good day. We all know it's just a social nicety, but those niceties are what get us through the day.", "NTA \n\nNot needed to have additional celebration just have her pregnancy acknowledged when it comes to work.", "Nta how is her pregnancy a big deal to you?", "NTA. You're her manager, not her friend. Asking personal questions can become an HR issue. Unless you need to discuss FMLA, there's no reason to ask her about a pregnancy.\n\nETA you probably could have at least smiled and said congratulations though lol", "NTA it sounds like your the type person who just doesn\u2019t get emotional and saying that she\u2019s pregnant is not really a conversation that should take place during work hours. Heck most the of the questions people would usually ask are inappropriate during the work place. You didn\u2019t nothing wrong and started thinking ahead of how to accommodate her.", "I don\u2019t think you are an AH. Maybe more social grace but it\u2019s not owed. An AH would have been \u201coh gosh that is terrible news. Or yuck I don\u2019t like children.\u201d But manners dictate some form of actual acknowledgement. But no you are not the AH", "YTA. Did it occur to you that she might have been informing you for logistical reasons? She'll need to know if there's any paperwork to fill out for parental leave, how much time off she's entitled to under local laws and/or company policy, discuss preparations for her absence, etc. With that being said, a simple \"congratulations\" would have been nice, too.", "If you care more about your people than the bottom line, you must REALLY not give a shit about the bottom line. \n\nYTA.", "\"Oh my God, are you okay? Is there a cure for that?\"", "you say \"I wasn't rude\" directly after describing a rude reaction", "NTA. Your response could be interpreted as rude, but that doesn\u2019t make you TA.
