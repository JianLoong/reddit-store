I've managed people for over 40 years; their business is their business and I don't get up in it.  Pregnancy is just another thing I have to plan for.  \n\nManagers have deliverables; good managers take employee needs into account, but they cannot compromise their deliverables.  The work needs to get done and my job as the manager is to ensure it does, not hold baby showers.  Does that mean I'm an asshole to the lady?  No.  I accept the input and integrate it into my personnel planning. \n\nSome of you will bleat \"you have no empathy!\"  Wrong, I just don't get personal with my employees.  Getting personal is often misinterpreted, and can be career-limiting in today's litigious environment.", "YTA.\n\nPregnancy is a big deal to work through. She was trying to start the conversation of maybe she will need accommodations in the future; What happens if she has a high risk pregnancy and is out for 6 months? Will she be getting maternity leave?\n\nIf you were a co worker I would still give a soft YTA, as the boss you're a massive ass.", "NAH. These are just like different personalities. Like I would be thrilled if I went to my boss to share some necessary but personal news and they didn\u2019t really ask me any questions. I hate having to share any personally details at work. I even hate when I get back from vacation and people ask me how it was, you know?? I guess you probably should have said \u201cCongrats!!\u201d But I don\u2019t think this makes you an asshole. And as long as you accommodate her appropriately, that is what really matters.", "NTA.\n\nMany commenters are talking about \"Congrats\" being basic social convention and things along similar lines. I'm not my direct managers friend. My direct manager is not my friend. It feels fake as fuck when he asks me about personal stuff. We're geographically disparate, we don't have contact outside of work, and I don't expect them to give a fuck or pretend to give a fuck about what's happening in my life. I've had and do have co-workers/managers I'm friends with, but that's certainly not the default.\n\nFurther I think it's absurd to assume that OPs employee is happy about being pregnant. When someone tells me this news, and we're not at some announcement party or in some obviously positive framing, I pretty much just stare at them until they give me some sort of indicator. There are myriad possibilities here, and only one of them is that they were trying and are happy about it.", "YTA.\n\nIt's amazing how much of the managerial class are incompetent  self centered weirdos.", "YTA - you at least owe a duty of care to start doing the health and safety assessments for a pregnant employee, or ask if they need any accommodations for their health.

It's along the lines of saying good morning or thank you or have a good day. We all know it's just a social nicety, but those niceties are what get us through the day.", "NTA \n\nNot needed to have additional celebration just have her pregnancy acknowledged when it comes to work.", "Nta how is her pregnancy a big deal to you?", "NTA. You're her manager, not her friend. Asking personal questions can become an HR issue. Unless you need to discuss FMLA, there's no reason to ask her about a pregnancy.\n\nETA you probably could have at least smiled and said congratulations though lol", "NTA it sounds like your the type person who just doesn\u2019t get emotional and saying that she\u2019s pregnant is not really a conversation that should take place during work hours.

You didn\u2019t nothing wrong and started thinking ahead of how to accommodate her.", "I don\u2019t think you are an AH. Maybe more social grace but it\u2019s not owed.

Did it occur to you that she might have been informing you for logistical reasons? She'll need to know if there's any paperwork to fill out for parental leave, how much time off she's entitled to under local laws and/or company policy, discuss preparations for her absence, etc. With that being said, a simple \"congratulations\" would have been nice, too.", "If you care more about your people than the bottom line, you must REALLY not give a shit about the bottom line. \n\nYTA.", "\"Oh my God, are you okay? Is there a cure for that?\"", "you say \"I wasn't rude\" directly after describing a rude reaction", "NTA. Your response could be interpreted as rude, but that doesn\u2019t make you TA.

Can\u2019t you see the difference?", "Ok, well I guess with all the responses here you now realize this kind of announcement is an instance in which at least minimum courtesy is important.\nAs a recently pregnant person, I don't expect my boss to be excited or even happy (I am not one to talk about my personal life at work), but if she just responded \"Okay\", I certainly would have taken it as she's unhappy about it, or does not give any shit about me/my well-being.\nA pregnancy is a huge deal to someone, and it affects work.", "Lol seriously, if you asked me to write a textbook example of someone reacting defensively to being told they\u2019re reacting defensively, I couldn\u2019t do much better than this.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter to me, dude\u2014 no judgment, I\u2019d probably react defensively too to a chorus of people telling me I\u2019m an asshole. We\u2019re all human. Just trying to help you be self-aware.", "Regardless, what they are suggesting is still a good idea. Come back after the emotions have died down and see it with a more neutral perspective. Separating yourself from the situation for a bit and then coming back tends to give us clarity.", "It really isn\u2019t lol", "\u2018Okay\u2019 was robotic.", "As a female, I think your response is fine tbh. Youre a manager: I hate when managers want to know about my personal life. Obviously this person wanted you to know, and was disappointed in the fact that your relationship wasn\u2019t what she thought it was. I think \u201cokay\u201d is fine, because not everyone is comfortable talking about the topic of pregnancy. It\u2019s rude of them to assume you should be happy hearing about it. Not everyone shares the same worldviews.", "People aren't mind readers, you have to say what you mean to be a clear and direct communicator, otherwise it causes miscommunication. Your intent to be supportive of her leave when it comes was absolutely not apparent.", "To you or her? Because to her it came off as \"OK, I don't care\".", "Well, you said they were acting upset, so to me that indicates that (for a super lack of a better phrase) hurt their feelings. Obviously someone\u2019s feelings being hurt isn\u2019t an indication of your wrongdoing.\n\nAlso, I just want to be clear, did you only say \u201cokay\u201d and that was it? Your added edit expresses that you will take all the correct steps to ensure she has support, but did you communicate that to her?\n\nAlso, did she have an excited or expectant expression or tone when she told you the news? As a rule of thumb, if at all possible I try to match the emotive state of the person who is talking to me. There are just so many aspects to communication that are more than just facts.", "You were rude, though. Just saying \u201cokay\u201d is rude. It\u2019s dismissive.   Think about if you were really excited about something. A new puppy maybe. And you tell a coworker. They say \u201cokay\u201d. Instead of \u201cCool, what kind?\u201d Or \u201cThat sounds nice.\u201d   It\u2019s rude. Our society expects a small amount of small talk amounts colleagues and cutting it short without a little bit of interest is considered rude.", "You don\u2019t have to be best friends but showing an ounce of respect is expected in general society. If a stranger comes up to you and is pregnant I\u2019d expect someone to say \u201cCongratulations\u201d to show a general interest in humanity. \n\nI\u2019m literally teaching this to managers at my company right now. How to be kind human being to their employees.", "You don't have to be best friends to be happy for a fellow human who you interact with daily. \n\nI'm not best friends with my coworkers, but given that we spend so much time together, we are at least friendly. Your reaction is very strange. I wouldn't want to work for someone who couldn't be bothered to at least say congratulations about a major life event.", ">you shouldn\u2019t be fed that BS of \u201cwe aren\u2019t a company, we are a family\u201d\n\nYeah, that whole line of BS coming down from people who gain big money from convincing lower-level employees that \"wE'rE a FaMiLy\" is pretty messed up. Makes me gag every time I hear it.", "I think the point is that even if you have to keep it, that doesnt mean its a happy or wanted pregnancy...", "I feel like I'm getting culture shock! I don't really understand the difference between this being or not being a sick day - I would think she'd want that vs using a vacation day or unpaid time off. Regardless, I'm glad she got the time.", "in other words, she didn\u2018t have to tell her boss the details.\n\nFor some reason, she found that preferable to using a sick day for what it\u2019s for.", "Ah shoot, yeah that wouldn't have worked then. Good for her for standing firm on it then", "Defending yourself and adding context is different than being defensive, often being defensive is to attack, it\u2019s to deflect, it\u2019s to make excuses\u2026 I\u2019m not doing any of that. I feel like you feel that any response to anyone\u2019s comment = defensive", "I don\u2019t have any emotions regarding this, I think that\u2019s what people are getting at lol", "I agree. I got pregnant while working and don\u2019t expect any congratulations from anyone. Nor did I want fake ones. \nI just wanted my boss to know. \n\nSure everyone is different but people act is if the response was unkind. It was acknowledgment. \n\nSee post of people questioning this person\u2019s management style and talking about social skills. \nNone of this seems like a big deal to me.", "It\u2019s not like she said \u201cew, ok\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "She said \u201cokay.\u201d She expressed exactly how she felt. It\u2019s the weirdo preggo girl and her coworkers who are weird AF and reading into things.", "Why does she have to care? There\u2019s no issue with \u201cok.\u201d The issue comes with \u201cif you miss any time this will negatively impact you\u201d but what kind of entitled princess expects a whole-ass party anytime she mentions she\u2019s pregnant?", "And honestly she seemed less than excited herself", "Sorry, upset as I\u2019m off-put, not angry or sad, etc.", "You don\u2019t know what society she is part of. Stop assuming what you believe as rude to be set in stone. It\u2019s your opinion only. She was professional", ">showing an ounce of respect is expected in general society.\n\nOP did not show any disrespect. Further, s/he has demonstrated respect by stating her/his intention to make sure the pregnant employee receives the accommodations that she is due.", "[deleted]", "She took the day off, unpaid. She could\u2019ve called in and used a paid sick day, but she didn\u2019t want to waste them since we only got 3 paid sick days a year. The boss would\u2019ve insisted, due to short staffing, that she wait until the next schedule which would\u2019ve been 3 weeks later, and too late for the appointment then.\n\nShe explained all of this to us much later on when she felt comfortable talking about. She always was a very open person.", "Read my other comment. You need to do some emotional work.", "Interesting, well you know her better than I do. I guess the question that would pop into my mind if I was in your position would be \u201cwhy is she telling me, what is she expecting out of this.\u201d Maybe she was expecting some excitement if she considered you a friend as well as a manager, or at least friendly, maybe she was anxious about how the pregnancy could impact her performance. Maybe she\u2019s the kind of person who doesn\u2019t like asking for accommodations or is fearful of being overlooked for promotions if her productivity wanes if she has to take time to pump or deal with complications. I have no idea, but that\u2019s why my response would always be to try to see past the statement and try to figure out the intent. There\u2019s also nothing wrong with asking.\n\nCan I just make a suggestion? And keep in mind that even thought I disagree with how you did it, I\u2019m not trying to say you\u2019re some monster. Could you consider a follow up conversation where you express that you didn\u2019t intend to upset her but apologize if you came across as rude? You could even say something like \u201cI never know what to say in response to news like that, my mind immediately jumped to making sure I communicate to the appropriate channels so that you get every accommodation you need.\u201d\n\nFor context, I SUPER care what people think and feel about me so I\u2019m hyper attentive to that, sometimes to my detriment. I\u2019m not sure it super matters what you say as long as it communicates to her the stuff that you added in your edit. I also learned a long time ago that apologizing for how I communicated (NOT how they felt) goes a long way into smoothing things out.", "No. He said \u201cokay\u201d and didn\u2019t talk about anything else with her. So she had no idea about the accommodations because he kept it in his head. And it\u2019s disrespectful to dismiss someone who shared exciting news.", "OP responded to your charges. You have your opinion on the matter, and it is no more valid than anybody else's. Get over yourself, you don't have the final say over what is or isn't socially acceptable.", "We are in a professional work environment, I don\u2019t find the need to say things that should be a given\u2026 if this was a mom and pop shop maybe it\u2019s be different, but in this situation there\u2019s been I\u2019m sure 1000s of pregnant women, the company has policies and procedures to accommodate them."]}
