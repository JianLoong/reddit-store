She\u2019s the only grandchild on both sides of our family. She\u2019s very loved. When my sister found out she was pregnant, my daughter had a hard time sharing the attention. She gets upset when anyone talks about the baby, touches my sister\u2019s baby bump, or when they buy the new baby stuff without buying her something. \n\nI know this behavior isn\u2019t okay, but I feel like my daughter is struggling. I\u2019ve tried reading books, reassuring her, and even talking to our pediatrician. Nothing is working. \n\nMy sister is due in a few weeks, so her MIL is throwing her a baby shower. I didn\u2019t know about the baby shower until yesterday. The baby shower is Saturday. I don\u2019t have a sitter and my husband is going to be working. I have no other choice but to bring my daughter. I know she will have a bad reaction to my sister\u2019s baby being showered with gifts, so I thought about bringing her a small gift to unwrap during the shower. I don\u2019t think my sister will be upset, but I don\u2019t know about her wife. My SIL often gets frustrated with me about how my daughter acts. I understand her frustration, but I\u2019m trying. I think my daughter will act better once the baby is born and she has a cousin to play with, but for now I\u2019m just trying to survive. \n\nWIBTA here?", "created_utc": 1682628141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1316229/wibta_if_i_brought_my_daughter_a_present_to_my/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sure you do. The other choice is staying home and sending a gift.", "Yes YWBTA. Your daughter is eight years old. She's too old to throw a fit because she's not the center of attention. If she can't behave without you babying her at someone else's celebration, stay home.", "The whole shower will be about the baby. One gift isn't going to make your daughter behave. You should just stay home and keep your daughter with you. Otherwise, she's going to expect a gift every time there's a special occasion for the baby. YTA", "YTA. This is not acceptable behavior. Your daughter is behaving like this because you\u2019re enabling it. Knock it off.", "YWBTA. I'm frustrated with how your daughter acts just reading this. Discuss it with your sister before doing anything.", "YWBTA \n\nTime for your kid to face the facts, not everything is about her. There is a new grandchild on the way and you cannot allow her to behave like this. Time to start looking into therapy for your daughter.", "Yes, YWBTA.  Get a babysitter for your kid.  And find a psychologist that works with young children.  Now!", "YWBTA, absolutely. TBH if your daughter isn't okay with people simply talking about the baby, I do not see her behaving remotely acceptable at a party centered around said baby. You'd also be the AH if you brought her. If you can't find a sitter, it might be best to sit the shower out, tbh. Bc if your daughter causes a scene, she could potentially ruin what's supposed to be a beautiful day for your sister. It's your sister and her wifes day, do not enable your daugher by bringing her a gift.\n\nMy mom would give my sister a gift every year on MY BIRTHDAY. That same sister once fractured my tailbone, ON MY BIRTHDAY, trying to steal the money I had received. That same sister also stabbed me with a steak knife in the hand, on my birthday, another year. It would have went into my eyeball had I not thrown my hand up to protect myself. This is what happens when you enable that behavior.", "She's been spoiled for 8 years. She has been given ZERO tools for coping with jealousy for 8+ months. You are planning to cater to her bratty behavior instead of setting boundaries.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nWhat if you took her shopping to choose a gift for *her* to give to the baby? \n\nBut honestly, what if instead of trying to distract or soothe or placate your daughter, you just listened to her feelings and empathized and let her feel what she feels? This baby is a reality she's going to have to face and I would think that having the adults around her walking on eggshells every time it's mentioned must be adding a lot of stress and tension to the situation.", "YTA and you are on the path to creating an absolute monster.", "YWBTA \n\nYour daughter needs to learn the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her and by playing into it you\u2019ll just be adding to the issue.", "YTA - If you know your daughter will act out and you don't have \\*anyone\\* in your life who can watch her (is your kid so awful she doesn't even have friends she can have a playdate with during that time? honestly I wouldn't be shocked given the behavior you've explained in this post) you just shouldn't attend this event, and if people ask why you've gotta be honest.", "Info:  Has your daughter never been to a birthday party before.....or are you that parent who brings a gift for your daughter to open during other kids parties too?", "YWBTA.  I know you\u2019re doing it out of love, but our jobs as parents are to develop, not to be friends with our kids.  8 years old is plenty old enough to learn to share affection, and I shudder to think of who that child grows up into if they don\u2019t learn it.", "YWBTA. If you are letting an 8 year old run your life now it will only get worse. Your job isn't to make your kids life \"easy\" but to help prepare them for the rest of their life, which most certainly won't be easy.", "Ywbth your daughter is going to have to come to terms about the baby. Buying her a present isn\u2019t helping anyone. And yes your sil and your sister would have every right to be mad at this.  \n\nI would suggest finding a babysitter. Leaving the shower early.\n\nOr if you think your daughter is going to have a tantrum about your sister and the baby getting all the attention then don\u2019t go. Being absent is better then stealing you sister and sil spotlight or ruining their shower.\n\n\nAnd anyone else think it was an accident that she just found out 3 days before the shower? To me it feels like maybe they didn\u2019t want to invite op and niece for fear neice would ruin the shower. It kinda feels like someone spilled the beans and they had no other choice to invite or sister sudden felt guilty. But I don\u2019t believe this shower wasn\u2019t planned way in advanced not just 3 days ago.", "YWBTA\n\nKeep her home until she can behave. This is your problem, keep her and her jealousy  at home.", "YWBTA and you absolutely have a choice here. Your whole post of asking if YTA if you bring a gift for your poorly behaved jealous uninvited child, instead of if YTA for putting your sister first & missing the shower to stay home with your child, reeks of your entitlement. No wonder your kid acts the way she does. Try harder to find a sitter or don\u2019t go. If your 8 yo is such a spoiled brat that she will cause drama, she should definitely not attend.", "YTA.  Don't go to the shower then. \n\nThis event isn't about you or your daughter.  And she's not going to be getting a playmate.  There's an 8-year difference between them. This is not going to get better because your daughter is spoiled.", "YWBTA. Totally.\n\nYour daughter needs to learn the world does not revolve around her. \n\nI wonder if they were trying to exclude you from the shower? Howcome you only found out now?", "The more tantrums you prevent by appeasing your daughter, the more tantrums she will throw. You are teaching her and rewarding bad behavior. This will not end unless you stop giving into her and making it clear it is unacceptable. YWBTA.", "YWBTA - YTA - Stop. Your solution is the pits. She's like this because 8+ years she was not guided well so you are reaping what you've sown.\n\nChildren need to learn empathy and facts like, \"I'm not the center of attention.\" It not normal for a non-sibling to be given a gift during someone's baby shower. You are the ahole for creating this solution. You did not share how you are coaching her to understand this concept.  You are just trying to survive? Stay home if this is so stressful and how did you not know the correct date?", "DO NOT DO THIS. It sets a terrible precedent. Will your daughter be expecting presents at her cousin\u2019s future birthdays too? Don\u2019t be one of *those* parents. \n\nYou won\u2019t be doing your daughter any favors. In fact, you\u2019d be doing her a disservice (as most people don\u2019t like it when others behave in such an entitled fashion).", "If you bring a gift for her she'll expect a gift every time that baby has a birthday party. This is a good chance to teach her that it's not all about her.\n\nYWBTA", "YTA. You know this is an issue and you're actively enabling it if you go through with this idea. Get a sitter, send a gift and don't attend, or the second your daughter starts to act up leave and explain to her that if she can't let other people be important too then she can't be at their celebrations.", "YWBTA\n\nTime to be a parent and teach your kid she's not the center of the universe. Hire a sitter for your daughter if you don't think you can control the situation otherwise.", "Yes YWBTA\n\nYou are off to a good start raising a spoiled entitled child.", ">I know this behavior isn\u2019t okay, but I feel like my daughter is struggling.\n\nSo you decided to encourage her behavior.....?\n\nYTA", "YWBTA!!!! You are encouraging anti- social behavior by rewarding your little entitled,  selfish grandkid. I was the only grandkid for a long time and was never made to feel like I was a commodity.  UGH!", "YTA. Please don't reward bad behavior. I know you fear her making a scene etc. Perhaps spend your money on a sitter instead of a present ... and don't take her to the shower.", "Eight?! Yes, you would be the asshole. Wtf. Raising an entitled brat is what you're doing. Good grief, the fact that she is 8 and you are even considering this is pathetic.", "YWBTA  your daughter is acting very selfish and spoilt and by the sounds of it you're only encouraging it. \nDon't give her a gift just because, how many times do you do that? Maybe you need to think about how to reprimand bad behaviour instead of rewarding it", "YTA. You're raising a Princess. It will get worse. Time to work on not the only child. Things are changing. For the record 8 years older nothing in common with baby/toddler. What kind of play. She'll be a teenager by then. Just in time to be a babysitter.", "YWBTA, but if you are reading the replies, you probably have guessed that by now.  \nTime to fix this before it becomes a bigger problem for everyone. Unless raising a selfish, entitled monster is your goal.", "YWBTA - a tantrum seems inevitable whether she gets a gift or not. Best to sit this one out and let the mother to be enjoy her day.", "YTA\n\nI understand your daughter is having a hard time sharing attention but bringing her a gift to an event that has nothing to do with her is only gonna instill the mindset that every celebration needs to be about her.", "YTA, it sounds like you might have a problem with another baby in the family too", "YTA. You\u2019re supposed to be raising a functioning member of society. That\u2019s not who you are describing. I think you need less excuses and more parenting. Good luck.", "YWBTA, you're hurting your daughter in the long run. Life doesn't work like that.\n\nLet me share my story, Since the day I was born I had a favorite aunt and I was her favorite niece. We were 2 peas in a pod and I could see the sun through her eyes. Suddenly she gets married (I might have been 7 or 8 at the time), I was not happy about it but I dealt with it; not that I was given any options though lol. OK, I was finally making peace with the idea of sharing her with her husband, when couple of years later she gets pregnant with her 1st daughter. I was beyond mad, but nobody paid much attention to it. My great aunt took me to the hospital to meet \"my new cousin\", if eyes were daggers she would have been dead right on the spot. Jealousy to the max expression.  I distanced myself from them for about 2 years, then one day I was close to her house, and I decided to stop and say hello. The most adorable little girl opened the door (until this day over 30 years later, nobody knows how she did, no nanny, no aunt, no uncle and not overprotective big Airedale terrier were around). From that day forward I adored her. Growing up she sued to ask me \"tell me again the story when you began to love me\".\n\nSo you see? this too shall pass. Either you find a babysitter, or you excuse yourself from the baby shower. Do not bring her along, she will ruin your sister special day, and your daughter would end up hating her cousin even more.", "YWBTA you need to set boundaries with your daughter before you arrive. Shes 8, tell her before you even leave the house the behavior you expect of her, and if she doesn't follow your expectations then what the consequences will be, and if she doesn't listen FOLLOW THROUGH.", "**YTA**  The last thing you want to do is reinforce your daughter's jealousy about another child receiving attention.    Pretty soon your family is going to be writing posts about how your daughter always has to steal the spotlight at every family event-- which she probably already does but you dismiss it as \"she's just a child\"-- and always getting gifts for other people's milestones.\n\nIf your daughter is having \"bad reactions\" now, it will get much worse when the baby actually arrives.   Instead of spending money on gifts, get her some sessions with a child therapist.", "i don't know about an AH, but it would be a bad idea. don't bring her a gift, but do bring her something to do, like an activity bag or coloring book. don't set up the expectation that her cousin can't be celebrated and have gifts without the same treatment for her.", "Yes of course YTA. You already are by tolerating this behaviour at all. Get a babysitter and maybe put her in therapy while you\u2019re at it.", "YTA.\n\nIf you give her a present to open at her aunt\u2019s baby shower, you\u2019re setting a precedent that her poor behavior in relation to her cousin results in a reward. You\u2019re going to set an expectation that your daughter will be given presents on every special occasion meant to celebrate your cousin. \n\nEight years old is *beyond* old enough to understand that there are times, places, and events that won\u2019t be about her and it is *beyond* shitty to consider hijacking your sister\u2019s baby shower to placate your own child. \n\nIf your daughter is struggling this much with adapting to having to share the spotlight, you need to make an appointment with a child psychologist.", "YWBTA she's 8, she need to learn that she's not always going to be the centre of attention. Your sister's baby shower should be totally about her and her baby. If that's going to be a problem then either find a babysitter or don't go.", "YWBTA I get that it's hard, but this will get so much worse as she gets older if you don't correct the behavior now. Maybe try involving her as a \"helper\" at the shower. She still gets attention, but in a socially acceptable way. (Ie: passing out the papers and pens for baby shower games). Good luck and congrats to your sister!", "YWBTA. You need to teach your daughter that she won\u2019t always be the center of attention. Imagine if someone insisted on opening their present at your daughter\u2019s party and how she would react.", "Please don't bring your daughter to a baby-shower where she is sure to behave badly and detract from your sister's experience and everyone else's as well. You already know that you won't be able to focus on honoring your sister. Give her the gift of a lovely celebratory party... by staying home.", "No\u2026 do not bring a gift. Maybe instead ask her to help at the shower by gathering all the bows and making a flower out of them. Or find a sitter if she\u2019s really going to be that upset about another baby coming in to the family.", "YWBTA you would only be rewarding her for her bad behavior. She won\u2019t be number one in everything in life and at 8, she should have a good understanding of this. This would be a good opportunity for her to learn how to deal with that. If she can\u2019t take it, then she can sit and sulk by herself, but don\u2019t baby her anymore.", "YWBTA Your daughter is old enough to know better than to act this way, and keep it up for months. Bringing her a gift will be indulging her bad behavior. It won\u2019t help her in the long run.", "YTA    either get a sitter or stay home.  Thi day is about the couple and the new baby arriving soon.\nOther kids are great  and love being given little \"jobs\".....hand the presents to mom to open,  hand out pencils and paper f there are games to play,", "YTA\n\nEight years old is plenty old enough to understand the that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you.", "Good god in heaven please do not DO THIS. Please. This is the worst way you can handle this. You tell her to behave herself and no pouting or there will be consequences.", "YWBTA. You've coddled your daughter. If she misbehaves during the shower then she will have to face real consequences. Time to start punishing bad behaviour not rewarding it with gifts.", "This sounds like a really frustrating time for everyone involved, including you. I get it breaks your heart to see your daughter struggling but she's 8 years old. That's old enough to understand and learn to share.\n\nIt will be tough because you guys have pampered her for eight years, but bringing a gift will not help with her overall conduct, so YWBTA I think.\n\nMaybe get a babysitter? Or talk to her before going and explain that if she throws a tantrum you guys will leave the party early (and follow through), help her learn that sharing the attention is not a bad thing.\n\nGood luck!", "YTA. Your daughter is not the honouree. Do what you want at home.", "Yes YWBTA. Your child is behaving like a brat. (I\u2019m not saying she is a brat - but this behavior is bratty.). Shut it down. If you can\u2019t shut it down, don\u2019t take her. If you can\u2019t leave her, then you don\u2019t go either. Explain to her exactly why.", "Am I the only one with concerns about the infant\u2019s safety around this child?", "Definitely YTA. You\u2019re just enabling your daughter to be a spoiled brat.

If you didn\u2019t find out until the last minute and can\u2019t find a sitter, wouldn\u2019t your family know that would be likely?

That\u2019s how life works.", "YTA. It's not fair to the expectant mom to have to accommodate your daughter at an event to celebrate the arrival of her new baby. The sooner she learns that she can't be the center of everything, the better. No different than asking if your daughter should receive a gift for someone's wedding or graduation. If you feel that she will have difficulty, she should not come.  And by the way, she will not get better after baby is born.", "YWBTA. She's 8. That's plenty old enough to realize that the world doesn't revolve around her.", "I want to add that your daughter's jealousy and volatile behaviour mean that she should very closely watched once the baby is born. Please do not let your innocent nibbling become the victim to her hatred by allowing any opportunities for abuse.", "YWBTA she\u2019s 8. She\u2019s perfectly capable of understanding what is going on. Yes it\u2019s ok for her to be a bit upset but you need to sit her down and explain that everyone still loves her but a new baby is exciting and everyone is excited and that\u2019s ok because that\u2019s how everyone was she was born.", "So, your daughter (who is more than old enough to know better) has a tantrum whenever she's not the centre of attention and you've tried to resolve this by giving her more attention, giving her more attention and giving her more attention...and now you're wondering whether you should try to fix this by giving her more attention?\n\nYWBTA. You need to parent her, not pander to her.", "Yes. YWBTA. You gonna do this at birthday parties, too? Start (well, kinda) as you mean to go on from here. It\u2019s time she learns that we have to share and it\u2019s part of the gig. 8 is plenty old enough to understand the world as a whole doesn\u2019t revolve around her and you\u2019re being ridiculous by letting her think it does.", "YTA.. your daughter isn\u2019t \u201cloved\u201d she\u2019s spoiled rotten. My 2 year olds wouldn\u2019t even behave like this.. honestly, if you can\u2019t find a sitter, I just wouldn\u2019t go.. nobody wants a bratty kid ruining their party", "Of course YTA.", "YTA", "YWBTA and taking the easy route in parenting. If you continue to allow and reward with this behavior, it will only get worse. \n\nEither find a babysitter or sit out the baby shower, your sister deserves the opportunity to celebrate her child with her wife and have the spotlight all to themselves. \n\nIt just won\u2019t be all about your daughter and the sooner you help her accept that the sooner family functions will become enjoyable again.", "It is not going to get better when the cousin comes. On birthdays she is going to blow out their candles or throw tantrums because they did not get any. You are doing your child a disservice by enabling her bad behavior. This is a bad parenting thought and should remain just that, a thought. You need to be taking these instances and using them as teaching tools to tell your child that not everything is always going to be about them.", "INFO why on earth do you think it will be better when the baby is born?

Will you be buying her presents for the other kids bday too? It's time for her to learn to share the spotlight and that not everything is about her. I had a cousin who's parent got her presents for everyone else's bday ect. She was a hot mess of a brat until she was about 15/16.", "YTA!!\n\n\nShe's far too old to be behaving like that.\nYou're setting yourself up for years of turmoil if you pander to it. I mean, do you plan on having more kids? \n\nYou should emphasise on her role in the baby's life. Take her to choose a gift for the baby. Drive home how she'll be a big sister and protector of her little cousin. \n\nI'm sure once she sees the baby, she'll fall in love.\nHowever, if you start pandering to her jealousy, you'll further reinforce that she has 'competition' for everyones' affection.", "YWBTA. I know that it's hard, but this is the time to step up and be a parent. I would probably not bring her at all if I were you, and this is going to have to be something you continue to work on with her. Realize that if you let this sit without addressing it head on and sticking to it you will be raising a narcissist. At some point you need to stop reassuring her and make it clear that it's not acceptable to get upset when someone else gets a present. Emotional regulation is a hard won skill but it's one of the most important for a child to learn.", "YTA - \n\nYou need to just stay home.  I see your trying but what you are trying.  If you don't have it in you to use a very heavy hand and put a stop to your daughter's abhorrent behavior just stay home.  \n\nIt's okay to take space and deal with this problem but you first have to understand that this attitude of hers will run though all things, you need to spend the next few months showing her she can't get her way, there are little things you can do like not allowing her to pick out her cloths but chose her hair style for school each day or cooking things that she's never tried or saying no to outings or treats, little subtle ways of showing her it's not all about her, but very gently", "Why exactly do you think your daughter will \"act better once the baby is born\" if you continue to reward her inappropriate behavior?

Eight is too old to be behaving like this, she must be Veruca Salt levels of spoiled.", "I didn't know about the baby shower until yesterday...\n\nNo one wanted you to bring your daughter to the event and someone either tripped up or felt guilty for you but YWBTA have your mom come pick up the gift you were gonna take and make it a point to your daughter that her and YOU will be missing this important family event because she can't behave herself maybe if she sees that you are still trying to participate and so is the whole family including grandma she will think about her actions and change them, if not tell her and your family that you and your daughter will no longer be attending family events until she can learn that her behavior isn't going to be rewarded.", "YWBTA. Don't take your daughter to the baby shower, she will have a screaming hissy fit. Even if that means just sending your present with your apologies. It's interesting that you think she will be ok when the baby arrives, but what (other than hope and crossing your fingers) makes you think that? How do you know she won't have a violent reaction? I'd be extremely cautious about not leaving her alone with the baby when it arrives or you may be having to explain little \"accidents\" or even worse! Get her to see a child therapist ASAP.", "Ywbta for coddling your child's tantrum at no longer being  the doted upon one.

This is okay if she was like 2 and even then barely. She\u2019s 8 this was an issue you needed fixed about 5 years ago.", "Ywbta. Your daughter is far, far too old for this behaviour and you would be enabling and rewarding it. Does she pitch a for at other kids birthdays? (Does she even get invited to other kids birthdays?)", "YWBTA if you gave her the gift DURING the shower. Give something after if you must give her something. Don't do it during, as you\n\n1. would only further cement the bad behavior\n2. would take the focus away from your Sis, who is the focus of the party\n3. She's 8 years old. She needs to learn that not everything is going to be about her. Kids typically learn this much earlier.\n\nIf she's going to act up, perhaps consider leaving at the first sign (again, see steps 1-3 again).", "Ywbta if you don't first talk to your sister, and see what she would prefer. Offer to a) do as you've suggested *if* she and her wife are on with it, b) swing by with a gift and well wishes, but not stay in order to avoid a melt down from daughter, or c) attend but leave immediately if daughter misbehaves. And obviously, if you go with c), talk to your daughter before hand and explain that her getting worked up is not on and you will both need to leave should smher emotions overwhelm her. I presume you're also looking into ways to help her manage big emotions, it's something adults can struggle with as well!!", "I would recommend taking her to a child psychologist. My sister acted like this before I was born. She resented me and it took therapy for her to help get over that feeling of resentment.", "YWBTA. this is your time to guide your daughter and teach her what is and is not okay. its absolutely unreasonable that she throws fits over other people paying attention to your sisters baby bump or buying her presents. I know you think this behavior will resolve once the baby is born, but it will not. it will almost certainly get worse.", "I think you need to ask them both - your sister and SIL- about what you would like to do. \n\nI want to call you an AH, but honestly you seem to be very clear that this isn't okay and your daughter is not a precious princess who should never not be the center of attention, you are just a parent dealing with bad behavior, as all parents have to deal with at some point. \n\nIt also sounds like you are trying to deal with the problem. So you recognize this isn't right, and you are trying to fix it, and it isn't going to go away right away. And, she isn't the first child to have these feelings, so she isn't a monster, just a kid. \n\nSo, I am going to say NAH, so long as you speak to your wife and SIL and be as frank and honest as you were here: My daughter is being a little shit. I know it and I am sorry, and I am doing X, Y, Z to deal with it. I can also understand why this happened- only kid for 8 years- but I am not in any way excusing her behavior. I wouldn't take her to the baby shower if I could, because this is your day, but of course I would like to be there to celebrate. I anticipate she is going to have a meltdown, so my options are: We don't come at all, I bring a present for her to have a moment of attention and only use it if/when she acts up, I don't bring a present and leave as soon as a meltdown starts, or I stay and try and deal with the meltdown in another room. \n\nBe clear that  this decision is up to them, and they can think about it and of course even change their mind. They are about to be parents, they are going to have their own hard moments, and this is also their day. You are happy to stay home but want them to know how happy you are for them and wanted to be there, you can leave when a meltdown starts (again, sorry, you love them), or you can do this present idea.

She\u2019s the only grandchild on both sides of our family. She\u2019s very loved. When my sister found out she was pregnant, my daughter had a hard time sharing the attention. She gets upset when anyone talks about the baby, touches my sister\u2019s baby bump, or when they buy the new baby stuff without buying her something. \n\nI know this behavior isn\u2019t okay, but I feel like my daughter is struggling. I\u2019ve tried reading books, reassuring her, and even talking to our pediatrician. Nothing is working. \n\nMy sister is due in a few weeks, so her MIL is throwing her a baby shower. I didn\u2019t know about the baby shower until yesterday. The baby shower is Saturday. I don\u2019t have a sitter and my husband is going to be working. I have no other choice but to bring my daughter. I know she will have a bad reaction to my sister\u2019s baby being showered with gifts, so I thought about bringing her a small gift to unwrap during the shower. I don\u2019t think my sister will be upset, but I don\u2019t know about her wife. My SIL often gets frustrated with me about how my daughter acts. I understand her frustration, but I\u2019m trying. I think my daughter will act better once the baby is born and she has a cousin to play with, but for now I\u2019m just trying to survive. \n\nWIBTA here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s hard to watch our kids hurt. I don\u2019t think giving a gift is the right way to help her cope. Not only does it reinforce bad behavior, but it also teaches her that she has to have someone buy you stuff when she\u2019s having a hard time emotionally. Gift giving is not helping her work through these very big feelings. \n\nIs there something that she could do to help at the shower?

What do you think new baby would do if they saw a snake? If we ever saw a snake by new baby, we could handle it, right? Because we aren\u2019t little babies. We\u2019re big!

She was willing to forgo a special moment in order not to listen to a 8yr old throw a tantrum over not getting a gift or being center of attention. \n\nShe is EIGHT. She's not two and unable to understand more complex emotions and situations.\n\nBe a parent. Stop enabling her crap, set her straight or don't go and send a gift ONLY for the new baby.\n\nYou need to send her to a therapist if she's acting like this so much. It ain't healthy or normal. This main character syndrome needs to be ended. Now. Before you become the aunt that's never around.\n\nAlso. Do you plan on getting your daughter a gift for EVERY occasion that the baby gets a gift? Their first birthday? Any religious occasions that include gifts? Like where's the line? Or are you going to raise her to be entitled and Bratty? You really don't want a 16yr old who is acting like this. \n\nTime to grow up, parent the kid and apologize to your sister for not stopping this crap sooner.\n\nAlso fyi the fact she gets upset and throws a tantrum over people feeling the baby kick is highly concerning. Like highly. That ain't normal behavior. At all.\n\nDo better. Be a better parent for your kids sake.", "YTA  You are not trying at all, stop kidding yourself.

And you can acknowledge her feelings about things changing, and that it\u2019s okay to feel those feelings. But it\u2019s also important to express those feelings in appropriate ways at appropriate times. \n\nI think that it\u2019s not a bad idea to gift a little something to keep her occupied at the shower, but before the shower. If she\u2019s into drawing, maybe a nice art pad with special color pencils or markers. If she\u2019s into Roblox, a gift card to do the paid stuff there. Arts and crafts kit? Book? The point would be something that could occupy her, and help her feel special without making her the center of attention. \n\nIf the entire family has spent her entire life making her the center of attention, then the entire family needs to help her adjust. It\u2019s not fair to her to just expect her to snap out of it because she\u2019s older. She\u2019s still a child. But, you can expect her to adjust.

That kid sounds like a monster.", "\ud83e\udd23", "Very real possibility. I\u2019m just not jumping to conclusions. \n\nI know my daughter\u2019s behavior is bad. I really do. I\u2019m not trying to defend it. I\u2019ve tried reading up on how to fix this kind of behavior, and I talked to her pediatrician about it. I\u2019m genuinely trying to find a solution to this problem. The only reason I was considering bringing a gift was to keep her from throwing a tantrum.", "I was answering to why I only found out now.", "It\u2019s not a personal attack if your kid IS a brat\u2026 which everything you\u2019ve written strongly suggests she is. \n\nYWBTA. Don\u2019t go to the shower if you have to take your jealous child.", "Oh, boy.  You\u2019re a real piece of work. The kid IS a brat and you are not \u201cparenting.\u201d  You have raised the kid to be a brat.  Own it.", "And there is the problem. You are treating her like she is 2 and needs to be protected from the consequences of her actions. She is 8. She is more than old enough to be held responsible for her behaviour, and it is you and your husbands job to teach her that. What is it you do, to parent her, when she has these tantrums ? Because it sounds like your SIL doesn\u2019t want you around because she doesn\u2019t see you actually doing anything to correct your daughters behaviour. Seriously, a gift ? You basically want to reward her for acting like a spoiled brat. Instead, make her do the dishes and all the clean up after the party. If she refuses, take away screen time and electronics for the week. If she still refuses, double her chores for a week. If she has no chores, she needs some to teach her responsibility. Still refuses, she can spend a couple weekends picking up garbage at a local park so she learns how to do something nice for other people.", "Its is personal, but its also descriptive and all words that describe a persons behavior are going to be personal cause DUH!\n\nAnd it is very apt description of your daughters behavior. And you're the one enabling this behavior. \n\nIf you seriously believe that your daughters behavior will change after her cousin is born, you are delusional!  It will likely get worse as everyone gushes over the new born. \n\nWhat are you going to do when you take your daughter to your niblings birthdays - buy her presents, insist on having a second cake.\n\nYou need to get a handle on this now.  **Don't** take your daughter to the shower, skip the shower if you have to. If you do skip it - be truthful with your sister why", "Then stop enabling her bad behaviour. You are turning your child into a brat with your parenting because you try and keep her happy at all costs, to the detriment of others. You would prefer to reward her bad behaviour (tantrums) with a toy, than discipline her so the behaviour does not become a pattern.", "Your child sounds like the type to attack a baby. Please keep her away", "I agree. That\u2019s absolutely uncalled for. You\u2019re accepting the judgment here graciously (so few do) and being unnecessarily combative accomplishes nothing.", "Genuine question, why would it matter if my SIL told her mother? The baby shower is about the pregnant woman: My sister.", "Love the Harry Potter reference!!", "Of course not. It\u2019s easier to shrug her shoulders and say \u201coh well, I tried\u201d than it is to potentially be the mean mom who doesn\u2019t give in to tantrums", "She needs a child psychologist to help her work through her issues, not presents at an event that\u2019s not for her. OP stated, in the post, that she\u2019s *already* tried having conversations with her about it and was unsuccessful, so this \u201ctoken\u201d gift isn\u2019t going to do anything except set an expectation that she gets presents whenever her cousin has a life event.\n\nThis event isn\u2019t about her, plain and simple. She doesn\u2019t need a role - she needs therapy.", "I mean..sister doesn't seem too excited to have OP attend, considering she just \"found out\" about the shower, and it's only a few days away. Interesting choice of words, imo. \"Found out\" and \"invited\" can mean very different things. Showers also generally include select important females in the recipient's life to help organize. Very telling that OP wasn't included..", "But by giving her a gift, you\u2019re reinforcing the idea that she gets to behave badly and will essentially be rewarded for it. Why would she start to behave? There\u2019s no incentive. \n\nI understand you\u2019re trying, and acknowledging that her behavior is a problem, but it\u2019s been months and things aren\u2019t getting better. Frankly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be better once baby is here, and the logic that she\u2019ll have a cousin to play with is sweet, but it\u2019ll be a while before baby is able to play on a level an 8+ year old will enjoy. \n\nGet a recommendation for a child psychologist and quickly, because baby is coming soon.", "DO NOT GO TO THE SHOWER!\n\nI can\u2019t understand how you don\u2019t know this.", "While it is admirable, that you are seeking to fix it yourself, you simply may not be able to. This is where you need to find a behavior therapist.", "Take her to a child therapist or phycologist not a pediatrician. If you don't intervene now with the big guns this stuff will only get worse. And assuming she'll be better after the baby is born is a mistake. Jealousy like this doesn't just disappear or get better after reading books.", "Trying to be helpful - what do you do now when she acts jealous and what is the actual trigger?", "I wouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions.  And honestly bring the gift if it\u2019s to this point may make things worse.\n\nThe only thing you can do now is fix the issue. Do what it takes. Even if that means you distance her away from all baby things until you figure it out.\n\nHowever if you do decide to go. I would have a contact with daughter and say that big cousin are big girls. And we big girls get special privileges. If you go to the shower with mom and do not make a fuss or throw a tantrum. Mommy will take you and get a pedicure, or what ever your daughter loves, after the baby shower.\n\nThis would be rewarding good behavior. Where as buying a gift looks bad and attention seeking and it also reinforces bad behavior.\n\nI had a person tell me my kids where the best behaved kids he ever seen. I laughed an said no they are just will bribed. I didn\u2019t reward bad behavior but if you went and where on your best behavior I had no problem rewarding that", "Is your kid an only child or just the baby of all the cousins?\n\nIf she's an only child this something you needed to address long ago. As an only child myself my mother made sure there was difference between spoiling and just giving me luxuries. This is something you need to make sure you child understands and she's not too old to get the gist of this lesson.\n\nYou empathize that yeah it'll be hard that now the baby will grab everyone's attention especially when they're a baby and toddler but that doesn't mean this behavior is acceptable. She had her time in the limelight now it's time to share it. She'll still have attention too when she has her big moments like sweet 16 and other such milestones where she will be the main focus so the attention isn't going all away. Also it's not like the baby is her future sibling so she'll still be \\#1 kid at home. When she misbehaves privileges get taken away and you go home.", "you must not have kids, huh? the child is definitely acting in a problematic way, yes. but the mom here asked the question, accepted the judgment, and is *actively* seeking out professionals to help with this. \n\nthere are so many people who write in to AITA and really don\u2019t parent their kids competently. this mom a.) asked the question and didn\u2019t assume her little angel would be everyone\u2019s delight, b.) knows this is a problem and is trying hard to resolve it, and c.) isn\u2019t arguing about every little thing here. \n\nyou have some anger to manage.", "Like seriously, bad seed or good son vibes here yeesh", "The point the commenter is trying to make is that MIL and SIL don\u2019t want you there.  You\u2019re really tone deaf.", "And yet you have to make it about your daughter", "It would be the reason it was last minute and you just found out about it.\n\nI honestly am not trying to be mean. But if your daughters behavior is as bad as you say they may have been trying to keep you from going making it last minute.\n\nLike I said I am not trying to hurt your feelings. But you need to realize this isn\u2019t healthy behavior for an eight year old. If your sister is about to give birth she should have already adjusted somewhat.\n\nMy worry is she is 8 and doesn\u2019t realize what could or couldn\u2019t hurt a newborn. What if she lashes out and hurt the baby. This is something no one want\u2019s especially you.\n\nAnd o don\u2019t know what your plans are but what if you have a child. This issue needs to be addressed. This isn\u2019t something you can buy her make it better. This is going to take some work.\n\nI am sure the last thing you want is your family avoiding her. And it definitely would not help her if that happens.", "You think your sister hasn't talked about what a terror your daughter is?\n\nI'll bet you all the money in my change jar the reason you're just hearing about the shower now is because YOU WEREN'T INVITED.", "Disagree. This may be a cultural thing, but to me the baby shower is about the couple - it's a celebration of the impending change to their life. It's quite common where I live for a baby shower to include all genders, it's certainly not just a female thing, and not just about the birthing parent.", "It fits lmao, my cousin parents like OP but a little more extreme. She encouraged her kids to blow out other peoples candles on their birthdays without their consent.. Her kids had to be caught and held before they could get to the cake\u2026 Both kids would scream and cry afterwards. \n\nWhen we hosted my baby nibblings first birthday, I was dreading the very idea of my cousin and her kids coming cause of it. They also do not know how to be gentle and will push a baby around if they don\u2019t have their way, and they will treat baby\u2019s like dolls.", "The sister likely isn\u2019t planning her own baby shower.", "You\u2019re right. I don\u2019t have kids - lucky guess for you. I do come from a big family, and a huge, tightly knit extended family.  Scores of nieces, nephews and greats.  None of them are brats.  \n\nMore important, I am lawyer who spent my entire career working with adult criminals and juvenile offenders.  I\u2019ve worked with more social workers and psychologists than you could imagine.  On top of that, my husband is a clinical psychologist who has worked with parents who have kids like OP\u2019s\n\nI know what bad parenting looks like and where kids can end up as a result.  And I don\u2019t chime in on posts unless I have first hand knowledge of the issues.  \n\nFinally, I must have missed the part where OP is actively seeking professionals.  The only comments she responded to are ones that offer bone-headed advice.", "\ud83e\udd23", "I understand that, but the baby shower isn\u2019t about them. The baby shower is for the pregnant woman. Most partners don\u2019t even attend baby showers.", "Yes, it\u2019s about your sister. Therefore, don\u2019t take your 8 year old into a situation that will trigger her and take focus away from your sister. How do you not understand that?\n\nFrom your replies, I\u2019m starting to understand why your child is reacting the way she is.", ">> the baby shower isn\u2019t about them\n\nIt\u2019s also not about *you* or your daughter, although you seem to think that diverting the attention from the pregnant woman to your daughter is acceptable. Do you see the hypocrisy here?", "You keep saying it\u2019s not about the in-laws.  That\u2019s a dismissive attitude.  They are hosting the shower and will have to endure the presence of an insufferable child.   Why don\u2019t you entertain the idea of staying home and sending a present?  As for partners\u2026.  I don\u2019t know where you live, but \nI have not been to a women only shower for more than 20 years.  The trend is toward showers that include men.", "Just don\u2019t go and honestly, learn to parent your kid.", "But you want to make it about your precious daughter...", "Well it\u2019s far more about your SIL than it is you or your daughter. I\u2019m surprised you are invited.", "30 years ago my husband went with me. And he helped open gifts too. This day and time coed baby showers are just  as common as traditional. And I honestly think that\u2019s a great thing.\n\nPlus not being mean the shower may not be about your sisters mil. \n\nBut the shower is about the mother and baby. This baby happens to have 2 mothers. Only one maybe carrying the baby but don\u2019t lessen the fact your sil is very much this baby\u2019s mother also. This is very much her shower as it is your sister. Taken that away from her when things with her and your daughter are tense is only going to make things so much worse.", "I don\u2019t think the baby shower is about me or my daughter. The only reason I would bring anything for my daughter is to keep her from ruining the mood at my sister\u2019s shower by distracting her.", "If she\u2019s not capable of behaving, or if her behavior will ruin the shower, she needs to not attend. If that means you don\u2019t attend, so be it. Plying her with presents in hopes she behaves is how children end up entitled and self-centered.", "If you can't parent your child, don't go or arrange child care to go. Don't take your child and let her become the center of attention.", "Or just step up and parent your fucking kid. You're going to raise an entitled brat if this is behavior you want to reward or think they need gifts to be decent and civil.", "What consequences do you give your daughter for bad behaviour? Or does she hold all the power in your dynamic and you constantly try and placate her rather than parent her?", "Enabling your daughters behaviour to distract her isn\u2019t the way to go, honestly you should listen to commenters here and just. Stay. Home. \n\nYour daughter isn\u2019t capable of behaving at your sisters baby shower, and having a ticking time bomb there is only going to stress her, her spouse and the host out.", "And so what happens then is your daughter gets *one* present and no attention, while your sister and SIL get many presents and all the attention, and the mere single present is insufficient to divert your child for more than five minutes. And then what? You'll have reinforced the bad behavior and you'll still have to leave.\n\nYou have to start really handling this now, or your child will be abusive to your niece or nephew. You really have to take care of it before an innocent is brought into the situation.", "Sounds like the kid is already entitled and self centered.", "Yeah that seems to be the most obvious and easiest answer. Suddenly OP has fallen silent though", "I don\u2019t believe in spanking or hitting, so I mainly use time out. Since she\u2019s eight, she stays in time out for eight minutes then we talk about why she went in time out. She has to be able to communicate why she did what she did, and she has to be able to understand why her behavior was wrong. If you have any other disciplinary actions that you think could work here I\u2019m willing to give anything a try."]}
