She\u2019s the only grandchild on both sides of our family. She\u2019s very loved. When my sister found out she was pregnant, my daughter had a hard time sharing the attention. She gets upset when anyone talks about the baby, touches my sister\u2019s baby bump, or when they buy the new baby stuff without buying her something. \n\nI know this behavior isn\u2019t okay, but I feel like my daughter is struggling. I\u2019ve tried reading books, reassuring her, and even talking to our pediatrician. Nothing is working. \n\nMy sister is due in a few weeks, so her MIL is throwing her a baby shower. I didn\u2019t know about the baby shower until yesterday. The baby shower is Saturday. I don\u2019t have a sitter and my husband is going to be working. I have no other choice but to bring my daughter. I know she will have a bad reaction to my sister\u2019s baby being showered with gifts, so I thought about bringing her a small gift to unwrap during the shower. I don\u2019t think my sister will be upset, but I don\u2019t know about her wife. My SIL often gets frustrated with me about how my daughter acts. I understand her frustration, but I\u2019m trying.

And find a psychologist that works with young children.  Now!", "YWBTA, absolutely. TBH if your daughter isn't okay with people simply talking about the baby, I do not see her behaving remotely acceptable at a party centered around said baby. You'd also be the AH if you brought her. If you can't find a sitter, it might be best to sit the shower out, tbh. Bc if your daughter causes a scene, she could potentially ruin what's supposed to be a beautiful day for your sister. It's your sister and her wifes day, do not enable your daugher by bringing her a gift.\n\nMy mom would give my sister a gift every year on MY BIRTHDAY. That same sister once fractured my tailbone, ON MY BIRTHDAY, trying to steal the money I had received. That same sister also stabbed me with a steak knife in the hand, on my birthday, another year. It would have went into my eyeball had I not thrown my hand up to protect myself. This is what happens when you enable that behavior.", "She's been spoiled for 8 years.

This baby is a reality she's going to have to face and I would think that having the adults around her walking on eggshells every time it's mentioned must be adding a lot of stress and tension to the situation.", "[removed]", "YWBTA \n\nYour daughter needs to learn the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her and by playing into it you\u2019ll just be adding to the issue.", "YTA - If you know your daughter will act out and you don't have \\*anyone\\* in your life who can watch her (is your kid so awful she doesn't even have friends she can have a playdate with during that time? honestly I wouldn't be shocked given the behavior you've explained in this post) you just shouldn't attend this event, and if people ask why you've gotta be honest.", "Info:  Has your daughter never been to a birthday party before.....or are you that parent who brings a gift for your daughter to open during other kids parties too?", "YWBTA.  I know you\u2019re doing it out of love, but our jobs as parents are to develop, not to be friends with our kids.  8 years old is plenty old enough to learn to share affection, and I shudder to think of who that child grows up into if they don\u2019t learn it.", "YWBTA. If you are letting an 8 year old run your life now it will only get worse. Your job isn't to make your kids life \"easy\" but to help prepare them for the rest of their life, which most certainly won't be easy.", "Ywbth your daughter is going to have to come to terms about the baby.

Leaving the shower early.\n\nOr if you think your daughter is going to have a tantrum about your sister and the baby getting all the attention then don\u2019t go. Being absent is better then stealing you sister and sil spotlight or ruining their shower.\n\n\nAnd anyone else think it was an accident that she just found out 3 days before the shower? To me it feels like maybe they didn\u2019t want to invite op and niece for fear neice would ruin the shower.

This is your problem, keep her and her jealousy  at home.", "YWBTA and you absolutely have a choice here. Your whole post of asking if YTA if you bring a gift for your poorly behaved jealous uninvited child, instead of if YTA for putting your sister first & missing the shower to stay home with your child, reeks of your entitlement. No wonder your kid acts the way she does. Try harder to find a sitter or don\u2019t go. If your 8 yo is such a spoiled brat that she will cause drama, she should definitely not attend.", "YTA.  Don't go to the shower then. \n\nThis event isn't about you or your daughter.  And she's not going to be getting a playmate.  There's an 8-year difference between them.

Totally.\n\nYour daughter needs to learn the world does not revolve around her. \n\nI wonder if they were trying to exclude you from the shower? Howcome you only found out now?", "The more tantrums you prevent by appeasing your daughter, the more tantrums she will throw. You are teaching her and rewarding bad behavior. This will not end unless you stop giving into her and making it clear it is unacceptable. YWBTA.", "YWBTA - YTA - Stop. Your solution is the pits. She's like this because 8+ years she was not guided well so you are reaping what you've sown.\n\nChildren need to learn empathy and facts like, \"I'm not the center of attention.\" It not normal for a non-sibling to be given a gift during someone's baby shower. You are the ahole for creating this solution. You did not share how you are coaching her to understand this concept.  You are just trying to survive? Stay home if this is so stressful and how did you not know the correct date?", "DO NOT DO THIS. It sets a terrible precedent. Will your daughter be expecting presents at her cousin\u2019s future birthdays too? Don\u2019t be one of *those* parents. \n\nYou won\u2019t be doing your daughter any favors.

This is a good chance to teach her that it's not all about her.\n\nYWBTA", "YTA. You know this is an issue and you're actively enabling it if you go through with this idea. Get a sitter, send a gift and don't attend, or the second your daughter starts to act up leave and explain to her that if she can't let other people be important too then she can't be at their celebrations.", "YWBTA\n\nTime to be a parent and teach your kid she's not the center of the universe.

You are encouraging anti- social behavior by rewarding your little entitled,  selfish grandkid. I was the only grandkid for a long time and was never made to feel like I was a commodity.  UGH!", "YTA. Please don't reward bad behavior. I know you fear her making a scene etc. Perhaps spend your money on a sitter instead of a present ... and don't take her to the shower.", "Eight?! Yes, you would be the asshole. Wtf. Raising an entitled brat is what you're doing. Good grief, the fact that she is 8 and you are even considering this is pathetic.", "YWBTA  your daughter is acting very selfish and spoilt and by the sounds of it you're only encouraging it. \nDon't give her a gift just because, how many times do you do that? Maybe you need to think about how to reprimand bad behaviour instead of rewarding it", "YTA. You're raising a Princess. It will get worse. Time to work on not the only child. Things are changing. For the record 8 years older nothing in common with baby/toddler. What kind of play. She'll be a teenager by then. Just in time to be a babysitter.", "YWBTA, but if you are reading the replies, you probably have guessed that by now.  \nTime to fix this before it becomes a bigger problem for everyone. Unless raising a selfish, entitled monster is your goal.", "YWBTA - a tantrum seems inevitable whether she gets a gift or not. Best to sit this one out and let the mother to be enjoy her day.", "YTA\n\nI understand your daughter is having a hard time sharing attention but bringing her a gift to an event that has nothing to do with her is only gonna instill the mindset that every celebration needs to be about her.", "YTA, it sounds like you might have a problem with another baby in the family too", "YTA. You\u2019re supposed to be raising a functioning member of society. That\u2019s not who you are describing. I think you need less excuses and more parenting. Good luck.", "YWBTA, you're hurting your daughter in the long run. Life doesn't work like that.\n\nLet me share my story, Since the day I was born I had a favorite aunt and I was her favorite niece. We were 2 peas in a pod and I could see the sun through her eyes. Suddenly she gets married (I might have been 7 or 8 at the time), I was not happy about it but I dealt with it; not that I was given any options though lol. OK, I was finally making peace with the idea of sharing her with her husband, when couple of years later she gets pregnant with her 1st daughter. I was beyond mad, but nobody paid much attention to it. My great aunt took me to the hospital to meet \"my new cousin\", if eyes were daggers she would have been dead right on the spot. Jealousy to the max expression.  I distanced myself from them for about 2 years, then one day I was close to her house, and I decided to stop and say hello. The most adorable little girl opened the door (until this day over 30 years later, nobody knows how she did, no nanny, no aunt, no uncle and not overprotective big Airedale terrier were around). From that day forward I adored her. Growing up she used to ask me \"tell me again the story when you began to love me\".\n\nSo you see? this too shall pass. Either you find a babysitter, or you excuse yourself from the baby shower. Do not bring her along, she will ruin your sister special day, and your daughter would end up hating her cousin even more.", "YWBTA you need to set boundaries with your daughter before you arrive. Shes 8, tell her before you even leave the house the behavior you expect of her, and if she doesn't follow your expectations then what the consequences will be, and if she doesn't listen FOLLOW THROUGH.", "**YTA**  The last thing you want to do is reinforce your daughter's jealousy about another child receiving attention.    Pretty soon your family is going to be writing posts about how your daughter always has to steal the spotlight at every family event-- which she probably already does but you dismiss it as \"she's just a child\"-- and always getting gifts for other people's milestones.\n\nIf your daughter is having \"bad reactions\" now, it will get much worse when the baby actually arrives.   Instead of spending money on gifts, get her some sessions with a child therapist.", "i don't know about an AH, but it would be a bad idea. don't bring her a gift, but do bring her something to do, like an activity bag or coloring book. don't set up the expectation that her cousin can't be celebrated and have gifts without the same treatment for her.", "Yes of course YTA. You already are by tolerating this behaviour at all. Get a babysitter and maybe put her in therapy while you\u2019re at it.", "YTA.\n\nIf you give her a present to open at her aunt\u2019s baby shower, you\u2019re setting a precedent that her poor behavior in relation to her cousin results in a reward.

Your sister's baby shower should be totally about her and her baby. If that's going to be a problem then either find a babysitter or don't go.", "YWBTA I get that it's hard, but this will get so much worse as she gets older if you don't correct the behavior now. Maybe try involving her as a \"helper\" at the shower. She still gets attention, but in a socially acceptable way. (Ie: passing out the papers and pens for baby shower games). Good luck and congrats to your sister!", "YWBTA. You need to teach your daughter that she won\u2019t always be the center of attention. Imagine if someone insisted on opening their present at your daughter\u2019s party and how she would react.", "Please don't bring your daughter to a baby-shower where she is sure to behave badly and detract from your sister's experience and everyone else's as well. You already know that you won't be able to focus on honoring your sister. Give her the gift of a lovely celebratory party... by staying home.", "No\u2026 do not bring a gift. Maybe instead ask her to help at the shower by gathering all the bows and making a flower out of them. Or find a sitter if she\u2019s really going to be that upset about another baby coming in to the family.", "YWBTA you would only be rewarding her for her bad behavior. She won\u2019t be number one in everything in life and at 8, she should have a good understanding of this. This would be a good opportunity for her to learn how to deal with that. If she can\u2019t take it, then she can sit and sulk by herself, but don\u2019t baby her anymore.", "YWBTA Your daughter is old enough to know better than to act this way, and keep it up for months.

Thi day is about the couple and the new baby arriving soon.\nOther kids are great  and love being given little \"jobs\".....hand the presents to mom to open,  hand out pencils and paper f there are games to play,", "YTA\n\nEight years old is plenty old enough to understand the that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you.", "Good god in heaven please do not DO THIS. Please. This is the worst way you can handle this. You tell her to behave herself and no pouting or there will be consequences.", "YWBTA. You've coddled your daughter. If she misbehaves during the shower then she will have to face real consequences. Time to start punishing bad behaviour not rewarding it with gifts.", "This sounds like a really frustrating time for everyone involved, including you. I get it breaks your heart to see your daughter struggling but she's 8 years old. That's old enough to understand and learn to share.\n\nIt will be tough because you guys have pampered her for eight years, but bringing a gift will not help with her overall conduct, so YWBTA I think.\n\nMaybe get a babysitter? Or talk to her before going and explain that if she throws a tantrum you guys will leave the party early (and follow through), help her learn that sharing the attention is not a bad thing.\n\nGood luck!", "YTA. Your daughter is not the honouree. Do what you want at home.", "Yes YWBTA. Your child is behaving like a brat. (I\u2019m not saying she is a brat - but this behavior is bratty.). Shut it down.

That\u2019s how life works.", "YTA. It's not fair to the expectant mom to have to accommodate your daughter at an event to celebrate the arrival of her new baby. The sooner she learns that she can't be the center of everything, the better. No different than asking if your daughter should receive a gift for someone's wedding or graduation. If you feel that she will have difficulty, she should not come.  And by the way, she will not get better after baby is born.", "YWBTA. She's 8. That's plenty old enough to realize that the world doesn't revolve around her.", "I want to add that your daughter's jealousy and volatile behaviour mean that she should very closely watched once the baby is born.

She\u2019s perfectly capable of understanding what is going on.

You need to parent her, not pander to her.", "Yes. YWBTA. You gonna do this at birthday parties, too? Start (well, kinda) as you mean to go on from here. It\u2019s time she learns that we have to share and it\u2019s part of the gig. 8 is plenty old enough to understand the world as a whole doesn\u2019t revolve around her and you\u2019re being ridiculous by letting her think it does.", "YTA.. your daughter isn\u2019t \u201cloved\u201d she\u2019s spoiled rotten.

On birthdays she is going to blow out their candles or throw tantrums because they did not get any. You are doing your child a disservice by enabling her bad behavior.

I mean, do you plan on having more kids? \n\nYou should emphasise on her role in the baby's life. Take her to choose a gift for the baby. Drive home how she'll be a big sister and protector of her little cousin. \n\nI'm sure once she sees the baby, she'll fall in love.\nHowever, if you start pandering to her jealousy, you'll further reinforce that she has 'competition' for everyones' affection.", "YWBTA. I know that it's hard, but this is the time to step up and be a parent. I would probably not bring her at all if I were you, and this is going to have to be something you continue to work on with her. Realize that if you let this sit without addressing it head on and sticking to it you will be raising a narcissist. At some point you need to stop reassuring her and make it clear that it's not acceptable to get upset when someone else gets a present. Emotional regulation is a hard won skill but it's one of the most important for a child to learn.", "YTA - \n\nYou need to just stay home.  I see your trying but what you are trying.  If you don't have it in you to use a very heavy hand and put a stop to your daughter's abhorrent behavior just stay home.  \n\nIt's okay to take space and deal with this problem but you first have to understand that this attitude of hers will run though all things, you need to spend the next few months showing her she can't get her way, there are little things you can do like not allowing her to pick out her cloths but chose her hair style for school each day or cooking things that she's never tried or saying no to outings or treats, little subtle ways of showing her it's not all about her, but very gently", "Why exactly do you think your daughter will \"act better once the baby is born\" if you continue to reward her inappropriate behavior?

Don't take your daughter to the baby shower, she will have a screaming hissy fit. Even if that means just sending your present with your apologies. It's interesting that you think she will be ok when the baby arrives, but what (other than hope and crossing your fingers) makes you think that? How do you know she won't have a violent reaction? I'd be extremely cautious about not leaving her alone with the baby when it arrives or you may be having to explain little \"accidents\" or even worse! Get her to see a child therapist ASAP.", "Ywbta for coddling your child's tantrum at no longer being  the doted upon one.

Don't do it during, as you\n\n1. would only further cement the bad behavior\n2. would take the focus away from your Sis, who is the focus of the party\n3. She's 8 years old. She needs to learn that not everything is going to be about her. Kids typically learn this much earlier.\n\nIf she's going to act up, perhaps consider leaving at the first sign (again, see steps 1-3 again).", "Ywbta if you don't first talk to your sister, and see what she would prefer. Offer to a) do as you've suggested *if* she and her wife are on with it, b) swing by with a gift and well wishes, but not stay in order to avoid a melt down from daughter, or c) attend but leave immediately if daughter misbehaves. And obviously, if you go with c), talk to your daughter before hand and explain that her getting worked up is not on and you will both need to leave should smher emotions overwhelm her. I presume you're also looking into ways to help her manage big emotions, it's something adults can struggle with as well!!", "I would recommend taking her to a child psychologist. My sister acted like this before I was born. She resented me and it took therapy for her to help get over that feeling of resentment.", "YWBTA. this is your time to guide your daughter and teach her what is and is not okay. its absolutely unreasonable that she throws fits over other people paying attention to your sisters baby bump or buying her presents. I know you think this behavior will resolve once the baby is born, but it will not. it will almost certainly get worse.", "I think you need to ask them both - your sister and SIL- about what you would like to do. \n\nI want to call you an AH, but honestly you seem to be very clear that this isn't okay and your daughter is not a precious princess who should never not be the center of attention, you are just a parent dealing with bad behavior, as all parents have to deal with at some point. \n\nIt also sounds like you are trying to deal with the problem. So you recognize this isn't right, and you are trying to fix it, and it isn't going to go away right away. And, she isn't the first child to have these feelings, so she isn't a monster, just a kid. \n\nSo, I am going to say NAH, so long as you speak to your wife and SIL and be as frank and honest as you were here: My daughter is being a little shit. I know it and I am sorry, and I am doing X, Y, Z to deal with it. I can also understand why this happened- only kid for 8 years- but I am not in any way excusing her behavior. I wouldn't take her to the baby shower if I could, because this is your day, but of course I would like to be there to celebrate. I anticipate she is going to have a meltdown, so my options are: We don't come at all, I bring a present for her to have a moment of attention and only use it if/when she acts up, I don't bring a present and leave as soon as a meltdown starts, or I stay and try and deal with the meltdown in another room. \n\nBe clear that  this decision is up to them, and they can think about it and of course even change their mind. They are about to be parents, they are going to have their own hard moments, and this is also their day. You are happy to stay home but want them to know how happy you are for them and wanted to be there, you can leave when a meltdown starts (again, sorry, you love them), or you can do this present idea.

She\u2019s the only grandchild on both sides of our family. She\u2019s very loved. When my sister found out she was pregnant, my daughter had a hard time sharing the attention. She gets upset when anyone talks about the baby, touches my sister\u2019s baby bump, or when they buy the new baby stuff without buying her something. \n\nI know this behavior isn\u2019t okay, but I feel like my daughter is struggling. I\u2019ve tried reading books, reassuring her, and even talking to our pediatrician. Nothing is working. \n\nMy sister is due in a few weeks, so her MIL is throwing her a baby shower. I didn\u2019t know about the baby shower until yesterday. The baby shower is Saturday. I don\u2019t have a sitter and my husband is going to be working. I have no other choice but to bring my daughter. I know she will have a bad reaction to my sister\u2019s baby being showered with gifts, so I thought about bringing her a small gift to unwrap during the shower. I don\u2019t think my sister will be upset, but I don\u2019t know about her wife. My SIL often gets frustrated with me about how my daughter acts. I understand her frustration, but I\u2019m trying. I think my daughter will act better once the baby is born and she has a cousin to play with, but for now I\u2019m just trying to survive. \n\nWIBTA here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s hard to watch our kids hurt. I don\u2019t think giving a gift is the right way to help her cope. Not only does it reinforce bad behavior, but it also teaches her that she has to have someone buy you stuff when she\u2019s having a hard time emotionally.

What do you think new baby would do if they saw a snake? If we ever saw a snake by new baby, we could handle it, right? Because we aren\u2019t little babies. We\u2019re big!

Their first birthday? Any religious occasions that include gifts? Like where's the line? Or are you going to raise her to be entitled and Bratty?

And you can acknowledge her feelings about things changing, and that it\u2019s okay to feel those feelings. But it\u2019s also important to express those feelings in appropriate ways at appropriate times. \n\nI think that it\u2019s not a bad idea to gift a little something to keep her occupied at the shower, but before the shower. If she\u2019s into drawing, maybe a nice art pad with special color pencils or markers. If she\u2019s into Roblox, a gift card to do the paid stuff there. Arts and crafts kit? Book?

Choose out a special activity beforehand that she can bring? Can you talk with sis beforehand and maybe daughter can be a special helper to bring gifts to sis and SIL, or make a big bow out of all the ribbons, whatever.

That's the type of parenting that doesn't cause trauma. I would suggest add an element of the baby to the present, so the present brings her towards the baby. Opening her mind to a new pathway, to aim that emotional struggle with sharing attention. Give her a present that's a \"welcome to cousin hood\" , older guidance, caretaking type role. Show her her role, show her how she's important to the baby. Bring her in so she doesn't feel at war with the baby, like it's her or / against it. Show her her place and how she can be a benefit to the baby. Talk about all the things she can do / be for and with the baby. Get everyone at the baby shower talking about fond memories of their cousins, specifically kind things their older cousins did for them. So she can see how she can be, and be proud of that new role. It's hard for some kids to acclimatise to new things, and changes. A good parent in patent with that and helps and guides them.\n\n Your SIL is TA for not being patent with a kid, who doesn't have a fully formed frontal cortex, yet. Kids display these behaviours, you don't yell them into behaving, you kindly guide them.

I would suggest your SIL is going to be a really bad parent.", "A lot if people saying stay home, I personally would still take her and use it as a teachable moment that others can and will be celebrated whether she likes it or not.

I have kids RIGHT around your kids' age, and a simple conversation would be enough. This might be a time for you, as the parent, to take a look at your parenting. I'm not going to say it's abnormal for a child to feel this jealous over a cousin, but I'd take a serious step back and look at what you're doing honestly.
