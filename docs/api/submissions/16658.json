I would find it super rude too if someone lit incense or even strong smelling candles in my place while visiting without asking. Sounds like a crappy friend who needs to find somewhere else to stay, your babies health is more important.", "NTA. Your friend should've asked, not assumed you would be fine with it. Your friend turning your request as being culturally insensitive means she missed the point of your request.", "> Then a few days later I get this long text basically saying how it was so wrong of me to ask that because it disrespected her culture. \n\nThere's probably a counter-argument to be made about her disrespecting *your* culture by not asking the host whether it was okay to do something that would leave a pervasive smell throughout their home... since that seems to me as though it would be an entirely normal sort of thing to ask!\n\nNTA. If you're a guest in someone's home, you're a guest in their home - it's not yours and you don't make the rules.", "NTA! She can do whatever in her own home.", "NTA.  You have an infant child and being around smoke is not good for them.  Your friend should have asked instead of assuming it was OK baby or not as the smell of incense tends to linger in a home for a long time.", "NTA. It\u2019s super not respectful that she just lit some incense in your house. I would never do that when it\u2019s not my home. Even if it\u2019s my home I\u2019d ask a guest I\u2019d they\u2019d mind before doing that.", "NTA, that strong smell is far too much for a baby\u2019s senses, she\u2019s being a rude and entitled guest and she just got there.", "NTA. If her culture neccessitates a pervading smell, she should not be staying with friends.", "NTA. Settling in or even being encouraged to treat someone else's place as yours for a few weeks does NOT include doing things that pervade the entire house/affect a baby. When staying with someone, it's courteous to check in/ask about boundaries and things that can impact the entire house (noise level, strong smells, chore protocols.) Assuming a host would be cool with incense seems unreasonable.", "NTA \n\nNice she likes incense but your house and especially with a baby your rules. \n\nAnd at 26 she should know the world does not need to accommodate her wants. \n\nYou offered to accommodate her as long as she opens the window in the room.  Perhaps she could go sit in her car and burn it there?  \n\nIf she needs a place to stay and burn incense perhaps she should check AirB&B tho she may find it isn\u2019t allowed there either. \n\nAnd not sure hotels allow it either. \n\nIf she finds this a deal breaker please wish her well when you tell her you understand and invite her to leave.", "Did you send her a long text back letting her know that she must follow the house rules or she will need to make other arrangements?", "Well I mean she could just walk into another room not force you into her culture and if it\u2019s bad for the baby then yeah your NTA it does seem a bit insensitive to not consider her culture but like a strong incense in a small apartment is torture especially if you\u2019re like me who is sensitive to smell", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
