When we are not working, we spend pretty much every second together. Even more so because we both primarily work from home. When we first moved in together, I requested weekly time by myself. Not entire days or anything, just like 4 hours a week where I can really focus on my own interests/hobbies, and she agreed. At first, things were going perfect. During my free time, she would often go to her friends house and hang out. After about 6 months, that stopped. She started staying at home, and when I said I was going to my office for some alone time, she got irritated and said things like \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just scroll through facebook for 4 HOURS\u201d or \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just take a nap because you don\u2019t want to spend time with me\u201d. I felt bad because she honestly doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends or any real hobbies. So I started reducing my alone time, which virtually disappeared. I didn\u2019t have a problem with it at first, because I do enjoy the time we do spend together. However, most of the time is spent doing things she likes to do, like watching the shows she wants to watch, or playing a videogame that shes way more into than I am. I suggested numerous times to play something or watch something that was more interesting to me, and she consistently says that would just make her bored. For instance, I am a diehard fan of a football team, and I requested to watch all the games during the season every sunday, but she asked \u201cwell what am I supposed to do while you watch your stupid game every week?\u201d I said \u201cwell, whatever you want to do\u2026\u201d\u2026.Anyway, I recently requested again to have my 4 hours of alone time and she basically tried guilt tripping me into not talking about it again and how she has no friends and nothing to do when I have my alone time. I told her I am not responsible for your entertainment or happiness and that I will be taking 4 hours to myself weekly.

You shouldnt have to negotiate for allocated time.\n\nShe's not a child. She should be able to entertain herself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis will ONLY get worse as time passes. Up the time, two hours a day. See if she can adapt to it. If she can't, it's the mother of all red flags.", "NTA, and PLEASE regard my advice here:\n\nMy wife has been like this in the past. You've already broken your own personal boundaries for her, so guess what she learned? She learned that sarcastically commenting on your requests for things you want to do makes you stop doing them. She is emotionally manipulating you and I guarantee you almost everybody who replies to this sees it plain as day.\n\nYou need boundaries, and you need to enforce them regardless of what your gf says. You also need to have a serious conversation about how she is manipulating you into spending more time with her. I went into times of deep dark depression because I didn't see this happening in my own life, and it took a lot of reading and therapy to figure it out.\n\nI recommend reading the book boundaries by Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend.", "NTA, and she needs therapy. That behavior is extremely manipulative and codependent, as she\u2019s placing the burden of fulfilling her happiness on you without putting any effort into it herself. She is capable of making friends, going places, developing hobbies, and pursuing her interests. It isn\u2019t your responsibility to sacrifice all of your individual enjoyment in order to maintain her happiness, and asking you to do so is extremely selfish. \n\nIf you cave to that, you\u2019re going to resent this relationship in time, and it will end badly.", "NTA - It is not healthy for someone to expect this level of togetherness, people need their own time to themselves. You've been very upfront and tried to discuss this with her and she clearly doesn't care. This won't change and for your own mental well being, don't stick around.", "NTA\nTo be honest you both don't sound very compatible, and she comes off as a selfish jerk. You should get to do the things you want to do just as much as she does the things she wants to do. Plus it's not your fault she doesn't have any friends or hobbies.\n\nI doing you'll ever really be happy with her. She seems like she's super clingy and needs a ton of attention. \n\nIf you wanted that, you could get a puppy.", "NTA. Everyone is entitled to some alone time. Sit her down and ask what happened with her friend and why she\u2019s not spending time over there anymore. \n\nTake her out to meet new people and tell her that it isn\u2019t healthy for your relationship to spend every free moment together. It\u2019s not healthy, for real. \n\nTell her you need your alone time and encourage her to use those hours to focus on herself and her mental health. Good luck, brother.", "NTA --- As a couple you need to do things separately from each other otherwise what do you have to talk about when you are together 24/7, and when she says/asks what am I supposed to do when you're watching your stuff ask her well what are you supposed to do when you are more or less being forced to watch what she wants.", "NTA.\n\nSet boundaries with her. You need to be firm on your stance.", "NTA. Just because you're together doesn't mean you must spend every waking moment with her.", "NTA\n\nEveryone needs their own personal time. Set boundaries or it's only going to get worse.", "NTA.  In a healthy relationship both partners have outside interests and boundaries.  What you are asking for is perfectly normal and healthy IMO.   Your partner's responses are not.", "NTA \n\nCodependent partners are not easy to deal with. I sympathize. If you want to preserve the relationship long term you may suggest she goto a therapist they would be able to help her work towards more independence socially.", "NTA. It is amazing how many adults don't have hobbies anymore. She needs to learn how to make herself happy. This is not your burden. Sometimes we are alone. Suck it up, buttercup.", "NTA. Being in a relationship it's necessary to have \"alone\" time to do what you want whether that be a hobby or whatever you want it to be. Spending every moment together with someone is really overwhelming. Maybe help her find a new hobby she can get into. She shouldn't be shaming you into spending every single moment together.", "Ugh. I am a person that needs a lot of alone time and really dislike romantic/family/friend relationships where the other person thinks they own all of your free time. They don't understand that it's not just a matter of what you're doing during those 4 hours, but the feeling of independence you get from them.\n\nThe good news is that there's a very easy way for you to guarantee your 4 free hours and more every week AND, as a bonus, you get to watch all the shows and play all the games you like, too...\n\nNTA.", "NTA. She needs a hobby. She needs to go to the gym. Read a book. You are not the circus.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nFour hours a week is a really, really small request. One football game a week (that she is welcome to watch with you, it sounds like, she just doesn\u2019t want to) is also not exactly a huge imposition. Wanting to do things you enjoy, or to have some alone time, is absolutely baseline reasonable, and it worries me that she has you questioning it.\n\nI hope she has something major going for her, because you are describing someone easily bored, controlling, passive-aggressive, resentful, contemptuous, self-centered, and demanding. Which, I gotta say, is not an attractive set of traits.", "NTA..... You're not responsible to entertain her or for her not having friends. Have we thought about why she doesn't have friends?? \nThere are a lot of things that she could go and do for herself but for some reason is choosing not to??\nIt's important for not only you to realize but also for her to realize that you cannot lose your identity in a relationship. Dating or married it doesn't matter you each need to have your own individual time to do your own thing. It's not healthy having someone breathing down your neck 24/7. \nCreate boundaries and if she chooses not to go along with them or chooses to continuously guilt you, then you have some serious decision making to do. \nTherapy is needed and would be a great tool for her. Best of luck!", "nta, next time she wants to do what she wants ask her \"why should I do what you want and be bored?\"", "NTA. She is controlling. You are not responsible for her lack of friendships outside of you. I'd really examine why she doesn't have friends. Is she this clingy and does she use emotional blackmail in relationships outside of yours? \n\nThis would be enough for me to break up, honestly.", "NTA, but I\u2019m a bit worried because she sounds very dependent on you, which isn\u2019t very healthy\u2026 (It\u2019s great to be co-dependent to a certain degree, in a couple, \u2026 to be able to do stuff together and have a good complicity - but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to be 100% dependent on another person).\nMaybe you could help her find a hobby? \nOr during your \u201calone time\u201d, she could play the video games that she likes or watch her shows or some of the other things that you sometimes do together but that she\u2019s more into than you are.\nAlso I\u2019m wondering if you tried to talk to her about how this situation is making you feel (instead of just saying you need time for yourself).", "NTA\n\nBuy her the book \u201cFacing Codependence\u201d by Pia Melody and tell her to read that while you\u2019re having your alone time if she\u2019s bored. \n\nShe\u2019s being manipulative and that\u2019s abusive on its face whether it\u2019s her intention or not. \n\nYou are not her emotional support animal. She needs to get a hobby, make some friends\u2026something.\n\n4 hours alone per week wouldn\u2019t be enough for me (44F) by the way. I spend that much time easily on one day on the weekend doing my hobby.", "NTA. But she sounds emotionally immature.", "You\u2019re NTA at all but it does sound like she\u2019s very co-dependent. I was the same because I had separation anxiety and my partner had to gently tell me that it was becoming an issue. It led to me starting therapy and I\u2019m now way more social. To the point where I have to share my calendar with him now so he knows what I\u2019m up to! \n\nYou could be incompatible or it could just be that she needs to do some inner work but doesn\u2019t know/is avoiding it and choosing to focus her all on you. It\u2019s a distraction mechanism so she doesn\u2019t have to focus on all she doesn\u2019t have going on in her life. \n\nPlease tell her gently but firmly. First describe the boundary and that you need your alone time. All humans do. Then if she still disrespects your boundaries then I\u2019m afraid you might need to give her an ultimatum.\n\nSending you love and good luck!", "NTA\nPlease insist on \"me time\" minus the snark from your gf. If she is incapable of giving you that, this relationship is not for you.", "NTA.\n\nAlone time is important for a lot of people. And frankly four hours a week isn\u2019t much at all.\n\nI have to say though that the bigger problem is her selfishness and childishness and why you\u2019re willing to cater to it. Why are you allowing yourself to be bullied?", "NTA.  Codependency is a slippery slope. If you can't watch at your own place, maybe start watching every game at a buddy's house or the bar to get her used to hanging out by herself ... but don't keep compromising and giving in.  FWIW, 4 hours a week wouldn't be even CLOSE to enough alone time for me and even though I know everyone is different ... I think it's reasonable to want more like 10-12 hours a week.", "NTA. Everyone needs their down time. It sounds like she has no hobbies outside of you and work. Perhaps it time she finds some. \n\nShe could volunteer at an animal shelter or the like. Maybe she could benefit from learning a craft. I took up cookie decorating that quickly segued into designing and printing custom cookie cutters. Hell, even a part time job might benefit her. \n\nBecause you're 100% right; you're not responsible for her entertainment. What happens if the two of you break up? Who's going to entertain her then? She needs to develop her own tastes and interests.", "NTA.  You sound kind of like a hostage at this point.  Everyone should be able to have time alone or time pursuing different hobbies or see their friends .\n\nAlso you shouldn\u2019t  have to negotiate a certain # of hours, like you\u2019re some child asking permission. As long as it\u2019s not excessive, that shouldn\u2019t be necessary unless your partner is trying to control your every minute.", "NTA- having time on your own to do your own hobbies is what healthy couples DO. If she can not play a video game or watch a movie on her own, then she has issues.\n\nNo its not up to you to entertain her 24/7.", "It's healthy for couples to have their own hobbies or other time away.  It's normal.  NTA\n\n4 hours a week for your own time is not too much to ask.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is really sad that she needs constant companionship, and is unable to entertain herself for a few hours. It isn't right that she expects you to put her need for companionship above your need for space. It is selfish of her.\n\n She needs to get some of her social needs met by hanging out with friends or family. It is totally unfair of her to expect you to do it alone.

What you are asking for is more than reasonable, it's necessary. Especially if her interests are different, there is no reason you should not watch your games on Sunday or have your own friends and activities. Your GF is co-dependent, and you should not enable her co-dependence by limiting your life to suit her. It won't help you or her in the long run.

Therapy would be a good option for her because she is boundary pushing and having boundaries is healthy.

During early lockdown, he was furloughed and I was working from home. He spent a lot of his free time in his woodworking shed and I spent a lot of mine upstairs working on crafts.

I think this is something you need to hold your ground on and when she tries to victimize herself, explain that this isn't just for you, she really needs it too. She needs to work on herself and learn to be more independent of you. She needs to find things she enjoys with other people who also enjoy those things, find a tribe, a social group. It's hard, I know- I'm a homebody and an introvert myself and I have to force myself out of my comfort zone to try different things and meet people or stop being so timid to do things alone. I spent 7-8 years in a relationship where I really isolated myself and my whole life revolved around this person, even when things got toxic I stayed because i was so codependent. I became more afraid of being all alone than of being with someone who treated me like shit. I realize this isn't your situation but just an example of how unhealthy and dangerous it is to be so attached to someone that you don't have your own separate lives and interests. It's so important for both parties to retain a sense of self separate from your relationship. I'm sure if things don't change you will develop a huge resentment towards her from making you feel like you can't enjoy things without her without feeling guilty.

She has a problem if she can\u2019t let you out of her line of sight for a few hours a week.  It\u2019s not like you have even left the house or anything!  You\u2019re not sitting in a bar somewhere.  She is either empty headed or insecure, possibly both.  This is not going to improve if you keep giving in to it.  It may never improve unless she has therapy. You should aim to have at least one hour a day on your own for your sanity.  You might benefit from leaving the house too, going for a walk or even a run.  When girlfriend whines \u201cWell I suppose I might have a nap/scroll through my phone if you don\u2019t want to be with me,\u201d just say \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea!\u201d and go do your thing.  She\u2019s like a parasite who does nothing but suck out your enthusiasm, and she does it while she does her Eeyore face.", "NTA.\n\nShe sounds suffocating. I had issues with being clingy in the past (and even then, certainly not this bad), and my relationship with my bf has improved significantly now that we have sufficient alone time.\n\n4 hours to yourself a WEEK is insanely little. It\u2019s not healthy.", "It is healthy to have regular alone time. Keep doing it. NTA", "yeah and the constant guilt-trips are just so wrong on so many levels. OP, doesn't deserve that. NTA", "Although it doesn't sound like OP can even watch a movie he wants without her complaining about it.", "NTA\nI love my bf but I hated it when he had lost his job during covid. Not just because of the money issue but because he was up my ass all day and it drove me crazy. I like to have some time to myself (now I have it at night once my kids are asleep) and he wanted to spend every minute together.", "NTA. But she needs therapy.", "NTA. \nAs someone with severe attachment issues, I understand where she's coming from. But that doesn't make it healthy. My partner needs alone time, and although it's pretty hard for me it's important that I respect that. But I do slip up sometimes and behave like this. She REALLY, really needs therapy. She's old enough that she won't grow out of it, and she might have some deep rooted reason for the (very unhealthy) codependency that only a therapist could help suss out and have the proper tools to deal with. No matter the reason, her behavior (and mine when I slip up) is manipulative and damaging regardless of her intentions. Personally, I need a lot of reassurance that it is NOT because I've done something wrong or frustrated my partner, it's just something that he needs for his own mental health. 4 hours a week is a very small ask. Reinforce how important this time is to you, and take that time to yourself no matter how much she protests. Giving in to her will do long term damage to your relationship and probably build up resentment, I know from personal experience. \n\nAs for the refusal to do anything you want to do when you're both together, that's just downright selfishness. Do you ever get to do what you want? Consider how long you could realistically put up with that, and if that's something you want to deal with in the future. Don't jeopardize your happiness/wants/needs for her. If she refuses to participate in certain things but gets mad when you do them on your own, it's very likely you're just incompatible. Good luck!", "NTA, she needs to chill and get a few hobbies.  You say she plays video games so why can\u2019t she just do that alone every now and then?", "NTA. Don\u2019t have kids with this woman unless she fixes herself. You\u2019ll never have time to yourself again.", ">NTA this would drive me nuts. I NEED alone time. I feel like you approached the topic with kindness.   \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>But I wonder if she realizes that your time together is ONLY spent on stuff she enjoys. You've tried to ask her to do things that you are interested in but have you specifically pointed out that you're always the one making compromises when it comes to your quality time? It might seem obvious and you might have already broached that topic. She may not realize that you feel that way about the games/shows you consume together.   \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>It's one thing to say I want to watch football with you. It's another to say I don't enjoy stranger things (just an example) as much as you but I watch it because I want to spend time with you and you love it. I love making you happy. I wish that we could watch/play the stuff that I enjoy when we spend time together. It hurts my feelings when you complain about my interests. I think that we need to compromise and take turns picking our tv show or game. And maybe make some ground rules: you both get to choose one thing that you hate to kick out of the rotation. But make it clear that your interests have to be considered.", "[present](https://relatably.com/m/img/memes-creepy-girlfriend/dear-overly-attached-girlfriend-will-you-go-on-a--1-11839-1340384866-3_big.jpg)", "Dump her.

NTA.", "Nta, 4 hours of alone time a week is really not much to ask.", "This will eat away at you until you look at your girlfriend and feel only resentment, dread coming home.from work, etc. At that point you'll go into depression, substance, abuse, an affair, start flirting with suicide, or another mental health issue. Regular aline time is 100 percent a hill to die on. You need to have a talk with your partner and explain that this is not about her and she needs to stop making it about her, this is about you and your needs and your mental health, and if she can't deal with you having some time and space to yourself, you're willing to end the relationship. You also need to be more assertive. Put on the football game, because you enjoy it. When she pulls the guilt trip, don't take the ride. Stay calm and say that what she chooses to do during your alone time is her business, but this is something you need for yourself. Period, end of. Then take that time. Because you need it. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou need to sort this out too as if this relationship continues, you'll just become resentful.   Everyone needs time to be \"selfish\" and do things for themselves.

Cricket. \n\nIt sounds very much like she's tunnel-visioned on the two of you - why did she let her other friends go?

My ex was like this. He refused therapy. He wanted to spend every second with me and wanted to make all of his interests OUR interests. I kept my sanity because he snored so badly, I couldn't sleep in the same room so I got my peace by prying him off at bedtime. I was always drained, overtired, overstimulated, and he was just... Entirely too fucking much. \n\nI resented the fuck out of this bullshit. He refused all efforts to discuss relationship issues. I ended it. That was years ago.
