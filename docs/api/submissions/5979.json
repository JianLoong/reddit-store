Which meant I would be in the wedding party but I wouldn\u2019t be paying for anything because obviously i had no money. I agreed and she asked me if I was ok with wearing a dress because i hadn\u2019t worn one sense I came out. I said it would be ok just for one night but if I could wear my binder with it if it wouldn\u2019t be seen in it so I would feel a little more comfortable. And she said she\u2019d think about it. She picked the dress and my binder wouldn\u2019t be shown at all so I asked if it was alright she told me no because she wanted me to look \u201clady like\u201d and that I agreed to wear a dress so I would survive. I was upset but it was her day so I just left it alone. She asked to speak to me privately and told me that she would appreciate if I grew my hair out and dyed it a more natural color so I could do the hairstyle she wanted. I told her I really didn\u2019t want to but my whole family told me I would survive and I could just cut it and re dye it after the wedding so again I just said yes because I was young and I have a big fear of people being mad at me.  Once the wedding was close we all went to the nail salon and I asked if I could just get regular black nails since it wasn\u2019t like a matching thing and she told me no again and that it wasn\u2019t lady like. Again I just did whatever she wanted. On the day of the wedding when we were getting ready in the morning I asked to not wear makeup bc again we weren\u2019t doing a matching thing. She told me I needed it because all the bridesmaids were. After the reception she was introducing me to her family and friends and she kept introducing me as \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cher\u201d and when finally I corrected her she asked me if I could just be normal for her special day. I lost it there and started yelling telling her she was being unnecessarily mean to me and the she was acting like the middle school bullies I deal with at school and how would she feel if I introduced her to everyone I know as he and made her cut her hair and all the stuff she asked me to do that I agreed to to make her happy on her \u201cspecial day\u201d. But she doesn\u2019t get to have a special year. You get one day. After that I just sat in the corner and wouldn\u2019t participate in the games and the pictures and the dancing. People kept coming over to tell me how childish I was and eventually my uncles wife cried everyone told me to apologize. I had nothing to say to her. All I said was look who\u2019s being a child now. It\u2019s been a year and she still won\u2019t talk to me.

Why did she ask you to be in her wedding if what she wanted was someone else entirely? You are not a prop, and you were 14. She is an adult acting like a child.", "NTA. Your aunt used her wedding to try to force you back into being a girl. At every opportunity she had to embrace you as you are, she instead pressured you to conform to a gender that you aren't. Telling you that you needed to work harder at being normal? You're a kid and she used her wedding to pressure and bully you knowing that you'd feel the pressure to conform and not make waves. She even cried to try to leverage the family to get you to do what she wanted?! Enough. \n\nNot having her talk to you sounds like a win. Ignore her antics. You do not need to apologize for telling her the truth about how she was behaving.", "NTA. You are a child who was being pressured into behavior you didn't want to do. Pressured by an adult. Yes it was \"her day\" but she kept moving the goalposts little by little. Trying to make it seem like one more thing wasn't a big deal. But it was.\nHer erasing the identity you have tried to discover and create is bigger than \"her day.\"", "NTA, hell no you did nothing wrong OP. Your aunt was deliberately cruel by looking at you as if  you were nothing more than just some wedding doll for her to dress and glam up. She obviously has some repressed negative feelings about you coming out as non-binary because she intentionally had you dressed to the nines as any female in a wedding party would be. For crying out loud, she even kept referring to you by female pronouns when she knew full well that you were NB. She clearly only sees you as a female and not as a NB individual and it would not surprise me that this whole ordeal of you being in the wedding party was nothing more than a stunt she created to try and get you to come across as more female in appearance. Your aunt was gambling on you just putting up with her repeated efforts into making you look and appear like the typical female when that was what you never wanted to happen. Her intentions finally became clear when she kept misidentifying you with the wrong pronouns to her family and friends. At that point her bigotry had fully risen to the surface, but I give you all the credit in the world for staying strong and standing up to her cruel, hateful personality. Verbally annihilating her like you did and reducing her to tears at her own wedding couldn't have been more fitting of an outcome for such an ignorant, hate filled thing like her.", "NTA- it\u2019s really unfair because it sounds like backing out and not being a bridesmaid wasn\u2019t really an option for you. Sometimes you have to let people be mad. You are a kid and she is being very petty to continue to hold a grudge. You are doing nothing wrong.", "Fuck no NTA. Just wearing the dress was more of an accommodation that she showed you the entire time.  The fact that the rest of your family pushed you into it showed that they're not accepting you either.\n\nIn the future, \"No\" is a complete answer, and needs no explication.", "OMG, just be \u201cnormal\u201d!?! This woman doesn\u2019t even realize how giant of a bully she was!", "NTA you lasted longer than I would have, color coordination at a wedding I can understand, but the hair and binder? This just sounds like she saw an opportunity to try to \"fix you\". Has she ever come at you with this kinda crap before?", "NTA \n\nYour Aunt forced you to have your breasts on show rather than bound! You\u2019re a 14 year old kid who has come out as NB. \n\nShe forced you to be a girl when you are not a girl. \n\nShe acted like a bully and your entire family acted like bullies. \n\nThey should have simply said we want this and you can simply say no! Or they allow you to be you!\n\nThey are not allowed to misgender you on purpose, tell you to act \u201cnormal\u201d inferring you are not normal and make you wear makeup and nails. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you. Your Aunt is mean!", "NTA. You were absolutely right to call her bigotry out as you did. If that ruined her special day, that's her problem, not yours. It was gross and transphobic of her to make her demands in the first place but especially so when she asked if you could \"just be normal for her special day.\"", "NTA, she's a bigot.", "NTA\n\nBridezilla is your aunt's real deal.\n\nIf she's not talking to you, you're better off.

You went above and beyond. You were out as NB and should have been treated like it.  She could have asked you to play a role in the wedding that didn\u2019t require you to look and act feminine or she could have just let you wear clothing that still matched the theme but didn\u2019t force you to wear a dress. She told you to be \u201cnormal \u201c for the day but instead forced you to be abnormal. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you and I\u2019m super proud of you for standing up for yourself! Don\u2019t you dare apologize to that \u2026..!", "NTA - Not at all!\nSounds to me like she kept pushing and pushing you with no respect for you and your feelings. Good job standing up for yourself in the end! You really should have had some other adults backing you up when she first started overstepping, but since you didn't, she was able to push to far to a point, where you had to stop her in the end to be true to yourself.\nThe only thing you can take with you from this, is that in the future, you should say no the first time, you are asked to do something, you don't really like. Good people will respect that, and people like her will probably show their true face much sooner and give you a chance to back out before it escalates further.", "NTA. She was being transphobic, and more precisely enbyphobic against you from the very beggining.\n\nShe didn't ask you to wear a dress, let your hair grow and get your nails done colorful just because she wanted \"a special day\", she did it because she sees you as a young girl that doesn't behave \"normal\". She doesn't respect your gender and thus, doesn't respect you. Easy as that.\n\nI'm sorry you had to go through all of this and find out that way that your aunt does not respect you, but that's what she proved.\n\nDon't worry about losing contact with her, you don't need someone that's ashamed of you around. If she ever realizes NB people are real and not a delusion, I'm sure she'll let you know, and then, you can choose to keep in contact with her or stay LC/NC.", "Harsh maybe - terrible timing yes -  A* (if you were older)\n\nAt the end of the day you should have backed out when aunty first made the request not because you mind doing it for one night, but because you clearly do not have a supportive family and kinda should have seen it comming. \n\n\nBut I will say, your whole family made it as difficult as possible for you not to and your a kid so NTA", "NTA. She went into the situation obviously understanding that you are nonbinary and continued to shift her expectations to push you into presenting as binary. It\u2019s transphobic as shit, and she had to have known that she was misgendering you every time she introduced you.\n\nShe was being willfully transphobic. If she can\u2019t handle being called out for it, she shouldn\u2019t be engaging in it.", "NTA. Put it/her behind you and live your best life.", "ESH. Everyone was an asshole in this situation. The aunt was being unnecessarily mean to the OP and demanding that they adhere to her standards of what is \"lady-like\" without considering the OP's comfort. The aunt also made a rude comment about the OP's gender identity when introducing them to her family and friends. The OP was understandably angry and lashed out, but their comment was still inappropriate.

All of the lead up would\u2019ve made me snap, but openly using the wrong pronouns knowingly is rude and saying \u2018can you be normal?\u2019 Is insanely rude. You can avoid pronouns completely in conversation if you want. She could\u2019ve just stuck to your name. If she hadn\u2019t repeatedly pushed you you wouldn\u2019t have snapped. She brought this on herself completely and you\u2019re a saint for going along with all that nonsense. Dye your hair you fave colour and watch some of the tv show Feel Good is my advice. Your new aunt sounds rude and entitled", "NTA, and I'm sorry you had to go through that.", "NTA.  Normally, I'd say e s h just because blowing up and causing a scene could have been avoided by more constructive and civil confrontation earlier, and then you wouldn't have had it all bottled up to blow.  But you're 14.  And constructive confrontation is a hard earned skill that a lot of adults struggle with, so I'm saying that you can be excused for the way you handled it.", "Asking anyone to change haircut etc for a wedding is seriously bridezilla/groomzilla.\n\nAsking you in the wedding party and then erasing all that makes you comfortable in your gender seems purposeful bigoted bullying power trip.\n\nYour aunt is a very mean-spirited and a nasty person.\n\nYou were spot on.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your aunt was a total bridezilla. In fact, it was \"her day\", but that didn't allow her to treat you like a doll!\nAnd to tell you to be \"normal\"?!\nWhat is normality ?\nIt's HER normality, not yours, not mine, not everyone elses!\nShe just made proof that she doesn't like you nor respect you the way you are. Period.\nI would personally go NC with that toxic woman", "NTA i think it\u2019s best if you keep the NC.", "NTA but you weren't harsh enough.", "NTA. Your parents should have shut this down. I'm sorry this happened to you.", "I have to agree. NTA, OP. I'm getting married soon (36F) and my best friend is 35NB. They are going to be a brides person in my wedding and are wearing something that makes them comfortable in the colors I picked (which are blue and silver so they're not gendered and are my favorite colors). To ask someone to completely disregard their identity for a wedding is absurd. I'm so sorry you've gone through that and you're 100% justified in your reaction.", "\"Aunt\" also comes across as a LGBTQIA+ phobe and was doing everything in her power to force OP into heteronormative conformity, which is bullying and disgusting. \n\nNTA, OP. Anyone who tells you different is an a-h and doesn't deserve your time, energy, nor presence.", "NTA, OP.\n\nI'm nonbinary, and this comment is exactly right. Your aunt doesn't respect you. She only respects her idea of you, and it sounds like your family is of a similar viewpoint. I hope you can get to a safe, supportive space sooner rather than later, OP. \nAt the risk of sounding like a PSA, it does get better. You were absolutely right to stick up for yourself, and it is worth remembering how these people treated you, even if they improve in the future. (I know lots of people who use any excuse to become less accepting.) You got this, OP! \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\u26a7\ufe0f", "Unfortunately it sounds like their parents were in on it :(\n\nOP is NTA and I hope they're able to escape their bigoted family as soon as they're old enough.", "nta what a _____", "NTA. If she's not speaking to you, it sounds like a happy ending for you tbh.", "Wow.  NTA, OP.  I cannot emphasize that enough.  \n\nYou are a child (I don't mean that condescendingly) and she is a grown ass adult.  She absolutely bullied you into completely erasing your identity for her wedding.  If she wanted a \"lady\" in her wedding, ask a f*cking lady.  \n\nYou conceded waaaaaaay more than any person should.  It isn't as thought you are a \"girly girl\" who wears dresses all the time and just didnt want to wear a green dress.  You are NB.  She forced you to grow out your hair, dye it, wear a dress AND not wear a binder, and so much more crap that was completely unnecessary.   \n\nShe wanted to control you b/c she is a transphobe. \n\nShe abused her power over your kindness.  She is the worst kind of person.", "NTA. And I know you don't like people being mad at you, but take her bigot \ud83d\udc34 not speaking to you as a gift. Nothing good will ever come out of her mouth", "Its been a good year too. Nta. Ridiculous how she treated youm", "This was a real shitty situation for OP.\n\nBut I hope you learned something very important. Don't change who you are for the whims of others. Fuck them, if they don't accept you, they can fuck right off.\n\nThis is also a perfect example of how you can't be tolerant to intolerance.", ">OK, I am willing to give the 14-year-old something of a pass for acting like a 12-year-old. Everyone else though... \n\nThen why ESH?", "Re read the last sentence. I pretty much say that. Hence NTA\n\nAlso it doesn't change the situation, is it harsh to make anyone cry on their wedding day. and OP should have just said no, but acknowledged that they are a child and that they had a lot of pressure.", "That's the idea, yes."]}
