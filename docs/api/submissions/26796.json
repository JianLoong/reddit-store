He has a job and is planning his wedding, but moved back in after college. So I decided it was time. I set a fair rent for our area and expect monthly payments from him, and I fulfill all the duties a landlord would in exchange. He has not shown any opposition to this despite objecting at first, and since he\u2019s an adult I assumed he agreed with me that it is only fair.\n\nTwo or three weeks ago my wife asked me if I had noticed anything off about him, to which I answered no honestly. She said that he had more or less withdrawn from us. So she talked to him and he said he was fine, just tired. She pressed him on the matter and he admitted that he had taken a second job, driving for Uber at night and on weekends, so he could make rent and save for his wedding.\n\nWhen the wife told me, I was honestly proud. I\u2019ve always kind of seen my son as fiscally irresponsible, but here he was doing what it takes to make ends meet. I told her so and she stared at me like I had just grown a third eye. She asked why the hell I was proud to have pushed our son to working nights and weekends to \u201cmake ends meet\u201d. She called me cold hearted and a sociopath, which is just plain untrue- I had just exhibited emotion in front of her.\n\nAnyway, she asked if I was going to give him a break from the rent, to which I said no, because why would I? What landlord would sacrifice their own income like that? She told me that she would start paying his damn rent and stormed off, and she\u2019s been cold and callous to me (ironic) ever since.

They are doing what is common for college-bound younger people to do, which is return home afterwards, presumably temporarily.\n\nYou decided to charge him rent, which based on the wording/context doesnt sound like its vital income for you. It is extra. You were not looking for a tenant prior nor were you then or are you now needing the money from his rent to continue your lifestyle. In the situations where I've heard of that happening, the rent that the child paid is returned to them when they move out as a gift(assuming they were responsible whle living there, didnt damage things, etc)\n\nAfter you found out that your son is working extra hours to save money to balance the rent that you're charging him, that is when you become the asshole. They are saving up for something important. Not a car, not a vacation, but their future wife, your future daughter in law. Why are you charging him rent when you dont need it and its going to actively make it take longer? You get extra fun money, you get extra savings while your child is working more.

You're the asshole for that. You also are charging him the same rate as other places in the area. So if he had known you were going to charge him the going rate of rent, he probably would not have moved back in with you. He moved in with you expecting that his living with you would help him save. Instead, you're a greedy asshole trying to make a huge profit off of him, forcing him to take a second job. Jesus you're an asshole! I live in a higher cost of living area and was paying $1900/month for a whole 2 bedroom apartment with a huge basement.

He's not doing a second job because he's fiscally responsible. He's doing it because his Dad is taking his money. \n\nQuite happy to take the money, though, right?\n\nCharge him rent, sure but if your own son can't get below market rate then you're just doing the \"hard nosed\" thing too hard.", "YTA\n\nWhen you make your child\u2019s life harder than it needs to be for no reason other than \u201c teaching him a lesson\u201d\u2026 your relationship with him will forever be changed and it will suffer. \n\nYour wife is right and I hope she does pay his rent for him\u2026 in another house, that she frequently visits, most likely without you. \n\nWe are here TO HELP OUR CHILDREN. You aren\u2019t helping him though, you are making money off of him when he is already busting his ass to make sure he gets a decent start with his soon to be wife. He isn\u2019t leeching off of you. He isn\u2019t laying around doing nothing. He is working and trying to start a family. He has already proven to you that he is willing to do what it takes by getting a second job. \n\nFor the life of me I can\u2019t figure out what happened to your generation but the sense of\u2026 superiority(?), with that generation is unmatched. I\u2019ve seen more grandparents (50\u2019s-60\u2019s) from that generation insisting that they will not \u201craise their grandchildren\u201d while conveniently forgetting that their parents took care of their children for them sometimes full time for years. It\u2019s the same generation that owns multiple houses as rental properties while their children are working multiple jobs and still not making ends meet all while spewing \u201cit build character!!\u201d It\u2019s selfish and sickening. It doesn\u2019t build character it builds poverty, and resentment.  \n\nIT COSTS MORE NOW THAN IT DID THEN, BY A LOT. \n\nHelp your kids - as much as you can\u2026 and then some. It\u2019s the only thing you will do in your lifetime that\u2019s worth a damn. Everything else is just filler and passing the time.\n\nEdited to add that being proud of yourself for forcing your kid to work nights and weekends in a notoriously dangerous job to pay you rent isn\u2019t an emotion and you could very well indeed be a psychopath. Pride is a secondary emotion, unlike happiness or sadness. All that it requires is a development of your sense of self\u2026 and you seem to have that down well.", "\"I only charge my son entering the work force $1800 for a room\" you're a massive AH wow. Be proud of him all you want but yes going to resent you for this 100%.

If you\u2019re asking him to pay based on the square footage that he has exclusive use of + a proportion of the shared areas x your cost per square foot for your mortgage payment\u2026that would be fair.  He\u2019s probably using 15% or less of your total square footage.  Unless you have a ridiculously expensive house, $1800 for 15% of the space is absurd.  \n\nFor example\u2026at a $4000 mortgage payment, 15% would be $600 a month.

Setting aside the family relationship, let's look at this. It is highly unlikely a single room is worth $1800 in rent, that sounds like studio or 1br prices. You are renting a single room, with shared bath and living spaces. Even in a high cost of living area, that is ridiculous. Single rooms are usually less than $1k, and only get on the higher side if there is a private bathroom, not shared. You are 100% TA here, I'm glad your wife is taking over the rent so she can stop you from taking advantage of your son. Quite honestly, you aren't looking good as a father or a husband in this post.

He has a job and is planning his wedding, but moved back in after college. So I decided it was time. I set a fair rent for our area and expect monthly payments from him, and I fulfill all the duties a landlord would in exchange. He has not shown any opposition to this despite objecting at first, and since he\u2019s an adult I assumed he agreed with me that it is only fair.\n\nTwo or three weeks ago my wife asked me if I had noticed anything off about him, to which I answered no honestly. She said that he had more or less withdrawn from us. So she talked to him and he said he was fine, just tired. She pressed him on the matter and he admitted that he had taken a second job, driving for Uber at night and on weekends, so he could make rent and save for his wedding.\n\nWhen the wife told me, I was honestly proud. I\u2019ve always kind of seen my son as fiscally irresponsible, but here he was doing what it takes to make ends meet. I told her so and she stared at me like I had just grown a third eye. She asked why the hell I was proud to have pushed our son to working nights and weekends to \u201cmake ends meet\u201d. She called me cold hearted and a sociopath, which is just plain untrue- I had just exhibited emotion in front of her.\n\nAnyway, she asked if I was going to give him a break from the rent, to which I said no, because why would I? What landlord would sacrifice their own income like that? She told me that she would start paying his damn rent and stormed off, and she\u2019s been cold and callous to me (ironic) ever since. So I\u2019m wondering I guess, am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
