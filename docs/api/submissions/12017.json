You handled it better than most people would have and that's good enough. If they're those kinda people they're not worth being around anyway", "NTA, are you sure you want to be involved with his family long term, especially when this level of misoginy is baked in?", "That was my thought too lol.

Is it shitty? Absolutely. Doesn't mean that they did it because he's gay. \n\nMy family was also traditional in that sense. \n\nWomen did the side dishes, watched the kids, etc and then men \"manned\" the grill.", "\"Respectful\".   You mean a passive pushover.   Yeah, no.   Sexists and homophobes deserve abrasive call-outs.  And if they don't like like it?  Oh, no! I'm disinvited from the bigots' house.
