It was a private room with a private bathroom in a large historic house, and we were aware that the host had several other rooms in the same house being rented out. Host had over 100+ amazing reviews. When we got to the Airbnb, we realized that there was no way to lock the door from the outside, only a deadbolt on the inside. So we could lock the door only if someone was physically in the room, and otherwise there was just no key. The main door to the house locked with a numeric keypad code, accessible to all the guests staying in the property. My friend said she felt uncomfortable knowing that any random guest could enter our room when we weren't there and take our stuff. \n\nI looked through the Airbnb listing again there was no mention of the lack of a lock (it actually specifically stated that there WAS a lock). We asked another guest who was in the common area if their room could lock and she said no, that she thought it was weird too but she had just been keeping her valuables in her car. My friend and I double checked with the host that there was no way to lock the room, which she confirmed. We decided to leave and get a hotel elsewhere since we weren't comfortable leaving all our stuff in an unlocked room, and the host sent us a snippy message after we contacted Airbnb support. My aunt who runs an Airbnb also thinks we overreacted. I scrolled through the host's reviews and nobody mentioned the lock issue, so now I'm wondering if we truly were just being paranoid. AITA?\n\nEdit: forgot to mention the host did offer to hold onto valuables for us, but we didn't really want to leave jewelry/laptops with a complete stranger either.", "created_utc": 1688781897, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14tqmdd/aita_for_leaving_an_airbnb_because_there_were_no/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's completely unacceptable they couldn't provide you a simple lock.", "NTA.  It's normal to expect to be able to lock your room and keep your belongings secure.  Since it wasn't mentioned in the listing, leaving for a more secure place is fair.", "NTA that's wierd, I wouldn't feel comfortable either", "NTA\nWhy would the host want to open themselves up for liability if someone was assaulted or robbed? You had every right to put your safety first and cancel your stay there.", "NTA\n\nThis is weird to me too.  I don't trust people with my stuff - especially on vacation.\n\nCould you end up being find and no one enters your space and touches your things?  Probably.  Is it worth the added anxiety?  Not to me.  \n\nI'm surprised NO ONE cared that there was no way to lock the door once your belongings were inside.", "NTA and you used good common sense to get out of there. Make sure you leave a review so that other future guests can be forewarned.", "As much as I completely adore \"large historic houses,) I would think a lock is a pretty basic amenity to expect!!", "NTA \n\nIf you aren't comfortable then don't stay. I don't get why the host would be upset unless you two were rude or tried to give her a low ranking due to no lock.", "NTA. You and your friend made a very wise move. You should put that in the reviews for this Airbnb accommodation. Anyone can just walk in and steal your stuff or violate your privacy, which is the last thing you want when you are staying away from home. You have a right to be safe.", "NTA. Locks are minimum requirements.", "NTA Always better safe than sorry and just because there were no comments you could see about the locks it makes me wonder if the host can delete comments they don\u2019t want shown?", "NTA whenever your safety or personal belongings are at risk, especially if you were not told upfront about the risk.", "NTA. This is a security issue. Regardless of any valuables in the room, you wouldn\u2019t want anyone accessing and damaging the area while it\u2019s under your name. The listing should mention the lack of locks or better yet install some!", "Keypad locks are expensive. Sounds like the host was trying to just save money at the expense of their guests' safety.\n\nNTA", "YTA its and AIR BNB youre literally staying in a STRANGER'S HOUSE lmao", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
