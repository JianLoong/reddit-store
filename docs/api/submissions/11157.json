If she\u2019s silent.. it\u2019s because of her inner mind on overdrive. Not because you upset her. I know I would be proud, proud but scared that I didn\u2019t know in time.\nTalk to your mom. She clearly adores you and never second-guess where you stand in her mind. The exact MOMENT she knew you were uncomfortable around him.. He was forever out the door. She is a wonderful mom. And she loves you incredibly. You were not at all wrong to speak up. Her fear will be why it took this long Abe if she failed along the way to make you feel safe to do so. To talk to her.\n*Edited for spelling *", "NTA\n\nThe no hesitation to lose an year old friendship to defend you wow that's how it should be. If only more people had their priorities straight like your mom did, the world would be a better place, and by this you can tell that if she had even an inkling of an idea about what was going on she would have never let it continue.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nW mom", "NTA and that wasn't a choice you got to make. You got to chose to let people know what was happening, how your mum decided to respond to that information was entirely up to her. Your mother is one BAMF and you don't need to feel bad that she lost a friend because she chose protect her kid, and I bet she doesn't feel bad about that one bit either. She is probably devastated this all happened under her nose.", "This mom rocks. NTA. OP go hug your mom. Then do it again for us.", "And that WE appreciate her!", "This may be the real reason for your Mom's sadness - that despite your closeness, you were unable to confide in her. Make sure you reassure you that it wasn't for lack of trust in her that you couldn't do so. Wishing healing to both of you!", "You are absolutely not! You put up with a lot for your mom and you didn\u2019t want her to lose a friendship. However, your feelings matter too!! She absolutely doesn\u2019t seem angry at you in any way and I bet still loves you just the same. Your feelings of discomfort are valid!!", "\"Here mum this is Cee. She is not Dee but she's a step up\"", "I see why your mother is your best friend. Amazing response from her.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA and your mum is a star. ahe had no qualms if having her kids back. \n\nYou didnt ruin a friendship you stood up for yourself ince you were in a place i. your life that you could. \n\nGet yiu mum that potted plant, not many people have a parent like her", "Dude, you did your mum a favour. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou ruined nothing. Your mom knows that as well. Dee's creep of a husband ruined things. Be kind to yourself.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know your mother but I\u2019d bet she isn\u2019t sad about losing the friendship, she is sad that she never saw anything and allowed a creep  in her house for all those years.", "Your mom is cool", "She probably noticed op avoided the creep before and now had the explanation. Nta op and do give your mom a hug, thank her and buy her that potted plant."]}
