I replied that yeah, I started working out.\n\nHer friend made a comment about how that\u2019s too bad because girls are into chubby dad bods now. It was the now part of what she said that sounded odd to me. Did she mean they didn\u2019t use to be into chubby men but now are? So I asked her what she meant by now and she said that as per trends, being fit was out and dad bods were in so girls think dad bods are hot now.\n\nThat honestly sounded so stupid to me I laughed. Not the part about liking one body type or another, but because of her reasoning. Who decides what they\u2019re attracted to based off of a certain body type being in trend now, instead of listening to yourself? That\u2019s just silly. If the trend becomes for example super skinny guys in a year and she\u2019s dating a chubby guy, will she no longer be attracted to him? \n\nShe asked why I was laughing at her, and I said I just find letting changing social trends determine who you\u2019re attracted to is silly. She called me TA for it and stormed off, and her friend apologized and went after her.\n\nIn hindsight, I regret laughing because I would have liked to continue my conversation, but at the same time I don\u2019t think I\u2019m TA.

She made a dumbass comment and got mad when she was called out for it.", "The trends have determined that you're NTA", "NTA If she's going to say something so incredibly shallow while it makes no sense then that's to be expected.", "They were negging you, your response was appropriate. NTA.", "NTA she\u2019s just completely chatting out of her arse and expects everyone to go with it because it\u2019s now the \u201ctrend\u201d they were trying to nag you by insulting your body type and wasn\u2019t expecting the response they got. Good job mate", "After human trafficking and sexual assault a lighthearted post like this ends in NTA", "NTA - your entirely right and make a lot of good sense.", "It sounds like a flippant joke that didn\u2019t land and she reacted after being embarrassed. We all have had moments of saying something stupid in a social situation that doesn\u2019t land and having to process that. Some do it better than others. I think you were NTA but you also weren\u2019t very socially aware yourself. Something you may want to work on. \n\nAs for \u201claughing at someone who trends determine attraction\u201d I can say this is something ver real for a lot of women. One year we are supposed to be stick thin and practically boobless and the next we need Kardashian curves. We are supposed to have thigh gaps one day and bubble butts the next. We are supposed to fit, but only athletic- not muscular.  \n\nSo I agree that it\u2019s dumb to let social trend\u2019s determine reality but unfortunately it\u2019s feels like a reality for many.", "That's some Esm\u00e9 Squalor bullshit lol nta", "Eh. ESH. That was a bit rude of her to say. But she\u2019s not wrong. Beauty standards change. When I was a kid, heroin chic was a thing, ultra skinny girls. That\u2019s what people were into. Now, thicc girls are more mainstream. You\u2019re ignorant if you think that societal norms don\u2019t effect people\u2019s perceptions and attractions to others.", "Honestly, NTA for a couple reasons. 1) The BTS craze is a bit too big for her to be suggesting \"girls are into dad bods right now\" when the lot of BTS' members are lauded...kinda racistly for being \"baby faced\" as well as skinny. Not saying all women or girls are into that, but damn the amount of women who are is staggering. 2) What she said was plain dumb to begin with, it makes her and really anyone who fits her description sound like muppets with little personal opinion that is their own. Like, my tastes haven't really changed since my teens personally. 3) It was kind of a shitty comment from her in general. You're working out for you, and she's over there being like, \"what a waste\"? Girl, the men before you no more exist for your consumption than you do for them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would\u2019ve laughed as well! What a dumb concept", "ESH your reaction was kinda rude/blunt and unnecessarily judgmental, as a general rule of thumb people don\u2019t like to be laughed at or made to feel stupid especially in a casual social setting. \n\nAlso have you never heard of beauty standards? They exist, for a fact. Ultra skinny heroin chic used to be hot, then super curvy, then slim thick etc. For men, the metrosexual look was desirable in early 2000s, then the gym built guys had their time, now dad bods got popular from guys like Pedro pascal and Jon Hamm. Yeah that might not change most peoples personal taste but the concept of being influenced by social standards is not difficult to understand (which is how you acted).", "Yeah, I honestly didn\u2019t expect her reasoning.

That's just what the popular styles are, which are pretty much determined by women.", "I absolutely love your username", "fair", "What reasons do you require for others to be  attracted to someone?", "Exactly, it's just as stupid when men pull it. You work hard on improving yourself, it's never worth it to date people who need to bring you down for their own confidence. Your response of laughing was chefs kiss for that situation.", "The statement wasn\u2019t about who sets the tends.", "Omg you've heard of Gormenghast? I get so excited when I come across someone else who has.", "Preferably something beyond pop culture trends, because those change at breakneck pace. As I said, if the new trend was super skinny guys and she was dating a chubby guy, she\u2019d have to dump him by her own logic", "How about actual attraction and not what's popular or what's in Cosmo?", "> Your response of laughing was chefs kiss for that situation.\n\nThank you, I appreciate it", "The point is that the only people who say women are supposed to be stick thin one year and Kardashian curvy the next are other women. The body types men are attracted to aren't really determined by trends. I imagine it's the same for women as well, and stating otherwise is based on social pressure from other women.", "Women pursue trends. Men pursue women and base attractiveness on the trend of that time. In the 90s & early 2000s, having curves made you unattractive to men who all basically wanted to date Winona Ryder, Paris Hilton body types. Men were deciding on attractiveness based on the trends of the time. But please, continue to disregard my experience.", "You continue to disregard my experience, so why shouldn't I disregard yours? I've never been into stick thin boobless women, regardless of whatever the stupid trend is. Every man I've ever been friends with has had a type and that's what they've been in to, regardless of the trend dujour. Men tend to like what they like, regardless of what other people think.", "And no all women \u2018pursue trends\u2019 at all\u2026\nNever have, never will.", "NTA she was just negging you", "people keep bringing up beauty standards but this is different. changing who you\u2019re attracted to based on beauty standards makes absolutely no sense, as it\u2019s something you cannot control. doing something for the sake of fitting in does, but those things are completely different. and it\u2019s absolutely stupid. \n\nALSO - she put it on herself. putting someone down for having a body type that isn\u2019t \u201cin\u201d right now because YOU like to follow trends and fit in will never be justified imo. especially when someone got fit for themselves and it has nothing to do with you. play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "I don\u2019t think attraction is a static thing. When I was younger I liked the \u201cbad boy\u201d look. Then I started to find older DILF types hot. Other times I started to like clean cut kinds of guys. I think beauty standards can play into attraction because it can make you appreciate different types of beauty/aesthetics which is how I interpreted this girls comment. It\u2019s not a clean cut changing or controlling of what you like, more an acknowledgment that society does have beauty standards that are trendy. People can be influenced by that.\n\nAnd yes I agree with your second paragraph which is why I said ESH and not YTA.", "NTA.  Wtf is that kind of reasoning?  How in the world does that work for her?", "NTA. Her comment is stupid", "Chemistry", "....personal preference, usually? Choosing dates via body trends is kind of weird.", "Idk, green fairy magic sounds good right about now.", "I think to a degree trends do dictate what people are attracted to. Obviously you\u2019ll have your own personal preference but if your constantly told that blue hair is attractive it\u2019s impossible not to be influenced a little given how much advertising we see. \n\nObviously NTA to op and the girl was probably begging him but it\u2019s an interesting idea.", "What the hell are you babbling about?"]}
