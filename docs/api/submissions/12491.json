She has always wanted to be a nurse and has even said that it was her calling. Lately, she has been making horrible remarks about the mothers that come to her.\n\nNow, I understand that every job is going to have its problems and sometimes you need to vent about rude people, management, pay, etc. However, this was not like that.\n\nFor example, she talked about one of her patients, which she referred to as \"white whale\". My sister said that \"white whale\" went into labor and brought her husband with her. She talked about how \"hot\" her husband was and how she could not understand how \"whale\" was able to pull someone like him. She laughed when recalling the sounds she made when pushing out her child, and said that \"she didn't look like the type of woman to be strong enough to go the natural route.\"\n\nIn the past, she has talked about how another mom-to-be defacated on the table, and she remarked that she wouldn't be surprised if her husband divorced her after seeing something \"so nasty\".\n\nOther stories included a teenage patient who \"just couldn't keep her legs closed\". Here, my sister claimed that she gave her \"some sound advice\" and I'm honestly scared to know what she had said to this young girl. With this girl, my sister laughed about she gave her a \"nurse dose\" of pain meds to get her to shut up, and refused to give her a blanket, since \"if she wants to act like an adult, then she deserves to be treated like one.\"\n\nThe fight between her and I happened a few days ago, due to her talking about a mother who delivered a premature baby. She admitted that she told this mother that she should have \"done a better job\" if she didn't want to have a baby born at 29 weeks. I blew up at my sister and asked her how she could be so heartless? My sister told me that she should have the right to vent about \"stupid mothers\" who don't know how to do the thing their body is designed for. She also said that I don't work in healthcare, so I have no right to remark on how she handles stress at work. I told her that if her way of handling stress is to be a misogynist, then she needs to find a different career. I left afterwards.\n\nMy other family members have been divided on this issue. My husband is on my side. My mom and brother think that I was in the right to call my sister out, while my aunt, uncle and dad are leaning towards my sister, saying that my sister shouldn't have to kiss up to her patients in order to do her job efficiently.\n\nI feel bad for some of the things I said and I know that she needs to let off steam, but saying horrible things about women in their most vulnerable  time isn't cutting it for me.\n\nIn addition, my family does not know this yet, but I'm pregnant. And hearing about how my sister, a nurse, is treating pregnant women just makes me scared for labor and delivery. So, AITA?\n\nEDIT: Okay hi everybody. First, thank you all for the advice, support, and the well wishes for our pregnancy. I'm about 11 weeks along right now so I do plan on telling our families in a week or so. \n\nWith the issue regarding my sister, I don't have too many updates yet, other than the fact that my husband and I called the hospital where my sister works and essentially explained what my sister has said about her patients to me. I went into detail about what I could remember and just reported it. They thanked me for letting them know, but I don't know what further action they would take. My sister is taking the night shift tonight, and she has yet to call me screaming, so we will see what occurs in the next few days. I will give you guys an update soon.

You don\u2019t need to work in healthcare to understand that your sister is a massive misogynistic AH.\n\nPlenty of people work in healthcare, and it is  a pretty stressful field by nature.

We go to the doctor, see nurses when we are sick, in pain, scared and vulnerable and allow them to see out naked glory and all the things we hide. Part of that as patients is knowing that the nurses are professional, nonjudgmental, and safe.  If I knew during my pregnancy that I needed to worry about how the nurses saw my body, noises I made during labor, or even my husband, and would judge me and ridicule me behind my back about it- I might not have gotten help for things that were medically necessary. \nI don\u2019t know that it would be right for you to report her at work, but if she is at all not careful then her coworkers are hearing how she talks about her patients too and this will come back and bite her eventually. All that to say, nta, she is toxic and I wouldn\u2019t want her anywhere near me when I feel vulnerable.", "Okay, I *DO* work in healthcare, and your sister should be ASHAMED of herself. As nurses we are there to HELP our patients! A true therapeutic relationship means caring for your patient to the best of your ability, *no matter who that patient is,* to teach them in a way they'll understand and be open to, and to be their advocate. There can be no therapeutic relationship when we go in judging a patient. That is not our job! PERIOD. I have taken care of racists and convicted murderers in my ICU, one even had swastikas prison-tattooed on multiple places on his body, and I hate everything about what they've done and how they think and MY JOB is to still care for them like they were my parent or my child, and that's what I fucking did. Did I want a full-body bleach shower after every single interaction? You bet your ass I did, but it's not my place to communicate that to the patient. \n\nPatients should never fear the judgement of their healthcare providers. How will they trust us to tell us what's really going on if we're too busy mocking or judging them to listen? How can they be sure we'll give them real beneficial advice when they have to worry that they'll become the new punchline in the break room? Much less talking about them outside of work! \n\nHow could that teenage mother trust her to tell her if she's having a problem during her labor? Or to ask about birth control or STIs? Or to tell her if that baby was a product of rape, or if she didn't have anywhere to go after she's discharged, or if she's in an abusive relationship? Your sister is so proud of being horrible to her and refusing to get her a damn blanket of all things that you just know she wouldn't stop to listen, or would just tell her that her problems were her own fault.\n\nOkay, I'm just ranting now, but this kind of shit just pisses me off. Yeah, nurses have to blow off steam, we have to vent our frustrations, but she has a lot to learn about how and when to do that.\n\nYour sister should not be a nurse. Personally I'd report her ass.\n\nNTA! I'm glad you're standing up for her patients because she sure as hell isn't.

And Jesus Christ. I don\u2019t know what to suggest.", "NTA. As a L&D nurse, she totally should be \"kissing up to\" patients, especially those who have early deliveries because I cannot imagine a more stressful thought for a mother than knowing their child is way early and will be incredibly vulnerable for some time to come. I wouldnt technically say she is misogynist, her ramblings sound almost sociopathic. Either way, her mental health seems not to be in a good state and you were totally right to call her out on her vile behaviour.", "NTA but you will be if you don't contact her department head and tell them about this.", "NTA. She's a cruel person and an unfit nurse. She treated a teenaged mother like dirt. How is denying a patient proper meds and a blanket \"treating her like an adult\"? She shouldn't be anywhere near the healthcare field. Your relatives who are on her side are AHs too.", "NTA. Your sister should not be practicing or be allowed around any patients.", "That is jacked up NTA. Women need more support than ever when they are in a vulnerable situation like giving birth.\n\nI know that if someone said those things to my wife when we had out two kids it\u2019s would have devastated her and robber her the joy she needed to get through a very difficult time. \n\nAs a husband and a father I applaud you for standing up for strangers that you do not even know.\nThe world needs more people like you. \n\nAlso a word of encouragement for you. Being pregnant for the first time is a very scary and unknown path. Please do not me to hard on yourself or look at your body and see only bad.\nYou will have many ups and downs but what you are doing is amazing. \nDo not rob yourself of the joy you should feel just because you are worried you do not look or feel like you wanted to while you are pregnant.\nYou can not control everything that happens.\nYou can only try your best so accept that a majority of what happens is out of your control.\n\nAll those negative feelings will pass and you will look at pictures after it\u2019s all over with and realize you actually looked really good and you did enjoy it.\nEven the difficult parts.", "NTA but your sister sure is. Making off color comments here and there and venting are common coping mechanisms but she's in a *care* role.

If you hate mothers so much, go work with someone else. \n\nAlso congrats on your pregnancy!", "NTA. Most of the comments do sound like venting, but some are concerning. I'm not a lawyer, but I would guess that intentionally overdosing a patient (this is what \"nurse-dose\" apparently refers to) in order to shut them up, and refusing her a blanket could be construed as willful malpractice. Also, if she mentions names, this is definitely a HIPAA violation. She really doesn't belong in this field if that is how she conducts herself.", "Report her now , she\u2019s not sucking up or being efficient, she\u2019s a mean spirited person who abuses and bullies her patients , someone is gonna die in your sisters care , she\u2019s a sadist getting off on seeing ppl hurt in her care , she obviously  became a nurse to abuse ppl", "NTA.
