She has a teenager jamie(F14) who comes to visit 2 weekends a month due to court order. \n\nIn the span of our relationship her daughter jamie constantly tries to start fights with us by lying about situations or acting up. (Examples being: I flirt with other woman or the daughter provokes her mom into thinking I lie about my location when I say I'm at work. Lying, manipulation, disrespectful.)\n\nI recently moved my partner Denise into my home and even offered to give Jamie her own master bedroom even though she's never really here. They've lived here for about 3 months and in those 3 months every time Jamie comes she causes issues for us. We also recently found out that Denise is pregnant and high risk. I know having jamie around causes stress for Denise and I'm afraid that my child will be harmed or  be a miscarriage due to all the issues jamie brings. \n \nWe had jamie over for Christmas and she was here for a week. In that week jamie got into several arguments with her mom denise because she doesn't want to pick up after herself or eat food from home. Jamie then went on to call her father and had him argue with Denise over this and she was picked up early. ( we were suppose to have her until after new years.)\n\nDuring one of those arguments my partner Denise had a bad reaction and had to lay down because her body was hurting. AITA for telling my partner I think we're better off not having her daughter come around anymore until the baby is born or at all until she changes her attitude?  [Also jamie was an only child on her mom side until now since Denise is pregnant but her father has 3 other kids. ] \n\nJust confused\n\nEdit: just to clarify if I didn't previously. I'm not worried about myself or how she treats me. I'm worried about the way she acts towards her mother and how she gets her biological father involved and brings him around to fight with my fiance.

Why are you acting like a 14 year old should have the maturity level of an adult? Do you really think that banning her from seeing her mom is going to have any positive outcome? You either need to get on board and start treating her daughter like you would your own child, or do everyone a favor an end the relationship. When you date someone who is a parent it is a package deal and their children are the priority. If this was \\*your\\* 14 year old daughter who was causing problems (like all teenagers do) would you just kick them out because your significant other has another one on the way?

You are having a baby with a woman you\u2019ve only known a year! Teenagers are like this and you can\u2019t expect her to adjust to her parents bad decisions overnight.

Big time", "YTA- gently. \nIf the mom lives with you, and they have court ordered visits, the visits have to happen. Your fiance could do the visits off-site, but she'd still be with her daughter for 2 weekends/month. YTA for suggesting violating a court order.\n\nAdolescents can be horrible. Ones who aren't with their mother full-time and who have forced visitation definitely have issues. I think it helps to think, \"Those who need love the most ask for it in the most unloving ways.\" This girl might feel like her mom is replacing her with a new baby, one that she'll keep. \n\nTry family therapy or mother/daughter therapy before suggesting they violate a court order.", "Your situation is rough\n\nIt is going to take YOU putting in a ton of effort to make it better\n\nTry talking to her alone about the issues.

Why did she need to lay down? \n\nI understand your concern, but everyone else also needs to be on board and Denise should get checked out medically so a plan can be in place for her, her daughter and the other parent. \n\nYelling at a pregnant woman over the phone over basic things like a teenager picking up after herself or feeding herself should not be happening.

She\u2019s a teenager, and it\u2019s court ordered visitation. The only thing that needs to happen here is for Jamie to be in therapy if she\u2019s not already, and maybe for everybody to be in family therapy together.\n\nKids don\u2019t just act like that. She\u2019s going through something and both you and Denise ought to be putting effort into understanding her and how she\u2019s feeling, and where she\u2019s coming from, rather than punishing her or banishing her from staying at her mothers house\n\nI promise that doing that will only make everything 10x worse. I get why you\u2019re worried about the stress with Denise\u2019s pregnancy, but you seem to have a lack of empathy for this kid based on this post", "YTA\n\nThis shouldn't even be an option on the table unless Jaime was extremely disturbed and dangerous, which she's not. She's a 14 year old girl not happy with her mother's new husband. \n\nHave you sat down with them to discuss this? Thought about counselling for blended families? Just because Denise is having another baby doesn't mean she stops being the parent to her first child. You knew the situation before they moved in with you, what made you think it would automatically improve?", "YTA. Denise is Jamie mother and she has a responsibility to be a parent to her child. Even if the court is only allowing it to happen 2 weekends a month. Here is a thought maybe only being able to see her mother 2 weekends out the month is why she is acting out. She could be dealing with feelings of abandonment by her mother or feeling like she is being replaced by you and the new baby. She is Jamie's parent always even if she only has custody 2 weekends a month.", "YTA. Denise can\u2019t just stop being a parent to Jamie just because she has another kid on the way or because teens are sometimes difficult. \n\nIt seems like Jamie is clearly rebelling (her mom moving in with someone else and getting pregnant in the past 3 months, it\u2019s a lot of changes for a teen and now there is talk of her not being welcome at her mother\u2019s home at all??? It\u2019s not hard to see why she\u2019s rebelling). Your wife should however talk to Jamie about her behavior, but something tells me Jamie is feeling replaced and acting out like a typical teen.", "When you started a relationship with Denise you also agreed to treat her daughter like your own. YTA. Y\u2019all need to figure out how to parent this poor kid who obviously needs attention and help. Being pregnant does not give you or Denise the luxury or excuse of having her stay elsewhere. It would probably escalate the situation when the baby arrives. Put on your big boy pants and get your whole family into therapy. 14year olds don\u2019t act out without reason. Figure out the reason. Maybe she\u2019s trying to protect her mom from you.

Counseling may be needed for everyone to restore peace.", "YTA. \"Your\" child doesn't suddenly take precedence over the child your partner already has, and if that's how you think then you should never have involved yourself with someone who has a kid. Soon there will be two kids in the house who need to be loved equally by their mother. Denise can't suddenly stop parenting Jamie because she's going to have a new baby with you or because it's hard. Teenagers rebel, especially during major life changes. She would probably benefit from therapy. If you care about your fiance at all you'll at least pretend you're actually concerned with her daughter's wellbeing.", "YTA. Yes, her daughter is being difficult. You've only been with her mom for a year or so, and mom already moved in with you and is pregnant with another child. That's a lot of change for a teen. It's very natural for children of divorce to dislike their parent's new partner.\n\nBut Jamie is your fiance's DAUGHTER. Her CHILD.\n\n\"Until she changes her attitude\"? I can virtually guarantee that, if you decide to banish her, her \"attitude\" will **never** improve.\n\nI would strongly suggest family counseling. You don't sound prepared to be a step-parent. Your wife and her daughter have issues. Instead of kicking a child out of her mother's life, try investing time and energy into *improving* everyone's relationships. Not destroying them.", "YTA. You can't make your wife cut off her daughter like that. The reason for her attitude could be her parents' divorce and cutting off her like that can amplify that. \n\nI do understand your concern about your wife and child, however you should***talk to your wife about getting her daughter in therapy and not to cut her off.***", "YWBTA and it should only take a minute or two of thinking to land on why. In case you can't see past your own Very Rational nose, imagine you were not step-dad but step-mom and instead of banning her from your home she got to attend a prestigious and far away boarding school for wayward young girls... It's a quick start fairytale!\n\nHow old was Jamie when her parents divorced? Not trying to minimize it, but she's probably lashing out due from feelings of helplessness, uncertainty, and loneliness. The former security of Her Parents & Her has been irrevocably damaged, especially if the divorce wasn't amicable as your post implies with Jamie calling her dad to argue with her mother.\n\nYou are the interloper, further proof how the life she once had is gone. Additionally, her mom is happily married and having a new baby. Denise replaced Jamie's dad with you and is replacing Jamie with your baby. I'm not saying this is factual, but this is very likely some of how Jamie feels. Banning her from your home would just confirm it.\n\nGround rules, repercussions for lying, and therapy to get to the bottom of it and help her in general.", "YTA - Why is it parents on this forum always think that sending away a troubled child away is the solution to everything? 99.9% of parents who post on this forum shouldn\u2019t be parents if this is always their solution. \n\nSending a child away doesn\u2019t solve anything, it just causes more long term issues.", "YTA. Being a step parent is hard. You walk such a fine line it\u2019s exhausting. There are a lot of changes occurring and her daughter feels she\u2019s being replaced. Your relationship is accelerated and you will damage your relationship with your oldest ergo your fianc\u00e9 by continuing this path \n\nFamily counseling would be advisable. Jamie feels very displaced and wants her mother back to herself. She needs validation and boundaries.  You need to learn how to communicate with her. How you think is not how she thinks.  You have a tough road ahead. Displacing your future oldest is the worst thing you could do. \n\nAsk Jamie to have a cup of coffee (or hot chocolate) whichever she prefers because you would like to talk to her. AND TALK. Tell her the truth - you\u2019ve never been a parent before. It\u2019s a learning curve. You\u2019re scared for the new baby and your fianc\u00e9 whom you love dearly. And while you understand that Jamie is having a tough time by her actions - you don\u2019t know exactly because you are not her. You can imagine, you can\u2019t know for sure. What you do know is that while you are not her father, you are going to be a father, you want to be a good one and it would sure help if you could start by maybe try to be friends?  You don\u2019t expect to be besties in a day\u2026 maybe try and work together to create a better home environment for everyone. She matters too bc she lives there and what happens affects her too. She should have a say to help navigate this new family dynamic.  Is there any ideas you both could put together to see how things could work better?  \n\nI think hearing that she matters to the new family means a lot. She isn\u2019t losing her mom, she\u2019s getting a new sibling and a new family member. You\u2019re not trying to force an immediate bond - maybe some mutual respect of two people that desperately love the same person and want said person to be healthy and happy. I\u2019d say that;s a nice foundation to start with.", "NTA unpopular opinion but if she is lying and making up things saying he is cheating... It may be only a matter of time before she accuses OP of something worse that could potentially ruin his life permanently. You have every right to voice your concerns.

You don\u2019t have the right to prevent that girl from seeing her mother. And frankly you should have thought about all of this before a) moving Denise into your home and b) not using protection and getting her pregnant.

That's a myth. \n\nWhy does Denise only have her daughter two weekends a month? \n\nI'm going to guess that the limited time with her mom plus moving in with you and now having a new sibling on the way is making her feel like she's totally losing her mom. You need to do what you can to assure Jamie that she has a solid place in your family.", "Yta. You have a right to be upset about her behavior, but fixing that involves communication and maybe some counseling. Not trying to abandon her.

She has a teenager jamie(F14) who comes to visit 2 weekends a month due to court order. \n\nIn the span of our relationship her daughter jamie constantly tries to start fights with us by lying about situations or acting up. (Examples being: I flirt with other woman or the daughter provokes her mom into thinking I lie about my location when I say I'm at work. Lying, manipulation, disrespectful.)\n\nI recently moved my partner Denise into my home and even offered to give Jamie her own master bedroom even though she's never really here. They've lived here for about 3 months and in those 3 months every time Jamie comes she causes issues for us. We also recently found out that Denise is pregnant and high risk. I know having jamie around causes stress for Denise and I'm afraid that my child will be harmed or  be a miscarriage due to all the issues jamie brings. \n \nWe had jamie over for Christmas and she was here for a week. In that week jamie got into several arguments with her mom denise because she doesn't want to pick up after herself or eat food from home. Jamie then went on to call her father and had him argue with Denise over this and she was picked up early. ( we were suppose to have her until after new years.)\n\nDuring one of those arguments my partner Denise had a bad reaction and had to lay down because her body was hurting. AITA for telling my partner I think we're better off not having her daughter come around anymore until the baby is born or at all until she changes her attitude?  [Also jamie was an only child on her mom side until now since Denise is pregnant but her father has 3 other kids. ] \n\nJust confused\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There is very obviously more to this story as your wife lost primary custody of her only child and is court ordered to see her daughter. \n\nThe conversation should be between your wife and her ex. Through a lawyer if they are not allowed contact. It is not YOU that has to deal with the ex. It\u2019s your wife. \n\nI\u2019m sorry her daughter is caught in the middle of what appears to be a nightmare scenario", "YTA. Jamie doesn't like you. Here are the most common reasons (but not all, b/c there are hundreds of possibilities): 1. She resents you b/c she doesn't get her mom's attention anymore 2. Her dad is riling her up against you 3. You have made her feel unwelcome 4. You are a jerk.\n\nBased on your post and the fact that she wants to leave as soon as she gets there, I'm going w/ 2 & 3. Why? A. You think offering her her own room is being  overly accomidating to her - seriously? Are you kidding? She lives there almost 1/2  time - of course she should have her own room and it should be a good room, not the broom closet. Yeesh. B. You think  it is perfectly reasonable for your fiancee to abandon  her 14 yr old daughter. FYI - you are more disposable than her daughter. \n\nYou had a choice to persue a relationship w/ a woman w/ a kid and you chose to have her move in, get engaged and get pregnant fully aware the daughter did not like you - at all. Your step-daughter had absolutely no choice in any of these decisions.

Have a heart-to heart with Jamie about the risk of stress  in the pregnancy \n2. Come up with behavioral consequences \n3. Talk with father about other Jamie\u2019s behavior and if he didn\u2019t like it, explore him having majority custody and weekend visits \n\nObviously Jamie is a teenager and we all know how that goes, but allowing her no repercussion especially with a new baby coming is the worst thing to do..\nGood luck to you OP", "NTA.

I don't think you really want her to stop having her daughter over just because it's inconvenient, but I believe you're frustrated and completely confused. It's a shitty situation and the daughter, even at 14, is an asshole with the lying and all. She may still be young but she is quite old enough to know she shouldn't be doing those things.

But she's 14 and has some grasp on how relationships work, and what to say to cause tension.\n\nShe might be going through some stuff from her parents' separation, but since you and your partner are not Jamie's primary parents it is absolutely neither of your jobs to have to endure behavior like that.", "YTA, and honestly this sound like a great parenting lesson. \n\nShould your child no longer be allowed to visit Denise if her new partner so deems it for the sake of their child?\n\nIs the new somehow more or less Denise\u2019s to care for??\n\nJust because Jamie isn\u2019t your priority, doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t a top one for Denise.

And we certainly don't encourage our kids to be slamming doors and giving rudeness. \nIf Jamie wants to continue down the path of lying them she's going to have to live with the outcome. \nYour wife is just trying to maintain a mother daughter relationship with her.
