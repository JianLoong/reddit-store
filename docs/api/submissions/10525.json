She also has a partner who she lives with.\n\nThere is no divorce settlement and they don\u2019t have any kids together.\n\nThe reason he tells me he sends her rent money and has been doing for 4 years since their divorce \n, is because she isn\u2019t well and can\u2019t get a job. The plan was to stop sending it her when she gets a job.\n\nWe have had a conversation about this saying it makes me uncomfortable for our future, and he has said that he will start reducing the amount he gives her. However now he has said that her health is getting worse and she is begging him not to reduce it, so he didn\u2019t last month when he was going to start reducing. It is sounding like this won\u2019t ever stop because her health isn\u2019t going to get better. \n\nWe split everything 50/50 and are trying to save for a future together, but this sets everything back.\n\nThis makes me uncomfortable thinking about the future, getting married and having kids, I don\u2019t know if I am over reacting for this.", "created_utc": 1676951567, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117to5n/aita_for_making_my_boyfriend_stop_sending_money/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s foolish.\n\nDo not make a future with this man under the assumption that he will stop helping his disabled ex-wife financially.

I wouldn't want to plan a future with someone who would be bringing the past like this along. It would be different if there were kids, a legal obligation - but there's not.

You can give your opinion. But don\u2019t make demands. Save your money right now for only you. If she is due any money she should have addressed it prior to the divorce. Had it court ordained. I suspect that she wasn\u2019t due any alimony or if, only short term. If he stops payments, then she can take it to court, whatever and have the court decide how much. Which should have been done from the start but again, suspect the ex knew he was clueless and an easy target. Unwell is so generic. In her case, instead of money aka cash, if boyfriend knows she actually needs something then he just buys it and gives it to her. I wouldn\u2019t be happy with live ins being assisted along with her.

Not everyone who is sick and supported by family is faking it. I'd like to know (if you know) what her diagnosis is ( really none of my business - or yours) sounds like he's very compassionate and you're lucky to have him. Does she interfere with your relationship in any other way? Is she an ex wife or girlfriend? If she's an ex-wife, especially if she's sick, she seems like she didn't go after half of what he has and is trying to be cool. Unless there's info about the situation you left out, yeah, YTA.

Don't stay in a relationship like this, he's harming your financial future.  It's not alimony, he's just a stupid sucker falling for a con by his manipulative ex wife.

If you don\u2019t feel comfortable building a future with him because of this, it is understandable and you\u2019re well within your rights to end the relationship. However, he has been willingly helping a struggling person since before you were in the picture. I don\u2019t know which country you live in, but most places don\u2019t exactly have a robust social safety net for people with disabilities. He freely consents to helping this person. Put yourself in her shoes and ask how disempowering it must feel to have to depend on the kindness of an ex partner just to survive.

What % of his income goes to her versus your joint expenses, do you feel the immediate effects of this or are you just bothered by the arrangement?

If he is unwilling to break communication and stop sending money to his ex, I would suggest counseling.  It seems that he does not respect you enough to care about your feelings on the matter.

I fear it would built resentment in me as I\u2019m putting all of my money into our future and a big proportion of his is going to an ex partner.", "Then why is your boyfriend still helping his ex if she now has a new partner too who can help her?", "Then it gets a bit thornier, because you don\u2019t have standing to tell him how to spend his own money, but I can understand why it makes you feel bad. Does he overly accommodate her in other ways, or is it just the money? Does he know how it makes you feel, and do you know why it\u2019s important to him? For judgement, I\u2019m going to say NAH, but sounds like you have some long conversations ahead of you to figure out whether this relationship has the ability to go the distance."]}
