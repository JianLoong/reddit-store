I told him that Iris is still my goddaughter, and he never asked me to stop inviting her to events which I host. He said that he was fine with me going to lunch and shopping and getting nails done with Iris, but he was hoping to invite his new girlfriend Violet to dessert and that it would be awkward for her to eat something baked by Iris.\n\nI told Adam that he never asked me about inviting his girlfriend, and that it was rude to spring this on me so suddenly. Adam replied that a good mom would stand by her son, and not some girl who's not even my real kid.\n\nI told Adam to go to his room and not come out until he apologizes for his disrespectful attitude. Then basically told him the title, and he shouted that I'm the one disrespecting HIM.\n\nAdam has refused to speak to me for the rest of the night, and I fear that I may have ruined Thanksgiving.\n\nI stand firm that Adam has never raised the issue until now, and I think that he is trying to be petty because Iris already knows that his new girlfriend is her cousin.

I did not consider my son's feelings when inviting Iris. However, she has attended our holiday meal for years now. He has never raised an issue about her until now, which leads me to believe that he wants to snub her or cause drama.\n\n2. I never clarified how he felt after the breakup, though he barely seemed bothered by it.

Secondly, she\u2019s your goddaughter and you\u2019re clearly a mother figure to her.

I mean, they\u2019re broken up and he can date whoever, but something about dating your ex\u2019s relatives when there are SO MANY people out there\u2026 it just rubs me the wrong way.

Your son should have realised that she would be present if things didn't work out and, if need be, not dated her.", "NTA. In fact, I\u2019d like to hug you for being such a great person.

It's a good lesson in not shitting where you eat for your son.", "NTA, I would like to say you shouldn't refer to her as your son's ex, because that's actually not your primary relationship with her. She's not just some girl your son dated and that you latched on to, she's been a family friend since she was born, him trying to exclude her now because he dated her is stupid. He literally shouldn't have dated her if he wasn't prepared to deal with her for the rest of his life.\n\nHim trying to exclude someone entirely because he is insecure and wasn't prepared for the actual implications that come from having dated someone in the family circle is his problem. Do not disinvite her from Thanksgiving. And I would say, even if Violet is nice, you should afterward have a real firm conversation with your son about his poor behavior, and how disrespectful it was that he invited someone to your event without telling you first. Violet maybe lovely, but he does not get to disrespect you and Iris and say that it's all for Violet's benefit.

Maybe a check in a couple of weeks ago mentioning that ex gf was coming for Thanksgiving , like prior years and that you wanted to give him a heads up.  He\u2019s thinking of her as an ex and you are a family friend/god daughter.

She may not be your blood, but she is family with the commitment you made with her late-mother and her!\n \nvs Violet is a complete stranger.", "NTA for the situation at hand, but I think you have bigger issues here. Two things I picked up on in your post are that you consider Iris a second child and that your son wants you to pick him over someone who \u201cisn\u2019t even your real child\u201d. It\u2019s telling he made that distinction. I think he wants to be sure that when push comes to shove, you\u2019ll pick him. He\u2019s a 16 year old boy, so my guess is there are some bigger feelings here than he has shared, and this situation is the culmination of them. The only way forward is to get him to open up and work through the issues.", "NTA. You have every right to invite your goddaughter who lost her mother. I imagine that holidays are hard for her. Keep doing you. If he wants to sit in his room all alone listening to Panic! At the Disco... let him.", "Nta. She\u2019s been there for years, it would be so rude and weird for you as her godmother to uninvite her just because you and her son broke up. She might be his ex, but she\u2019s also your god daughter and that\u2019s arguably more important", "Nta.", "NTA\n\nShe was a family friend long before she was (briefly) your son's girlfriend.   Teenagers probably dont think too far ahead (what if this doesnt work out?)  You had no idea that inviting her would present a problem for him based on them being cordial at your bday party.  Nor did you know he was inviting a girlfriend.  He seems to make lots of choices with potentially awkward consequences (now dating the girl's  cousin!)  Maybe he will outgrow this phase at some point!", "NTA\n\nShe is your godchild, their breakup was amicable and she has been a part of your family far longer than they dated\n\nWhile Adam did not tell you he invited his new gf, is assuming his gf will feel a certain way, (seriously who cares who baked a pie?) and is now dating his ex's cousin. If anyone made things weird he did.", "NTA\n\nThis is all really unfortunate, but he really has to learn to clear these things with you first.  It just sounds like he made a bunch of assumptions, and they were all wrong.", "NTA - He should have brought it up earlier. It\u2019s almost a tradition for you all to spend thanksgiving together, he\u2019s acting childish for some reason. Maybe he didn\u2019t want to confront the weird situation he\u2019s put himself in and now it\u2019s coming to head\n\nYou wanting to spend a holiday with your loved ones is not wrong at all", "NTA : after 4 years in a row he must have known she would be invited and before inviting anyone to a family celebration that he is not hosting, he should have asked. It is almost like he is creating his own little soap opera. He may be hurting, but not the Mom's fault. NTA", "NTA. He should have informed you that he was bringing an extra guest, whether or not he's dating them. Plus she's pretty much family. He doesn't get to dictate that.\n\n\nAlso I read in another comment that he's dating Iris' cousin?? Yeesh.", "NTA\n\n1) She was your goddaughter before she was his girlfriend.\n\n2) No reason new GF still can't come (other than the fact that he can't invite people without telling the host and cook).\n\n3) There was no cheating, fraud, abuse, etc. involved.\n\n4) They're teenagers, and this relationship lasted less than a year. This does not deserve the same gravity as a multi-year long committed relationship between adults that left someone putting their life back together and starting over.", "Don\u2019t let you son gaslight you. He\u2019s not a man. He\u2019s not an adult. He\u2019s a child and acting like it, and in his immaturity and irrationality, he\u2019s turned to manipulating you. My red flag meter is going off on that, especially since he\u2019s so young. You\u2019re not in the wrong, and have been understanding and supportive of him. You even said he never expressed to you 1. To not invite her and 2. He was inviting someone else. She\u2019s only his ex RECENTLY. She was your goddaughter first and longer, and has been going for years. Did he really not see this coming? Notice his word choice in saying, \u201cwhy did you invite MY ex\u201d? Get him in check. YOUR the parent. A child shouldn\u2019t be making you doubt yourself enough to have made this post when it\u2019s so clearly cut and logical what you\u2019ve laid out.  He\u2019s insecure about his new and old girlfriend meeting and can\u2019t take 2 seconds to be mature and work it out and act like a polite human to you and during thanksgiving? The disrespect. NTA.\n\nEdit: he just started dating this new girl, right? In what world does he think that a brand new girlfriend trumps a years long close family friend? The solution here is him not inviting the new girlfriend, but he\u2019s clearly too selfish and instead made you somehow seem like a bad guy that needed to make the sacrifice of not inviting someone.", "NTA- he didn\u2019t even ask you if his new gf can come", "Ooph. This isn't an easy one. I'm going to say NTA with the caveat that you kind of navigated this issue in an ineffective matter. You're right, Iris should be there and you shouldn't waver on that.\n\nHowever, instead of hammering him with technicalities about invites and telling him, \"tough shit, deal with it,\" you should have instead validated his feelings and discussed with him in a manner that would allow him to open up about his concerns without you immediately shutting him down. By coming at him so hard about it, he's reciprocating by digging his own heels in and shutting you completely out emotionally.\n\nSo I'd go to him and apologize for being cold and not respecting his feelings and then approach this from a much softer angle to figure out a way where he feels secure about Iris being able to come over without it blowing up his relationship.", "NTA\n\nAlthough Adam is still a teenager, and his thinking is immature, he's learning big life lessons. He chose to date your goddaughter, who you have considered as your daughter for years. Iris has spent thanksgiving with your family for years. Adam is acting out of pocket thinking that these relationships would change just because he's not dating Iris any longer. The world and your relationship with Iris doesn't revolve around Adam. You don't need his permission to continue your relationship with Iris. \n\nAdam is also learning, that he has to ASK if he can invite friends or a girlfriend over. He's not hosting/cooking, in fact it sounds like he's doing nothing to help out. Yet he thinks he can make decisions about the guests and invite his girlfriend without a heads up. \n\nI think you need to sit down with Adam and explain this to him, because he's clearly nit grasping these lessons on his own.\n\nAnd call him out on his \"a good mother would\" manipulative BS. Cut that line of thought immediately. He can't do that kind of mind playing to get his way.", "NTA\n\nYou had a relationship with her all before he started a new one and ended it in a meagre 8 months, nothing changed. Nothing changed for him either, except now when he thinks his current gf would have a problem. Now it's on him to explain why his ex has a relationship with his family, and there's nothing he can do about it.", "NTA - your relationship with her predates her dating tour son. You are probably some of the closest family she has and it would be cruel to toss her aside now.", "NTA. Agree your son is being petty.", "NTA.  You don\u2019t, and didn\u2019t, tell him who he can date.  He knew iris was family before he dated her.  He is rude for inviting someone without telling the host. He is rude for demanding the host to change the invitation list he needs to grow up. You are correct and all of this.", "NTA. This isn't just a son's ex that you grew close to while they dated (not that that wouldn't also be a fair invite), she's your goddaughter, the goddaughter of your deceased best friend. You've been in her life since she was born and she's attended the last several Thanksgivings. Adam dated her knowing that she was already a significant part of your/the family's life. Dumping this (and a surprise dessert guest!) on you last minute is immature and obnoxious, honestly. \n\nHe's a kid so it's understandable, but I wouldn't feel guilty at all. If you did disinvite Iris 1) she'd likely have nowhere to go for thanksgiving and 2) that sends a pretty clear message that by going through a mutual breakup she's lost her godmother, a family she grew up with and her thanksgiving tradition for the last few years.", "NTA\n\nWhen teenagers are being unreasonable, your only hope is to maintain your reasonable boundaries.\n\nYour goddaughter has no mom and has been coming to Thanksgiving for years. She's also son's ex, but they've been at social events together since the breakup, and been fine. Therefore, Iris should still be invited to Thanksgiving.\n\nAs for new gf:  It was wrong of son to invite her without permission. I learned that lesson when I was about six, although I won't swear I didn't forget it once or twice when I was a hormone-addled teenager. You are cooking, so you get to decide if gf is actually invited. Maybe she's invited if son apologizes sincerely for inviting her?\n\nAfter that, you have invited whomever you invited. They can choose whether to attend or not.\n\nSon may not like it, but you'll know you acted within your rights and proper boundaries, and that's all you can do. If Thanksgiving doesn't go smoothly, have backup activities ready for after the meal to either be alone or to hang with whichever attendees are being reasonable.", "[deleted]", "NTA. He needs to grow up and get over himself.", "NTA. He should have asked in advance. Tell him next year or Christmas if he gets his mind right.", "Both of you are. You should have at least spoken to him about it first. You were aware of their relationship. He definitely Should have asked you if he could bring someone to dinner. This is a matter of miscommunication.", "ESH\n\nI get that you\u2019ve always invited her, but they broke up this year. A heads up to your son that you were still going to invite his ex would have been appropriate. He\u2019s got a point that you catching up with Iris and him remaining cordial with her in passing is different to her being at a small family event with the two of them forced to be in close proximity.\n\nHe should have asked about his girlfriend. And I\u2019m not even gonna touch the whole cousin thing. Oof.", "YTA and honestly it does seem like you\u2019re taking sides. You could have warned Adam, duh. These are teenagers and you\u2019re the adult, and you made a few assumptions here.\n\nIf you really consider both of these teenagers your children, you should have made a plan that protected them when they started dating because they would inevitably break up. Iris has been coming to your house for holidays for ten years and you didn\u2019t think this might make things awkward?\n\nAlso, it\u2019s weird you didn\u2019t check in with Adam when he started dating Iris\u2019 cousin. Do you guys live in a really small town that only has two families in it? You really thought your two children would break up and not be bothered, even when the cousin came into the picture? \n\nAdam could have checked in about his guest, but if I had a mom who invited kids my age to important holidays without asking me I\u2019d honestly assume it was fine for me to do so also. I know Iris isn\u2019t just any kid but why should Adam be expected to treat her like a sister when they just broke up?", "NTA. Teenager is being an entitled dickish teenager. Keep that foot down. I hope Iris\u2019s dessert is delicious.", "NTA. \n\nI'm super confused. I don't have godparents or godchildren, but is it common for biologic and godchildren to date each other? \n\nThank you for hosting your goddaughter and making sure she has a place to go on Thanksgiving. Good person award.", "You should really speak to Adam about dating his ex\u2019s cousin.", "ESH.  It is no one\u2019s fault that your goddaughter and your son dated and subsequently broke up.  But it changed the dynamics of your familial group.  And you can\u2019t just ignore that.  You are wrong to just assume your son would be fine with you continuing to act as if their relationship never happened.  Your son is wrong for not expressing to you his issue clearly and acting immaturely.\n\nI am not saying you have to cut off your relationship with your goddaughter, but for the time being at least you may have to change it.  This Violet may not be serious, but what happens when your son or goddaughter do get seriously involved with someone?  Maybe if they are 25 when that happens,it won\u2019t be an issue.  But if it happens in the next year or two, you are likely going to sit through some very uncomfortable meals.  Before you make any plans that involves both of them, you should clear it with both of them.", "I\u2019m going against the grain here and say YTA. And it\u2019s not because of this situation about the dinner. You say they grew up like siblings, then they dated?  That completely changes the dynamic. You need to respect your son\u2019s wishes that he can date other people. Just because he didn\u2019t mention it until now, it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s trying to make your goddaughter upset. \n\nThis goes beyond this holiday. You need to both figure out how to move forward and create new boundaries. Ignoring the issue won\u2019t fix anything and this will just keep happening until one of them decides to break off contact with you.", "So you put a friend above your son.\n\nNice move, yeah.\n\nYTA", "[removed]", "Yta your a shitty ass parent don't be surprised if your son goes no contact with u", "INFO: do you not approve of his new girlfriend?
