We have been together for two years. My fiance was not close with his family growing up at all. In the two years we have been dating I have only met his parents like 3 times.  That doesn\u2019t bother me, like I said, he has a lot of resentment due to his upbringing and just doesn\u2019t particularly like spending much time with them. Nothing bad happened to him on their part but outside of his basic needs being taken care of there was little emotional support. \n\nMy fiance was given a terminal diagnosis a few months ago with a two year life expectancy. Treatments are not an option so we are just living life to the fullest. After he learned of his illness he and his family have gotten a bit closer in that they see each other more often. \n \nHis family (very very wealthy) gifted us our honeymoon as our wedding gift. My husband and I chose puerto Vallarta because we wanted a relaxing resort vacation and to go snorkeling together. One last boujee trip for our bucklist. But - his parents also chose the dates of the honeymoon without asking us. So they chose to book the trip so that his birthday was during it. Then they said they wanted to spend his last birthday with him, so they also will be joining us. They did get their own suite at the resort, and both of his siblings got rooms at the resort too. Dont get me wrong, I am really grateful they are gifting us this experience. But im annoyed they deliberately made it during a time that they could conveniently join our HONEYMOON. I know he is sick, and I know they want to spend time with him. My fiance won\u2019t say anything to them because he doesn\u2019t want to fight with anyone during his final time here (which I understand)! I think I just wish they could have booked a separate trip for the family to go on rather than during our honeymoon, a time that we could have spent together alone- which honestly we get rarely these days. Between hospital visits and seeing friends and checking off things he wants to experience, we are pretty busy! Like I mentioned earlier, money is not an issue and could easily have been made into a separate trip, but they CHOSE to make the trip during his birthday so they had the excuse to join in. When they told us that they were also coming on the trip, I said that was a little strange. Now they are mad at me for not understanding how important it is for them to spend my fiances birthday with him. The entire family thinks that I am wrong for being upset about this. His parents have said I will barely even see them so I shouldn\u2019t be upset. But we are all staying at the same resort, with rooms right next to each other.

Treat it as such. If they\u2019re paying, great. Enjoy it. Then go on your own honeymoon with just your spouse. Overall while it\u2019s a weird situation, I get that they\u2019re desperate to squeeze out every last enjoyable second they can before they lose their child. NAH", "Call it his birthday trip, and book a honeymoon somewhere else either before or after this trip, and pick something you can pay for yourselves.", "I'm sorry to hear of your partner's diagnosis.\n\nThat said, if your partner's family is paying for the trip, you don't really get to dictate the terms of the trip (as with any other gift). Does it suck that they offered a honeymoon trip - which most people would reasonably assume would be the two of you - and then planned to join? Yeah, sure. \n\nMy advice? Enjoy what sounds like a very nice trip, then plan a separate honeymoon. If the timing is important to you and they planned the trip at the time that you and your partner really wanted a solo honeymoon trip, it's fair to ask for the trip to be another time to allow you two to enjoy a honeymoon (that you'd pay for yourselves).\n\nNTA, I get wanting an actual honeymoon trip, but again, doesn't have to be *this* trip - so I wouldn't push that point. Hopefully you can all give each other some grace in a really sad circumstance.", "INFO: What does your fianc\u00e9 want?\n\nIf he wants them there, I\u2019m sorry OP, but the man who is dying gets the final say", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s totally understandable why you are upset. This is your honeymoon and it should be what you & your husband want. \n\nUnfortunately, this is his family\u2019s way of making amends for not being there for him emotionally as he was growing up. They should have asked you and your husband what you wanted. But they aren\u2019t being rational. Grieving often begins before the loss occurs, and can make people make emotional decisions. \n\nIt sounds like your husband really does not want to push the issue. Because of that, and because of the importance of keeping the peace in the time he has left\u2026I\u2019d plan a separate honeymoon with him and not tell any family members. If you\u2019re able to do this prior to the family trip, it may make the trip with them more enjoyable. \n\nI\u2019d also recommend talking with a grief counselor during this process if you\u2019re not already. If his family is trying to make up for lost time, this may not be the last issue that arises. \n\nThoughts are with you OP, this is a very difficult situation.", "NAH. This situation is not the typical honeymoon situation. \n\nI think it's understandable that you're annoyed but it's also understandable that his family would want to make some great memories with him before they lose him.\n\nThe worst thing that could happen would be for your husband to have to witness you and his family fight over him and how distressing that would be for him. Those aren't the kind of memories anyone wants to be making.", "NAH\n\nJust stop calling it your honeymoon and consider it a family trip. Schedule and pay for your own honeymoon with just the two of you. It's ok to be frustrated, but considered it's a massively expensive GIFT from them, I would swallow the frustration and be grateful for the free vacation. Just do something else with just the two of you for your honeymoon.", "Treat this as a last family vacation. Go on a Honeymoon at a later date, just the 2 of you", "NTA however just call it what it really is, a family vacation. Plan something away for just the two of you & call that your honeymoon instead.", "NAH - I get that this is supposed to be your honeymoon and therefore don't want the in laws around. But if I'm reading this right you are getting married around your husband's bday and as such will be gone on his bday, and his parent's want to spend what might be his last bday with him. Could you see about not having rooms right next to each other. Because if that's the case you literally might only see them when at designated meet up times (ex, dinner). Or IDK how much vacation time and disposable money you have or anything like that, but if it's possible maybe use this as a family vacation and then fly from there to your actual honeymoon vacation or even look into staying a few days longer than what the in laws will be there for.", "NTA but given the circumstances I\u2019d follow your husband\u2019s wishes. How about you plan a small weekend getaway separate from this one for just the two of you? It won\u2019t be Puerto Vallarta but you\u2019ll be together and can spend quality time alone and no one needs to know that you consider that your real honeymoon and not the family trip!", "So, his parents chose the dates to book a vacation for his birthday.\nThis isn't your honeymoon. It's a family vacation. \nSince money isn't an issue, I suggest booking an actual honeymoon. \nAll of you only have two years left with this person.", "I'd say NTA. It's a bit weird that they want to come on a honeymoon with you, but given the circumstances, I guess I get it? But still, it's understandable you guys would want some time and space alone. Maybe there would be a way to work out a compromise with them? Seems like everyone here is just trying to make sure they have no regrets once the end comes for your fiancee. Hopefully, there's an answer that works for everyone. \n\nI'm sorry you're in this overall situation, and I hope the best for you, your fiancee, and your guy's family.", "NTA, but just consider this a birthday trip and tell your fiance that you'll be expecting to take a real honeymoon with him during a time that isn't his birthday where it is just the 2 of you. Doesn't have to be expensive. Book a cabin in the woods with a hot tub and enjoy some alone time.", "I won't judge this. Your fianc\u00e9e has a time limit, and a lot of people that he needs to spend time with while he can. I don't know what his diagnosis is, so I don't have any idea how long he will be able to live an active life, but combining events seems prudent at this point. Try to make sure you get some alone time, let his family know that that is important to you, but understand that this is hard for everyone, and let him bask in the people who care about him for as long as he can, and as much as he can. whatever the diagnosis was, I hope he beats it, and you get to live a long and happy life together. But, since it seems unlikely, try to make the most of the time you have, build memories, and build a solid relationship with his family if you can. You will all need each other for comfort in a couple of years.", "NAH\n\nWow! This is a hard one. I would step back from calling this a honeymoon and maybe treat it more as a family vacation (or celebration). The very last thing your fianc\u00e9 needs or wants is to be a cause of familial tension in his final months.\n\nYou mention his family is quite wealthy. Perhaps you could talk with them and your fianc\u00e9 (and his doctors) about what\u2019s going to happen over the next year or so and plan several bucket list adventures or activities for him - some with just the two of you and they may join in others. This could include visits to childhood haunts or long lost friends.\n\nTake his health into consideration so perhaps a bit more active early on and maybe more cruises later. View it as a celebration of his life - not a farewell tour. And continually reevaluate the plans to make sure it\u2019s all positive rather than overwhelming. Just being there for him is what\u2019s important - not where you go.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re struggling through this. I certainly wish you the very best of luck and as much quality time with your fianc\u00e9 as possible.\n\nI lost my sister last summer - she had been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer ~1 year prognosis. We planned multiple outings with her - especially with her niece, but they never really came to fruition as the end came so much faster than anyone thought. While I wish we\u2019d had more time, I was deeply touched and honored to help her through her struggles too. Even more meaningful than the trips would\u2019ve been. Truly cherish and celebrate the time you have left together now - especially the quality time.", ">just wish they could have booked a separate trip for the family to go on rather than during our honeymoon,\n\nUnderstandable, completely understandable.  Yet, it seems like they are thinking this will be his (and their) last opportunity to spend his birthday with him. It's not ideal, but I suggest you speak to your in-laws and discuss giving you and your new spouse time **alone** together. Maybe you can spend the day together and have dinner at night with them or vice versa.", "Just take your own honeymoon. Keep this trip as a family trip and plan your own honeymoon. Don\u2019t tell them about it til you\u2019re back.", "I think that if this is a recognized bucket list thing: if your husband didn't want them there he'd be adamant that they not come. They've grown closer by your own admission and their time together is something he's valued enough to make a reality. Please don't put him in the position to force him to make a zero sum choice here based on your own feelings if you want to help him make the most of his time here.\n\nYou're NTA for your emotions at all and I'm sorry yall are having to navigate these tough waters together.", "NTA. They do not get to make his decisions for him and should have checked with both of you first. I understand wanting to spend the time with him, but it needs to be run by him first. It sounds like he agrees with you on this point. Maybe you can make a request with the staff to be on a different floor from them for a little more separation, and plan for some activities outside the resort with just your husband.", "NTA. But call the resort and ask for another room.", "NTA, it's weird. So you know what I'd do? Take this as a free holiday and book your own separate honeymoon, another time. Don't tell them in case they try to crash it again. \n\nReally sorry for the position you're in, enjoy the time you have left together.", "NTA its super weird they want to go on his honeymoon. I would just treat it as a regular vacation and go on a separate honeymoon.\n\nOne question though. They said its okay because you will hardly see them, if they will hardly be seen what is the point of them going on the honeymoon with you?", "NAH\n\nGiven the situation and what his time being active is very short I get family wanting being close during happy times\n\nIt\u2019s a vacation, enjoy time with him.", "**NTA**\n\nHis family probably feels guilty for treating him like crap the earlier years of his life and now they want to make up for lost time. They never would've guessed that he would be diagnosed with a terminal illness and now they want to compensate *which is dog shit btw*. How dare they put you and your fianc\u00e9 through this. People always forget how fragile life is and they're AH for choosing how they're going to spend ***your fianc\u00e9's*** time.\n\nThis is a honeymoon and you have every right to be upset ***but it's your finance's decision***.\n\n>\u00a0My fianc\u00e9 won\u2019t say anything to them because he doesn\u2019t want to fight with anyone during his final time here (which I understand)!\u00a0\n\nRespectfully...f- that! This man has a limited amount of time and he (both of you but especially him) should be selfish. Put yourselves first. **He has no responsibility to be people pleasing shitty family members in this time of his life**. It's gonna be really shitty if in his final days he realizes that he decided to please some shit smear family members instead of prioritizing himself and the people that were always there for him since the very beginning.\n\nSome options:\n\n1. He should put his foot down *if he feels the same way about the honeymoon*. If his family gets upset about the boundary, it simply means they never gave a fuck about him from the get go and they just wanted to ease their own guilt in which case, if I were you guys, I wouldn't even take the \"honeymoon\" handout. \n\n2. If your fianc\u00e9 *does* want them there then...you might have to suck it up. The dying man gets the final say if he wants his family at his honeymoon (only acceptable in this case due to circumstances)\n\n3. *Or* turn this honeymoon handout into a family get together and make a separate plan for a honeymoon even if it's smaller and not at a destination honeymoon.\n\nSupport your fianc\u00e9 if he needs to put his foot down. If his family acts up, tell them to take their handout and shove it where it fits and take a honeymoon you guys can reasonably afford and enjoy. Focus on his peace and happiness right now. **It's all about what he wants right now.**\n\n  \n\\*\\*Edited for clarity", "NTA.  Cancel the wedding and elope. Spend a few nights at your favorite local hotel/retreat. Then turn the trip to PV into one final family vacation.", "NTA. Ask them if their parents went on their honemoon", "See this trip as a family vacation.\n\nTHEN go on another honeymoon.\n\nNTA\n\nStay strong for each other.", "Yeah, NAH. \n\nDid his parents pick the date of your wedding? Was there any choice presented regarding having his birthday party during the honeymoon?\n\nIf they picked the wedding date, with your wedding scheduled right before his birthday, then maybe they're the AHs. But if you picked the wedding date and knew his birthday was right after that, then you had to imagine his family would want this time with him.\n\nYou also don't discuss timing. Are the parent & siblings there for the entire honeymoon? Are there days that don't overlap? This whole thing could be quite manageable if everybody is willing to be reasonable about it.", "You\u2019re not wrong in thinking this is weird, because it is. They\u2019re hijacking a present they give you, and tag along. So it\u2019s not them giving you a honeymoon anymore, it\u2019s them giving you a family vacation. \n\nYou\u2019re allowed to say this is weird, his family should understand that you and him need and want time together without them. \n\nHowever - what to do. You can choose to call it them crashing your honeymoon, and make sure to tell your friends and family that they\u2019re coming along on your honeymoon and make a little fun of them for that. \nOr, as other sugggest, call this a family vacation and make plans for another honeymoon. Maybe you even can take it before the wedding? \n\nYou are also allowed to tell your husband that you\u2019re disappointed his family is coming along, and that you would\u2019ve preferred to be alone with him.\n\nHowever I also see plenty of fun opportunities to make his family embarrassed if they are imposing on your intimate time ;)", "This is a vacation paid for by them.

Don\u2019t tell the in-laws. And when they find out, and give you shit for it, tell them you guys wanted to have raunchy sex all hours of the day without family next door.", "see if you could swing leaving a few days before everyone else or stay a little longer after they leave.  everyone is allowed to feel there feelings including you.  maybe sit down with them and make a family time agenda.  like Monday lets all go to this place, have lunch and then hubby and I can have a romantic dinner later.  set up family activities  and get togethers as well as along time.   Think of this less as a honeymoon and more of a big adventure .", "NAH.\n\nYou are getting a free trip.  Your options are to 1) Accept or 2) Decline.\n\nThey aren't AH for trying to reconnect with their son. You're not AH for being put off by it. \n\nDo yourself a favor and do something special with your husband the night of the wedding, and consider THAT your honeymoon.\n\nThat will make it easier to enjoy the Puerto Vallarta Birthday Family Trip.", "In other scenarios this would be an issue but he's terminally ill and they're basically wanting to spend time with him before he passes. It's kind of a grey area.\n\nI agree with the others, go on the trip and then have your own personal \"honeymoon\" later. NAH", "This is not a honeymoon, this is a family vacation, don\u2019t deprive yourself and your fianc\u00e9 from the honeymoon experience, book your honeymoon trip, even if it\u2019s just for 4, 5 days, and enjoy yourselves, make it an unforgettable experience.", "NAH, and I think you're actually handling this much better than I would be. I think you should be firm about boundaries as far as getting alone time together (and not just at night when you're sleeping), but stay as gracious as you can about the times the family is with you. \n\nI'm really sorry, OP. This is so sad.", "NAH.", "Nobody is the asshole. The whole situation sucks, and somethings in life are just sad. Best to both of you, and also to his family.", "NAH", "If you can, your own honeymoon before his birthday, even if it\u2019s much simpler. This sounds more like a family vacation. Do this for yourselves. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nNTA", "It is weird that they are going on the honeymoon with you.", "Yes. if possible, go on your own for-real honeymoon first. Then, it's clear this is a family vacation.", "I agree with this whole comment but they\u2019re still AHs for not being clear and upfront. Don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s a honeymoon and then invite yourself alone. They should have said they wanted to pay for a nice holiday one last time and they would come along in their own room, too. Presumably their intentions are to spend time with their son before he passes away, but it was rude to fake out a honeymoon and then be like, just kidding we\u2019ll be there, too.", "He\u2019s terminally ill\u2026 there\u2019s no guarantee of how much time he will have left, particularly how much time outside of a hospital he will have left.  \n\nHe could have the physical ability and stamina for a real family-free honeymoon after this or he could not.  \n\nIf I were OP I\u2019d openly refer to this trip as a \u201cfamily reunion\u201d not a honeymoon and ask her SO what he would like to do for their exclusive honeymoon.", "Yeah, that's what I thought too, treat it like a trip for his birthday, and op and husband can go to another trip for their honeymoon", "That, or tack on a few days before or after the family is there to have some alone time.", "This, I think I would not call this my honeymoon. I think I would call this the family trip. Then plan something for you and your husband to do just the two of you even if it\u2019s just a long weekend in your own city. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this and sending you best wishes.", "BEST ANSWER EVER. \ud83e\udd70", "Perfect solution. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.", "I would say NAH, I'm solid on the NTA camp, but I agree with everything else. Treat this as a nice vacation, and go somewhere else with your husband. Make sure he knows this and is aware of this in advance.", "Agree. They bought a trip, don't make this trip your honeymoon, then. It's a family vacation paid for by his family. You and your husband can take your own trip, even just a weekend getaway to an air bnb, and make that your honeymoon.\n\nI know there are a lot of emotions involved and time is limited, but you're focusing on the wrong things. Just enjoy the time you have together, thank the family for footing the bill for your vacation, and plan a honeymoon with your husband separately. Soon, these things won't matter anymore and you might regret bickering about them, upon reflection.", "That was exactly my reaction as well.\n\nDon't let them hijack your honeymoon - just plan a new one. And DON'T share the details!", "Yup. They could combine their honeymoon with this trip and it'd be ideal for everyone.", "That's what I came to say. \n\nIt's really annoying that the rooms are right next to each other, but it's his birthday, and probably his last birthday, so even though the trip was originally a honeymoon, let him pick if he wants to fight this battle with his parents.  If not, like everyone else is saying, go on another trip (beforehand if possible) and call this one a birthday trip or family vacation.", "Smart question.", "this should be up more", "True. They might be able to squeeze in a honeymoon after, though.", "\\^ absolutely", "I like this idea. Especially given that I'm sure you don't want to cause your fiance additional stress right now, I'd try to mentally shift this in your mind to a family vacation. Maybe within the time that you're there, you can book a couple's massage/romantic dinner for two. Or, maybe you guys decide to come a day or two early (spending your own money) or stay a day or two later so you have that time for yourselves.", "My thoughts exactly. Let this go and have fun for his sake.", "OP says in-laws chose the dates for the trip, not the wedding.  To me that means they want to call it a honeymoon but it's really a family retreat.\n\nSo OP and her husband can have their own honeymoon right after the wedding, and then go on this other vacation with his family.", "Yeah, they just need to do their own honeymoon and enjoy the trip with his family as a birthday celebration. It sounds like this trip is not right after the wedding like a traditional honeymoon, so they can schedule something for just the two of them then.", "I guess what we don\u2019t know is who called it a honeymoon?", "I hear you, but they could even do a short weekend trip somewhere nearby, stay at a fancy hotel, and call that their official honeymoon. It doesn\u2019t need to mean international travel.", "NTA but just refers to it as a family vacation, which is exactly what it is. Instead, name the time you spend away from each other your honeymoon.", "Especially since it has been \"scheduled\" separately from the wedding.  They can do whatever they want on their wedding night and call THAT the honeymoon.", "Yup. Just say you want to stay for a while longer.", "Oh absolutely do so if they can!", "That\u2019s true. OP said they gifted them a honeymoon as a wedding present but maybe it was always intended to be a group vacation. I\u2019m just going off her wording that implies they offered to pay for a honeymoon and then made decisions behind their back. I can even understand them deciding later, we\u2019d like to spend that time with you. But they should have asked, or said \u201ccan we be there for x amount of time with you?\u201d rather than just do it.", "Yeah my prior comment was unclear and didn\u2019t express what I\u2019m thinking. In sum: I think OP is leaning way too hard into what is essentially a label."]}
