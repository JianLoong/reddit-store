We have been together for two years. My fiance was not close with his family growing up at all. In the two years we have been dating I have only met his parents like 3 times.  That doesn\u2019t bother me, like I said, he has a lot of resentment due to his upbringing and just doesn\u2019t particularly like spending much time with them. Nothing bad happened to him on their part but outside of his basic needs being taken care of there was little emotional support. \n\nMy fiance was given a terminal diagnosis a few months ago with a two year life expectancy. Treatments are not an option so we are just living life to the fullest. After he learned of his illness he and his family have gotten a bit closer in that they see each other more often. \n \nHis family (very very wealthy) gifted us our honeymoon as our wedding gift. My husband and I chose puerto Vallarta because we wanted a relaxing resort vacation and to go snorkeling together. One last boujee trip for our bucklist. But - his parents also chose the dates of the honeymoon without asking us. So they chose to book the trip so that his birthday was during it. Then they said they wanted to spend his last birthday with him, so they also will be joining us. They did get their own suite at the resort, and both of his siblings got rooms at the resort too. Dont get me wrong, I am really grateful they are gifting us this experience. But im annoyed they deliberately made it during a time that they could conveniently join our HONEYMOON. I know he is sick, and I know they want to spend time with him. My fiance won\u2019t say anything to them because he doesn\u2019t want to fight with anyone during his final time here (which I understand)! I think I just wish they could have booked a separate trip for the family to go on rather than during our honeymoon, a time that we could have spent together alone- which honestly we get rarely these days. Between hospital visits and seeing friends and checking off things he wants to experience, we are pretty busy! Like I mentioned earlier, money is not an issue and could easily have been made into a separate trip, but they CHOSE to make the trip during his birthday so they had the excuse to join in. When they told us that they were also coming on the trip, I said that was a little strange. Now they are mad at me for not understanding how important it is for them to spend my fiances birthday with him. The entire family thinks that I am wrong for being upset about this. His parents have said I will barely even see them so I shouldn\u2019t be upset. But we are all staying at the same resort, with rooms right next to each other.

Treat it as such. If they\u2019re paying, great. Enjoy it. Then go on your own honeymoon with just your spouse. Overall while it\u2019s a weird situation, I get that they\u2019re desperate to squeeze out every last enjoyable second they can before they lose their child. NAH", "Call it his birthday trip, and book a honeymoon somewhere else either before or after this trip, and pick something you can pay for yourselves.", "I'm sorry to hear of your partner's diagnosis.\n\nThat said, if your partner's family is paying for the trip, you don't really get to dictate the terms of the trip (as with any other gift). Does it suck that they offered a honeymoon trip - which most people would reasonably assume would be the two of you - and then planned to join? Yeah, sure. \n\nMy advice? Enjoy what sounds like a very nice trip, then plan a separate honeymoon. If the timing is important to you and they planned the trip at the time that you and your partner really wanted a solo honeymoon trip, it's fair to ask for the trip to be another time to allow you two to enjoy a honeymoon (that you'd pay for yourselves).\n\nNTA, I get wanting an actual honeymoon trip, but again, doesn't have to be *this* trip - so I wouldn't push that point. Hopefully you can all give each other some grace in a really sad circumstance.", "INFO: What does your fianc\u00e9 want?\n\nIf he wants them there, I\u2019m sorry OP, but the man who is dying gets the final say", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s totally understandable why you are upset. This is your honeymoon and it should be what you & your husband want. \n\nUnfortunately, this is his family\u2019s way of making amends for not being there for him emotionally as he was growing up. They should have asked you and your husband what you wanted. But they aren\u2019t being rational. Grieving often begins before the loss occurs, and can make people make emotional decisions. \n\nIt sounds like your husband really does not want to push the issue. Because of that, and because of the importance of keeping the peace in the time he has left\u2026I\u2019d plan a separate honeymoon with him and not tell any family members. If you\u2019re able to do this prior to the family trip, it may make the trip with them more enjoyable. \n\nI\u2019d also recommend talking with a grief counselor during this process if you\u2019re not already. If his family is trying to make up for lost time, this may not be the last issue that arises. \n\nThoughts are with you OP, this is a very difficult situation.", "NAH. This situation is not the typical honeymoon situation. \n\nI think it's understandable that you're annoyed but it's also understandable that his family would want to make some great memories with him before they lose him.\n\nThe worst thing that could happen would be for your husband to have to witness you and his family fight over him and how distressing that would be for him. Those aren't the kind of memories anyone wants to be making.", "NAH\n\nJust stop calling it your honeymoon and consider it a family trip. Schedule and pay for your own honeymoon with just the two of you. It's ok to be frustrated, but considered it's a massively expensive GIFT from them, I would swallow the frustration and be grateful for the free vacation. Just do something else with just the two of you for your honeymoon.", "Treat this as a last family vacation. Go on a Honeymoon at a later date, just the 2 of you", "NTA however just call it what it really is, a family vacation. Plan something away for just the two of you & call that your honeymoon instead.", "NAH - I get that this is supposed to be your honeymoon and therefore don't want the in laws around. But if I'm reading this right you are getting married around your husband's bday and as such will be gone on his bday, and his parent's want to spend what might be his last bday with him. Could you see about not having rooms right next to each other. Because if that's the case you literally might only see them when at designated meet up times (ex, dinner). Or IDK how much vacation time and disposable money you have or anything like that, but if it's possible maybe use this as a family vacation and then fly from there to your actual honeymoon vacation or even look into staying a few days longer than what the in laws will be there for.", "NTA but given the circumstances I\u2019d follow your husband\u2019s wishes. How about you plan a small weekend getaway separate from this one for just the two of you? It won\u2019t be Puerto Vallarta but you\u2019ll be together and can spend quality time alone and no one needs to know that you consider that your real honeymoon and not the family trip!", "So, his parents chose the dates to book a vacation for his birthday.\nThis isn't your honeymoon. It's a family vacation. \nSince money isn't an issue, I suggest booking an actual honeymoon. \nAll of you only have two years left with this person.", "I'd say NTA. It's a bit weird that they want to come on a honeymoon with you, but given the circumstances, I guess I get it? But still, it's understandable you guys would want some time and space alone. Maybe there would be a way to work out a compromise with them? Seems like everyone here is just trying to make sure they have no regrets once the end comes for your fiancee. Hopefully, there's an answer that works for everyone. \n\nI'm sorry you're in this overall situation, and I hope the best for you, your fiancee, and your guy's family.", "NTA, but just consider this a birthday trip and tell your fiance that you'll be expecting to take a real honeymoon with him during a time that isn't his birthday where it is just the 2 of you. Doesn't have to be expensive. Book a cabin in the woods with a hot tub and enjoy some alone time.", "I won't judge this. Your fianc\u00e9e has a time limit, and a lot of people that he needs to spend time with while he can. I don't know what his diagnosis is, so I don't have any idea how long he will be able to live an active life, but combining events seems prudent at this point. Try to make sure you get some alone time, let his family know that that is important to you, but understand that this is hard for everyone, and let him bask in the people who care about him for as long as he can, and as much as he can. whatever the diagnosis was, I hope he beats it, and you get to live a long and happy life together. But, since it seems unlikely, try to make the most of the time you have, build memories, and build a solid relationship with his family if you can. You will all need each other for comfort in a couple of years.", "NAH\n\nWow! This is a hard one. I would step back from calling this a honeymoon and maybe treat it more as a family vacation (or celebration). The very last thing your fianc\u00e9 needs or wants is to be a cause of familial tension in his final months.\n\nYou mention his family is quite wealthy. Perhaps you could talk with them and your fianc\u00e9 (and his doctors) about what\u2019s going to happen over the next year or so and plan several bucket list adventures or activities for him - some with just the two of you and they may join in others. This could include visits to childhood haunts or long lost friends.\n\nTake his health into consideration so perhaps a bit more active early on and maybe more cruises later. View it as a celebration of his life - not a farewell tour. And continually reevaluate the plans to make sure it\u2019s all positive rather than overwhelming. Just being there for him is what\u2019s important - not where you go.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re struggling through this. I certainly wish you the very best of luck and as much quality time with your fianc\u00e9 as possible.\n\nI lost my sister last summer - she had been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer ~1 year prognosis. We planned multiple outings with her - especially with her niece, but they never really came to fruition as the end came so much faster than anyone thought. While I wish we\u2019d had more time, I was deeply touched and honored to help her through her struggles too. Even more meaningful than the trips would\u2019ve been. Truly cherish and celebrate the time you have left together now - especially the quality time.", ">just wish they could have booked a separate trip for the family to go on rather than during our honeymoon,\n\nUnderstandable, completely understandable.  Yet, it seems like they are thinking this will be his (and their) last opportunity to spend his birthday with him. It's not ideal, but I suggest you speak to your in-laws and discuss giving you and your new spouse time **alone** together. Maybe you can spend the day together and have dinner at night with them or vice versa.", "Just take your own honeymoon. Keep this trip as a family trip and plan your own honeymoon. Don\u2019t tell them about it til you\u2019re back.", "I think that if this is a recognized bucket list thing: if your husband didn't want them there he'd be adamant that they not come. They've grown closer by your own admission and their time together is something he's valued enough to make a reality. Please don't put him in the position to force him to make a zero sum choice here based on your own feelings if you want to help him make the most of his time here.\n\nYou're NTA for your emotions at all and I'm sorry yall are having to navigate these tough waters together.", "NTA. They do not get to make his decisions for him and should have checked with both of you first. I understand wanting to spend the time with him, but it needs to be run by him first. It sounds like he agrees with you on this point. Maybe you can make a request with the staff to be on a different floor from them for a little more separation, and plan for some activities outside the resort with just your husband.", "NTA. But call the resort and ask for another room.", "NTA, it's weird. So you know what I'd do? Take this as a free holiday and book your own separate honeymoon, another time. Don't tell them in case they try to crash it again. \n\nReally sorry for the position you're in, enjoy the time you have left together.", "NTA its super weird they want to go on his honeymoon. I would just treat it as a regular vacation and go on a separate honeymoon.\n\nOne question though. They said its okay because you will hardly see them, if they will hardly be seen what is the point of them going on the honeymoon with you?", "NAH\n\nGiven the situation and what his time being active is very short I get family wanting being close during happy times\n\nIt\u2019s a vacation, enjoy time with him.", "**NTA**\n\nHis family probably feels guilty for treating him like crap the earlier years of his life and now they want to make up for lost time. They never would've guessed that he would be diagnosed with a terminal illness and now they want to compensate *which is dog shit btw*. How dare they put you and your fianc\u00e9 through this. People always forget how fragile life is and they're AH for choosing how they're going to spend ***your fianc\u00e9's*** time.\n\nThis is a honeymoon and you have every right to be upset ***but it's your finance's decision***.\n\n>\u00a0My fianc\u00e9 won\u2019t say anything to them because he doesn\u2019t want to fight with anyone during his final time here (which I understand)!\u00a0\n\nRespectfully...f- that! This man has a limited amount of time and he (both of you but especially him) should be selfish. Put yourselves first. **He has no responsibility to be people pleasing shitty family members in this time of his life**. It's gonna be really shitty if in his final days he realizes that he decided to please some shit smear family members instead of prioritizing himself and the people that were always there for him since the very beginning.\n\nSome options:\n\n1. He should put his foot down *if he feels the same way about the honeymoon*. If his family gets upset about the boundary, it simply means they never gave a fuck about him from the get go and they just wanted to ease their own guilt in which case, if I were you guys, I wouldn't even take the \"honeymoon\" handout. \n\n2. If your fianc\u00e9 *does* want them there then...you might have to suck it up. The dying man gets the final say if he wants his family at his honeymoon (only acceptable in this case due to circumstances)\n\n3. *Or* turn this honeymoon handout into a family get together and make a separate plan for a honeymoon even if it's smaller and not at a destination honeymoon.\n\nSupport your fianc\u00e9 if he needs to put his foot down. If his family acts up, tell them to take their handout and shove it where it fits and take a honeymoon you guys can reasonably afford and enjoy. Focus on his peace and happiness right now. **It's all about what he wants right now.**\n\n  \n\\*\\*Edited for clarity", "NTA.  Cancel the wedding and elope. Spend a few nights at your favorite local hotel/retreat. Then turn the trip to PV into one final family vacation.", "NTA. Ask them if their parents went on their honemoon", "See this trip as a family vacation.\n\nTHEN go on another honeymoon.\n\nNTA\n\nStay strong for each other.", "Yeah, NAH. \n\nDid his parents pick the date of your wedding? Was there any choice presented regarding having his birthday party during the honeymoon?\n\nIf they picked the wedding date, with your wedding scheduled right before his birthday, then maybe they're the AHs. But if you picked the wedding date and knew his birthday was right after that, then you had to imagine his family would want this time with him.\n\nYou also don't discuss timing. Are the parent & siblings there for the entire honeymoon? Are there days that don't overlap? This whole thing could be quite manageable if everybody is willing to be reasonable about it.", "You\u2019re not wrong in thinking this is weird, because it is. They\u2019re hijacking a present they give you, and tag along. So it\u2019s not them giving you a honeymoon anymore, it\u2019s them giving you a family vacation. \n\nYou\u2019re allowed to say this is weird, his family should understand that you and him need and want time together without them. \n\nHowever - what to do. You can choose to call it them crashing your honeymoon, and make sure to tell your friends and family that they\u2019re coming along on your honeymoon and make a little fun of them for that. \nOr, as other sugggest, call this a family vacation and make plans for another honeymoon. Maybe you even can take it before the wedding? \n\nYou are also allowed to tell your husband that you\u2019re disappointed his family is coming along, and that you would\u2019ve preferred to be alone with him.\n\nHowever I also see plenty of fun opportunities to make his family embarrassed if they are imposing on your intimate time ;)", "This is a vacation paid for by them.

Unfortunately, they aren't any better at communicating now than they were when your fiance was a kid. They only know how to throw money at the problem. Being present makes them relevant and allows them to control the uncontrollable. They are suffering, yes. Death is hard on everyone. \n\nI'm going to run counter to the herd here, as someone who unexpectedly lost a beloved in a tragic way: every day is miraculous. Birthdays aren't any more precious in retrospect than an ordinary Tuesday when there's laughter and love present. A contrived, stressful holiday isn't gifting anyone anything. It IS weird that your in laws chose this timing and it IS weird that they don't expect you to have strange feelings about it. Talk to your fiance. I understand that his days are limited, but you know -- everyone's days are limited. Most of us just don't know it. It's unreasonable for him to expect to keep peace with his controlling parents for the next two years. As his physical strength wanes, what makes either of you think they are going to settle for just ruining your honeymoon? They are setting themselves up to take over his entire death. It belongs to him. It's his death and there is a reason he kept these folks at a distance for as long as he has. Dying doesn't change people at any fundamental level. \n\nIt IS understandable that they want to spend time with him before he dies. It IS understandable that you want to have a chance to be a married couple. You all have competing needs and only one of you has the power to draw boundaries, and that's your fiance. Discuss this over with him. Don't be afraid to bring this to him. After he dies, you are going to be left dealing with them and if you aren't on the same page now, you have no idea how awkward and weird things can get. Ask your fiance what he wants, and brainstorm together how you want to proceed. Gifts with strings aren't gifts. Fake peace isn't peace. It IS okay to just go along with this for now and see how it goes. I'm not saying to create a lot of drama over this. But neither of you need to be afraid of setting proper and appropriate boundaries. Who wants to spend their remaining days tiptoeing around the issues that plagued their entire life? \n\nI'm torn because I don't think you're doing anything wrong here, but neither are his parents. Well, they are creepy and weird, but if your fiance isn't willing to call them out on it, then they are within their rights to do whatever they want to with their money and their so called gifts.

It doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s even close to the wedding. Yes, it\u2019s shitty that they offered to pay for your honeymoon and didn\u2019t follow through, but that\u2019s what you should be mad about. Book another honeymoon.", "Everyone is saying to book a second trip but perhaps something that would make more logistical sense would be for you two to book a couple extra nights at the same resort that you pay for BEFORE (or stay longer after, but y'all might be worn out by then) his family joins? That way you get a little time just the two of you in the location you wanted for your honeymoon.", "This sucks but I think you need to treat this like a bday trip AND do your best to make a honeymoon separately. Pick the date that works for YOU TWO and go. You aren\u2019t out the money because they\u2019re paying for the other trip. I get he\u2019s sick and there\u2019s lots to be done, but if it\u2019s also important to him, you can make it work even if it\u2019s just a weekend at a cabin or a beach hotel.", "Honestly, YTA. Your fianc\u00e9 has limited time left on this earth and his family was a part of his life long before you were. Two years life expectancy can change instantly to months or weeks. It\u2019s not like you can bring this up ten years from now to him about how your honeymoon was ruined forever because his parents were there. Just make the most of whatever time he has left, even if your in laws are involved.", "Get a couples massage and charge it to the room.", "NAH\n\nBut....\n\nLet his family spend his birthday with them.

Ew!", "NTA but why are you stuck on this being your honeymoon, just the two of you? Consider it a free family trip instead; if not and you own up that this isn\u2019t a free lunch and you decide you want to go through with it and cannot save up for a different honeymoon, just the two of you, and they insist on being right next door make sure they can hear you making the most of your honeymoon through the walls.", "Not nearly in the same ball park as what you are dealing with, but .... my niece is married toa marine, he just got back from a 6 month deployment about 2 months ago. They live with her parents (my sister and BIL). They have already gone to hawaii for their honeymoon 2 years ago, and they plan to go again in January 2024.  My sister thought it would be fun to plan a trip for her and her husband at the same time!! \n\nMy Niece, bless her heart, said, \"No. I am not telling you when we are going or where we are staying. This is our vacation together, not a family vacation.\"\n\nThey go camping with the family about once a month, they live with them, there is no reason to travel to far off places with them.", "NTA. Maybe you and your fianc\u00e9e can go on a smaller more intimate honeymoon prior to when this trip is and then just treat this as a birthday vacation for fianc\u00e9e. It is annoying that they hijacked what was supposed to be a romantic getaway and made it on his birthday and a family trip, it would\u2019ve been better as two separate trips so you can still make it that way!

If this wasn\u2019t a terminal illness situation, I\u2019d tell them to bug off. But, here we are\u2026. Make the best of it. Set boundaries and enjoy your time.

Remember, their gift is all about them, not him.", "First, no, NTA. No one wants a family trip as a honeymoon. Family trips are really stressful even when you are close. \n\nI\u2019m assuming his terminal illness won\u2019t do well with stress. So talk to fianc\u00e9 about how he feels about this. Come up with a strategy so that he can signal you that he\u2019s stressed (e.g., scratches his right elbow) so that you can pipe in with \u201coh, we gotta get to that scuba lesson\u201d or (yawn) \u201cI\u2019m beat. We need to get back to honeymooning in our room now\u201d (big smile & wink).\n\nAlso, a list of activities offered at or nearby the resort and sign up for one every day for the two of you so you have a reason to go off on your own.", "Pay yourself for another honeymoon and tray this like another vacation.

Even if it\u2019s a low key hotel with a pool where you can relax and order room service maybe get a couples massage that kind of thing? \n\nI dunno why they presented this as a honeymoon when it\u2019s clearly a family vacation.", "NTA\n\n  \nWhat do you mean \"being upset\"--- That's not as sufficient reaction.\n\n  \nCANCEL The honeymoon. Make a HARD RULE: Either they don't go, or you won't go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\", so they also will be joining us.\" .. Tell your partner. IF he allows this, you will cancel the wedding. THen do just that. YOur future husband is an AH for not making it a hard NO the instant he heard it.", "I think we're missing the point.  I would want my own honeymoon with just so, changing the name of the trip is a bullsh*t way of saying they don't care and don't respect either of you.\n\nI don't think you're the ah.", "Fantastic answer. You\u2019re definitely NTA, but like the IronChef noted, OP, time is running out. Go on your own honeymoon. There is no one dictating how you spend your last moments.", "Yes. Do a separate honeymoon and just think of this as a birthday vacation. It was douchey of them to do this without even discussing it with you. But I would suggest just working around it. NTA", "Yeah. I think NTA, because I think it is an AH move to invade a honeymoon, whatever, but just book a luxury time away as soon as you\u2019re back and make that your honey moon.", "Agreed. Can also ask the resort to move your room and/or upgrade to a honeymoon suite. Definitely NTA. I wouldn't want inlaws or even my immediate family to join me on my honeymoon, let alone do honeymoon activities with family next door.", "They should elope, go on their own romantic honeymoon together, and then have this family reunion trip later.", "She\u2019s had him to herself for years. They want to reconnect during his final days. Follow his lead. He doesn\u2019t want to upset them. OP needs to do the same. These are HIS end of life wishes.", "I fully agree. I think in this case, they\u2019re not trying to be pushy, overbearing in laws, they\u2019re just trying to make memories with their son in his final moments. It\u2019s also their last birthday with him. I would even recommend they invite close family and friends and make it a big celebration of his life and your love. Ask if they\u2019re comfortable with you two staying behind/going early for a few days just the two of you, or book your own honeymoon. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for what you\u2019re all going through. Wishing you many memorable moments together.", "This is a great suggestion. NAH because everyone wants to spend the precious little time with the fianc\u00e9 so OP\u2019s just gotta play the hand they are dealt. View this as a paid-for vacation with the in-laws and then take the honeymoon later. Win / Win", "Then he has to admit he doesn't really want a honeymoon. Dying people can still be assholes and marriage is a partnership. It is fine if he wants to take a family vacation, but pretending that trip also functions as a honeymoon, which it very clearly does not for his partner, is disrespectful to OP.", "I wonder if it would be possible for OP and the fiance to extend the trip a day or two on either end of the current booking to get some proper time to themselves. Covering a couple days at the hotel wouldn't be too bad and they can get some of the experience they were looking forward to.", "CONSENT. His family didn't say, \"we want to go in vacation with you.\" They presented it as a honeymoon...a gift for the couple... and then backhandedly invited themselves. If they had asked in advance, it would be different.", "The parents chose the dates for the \"honeymoon\" trip and placed it on the birthday without OP of the fianc\u00e9's input so that argumenta runs into the fact that it is a manipulative issue of their own creation.", "100%", "Oh yeah NTA.", "Maybe they are, and maybe they aren't.\n\nOP can spend what's left of his life stewing about this, or she can say 'thank you for the completely subsidized trip,' recognize that they're going to miss him when he dies, too, and work to make his remaining days as full of joy and life as possible.", "Idk maybe it was a genuine mistake on their part. They had the idea to gift the honeymoon, presented it, and then got FOMO thinking about everything. It\u2019s a tough situation. Parents could\u2019ve handled it better than co-opting their gift as a family vacation, but I still think it\u2019s very generous.", "Y'all are assuming that OP can take that much more time off work. And that they can afford to pay for second trip. These things are not clear from the post.", "Change your reservations and go a week earlier for yourselves, then meet up or vice versa", "This is the part everyone's forgetting... the parents booked next door! To a couple on their supposed honeymoon! Of course that's weird and rude.", "Respectfully, this is an absolutely awful idea. From everything that his parents will be losing, you suggest they take away the wedding too?", "That last sentence is the one. \n\nKEEP IT TO YOURSELVES!\n\nYou get two exotic trips now. Yay!", "OP should call the resort and explain the situation. Ask for a room on the other side of the resort so at least they aren\u2019t right on top of each other. Any front desk agent who heard that story would probably be happy to be accommodating and move them away from family. Could even call it a complimentary honeymoon upgrade!", " The whole thing seriously sucks and frankly, I'd be inclined to say NAH right now. The parents clearly carry some serious regret over the past and are trying to make up for lost time while they still can. The dying man clearly doesn't want to waste what precious little time he has fighting with the folks he loves. OP clearly wants to maximize their time alone while she still can. None of those motives are selfish.\n\nIf he wants the chance to have a last birthday with his family, however, I'd be inclined to acquiesce to his wishes whether they were fully in line with mine or not (within reason of course). It may not be the romantic snorkeling getaway OP was hoping for, but they can always reframe this as a family vacation and go on another trip privately before or after as others have suggested", "It's not a fucking honeymoon, its a family vacation. At it sounds like that would be ideal for the rest of the family, definitely not OP, and potentially note their fianc\u00e9.", "If he doesn't want to argue about it, that should be the beginning and end of it for OP though.", "I guess all I'm saying is: if OP & partner chose the wedding date knowing that his birthday was immediately after, then they understood there might be some competition for time slots. \n\nSo, it sounds like they're all in a big rush to fit their activities in -- for obvious reasons -- and nobody is really trying to be an AH here and screw with OP's travel plans.", "Call it a birthday trip, arrange a honeymoon somewhere else before or after, and choose an affordable option for the two of you.", "[removed]", "My honeymoon was a weekend a fairly short drive away. It was still awesome \ud83e\udd29", "This.", "You think OPs fiancee wants his parents on his honeymoon?", "Good point. As you said in your reply, OP is definitely putting too much stock in the \"honeymoon\" label. It seems like her fiance's parents gifted them a family vacation that OP mistakenly thought was a honeymoon. I definitely feel for her in this situation, but she really should just be grateful to be able to go on a nice trip in the time she has left with her soon-to-be husband. If she wants a real honeymoon, they need to make additional plans immediately on their own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>His parents have said I will barely even see them so I shouldn\u2019t be upset.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat statement makes it seem like her fiance's parents are planning on giving them time to themselves. I get that every second is precious given how little time they may have left together, but those seconds are just as precious to his parents. If he only gets to go on one more vacation in his life, I'm sure he'd want it to be with his entire family. I'd never call OP an asshole for wanting the experience just to be with him, but things don't always work out like you want them to.", "One night only for their honeymoon? No", "They had no problem taking away his honeymoon from the couple. \n\nThey need to move up the wedding and have their honeymoon sooner. With a terminal diagnosis, getting married as soon as possible would be best. \n\nHe had to be terminally ill for his family to want to be part of his life. When they did, they not only ruined his honeymoon, but attacked his bride for being upset about it. \n\nSo much unnecessary, stressful, selfish drama by his family. \n\nOP wants to honeymoon with her husband. \n\nHis family should be treating every day like it\u2019s his last. \n\nInstead, their parting gift is ruining a honeymoon and attacking his bride. \n\nIf they won\u2019t behave, then the couple should elope. If they stop the harassment, then the couple could just move the wedding up and invite them.", "That's exactly how I felt too.\n\nPlan a new honeymoon instead of letting them ruin your current one. And DO NOT divulge the specifics!", "Sure, but I also understand wanting to spend my child's last birthday on earth with them and maybe not acting totally considerately to their new spouse as a result.", "My wife and I got married in a tiny ceremony on a Tuesday, went to a theme park for three days, and then had our reception on Saturday. It was great.", "Didn\u2019t she say that they have rooms booked right beside their room?

If\n\nYeah, and they have wasted how many seconds in his life up until now. Where was the emotional support during his childhood and the rest of his life.", "I really like this suggestion. It is the only one that makes sense. The only other option is go on the fake honeymoon and take every opportunity to flash the in-laws every time you see them. Let them look forward to seeing you.  What they don\u2019t realize is that you, as his wife, are likely going to be the information line to his medical condition. Ensuring your happiness is in their best interest.", "Yes, that's what OP says. Without any other info though, I'm going to take the parents on their word and assume they will try to give OP and her husband some alone time. It obviously won't be the same as a real honeymoon, but I don't really think you can say his parents  are assholes for wanting to take one last trip with their dying son. If the parents are paying and see this as more of a last birthday celebration, it's their choice. As I said, OP should just try to figure out a separate thing if she wants an actual honeymoon. The entire situation sucks, but I don't think you can blame any party involved for their feelings or actions."]}
