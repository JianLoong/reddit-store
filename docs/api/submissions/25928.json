{"id": 25928, "submission_id": "166b9mo", "title": "AITA for buying my biological daughter a car but not my step-daughter?", "selftext": "Before my daughter \u201cChristina\u201d (currently 19F) started high school, I made her a deal that if she kept above a 3.9 GPA for her freshman through junior year, I would buy her a car for up to $20,000 to have her senior year (on condition that if her GPA dipped below a 3.9 I would take it away). She kept a 4.0 throughout high school, so I let her pick out a car before senior year. During her sophomore year, I met my now wife \u201cJenny\u201d (now 40F) and her daughter \u201cEmily\u201d (17F). Emily started her senior year a couple weeks ago, and a few days ago she texted me asking when I was going to take her to look at cars. This took me by surprise, as I didn\u2019t realize she expected a car. She has a 2.7 GPA and spends more time curating her Instagram than doing her homework. I explained to her that Christina received her car as a reward for good grades, not as a given. I later felt bad because I guess I didn\u2019t give her the same incentive that I gave Christina, and I told her that if she could get a 3.9 GPA with her senior year grades AND get into an accredited college or university, I would let her pick out a car upon graduation.\n\nI thought this was a fair deal, or even UNFAIR towards Christina since I made HER keep a 3.9 for all FOUR years of high school, but Jenny pulled me aside after Emily went to school and told me I was being unfair since Emily had different circumstances than Christina. For background, Jenny\u2019s ex husband\u2013and Emily\u2019s bio dad\u2013was a very wealthy man who spoiled the crap out of her. Everything she wanted, all she had to do was ask for, for the first 12 years of her life. She didn\u2019t try in school because her dad promised he would get her into any college she wanted, and give her a job at his company afterwards. Then, when Emily was 12, her dad was arrested for serious tax fraud. Essentially, he is in prison now, and Jenny has some money of her own but nothing compared to the life of luxury they were both used to. I think Emily is very hurt by what happened, and she also hasn\u2019t had the chance to develop a work ethic.\n\nI told Jenny that I think my only wrongdoing was not helping Emily develop a work ethic sooner, and that my hope is that she rises to the occasion, cleans up her act, and gets the car. I also said I would do everything I could to help Emily research colleges and perfect her application, but Jenny wasn\u2019t having it. She and Emily have both been giving me the cold shoulder the past couple of days and still think I\u2019m treating Emily unfairly. I really don\u2019t know what to do. I want to give Emily a goal that is challenging but attainable, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to put a strain on my relationship with my family.  \n\n\n    \n\nEdit: Formatting\n\nEdit 2: more formatting issues", "created_utc": 1693488684, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166b9mo/aita_for_buying_my_biological_daughter_a_car_but/", "score": 7912, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No. Full stop. \n\nI'd keep the offer on the table as a take-it-or-leave-it.

It\u2019s Jenny\u2019s responsibility to provide a car for her daughter.\n\nEmily\u2019s circumstances have nothing to do with it.  That is not your mess to fix.

Your wife is wrong, and she is well on her way to having an entitled lay about who can't be bothered to care for herself if she doesn't seen sense.

You're a great dad based on this and Jen giving you the cold shoulder is a total red flag. I guess bio dad being in prison meant they were out as fast as his money was taken from fraud.\n\nYour bio daughter maintained her grades and she is better for it. Why wouldn't the same apply to Emily? They're both being unreasonable here. If Jen wants her kid to have a car just because, then she should buy it. If Emily picks up the slack on her grades and gets into college a car is a great reward for doing your best. \n\nWhy would Jen want to put a wedge between you and your bio daughter by changing the rules all of a sudden, because that's what will happen, resentment that will fester?

Hell, bio daughter still has a right to be resentful even if step daughter takes this deal because she still would be doing half the work for the same reward. \n\nMy only suggestion would be to offer some other compromises that may be slightly more realistic for step-daughter to achieve.

You say you don\u2019t want to place a strain on your family life, but about your relationship with your bio-daughter? This is the type of thing that could cause massive resentment and anger (towards both you and step-daughter) that will fester for a long time if you don\u2019t handle it fairly.

Do we want to teach her to do her best? Or do we want to teach her that even if she tries her very best it's unlikely not gonna be good enough to succeed because it's already too late?\n\nI know this is not gonna be a popular opinion cause it's gonna read as a participation trophy. But to a certain extent both girls have a completely set of circumstances. One has been encouraged and expected to do well at school all her life. The other has been left to her own devices and clearly not been encouraged to work hard at school.\n\nAlso let's keep in mind that Christina was told about this deal well in advance. While Emily was not.\n\nI think considering the circumstances it would be fair to amend the rules to acknowledge that Emily is starting from a different place and that she has YEARS to catch up on. A lot of subjects like maths build upon themselves and just studying hard for your next test isn't gonna cut it. On top of that learning/studying is an actual skill that takes time to develop. There are tons of stories of smart kids who were never encouraged to study. Then got absolutely buried by the school system because they never learned to study and their parents always left them to their own devices.\n\nI think what would be best for Emily is to set smaller achievable goals and actually HELP her reach those goals. Help her with setting up a study schedule, talk about subjects she struggles with and see if there are any she may need tutoring for, help her look up tricks for memorising information, summarising and other study tips.\n\nIf she consistently reaches the goals, sticks to the schedule and her grades are in an upward trajectory I think it's fine to reward her for that. You can teach her that doing her best reaps rewards.\n\nI know it's tempting, especially here on reddit, for us to sub-consciously want to 'punish' someone who has been very privileged and has not done their best until now. But you need to rethink what you REALLY want. Do you want to keep things absolutely fair? Or do you want to teach Emily to work hard and for her to reach academic success?\n\nWe've all had obstacles put in front of us that seem so unattainable that it just seems too daunting to start. Especially when you are young it can make a world of difference to have someone on your team. Not just someone who sets the goal and expects you to figure it out. But who is actually there in the trenches with you and tries to get you over that initial hurdle, which is finding the courage to get started.\n\nSchoolwork is HARD, being young hard, changing your whole lifestyle (because that is basically what it is to go from barely any studying to studying several hours a day, every day) is hard, believing you can do things you've never been capable of before is hard. Real parenting can absolutely be 'let them figure it out the hard way'. But I think it's clear that Emily has never had someone actually take interest in her schoolwork before. So, imo, I think actually sitting down with her and trying to figure it out WITH her is actually the biggest sign that you actually believe she CAN do it. Which in turn may be the biggest chance you will ever get to have her believe the same and want the same for herself.\n\nThis could be the moment that decides the rest of her life. Whether she'll ever actually try her hardest for anything or not. Why not try everything within your power? Even if that may end up being in vain in the end. At least you can say you tried. And she'll always remember that too. I don't think setting a goal and leaving her too it is all you can do. And just because it was enough for Christina doesn't mean Emily is gonna be the same.\n\nAs far as Christina is concerned I would be honest with her. I would explain to her that your goal is to encourage Emily to study. That the goal you set for Christina seemed an achievable goal for her at the time due to her educational history but that you don't think the same would be achievable for Emily at that time. So that you have set different benchmarks for Emily so that she can prove she wants it, so she can learn how to study and do her best and show her improvement gradually as she gets used to studying. It can also be mentioned that Christina was made aware of this deal while Emily was never informed/offered the same.\n\nIf you are raising Christina to be empathetic and caring person she will hopefully care more about Emily's future happiness and supporting her in this daunting task than the fact that she herself had a different goalpost.\n\nWhat may also help is making the price different.\n\nFor example if Christina got a car up to 20k for a 3.9 then maybe a smaller goal can be set up for Emily. For example a lower budget car but ONLY if she reaches all the goals that were set out for her.\n\nThis way you can both encourage Emily by giving her achievable goals and rewarding her for her hard work (and yes raising your grades suddenly after decades of slacking academically IS hard work) while also acknowledging that Christina also worked hard consistently and therefor got the bigger reward.", "He already did that and make if for only her senior year grades.", "It's absolutely not. If you seriously think 20 grand is \"veryyy low\" for a used car for a 17 year old then I envy your upbringing. \n\nThere are many, many, safe, reliable vehicles for a quarter that price.

Also, Mom has some responsibility here.", "But it doesn\u2019t sound like OP ever talked to Emily saying something like \u201cit\u2019s great that I am now your step-Dad. What I offer is that if you work hard and get X grades, then I will buy you a car\u201d. Instead, he has let time pass until the SD has failed and then told her that it is too late. This sort of thing is really important when blending teenage families. Emily has suffered from poor parenting in the past (particularly the Dad), and it\u2019s also important that he helps her grow as a person, rather than punishing her for her bio Dad\u2019s actions.", "Damn right.

Because he didn't want his wife to know how much trouble he was in he borrowed money from some questionable sources. And his situation only got worse.\n\nSo they made him a deal. They set him up in a new practice office in a somewhat shady city neighborhood, 30 minutes away from the nice suburb where he practiced legitimately. They bused in \"patients\" to his office and he prescribed them Oxycontin and other Schedule 2 drugs.\n\nEventually his pill mill was busted. And he will be in prison for the rest of his life and all of his assets were sold. His name was dragged through the mud in the newspapers. It was reported as if it was an independent operation. \n\nHe wouldn't rat out the people who set him up in business because they would've killed his wife and kids who he loves.\n\nHis kids were now adults who were already able to take care of themselves. His wife was eligible for Social Security and with her kids' help now lives in a senior development.\n\nWife and kids swear they didn't have any idea.", "I agree with this.  I could get straight A's with minimal effort whereas my sister would have to struggle and expend 10x the effort and never be able to get straight A's.  I think there i a better middle ground.  Or, if he wants her to have a work ethic, give her the other option of getting a job and he will put an equal match of money for a car as she does.", "But it's also the difference in Christina getting to make 4 years of mistakes and recover from them incrementally/have the buffer of knowing one bad class isn't gonna fuck her, while Emily only has one chance to pull her GPA up a whole point. If you balance the time vs effort it's not as unfair as it looks. It's easier to keep a good GPA than raise a shitty one. If she's not in any weighted upper level classes like AP or college prep then it might not matter anyway, because she doesn't have enough to pull herself up that much.", "True. But he\u2019s also only been her stepfather for less than two years (said he met her mom when she was a sophomore and she\u2019s about to start senior year). \n\nMaybe instead of 1/4 of the amount then 1/3?", "I kind of do see OP as the ah here to an extent because he could have clued the stepdaughter into the deal. But for some reason it wasn't even on his radar. I get that Blended families are difficult sometimes. But it does seem like the stepdaughter was a complete afterthought. So I see the offer of a car at a 3.9 average as kind of a slap in the face when he didn't even make an effort to encourage her to improve her grades over the past couple years. While he's right that it wouldn't be fair to his daughter to just give his stepdaughter a car, it's not really fair for him to set the expectations so high when he never had any expectations for her in the first place.\n\nI definitely would consider a compromise of a lower price car with a grade point average that is actually achievable by the kid if they work hard. Going from a 2.7 grade point average to 3.9 the final year? That's going to be almost unachievable by most kids.", "I agree, but depending on the laws of their area, 17 might still be too young (for Emily) to legally work.
