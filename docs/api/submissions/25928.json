{"id": 25928, "submission_id": "166b9mo", "title": "AITA for buying my biological daughter a car but not my step-daughter?", "selftext": "Before my daughter \u201cChristina\u201d (currently 19F) started high school, I made her a deal that if she kept above a 3.9 GPA for her freshman through junior year, I would buy her a car for up to $20,000 to have her senior year (on condition that if her GPA dipped below a 3.9 I would take it away). She kept a 4.0 throughout high school, so I let her pick out a car before senior year. During her sophomore year, I met my now wife \u201cJenny\u201d (now 40F) and her daughter \u201cEmily\u201d (17F). Emily started her senior year a couple weeks ago, and a few days ago she texted me asking when I was going to take her to look at cars. This took me by surprise, as I didn\u2019t realize she expected a car. She has a 2.7 GPA and spends more time curating her Instagram than doing her homework. I explained to her that Christina received her car as a reward for good grades, not as a given. I later felt bad because I guess I didn\u2019t give her the same incentive that I gave Christina, and I told her that if she could get a 3.9 GPA with her senior year grades AND get into an accredited college or university, I would let her pick out a car upon graduation.\n\nI thought this was a fair deal, or even UNFAIR towards Christina since I made HER keep a 3.9 for all FOUR years of high school, but Jenny pulled me aside after Emily went to school and told me I was being unfair since Emily had different circumstances than Christina. For background, Jenny\u2019s ex husband\u2013and Emily\u2019s bio dad\u2013was a very wealthy man who spoiled the crap out of her. Everything she wanted, all she had to do was ask for, for the first 12 years of her life. She didn\u2019t try in school because her dad promised he would get her into any college she wanted, and give her a job at his company afterwards. Then, when Emily was 12, her dad was arrested for serious tax fraud. Essentially, he is in prison now, and Jenny has some money of her own but nothing compared to the life of luxury they were both used to. I think Emily is very hurt by what happened, and she also hasn\u2019t had the chance to develop a work ethic.\n\nI told Jenny that I think my only wrongdoing was not helping Emily develop a work ethic sooner, and that my hope is that she rises to the occasion, cleans up her act, and gets the car. I also said I would do everything I could to help Emily research colleges and perfect her application, but Jenny wasn\u2019t having it. She and Emily have both been giving me the cold shoulder the past couple of days and still think I\u2019m treating Emily unfairly. I really don\u2019t know what to do. I want to give Emily a goal that is challenging but attainable, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to put a strain on my relationship with my family.  \n\n\n    \n\nEdit: Formatting\n\nEdit 2: more formatting issues", "created_utc": 1693488684, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166b9mo/aita_for_buying_my_biological_daughter_a_car_but/", "score": 229, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No. Full stop. \n\nI'd keep the offer on the table as a take-it-or-leave-it.

It\u2019s Jenny\u2019s responsibility to provide a car for her daughter.\n\nEmily\u2019s circumstances have nothing to do with it.  That is not your mess to fix.

You're not giving your daughter a car BECAUSE she's your biological child, she EARNED it. You gave stepdaughter the same opportunity(an even better one, actually-shorter time frame) and she turns her nose up at it. Your wife is wrong, and she is well on her way to having an entitled lay about who can't be bothered to care for herself if she doesn't seen sense.

Her being spoiled prior to your arrival in her life has absolutely nothing to do with you.

You're a great dad based on this and Jen giving you the cold shoulder is a total red flag. I guess bio dad being in prison meant they were out as fast as his money was taken from fraud.\n\nYour bio daughter maintained her grades and she is better for it. Why wouldn't the same apply to Emily? They're both being unreasonable here. If Jen wants her kid to have a car just because, then she should buy it. If Emily picks up the slack on her grades and gets into college a car is a great reward for doing your best. \n\nWhy would Jen want to put a wedge between you and your bio daughter by changing the rules all of a sudden, because that's what will happen, resentment that will fester?

The deal you offered was extremely generous, especially since your bio daughter had to work hard for WAY longer to get the same reward. If I was bio daughter I would be *extremely* resentful if my parent bought a step-sibling a car without having to do any of the work I had to. Hell, bio daughter still has a right to be resentful even if step daughter takes this deal because she still would be doing half the work for the same reward. \n\nMy only suggestion would be to offer some other compromises that may be slightly more realistic for step-daughter to achieve. For example, instead of expecting her to get a 3.9, tell her she needs to get a part time job and save up X amount which you will match at the end of the year. Or say you\u2019ll give her a 10k car if she can get her GPA to a 3.5, and any car over 10k she wants either her or her mom needs to make up the difference. \n\nRegardless of what compromise you choose, one thing that is clear is that is *extremely* unfair to your bio-daughter and teaches step-daughter no valuable lesson to just hand her a car for nothing. You say you don\u2019t want to place a strain on your family life, but about your relationship with your bio-daughter? This is the type of thing that could cause massive resentment and anger (towards both you and step-daughter) that will fester for a long time if you don\u2019t handle it fairly.

She should be trying to work out a solution privately with you and then you should be presenting it to step-daughter as a united front.
