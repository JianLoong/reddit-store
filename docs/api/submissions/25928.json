{"id": 25928, "submission_id": "166b9mo", "title": "AITA for buying my biological daughter a car but not my step-daughter?", "selftext": "Before my daughter \u201cChristina\u201d (currently 19F) started high school, I made her a deal that if she kept above a 3.9 GPA for her freshman through junior year, I would buy her a car for up to $20,000 to have her senior year (on condition that if her GPA dipped below a 3.9 I would take it away). She kept a 4.0 throughout high school, so I let her pick out a car before senior year. During her sophomore year, I met my now wife \u201cJenny\u201d (now 40F) and her daughter \u201cEmily\u201d (17F). Emily started her senior year a couple weeks ago, and a few days ago she texted me asking when I was going to take her to look at cars. This took me by surprise, as I didn\u2019t realize she expected a car. She has a 2.7 GPA and spends more time curating her Instagram than doing her homework. I explained to her that Christina received her car as a reward for good grades, not as a given. I later felt bad because I guess I didn\u2019t give her the same incentive that I gave Christina, and I told her that if she could get a 3.9 GPA with her senior year grades AND get into an accredited college or university, I would let her pick out a car upon graduation.\n\nI thought this was a fair deal, or even UNFAIR towards Christina since I made HER keep a 3.9 for all FOUR years of high school, but Jenny pulled me aside after Emily went to school and told me I was being unfair since Emily had different circumstances than Christina. For background, Jenny\u2019s ex husband\u2013and Emily\u2019s bio dad\u2013was a very wealthy man who spoiled the crap out of her. Everything she wanted, all she had to do was ask for, for the first 12 years of her life. She didn\u2019t try in school because her dad promised he would get her into any college she wanted, and give her a job at his company afterwards. Then, when Emily was 12, her dad was arrested for serious tax fraud. Essentially, he is in prison now, and Jenny has some money of her own but nothing compared to the life of luxury they were both used to. I think Emily is very hurt by what happened, and she also hasn\u2019t had the chance to develop a work ethic.\n\nI told Jenny that I think my only wrongdoing was not helping Emily develop a work ethic sooner, and that my hope is that she rises to the occasion, cleans up her act, and gets the car. I also said I would do everything I could to help Emily research colleges and perfect her application, but Jenny wasn\u2019t having it. She and Emily have both been giving me the cold shoulder the past couple of days and still think I\u2019m treating Emily unfairly. I really don\u2019t know what to do. I want to give Emily a goal that is challenging but attainable, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to put a strain on my relationship with my family.  \n\n\n    \n\nEdit: Formatting\n\nEdit 2: more formatting issues", "created_utc": 1693488684, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166b9mo/aita_for_buying_my_biological_daughter_a_car_but/", "score": 1488, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No. Full stop. \n\nI'd keep the offer on the table as a take-it-or-leave-it.

It\u2019s Jenny\u2019s responsibility to provide a car for her daughter.\n\nEmily\u2019s circumstances have nothing to do with it.  That is not your mess to fix.

You're not giving your daughter a car BECAUSE she's your biological child, she EARNED it.

Your wife is wrong, and she is well on her way to having an entitled lay about who can't be bothered to care for herself if she doesn't seen sense.

You're a great dad based on this and Jen giving you the cold shoulder is a total red flag. I guess bio dad being in prison meant they were out as fast as his money was taken from fraud.\n\nYour bio daughter maintained her grades and she is better for it. Why wouldn't the same apply to Emily? They're both being unreasonable here. If Jen wants her kid to have a car just because, then she should buy it. If Emily picks up the slack on her grades and gets into college a car is a great reward for doing your best. \n\nWhy would Jen want to put a wedge between you and your bio daughter by changing the rules all of a sudden, because that's what will happen, resentment that will fester?

Hell, bio daughter still has a right to be resentful even if step daughter takes this deal because she still would be doing half the work for the same reward. \n\nMy only suggestion would be to offer some other compromises that may be slightly more realistic for step-daughter to achieve. For example, instead of expecting her to get a 3.9, tell her she needs to get a part time job and save up X amount which you will match at the end of the year.

You say you don\u2019t want to place a strain on your family life, but about your relationship with your bio-daughter? This is the type of thing that could cause massive resentment and anger (towards both you and step-daughter) that will fester for a long time if you don\u2019t handle it fairly.

No one's stopping either one of them from getting jobs.", "It does say Emily is also giving him the cold shoulder.", "Yeah, the kid\u2019s dad was arrested when she was 12 so 5 years and she still not getting it? She never will.", "Eh, I can believe it pretty easily honestly. People with money always default to vague \u201cinheritance\u201d or \u201cfamily trust\u201d or \u201cinvestments\u201d as their source and it\u2019s usually considered gauche to look any further into that\u2026even within the family. \n\nWhen you\u2019re riding the gravy train you usually don\u2019t look to see who or what is driving it. You just riiiiiide.", "Exactly, I have a sister like Jenny, and her husbands (3) are just means too an end.", "My grandparents gave me my first car. It was 14 years old, hadn't been driven in 10 years, was ugly as homemade sin, but had an engine to die for and I could get that baby up over 100 mph. I was very grateful for that car.  It was a 1972 Chevy Impala. Sometimes I still miss that ugly ass car.", "You can get a safe reliable car for like 5k, \nSource... me who has never paid more than 5k for a car and have only had a serious break down once and that was after crashing into a pile of snow. If i was offered 20k for a car id ask for 5k instead amd to have the rest as a down payment for a apartment.", "> And, frankly, I found the 3.9 GPA to be an AH move for his daughter, as well.

I do think it's a high bar but the daughter agreed to it and accomplished it. She put in the time/effort/dedication to get it done for all 4 years of high school. \n\nI think him offering the 3.9 for 1 year was the fairest compromise he could make without tarnishing the work his daughter put it in.

From my experience a lot of parents who buy their kids new cars put a high value on the crash safety ratings and other safety features. For 13k you can probably find a car with backup cam, forward collision warning and lane departure stuff that do contribute a lot to safety, especially for teen drivers.\n\nAlso 15 k would be a great down payment on a condo so it really does depend a lot on what you value more. Property will appreciate and cars almost never go up in value", "You can get a safe reliable car for like 2k lol.\n\nHaven't paid more than 2k for a car in the last 13 years.", ">Sophomore year being 4-5 years ago, when Emily was 12.\n\nSophomore year is 10th grade... which would have been 1-2 years ago...", "I'm of the same mind. I like cars but I can't overspend on them. Would rather have money for emergencies or a home if I wasn't already mortgage free.", "Sophomore year of christina 19 yr old", "Idk American school ages but this sounds right. If the ex was arrested when she was 12, it doesn\u2019t make much sense for OP to have met her mother when she was 12..
