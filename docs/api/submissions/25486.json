Like someone she hasn't seen in ages is like OMG you're a mom? Congrats!\n\nKelly: *holds up 20 year old* Thank you!! Meet my bouncing new 20 year old!", "Not to mention a stepmom who has only dated the dad for five months at this point. My money is on this ending before they even walk down the aisle or another annulment.", "Best line ever!", "My brother is 39 and his fianc\u00e9e is 38.", "That when daddy gets a new wife she's now mommy? Other than that I'm not too sure.", "Exactly.. take that shit out on the brother/father ..not giggle, make someone feel awkward and ruin a special moment for them, so rude", "I mean, is it too much to ask for some normal human decency? Your niece was cruel if you ask me. She didn't need to be rude to the fiancee. So YTA for me.", "I think what sunk the fiancee was telling a 20 year old she'd be her new mom. NTA", "I think it's more the fact Kelly was acting like she was going to be a mom to a 20 year old grown woman who doesn't live with them and has a living and very involved mother. Pair that with the fact my brother paid my niece to go instead of just letting her stay away like she was going to.\n\nMy niece knows my brother well enough to know he'll probably do this for the rest of his life. We all expect it.", "she told a 20 year old she'd be her new mom. She has fault in this", "she told a 20 year she was going to be her new mom. That's weird behavior", "She's actually just a year younger than my brother, 38 to his 39.", "Your niece is legendary. NTA", "What the age difference between the fiance and the daughter?", "I mean...let's be real: she's not wrong. NTA for laughing, but I feel for the fiancee. No one wants to hear that no one thinks their relationship will last and their new family doesn't care about them or care to get to know them. It might be your brother's 7th rodeo, but maybe it's her first? Or, on the flip, even if it's her 7th too, maybe she's really desperate for it to be her last?", "A respectful moment of silence, please.", "You know she\u2019s been holding that in for years. Honestly, if Kelly had any sense she\u2019d run for the hills after that truthful announcement. The niece was doing her a favor by telling it like it is.\n\nETA: NTA.", "She chose to be with man-ho and chose to treat his daughter like a 5 year old and had a tantrum when she didn't rejoice her newest mummy dearest", "Yea I don't get all the giggles, high fives and n.t.a, when the fiance was just trying to be inclusive and be apart of the family, why is she taking the brunt of the brothers other failed relationships, take that shit out on the brother/father", "LOL.  \n\nKelly:  Hey, new daughter.  I was thinking we'd take some pictures of you naked on a bear-skin rug.  You don't mind, right?  It's for the family Christmas card.", "LOL I didn't even know they had only dated 5 months! It's definitely not going to last. But I really think that someone needs to have a conversation with the brother about his serial marriage/ engagements.", "Still seems a bit catty, but I wont go for you being the asshole.  The niece on the other hand could have been nicer for sure.", "So its that Kelly doesn't know how to interact with an adult daughter and is simply trying to build bridges so she isn't just \"the woman that doesn't bother talking to me but is married to my dad\" I guess she should've just never bothered in the first place with getting along. As an adult it's more sensible if she had simply told Kelly she isn't exactly looking for a mom this late in the game and wish her and her father the best but no, she went specifically for a dig and got what I imagined she wanted, hurts feelings, doubts, and clear disapproval from her soon to be spouses daughter. Hope they still get married... Also like you said she is 20yrs old likely meaning she has a job so it's not like being paid suddenly forced her hand.", "18 years", "It becomes impossible to take seriously at a certain point.  I feel bad for the fiancee, but she's going to be just another name from the past soon. Nobody wants to get emotionally involved with her because why cause yourself unnecessary pain?", ">Honestly, if Kelly had any sense she\u2019d run for the hills after that truthful announcement. \n\nNot just after the announcement, but after OP's brother was silent about it! He had nothing to say, he couldn't pretend she was just making shit up to scare Kelly off. He was called out with truth and couldn't refute anything his daughter said.\n\nThe niece's comment should have made Kelly reconsider, but OP's brother's silent confirmation is what should have really made her run screaming.", "nah not after the fiancee told a 20 year old she'd be her new mom", "I just wonder what can a man with seven engagements and four - yes, it's four, the annulment counts - divorces possibly say to convince the next woman that things will end differently for her?\n\nDoes either of them have a terminal illness? Because that's the only way I can see this not ending in divorce.", "If she's stuck up, she'll think she's better than anyone he's ever dated, and the others didn't work out because they weren't right for him but she is.", "Seriously, I my previous job I\u2019d see a number of single moms who had kids with guys who had a bunch of kids with random women and I was always shocked thinking, \u201cwhy do you think you\u2019re the one to change him?\u201d", "Because people are arrogant"]}
