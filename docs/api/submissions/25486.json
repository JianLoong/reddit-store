She'd focus on getting her opinion and made a suggestion of matching mother/daughter accessories for the wedding. My niece is 20 btw. Kelly was really pushing for my niece to be more present and eventually she snapped and asked her why is she not more excited for the new chapter in \"their family\" and excited to get a new mom. My niece replied that Kelly was nothing special and she's still not holding her breath that they make it down the aisle and she's not going to be excited for stepmommy number 100. She also added that even if her dad and Kelly make it down the aisle, this is not even close to his first marriage and she knows him and knows there is nothing different about this relationship so she knows it will be over within the next three years. Kelly looked so shocked but I laughed and so did my sister. Mom couldn't take her eyes off something very interesting in the corner.\n\nKelly was so offended that my sister and I laughed and she said we should be teaching our niece better.

Sounds like she's probably correct, too.", "NTA\n\nAnd if his newest fianc\u00e9e knows his history, she knew damn well she was poking a hornets nest by needling her fianc\u00e9\u2019s adult daughter.

You've all been there before plenty of times, you'll only believe she's the one when you see it, and that's something \"Kelly\" has to understand.", "NTA. Laughing at your niece's comment. I've been tempted to say the same -- my dad is on his 4th wife and had countless other relationships of varying seriousness. Fortunately, wife #4 doesn't seem all that invested in being a stepmom to my brother and I (in our 30s and 40s) and I don't really care; she's his wife until she isn't.", "Your niece rocks!!!", "I love Mom.

Your niece knows exactly who and what her dad is and let her soon to be stepmother (#100 lmao) know as well.  Frankly,  I would have howled with laughter.", "NTA - you can't control if you find something funny or not.\n\nAs for demanding an apology, sometimes the truth hurts. Maybe Kelly didn't get the full story yet in the whole _five months_ they've been dating.\n\nAnother A-H point for Kelly is asking a legal adult if they are \"excited to get a new mom.\" Lady, you're gonna be \"my dad's wife\" even if it lasts until the day you die; I dunno what else you're expecting...", "Where you all paid to go with her as well?  Where is the fiances family at these appointments?\n\nI want this info before I judge, but I am leaning towards you being TA here because of being rude.  Your brother however also is an AH for paying his daughter to go to know knowing that she was going to have a shitty attitude.\n\n5 months is a very short time before being engaged and I agree that this whole thing is suspect, but kindness doesn't cost a thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
