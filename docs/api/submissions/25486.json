No one is going to still be excited for this foolery. I agree they all suck but that doesnt exclude Kelly repeatedly trying to force a mother/daughter relationship with a 20 year old. She already has a very involved mom, she doesnt need to be happy to get a \u201cnew mom\u201d. Thats what made the niece snap at her if she wasnt being pushy it wouldnt have happened.

Maybe it's too long since I've been 20, but I don't think a 20-year-old should be so blunt to anyone unless it's some dude harassing her and not leaving her alone.
