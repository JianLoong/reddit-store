Fine. But it isn't only your big day. It is your fianc\u00e9's too.\n\nYou said yes such a great idea I'll even help you plan it but I've got to run it by my fianc\u00e9. (Maybe not word for word your post, but that was the implication.) Erm, no, wrong reaction. You made it so the groom would be the bad guy if the answer was no, and \"run it by\" sounds more like you are presenting your fianc\u00e9 with a decision already made, rather than making a decision *together as a couple*.\n\nYou presented an idea you were already sold on to your fianc\u00e9 and sulked when he said no. So you treated your fianc\u00e9 as though he'd done something wrong, and he apparently didn't feel comfortable in telling you how the request made him feel. It took days before you even asked how he felt about the idea. Implication being, your fianc\u00e9's feelings come third after your BF's and her boyfriend's.\n\nThere are a few reasons there for him to be upset. Then we get to you not understanding his position.\n\nI'm guessing your fianc\u00e9 hasn't known your best friend as long as you have. Even if he has known her all those 15 years (having been an acquaintance/friend before you started dating), he's probably not been as close to her. Ergo, your fianc\u00e9 is not as invested in her happiness. What he is invested in, however, is you as a couple and your big day.\n\nPlus the boyfriend came to you, individually, rather than present his request to the two of you as a couple. It would be easy to interpret that as BF's boyfriend has more respect of your feelings than the the groom's. A less kind interpretation is that the boyfriend did it deliberately because he thinks you will be easier to persuade/manipulate.\n\nSo yes, YTA, because not only did you exclude your fianc\u00e9 from an important conversation regarding your wedding day, but you sulked and ignored his feelings for days.\n\nPS. What \"personal reasons\" have meant they had to wait before getting engaged? I can understand personal reasons - illness, finances, family issues - resulting in people waiting before they marry, but the only personal reasons I can see that would have meant a couple having to wait before they get engaged are related to them being ill-suited as a couple, cheating, difficulties in the relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEta: To be clear, I think its great you want to share the happiness on your special day with others. I don't think you are an AH for liking the idea, it was the way you responded both to the initial question and your fianc\u00e9's response that is the issue.\n\nEta2: Actually, the more I think about it... Why aren't you encouraging the boyfriend to look at getting engaged before your wedding. You've already said your friend is \"wedding sick\" because she and her boyfriend have been together longer than you and your partner but have had to wait. You think getting engaged at your wedding will make that better? Surely, if your friend is jealous because you are not only engaged before her but getting married before she's even engaged, she would enjoy your wedding day more if she attends as a recently engaged woman rather than one who doesn't realise her fianc\u00e9 is going to pop the question sometime after the ceremony.", "YTA. If you can't figure out why, that's a you problem. How did you expect your future husband to be okay with your best friend taking the spotlight in your own wedding? Your fianc\u00e8 feels that you are prioritizing your best friend over him and your relationship with him, and that probably wasn't even the first time, it definitely wasn't, that's why.", "I\u2019m sorry, YTA. Some of you ladies don\u2019t often seem to get that it\u2019s not just *your* big day.\n\nEdit: removed rash generalisation.", "Personally, I wouldn\u2019t want to be proposed to at someone else\u2019s wedding. I think that\u2019s very overdone, & not special. Who wants to piggyback onto someone else\u2019s major event? A proposal should be an event all on its own. \n\nIf your friend is so \u201cwedding sick\u201d & her boyfriend wants to propose, why is he waiting until late January to do it?  He could make her happier much sooner. That would be good for her, and good for you too, since she\u2019ll be better able to enjoy all the planning for your wedding.", "YTA\n\nYou should have told your friends to show your fiance the respect of asking you both.\n\nYou should not have agreed before discussing it with him.\n\nYou should have not put him in a position to either say yes, or be the bad guy.\n\nYou sulked afterwards, showing him how little you value his feelings and input.\n\nHe's just got a glimpse of his future and he's probably thinking \"is this what married life will be like?\"", "You can\u2019t understand why he\u2019s upset you didn\u2019t ask him if he was okay with footing the bill for someone else\u2019s engagement???? Cause that\u2019s exactly what you were going to \u201crun by him\u201d YTA\n\npeople who propose at others weddings are tacky as hell & I would be SO embarrassed", "Why the fuck would you propose at someone else's wedding?", "From what I know, most women would not be ok with another proposal being done in their wedding because it sort of takes the attention from what should be a day about them and about the celebration of their wedding. Your fiance might be thinking that since you are ok with that, you are not as excited for your wedding as they normally are. \n\nHonestly, this is just an ASSUMPTION, have a talk with him and see what he thinks. Hopefully all should be ok after a honest talk. \n\nAnother thing, you should be consulting your fiance about things like this before giving the ok to the BF. This wedding is for both of you, not just you. So he should be ok with as well.\n\nI would give a NTA for this, but a bit of AH for not checking with fiance before.", "NAH\n\nYou ran it past your fiance, good. However, your fiance has a right to be upset when you were so excited by the prospect of it to the extent that you sulked. \n\nProposals at weddings are very divisive, especially when you hear stories about the newly engaged couple becoming the centre of attention.", "NTA: This is the first time I\u2019ve heard of a fianc\u00e9 taking as a _bad_ sign that his fianc\u00e9e is _generous_ with the spotlight on her wedding day. To illustrate how silly your fianc\u00e9 is being, it\u2019s only one rung above prohibiting you from throwing the bouquet.\n\nSome people watch _The Godfather_ and infer Italian weddings are about the community coming to kiss the bride's father's ring. Instead the generosity is going in the other direction. The bride's father now breathes a sigh of relief, finally assured in the knowledge of who is taking on the burden of protection of his daughter, and so is expected to grant any favors asked of him. Weddings are a celebration of love and a reaffirmation of connection with the community, not an adolescent jockeying for attention and adulation.\n\n> made him think maybe\n\nThat is one bat-shit crazy example of jumping to conclusions.", "NTA. He's being a bit weird about it. \n\nI think it all comes down to timing. Like, if they did it during your vows, that'd be insane. But there's a very traditional point in the wedding when you toss the bouquet, with, of course, the person catching it being the next to marry. Happens at the end of the reception, when your wedding is essentially finished. Doing it then, with your friend directly tossed the bouquet and her bf ready with a ring to propose would be absolutely fine, and more in the spirit of keeping the wedding vibe going then drawing focus.\n\nIt does put your friend a bit on the spot, so worth being sure that she'd want that, but I think your fiance is being a little oversensitive. It's a small additional event that takes place a couple of hours after the wedding itself.", "NTA. I get so sick of precious brides going mad because someone said or did something insignificant that they felt \"upstaged\" them, and you did exactly what I would have done for someone I cared about, with the same excitement.  I think the fianc\u00e9 is being slightly childish in thinking sharing your special day means his proposal wasn't as important. \n\nPerhaps reassuring him will help. But you are amazing", "NTA. You ran it by him.   Most people would advise against the idea, however.  You got the response most would get. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is being a little dramatic.  He\u2019s projecting his insecurities onto you.", "Okay couple of things . By run it by I meant 'this will be okay for you to do as long as my fiance agrees to it because I am okay with it but his decision matters equally.' It could go in a his opinion matters less direction but I never thought of it that way plus he knows I think wedding proposals are cute . \n\nAs to why the bf contacted only me . Well we are in the same class and it's just easier that way. It was more of a hey I have this idea vibe than a I really wanna do this vibe . \n\nMy fiance is extremely extremely introverted and it takes me days to get an answers . He told me two weeks after we went to a certain restaurant that he hated the food and wouldn't be willing to go again .\n\nAs for the personal reasons I will not be going into detail the most I can say is there was some disapproval from the families", "Honestly, no one is the butthole (NTA). You were ok with the idea of them proposing in your wedding, so you went over to ask ur fiancee and he said no, and you respected that. Although it is understandable for him to feel that way. Honestly, it was not an asshole thing to do OP, but cmon, its YOUR wedding, and having the idea for someone else propose at YOUR wedding is just dumb.

I wouldn't be mad neither if somebody wanted to propose on my wedding, especially if it was someone close and important to me. I'm just pointing out what is sort of general behaviour by other people. \n\nMaybe your fiance is just bothered with the fact that other women wouldn't want that because IN THEIR MINDS, that day is too important for them that they don't wanna share the spotlight with another person. So unconsciously he thinks that day is not as important for you. Again. This is all an assumption.
