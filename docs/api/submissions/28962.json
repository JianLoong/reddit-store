Fine. But it isn't only your big day. It is your fianc\u00e9's too.\n\nYou said yes such a great idea I'll even help you plan it but I've got to run it by my fianc\u00e9. (Maybe not word for word your post, but that was the implication.) Erm, no, wrong reaction. You made it so the groom would be the bad guy if the answer was no, and \"run it by\" sounds more like you are presenting your fianc\u00e9 with a decision already made, rather than making a decision *together as a couple*.\n\nYou presented an idea you were already sold on to your fianc\u00e9 and sulked when he said no. So you treated your fianc\u00e9 as though he'd done something wrong, and he apparently didn't feel comfortable in telling you how the request made him feel. It took days before you even asked how he felt about the idea. Implication being, your fianc\u00e9's feelings come third after your BF's and her boyfriend's.\n\nThere are a few reasons there for him to be upset. Then we get to you not understanding his position.\n\nI'm guessing your fianc\u00e9 hasn't known your best friend as long as you have. Even if he has known her all those 15 years (having been an acquaintance/friend before you started dating), he's probably not been as close to her. Ergo, your fianc\u00e9 is not as invested in her happiness. What he is invested in, however, is you as a couple and your big day.\n\nPlus the boyfriend came to you, individually, rather than present his request to the two of you as a couple. It would be easy to interpret that as BF's boyfriend has more respect of your feelings than the the groom's. A less kind interpretation is that the boyfriend did it deliberately because he thinks you will be easier to persuade/manipulate.\n\nSo yes, YTA, because not only did you exclude your fianc\u00e9 from an important conversation regarding your wedding day, but you sulked and ignored his feelings for days.\n\nPS. What \"personal reasons\" have meant they had to wait before getting engaged? I can understand personal reasons - illness, finances, family issues - resulting in people waiting before they marry, but the only personal reasons I can see that would have meant a couple having to wait before they get engaged are related to them being ill-suited as a couple, cheating, difficulties in the relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEta: To be clear, I think its great you want to share the happiness on your special day with others. I don't think you are an AH for liking the idea, it was the way you responded both to the initial question and your fianc\u00e9's response that is the issue.\n\nEta2: Actually, the more I think about it... Why aren't you encouraging the boyfriend to look at getting engaged before your wedding. You've already said your friend is \"wedding sick\" because she and her boyfriend have been together longer than you and your partner but have had to wait. You think getting engaged at your wedding will make that better? Surely, if your friend is jealous because you are not only engaged before her but getting married before she's even engaged, she would enjoy your wedding day more if she attends as a recently engaged woman rather than one who doesn't realise her fianc\u00e9 is going to pop the question sometime after the ceremony.", "YTA. If you can't figure out why, that's a you problem. How did you expect your future husband to be okay with your best friend taking the spotlight in your own wedding? Your fianc\u00e8 feels that you are prioritizing your best friend over him and your relationship with him, and that probably wasn't even the first time, it definitely wasn't, that's why.", "I\u2019m sorry, YTA. Some of you ladies don\u2019t often seem to get that it\u2019s not just *your* big day.\n\nEdit: removed rash generalisation.", "Personally, I wouldn\u2019t want to be proposed to at someone else\u2019s wedding. I think that\u2019s very overdone, & not special. Who wants to piggyback onto someone else\u2019s major event? A proposal should be an event all on its own. \n\nIf your friend is so \u201cwedding sick\u201d & her boyfriend wants to propose, why is he waiting until late January to do it?  He could make her happier much sooner. That would be good for her, and good for you too, since she\u2019ll be better able to enjoy all the planning for your wedding.", "YTA\n\nYou should have told your friends to show your fiance the respect of asking you both.\n\nYou should not have agreed before discussing it with him.\n\nYou should have not put him in a position to either say yes, or be the bad guy.\n\nYou sulked afterwards, showing him how little you value his feelings and input.\n\nHe's just got a glimpse of his future and he's probably thinking \"is this what married life will be like?\"", "You can\u2019t understand why he\u2019s upset you didn\u2019t ask him if he was okay with footing the bill for someone else\u2019s engagement???? Cause that\u2019s exactly what you were going to \u201crun by him\u201d YTA\n\npeople who propose at others weddings are tacky as hell & I would be SO embarrassed", "Why the fuck would you propose at someone else's wedding?", "From what I know, most women would not be ok with another proposal being done in their wedding because it sort of takes the attention from what should be a day about them and about the celebration of their wedding. Your fiance might be thinking that since you are ok with that, you are not as excited for your wedding as they normally are. \n\nHonestly, this is just an ASSUMPTION, have a talk with him and see what he thinks. Hopefully all should be ok after a honest talk. \n\nAnother thing, you should be consulting your fiance about things like this before giving the ok to the BF. This wedding is for both of you, not just you. So he should be ok with as well.\n\nI would give a NTA for this, but a bit of AH for not checking with fiance before.", "[deleted]", "NTA: This is the first time I\u2019ve heard of a fianc\u00e9 taking as a _bad_ sign that his fianc\u00e9e is _generous_ with the spotlight on her wedding day. To illustrate how silly your fianc\u00e9 is being, it\u2019s only one rung above prohibiting you from throwing the bouquet.\n\nSome people watch _The Godfather_ and infer Italian weddings are about the community coming to kiss the bride's father's ring. Instead the generosity is going in the other direction. The bride's father now breathes a sigh of relief, finally assured in the knowledge of who is taking on the burden of protection of his daughter, and so is expected to grant any favors asked of him. Weddings are a celebration of love and a reaffirmation of connection with the community, not an adolescent jockeying for attention and adulation.\n\n> made him think maybe\n\nThat is one bat-shit crazy example of jumping to conclusions.", "NTA. He's being a bit weird about it. \n\nI think it all comes down to timing. Like, if they did it during your vows, that'd be insane. But there's a very traditional point in the wedding when you toss the bouquet, with, of course, the person catching it being the next to marry. Happens at the end of the reception, when your wedding is essentially finished. Doing it then, with your friend directly tossed the bouquet and her bf ready with a ring to propose would be absolutely fine, and more in the spirit of keeping the wedding vibe going then drawing focus.\n\nIt does put your friend a bit on the spot, so worth being sure that she'd want that, but I think your fiance is being a little oversensitive. It's a small additional event that takes place a couple of hours after the wedding itself.", "NTA. I get so sick of precious brides going mad because someone said or did something insignificant that they felt \"upstaged\" them, and you did exactly what I would have done for someone I cared about, with the same excitement.  I think the fianc\u00e9 is being slightly childish in thinking sharing your special day means his proposal wasn't as important. \n\nPerhaps reassuring him will help. But you are amazing", "NTA. You ran it by him.   Most people would advise against the idea, however.  You got the response most would get. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is being a little dramatic.  He\u2019s projecting his insecurities onto you.", "Okay couple of things . By run it by I meant 'this will be okay for you to do as long as my fiance agrees to it because I am okay with it but his decision matters equally.' It could go in a his opinion matters less direction but I never thought of it that way plus he knows I think wedding proposals are cute . \n\nAs to why the bf contacted only me . Well we are in the same class and it's just easier that way. It was more of a hey I have this idea vibe than a I really wanna do this vibe . \n\nMy fiance is extremely extremely introverted and it takes me days to get an answers . He told me two weeks after we went to a certain restaurant that he hated the food and wouldn't be willing to go again .\n\nAs for the personal reasons I will not be going into detail the most I can say is there was some disapproval from the families", "Honestly, no one is the butthole (NTA). You were ok with the idea of them proposing in your wedding, so you went over to ask ur fiancee and he said no, and you respected that. Although it is understandable for him to feel that way. Honestly, it was not an asshole thing to do OP, but cmon, its YOUR wedding, and having the idea for someone else propose at YOUR wedding is just dumb.

Yup that's gonna bring you down real fast. Instead of publically or privately celebrating your own love, you're swearing as you peel off your friend's shapewear and fetch her makeup remover. Not sexy.\n\nYou've got to help your friends boyfriend get his head out his own butt here. If they want to be engaged and they've had to wait and she's already wedding sick, and he's ready too, he needs to propose. Right away.  There is no reason to wait and she doesn't need to go through a whole holiday season feeling blue and shoving her feelings down. Tell him to get on one knee ASAP. \n\nThis man is clueless. Give him a dang clue. And help him plan a good proposal for sometime in the next 30 days.\n\nNAH.", "Nta but why are you OK to share your wedding day with anyone except your SO.", "NTA. Aside from some sulking, I think you handled this pretty well.", "Accidentally TA. I\u2019m actually going to give you a lot of slack here, because I think you genuinely are just the type of person who gets excited by other people\u2019s happiness. And I think that\u2019s something that should be protected and that your fianc\u00e9 is a really lucky guy for. I also think that you are a genuinely good person. It seems like you\u2019ve really sought to understand how and why he feels the way he does. That said, I think your automatic excitement has inadvertently put your fianc\u00e9 into the villainous position. I read your clarification that you meant you\u2019re ok with it as long as he is, but that still puts him in the hot seat. And for an introvert, that\u2026 Sucks. However, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re prioritizing their happiness over your wedding. With the limited information I have, this feels like that scene where Barbie enters the real world. Your genuine goodness causes accidental conflict in a selfish world.", "I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call you an ahole.\nProbably just a bit programmed by society to think of your big day as mainly for the bride and not expecting the groom to feel as strongly as your fianc\u00e9 seems to.\nYou\u2019re fianc\u00e9 is very insecure or very needy of both for some reason\u2026", "Your fianc\u00e9 should be more mature than that. You should be disappointed. Then again, can your friends do this in another room towards the end or at the end of your celebration. They don\u2019t have to steal the scene for ten minutes. My wife and I were celebrating fortieth wedding anniversary the day after her best friend\u2019s daughter\u2019s wedding. Not a word said to the friend until the day after.", "NTA.\n\nHe needs to grow up. Weddings aren't that big a deal. Did he care about *being married to you* and the life you'll be building together (in which your loved ones will also be a part of your future) or about *the wedding*?", "Absolutely YTA\n\nIt's a SHARED day, and if your fiance isn't enthused about it, then the answer is no.\n\nFrankly, people using other people's events for proposals is generally tacky anyway", "Yta. You are forgetting on thing dear. This is not just your wedding. This is his wedding to. How can you tell someone you are okay with them proposing, taking away your thunder and all the attention without discussing with your fiance? Ofcourse he is hurt. He is hurt that you would let someone propose at your wedding reception. And he is hurt because, you decided to make the wedding all about yourself, your MOH you have been friends with since you were 10, and her boyfriend. You decided to leave your fiance as an afterthought with this. If the wedding has not yet happened, then please tell the boyfriend to not propose. I will not be surprised if your husband called of the wedding, which, if i was in his place i would have. Atleast call it off till you understand and can make it upto him.", "N T A for how you felt about the proposal however a gentle YTA for not respecting your fianc\u00e9\u2019s feelings and choice.", "YTA. Your future husband is more important than your friend. His feelings are your priority. It is really an AH move to propose to someone at another couple\u2019s wedding; really bad manners. You should have never acted like you were ok with this until you spoke with your fianc\u00e9 first. He is probably rethinking marrying you. You need to grow up.", "YTA - It is not only your wedding", "This is a \u201c2 yes, 1 no\u201d situation.", "Omg this! Whytf do people do this!?  So tacky", "Yes yes yes... everything you said is perfect", "I hope OP reads this answer carefully!", "I think the friend's boyfriend asked the soon to be bride because weddings more revolve around the bride then does the groom. I know some people gonna say differently, but we all know that it's true, and how its such a special day for the bride. I'm assuming the boyfriend probably thought the groom wouldn't think much of it, which is where the mistake lies, but But I do understand the logic.", "I agree.  I think if it was me, I'd plan a Halloween proposal to do it sooner.   Or a Thanksgiving one.  Or just a fall foliage.  So many possibilities!", "Imagine she says \"no I don't\" and now the wedding party is ruined as everybody is gossiping on full voice ,or just crying...", "Exactly this, OP is a big narcissist, she cares only about herself and a bit about her best friend, she barely gives any crap about how her fianc\u00e9 feels. He must be a saint to even propose to op.", "You can always spot the bitter single ones.\n\nOP: had totally moved on from the subject\n\nYou: she must have been NAGGING like ALL WOMEN DO. She had to be ALWAYS ignoring his needs.\n\nLike, is this incel or projection? Who can say? Who would care?", "Then CPR, then zap them again just to get the point across SUFFICIENTLY", "Correction she said yes and I will even help plan then said just let me run it by my fianc\u00e9. That straight away if she had said let me talk with fianc\u00e9 and let you know then I would agree but now she had just said my fianc\u00e9 said no. I have to say the way op posts I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she helps him do it just before or towards the end of the reception excusing it as it doesn\u2019t count because the wedding is over/hasn\u2019t started.", "YTA - this isn\u2019t helping your case. He said no and he wasn\u2019t comfortable with it and that should have been the end of it. The fact that you keep pushing this and trying to force him to justify why is problematic behavior on your part. \n\n\u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence. Accept that he doesn\u2019t want your best friend being a part of the spotlight at the wedding. If you respect your fianc\u00e9, go to the boyfriend apologize and say you should never have made any assumptions or said yes before speaking with your fianc\u00e9 and make it very clear there is to be no proposals at your wedding.", "The fact that you sulked around after not getting your way is extremely immature. I bet he was clocking those vibes and it's contributing to how he's feeling off about you now. Even doubt. Do you often sulk when you don't get your way? \n\nYou know how he feels. Do not bring it up again. *Do not let your friend's boyfriend propose at your wedding.* Do not start your marriage off by pressuring him into giving up what is supposed to be one of the best days of his life to another couple's proposal.\n\nThe fact that you can't empathize is concerning. Either you're too clueless or too self-involved.", "You made him the bad guy. You sulked. You are still trying to manipulate him into doing it.\n\nI don't think you understand what being a good partner is.\n\nI'm not going to argue w/ your other points, but the idea that you want to do this b/c then everyone will remember your wedding when they think ofntheir egagement is really \"Main Character\" syndrome.", "[removed]", "It\u2019s a difficult one on the selfish part because yes, she was going to potentially ruin the day for her future husband BUT she was also willing to give up that attention at the end of the wedding events to see her best friend happy. \n\nI actually think the fianc\u00e9 is the AH for not trying to find a mutual ground on it (like it can only happen after the speeches, first dance etc) before dismissing it.", "Plus, the people at the wedding probably won't know the bride gave permission, so to them it's going to look super tacky.  She could get very embarrassed over looking bad to the other guests.  People might talk.  If there is a drama lama at the wedding they might get in their head to spill wine as vengeance.  There are just some things that will look bad regardless of permission.", "She won\u2019t it doesn\u2019t reinforce the victim narrative she\u2019s portraying.", "I am a happily married woman of many years but I can see from OP's post that she doesn't put her future husband's feelings first.  So dear person you stop projecting and assuming who I am.  You seem anxious to think I am a man who is critical of a woman. Didn't say ALL WOMEN nor ALWAYS.  That is your own bitterness to assume that.  I'm sorry for you", "From OP:\n\n>We've discussed this a bunch of times since it happened and in his words he can't seem to figure out what is bothering him but the fact remains that he is .", "It\u2019s. His. Day. Too.\n\n*We've discussed this a bunch of times since it happened*\n\nAre you wanting an answer for why he\u2019s upset so he can process his emotions, or are you pushing him to justify his reaction? Those are two very different things.\n\nConsider this: \u201cNo\u201c is a complete sentence.", "Oh no, he knows exactly what is bothering him. I've been in the same situation as him and use those words. What he's actually saying is that he can't figure how to tell you because you're a brick wall. He can't tell you the truth, let that sink in. \n\nAnything he says, he knows you will just try to excuse or work around. People like you only ask for whats wrong so you can \"solve\" the issue in a way that works for you. If he truly thought you would care about why he's upset and just LEAVE it at that, he would tell you. Instead he knows you'll just give him a bunch of solutions that revolve in you getting whay you want. You're doing it in this comment. 50 excuses and justifications.\n\nThe only solution he cares about is that you accept he doesn't like it, tell the BF to go propose somewhere else and then let this situation die in the past where it belongs.

I would be having 2nd thoughts now. My best advice to you is get your moh bf to propose at Xmas because that won\u2019t be cancelled and right now if you don\u2019t take a good look at yourself your wedding might be.", "Why is there still discussions happening?", "Is there any way I can pull your fianc\u00e9 aside and tell him to run?", "YTA. What an awful comment. Just stop trying to defend yourself bc you\u2019re making it worse. \n\nIt\u2019s HIS wedding day too. Doesn\u2019t matter that he can\u2019t figure out why it bothers him, it does! It was his decision too not just yours. \n\nYOU should have asked him before saying yes. You\u2019re also putting your bf\u2019s thoughts and well being before your future husbands. You\u2019re making HER the priority not HIM. On his wedding day to you! \n\nStep up and be better to your man before he calls off the wedding.", "So you love your friendship more than your soon to be husband. YTA", "You sulked when you didn\u2019t get your way. That\u2019s also why your fianc\u00e9 takes a long time to tell you how he really feels. But even after he does , you are unhappy about it and want to get your own way. Maybe you don\u2019t prioritize him enough like he said. Think about the wedding and why your best friend is more important than your fianc\u00e9. And please call it off if you are really not as excited about the wedding and not as excited about your own fianc\u00e9.", "Every comment I\u2019ve seen from you just makes the situation sound even worse; you need to listen to your fianc\u00e9 better and respect his feelings.

How selfish and and greedy to take an event that others have planned and paid for to provide a backdrop for his own unrelated moment? How lazy to not plan something tailored to his gf and to make her wait for someone else's wedding instead of caring enough about her to give her her own moment. I would judge the boyfriend HARD. \n\n2. How narcissistic to hold hostage a bunch of people that came together, made travel plans, paid for gifts and lodging, to his personal moment? Public proposals are often really cringey to begin with, but using the loved ones of other people for attention points? Gross. If he wants an audience, get together HIS and his gf's loved ones, not those there to celebrate other people. I would judge the gf hard if she said yes to him. \n\nEven if I knew the newlywed couple has approved of it, I would still judge the bf and be annoyed at the newlyweds.", "You are the only person in the world that finds them cute. Everyone else HATES them, thinks they are dumb amd selfish", "You're delusional as hell mate, 99% you're a women... It's pretty obvious given  what op writes that she prioritizes her best friend over her fianc\u00e8. Why he should even want to ruin his own wedding day for someone else? Op behavior is definitely a pattern, because she was willing to give up the attention of her and fianc\u00e8 wedding, for her best firiend's sake, she said yes to that indecent proposal and now she's probably resenting  her fianc\u00e8 for not bending for her best firend.", "Easy way to solve this problem would be for the bridge or groom to say \u201c_so and so_ has something they would like to announce\u201d", "True facts.
