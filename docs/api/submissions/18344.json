Sounds to me like she thought of her name was on it, this would be her brand new car you were buying her. I would be happy if I had zero legal obligation personally. You dodged a major gold digger and got a new car all in one day. Congrats on both.", "I\u2019d love to see what \u2018legal\u2019 would get involved in this! \n\nOverall, this is an NTA. You\u2019re not married yet, and even if you were, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for spouses to own different cars. And, it is completely unreasonable for her to ask to drive the car first. \n\nAlso, you said you didn\u2019t want her to be liable, which I assumes means you\u2019ll be making payments on the car. Did your ex talk to you beforehand to say she\u2019d be happy to make payments as well? It doesn\u2019t sound like it. It doesn\u2019t really sound like you had a proper conversation about the finances and ownership of the car beforehand though. \n\nMy last point is - why are you getting engaged to a 20-year-old?! Dude\u2026", "NTA - \"huh?\" indeed.  And the legal bit?  WTH?  These women are daft.", "NTA. I feel like this one is as simple as your car, your rules. You didn't ask for a cosigner, didn't ask for monetary help, did it all yourself.... therefore, C had no right to anything regarding the car.\n\nNow you just need to keep a close eye on your car and make sure they don't do anything crazy to it....", "NTA. Aww, how cute. She thought you were buying her a car.", "NTA.   People can sue for anything.  However you are well within your rights to deny her both use of the car as well being on a car note.  \n\nAnd dare i say you dodged a bullet.", "NTA \n\nThe audacity to insist that she take the first drive in YOUR new car. I\u2019m guessing you paid for the whole thing?\n\nNot sure what your ex-fianc\u00e9e has been telling her mum but I think she was wanting to sign for other reasons, not to just \u201chelp you out\u201d. How is her co-signing helping you whatsoever? Sounds like more mess to fix when you broke up. \n\nEdit: why is she getting angry at you for not needing the help? Kind of weird reaction in my opinion.", " NTA. I just purchased a new car. I can\u2019t imagine if someone I\u2019m dating assumes they\u2019re going to co-sign and be on the title. Curious about what the conversations were like prior to sitting in the finance office at the dealership. How could that even be an assumption? And THEN she wants to drive YOUR NEW CAR to her parents while you follow in her car. Sounds like some major communication issues or a lot of assumptions were being made here. Sounds like you dodged a bullet.", "This is all so weird. NTA for doing the right thing.\n\nSorry about your relationship.", "Huh? What are you confused about? I would've slipped my sunglasses on turned up the radio and driven off with a smile.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but\u2026\u2026 This made my head hurt.", "Thank the lord for small favors?\n\nI mean, it sounds like you didn\u2019t even know enough to k ow you were in jail, and got handed a get out of jail free card. Thank the heavens and move on.\n\nNTA", "What the what?\n\nI am soo confused but going with \n\nNTA", "Her and her mom are trying to steal from you. By co signing she would take the car, break up with you and leave you to pay for the car,  you could do nothing about it as her name was on the papers too. \n\nYou dodged a bullet here buddy. \n\nUpdate us on what \"legal\" she thinks she can get. Would love to see her and her mom fall flat on their faces.", "Holy shit. I mean, as your fiance, there's an expectation, but she did just assume and her mom is straight up cray for even bringing up deeper shit. \n\nNTA", "I was watching a hockey game while typing this, so my bad if it was confusing. TLDR: I didn\u2019t let my fianc\u00e9 drive my car, her and her mom got upset, she broke up with me and mentioned something about legal. \n\nHer and I met at my college last year, dated for a year, she proposed to me.", "NTA.  She thought it was hers.  She was wrong.", "NTA. Congratulations on dodging that bullet-yikes!", "Be happy you dodged a bullet here. Sounds like mom and daughter are on a totally different page than you. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Sounds like she is a total gold digger.  You bought the car, paid/financed it yourself and she wants to be the first to drive it and tells her mom it is her car?  Then they tell you off for not more or less giving her the car.  Count yourself lucky that she is not on the title of it. As for the \"legal \"did have a joint account that you took money out to buy the car?  That would possibly be a legal issue in her mind.  Block her, her mother and move on in life.  Let her propose to someone else.", "NTA \n\nDodged a bullet my dude.", "NTA sounds like she was planning on breaking up and taking the car.", "NTA. You were buying the car. Not you and C", "Why would op talk about finances on his own car with his fianc\u00e9? She has her own car. Sounds like a con and/or entitlement on the fianc\u00e9\u2019s part. OP - I your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t living with you. This is sketchy.", "NTA.\n\nBut\u2026 can I talk from another perspective for a moment? See a fianc\u00e9 is a person you are promising to marry. It\u2019s a holding title for the person who is more than a GF, but not yet gone through the legal rites for marriage.\n\nA married person automatically gets half of assets in a marriage (depending where you live this may vary, but in Australia this is the case), and the ownership of a new car bought while engaged would be considered in the division of assets (regardless of whose name it was in), as there is evidence that the relationship is a) in existence at that time, and b) is planned to be permanent.  The consideration might come to nothing, but there may be legal recourse (particularly if the couple were living together and a de facto relationship, which has similar legal protections in Australia to marriage). \n\nSo\u2026 don\u2019t propose to people you don\u2019t plan to marry. And don\u2019t buy cars with fiances if you don\u2019t trust them enough to be on the paperwork.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
