His mom said she would go to the kitchen to get some scissors and I told her not to worry about it because I had a knife in my purse.

For the record, the blade on my knife is fairly small at about 1.5in, I just leave it in my wallet in case I need it, I've had knives for a huge chunk of my life because my family is very outdoorsy and we'd go camping fairly often which got my dad to get me my first knife. \n\nImmediately after using my knife the mother told me to leave her home. I was a bit confused and asked what was going on. She explained that she was shocked that I thought it was appropriate to bring a \"dangerous weapon\" into her home and to use it so casually near her son. I apologized to her and explained that, to me, I didn't think my knife was a problem and it's something I take with me everywhere. This ended up upsetting her even more as she walked me to the door and explained not only that she would be reporting this to the company that I work for but that she would warn her friends to request a different tutor other than me if they were ever looking for a tutor. Again I apologized and explained to her that my knife stays zipped in my wallet and that it locks shut so the odds of it doing any damage are basically non existent. Before leaving the house she brought up that her son could have found it and cut himself if he looked in my bag while I was at the wash room and told me that I should reevaluate my career if I thought this was appropriate. \n\nSo am I dummy for brining a knife to work?

It would be pretty reasonable to me had the mom simply kindly requested that you not bring a knife into her house (or otherwise cancel the tutoring).

Yes, it can be used as a weapon, but it is a tool first and foremost.", "NTA \n\nBut it definitely wasn't a smart move to bring a knife with you.

If the same thing applies to your area the mother wouldn't think you would carry a knife while tutoring. Your a tutor pretty much a teacher helping a kid learn at their house and the mother might see it as unprofessional. Also are you close to the family your tutoring? I would feel uneasy if a tutor I don't know well brought a knife to my house near my child even if they mean no harm.\n\nI think the mother is a total AH for acting this way. You are very much less of an AH I just think you were overlooking that this can be seen as unprofessional.
