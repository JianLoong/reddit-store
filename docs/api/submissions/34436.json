I'm sorry your mom can't see that the most compassionate thing is letting her go when the time comes that her quality of life isn't good anymore.  Its the saddest part of pet ownership, I'm so sorry you're having to experience this.  Please don't beat yourself up, you are making the right call.

She spent thousands on that dog's treatment, and the end result was the same; the dog lived maybe 2-3 additional months, and his quality of live was abysmal.\n\nYour mother's attitude is unfortunate. In the end, she'll hopefully realize that prolonging your dog's pain for her comfort is selfish and cruel.", "NTA, I just put down my 17 year old pug the day after Christmas . He had so many masses. I should have not waited so long.", "NTA. You hear people who go through cancer treatments and they say it\u2019s hell. Your dog may not have much time left. It\u2019s better not to torture her.

I made a similar choice for my dog even though he was only 11, I had watched other animals go through major medical treatments and knew that with everything he needed he would be miserable, in pain, and wouldn't understand also it was SO expensive, like, having a 2nd child or doing treatment that might not even help ( the surgery alone might have killed him ). If I make it to 80+ I probably wouldn't try to treat my cancer either and I am a human. \n\nIt feels hard, but dogs are not supposed to live forever, and keeping them alive and in pain is just something selfish we do for us, not for them.", "NTA, your mom is.  \nThere is always a possibility the treatment won't work as well.

Worse, you might get the surgery and she dies a few days later anyway", "NTA.  I'm sorry your dog has received this diagnosis.  Unfortunately there's no 'saving' any of us from living out our natural lifespan.  Time comes for us all.  Sure, you could bankrupt yourself paying for treatment and she could live an extra few months... but in the end she's still 16 years old.  Her quality of life may not be as good for those months if she's having surgery/treatments.  Your mom is not telling the real story here... this isn't a puppy with a fixable injury who will go on to live years of happy, active life if you ' save' her via medical intervention.  This is an elderly animal who has already lived a good life whose life MIGHT be extended by some months if you 'save' her with a treatment that may not even be effective and may be stressful to her.  \n\nI say you cherish the days with your dog as long as she is comfortable.  Give her treats and love her up and take pictures and make memories.  And when she's no longer enjoying life, let her go.  It's the kindest thing you can do for her, no matter what your mom says.", "NTA.  At her age, there are no guarantees that she would necessarily survive a big surgery and you would still be out a large sum of money.  Pet owners often have to make the hard decision to be able to let their pets go.  It\u2019s heartbreaking but it can be the right decision.  You have given her 16 wonderful years and need to follow your heart.  \n\nCancer treatments can be brutal for any living beings and there are no guarantees for a positive long term outcome.", "NTA you really do love the dog which is why you\u2019re keeping her from months of unnecessary pain. Time to tell your mom she can shut her mouth and enjoy your dog while she\u2019s still here or leave. If she\u2019s not willing to part with $10k then her opinion does not fucking matter and she should not come to your home and say hurtful things.", "NTA At all.  At you dog's age it would probably be cruel to put it through a confusing and painful treatment.  Keep them comfortable and make sure you stay with them and comfort them when they cross over.  Don't feel guilty just love on them more.", "NTA - I am a dog lover and a dog owner. I had to put down my beloved Casey early last year. He was a great dog. Got him as a rescue when he was about 4 and had him for 8 years. He seemed very healthy and energetic.\n\nSuddenly he started having breathing problems. We took him in to the vet and they did an enhanced x-ray and found he had a large mass in his chest that was putting pressure on his heart and lungs -  basically his chest cavity didn't have enough room to expand with his heart and lungs trying to move. Our choice was surgery and followup chemo or putting him down. \n\nWe did research and found that surgery and chemo treatment was usually successful and he would live for 13 more months (on average), IF we did the treatment. So let's see, he would have MAJOR chest surgery followed by 2-3 months of recovery (lots of pain and discomfort) along with 2-3 months of chemo (which would cause more pain and discomfort). All this, which would cost thousands of $, so he could live another 13 months (if successful). \n\nWe put him down before he started suffering. It was a pretty tough time but we have no regrets.", "NTA.  You are not a bad person. It's not just about money, it's about quality of life.  Your dear old pupper is already on the decline from a wonderful life.  That's okay.  She will let you know when she's is ready to go.  \n\nI feel right where you are: there's a good probability that our 9 1/2 yr Staffy (they live to be 10-12) has prostate cancer.  He has spondylosis that may have resulted in nerve damage. He cannot empty his own bladder; we catheterize him twice a day, and he's on a lot of meds while we see if we can reduce the prostate.  And we're not putting him down because on meds, he's still a happy, frisky older dog.  But should it be cancer, we will not opt for surgery, as the survival rate isn't good.", "NTA. It's a very personal decision. It's horrible to have to deny your pet the lifesaving care because it's so expensive. You're in a terrible position, and I'm very sorry for that. Your mom is just making things harder for you.", "NTA, and I'm sorry you're going through this, both the pain of your dog being ill and the guilt.\n\nI was in a similar situation years back with my cat but I opted for the surgery. I took a huge financial hit and he was good for a few more years so I felt like my decision was justified. Until he need another surgery. \n\nEventually he ended up passing and now I have a bit of resentment about the situation, it was a lot of money to spend for a short time of happiness and in reality it was to make me happy, not my cat. Which sounds the same for you, the surgery isn't to help your dog (in the long run) its just to make your mom happy. I almost went with the second surgery because at the time I felt the same as your mom, no amount of money is too much to save this cat, but in the end my mom talked some sense into me and helped me see what the recovery would be like and weighed the pros and cons. All the trips to the vet, the recovery, the meds, the chemo, the stress and anxiety your dog would be going through during that time, is that part really worth it? \n\nIt sounds like your dog has had a long and happy life thanks to you, you've done a great job so far and have nothing to be ashamed of.", "NTA - I'm so sorry, this is such a heartbreaking situation to be in. Like some other commentors have mentioned, your dog has lived a long and happy life, but surgery and cancer treatment is hell and will be incredibly rough on an animal that is already very well into her senior years. Caring for our pets means ensuring that their quality of life is good, not just quantity. Making the best choice for them means letting them go and not prolonging their suffering. \n\nYour mom is a major AH. The things she's saying \"to the dog\" in front of you about you'd do this thing if you loved her, are absolutely vile and cruel. If someone did that to me I would never talk to them again.", "NTA. \n\nMoney aside, putting a 16-year-old dog through that treatment is just cruel. It would not save her, it would *maybe* extend her life a bit. Bit that life would be full of vet trips, medications, pain.\n\nGive her the best days you can and cherish them. \n\nI sympathize with your mom, I do. She is not trying to be an \"asshole\", she is probably just in shock as well. My dog was 12 when she got sick unexpectedly and we had to let her go. They told us we could transfer her to emergency care but she was almost comatose at that point. I couldn't imagine sending her off to some scary, sterile environment where she might spend her last moments. I would've done anything for her, including thousands if dollars (which I'd already spent by that point too) but I couldn't let her suffer just to keep her with me for longer. \n\nYou're doing the right thing, and I'm sorry.", "NTA.  Here's your top concern: what would her quality of life be?  It doesn't sound like it would be a good one.  Keeping animals alive to appease people when the animal will have a poor quality of life is the worst form of animal abuse IMO.  So far I've had to make this difficult decision for three of my dogs.  Do what's best for her.\n\nOn another note \"I can afford it, but it will wipe out my savings and require me to take on a lot of debt to boot.\". We have very different definitions of afford.  If it wipes out your savings and gives you debt that's not affordable in my book.", "NTA and DON'T beat yourself up about this. \n\nI had an elderly dog with cancer. It's not just the money, it's the risk of surgery. My vet told me they'd go ahead if I wanted it, but the chances of even coming out of surgery alive were slim. Surgery on a dog that age is also sure to cause them misery. \n\nYour mother is being cruel, selfish and definitely the AH. Concentrate on giving your pupper the best days, now that the end is close.", "NTA - I am the BIGGEST dog lover in the world and I still think you are making the right decision. You are NOT a monster if you don't do any treatment.\n\nAny treatment you gave this dog would be for YOU and YOUR MOM, not for your dog. I'm honestly surprised your vet is even offering the option. Chemo is usually only offered to younger dogs because they can both handle the treatment (it has side effects, as it does in humans) and there's a significant upside (the dog *could* live many more years).\n\nFWIW, we had a dog who developed a very rare type of cancer (my vet had seen only one other case of it in a 30 year career). We opted for surgery initially - because of the tumor and its location, we had to go to a specialist and it was $$$. But, we wanted to give her a chance. She had the surgery, and while there were some complications, it was ultimately a success...for three months, at which time the tumor returned *with a vengeance*. We went to see the surgeon again and, long story short, he said, \"If it were my dog, I'd just let her go at this point.\" So, as painful as it was, that's what we did. No regrets.\n\nPoint of my story, is you can go through all of it and STILL lose the dog. At 16, your dog has lived a long, full life. When she is no longer happy/comfortable, make the loving decision and let her go.", "16 is like, *the* age for dogs to die. It\u2019s awful your doggo is sick, but putting yourself out $10K is not reasonable. \n\nYour mom seriously needs to stop what she\u2019s doing. Please tell her & don\u2019t let her guilt you.

I\u2019m so sorry your pup is going through this, but given the age and overall diagnosis, it is going to be incredibly distressing to watch your dog get sicker and sicker. I mentioned where I work because you mentioned finances. It is an emergency room, so your dog literally has to have a critical episode. But we don\u2019t separate family and pet. You and your mom will be there every step of the way. If you\u2019d like to know more you can message me. I just want to make sure that you know what could be coming before you even make the decisions. I\u2019m so so sorry", "NTA. I had an 18 year old and had to make the choice to put her down instead of trying to get her help. She was in too much pain and she was too sweet for that. Sometimes you just have to let them go. It\u2019s their time. It\u2019s the hardest thing I ever did but it was for the best.", "Every one dies. Prolonging your dogs life so it can suffer more is not loving it, it's avoiding your own pain at the dogs expense. It's the opposite of loving it.\n\nIf I had cancer and was old AF, I would take an overdose of morphine to send me off any day. That way you get to choose when the end comes, and that that day is a good day surrounded by friends and family", "That's what I was thinking too. Not only will my dog die, but I'll get a bill to remind me of it every month for the next five years. \n\nI'm doing like you said and treating her like a queen on her way out instead. Tonight, I grilled her a whole porkchop. Tomorrow, Ima let her go to town on a rotisserie chicken. Every day is a win from here on out!", "This. I made the wrong choice with one of my old cats and his failed kidneys at 16. He needed fluid injected every day, and he hated it but was too weak to fight. \n\nIt was miserable for both of us and he had to be put to sleep the next month anyway, so instead of going quietly with dignity he fought me and cried and peed on the couch and I had to wrestle him and pin him down long enough for the fluids to get in. \n\nLet her go with dignity. Not necessarily right now, if she's not in discomfort, but don't drag it out and hurt both of you.", "To be fair and fully transparent, she is willing to pay for it. The vets office had a ridiculously expensive contract all printed up and ready to sign that would have had her paying hundreds of dollars a month for years. They kinda made me feel like a prick for talking her down, which is why I'm here.  \n  \nI just know that she 100% cannot afford to do so, and if she did, she'd hang it over my head and use it to guilt me until I paid it off anyway.", "luckily OP isnt like you and realized her mom is seeing her own age and mortality and what will happen to her when she gets sick, and OP has some empathy.\n\nyou do not.", "So very sorry for your loss.\n\nDogs can't absolutely tell us they are ready to leave. Sometimes *we* have to make that terrible decision.\n\nMy 17-year-old Hanshi just kept going and going, being loving and wanting scrubs, even as he became more frail and had a harder time getting around. \n\nI didn't think he wanted to go, realizing now that it was really ***I*** didn't want him to go.\n\nYou should concentrate on all the years of love you gave your Pugger. I'm sure that's what meant the most.", "This. Plus see my post.", "She has a small pension and I provide most of her living costs. I pay almost all her rent and utilities. \n\nShe would absolutely pay if I let her (there was a ridiculous Uplift loan option)  but it would wipe her out and I would indirectly wind up paying for it anyway when she either defaulted or couldn't pay her other bills.", "That's sweet and that's exactly what I think you should do.  A couple of years ago, we had a pet get a bad diagnosis.  We decided that her life was going to be the best we could possibly make it for as long as we could.  She got treats like you wouldn't believe for the next six months or so before she finally passed away.  I'm sure she felt like she won the lottery or something.  I miss her a ton but I am glad that I gave her a ton of happy days and in the last few months she was alive she must have thought she got promoted to queen of the world!  ((HUGS)) to you.  I'm so sorry and you're doing the right thing here.", "Chemo is really hard on people, so I imagine it's just as hard on pets. I know people who opted to not go through chemo because of the wear and tear on the body. It's not fair for the dog to suffer.", ">I'm doing like you said and treating her like a queen on her way out instead.\n\nThis is the way, good for you!", "I was in the same position as you.  I had a cat who I was paying medication for who has becoming dangerously dehydrated because of it.  She was also 18-19 years old.  I stopped giving her the meds because I felt I could not justify extending her life.  I ended up having to euthanise her a two or three months later.\n\nI'm not proud of waiting, honestly.  I should have gone in earlier.  In fact, I did.  But the vet at the time convinced me not to.  That wasn't how I wanted a pet of over a decade to go.\n\nThere's a reason why I don't have a pet and just watch cute cat videos on Youtube.", ">I'm doing like you said and treating her like a queen on her way out instead.

Every day is a win from here on out!\n\nThat's awesome.", "Even if it weren't a financial issue, I think you're doing the right thing for your dog.  I'm questioning the ethics of a veterinary practice that would pressure you into this and hope you consider getting a different vet going forward.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this.", "NTA, because the payment would still fall on you, also the guilt-tripping sounds like something your mom does often, which is fucked up. Sorry that your mom is an asshole, at least in that aspect.", "She needs to attempt to reconcile with the fact that annihilating your finances simply isn't worth saving a 16 year old dog that probably has more health issues coming up that would make it's life unbearable.\n\nEdit: NAH", "She's alright, I think she's just having a hard time with my dog. She IS very attached, and I think she's confronting her own mortality and going through some stuff too, so I can't be too mad at her.

You should be proud that you\u2019re making the mature, clearheaded choice and doing right by your dog by letting them go out peacefully. I\u2019m sorry your mom can\u2019t see that right now.", "Hopefully y'all can talk about this rationally in a bit but don't take too much shit from her. She's saying some very hurtful things that you don't deserve. \n\nIf anything your love for your dog is the best kind of love. Keeping an animal alive when you know the quality of life will be bad is for you, not for them.", "NTA. This phrase really gave me peace in a similar situation: \u201care you prolonging her life, or prolonging her death?\u201d I\u2019m so sorry about your dog, OP. \ud83d\udc94", "NTA. The hardest part of being owned by a pet is end of life. I agree with your decision. If the dog was 3, I probably wouldn\u2019t. 16 years is a good run. Just make sure they don\u2019t suffer needlessly and you\u2019ve done your duty.", "NTA. If you did that treatment, it would be for your own and your mother\u2019s benefit and not for the dog. Your dog is sixteen and even if she survives the surgery, she does not deserve to spend her remaining time ill from chemo and confused at being constantly to and from the vet. Even if all is successful, she\u2019s at the end of her life. Honestly, I\u2019m surprised the vet is even willing to do the treatment. And for the record, all these things would apply even if the treatment was free. \n\nJust treat your girl well and keep her for as long as it\u2019s kind and she\u2019s out of pain, and when the time comes, help her to go peacefully. It\u2019s the last gift we can give - and owe - to the animals we love.", "NTA and I'm saying this with a 16 year old dog who is also medically expensive (but with a manageable condition). You aren't choosing not to save your dog's life, you're making her comfortable and spoiling her rotten after 16 years of companionship and love.\n\nIf you chose the treatment route, there's the risk that her heart may not be able to handle the anaesthesia (very common in older animals). If the surgery went smoothly and it + chemo did cure her cancer, there's a good chance her quality of life would be drastically reduced since those are extremely rough treatments even on younger animals and she probably wouldn't bounce back. She wouldn't be your dog any more, she'd be a husk.\n\nYour mum needs to stop being such a passive aggressive bitch. She's making this about her and her feelings, not what is actually best for your dog, and making an extremely hard, emotional decision even harder for you when she should be supporting and consoling you. I really hope she pulls her head in and realises you aren't making this decision lightly. If anyone  did to me what your mum is doing to you right now, I would never forgive them.", "NTA. Just adding to the chorus. Your mom is hurting, she\u2019s just not at the acceptance stage yet. Do not go into debt for a dog that old. \n\nMy Shih Tzu just turned 14 this past October. She\u2019s 98% blind, going deaf in one ear, likely has some form of early doggie dimentia, and has some incontinence problems. Everything that can be managed is managed with meds. Right now, it seems like every time we take her to the vet (the latest of which being INCREDIBLY stink pee), the vet says something like \u201cwell, despite her current problems, she\u2019s an incredibly healthy old dog\u201d (the pee thing was that she\u2019s under-hydrated, confirmed by urinalysis lol). \n\nI\u2019ve had her since she was 2 months old. She\u2019s my little old Janey. Even writing this my eyes teared up a little bit- but if we got a diagnosis like yours, I wouldn\u2019t do it. I love her to bits, but she is old and has had a really good life, and it just wouldn\u2019t make financial sense. In my opinion, now that you have the knowledge, use it to make a kind end of life plan before her quality of life declines. My plan is to try and go everything I can for her to treat her like a queen leading up to it, and day of just treat her to all her hearts desires (that won\u2019t make her sick) and a really, really good last meal before we say goodbye at home. It\u2019s going to be so hard. But in my opinion it is the right choice.", "NTA. I am in a very similar situation as you. My dog got diagnosed with cancer at 14 and it had already metastasized into other lymph nodes. I also opted against surgery and chemo, not primarily for financial reasons, but because I was worried about his quality of life rather than time we'd gain. So we're are managing his pain and letting him have as good of a rest of his life as we possibly can. It's been over two years now and he's still going reasonably strong (in an old man kind of way) so I think I made the right choice.", "16, and having to go though surgery and chemo doesn\u2019t sound like a fair deal. It sounds like a lot of unnecessary suffering. Maybe if the dog was younger, it would be something to consider in detail. \n\nPalliative care is a perfectly acceptable course of treatment. Manage her pain, and keep her comfortable for as long as it is fair to her. It\u2019s not save the dog at all costs, but give the dog a good quality of life. Sometimes, that\u2019s choosing the above. It\u2019s a choice I\u2019ve seen both sides on.\n\nMy Keeshond, Jonsey, developed stomach cancer. We did surgery and chemo. He only made it 2 months after this. Wasn\u2019t worth it. But I got to say goodbye, and spend the summer with him. Maybe worth it for that. He was 10.5 years. His age was one of the reasons why my dad decided to try. His litter mate brother made it to 15.5. \n\nMy terrier mix, Deenie, got atypical Myxosarcoma in her back right leg in her hip. Right near the femoral artery. The scans we did on her, $2000+ price tag, indicated that the cancer had already possibly spread to her lungs. There were nodules there too. Treatment would have been to remove the leg, and chemo. She was just turning 14 when diagnosed. She also had a heart murmur, though low grade. Wasn\u2019t worth putting her through that. Palliative care gave her 2-6 months. She made it 9 months through sheer grit and determination. She passed in February 2020. And while I still miss her, I don\u2019t regret our decision to go to palliative care for her.\n\nYou know your dog. Give her the best times now. Plenty of love, treats, trips if you can. Send her off as a Queen. And give yourself time to make memories of her. Take pictures and videos.\n\nMy condolences.\n\nNTA.", "NTA the dog is too old for intense medical procedures. Also you said technicaly you can afford it but if it puts you into a huge amount of debt like you say in the OP then no it's not actually affordable either. You can't afford it. The most important thing is not letting her suffer when quality of life is no longer there. You're doing the right thing.", "Letting go is the hardest thing, but the time comes. Last year I had to let our eldest go from cancer, and I waited a bit too long. I too wanted more time, but she suffered longer for it. You are NTA, you are doing what a loving owner does. Prepare now to let her go with no pain. On Daisys last day, I took her out for a last walk around outside, at her pace. Fed her a whole pack of precooked bacon and reeses cups, and we had a vet come to the house. She was in her space, with us, and quietly went to sleep. It was a good as such a thing can be. I miss her terribly even now, but it was time. Give yours that gift of painless crossing. My sympathies.", "NTA My family has been in this position before.   \nTell your mum to pay up if you don\u2019t have a problem with your dog going through this trauma.\n\nYour beautiful pooch won\u2019t understand why she is being hurt and made sick. Giving her a peaceful death is a mercy. Your mother should be ashamed of herself.", "Your dog can't hear what your mother says, so can't be hurt by it.  \n\nWhen we take on animals, we take on responsiblity for them, including the end of their lives in most cases.  That doesn't mean do everything we could do, if that isn't the best for the dog.  Surgery for a dog that will have no idea what is happening to her, will be frightening and there is a good chance she won't survive it, so instead of dying in your arms she might be dying on an operating table.  Sometimes (often) the braveand best thing to do is to be the one that decides 'today is the day'.  Let her go free and not be stuck in corners anymore.  Take some photos and videos so you can keep her memory fresh, then do what you know in your heart is best for her.", "NTA At 16 years your dog has outlived many other dogs. Surgery and chemo is hard on dogs, even for younger ones. It would cause her a lot if pain and discomfort. I have a dog too and it's hard to let them go, but letting them suffer is also not the solution.", "> She thinks no amount is too much to get more time\n\nShe can pay for it all then.

Palliative only. Feels like a cash grab to save a pet that literally can't be saved due to biological life expectations.", "NTA YOU ARE MAKING THE CORRECT CHOICE - your dog may not survive the surgery let alone the follow up chemo.  I wouldn\u2019t even let it happen if mom pays.  Your dog needs you to make the hard yet best choice for them now.  \n\nI was once told to take my dog home for one last weekend and have him put down on Monday (cancer).  Got pain meds for the weekend and it changed my dog completely.  He was eating well and all his symptoms were gone.  Vet said we can keep him medicated until he lets us know he\u2019s ready.   We got an extra 3 months.", "NTA by miles.\n\nMy sweet girl was diagnosed with cancer when she was a year old. The prognosis was good because she was young. But even then, chemo was HELL.

Your dogs quality of life is the most important thing here. It sounds like (and this isn\u2019t your fault obviously) she\u2019s already a very senior dog and in reality sadly doesn\u2019t have a lot of time left as it is. You putting her through unnecessary pain and recovery for surgeries that will impact her even worse because of her being 16, just for her to maybe live in pain for a few months, year or two more is incredibly selfish. I\u2019ve seen countless of people put their senior dogs through surgeries, getting themselves in debt and their dogs die during surgeries or just after. I want to cry at the thought of losing my dog one day but it will inevitably happen one day and you owe it to them to not be selfish and put their welfare before yours. Invest in good pain relief at the vets and make sure she\u2019s living her last moments around family, in peace and relatively pain free. Letting them go when it\u2019s their time is also loving them.", "My elderly dog had cancer last year and the vet advised against chemo because of his age (and other health problems).
