I'm sorry your mom can't see that the most compassionate thing is letting her go when the time comes that her quality of life isn't good anymore.  Its the saddest part of pet ownership, I'm so sorry you're having to experience this.  Please don't beat yourself up, you are making the right call.

She spent thousands on that dog's treatment, and the end result was the same; the dog lived maybe 2-3 additional months, and his quality of live was abysmal.\n\nYour mother's attitude is unfortunate. In the end, she'll hopefully realize that prolonging your dog's pain for her comfort is selfish and cruel.", "NTA, I just put down my 17 year old pug the day after Christmas . He had so many masses. I should have not waited so long.", "NTA. You hear people who go through cancer treatments and they say it\u2019s hell. Your dog may not have much time left. It\u2019s better not to torture her.

I made a similar choice for my dog even though he was only 11, I had watched other animals go through major medical treatments and knew that with everything he needed he would be miserable, in pain, and wouldn't understand also it was SO expensive, like, having a 2nd child or doing treatment that might not even help ( the surgery alone might have killed him ). If I make it to 80+ I probably wouldn't try to treat my cancer either and I am a human. \n\nIt feels hard, but dogs are not supposed to live forever, and keeping them alive and in pain is just something selfish we do for us, not for them.", "NTA, your mom is.  \nThere is always a possibility the treatment won't work as well.

Worse, you might get the surgery and she dies a few days later anyway", "NTA.  I'm sorry your dog has received this diagnosis.  Unfortunately there's no 'saving' any of us from living out our natural lifespan.  Time comes for us all.  Sure, you could bankrupt yourself paying for treatment and she could live an extra few months... but in the end she's still 16 years old.  Her quality of life may not be as good for those months if she's having surgery/treatments.  Your mom is not telling the real story here... this isn't a puppy with a fixable injury who will go on to live years of happy, active life if you ' save' her via medical intervention.  This is an elderly animal who has already lived a good life whose life MIGHT be extended by some months if you 'save' her with a treatment that may not even be effective and may be stressful to her.  \n\nI say you cherish the days with your dog as long as she is comfortable.  Give her treats and love her up and take pictures and make memories.  And when she's no longer enjoying life, let her go.  It's the kindest thing you can do for her, no matter what your mom says.", "NTA.  At her age, there are no guarantees that she would necessarily survive a big surgery and you would still be out a large sum of money.  Pet owners often have to make the hard decision to be able to let their pets go.  It\u2019s heartbreaking but it can be the right decision.  You have given her 16 wonderful years and need to follow your heart.  \n\nCancer treatments can be brutal for any living beings and there are no guarantees for a positive long term outcome.", "NTA you really do love the dog which is why you\u2019re keeping her from months of unnecessary pain. Time to tell your mom she can shut her mouth and enjoy your dog while she\u2019s still here or leave. If she\u2019s not willing to part with $10k then her opinion does not fucking matter and she should not come to your home and say hurtful things.", "NTA At all.  At you dog's age it would probably be cruel to put it through a confusing and painful treatment.  Keep them comfortable and make sure you stay with them and comfort them when they cross over.  Don't feel guilty just love on them more.", "NTA - I am a dog lover and a dog owner. I had to put down my beloved Casey early last year. He was a great dog. Got him as a rescue when he was about 4 and had him for 8 years. He seemed very healthy and energetic.\n\nSuddenly he started having breathing problems. We took him in to the vet and they did an enhanced x-ray and found he had a large mass in his chest that was putting pressure on his heart and lungs -  basically his chest cavity didn't have enough room to expand with his heart and lungs trying to move. Our choice was surgery and followup chemo or putting him down. \n\nWe did research and found that surgery and chemo treatment was usually successful and he would live for 13 more months (on average), IF we did the treatment. So let's see, he would have MAJOR chest surgery followed by 2-3 months of recovery (lots of pain and discomfort) along with 2-3 months of chemo (which would cause more pain and discomfort). All this, which would cost thousands of $, so he could live another 13 months (if successful). \n\nWe put him down before he started suffering. It was a pretty tough time but we have no regrets.", "NTA.  You are not a bad person. It's not just about money, it's about quality of life.  Your dear old pupper is already on the decline from a wonderful life.  That's okay.  She will let you know when she's is ready to go.  \n\nI feel right where you are: there's a good probability that our 9 1/2 yr Staffy (they live to be 10-12) has prostate cancer.  He has spondylosis that may have resulted in nerve damage. He cannot empty his own bladder; we catheterize him twice a day, and he's on a lot of meds while we see if we can reduce the prostate.  And we're not putting him down because on meds, he's still a happy, frisky older dog.  But should it be cancer, we will not opt for surgery, as the survival rate isn't good.", "NTA. It's a very personal decision. It's horrible to have to deny your pet the lifesaving care because it's so expensive. You're in a terrible position, and I'm very sorry for that. Your mom is just making things harder for you.", "NTA, and I'm sorry you're going through this, both the pain of your dog being ill and the guilt.\n\nI was in a similar situation years back with my cat but I opted for the surgery. I took a huge financial hit and he was good for a few more years so I felt like my decision was justified. Until he need another surgery. \n\nEventually he ended up passing and now I have a bit of resentment about the situation, it was a lot of money to spend for a short time of happiness and in reality it was to make me happy, not my cat. Which sounds the same for you, the surgery isn't to help your dog (in the long run) its just to make your mom happy. I almost went with the second surgery because at the time I felt the same as your mom, no amount of money is too much to save this cat, but in the end my mom talked some sense into me and helped me see what the recovery would be like and weighed the pros and cons. All the trips to the vet, the recovery, the meds, the chemo, the stress and anxiety your dog would be going through during that time, is that part really worth it? \n\nIt sounds like your dog has had a long and happy life thanks to you, you've done a great job so far and have nothing to be ashamed of.", "NTA - I'm so sorry, this is such a heartbreaking situation to be in. Like some other commentors have mentioned, your dog has lived a long and happy life, but surgery and cancer treatment is hell and will be incredibly rough on an animal that is already very well into her senior years. Caring for our pets means ensuring that their quality of life is good, not just quantity. Making the best choice for them means letting them go and not prolonging their suffering. \n\nYour mom is a major AH. The things she's saying \"to the dog\" in front of you about you'd do this thing if you loved her, are absolutely vile and cruel. If someone did that to me I would never talk to them again.", "NTA. \n\nMoney aside, putting a 16-year-old dog through that treatment is just cruel. It would not save her, it would *maybe* extend her life a bit. Bit that life would be full of vet trips, medications, pain.\n\nGive her the best days you can and cherish them. \n\nI sympathize with your mom, I do. She is not trying to be an \"asshole\", she is probably just in shock as well. My dog was 12 when she got sick unexpectedly and we had to let her go. They told us we could transfer her to emergency care but she was almost comatose at that point. I couldn't imagine sending her off to some scary, sterile environment where she might spend her last moments. I would've done anything for her, including thousands if dollars (which I'd already spent by that point too) but I couldn't let her suffer just to keep her with me for longer. \n\nYou're doing the right thing, and I'm sorry.", "NTA.  Here's your top concern: what would her quality of life be?  It doesn't sound like it would be a good one.  Keeping animals alive to appease people when the animal will have a poor quality of life is the worst form of animal abuse IMO.  So far I've had to make this difficult decision for three of my dogs.  Do what's best for her.\n\nOn another note \"I can afford it, but it will wipe out my savings and require me to take on a lot of debt to boot.\". We have very different definitions of afford.  If it wipes out your savings and gives you debt that's not affordable in my book.", "NTA and DON'T beat yourself up about this. \n\nI had an elderly dog with cancer. It's not just the money, it's the risk of surgery. My vet told me they'd go ahead if I wanted it, but the chances of even coming out of surgery alive were slim. Surgery on a dog that age is also sure to cause them misery. \n\nYour mother is being cruel, selfish and definitely the AH. Concentrate on giving your pupper the best days, now that the end is close.", "NTA - I am the BIGGEST dog lover in the world and I still think you are making the right decision. You are NOT a monster if you don't do any treatment.\n\nAny treatment you gave this dog would be for YOU and YOUR MOM, not for your dog. I'm honestly surprised your vet is even offering the option. Chemo is usually only offered to younger dogs because they can both handle the treatment (it has side effects, as it does in humans) and there's a significant upside (the dog *could* live many more years).\n\nFWIW, we had a dog who developed a very rare type of cancer (my vet had seen only one other case of it in a 30 year career). We opted for surgery initially - because of the tumor and its location, we had to go to a specialist and it was $$$. But, we wanted to give her a chance. She had the surgery, and while there were some complications, it was ultimately a success...for three months, at which time the tumor returned *with a vengeance*. We went to see the surgeon again and, long story short, he said, \"If it were my dog, I'd just let her go at this point.\" So, as painful as it was, that's what we did. No regrets.\n\nPoint of my story, is you can go through all of it and STILL lose the dog. At 16, your dog has lived a long, full life. When she is no longer happy/comfortable, make the loving decision and let her go.", "16 is like, *the* age for dogs to die. It\u2019s awful your doggo is sick, but putting yourself out $10K is not reasonable. \n\nYour mom seriously needs to stop what she\u2019s doing. Please tell her & don\u2019t let her guilt you.

I\u2019m so sorry your pup is going through this, but given the age and overall diagnosis, it is going to be incredibly distressing to watch your dog get sicker and sicker. I mentioned where I work because you mentioned finances. It is an emergency room, so your dog literally has to have a critical episode. But we don\u2019t separate family and pet. You and your mom will be there every step of the way. If you\u2019d like to know more you can message me. I just want to make sure that you know what could be coming before you even make the decisions. I\u2019m so so sorry", "NTA. I had an 18 year old and had to make the choice to put her down instead of trying to get her help. She was in too much pain and she was too sweet for that. Sometimes you just have to let them go. It\u2019s their time. It\u2019s the hardest thing I ever did but it was for the best.", "Every one dies. Prolonging your dogs life so it can suffer more is not loving it, it's avoiding your own pain at the dogs expense. It's the opposite of loving it.\n\nIf I had cancer and was old AF, I would take an overdose of morphine to send me off any day. That way you get to choose when the end comes, and that that day is a good day surrounded by friends and family", "That's what I was thinking too. Not only will my dog die, but I'll get a bill to remind me of it every month for the next five years. \n\nI'm doing like you said and treating her like a queen on her way out instead. Tonight, I grilled her a whole porkchop. Tomorrow, Ima let her go to town on a rotisserie chicken. Every day is a win from here on out!", "This. I made the wrong choice with one of my old cats and his failed kidneys at 16. He needed fluid injected every day, and he hated it but was too weak to fight. \n\nIt was miserable for both of us and he had to be put to sleep the next month anyway, so instead of going quietly with dignity he fought me and cried and peed on the couch and I had to wrestle him and pin him down long enough for the fluids to get in. \n\nLet her go with dignity. Not necessarily right now, if she's not in discomfort, but don't drag it out and hurt both of you.", "To be fair and fully transparent, she is willing to pay for it. The vets office had a ridiculously expensive contract all printed up and ready to sign that would have had her paying hundreds of dollars a month for years. They kinda made me feel like a prick for talking her down, which is why I'm here.  \n  \nI just know that she 100% cannot afford to do so, and if she did, she'd hang it over my head and use it to guilt me until I paid it off anyway.", "luckily OP isnt like you and realized her mom is seeing her own age and mortality and what will happen to her when she gets sick, and OP has some empathy.\n\nyou do not.", "So very sorry for your loss.\n\nDogs can't absolutely tell us they are ready to leave. Sometimes *we* have to make that terrible decision.\n\nMy 17-year-old Hanshi just kept going and going, being loving and wanting scrubs, even as he became more frail and had a harder time getting around. \n\nI didn't think he wanted to go, realizing now that it was really ***I*** didn't want him to go.\n\nYou should concentrate on all the years of love you gave your Pugger. I'm sure that's what meant the most.", "This. Plus see my post.", "She has a small pension and I provide most of her living costs. I pay almost all her rent and utilities. \n\nShe would absolutely pay if I let her (there was a ridiculous Uplift loan option)  but it would wipe her out and I would indirectly wind up paying for it anyway when she either defaulted or couldn't pay her other bills.", "That's sweet and that's exactly what I think you should do.  A couple of years ago, we had a pet get a bad diagnosis.  We decided that her life was going to be the best we could possibly make it for as long as we could.  She got treats like you wouldn't believe for the next six months or so before she finally passed away.  I'm sure she felt like she won the lottery or something.  I miss her a ton but I am glad that I gave her a ton of happy days and in the last few months she was alive she must have thought she got promoted to queen of the world!  ((HUGS)) to you.  I'm so sorry and you're doing the right thing here.", "Chemo is really hard on people, so I imagine it's just as hard on pets. I know people who opted to not go through chemo because of the wear and tear on the body. It's not fair for the dog to suffer.", ">I'm doing like you said and treating her like a queen on her way out instead.\n\nThis is the way, good for you!", "I was in the same position as you.  I had a cat who I was paying medication for who has becoming dangerously dehydrated because of it.  She was also 18-19 years old.  I stopped giving her the meds because I felt I could not justify extending her life.  I ended up having to euthanise her a two or three months later.\n\nI'm not proud of waiting, honestly.  I should have gone in earlier.  In fact, I did.  But the vet at the time convinced me not to.  That wasn't how I wanted a pet of over a decade to go.\n\nThere's a reason why I don't have a pet and just watch cute cat videos on Youtube.", ">I'm doing like you said and treating her like a queen on her way out instead. Tonight, I grilled her a whole porkchop. Tomorrow, Ima let her go to town on a rotisserie chicken. Every day is a win from here on out!\n\nThat's awesome.", "Even if it weren't a financial issue, I think you're doing the right thing for your dog.  I'm questioning the ethics of a veterinary practice that would pressure you into this and hope you consider getting a different vet going forward.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this.", "NTA, because the payment would still fall on you, also the guilt-tripping sounds like something your mom does often, which is fucked up. Sorry that your mom is an asshole, at least in that aspect.", "She needs to attempt to reconcile with the fact that annihilating your finances simply isn't worth saving a 16 year old dog that probably has more health issues coming up that would make it's life unbearable.\n\nEdit: NAH", "She's alright, I think she's just having a hard time with my dog. She IS very attached, and I think she's confronting her own mortality and going through some stuff too, so I can't be too mad at her. I just don't think she's thinking pragmatically on this one.", "you sound wonderful, your moms not an AH, just dont do this treatment.", "True, it is hard to say goodbye.", "You\u2019re very sweet to give her that benefit of the doubt. You should be proud that you\u2019re making the mature, clearheaded choice and doing right by your dog by letting them go out peacefully. I\u2019m sorry your mom can\u2019t see that right now.", "Hopefully y'all can talk about this rationally in a bit but don't take too much shit from her. She's saying some very hurtful things that you don't deserve. \n\nIf anything your love for your dog is the best kind of love. Keeping an animal alive when you know the quality of life will be bad is for you, not for them."]}
