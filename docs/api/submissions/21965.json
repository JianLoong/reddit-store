If the process of scheduling this trip has taught anything it\u2019s that things don\u2019t go according to plan and sometimes that\u2019s the best you\u2019re gonna get. Anyway, hope you enjoy your trip", "NTA. He asked you change your plans last minute after having already been forced to postpone. Good on you for not caving. Have fun and Enjoy your vacation", "NTA\n\nNothing stopping from going with her later. And nothing stopping from inviting you along, either. People are allowed to go to the same place twice.", "Perfect response. Idiotic young love. Sorry, but once we mature we manage these situations better. Like leaving the new partner behind or it not even it a discussion. Instead \"have a great time, send me photos\"\n\nOP is NTA", "Thank you I will", "Thank you I will", "This, this is the best reference I have ever heard. \ud83d\udc4d", "Thanks, I will. I already went on one trail and had more than enough Radlers", "I just sent him photos of today's hike and then the bar I was in. He sent me a middle finger emoji", "NTA, it's not your problem that he decided he can't go anywhere without her.", "You are NTA.  You are free to travel wherever you like and do whatever you like.  He opted out so his loss but he also can\u2019t whine like a toddler about it either.", "NTA . But you have chosen the best week for hiking... it is incredibly warm. Where are your hiking?", "Turn your phone off.  Don't respond.   Enjoy without his attempt at guilt.", "I was planning a trip abroad with a very good buddy for an event we\u2019re both passionate about. As we\u2019re in the planning stages he mentions that his son is coming too as a graduation treat. I immediately back out and tell him to enjoy the trip with his son. No hard feelings. No worries. \n\nIf \u201cwe\u201d (meaning any two, or three or more people) plan a trip, you don\u2019t invite +1\u2019s. Never. Especially not your new gf on a guys trip. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA. WTF is wrong with him? And is his gf one of those \u201cNot Like Other Girls\u201d? Or is she just oblivious?", "NTA, you don\u2019t have to cancel because he can\u2019t bring his dog oops I mean girlfriend, that\u2019s his problem, not yours", "NTA. You'd be the third wheel on your own vacation. Have fun!", "I was gonna say \"co-dependent\" but I like \"barnacle\" much better!", "I can't remember the last time he went to the toilet without her", "In Bavaria, hottest I saw today was 33\u00b0 with some breeze so it wasn't too bad. Just got to make sure I got Radlers and water.", "Lmao thats perfect, dont rub it in too hard though. Talk about misplaced anger. He\u2019s mad that his girlfriend is forcing him to miss out on a great experience so he wants you to miss out on it too? all to save himself from having abit of FOMO.  \n\nIf this keeps happening He\u2019s gonna find out real quick that every time it does the event doesnt get canceled, he just gets a uninvited and misses out. If he doesnt want to miss out, sack up or pack up buddy.", "LOL! thanks for telling us that.", "He sucks.  NTA", "I'll try not to. The only problem is we both work for my grandpa and he's gonna want all the details. Also knowing my grandpa he'll tease the shit out of my cousin for not going because of his gf.", "Nta", "NTA.. she was not a part of this trip. They are both AH", "NTA. you have had these plans for years. The trip was all scheduled and ready to go but he didn't want to go. That doesn't mean you cannot go.  I would tell him you are sorry he is upset but he chose to stay home. Maybe block him during the trip. \n\nHave a great time!!", "no comments on your situation but just wanted to give you kudos for being the first \"pm_me\" username I've seen in a while that is just as random as mine haha", "He's not missing because his girlfriend forced him to. He's choosing not to go because he can not disconnect himself from her for a few weeks to go on a trip he coordinated before they met and now he is jealous. If he is going to he that guy, his social calendar is going to dwindle fast.", "As he should lol.", "That makes it perfect.  The common phrase used by people of my age for this situation was p\\*ssy-wh\\*pped.  Don't know if allowed to use that term but do let me know if grandpa uses it please.  Are you and the other cousins making bets on how long this relationship will last yet?", "\\*whip snapping sound\\* a la Big Bang Theory", "NTA. I'd vote for your cousin as the AH. Is the GF even into hiking?", "NTA. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong. You planned a trip with your cousin, and HE changed his mind because of his gf. That\u2019s his choice, but he doesn\u2019t get to make the choice for you.", "NTA. Nope. He wasn\u2019t strong enough to stand up and say I\u2019m sorry. We planned this 2 years ago. We are going but I\u2019m the future. I\u2019ll take you!", "NTA  \nYour cousin is ridiculous and if he can't spend a week away from his GF he's a pretty sad character.", "He tried to get you to cancel and give your place to his gf, why should you feel bad that you went and decided not to go to stay with his gf? He got what he wanted, time with his gf. Tell him to get over it.", "NTA\n\nShe isn\u2019t making him do anything. He agreed to miss out on this trip and isn\u2019t taking responsibility for his choice.", "A bit of both plus she took his virginity.", "Funny you mention that, she's a coyote furry", "Thank you I will", "We took her once on a trail in Donegal. Ill prepared and complained the whole time", "Considering she took his virginity I don't think he'll be standing up to her soon", "It's his first girlfriend so I think that may play into it", "I live in Colorado.  When you said Radlers I thought you were saying \"Rattlers\" as in rattle snakes.  They are all over the place here and hikers need to be careful.  \n\nNow I want to try a Radler.", "How long have they been together?", "I think it's good but keep in mind it's a pilsner so you're gonna piss like crazy if you watch it.", "4 months", "Yeah you don't see a whole lot of our style usernames anymore. We're the last of the Mohicans", "Actually, me and grandpa have a \u20ac100 wager going right now. I reckon at least a year since she took his virginity, he thinks less than 6 months. Another 2 months and I'll win.", "NTA have fun!", "Definitely NTA.  She would have wanted him to go with her sightseeing.  Not you.  She would have wanted meals just them. Not you.  She would have wanted side trips with Not you.", "NTA - his GF does not dictate your plans. Your plans don not revolve around HIS GF", "No you don't. You know you handled it just right. NTA if just for your edit and the middle finger emoji producing text...\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Ein Prosit (beer and countryside photo tax, bitte?)", "Right! Plus adding in a girlfriend, no matter what she is like, would completely change the dynamic of the trip. Why would OP want to go if he just ends up being the third wheel?", "Thanks", "I figured I would have flown solo if she came. I was actually starting to worry how the car rental would go since we only booked one, and chances were likely they'd take off. Then there's the hotel issue, not saying I would but I know there'd be hell if I brought a girl back.", "I'll see if I can get a good picture. No promises, though", "Photo tax, bitte?", "Radler=shandy", "Sack up or pack up...Brilliant!", "If he went, he would know and not need to ask.", "I meant my grandpa will want the details", "NTA", "NTA, you will have a great time without him and the new GF.  If they can I can only imagine the nightmare this trip would be for you.  You would be a third wheel on a couple's trip. He can take his girlfriend on his own.  Just wondering where you going to share a hotel room on with him on the trip?", "We were going to share a room, so I'd imagine we'd end up booking another room so they could have privacy.", "Do people send you a lot of teeth pics? I feel like I never notice usenames unless a comment points them out.", "well-deserved teasing.", "NTA, not at all. What a joker, telling you to cancel your holiday.", "What does that mean?", "Or you would come in a night and find yourself locked out of your room.", "She likes to dress up like a coyote", "That would suck. I would probably hire a couple hookers to come play strip poker and leave the door unlocked if they did that.", "nta", "NTA - he wants to go but he doesn't want to leave the gf behind him.  Is she necessary for his survival?  Does she provide medical support? Does he expect you all to share the same bed? \n\nThere is no doubt the gf will grumble the whole time and ruin the holiday.\n\nEnjoy Germany solo !", "That\u2019s so funny \n\nUsually I don\u2019t really care if people are furries but this is so ironic", "The whole thing just got better. Maybe she wanted to dress up on the trip and give you guys an IRL zoo experience on the trail!", "His gf is a bit toxic as they are NOT attached at the hip and there will be occasions where they need to do trips solo. \nThis was one of them, planned years before he met her.
