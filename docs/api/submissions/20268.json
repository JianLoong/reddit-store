Why was she so annoyed that you were \"lazy\"? It's not like you are either her employee or her child, so who cares?\n\nNTA. And I strongly suspect that this is par for the course with this woman. Look at the evidence: the groom avoided explaining the joke to his mother (probably hoping that she'd take it better coming from a stranger, rather than berating him or his bride for being lazy), and your friend assured you that you weren't a problem.", "Based on the title, I was not expecting to say NTA.

It was a tiny inside joke that doesn\u2019t even mean anything, and you were green lighted to say it", "NTA. MIL is ridiculous. As long as you okayed it with the bride, your friend, and she found it hilarious, then you were all good", "NTA be prepared that you're going to spend the next few decades commiserating with your friend about their MIL, can't imagine this is a one off", "NTA - She didn't get that you were joking, got mad, and decided that she'd rather be mad and critical than admit she had rushed to judgment.", "NTA,\n\nLet it go. Not worth you\u2019re time. Bride approved it, it\u2019s her wedding. The feelings of the other invitees are irrelevant", "NTA \n\nBlow it off. Your friend's mom didn't get it and maybe she never will. Hopefully, someone will clue her in and she'll feel bad about how she acted.", "NTA she is too lazy to understand the joke.", "WTF??? How is this even remotely offensive or an issue?? You told her a couple times that it was you who wrote it and it was just a joke. NTA and don't worry about her.

She needs to grow up and get over herself", "NTA-Frankly, I\u2019d say you likely did the bit well enough that it provided too much levity for JUSTNOMIL\u2019s comfort level. Makes it harder for the spotlight to stay on her.", "NTA but did the grooms mom already know about it by the time you talked to her? Because it sounds like she did. I think the groom may be TA. He should have at least walked up and introduced you personally and been there to mitigate his mother", "NTA- they just don\u2019t get it. \npersonally, i really liked the joke and i would\u2019ve laughed at the wedding.", "Ok boomer /s", "NTA. And I think the groom is kind of the AH for pawning off his crazy mom on you instead of handling it himself.", "NTA.

The MIL is one of those people you can't rationalize with, so don't try.  I've learned the best replay is just to stare at them while smiling, then nod your head and go uh huh...", "NTA, and also not an offensive joke. This lady needs to chill. It sounds like she really just isn\u2019t happy with the wedding and your friend, and just used you as an excuse to lose her shit. I had an inlaw like that. It\u2019s just passive aggressive and rude. Just be glad she\u2019s not your MIL!!", "Seriously, I was bracing myself for some serious racism \ud83d\ude02.

The grooms mother was clueless & obviously the groom was as well. Otherwise the joke wouldn\u2019t have needed to be explained. Especially by you. \n\nThe groom didn\u2019t even bring it to his wife, the bride, but automatically wanted you to apologize/explain to his mom. \n\nGroom is a mamas boy who didn\u2019t even talk to his new wife about it. Your friend is going to have huge mommy issues with her now husband. \n\nNTA. I doubt this marriage will last long. Please be there for your friend.", "Why did husband ask you to explain? MIL clearly knows what chatgpt is. \n\nHe should have reeled her in, and you shluld not have been responsible for this. This is ridiculous. \n\nNTA", "Clearly MIL just doesn't like your friend and was trying hard to look any excuse for it. I bet she even knows it was a joke, but she'll still die on that hill only to upset your friend \n\nNTA", "NTA. Stay miles away from thru groom's mom, though. Sheesh.", "Your last paragraph is spot on. This woman is a JNMIL who hasn't been blocked yet. She's looking for reasons to blame her new DIL for stealing her son.", "You were just in the firing line.", "NTA but I feel bad for your friend, her MIL sounds exhausting AF", "NTA it sounds like MIL was just looking for a reason to pick on her DIL. She was just using you as an excuse.", "NTA just sounds like MIL is trying to score points against the bride 'See son she's lazy, just like her friends!'", "She doesn\u2019t want to get the joke, as she seems to be grasping at anything that could justify -in her mind- badmouthing her DIL.", "This is my new favorite AITA post lmao", "NTA - this woman is silly.  If you think something is off colour about the speeches, you don't point it out, particularly to the bride.  If you don't get the joke - move on\n\nI suspect the MIL had her nose out of joint for another reason and deliberately created drama.  You were just caught in the whirlwind of ' this woman has stolen my son' emotions", "NTA.  Your friend has a MIL problem, and I guarantee it predates your speech.  It sounds very much like her MIL does not approve of her working in the male-dominated tech field.", "I love your second paragraph!!\nSo fucking true", "NTA \n\neven if written by AI you hopefully would have read and corrected it before presenting it at the wedding\n\nAI is a tool you can use it."]}
