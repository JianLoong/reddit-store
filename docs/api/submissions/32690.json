This is a conflict primarily between myself and my wife although Katie has recently tried to get involved.\n\nBasically, Lila has a sister with a 16 year old girl. They used to live halfway across the country, so we never really saw them, but very recently they have moved back closer to us. After the move, Lila's niece decided to do a closet clean out and has a few trash bags full of clothes that are too small/that she doesn't like. Lila's sister offered to give them to our daughter.\n\nLila was all for it and I said absolutely not. We grew up very differently. My parents would never have thought to put me in other people's cast offs. According to my wife, most of her clothes were 'hand me downs' from cousins/sisters growing up, but I also know that they were lower class. I have a good job and we do well for our family. We can very much afford to buy our daughter new clothes. Plus, though I didn't tell my Lila this, her folks (especially her sister's family) are kind of trashy. I really don't want my kid wearing the things that my wife's niece would have.\n\nMy wife is calling me stuck up. I think I am being pragmatic. Those clothes can go to goodwill if they really want to do some good, not to a kid with parents that can buy her anything she wants. Katie caught us arguing about it and she took her mothers side, much to my chagrin. She says that she thinks her cousin is \"super cool\" and that it would be like bonding to wear her clothes. This worries me even more because Katie does not need to be emulating her cousin.

They all have exchanged clothes and hand me downs regularly go between families for younger siblings of the girls.  \n\nIt is not because of the money.  It is not because someone is poor.  \n\n1. It is part of their social conscience.  Their generation is quite proud of reusing rather than disposing.\n2. They get decent clothes and are learning how to budget, put together an outfit, mix and match accessories.\n3. They have fun together looking for items that go with their current wardrobe.", "YTA dude. Your entire post comes across as incredibly classist. Are you ashamed of your wife and how she grew up? I also find it interesting that you feel like you have complete veto power over this when it\u2019s involving your wife, her family and your daughter, and all of them are good with it. It is such a small thing that even if it makes you a little bit uncomfortable (oooh sharing clothes), you can and should suck it up. I really doubt that your niece\u2019s clothes are that egregious.", "YTA. \n\nYour kid is not going to die because she has hand-me-downs and not brand new clothing. No one will think less of her or even know where she got the clothes.  And guess what? Her generation is more into thrifting and sharing clothing than they are buying brand new because they understand the impact of fast fashion. You sound like a snob. \n\nBTW, they aren't cast-offs or unwanted items, they are too small. They will get good use through your daughter. If anything is particularly objectionable, then go through it with your daughter and explain to her why you find the item to be a problem.", "YTA.\n\nWealthy people wear hand me downs all the time. They just call it vintage.\n\nThe only people I know who have your attitude are people so insecure about their status that they feel they need to be completely independent to prove a point.", "There is nothing pragmatic about teaching your kid to think of herself as too good for secondhand goods. You are not being honest about the economy today's kids are inheriting.\n\nThe ugly reality is, unless you are wealthy and can get Katie set up for life, she's probably going to have to experience buying things secondhand. There's absolutely nothing wrong with secondhand clothes. \n\nAlso, if there is something you don't approve of about the cousin, you need to figure out how to address it directly. Simply trying to discourage the relationship between your daughter and her cousin is not likely to work; she's just going to perceive it as controlling (which it is). YTA.", "YTA.

My people came from money like yours and as the youngest, my school clothes had been bought at the best stores so they'd last, worn by three sisters, sent out to two cousins in the Midwest, and then given to me to wear, and none of it mattered, because we were being raised to value our brains, kindness, and work ethics, not how we looked.  You know, to be modern women, not needing to depend on some man to provide our clothes and then tell us which ones we can and cannot wear. It's been a while since that's the way things were done fashion-wise, but the core value of not caring one fig about what people think about your clothes, or caring more about who other people are than how much money they have or what they're wearing, are still far better values than your shallow and narcissistic power moves.

Also, could you please take a step back from judging the cousin and family for being trashy? You're assholery is hanging out all over the place. I'm sure the cousin's parents have to worry about their daughter being shit on by their elitest uncle and they might be afraid she'll learn to be selfish, self-aggrandizing, judgmental, and condescending from Katie.

Mom had to explain that these were expensive clothes, kids outgrow stuff, and this way the clothes kept getting used.

This is a conflict primarily between myself and my wife although Katie has recently tried to get involved.\n\nBasically, Lila has a sister with a 16 year old girl. They used to live halfway across the country, so we never really saw them, but very recently they have moved back closer to us. After the move, Lila's niece decided to do a closet clean out and has a few trash bags full of clothes that are too small/that she doesn't like. Lila's sister offered to give them to our daughter.\n\nLila was all for it and I said absolutely not. We grew up very differently. My parents would never have thought to put me in other people's cast offs. According to my wife, most of her clothes were 'hand me downs' from cousins/sisters growing up, but I also know that they were lower class. I have a good job and we do well for our family. We can very much afford to buy our daughter new clothes. Plus, though I didn't tell my Lila this, her folks (especially her sister's family) are kind of trashy. I really don't want my kid wearing the things that my wife's niece would have.\n\nMy wife is calling me stuck up. I think I am being pragmatic. Those clothes can go to goodwill if they really want to do some good, not to a kid with parents that can buy her anything she wants. Katie caught us arguing about it and she took her mothers side, much to my chagrin. She says that she thinks her cousin is \"super cool\" and that it would be like bonding to wear her clothes. This worries me even more because Katie does not need to be emulating her cousin. Am I being the asshole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Especially after your daughter spoke up and said she likes her cousins clothes. The only wrong thing about hand me downs is if they're being forced onto you, which they aren't.

Do not take the entire bag home with you - tell the donor getting rid of the clothes you don't use is a responsibility you don't want to worry about.\n\nIf possible, give your daughter a private space to pick through and try on the clothing away from the donor. So many times I had to just say \"yes\" because the person was watching, or they'd say something like \"omg I loved that shirt, it will look so cute on you\" and I'd feel obligated to take it even if I hate it.\n\nDon't feel bad about handing back every piece if they aren't suitable. \n\nMy oldest daughter has her own style and never took hand me downs, but loves thrifting now. My middle daughter has received a lot of clothes from my stepsister and niece that were really cute, in style, and well cared for that she really loves. Even though we could absolutely afford clothes for her, there was stuff that we couldn't have afforded and stuff we wouldn't have even seen.\n\nPoint is, you don't have to knock it before you try it.
