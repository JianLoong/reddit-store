That said, i would never dream of asking to bring my dog over unless it were my parents, or a friend who invited my dog over with me (i have one friend who loves dogs and loves the additional company).\n\nYou are right to stand your ground and there is nothing wrong with denying his request. Even if the dog were clean and well behaved, it is your house and your choice to not have another dog at your home. If your friend doesn't respect that, then some immediate options i see are....\n\n1. Go to your friend's house? I have a friend who loves to hang for the full day. On days i can't get a dog sitter i will invite my friend over instead (we game) and it isn't a problem.\n\n2. Shorten the visit duration. Hang for a lil bit and that is that.(without the dog)\n\n3. Don't hang out.\n\n\nI am sure there are many other possibilities, but your decision is just that, and your friend must respect that.
