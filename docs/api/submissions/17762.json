I prepared all the divorce documents myself. He insisted on having his lawyer look over them. His lawyer literally changed nothing. In our divorce agreement I\u2019ve put forth an amount for child support that I felt was low for me but at the same time I didn\u2019t want to screw him over. None of this child support was done through the courts other than registering it as a document of the courts.\n\nAccording to our agreement, he pays me CS each month for the 3 kids. Anything that is above and beyond \u201cnormal expenses\u201d like camps and back to school supplies for field trips is supposed to be paid 50-50. He handles any medical expenses but my children qualify for government assistance because of different qualifying disabilities so he doesn\u2019t have to pay for insurance other than some co-pays here and there, mostly for vision or dental.\n\nSoon after the divorce, he got a better paying job. He now makes $40k more than when we signed the agreement, and his salary is more than double mine. I never asked him to pay more or revisit our agreement. \n\nLast year our rent went up by 25% which is an extra $500. I was able to talk the landlord down to a $400 increase. I swallowed my pride and asked my ex to increase his support to by $200 in order to help cover half the costs. He said he couldn\u2019t afford it but would offer me 100 extra month. Okay. Fine. I\u2019ll take what I can get.\n\nHe\u2019s never been a great communicator, but the past year, his communication has gone WAY downhill.  All of my communication goes on answered anytime I asks about him paying for kids expenses.\n\nI\u2019ve often struggled to make ends meet.  Since the beginning of the school year, he has left almost $400 of his portion of extra expenses unpaid. I have repeatedly asked him for these payments, and eventually just gave up.\n\nMy oldest son just got his drivers license with the support of both me and his father. \n\nIn my state if you do not register that new driver on your insurance within 30 days of getting their drivers license, you get a fine. I knew my drivers insurance would go up but it more than doubled. And I am required to put him on my insurance or his own insurance at the place where he lives so I can\u2019t insist he go on his dad\u2019s.\n\nThere\u2019s no work around. It\u2019s an extra $150 a month. I\u2019ve asked his dad several times if he would contribute $75 a month for this expense. He\u2019s answered every other question. I\u2019ve asked him in the past three weeks except for that one. I\u2019m tired of running around and having to wait For him to decide if he wants to give me the money he owes me. \n\nI want to file officially for child support in court. The thing is\u2026 I was super generous with the amount that I requested. If I take him to court, he would owe me $400-600 a month more in child support.\n\nI know that this is going to cause him to likely fly off the handle with me and sever any tenuous fa\u00e7ade of being on good terms.\n\nEdit: before anyone asks why my kid doesn\u2019t pay for their own insurance\u2026 It\u2019s not that I\u2019m opposed to that, but my kid works really hard in school, \u2026is a straight \u201cA\u201d student and a student athlete. \n\nHe would have a hard time maintaining that and working during the school year. He\u2019s absolutely looking for a summer job and has worked in the past\n\n Before my son got his drivers license, his father and I discussed about the fact that my insurance bill would go up and I had asked about splitting the cost. He never answered so I went with the idea that silence is agreement.\n\nEdit 2: I will say in my ex\u2019s defense he has never once been late on the agreed-upon child support. It\u2019s the extra expenses that I\u2019ve been having a hard time getting him to pay.", "created_utc": 1684598467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13myqb3/wibta_to_take_my_ex_to_child_support_court_over/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds to me like the original child support agreement was to your ex\u2019s advantage 5 years ago and that was why his lawyer didn\u2019t change a thing. This time around you need to have a lawyer.  Check your state\u2019s child support guidelines for info on how much he should have been paying all along. Have a vomit bag nearby.", "NTA. First your ex was actually smart to have a lawyer to take a look at your original agreement you should have done the same. You should have also had the court legally determine the amount that would have probably avoided all the struggling you have been doing to make ends meet. Your ex should be paying his fair share to support the children that you both brought into this world.

This hardship is on your children as much as it is on you. His reaction to supporting HIS OWN CHILDREN is his own responsibility. \n\nI did exactly what you did: I prepared all of the paperwork for our divorce, asked for about half of what the calculators said we were entitled to, and didn't ask for an increase, even when he doubled his income. We struggled. I couldn't get a better job because I was spending so much of my time caring for our special needs child. Long story short, I should have gone back to court. I should have gotten what he owed our daughter. The money was not for me, it was for her. His reaction is not your responsibility.", "NTA - how your ex will react when being asked to be a father to his kids is not your problem. Your children's needs come before your ex's lifestyle.", "NTA.\n\n That money belongs to your children.", "NTA\n\nWhen you are struggling, go for as much as possible.

Why are you struggling with your children's expenses? Your children deserve the proper level of support from their father.", "YTA for NOT taking him back to court already.  Child support is for the kids.  To not fight for them to have what they need and to live a better life with that money is WRONG.", "Child support is your children's entitlement, not yours. You both were Y T A for deciding to shortchange the kids with the original agreement. Now your ex is not even covering all of what little he agreed to in that contract. Go to court. The kids deserve your advocacy on this, and always did. NTA.", "NTA\n\nContact an attorney ASAP. Many attorneys will give you a free consultation, with one or two outcomes: hoping you will take their firm, or tell you that you don't actually NEED an attorney and will tell you how to go about the paperwork and wish you good luck. \n\nMany will put aside fees, if they think you are owed back support (especially if your ex was not completely honest about his raises while under that contract) in lieu of getting a percentage of what you are awarded. (can be up to forty percent if it's a large settlement) This can be to your advantage in some cases. \n\nIf nothing else, an attorney can tell you what paperwork to file, to get you started on your way.\n\nedited to add: Since he is refusing to discuss the financials with you, do NOT discuss this with him verbally. Either take voicemails from your ex, or emails or texts as they can be admissible in court. Good luck.", "NTA. He's living high on the hog while you struggle to make ends meet caring for these kids?
