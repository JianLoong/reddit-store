They're going to have to reach out to you in someway and let you know that their attitude has changed. If that's not realistic? You're under no obligation to go there ever again.", "NTA.  When Alejandro's father reaches out to you, apologizes to you, and warmly invites you to his home, you can go.   (You might have to follow to weather report to see when the next cold day in Hell is predicted, though, as that's when you can expect said apology and invitation.  I hope I'm wrong, but with the level of homophobia and hostility you've described, probably not.)", "NTA. He didn't make an effort to apologize to you, as being married you are one.", "NTA. Where\u2019s your apology? Just because they\u2019ve made up doesn\u2019t mean you are obliged to forgive him or try again. He made his bed.", "NTA", "Would it make a difference if you got a sincere apology from his dad?  If so, it\u2019s worth pointing out to your husband that while his dad apologized to him, he still hasn\u2019t apologized to you, and that\u2019s necessary before you can even think about taking another stab at building a relationship.\n\nIt\u2019s okay if the answer to that question is no - you don\u2019t have to be willing to give him another chance, with how he has treated you.\n\nIt\u2019s also okay if you want to have some lower stakes meet-ups some time in the new year and you\u2019ll consider next Christmas as a possibility if they go well.  Christmas is a stressful day even with the most convivial family, so it\u2019s completely reasonable to want to have a few harmonious gatherings under your belt before the big holiday.\n\nNTA", "NTA for not wanting to re-enter what has been a consistently hostile atmosphere. I wouldn't blame you for sticking to your guns and not visiting. However, there is a possible opportunity here for change and a better future if you do visit. If your partner has made up with his father, that means he's going to be a part of his life for the foreseeable future(you're both in your 20s) and you avoiding him is just going to be a continuous source of contention in your relationship. Moreover, if the father apologized to your partner, there may be an apology waiting for you. \n\nIt's not an easy thing to change a lifetime of belief and values, and if the father is willing to make that change, it would be big of you to help him move forward. Not an easy thing by any stretch of the imagination, but worthy things are rarely easy and in the long-term, it might be the right thing to do.", "NTA You didn't get an apology for how you were treated. Also how can one be sure you would be treated with respect if you go there, your FIL might end up acting the same if not worse.", "FIL deserves nothing from you.  But your husband does.  If he believes his father has truly changed his tune, maybe going this year would give him the opportunity to apologize?  For your husband, it might be worth giving him one more chance?  No judgment here either way.", "NTA. THEY made up. Apologies are still in order from his father to you.", "NTA. I don\u2019t blame you it\u2019s toxic and it\u2019s abuse.", "NTA, and I'm so sorry you are stuck in this situation.", "Hi holidaythrowaway098. You're clearly NTA here, and I can absolutely feel the fear and disgust about having to face a person who has treated your own person(hood) with contempt.  Although it sounds like some things have been smoothed over by your hubs, the fear of disappointment is real.  \n\nYou can choose to give it one more go, make a deal with your other half that this is your last shot.  Or not, and go directly to your family and meet up later.  The stress is real, it has precedent. But if you think it's worth one more try, after all your efforts, this would be the time to give a relationship with your Da' in law one more shot.  Either way, I hope you both have a most magnificent holiday!", "NTA, but consider that your husband feels his father is trying to make amends. Your husband will WANT his family to finally have a good relationship with you. Maybe consider offering to go there for a few hours, maybe just for a lunch or dinner?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think it was very kind of you to encourage your husband to see his fam in spite of everything. However it is 100% valid for you to not want to visit a family that mistreated you. Also, I feel like any holiday is too important to test out if his family is going to mistreat you again or not..", "NTA /he didn\u2019t apologize to you.", "NTA. I\u2019m hopeful that you\u2019ll get an apology and that your FIL comes around eventually, and that you\u2019ll be able to visit his family comfortably in the future.

Nah stick to your original plan!", "Personally I'd tell your husband that you will go,  but if nothing has changed then this will be the end of trying.\nYou will not be made to feel like your doing something wrong, by just being who you are and made to feel worthless for for for and loving your hubby.", "NTA based on many interactions, I wouldn't want to be around your FIL.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry that either of you have to deal with this.\n\nThe hubs has to stand up for you (because marriage), and when confronted with his family\u2019s attitudes, he\u2019s not yet up to the job. He should at least acknowledge as much and let you stay out of the way.\n\nAlso, he\u2019s putting himself in a nasty situation that probably will not end well. I don\u2019t see dear old Dad having any sudden epiphanies, y\u2019know?", "NTA Dad apologized to his son but never to you. If he wants to apologize, he can invite you over for a drink before the holiday.", "And I would add that we should be very clear- This Olive branch should not be extended over a Christmas dinner, it should be on neutral turf and on a non special day where there's pressure to behave, demure, or conform. It sounds like DH is ready to lay down arms because he misses his family and wants their happiness, but perhaps at cost of his husband's.\n\nEdit to say: and, while OP's husband may not like to hear it, it's also entirely possible that his father works up to apologizing and OP accepts or doesn't accept it, and also isn't willing to go to family events after this having been an unsafe and unwelcoming space, also entirely his right.", "There is absolutely no reason for OP to spend one minute with a person like that. He has offered a reasonable compromise. If husband is willing to overlook his father's past cruelty that's on him but he has no right to ask OP to accept it.", "NTA", "NTA.

It was a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nIt sounds like the man has had a change of hear and would like to start over.  I know its not fair asking the LGBTQ people to do all the moving but your husband hopes you might see a different side of his father.  \n\nYou were perhaps luckier in your parents", "NTA\n\nWhile Dad and he have come to a better place, his father has never apologized to you. \n\nThere is also no guarantee that while he has \"accepted\" his son for who he is, that he will behave any differently to you.", "So, your husband got an apology and you didn't?\n\nNTA\n\n\" I\u2019ve suggested that we both go to our respective families and then meet up at my parent\u2019s house for Christmas.\"\n\nStick to the plan.
