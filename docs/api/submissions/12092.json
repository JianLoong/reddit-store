Apparently, this other guy did too. The job is simple: watch cameras in an office all night to make sure no one breaks in. With the building we were protecting, I was 100% sure no one was gonna break in (which I was right about). However it was a 5 day contract so I decided to take it for some cash.\n\nSo, it\u2019s night one, and this other guys is getting really irritated that all he has to do is sit in an office and (basically) not do anything. I\u2019m a really quiet and introverted person, so I just played chess on my phone. Then he just randomly says:\n\n\u201cHey, if I sleep for 2 hours, and you watch, I\u2019ll let you sleep for 2 hours and I\u2019ll watch.\u201d \n\nNow, the shift is 12 hours, so I feel like any normal person with a partner would do this, and I might have too but I don\u2019t trust anyone enough to sleep next to them. I just say \u201cok\u201d and let him do his thing, and sure enough about 10 minutes later he is out cold.\n\nIt was around this moment that I got a gut feeling that something was wrong or going to happen, and my gut told me to take a photo of him with the clock perfectly in the background, so I did. \n\nSure enough he sleeps for 2 hours and wakes up when I come back from the bathroom. We trade places, but I fake sleep. I close my eyes just enough where it looks like I\u2019m asleep when I\u2019m awake, and this motherfucker takes a picture of me \u201casleep\u201d. I don\u2019t say anything and \u201cfake wake up\u201d and stay awake for the remainder of the shift. \n\nWe get off work, and I go home and actually sleep, and then when I wake up I got 2 missed calls from my boss and 5 texts. I call him back, and he tells me to come by the office immediately. So I get my ass out of bed and go to the office and sure fucking enough, my co worker tried to use that photo of me fake sleeping to get me fired.\n\nNow, I have never met this kid, never heard anything about him, or anything, so why he had a vendetta against me I had no idea. I calmly explained what happened to my boss, and pulled out my phone with MY picture oh him sleeping. At this point, my boss laughed and told me I would be working the office alone.\n\nJust found out about 2 hours ago the kid lost his job and now he is calling my work phone from his personal phone sending me death threats.

Nowadays you can't let shit like that go undocumented.  He may be blowing off steam in an inappropriate manner, but he could also be planning on blowing your head off.  NTA. You didn't get him fired. You needed to do it so you did not get fired.  He brought it on himself.", "I have no idea what his vendetta was. I have worked with several people on 12-24 hour contracts and if they ask if they can sleep (or just fall asleep) I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m a punk ass kid with energy and half the people I work with are adults with kids, so they need the sleep. Something was just off about him.", "The death threat situation is being handled by my boss. I have zero self esteem or social skills so I am quite literally incapable of helping myself with police.

However I can see your point about just doing my job", "Not an arrangement and management has fired people in the past for it.

That\u2019s why I specifically made sure to also get the clock (it shows time, day, and month cause digital) in the photo as well. Just a weird instinct but I can see the argument of hypocrisy", "You're really lucky your gut warned you about him, you really didn't do anything wrong here.", "Do not believe your boss. This smells strange. The police should be talking to you, not him.", ">which led to him trying to get me fired\n\nNo, this didn't led to him do it. He planned to do it from the start. This is completely and 100% on him. It was his decision to do that. And only his. He got himself fired, because he started this. And he had full control over the situation, he could have just... not tried to get you fired and everything would be fine. He was the one suggesting you two watch out for each other. And you got a bad feeling for a reason. And that is that he planned this. He made you agreed to the deal, he set you up. So it was him and his actions that forced you to react and defend yourself by showing that foto. No one forced him to do so at first. There was absolutely no reason to it, nothing bad would have happened if he didn't try to get you fired. \n\nSo NTA. Definitely NTA.\n\nHe's the perfect example of play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "But he brought up the idea of sleeping on the job.", "I dont see a problem with the sleeping, 12 hours is long. And as long as you have every camera point in view, its fine imo.\n\nDont feel bad about him, for sure thats not the first time he pulled something like this. And he brought up the sleeping to screw you over", "I can't. You had a gut feeling. That guy was being a dick. There is no hypocrisy here. It would be one thing if he hadn't set you up. But he did. And it was premeditated.", "I know he brought it up but I didn\u2019t shut it down and instead just \u201cplayed along\u201d."]}
