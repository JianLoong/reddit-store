They asked if they could change their address to ours because they said they needed an address in the US because they are still US citizens and need a US address, I believe. We didn't think much of it at the time and were told it would be temporary so we agreed.\n\nEver since then, our mailbox has been flooded with their mail - probably 80-90% of our mail is addressed to them (it's insane how much spam mail are directed at retirees). We'd just set all mail aside, but when we told them how much we were getting, they remarked that we could open up their mail and throw away the spam and hang onto the important ones and they wouldn't mind. However, this takes much more effort because now we have to open each one and make the decision if it's important or not. Every now and again, they'd say an urgent mail is coming (new credit card, insurance, taxes, small package, etc) and ask us to send that and any other mail to another relative or friend of theirs who are planning to visit them. So we'd have to pay to ship a box of mail to that other person. Otherwise we'd give it to them when they visit.\n\nThey now visit our house 3 or 4 time a year for usually 1-2 weeks at a time to do things such as meet with tax advisors, go to medical appointments, etc. Every time before they visit, we start receiving amazon packages seeming every couple of days starting a few month prior to their visit for us to hang on to for items for them to take back to Costa Rica. This time for their current visit, the amount of packages took up the entire space under our guest bed. When I told them there was so much, they said \"Thanks for letting us know that we need to bring two suitcases\". We're two working professionals who are also getting graduate degrees who don't have a lot of time to sort mail, go to the post office to drop things off and we are tired.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I told them that we need them to change their address away from ours and stop sending packages to our house because we can't be their storage unit? Maybe have them send it to my aunt (dad's sister) who visits Costa Rica often or my step-mom's son instead of us?\n\nLastly, if NTA what's the best way to tell them to make this change while they are currently visiting?\n\nEDIT #1 - Also I guess we aren't able to forward and they can't receive mail directly to their house in Costa Rica because it's rural and there is no official address? Their address is just like \"100 meters south of X road\" or something. \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1701462733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/188lnn7/wibta_for_telling_my_outofcountry_dad_that_they/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also no reason they shoul get a US address unless they claim state benefits (while illegally living abroad and not registered as such). Millions of USA citizen live abroad without a permanent usa address\u2026", "NTA\n\nThe first thing I am thinking of when I started reading your post is that this could be some kind of scam where they want to keep up the pretense of still living in the USA for benefits or pension reasons or whatever, when in fact they are no longer resident there. I wouldn't want to be part of something like that.\n\nI do think it's reasonable for them to request to use your address for official communication (assuming they aren't scamming anyone) as a mail address and NOT a resident address for them, if this mail is a letter here and there (say, 1-3 a month). But I wouldn't be accepting dozens of parcels, advertisement mail etc. They are taking advantage of you if not also making you complicit in a scam or benefits fraud or insurance fraud or whatever.\n\nYou are NTA to tell them they need to use another relative for this. Your aunt sounds like the obvious solution as she is also an immediate relative and she visits CR more often so won't have the huge backlog of parcels.\n\nI wouldn't even ask them, I would tell them that you are no longer able to be their personal mail center. \"Hi, just wanted to let you know that the constant mail and parcels is becoming too much for us. We don't have time to go through this much mail, determining whether or not it is important mail, or be home to receive this many parcels, nor do we have the space to store all these parcels. You'll have to find someone else to help you out with this. How about AUNT?\"", "nta. a few years is too long for this to go on, time for them to find a permanent solution for themselves.", "NTA. Kindly let them know their mail has gotten to be more than you can handle and ask them to make other arrangements. Offer to help them transition to paperless billing and maybe open a PO Box while they\u2019re visiting. There\u2019s no need for passive aggression or ultimatums as others have advised. They are your parents and it sounds like you\u2019re wanting to be respectful to them. Good luck!", "NTA.  I would let them know this is too much and in 30 days, you will start marking all mail \"doesn't live here, return to sender\" and sending it back.", "NTA. If you have a competent Post Office, they have a form for you to fill out listing residents of your house... Fill it out, leave them off it.\n\n\nBuy a rubber stamp that says \"Return to Sender, Not at this address\" and stamp every piece of mail, use a black marker and mark out all barcodes/QR Codes, and your address (leave the name visible), and drop off mail at the PO (blue drop box, or the counter for boxes) once a week or whatever. Eventually, the mail will stop. \n\n\nI've had out of state people who tries to use my address for their drivers' license and other things even though they never lived here and they live out of state. \n\nIf you have a good relationship with your dad and his wife, they will easily remedy the situation. If they choose not... then you know where you stand with them.", "NTA. I remember another post where an estranged mother tried to claim her daughter's address as her own. The mother then tried to use that mail to claim she was a co-owner of the property. Even if your parents don't try this deliberately, it could muddy the waters enough to cause problems later on.", "NAH - You could still accept some mail, but you need to put some boundaries in place. Ask that they put themselves on Do Not Mail lists, such as DMAChoice. And also ask them not to ship anything to you until a week or a couple days prior to their arrival. And also, anything you do keep, you need to be reimbursed for shipping the mail to whoever is bringing it down to them.  \n\n\nThey may not have realized how much mail would come to you. Let them know that when you said it was ok, you did not realize the volume and you didn't sign up to be a mail sorting house. You only signed up to accept mail (not packages). If they can't abide by your boundaries, then you will no longer accept their mail and mark everything \"Return to Sender.\"  \n\n\nOf course, it's up to you if you want to give them a second chance with boundaries set in place. And you would not be TA for skipping that altogether. Again, you are not a post office, nor are you being compensated for your time to sort through the mail.", "There are services that have a real street address for mail delivery like The UPS Store that they can use.", "NTA\n\nTell them that this has become a burden and you need this to step lest you start to resent them. Remind them they said it was temporary and it\u2019s gone on too long.\n\nAlso, are they doing anything legally dodgy here? Listing yours as their address when they don\u2019t live there? If found out, could you get in trouble?\n\nGive them a clear deadline and tell them you\u2019ll be returning items to sender and turning deliveries away from that date.", "With gentle kindness, YTA. The man who raised you, fed you, supported you for 2 decades is asking for 2 minutes a day to sort through his mail. This is the bare minimum in being a dutiful child. All over the world people are caring for their elderly parents in their own homes at their expense. This is a minor inconvenience. I am thankful for the opportunities I\u2019ve had to care for my grandfather, and later my mother before they died. I was happy to give back to the people who gave so much to me. \n\nTake a step back and think about the inter generational patterns you are setting.

There are some suggestions elsewhere in the thread to reduce the spam they are getting and overall they can pay for a service like traveling mailbox or st Brendan\u2019s isle. \n\nThere\u2019s probably not a great way around the Amazon issue though, lots of places in the world don\u2019t have options for you to order online. I\u2019ve been in your parents shoes for the last 20 years, living in countries with no mail system at all, or it takes 4 months to get a simple letter which is totally unfeasible for important documents - and unfortunately lots of life admin insists on mailing you things.\n\nSo maybe the compromise is they sign up for traveling mailbox, they try to limit their Amazon orders to closer to when they are visiting (not a month in advance - although again some things you need to order aren\u2019t from Amazon and can take a few weeks to ship), and maybe also see if they are willing to compensate your time for sorting their package and storing their mail.
