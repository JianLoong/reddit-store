They asked if they could change their address to ours because they said they needed an address in the US because they are still US citizens and need a US address, I believe. We didn't think much of it at the time and were told it would be temporary so we agreed.\n\nEver since then, our mailbox has been flooded with their mail - probably 80-90% of our mail is addressed to them (it's insane how much spam mail are directed at retirees). We'd just set all mail aside, but when we told them how much we were getting, they remarked that we could open up their mail and throw away the spam and hang onto the important ones and they wouldn't mind. However, this takes much more effort because now we have to open each one and make the decision if it's important or not. Every now and again, they'd say an urgent mail is coming (new credit card, insurance, taxes, small package, etc) and ask us to send that and any other mail to another relative or friend of theirs who are planning to visit them. So we'd have to pay to ship a box of mail to that other person. Otherwise we'd give it to them when they visit.\n\nThey now visit our house 3 or 4 time a year for usually 1-2 weeks at a time to do things such as meet with tax advisors, go to medical appointments, etc. Every time before they visit, we start receiving amazon packages seeming every couple of days starting a few month prior to their visit for us to hang on to for items for them to take back to Costa Rica. This time for their current visit, the amount of packages took up the entire space under our guest bed. When I told them there was so much, they said \"Thanks for letting us know that we need to bring two suitcases\". We're two working professionals who are also getting graduate degrees who don't have a lot of time to sort mail, go to the post office to drop things off and we are tired.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I told them that we need them to change their address away from ours and stop sending packages to our house because we can't be their storage unit? Maybe have them send it to my aunt (dad's sister) who visits Costa Rica often or my step-mom's son instead of us?\n\nLastly, if NTA what's the best way to tell them to make this change while they are currently visiting?\n\nEDIT #1 - Also I guess we aren't able to forward and they can't receive mail directly to their house in Costa Rica because it's rural and there is no official address?

I was curious what options were available because things like Amazon packages don't always go through USPS so a post office box doesn't always work.  \n\nHave you ever heard of virtual mailboxes? It's a physical address where you can have mail/packages from any shipping company sent.  Then they're scanned for you to see online and decide what to do with them.  Yes there's a cost.

You're, of course, free to choose something else.  I just wanted to give you time to update everything with your new address before I stop accepting your mail for you.\"\n\nNote that you're not asking permission.  You're saying what will happen.

There is a way for them to get mail in Costa Rica they just don\u2019t want to for some reason suspect reason.", "NTA\n\nHaving been an expatriate for several years working in a foreign country, I can tell you that having a US address is extremely important. \n\nFirst, for all that we complain about the US Postal Service, it\u2019s tremendously more capable and efficient than the postal service in most countries, even some surprisingly developed ones. Forwarding mail to an overseas address is not an option. Receiving official mail from the US government is a critical part of being an adult. \n\nSecond, having a credit card from a US bank will give you far more flexibility and buying power overseas. Ditto a US checking account. However, due to anti-money laundering regulations (which are very necessary) you need to have a US mailing address to have a bank account or a credit card. \n\nThere are ways to make this work, but you need to put your foot down and tell them that you are willing to help get them set up but after a certain grace period you are going to start refusing delivery of any mail or packages  addressed to them. \n\nFirst, go paperless for everything possible. Bank statements, credit card bills, medical insurance, etc. They may be uncomfortable at first doing it electronically but this is a part of the price they need to pay for living as an expat. \n\nNext, go to https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-stop-junk-mail and follow the directions there. That will cut way down on the amount of junk mail they get. \n\nThen, sign up for an mail scanning service like travelingmailbox.com. This service receives their mail and scans the outside so that they can see the envelope. Much of their mail can be marked as to be discarded just based on this. If they want to see the contents they can request that it be opened and scanned. If it\u2019s something where they want the actual item (like a handmade card) they can have it sent via FedEx or UPS to someplace. If it contains a check the service can deposit it for them. \n\nLastly, figure out an arrangement with a place like Mailboxes Etc where they can receive packages. The prices and variety of items available in the US are far better than most places overseas, so it\u2019s understandable that they want to order things in the US and take them home but you don\u2019t need the clutter. \n\nOne final consideration \u2014 have you and your father considered how you both will handle his affairs as he gets older and frailer? All of the above steps will be useful if and when you need to step in. You should have a conversation with him about how you are going to handle healthcare and property if he can no longer live alone and needs to go into assisted living or develops dementia.", "NTA isn't this fraud?", "You don't need to open each mail peice to see if it is important or not. Anything important will have \"first class\" or a normal stamp in top right. If it doesn't have that or says pre sort standard it is junk. Post Office won't forward junk mail and they will toss those peices when someone has a forward in. Ask your parents to go paperless to reduce mail.", "YTA and what a weird hill to die on. Just chuck it in a plastic bag for them to deal with.", "Why don\u2019t you just set up mail forwarding?", "NTA! I can't believe you are doing all that for free. That is beyond generous. I'd be driven crazy by having someone else's mail and packages piling up in my home and being expected to pay to ship it to them. Ugh.\n\nThey need a PMB, which is the private equivalent of a PO box but comes with added services. There are hundreds of PMB companies out there. Mine charges about $200 per year for the basics which include a street address and receiving. For a minor additional fee per piece, they scan, forward or shred, deposit checks in a local bank account upon request, and hold stuff beyond 30 days when needed. They handle packages as well as letters, magazines, junk mail, etc. if you want a bunch of stuff forwarded at once, they can even open up all the boxes and consolidate contents to make shipping more affordable. They fill out customs declarations as well. As an expat, it meets virtually all of our US mail needs.\n\nThere is no reason you need to be doing any of this extensive labor and storage for them when they can easily pay a service to do all of their mail handling  except the prioritizing. Our service even can be set to automatically filter out bulk mail so it never even hits the inbox. Which arguably makes it better than a regular mail box. Truly a good value.", "They need to change their address now.
