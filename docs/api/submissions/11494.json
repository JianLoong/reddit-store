I've spent the day with her on Thanksgiving doing prep and 90% of that prep always involves the dessert. I have literally had to pick stuff up on the way to her place or run out and do last minute food related errands for her. because they were like 18 timed complicated steps for the desserts and she couldn't leave me alone with those while she went and grabbed stuff because I simply do not have the level of kitchen education to make those kinds of desserts no matter how great the instructions I'm given are\n\nI showed up early once to help another friend prep for a potluck. that friend was responsible for two dishes one which was a main protein and one which was a more minor side dish. the minor side dish was much more involved and much more complicated and got 90% of the attention. and was so gorgeous that we literally all stopped in the middle of dinner to take photos when it came out. I have like 40 photos of that evenings dinner on my phone and half of them are of the cats and half of them are of this one side dish (it was REALLY PRETTY), and 2 are the group pictures we took\n\nveggie burgers are pretty quick to cook themselves and if I'm prepping a meal are probably one of the last things I'm going to do. I'll not only have all of the sides and everything else prepared but I will have all of the rest of the burger stuff prepared, and tbh when I'm doing burgers or hotdogs for certain meals I have definitely spent longer cooking add ons than the actual meat/fake meat  \n\nit takes me way longer to make homemade sauerkraut then it does for me to grill a few hot dogs. it takes me way longer to make any of my homemade sauces then it takes to grill a couple burgers. if I'm doing a casual potluck where I'm asked to do a few different things I have probably spent longer on making the coleslaw than anything else (it's REALLY good slaw ok?)\n\nI probably spend longer making the gorgeous grilled onions for my burgers then I actually spend grilling the burgers. those onions also become the topping for my lentil soup which while it's not the main course gets way way more attention than the burgers do  \n\nnow normally I'm going to assume that when people talk about dinner that the main course is the most amount of work and probably the only course. lots of people will have burgers with no sides even. but the way that she has described their meals and the kind of effort that they both put into them and specifically the way she described the friend as making amazing desserts?? that is a big indicator that just because veggie burgers are the main protein doesn't mean that there isn't a whole lot of other cooking happening on things that are technically more minor\n\nand also I assume that if the veggie burgers had indicated to her that her friend wasn't really cooking and was throwing something together last minute, she would have said something and been upset about that specifically", "I'm not blaming OP for her friends lack of preparedness \n\nor for feeling tired or upset or needing to cancel\n\nthat's all totally valid and none of that makes her an asshole\n\nbut letting multiple resentments build in the relationship without communicating? that is on OP. if you're unhappy about something in a relationship and you don't tell the other person? how are they supposed to know and change? and that doesn't make OP TA. but it is something that needs to change if she wants the friendship to work out\n\nneither of them are assholes in this situation \n\nOP is stressed and stretched past her limit and needed to cancel. okay that's fine. it is a bit much that she expected her friend to pick up on things she never expressed, but I don't think that's asshole behaviour   \n\nOPs friend is a bit disorganised yes, but is simply asking a favour of OP that *OP has asked of her on a fairly regular basis*. and that OP has never communicated being an issue  \n\nOPs friend isn't TA either   \n\nthey're both frustrated and they're both disappointed but frankly this is a fairly small friendship issue that should be easily fixable by communicating"]}
