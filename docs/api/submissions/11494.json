Occasionally I start when she arrives, but I always have the food IN the house before she gets there. Anything she might pick up on the way is extra (e.g. lemon for zesting over pasta) not a necessity.\n\nHowever. The past two times I\u2019ve been invited for dinner at hers, she\u2019s been disorganised and asked me to go to the shop to get key ingredients which the meal can\u2019t be made without. \n\nI\u2019ve done it because at the time it felt like no big deal - although it was inconvenient and added more to the cost than I\u2019d originally intended to spend. I have an intense job and on both occasions I was tired but looking forward to eating her delicious food and spending time with my pal, so happy to do it.\n\nSo. We organise to see each other on the Friday night just gone, after work so I know we\u2019re both likely to be zonked. I wanted to ask her advice on a big decision I have to make at work. She\u2019s been particularly stressed over the past few months and we\u2019ve spent a lot of time working through her issues, so I\u2019m owed a little catch up time. \n\nThat Friday night I leave work relived someone was cooking. I was starving and couldn\u2019t wait to slump into her couch with a large glass of wine after another rough day, chat things through, laugh it off and reset.\n\nAs usual I go to a supermarket to pick some nice wine and a few other yummy bits. Shortly after I leave, I get a text saying \u201cI need you to go to the corner shop to get some veggie burgers on your way to mine\u201d.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m making my way through one of the busiest streets in the city to a train station.

I\u2019m exhausted and just want to sit down and unwind. She asks again \u201cwhy can\u2019t you just go to the shop?\u201d\n\nAnd for some reason, I just see red. \n\nInstead of getting on the train to her area I tell her to cancel. I\u2019m going to go home and go to bed. I just need to chill and the request has pushed me over the edge. \n\nNow we\u2019re arguing. \n\nShe\u2019s angry I bailed and has said my reaction was ridiculous.

That's ridiculous, it's like inviting you over for Easter dinner and asking you to pick up a ham on the way!", "NTA\n\nIf it's no big deal, why didn't she stop at the store on her way home?", "NTA.  If you\u2019re inviting someone to dinner, it\u2019s normal to say bring a bottle of wine.  But to ask for stuff you should have already bought in order to make the dinner you\u2019re inviting me to? I\u2019ll stay at home and cook instead.\nEdit for typo", "NTA\n\nAsking you to essentially provide the main course is a bit much. Is she perhaps the type to push and push and push until you explode? \n\nBoundaries make good dinner partners and now she knows yours.", "NTA Thinking you need to let her know what your expectations are, as you are making sure her experience at your house is good and she sloughs off a lot on her guest. If she continues to think you are overreacting, then maybe your styles are too different to continue this alternating dinner party, fun as it sounds, as you have built up some resentment at her lack of organization. She doesn't seem willing to take her turn properly.", "NTA. And damn, you sound like an excellent foodie friend.", "NTA. When you invite someone over you either provide the meal, or ask them in advance to bring something specific. It sounds like you\u2019ve had a balanced contribution to the evenings through your friendship.\n\nThe sudden change in plans was not aligned with the night you\u2019d expected, and you\u2019re allowed to change your mind.\n\nOr suggest ordering pizza.", "NTA, it sounds like she wasn\u2019t picking up on the cues you were putting down. While situations like this are mostly a two-way street, I agree with your decision to cool off at home.", "NTA it\u2019s the hosts duty to have everything they need ready for their guests. \n\nI mean it\u2019s one thing to call and go \u201cmy dude I just dropped the entire tin of chili flakes into the pasta sauce and I can\u2019t leave the other pots and oven\u2026 could you do me the favor and swing by to either get a can of ready sauce or a gallon of milk to ease the burn if we eat this?\u201d But she wasn\u2019t doing that she was just planning on you shopping for her.", "NTA - is she invited you or your cash to dinner?", "NTA. Even if she didn\u2019t ask you to go stop on the way you still would not be TA if you wanted to cancel an hour beforehand. You were clearly exhausted and you do not need to bear the brunt of your your friend\u2019s chaotic cooking style. Your friend has bad manners. I\u2019d let them know that in the future if she wants you to come over for dinner, then all the ingredients need to get there before you do.", "I think the fact that you'd just left the store and was dealing with traffic really added to your stress. And veggie burgers? Seriously? For a foodie? You're NTA but tell her that for next time, if there is one, if she wants you to pick up food she needs to give you advance notice, not while you're in the middle of traffic. Or, tell her she could get the dinner organized ahead of time just like you do. Maybe she's using you to help supplement her grocery budget too. Don't be afraid to make more friends either. I've heard of cooking classes that some people really enjoy. Maybe you could try one and find people that would like to get together to experiment cooking special cuisine.", "NTA is there something happening in her life that means she is less organised than usual? You guys seem like good friends so I\u2019m sure with some communication you can make up with each other.", "NTA. It's hard out there for us singletons trying to socialize after work, but your friend was being a little too presumptuous. She said \"I need you to go to the corner shop\" when she should have said something like \"I invited you for dinner but forgot the trifling detail of actually buying dinner. Would you be willing to go the corner shop? If so, I will pay you back and if not, I understand.\" You were within your rights to decide you weren't up for buying the whole dinner on the way to the dinner. Your friend was not really within her rights to ask you why you \"can't just go to the shop\" in response. Why couldn't SHE just go to the shop?", "NTA  She asked, you said you'd rather not, and that should have been the end of it.", "OP what happened with just stating the obvious to her that when you go by her house you feel slighted you don't want to be on the hook for being responsible for extra time and money compared to when she comes by your place that she just brings herself?  If she starts deflecting and doesn't take responsibility for short changing you, then it's time you either accept the current scenario or start looking for another foodie alternative because she's not going to change her side of the arrangement.  You have no obligation to continue it if she wants to keep it unequal, so move on instead of wasting time and money on an apparent foodie freeloader.", "NTA. I'd never ask someone to dinner, then make them do the grocery shopping. That's whack.", "NTA.   \nShe realised that she can use you, and you let her.\n\nNow you have set things straight, and she doesn\u2019t like it.", "LoL", "Definitely NTA...    BUT it sounds like you have a good friend here.  I'd be the bigger person here and apologize, even if you think she's in the wrong (and it sounds like she is from your perspective.)  This isn't something worth losing a good friend over.\n\nIn a few weeks you'll be laughing over this incident and will be able to sort things out with these requests, ie if she's missing an ingredient Door Dash is a good substitute.", "I love 1st world problems...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
