In that time his parents have died and when his relationship ended he asked my wife (his daughter) (f32) to come and stay with us while he sorted himself out.\n\n4 months later he still lived with us and showed no sign of moving out. My wife and I agreed that since he was earning a good wage now we needed to increase his rent to just below market rate for a room in this area. To encourage him to think he might as well get his own place if he\u2019s paying that much here.\n\nI know it\u2019s our own fault for not just being more direct and telling him he needs to move out but he is very sensitive and always on the verge of breakdown/blowing up.\n\nHis job does mean he\u2019s away for half the week so he was very surprised when the rent went up. Despite practically living here for free prior to that and him now being on a better wage than my wife.\n\nSince then he has been doing weird things like doing his laundry at a laundrette. Buying a portable heater instead of using central heating. We think now he was trying to reduce the amount he was costing so the increase in rent would be even more outrageous.\n\nAnyway\u2026 he left for work, but one of our cats was stuck in his room after he left, so we opened the door. Saw he\u2019d left a pile of rubbish including takeaway containers. Which stank. My wife texted him pointing this out. He said fine I\u2019ll move out when I get back. He was angry she\u2019d been in his room. Felt that it was invading his privacy. We did say well actually that\u2019s our spare room. Youre only staying in it until you find your own place. This led to loads of messages accusing us of making him feel unwelcome, patronised, and it being unfair for charging rent when he was away half the week. My wife over the week gave him multiple opportunities to say he was coming back as he had nowhere else to go but he just said she\u2019d given him no choice.\n\nCome the day he was supposed to return, we waited, he didn\u2019t come back, my wife text and said if you\u2019re not coming back you should come and get your stuff. He said burn it: you\u2019ve seen me out on the street, I\u2019m sleeping in my car, your Nan would be ashamed of you. We knew he\u2019d been paid that day. we drove around and saw he\u2019d parked at the end of our road and was sleeping in his car. She said one last time, that was vile thing to say (she nursed her Nan through cancer while he lived abroad) but you can come back to give yourself a bit of time to find somewhere to live. He said no because you\u2019ve turned on me: so we left him to sleep in his car. The next day (once he\u2019d proved his point imo) he went to a hotel. Now he\u2019s telling all the extended family we left him homeless and he had to sleep in his car. I don\u2019t feel bad but my wife is feeling guilty. We both know if we had pleaded for him to come back and apologised to him he\u2019d have probably agreed to move back in. AITA?\n\nEdit: some people talking about him having tenancy rights. I\u2019ve checked and legally he\u2019d be classed as a lodger and so he didn\u2019t have tenancy rights. Lodger rights don\u2019t give you exclusive use to a room and he even though we tried to give him space, we were perfectly within our rights to go in and get the cat. In the same way adult children don\u2019t get tenancy rights when paying board to a parent.", "created_utc": 1701704993, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18an0v9/aita_for_letting_my_father_in_law_sleep_in_his_car/", "score": 232, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No, you're not going to beg anyone to come in and trash your house, but if they'd like to bring him into theirs, they know how to reach him.\n\nI feel sorry for your wife, she doesn't need to deal with the BS.

He is a grown ass man and is responsible for his choices and the consequences that follow.", "Nope, not at all. Sounds like your FIL is just being a drama queen and trying to guilt trip you guys into feeling bad for him.

If you charge him as tenant, he has tenant rights. Cat in room is OPs and SO problem, cat should not be in room in first place. Then they entered in room without first asking, and then complain that room is not perfectly clean, if this is any other tenant this would be grand for violating tenants rights. They are AH, OP and SO. They wanted to charge him rent as tenant but still OP was commenting like his is some bad guy because his own daughter decided to charge him increased rent, but then they go back as he is just family staying in house so why we don't just enter in room he is paying. \n\nOP YTA!", "No I\u2019ve checked and he\u2019s not got exclusive use of the property so he doesn\u2019t have tenancy rights.

We made his meals, did all the cleaning and he lived here for 3 months before he got a job and we asked for a minimal amount to cover his food etc. not rent. He actually left before paying the the increased amount. So he never actually paid any real amount of rent, but even if he had, my cat was trapped in his room.

He wants to be the martyr and the victim so he can manipulate you both to get his way. Enough, he\u2019s an adult and needs to act as one. You owe him nothing.", "Sounds to me like he is the one who is making the decisions. I am sure your wife is feeling guilty but he was clearly using you even though he was paying rent. He needs to be an adult. If he wants to live in a hotel so be it. He has other choices available to him.", "Tantrum is exactly the word to describe his behavior. I bet he throws another one about his belongings once he realizes the first one isn't working. NTA", "That\u2019s not true. Legally he was a lodger not a tenant and so had no tenancy rights", "That\u2019s not true. He\u2019d be classed as a lodger and we didn\u2019t agree for him to have exclusive use of the room. The money he paid was board, for meals and bills etc, he was contributing to the household as a family member. Same was as charging adult children board doesn\u2019t mean they then have tenancy rights"]}
