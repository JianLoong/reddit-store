In that time his parents have died and when his relationship ended he asked my wife (his daughter) (f32) to come and stay with us while he sorted himself out.\n\n4 months later he still lived with us and showed no sign of moving out. My wife and I agreed that since he was earning a good wage now we needed to increase his rent to just below market rate for a room in this area. To encourage him to think he might as well get his own place if he\u2019s paying that much here.\n\nI know it\u2019s our own fault for not just being more direct and telling him he needs to move out but he is very sensitive and always on the verge of breakdown/blowing up.\n\nHis job does mean he\u2019s away for half the week so he was very surprised when the rent went up. Despite practically living here for free prior to that and him now being on a better wage than my wife.\n\nSince then he has been doing weird things like doing his laundry at a laundrette. Buying a portable heater instead of using central heating. We think now he was trying to reduce the amount he was costing so the increase in rent would be even more outrageous.\n\nAnyway\u2026 he left for work, but one of our cats was stuck in his room after he left, so we opened the door. Saw he\u2019d left a pile of rubbish including takeaway containers. Which stank. My wife texted him pointing this out. He said fine I\u2019ll move out when I get back. He was angry she\u2019d been in his room. Felt that it was invading his privacy. We did say well actually that\u2019s our spare room. Youre only staying in it until you find your own place. This led to loads of messages accusing us of making him feel unwelcome, patronised, and it being unfair for charging rent when he was away half the week. My wife over the week gave him multiple opportunities to say he was coming back as he had nowhere else to go but he just said she\u2019d given him no choice.\n\nCome the day he was supposed to return, we waited, he didn\u2019t come back, my wife text and said if you\u2019re not coming back you should come and get your stuff. He said burn it: you\u2019ve seen me out on the street, I\u2019m sleeping in my car, your Nan would be ashamed of you. We knew he\u2019d been paid that day. we drove around and saw he\u2019d parked at the end of our road and was sleeping in his car. She said one last time, that was vile thing to say (she nursed her Nan through cancer while he lived abroad) but you can come back to give yourself a bit of time to find somewhere to live. He said no because you\u2019ve turned on me: so we left him to sleep in his car. The next day (once he\u2019d proved his point imo) he went to a hotel. Now he\u2019s telling all the extended family we left him homeless and he had to sleep in his car. I don\u2019t feel bad but my wife is feeling guilty. We both know if we had pleaded for him to come back and apologised to him he\u2019d have probably agreed to move back in.

At least this seems to be resolving itself.\n\nIgnore the guilt trip, you and your wife did absolutely nothing wrong. \n\nIf any extended family say something, be perfectly clear - he CHOSE to sleep in his car because you took issue with him letting trash rot in the house instead of tossing it - were you supposed to force him into your house? If so, how? Tie him up and drag him in? No, you're not going to beg anyone to come in and trash your house, but if they'd like to bring him into theirs, they know how to reach him.\n\nI feel sorry for your wife, she doesn't need to deal with the BS. Still, it's better kept out of the house than in it.", "NTA\n\nIt was his choice to sleep in his car.  You didn\u2019t tell him he had to do that and told him he could come back to the house.\n\nHe made himself a martyr.  \n\nAlso, rent is not calculated on how much time you spend at the place you\u2019re renting.  \n\nI had a business trip when I was renting years ago and was away for a month.  I was still responsible for paying my rent while I was away.  It doesn\u2019t get prorated bc you\u2019re not spending time in the place you\u2019re renting.  He was out of line on that too.", "NTA\n\nDon't let him guilt trip you into taking him back.", "NTA - if the other family members want to take him in, let them.", "NTA.  F*** him. You gave him a chance to come back. Just show the family you talking to him about coming back and how he acts.  Let him be stubborn and freeze out there. Maybe your extended family can put up with him", "NTA. \n\nHe literally chose to sleep in his car. There isn\u2019t anything more to it. If he wants to throw a tantrum, let him. It\u2019ll give him the motivation to actually move out because he now feels uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nYour FIL tries to make himself the victim. He acts as if you'd force him to sleep in his car, but you didn't. He did this on purpose so he can tell everybody you did. \n\nHe is a manipulative asshole.\n\nHe wants you to bend over and do as he please.\n\nHe wants to have power over you.\n\nAnd the fact that your wife is feeling guilty although she has done nothing wrong, proves that he did this for a very long time in her life.", "Nta", "NTA. He was counting on you begging him to move back, at which point it would then have been impossible to get rid of him. No, he is out now. If he is mad, he can get good again in his own good time. The arrangement was never meant to be permanent to begin with. He knew that and was counting on another outcome.", "NTA his choice and sounds like he was hoping to guilt you both for a cheap ride as long as possible", "NTA.\n\nI think it is great that you let your father in law sleep in his car. I mean, kicking him out of his own car? That would be mean.", "NTA.  He was happy playing the victim card and never had any intention of moving to his own place.", "NTA. He made his choice so he got to sleep in his choice.  You offered, you are not required to do that, nor are you required to beg.  Let the guilt go.  He is a grown ass man and is responsible for his choices and the consequences that follow.", "Nope, not at all. Sounds like your FIL is just being a drama queen and trying to guilt trip you guys into feeling bad for him. He's a grown man with a job, he can find his own place to live instead of mooching off of you guys forever. Maybe this will be the wake-up call he needs.", "Freddy Freeloader was trying to cut off his nose to spite his face. You got him out, that is what matters", "NTA. He slept in his car on purpose just so he could trash you to the family and guilt trip his daughter.\n\nBut at least he's gone, yay!", "NTA, and you also shouldn't apologise to get him to move back in. If you do he'll just be even worse next time.\n\nI'd pack his things up so they're at least in boxes, otherwise throwing them out will come back to bite you in the future. Then when he's calmed down and less sulky about it all you can hand his things over without giving him the ammo of \"see, they threw out my belongings\" with the extended family.\n\nIf you hadn't gone in his room to retrieve the cat then there would have been piss and poo all over his room, possibly on his bed, and he would be angry about that too. The fact that he had left the place in a mess is his fault, not yours, and you definitely could not have it left in that state without risking vermin.\n\nLet him sulk in his hotel room and let any family members who are shocked know that they're welcome to house him instead.", "NTA. At his age, he should know better than trying to be a freeloader. Does he not own a house? Smh", "He sounds manipulative in the extreme.

NTA", "NTA, he knows perfectly well he could\u2019ve come back to your house.", "NTA he's doing it to himself, and you should not feel bad at all.

He hasn\u2019t paid rent up until now anyway. Conviently moving out when it was due for the first time. But even if we are asking him to contribute, that pays for the gas, electric water, food, bills etc, but it\u2019s still our spare room. This is only a favour until he moved out. We didn\u2019t see this as him renting a room we saw it as him being given somewhere to stay as a favour not as a contracted rental agreement. I don\u2019t understand his or your opinion that he was renting a room, even though we didn\u2019t go in there unless emergencies like cat accidently getting trapped", "I suppose I refer to it as rent throughout so easy to assume it\u2019s rent. I guess we we\u2019re viewing it more as board. Before he moved away he stayed with his parents when he was single. That was always clear that their spare room was not his room, but he paid board to his parents. We felt that this was the same here too. But we deffo should have been more upfront."]}
