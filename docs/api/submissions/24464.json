It's strange that she sent them to a high school friend she is not really on contact with and contacts via Instagram. NTA. She could just post these pictures on Instagram or Facebook and reach a wider and more interested audience.", "NTA, she didn\u2019t have to go out of her way to reach out and she ASKED why and then got upset when you told her why. People don\u2019t block others for no reason, it\u2019s common sense. I can\u2019t tell if this girl is self obsessed and thinks everyone on planet earth loves her or if she\u2019s just lonely and seeking a friend in a very odd way\u2026 but either way. she shouldn\u2019t have gone out of her way to ask you. it\u2019s weird when people get blocked and they find any other way to contact you.", "NTA. You barely know her. Why does she imagine that you would care?", "He's not right, soneine you barely know was slamming you. Sure you could fave said something but at the end of the day, it's a peripheral person in the story of your life and it's just as easy to block them considering your relationship has been receiving pictures of her baby that you didn't ask for. NTA", "That is so weird. Who sends messages with baby announcements and updates to an acquaintance from high school? I probably would have said hey I\u2019m happy for you but no need to send daily updates wish you the best and then blocked her. For her to reach out on her husbands page is also weird. NTA", "NTA. Such odd behaviour!", "I think you, OP, could have found a more creative way to let her know you do not like the daily pics (like sending *her* dailies of your trash barrel) but you are still NTA, IMO, since her DMs were excessive and unsolicited.", "NTA, though you could have probably been more tactful in communicating that you were getting too many baby updates. \"I barely know you and I'm not comfortable getting so many messages every day from someone I don't know,\" would have been just fine. Still, you had every right to block them.", "NTA. Too much people believes that being a mother will open the doors of fame.", "NTA\n\n> \"doesn't understand the joys of motherhood\"\n\nI was expecting you to reveal you were the only person she knew with kids, but it doesn't even sound like you have any!\n\nIt's very odd she's sending such private dms to you. I would have blocked her too. I doubt she would have reacted any better had you explained your feelings earlier.\n\nThere are *so many* mother/parent groups both online and irl in libraries and sport centres etc. She should have no problem finding others who actually want to talk about being a new mother.", "So - I don't know if Instagram has a setting to automatically send \\*everyone\\* in your list a message/photos/etc...   \nThere's probably a slightly more tactful way you could have told her you were done with the baby updates - but the pics of dirty diapers is beyond the pale.   \nNTA", "You are the only reasonable person in this equation. I'm pissed at your boyfriend on your behalf. You should forward every dumb photo this person sends you and he can see how it feels. Baby's are very boring. What's more boring is someone you don't know well's baby. You owe this person nothing. I've got to tell you my friends who have kids have never done this to me.", "NTA. Maybe you should take snaps of your daily bm's and send her those? All with cute captions: \"I don't know what got into me last night, but here it is now!*winky face*\"", "NTA. There are people on my instagram who are muted because of their constant baby sharing stories. I can\u2019t imagine having them DM\u2019ed to you. \n\nBut before blocking her, I would maybe have talked to her and told her I\u2019d prefer not to get all those pictures. If she continued after that, I would block. Not as a first resort.", "NTA", "NTA damn, someone\u2019s gotta be super desperate for attention to hit up people they only lightly interacted with a while back with constant photos of their baby.\n\nThey should just do what many parents do in this day and age: post constant photos of their child on their social media feed (not DM) and people who don\u2019t want to see the photo tsunami can quietly unfollow them.", "She is lonely as a young mother and looks for a friend. But she got way overboard and you had every right to block here. She maybe even have the baby blues or something.", "It\u2019s august, so he\u2019s almost 1 now and you accepted baby pics including bath and nappy pictures hourly 24 hours a day, for 13 months and said nothing and then suddenly blocked her?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She sounds like she\u2019s lonely and reaching out to people that she met years ago to gain followers. Probably wants to be a mommy influencer", "NTA - that's super weird on her part....as a parent I don't like sharing photos of my daughter to people let alone hounding some random person I'm not even close with everyday. That's really weird behavior", "I feel like OP thinks they\u2019re not close but the mother thinks otherwise. I feel like there is another side to the story. Hmmm.", "I thought.. is she expecting a gift or something ?", "Yes and that\u2019s completely acceptable. What\u2019re you on about? NTA", "NTA - I'm sure if you started spamming up her inbox with updates about your awesome child-free life she'd get plenty peeved. She didn't give you the \"click here to unsubscribe\" option along with the messages so you had to do what you could", "NTA I have a friend I've known for years and I like her kid but when she posts like 12 pictures of him on her Snapchat I roll my eyes. No one cares about your kid like you do.", "NTA. I'd have asked why she thought I'd want constant baby and diaper pics, but that's just me", "NTA. She needs to learn the value of the adage \"don't ask questions you don't want the answers to.\"", "For some people having a baby is high level of achievement in their life, therefore, they go overboard and sometimes (actually most of the times) they are very annoying. NYA. You tolerated her for a long time, I would have ignored the first message.", "Your boyfriend is right, this is an assholish move. But, I would do more or less what you did. Sometimes, we have to be AHs for getting rid of annoying people. It is better to play along for a while because, in your case, being a mother is something amazing. But, after a certain point, there is nothing else to do. Just try to be as gentle as you can.", "OP was never really friends with her so why would she  constantly send OP updates?", "NTA why on earth would you care that someone had a kid. If it makes no impact on your existence why should you give a shit. I'm sure she's thrilled with her child but that doesn't mean you have to be.", "NTA. im tired of everyone thinking they care about their baby. sorry not sorry.", "NTA.\n\nTell her to get a puppy if she's that desparate for attention.\n\nAnd that is exactly why she contacted you - she wanted you to ooh and awe over it. I can only imagine how many other people she is doing this with - did she get out the yearbooks, and dug throught social media for profiles?", "NTA. coming from a mom who thinks every single thing my child does is cute and I want to eat her up, I couldn't imagine sending pictures of her to high school acquaintances who I barely spoke to. \n\nAwwkkwardddddd", "NTA i guess the people around her are already fed up with her baby updates and now she is looking for others to annoy", "NTA \n\nYou're not friends, you presumably weren't encouraging this barrage of updates... the pinnacle of the 'joys of motherhood' isn't spamming randomers on SM with pics of poop from what I can gather...\n\nI'd be wondering if she hasn't heard rumours of you previously being very generous with baby gifts to some mutual friend from HS when they had their baby or something. Anyway... very odd behaviour. Probably best if she's offended enough to leave you alone moving forward.", "NTA. Guessing Stephanie doesn\u2019t have any friends and is looking for someone to share baby updates with. Super weird.", "Did she have you confused with someone else?", "[removed]", "Scrolling up furiously to see what Uber mom posted about diapers\u2026\u2026.brb.", "Reread. The mom is sending diaper photos. Your example situation is the situation happening.", "How close do you have to be to send pictures of poop/diapers!? I've never been that close with anyone.", "Either way, people who constantly send unrequested pics with their babies are annoying. Like wtf cares about your kid's picture?", "If you're going to send me those photos, you better buy me dinner first.", "My cousin sent me a diaper blow out picture because she knows I am repulsed by dipers/ think kids are gross in general. I sent her a picture of my dogs poop. We both laughed at grossing each other out and she said she wasn't going to do it again because I'm much bigger than my dog and she knew I'd photograph my own the next time she did it. The difference was of course I had a close relationship with my cousin and I love her little petri dish even if I think she is kindof gross.", "When my first kid was born my MIL wanted to watch me change his diapers over FaceTime. That was a hard no from me. He was her first grandchild but still\u2026 that\u2019s too much enthusiasm!", "HAHAHAHAHAHA. \ud83d\ude02", "Oh i so agree with that", "OP could\u2019ve just told her to stop if she found it annoying. This may be hard to believe but new mother\u2019s hormones are all over the place and maybe it was her way of sharing her emotions. There are other ways to stop receiving pics. \n\nAgain, I feel like there\u2019s more to the story. It seems to me the mother is experiencing PPD. A little empathy is not hard.", "Babies are so gross but man these toddler years \u2014 my toddler is disgusting \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "That's...no...\n\nUh, yay for enthusiasm, but that's unnecessary.", "Seriously, it's not a on-off, \"Hey can you identify this medical issue for me?\" which would be a humiliating situation that would definitely come with a \"do not open this image if you're eating chocolate pudding right now\" warning. It sounds like OP is receiving \"Take a gander at the glorious log my beautiful child has dropped\" messages which is weird as fuck", "She seems to have a lot of energy and take pride to keep getting photos and sending them to an acquaintance. I don't see why one would think of PPD.", "I never heard of ppd making you send pictures to distant people you know. \n\n \n\n>new mother\u2019s hormones are all over the place and maybe it was her way of sharing her emotions.\n\nWith someone she doesn't have and never had any kind of relationship?? \n\n>This may be hard to believe\n\nThis may be hard to believe, but not everyone cares that someone they knew in school had a kid. \n\n>, I feel like there\u2019s more to the story\n\nUnless it's that op begged for the pictures, it's irrelevant. \n\n>There are other ways to stop receiving pics. \n\nOp could've told her to stop the fuck out, or tell her the kid is ugly, but she chose the easiest way. She doesn't have a relationship with this person, so blocking her seem like the best solution.", "The mother could use a little empathy to stop sending diaper photos ew", "But she blocked her, which is basically stopping the communication. If blocked why would you contact someone to find out why? Take the block as an indication they don't want to see what you are sending."]}
