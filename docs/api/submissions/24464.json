It's strange that she sent them to a high school friend she is not really on contact with and contacts via Instagram. NTA. She could just post these pictures on Instagram or Facebook and reach a wider and more interested audience.", "NTA, she didn\u2019t have to go out of her way to reach out and she ASKED why and then got upset when you told her why. People don\u2019t block others for no reason, it\u2019s common sense. I can\u2019t tell if this girl is self obsessed and thinks everyone on planet earth loves her or if she\u2019s just lonely and seeking a friend in a very odd way\u2026 but either way. she shouldn\u2019t have gone out of her way to ask you. it\u2019s weird when people get blocked and they find any other way to contact you.", "NTA. You barely know her. Why does she imagine that you would care?", "He's not right, soneine you barely know was slamming you. Sure you could fave said something but at the end of the day, it's a peripheral person in the story of your life and it's just as easy to block them considering your relationship has been receiving pictures of her baby that you didn't ask for. NTA", "That is so weird. Who sends messages with baby announcements and updates to an acquaintance from high school? I probably would have said hey I\u2019m happy for you but no need to send daily updates wish you the best and then blocked her. For her to reach out on her husbands page is also weird. NTA", "NTA. Such odd behaviour!", "I think you, OP, could have found a more creative way to let her know you do not like the daily pics (like sending *her* dailies of your trash barrel) but you are still NTA, IMO, since her DMs were excessive and unsolicited.", "NTA, though you could have probably been more tactful in communicating that you were getting too many baby updates. \"I barely know you and I'm not comfortable getting so many messages every day from someone I don't know,\" would have been just fine. Still, you had every right to block them.", "NTA. Too much people believes that being a mother will open the doors of fame.", "NTA\n\n> \"doesn't understand the joys of motherhood\"\n\nI was expecting you to reveal you were the only person she knew with kids, but it doesn't even sound like you have any!\n\nIt's very odd she's sending such private dms to you. I would have blocked her too. I doubt she would have reacted any better had you explained your feelings earlier.\n\nThere are *so many* mother/parent groups both online and irl in libraries and sport centres etc. She should have no problem finding others who actually want to talk about being a new mother.", "So - I don't know if Instagram has a setting to automatically send \\*everyone\\* in your list a message/photos/etc...   \nThere's probably a slightly more tactful way you could have told her you were done with the baby updates - but the pics of dirty diapers is beyond the pale.   \nNTA", "You are the only reasonable person in this equation. I'm pissed at your boyfriend on your behalf. You should forward every dumb photo this person sends you and he can see how it feels. Baby's are very boring. What's more boring is someone you don't know well's baby. You owe this person nothing. I've got to tell you my friends who have kids have never done this to me.", "NTA. Maybe you should take snaps of your daily bm's and send her those? All with cute captions: \"I don't know what got into me last night, but here it is now!*winky face*\"", "NTA. There are people on my instagram who are muted because of their constant baby sharing stories. I can\u2019t imagine having them DM\u2019ed to you. \n\nBut before blocking her, I would maybe have talked to her and told her I\u2019d prefer not to get all those pictures. If she continued after that, I would block. Not as a first resort.", "NTA", "NTA damn, someone\u2019s gotta be super desperate for attention to hit up people they only lightly interacted with a while back with constant photos of their baby.\n\nThey should just do what many parents do in this day and age: post constant photos of their child on their social media feed (not DM) and people who don\u2019t want to see the photo tsunami can quietly unfollow them.", "She is lonely as a young mother and looks for a friend. But she got way overboard and you had every right to block here. She maybe even have the baby blues or something.", "It\u2019s august, so he\u2019s almost 1 now and you accepted baby pics including bath and nappy pictures hourly 24 hours a day, for 13 months and said nothing and then suddenly blocked her?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She sounds like she\u2019s lonely and reaching out to people that she met years ago to gain followers. Probably wants to be a mommy influencer", "NTA - that's super weird on her part....as a parent I don't like sharing photos of my daughter to people let alone hounding some random person I'm not even close with everyday. That's really weird behavior", "I feel like OP thinks they\u2019re not close but the mother thinks otherwise. I feel like there is another side to the story. Hmmm.", "I thought.. is she expecting a gift or something ?", "Yes and that\u2019s completely acceptable. What\u2019re you on about? NTA"]}
