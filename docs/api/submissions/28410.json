You did only what we all have to do sometimes. \n\nI work as a school photographer during the fall and the complaints I hear from parents are so ridiculous sometimes. Why aren\u2019t all 27 of these six-year-olds looking and smiling perfectly in every picture?! Because they\u2019re 27 six-year-olds, that\u2019s why. \n\nNTA", "NTA - Explain to him how business works.  Especially that sector called Nonya Business where amatuers are supposed to STFU when pros are at work.", "NTA  \n\n\nAlthough I could see how he would be embarrassed because you pointing out it was his fault its just that. His fault. He could have taken the earlier conversation along side with you pointing out everything about the camera as a hint. Then he wouldn't have made the comment about the family looking dumb at instructions. But you drove the point into his head afterwards.  \nMaybe a little harsh but I have family like this and its needed. so again NTA", "NTA. As a fellow image-maker, sometimes you have to be blunt to break through people's casual ignorance and force some situational awareness.", "NTA - he complained about previous pictures, that he had ruined, and had the nerve to try and pull the same stunt. I'd wager real money that for your cousin's wedding, that \"weren't great\" were done for free. The old man's just salty because he WAS being an asshole for the previous photos - you were just being proactive to prevent the same thing happening again.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
