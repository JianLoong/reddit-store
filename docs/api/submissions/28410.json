You did only what we all have to do sometimes. \n\nI work as a school photographer during the fall and the complaints I hear from parents are so ridiculous sometimes. Why aren\u2019t all 27 of these six-year-olds looking and smiling perfectly in every picture?! Because they\u2019re 27 six-year-olds, that\u2019s why. \n\nNTA\n\nEdit to add more fun parent complaints and an anecdote: I always give a little spiel about how to take a good class photo before we start- \n\nTalk about good posture how to stand, etc. Then: \u201cNow I know that I PROBABLY don\u2019t have to say this to YOU guys because you\u2019re all so great. But just in case: REMEMBER TO LOOK INTO THE CAMERA,\u201d while pointing emphatically where to look. \u201c\n\nBecause while (insert class size -1) are looking FANTASTIC, ::strike a perfect smile/posture pose:: ONE of you is going going to be looking away! ::dumb face looking to the side:: Whoa! A butterfly! \nOr fixing their hair ::dumb face tucking hair behind ear:: Or talking to the person next to them ::show another exaggerated dumb face::\n\nIt usually works to give them a visual example of how to not look, and to get them laughing. seems fairly effective. Then promise to let them take a silly one at the end.\n\nParent complaints:\n\n1. Why isn\u2019t Jimmy wearing the nice Jacket I told him to wear? \n\n     I don\u2019t control what they\u2019re wearing ma\u2019am. \n\n2. Why did you let Jimmy take pictures wearing that jacket- I told him he\u2019s not allowed to. \n      \n     See 1\n\n3. Why does Jimmy look so sad/mad?\n\n      Because Jimmy just got yelled at for fuckin around and ruining it for everyone else by the teacher or myself and this is the only shot without him making crazy faces/bunny ears/middle finger/not keeping their hands to themselves or yelling and being a distraction. Or maybe some other kid was mean while standing in line. Or maybe he forgot his lunch. Or\u2026\n     \n\n4. Why is the background so ugly? Why don\u2019t we take school pictures at an art museum or theme park?\n\n      How much budget do you think there is for school photos? A lot of the Teachers are already bummed about losing a half hour of teaching time. So\u2026 the school gym it is.\n\n5. Why didn\u2019t you photoshop Jimmy\u2019s acne/braces/freckles/mole/oily skin?!\n\n       This photo documents how this class was on a given day. Love your kid how they are ffs. I\u2019ll adjust light, photoshop some open eyes from another shot on the kids with closed eyes, or edit any sneaky middle fingers/gang signs out. But that\u2019s about it. \n\n6. Why can\u2019t we parents vote for the best photo? Why can\u2019t we see them all? \n\n      Sir, if this is the one we chose and you think it\u2019s bad\u2026 then you don\u2019t want to see how bad the other options were.", "NTA - Explain to him how business works.  Especially that sector called Nonya Business where amatuers are supposed to STFU when pros are at work.", "NTA  \n\n\nAlthough I could see how he would be embarrassed because you pointing out it was his fault its just that. His fault. He could have taken the earlier conversation along side with you pointing out everything about the camera as a hint.
