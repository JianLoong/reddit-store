To him, anything less than Bjorn Lothbrok or Kratos is literally a F-word (he uses that word a lot), he acts like a barbarian to prove that he is \"a real man\". My uncle says that my dad is embarrassing and that he hides a lot of insecurities, so they do not have a good relationship.\n\nOf course, that means I've always had to walk on eggshells because he'll call me a f-word for doing things he doesn't think are manly enough, but it hasn't worked because I'm obviously very flamboyant and effeminate. I don't know, I'm not even gay (I think I'm bisexual but I'm not sure), I try to act normal, walk normal, etc, but my dad would call me out for being effeminate and a \"s***y\".\n\nWe've had a lot of fights over the past few months, he thinks college is brainwashing me into supporting F-words and the woke agenda (like, yeah, I have gay friends, what a nightmare /s), until he finally decided I was too much of an embarrassment and disappointment, so he kicked me out. \n\nLuckily I had some friends with an extra sofa and some savings. I managed to find a small apartment for myself, but I didn't have enough money for the deposit and the rent for the next few months. I was desperate, so I sold the car my uncle had given me. After that, I secured the apartment, moved out, and had some extra money to get me through the first few months.\n\nMy uncle contacted me after I moved out and said he had a big fight with my dad and told me he was a lost cause. We talked for a while and then he asked about the car. I told him I sold it, and now he was mad at me, not mad angry, but mad sad.\n\nHe said if I needed money so much I could have just asked him, I told him I didn't want to be a burden and he said \"stop being ridiculous\". He was heartbroken.\n\nI haven't talked to my uncle in days, and I'm afraid I've dried up the goodwill of the only person who cares about me.

He's upset that he wasn't able to help you before you felt like you had to sell the car to survive. You could use the emotional support if nothing else, and you know he is worried about you.\n\nNAH, and stop letting your dad live rent free in your head.", "NAH... or rather, your dad is clearly the AH\n\nIt was a gift, so yours to do with as you pleased. But it sounds like your uncle just wants to be able to help you, and wants you to realize that you should reach out to him when you need to. Talk to him and sort it out by being honest.", "NAH\n\nI think your uncle was probably upset you didn't reach out before selling the car (because he would have helped you, and because this have gotten this bad for you).\n\nCall him.", "NAH. I get where your uncle is coming from.  Maybe just try to tell him something to the effect that the gift became even more than just a car, it became the vehicle (I just couldn't resist the word play here....) that allowed you to finally escape from your father and you wouldn't have been able to do it without him.", "NTA and I also don\u2019t think your goodwill is dried up with your uncle. He is probably more sad about the fact that your father has treated you horribly to the point that you had to sell the car to survive. Give it a few days and then try to reach out to your uncle again, I\u2019m sure he still loves you and will try to help you however he can.", "NAH. Personally, I can\u2019t imagine that he\u2019s disappointed in you, rather, he seem more disappointed in the situation that your father put you in. If you haven\u2019t reached out to your uncle yet, definitely do to talk about this a bit more and get a better idea of what he\u2019s feeling! If you already have, I hope you hear from him soon!", "NTA\n\nYou used it for years before selling it. It's not like you sold it immediately after receiving it. I think your uncle is more upset at your dad for causing the situation that pushed you to make that decision.", "NTA. You have an uncle Iroh, OP. Reach out to him.", "I don't think he is mad at you. He is mad at your dad and disappointed at the situation. NTA, you made a responsible decision based upon the options you had.", "NTA. It was your car to sell, not your uncle's car.\n\nI don't think your uncle is all that mad at you, either. He's probably worried about you. \n\nTalk to him. I'm sure he's okay.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s mad at you nor disappointed in you, I just think he feels guilty for the situation you are in and for not providing for you or defending you enough. I think he blames himself and cares for you like a son, which gives him so much more pain to know you didn\u2019t feel safe(?) or comfortable relying on his help to move out.\n\nI think you should definitely give him a call and tell him how much you love and appreciate him for even just offering to help out with that. I\u2019m sure he will understand if you open up about how you feel and tell him straight up about your own worries and insecurities.\n\nYou seem like a good kid and I hope all the best in your life going forward.", "Honey, your uncle is upset, because he is a decent person, watching the effects of years of abuse on someone he clearly loves very much. He probably feels a little helpless, because he wants to help you - and he wants you to feel worthy of help. \n\nHe's probably also feeling guilty, because he didn't do more to protect you. \n\nNAH \n\nGood luck to you, and you're worth every bit of the love and assistance your uncle wants to provide.\n\nETD something irrelevant.", "NTA.  Your uncle cares *so* much about you, and he sounds amazing.  His reaction was not at ALL about the car.  If I was in his shoes, I would be upset, but not at you.  I would be sad and mad at myself for not having known how desperate you were earlier and for not having been more proactive in checking in on you so that I could have intervened and helped you out.  I would feel like I had failed because I wasn't there to help when you needed it most.  \n\nPlease call him.  He's probably been beating himself up for days over it.", "NAH\n\nYour uncle is not sad mad bc you sold the car. He is sad mad bc after all he tried to let you know he is a safe space you would see yourself as a burden to him. I think he is sad that you see yourself like this and mad that your dad raised you to think you are a burden to everybody. \n\nJust call him and ask him out for a beer. Then you can talk about it.

Your uncle should rest assured that the money he invested into your car is still benefiting you, but in a way that\u2019s more impactful during this stage of your life (particularly since he\u2019s had some insight into your current living situation). You also made good use of the car for years.", "NAH (except your dad, obviously). \n\nI get where your uncle is coming from, or how I might feel in his position. He probably put more than just money into making sure you got a car that would serve you well, and I imagine it made him happy to know that you were benefiting from his gift. \n\nAnd there's a good possibility that you got less money out of the sale than he spent on the car, or - more to the point - than you'll have to spend to replace it. Asking him for a loan would've likely been the better financial decision for both of you. \n\nNow, that said - sure, he's probably bummed, but you didn't do it to hurt him and he absolutely knows that.\n\nI totally understand not wanting to ask for help when you can sort matters out on your own terms, even if those terms are less than ideal. I'd have done the same, particularly at your age. \n\nYou haven't ruined the relationship. Call him, go see him, or send him a letter (an actual letter - nobody does that shit, it shows you went to some effort and tends to feel more meaningful). Just tell him the truth about why you made the decision you did, apologize if it feels right to do so, and thank him for providing you with the means to land on your feet and escape your horse's ass of a father. \n\nOn a side note: Look, being raised by a hypercritical parent tends to make it very difficult for some of us to ask for help, or trust that it will be given without resentment or obligation if you do. If that's true for you, then just realize that normal people who aren't assholes do like to help the people they love, and want nothing back save for the knowledge that the help they gave you improved your life. And your old man is way, way beyond hypercritical and well into abuse territory. F that dude. Sounds like a real narcissist. \n\nYou're 100% not the asshole here, and I truly doubt your uncle thinks you are, either.", "NTA for selling the car.\nI can empathize with both your uncle\u2019s disappointment and you not wanting to ask for handouts or burden anyone. \n\nI would reach out to him and ask to meet in person. I would apologize for not seeing the now-obvious support system you have in him and explain that you felt desperate and did not feel right burdening others with your current situation. Tell him you appreciate his support and, if he is okay with it, would like to be able to talk with him regularly.", "NAH. Your uncle is a good man, lean on him. He obviously wants to be there for you. \n\nYour dad is the only AH here", "NAH.  please reach out to your uncle.  He probably wants to develop a better avuncular relationship, especially since he knows that your father is not your ally.", "You have a great uncle. Call him and take him out to lunch with some of that extra money. \n\nYou probably should have told him beforehand but you were in quite a predicament. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing better now.", "NTA but I would still apologize to your uncle. He was probably hurt you didn't feel like you could come to him with this problem. He wants to be a real father figure to you including financially... Is that something you're willing to let him do? Be the father he thinks you need? It's ok to say n, if you don't want that but I'd talk to him either way and sort things out. He seems like he'll support and respect you either way.", "NAH.  Reach out to your uncle more often so that when you need his help, you have a line of communication open.  \n\n> A supportive family member is amazing, regardless of whether they are your father, mother, or whomever.  I wish I had one.", "NTA.  Call your uncle and apologize for hurting his feelings.  Explain that his gift helped you when you needed it most and that you will always be grateful to him.  Ask him if there is anything you can do to make it up to him.  Make sure he knows how much he means to you.  He sounds like a good man.  He will come around.", "Man, your uncle is a bit pissed that you did not ask him for help, but he does not think that you did sth wrong per se, but that you can count on him for support\n\nNah for selling the car\n\nHowever, you have a support net that can step in when your failure of a srmen donor fails.", "NAH he wants to give you support, let him", "Nta, he mad at the situation not you. It really sucks that you had to sell the car, and I'm sure your uncle would of loved to give you money before selling it. It's just a sad situation all round. Congrats on getting out of your dads place though", "NTA - you did your best in the circumstances you were in.  Your uncle was upset that he didn't make it clear enough that you could lean on him in these kinds of situations.  \n\nIf you were my niece / nephew, I'd be concerned about the financial consequences of loosing your vehicle.   We want our nieces / nephews to progress in life and if we can help, we do.  \n\nI'm sure your uncle is sorry he was upset and didn't want to make you feel worse.  Call him and have a chat or arrange to meet", "50$ on dad secretly being gay.", "You're a huge asshole", "What does any of this back story about your dad have to do with any of this?", "For real. He's not mad AT you, just the situation. He's probably trying to figure out why you don't think you can go to him for help, not realizing that that's not why you didn't. Give him a call and talk with him, say sorry you sold but you needed to solve a problem and found a way to do that on your own. You're an adult now, solving your own problems when you can isn't a bad thing.", "This ^^^^ you wrote what I wanted to say!\n\nHe\u2019s sad that you didn\u2019t come to him. \n\nHe also understands you\u2019re trying to adult!", "This. NTA for doing what you had to in a difficult time. Sounds like your uncle is upset because he sees what a shit dad you have and he wants to help. I doubt he's upset solely about the car.", "Yep, and also probably feels sad that in being kicked out, OP tried to handle it himself - not reaching out to Unc, not calling him once he had figured out the couch surfing list was running dry. \n\nThis isn't to guilt you if you see this, OP - A LOT of toxic masculinity culture also involves not asking for or needing help, and even more of it is unconscious and needs to be unraveled in minds often dunked or drowned in it.", "Oh man, I never thought about it, but in a way, yeah, he is my uncle Iroh <3, it melts my hearth to think about him as Iroh. I'll reach out tomorrow.", "Agreed. NTA. The uncle loves OP and is just disappointed."]}
