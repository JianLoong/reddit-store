But it sounds like your uncle just wants to be able to help you, and wants you to realize that you should reach out to him when you need to. Talk to him and sort it out by being honest.", "NAH\n\nI think your uncle was probably upset you didn't reach out before selling the car (because he would have helped you, and because this have gotten this bad for you).\n\nCall him.", "NAH. I get where your uncle is coming from.  Maybe just try to tell him something to the effect that the gift became even more than just a car, it became the vehicle (I just couldn't resist the word play here....) that allowed you to finally escape from your father and you wouldn't have been able to do it without him.", "NTA and I also don\u2019t think your goodwill is dried up with your uncle. He is probably more sad about the fact that your father has treated you horribly to the point that you had to sell the car to survive.

Personally, I can\u2019t imagine that he\u2019s disappointed in you, rather, he seem more disappointed in the situation that your father put you in. If you haven\u2019t reached out to your uncle yet, definitely do to talk about this a bit more and get a better idea of what he\u2019s feeling! If you already have, I hope you hear from him soon!", "NTA\n\nYou used it for years before selling it. It's not like you sold it immediately after receiving it. I think your uncle is more upset at your dad for causing the situation that pushed you to make that decision.", "NTA. You have an uncle Iroh, OP. Reach out to him.", "I don't think he is mad at you. He is mad at your dad and disappointed at the situation. NTA, you made a responsible decision based upon the options you had.", "NTA. It was your car to sell, not your uncle's car.\n\nI don't think your uncle is all that mad at you, either. He's probably worried about you. \n\nTalk to him. I'm sure he's okay.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s mad at you nor disappointed in you, I just think he feels guilty for the situation you are in and for not providing for you or defending you enough. I think he blames himself and cares for you like a son, which gives him so much more pain to know you didn\u2019t feel safe(?) or comfortable relying on his help to move out.\n\nI think you should definitely give him a call and tell him how much you love and appreciate him for even just offering to help out with that. I\u2019m sure he will understand if you open up about how you feel and tell him straight up about your own worries and insecurities.\n\nYou seem like a good kid and I hope all the best in your life going forward.", "Honey, your uncle is upset, because he is a decent person, watching the effects of years of abuse on someone he clearly loves very much.

Your uncle cares *so* much about you, and he sounds amazing.  His reaction was not at ALL about the car.  If I was in his shoes, I would be upset, but not at you.  I would be sad and mad at myself for not having known how desperate you were earlier and for not having been more proactive in checking in on you so that I could have intervened and helped you out.

Your uncle should rest assured that the money he invested into your car is still benefiting you, but in a way that\u2019s more impactful during this stage of your life (particularly since he\u2019s had some insight into your current living situation). You also made good use of the car for years.", "NAH (except your dad, obviously). \n\nI get where your uncle is coming from, or how I might feel in his position. He probably put more than just money into making sure you got a car that would serve you well, and I imagine it made him happy to know that you were benefiting from his gift. \n\nAnd there's a good possibility that you got less money out of the sale than he spent on the car, or - more to the point - than you'll have to spend to replace it. Asking him for a loan would've likely been the better financial decision for both of you. \n\nNow, that said - sure, he's probably bummed, but you didn't do it to hurt him and he absolutely knows that.\n\nI totally understand not wanting to ask for help when you can sort matters out on your own terms, even if those terms are less than ideal. I'd have done the same, particularly at your age. \n\nYou haven't ruined the relationship. Call him, go see him, or send him a letter (an actual letter - nobody does that shit, it shows you went to some effort and tends to feel more meaningful). Just tell him the truth about why you made the decision you did, apologize if it feels right to do so, and thank him for providing you with the means to land on your feet and escape your horse's ass of a father. \n\nOn a side note: Look, being raised by a hypercritical parent tends to make it very difficult for some of us to ask for help, or trust that it will be given without resentment or obligation if you do. If that's true for you, then just realize that normal people who aren't assholes do like to help the people they love, and want nothing back save for the knowledge that the help they gave you improved your life. And your old man is way, way beyond hypercritical and well into abuse territory. F that dude. Sounds like a real narcissist. \n\nYou're 100% not the asshole here, and I truly doubt your uncle thinks you are, either.", "NTA for selling the car.\nI can empathize with both your uncle\u2019s disappointment and you not wanting to ask for handouts or burden anyone. \n\nI would reach out to him and ask to meet in person. I would apologize for not seeing the now-obvious support system you have in him and explain that you felt desperate and did not feel right burdening others with your current situation. Tell him you appreciate his support and, if he is okay with it, would like to be able to talk with him regularly.", "NAH. Your uncle is a good man, lean on him. He obviously wants to be there for you. \n\nYour dad is the only AH here", "NAH.  please reach out to your uncle.  He probably wants to develop a better avuncular relationship, especially since he knows that your father is not your ally.", "You have a great uncle. Call him and take him out to lunch with some of that extra money. \n\nYou probably should have told him beforehand but you were in quite a predicament. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing better now.", "NTA but I would still apologize to your uncle. He was probably hurt you didn't feel like you could come to him with this problem. He wants to be a real father figure to you including financially... Is that something you're willing to let him do? Be the father he thinks you need? It's ok to say n, if you don't want that but I'd talk to him either way and sort things out. He seems like he'll support and respect you either way.", "NAH.  Reach out to your uncle more often so that when you need his help, you have a line of communication open.  \n\n> A supportive family member is amazing, regardless of whether they are your father, mother, or whomever.  I wish I had one.", "NTA.  Call your uncle and apologize for hurting his feelings.  Explain that his gift helped you when you needed it most and that you will always be grateful to him.  Ask him if there is anything you can do to make it up to him.  Make sure he knows how much he means to you.  He sounds like a good man.  He will come around.", "Man, your uncle is a bit pissed that you did not ask him for help, but he does not think that you did sth wrong per se, but that you can count on him for support\n\nNah for selling the car\n\nHowever, you have a support net that can step in when your failure of a srmen donor fails.", "NAH he wants to give you support, let him", "Nta, he mad at the situation not you. It really sucks that you had to sell the car, and I'm sure your uncle would of loved to give you money before selling it. It's just a sad situation all round. Congrats on getting out of your dads place though", "NTA - you did your best in the circumstances you were in.  Your uncle was upset that he didn't make it clear enough that you could lean on him in these kinds of situations.  \n\nIf you were my niece / nephew, I'd be concerned about the financial consequences of loosing your vehicle.   We want our nieces / nephews to progress in life and if we can help, we do.  \n\nI'm sure your uncle is sorry he was upset and didn't want to make you feel worse.

He's not mad AT you, just the situation. He's probably trying to figure out why you don't think you can go to him for help, not realizing that that's not why you didn't. Give him a call and talk with him, say sorry you sold but you needed to solve a problem and found a way to do that on your own. You're an adult now, solving your own problems when you can isn't a bad thing.", "This ^^^^ you wrote what I wanted to say!\n\nHe\u2019s sad that you didn\u2019t come to him. \n\nHe also understands you\u2019re trying to adult!", "This. NTA for doing what you had to in a difficult time. Sounds like your uncle is upset because he sees what a shit dad you have and he wants to help. I doubt he's upset solely about the car.", "Yep, and also probably feels sad that in being kicked out, OP tried to handle it himself - not reaching out to Unc, not calling him once he had figured out the couch surfing list was running dry. \n\nThis isn't to guilt you if you see this, OP - A LOT of toxic masculinity culture also involves not asking for or needing help, and even more of it is unconscious and needs to be unraveled in minds often dunked or drowned in it.", "Oh man, I never thought about it, but in a way, yeah, he is my uncle Iroh <3, it melts my hearth to think about him as Iroh. I'll reach out tomorrow.", "Agreed. NTA. The uncle loves OP and is just disappointed.", "NTA. I hope you are in a safe situation and that independent life will be good to you. \n\nYour uncle clearly loves you. Open up to him: at 21, you solved a problem as an adult. You are grateful you had the car as a resource to escape to safety. His gift made that possible.", "NAH (except your dad, obviously)\n\n(I got *really* emotional writing this, so my reply ended up long af for a reply on this sub, and kinda personal. But I also think it's all entirely relevant to this situation. Sorry for length!)\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong in selling the car. It wasn't new when you got it, you used it for 3 years, you'd have needed to sell it eventually anyway, it was *yours* and you needed money.\n\nI agree with some of the other comments saying your uncle probably put a lot of thought into buying the car and that it was a gesture showing his support.\n\nI'm betting he put a lot more thought into this gift than most people would realize. \n\nTo most people, a car is transportation. But I've been in a situation similar to yours, albeit for different reasons. I didn't have the friends with a sofa or the savings, though. So my car ended up being my home for a time while I got through those first few months.\n\nA car is freedom. It's a means of driving away if someone's hurting you. It's shelter if you lose yours. It's a safe place to keep things that you might not feel safe having in the house... especially if the house isn't yours.\n\nYour uncle is likely sad that you don't have that level of freedom anymore. Concerned about how you will get to class or work. What you'll do if you're out somewhere and someone like your dad corners you and you don't feel safe. \n\nI know *I* had those concerns reading your post, and I don't even know you!\n\nAdd to that... hon, not everyone has to sell off their belongings to make ends meet. For people... (compassionate people) who don't have that need... that's barely a step up from homelessness. And even people who've been there... it kinda hurts for people to see you struggling rather than reaching out. It hurts to see, and often you wonder if you could/should have done more to help!\n\n*anecdotal:* I had a neighbor (friendly, not friends) who was elderly and going through a hard time when her husband went in the hospital. Well, we'd had a big meal at my house for my kid's birthday, and I brought over a plate of food to share... not even thinking about it as helping her, we just frankly like sharing food with neighbors because we enjoy cooking,  so gave some to multiple people. Anyway, she got a lil teary eyed but brushed it away, and said thank you, and that she's so tired of eating the same thing every day. I started asking questions and found she'd been eating broken taco shells and ketchup as \"nachos\" all week because that's all the food she had left.\n\nI chided her for not asking for help because... idk why. Honestly it's a weird social convention that shouldn't exist. But I wasn't upset with her. I was angry at myself. Disappointed in myself, that... even with my experience, I hadn't *realized* she was low on food. I hadn't offered to help. I was mad at my cluelessness, lol.\n\nI'm betting that's a lot of what you're reading in your uncle too. He knew you got kicked out, he knew you had a place to stay, and didn't thin about needing money for the apartment. You didn't ask but also he didn't *offer*, and so you struggled and lost the gift of freedom he'd given you years ago. And he likely can't fix that right now. It's a lot harder to get/gift a car than cash, yknow?\n\nI think he's mad at your dad. Sad for you. Frustrated with himself and his inability to *fix* it. And unfortunately, sometimes people project all those feelings onto the wrong person. \n\nAnd I'm sorry you're the one catching the brunt of that in this situation.\n\nYou did *nothing* wrong here. You made a smart financial decision in a tough financial situation. You acted with a lot of intelligence and maturity. And you don't owe anyone an explanation or an apology.\n\nBut it might help your relationship with your uncle if you reached out. Something like, \"hey I'm really sorry that I didn't think to ask you for help\" and then tell him what the car did for you. You used it a lot during those difficult years at home. Probably used it as a way to escape sometimes. I'm assuming it got you to your friends place when you got kicked out and that you probably had to store some stuff in it for awhile. It was kinda a lifesaver, right? And now it's gotten you out of homelessness. Off your friends' sofa. It got you a *home*. Let him know if you're grateful for that. And that you now know how eager he was to show his support, that you know you can come to him if you need help. \n\nBetting he'll be sad *glad* if he hears that. \n\nAgain, it's not your responsibility to mend this, because you did nothing wrong. Just... emotions can be hard to navigate, even when you're older. Might help.", "NTA.", "NTA, call and talk to him he cares about you and only wishes you had called him sooner.", "NTA\nIf this breaks relationship with you over this\nHe has as many issues as your dad", "I sometimes think about it, I mean, my dad is unhinged. \nWhen I started college, I had a classmate who was a red pilled gymbro, and was also very misogynistic. \n\nThen, one of my friend found him at a gay nsfw subreddit, the room on that photo was the same as the room on his IG photos. We said nothing and kept the secret. \n\n2 years later, he was happily in a gay relationship. Is still kind of a prick, but at least he is not pretending to be straight anymore. \n\nAs my uncle says, he is hiding so many insecurities, but since I can't be sure if he is so deep into the closet that became the king of Narnia, I'll just assume is small dick syndrome.", "Thank you so much for sharing your experience. :heart: :heart:", "You're so welcome, of course.
