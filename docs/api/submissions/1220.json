I was so glad because I can't stand when someone is constantly in their phone. I don't know if it's just the comfort level that is now to the point where we don't shy from each other at all, but now that we live together (1 week) I worry he might be addicted to being on on his phone. \n\nNow I want to emphasize I know he isn't doing anything sneaky, anytime he is on his phone, he's watching funny reels on IG, sport highlights, tweets, playing chess, watching YouTube,  reading articles \"tweets\", idk etc etc. He isn't on messaging apps and I know this because I hear it and also sometimes look over because I get curious. But it seems anywhere we are, he literally can't wait to sit down and get on his phone to do something. Anything. It's so strange. Sometimes it makes me feel like whatever is on his phone is more interesting than me. That HURTS because who's to say it isn't true?\n \nSometimes it causes us to run late though because he will wake up and stay in bed on his phone instead of getting up and getting ready, or we'll be making food, eating at home, etc etc. Sometimes we'll be in bed at night (not having sex, just getting ready for sleep) and he'll just be scrolling, and I just lay there, Sometimes he notices though, and reaches over and gives me a kiss or cuddles with me, which I do appreciate. or we'll be having lunch at home or we're making food and he's just scrolling or looking at a video. I don't expect us to be constantly engaged but I truly wonder at what point is it that your phone starts to rob you of your time. \n\nSometimes I will watch him be butt-naked like ready to take a shower and he'll stop to watch a video. Lmao I don't get it? It doesn't interfere with our time together whatsoever, which I also appreciate but I just wish he'd spend his time doing more important, productive things that will pay off rather than reading a Twitter timeline. I get watching funny videos is cool. I do it too, once in a while, but not every hour of the day.. \n\nOne time we were getting ready to go grocery shopping and I saw that he wasn't getting up. I asked him, in a calm manner \"baby are you ready?\" And with a smile he said gimme 2 minutes to finish this chess match. Are you forreal lol? Sometimes I feel like I'm dealing with a teenager man. \n\nIt makes me anxious to see him constantly needing some kind of media stimulation, rather than just being present with me, or more importantly, with himself.  \n\nI don't know if it's just because I hardly find a reason to be constantly on MY phone. I do have social media but I'm very aware how easy it is to just stay glued to it so I make a conscious effort to just be present with myself and those around me, instead of being on my phone. I don't expect us to be constantly engaged but we're still together. \nI don't know, I've never lived w/ a partner so I really don't know how these things are supposed to go but I do like my partners very present with me AND using their time wisely on things.\n\nI want to genuinely help him, bc I used to be the same exact way. Addicted to social media. I realized how triggered it made me, and how easily sucked in I would get. I know he would get so much more done, and our relationship would reap the benefits too. But how do I tell him it's excessive? It also doesn't interfere with our quality time, we literally have scheduled our quality time. And I know nothing will come btwn it. But, it seems his personal time is being robbed by his phone..", "created_utc": 1667578291, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym31oq/aita_for_telling_my_f27_bf_m29_his_phone_habits/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it becomes a huge problem then tell him how you feel about it.

I also play chess and look at reddit, but for this reason I deleted everything else a while ago. Im only here because Im at work and my work is all completed and reviewed for now. Be careful with how you approach this, because the use of the phone is heavily tied to mood, instinct, and attention. Just attacking someones dopamine source will make them bitter and angry. Its not a bad thing to spend some time on it, phones are wonderful, but its a habit thats hard to quit. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nI know my wife and I go through this is cycles. She'll be on her phone then I get on mine from boredom and then she says never talk to her.  I just don't like talking to the back of her phone or having to repeat myself because she's watching a tiktok.\n\nIt's well documented that screen time at bedtime inhibits good sleep.  But it doesn't matter if it is \"unhealthy\" for him, because it is off-putting to you.  I suggest you have a discussion about it and hopefully agree to limits.  No phones in bed is a pretty easy one. No phones at meals.\n\nIf you want to compare and quantify, I believe most phones have a tracking app that tells you how much screen time you've had on what apps each day.  He may be shocked to learn how much time he's spending.", "From strictly a relationship standpoint, it seems that he is not engaged.   That's a problem in itself.   This early in the relationship there should be more interest and intensity.   You might have been suggesting that he is less interested in sex.   If that is so, he might be addicted to the phone.   If he is addicted, it is likely that he will seek more phone time to feed the addiction.   If he is addicted, it will require professional help to end it.   Helping him is not possible by loved ones.   An addict will do anything, say anything to feed the addiction.   Here's hoping that this is a false alarm.  Fair winds and following seas.", ">AITA for telling my (f27) bf (m29) his phone habits might be unhealthy\n\nWell, not really, depending on the--\n\n>because they're different from mine?\n\n...Welp. Let's see where this goes.\n\n>In the beginning of the relationship any time we were together, he was fully present with me and it honestly made me think he wasn't addicted to his phone. I was so glad because I can't stand when someone is constantly in their phone.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the guy at the beginning of a relationship doesn't tend to be the same guy as when the relationship is in full swing, and that's true for you, too. When we're getting to know someone, we're \"on\" around them because we haven't built enough of a connection with them to fully relax and be our truest selves. \n\nAnyway, that aside, I read everything in your post all the way up to this point, which I think is the most important:\n\n>It doesn't interfere with our time together whatsoever, which I also appreciate but I just wish he'd spend his time doing more important, productive things that will pay off rather than reading a Twitter timeline.\n\nAnd that, to me, signals that my instinct from your title may have been on point here. There are pieces of your post that I think need some attention, such as how him being on his phone makes *both* of you late from time to time, and I think there's a worthy conversation in him dialing the screen time down *at certain moments* \\- such as when you're running late, or if you want a little time with him in bed, etc.\n\nBut, and I say this as someone who's a bigtime screen-scroller myself...if it isn't actively interfering in your relationship, you should think long and hard about whether it's a battle you want to pick. \n\nI think part of it is this:\n\n>It makes me anxious to see him constantly needing some kind of media stimulation, rather than just being present with me, or more importantly, with himself.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I have ADHD, and one of the ways that manifests with me is that I can rarely focus on *just one thing* at a time. Heck, I'll be watching TV and pop my phone out to check Reddit and I won't even really be conscious I'm doing it, just because something in me needs a little extra stimulus. \n\nBut while it might not entirely be the healthiest pattern of behaviour, and while I know there are things I need to work on, it's the base foundation of your anxiety that I think you should question a little, because I think you're taking this more personally than you need to.\n\nHim needing stimulation is not a reflection on you, nor should it be taken as an indication that he doesn't value you, or your companionship. Some of us are capable of just *being present* in a moment with nothing going on, and...some of us aren't. That may be an incompatibility with you, and if it is, then that's okay. But that doesn't make it objectively unhealthy or wrong, either.\n\nI'm going to say **NAH** but suggest being careful how this gets brought up. If you feel this is going to be a deal-breaker, that's absolutely okay. But that means it's a deal-breaker *for you*, and the question of whether or not his screen time is healthy needs to be distinct from that.", "NTA - I sincerely hope he is able (and other folks are too) to break this addiction. Marketing giants have gotten most of the world addicted to their phones while they make bank. And all we are left with is a bunch of crap we don\u2019t need (including information) and broken relationships. \nDon\u2019t Look Up also applies (in ways) to this worldwide addiction.", "I think the latter quote would also be valid if, once you have the conversation, his habits don\u2019t change. But before having an initial talk, all your feelings are just in your head, so I\u2019d give him the benefit of the doubt at the jump.
