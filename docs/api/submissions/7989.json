I'm struggling to find any ounce of logic in what your friend is saying to you. Tons of apps ask for your contact list. I hope no one is under any sort of illusion that any app, whether on your phone or a contact, is keeping any of your information private. They're all using it for marketing purposes.\n\nYou are allowed to download a dating app. You are allowed to block your contact list from the app. She's being wildly unreasonable.", "Nta\n\nCould it be hacked and information taken?
