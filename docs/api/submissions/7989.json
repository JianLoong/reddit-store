She has a cell phone and gave you her number. You aren't handing out her number to strangers. You're using it within reason with a social app. It doesn't mean the app is sharing her information illegally.\nShe doesn't have to have a cell phone and she doesn't have to give you her number. But she does have a cell phone and did give you her number.", "She sounds unhinged. She probably had a crush and is unraveling because that excuse was bananas. NTA", "NTA\n\nTbh it sounds like you guys don't share core values, which makes for tough friendships. I'm also reading in between the lines to see that she may be the kind of person who just likes to be mad at people and chooses very small, harmless things to be mad at.", " NTA.   You can\u2019t be expected to notify all your contacts that you are getting tinder and don\u2019t want them to see you have tender so you would like their permission to block them on tender\u2026 so they won\u2019t know you have tender.  \n\nWhat kinda circular logic is that.   Your friend is NTA.  She is, however, the idiot.", "Nta I would just unsaved her number that way her mind is at ease but honestly  that's crazy that she expect you to ask her permission before agreeing to that pretty much any app that you download ask permission to look at your contact list so I would ask her what apps does she have on her phone since she's so concerned about the one that's on yours", "NTA, you might need to hang out less with this friend, if at all she sounds a little unhinged", "NTA. You didn't do anything wrong except relay a completely pointless detail to her for no reason. Never in my life have I told someone about the permissions on an app.", "NTA. Does she not get that anyone who has her number and has blocked contacts has given her number to tinder? Same goes with 100 other apps including other dating apps, tiktok, FB, Instagram, BeReal, and basically anything that allows you to follow or block your friends.", "NTA. I'm struggling to find any ounce of logic in what your friend is saying to you. Tons of apps ask for your contact list. I hope no one is under any sort of illusion that any app, whether on your phone or a contact, is keeping any of your information private. They're all using it for marketing purposes.\n\nYou are allowed to download a dating app. You are allowed to block your contact list from the app. She's being wildly unreasonable.", "Nta\n\nCould it be hacked and information taken? Yes\n\nThe odds of it are slim though. Honestly smartphones or any smart device is a much greater risk.", "NTA, she has no right to tell you to not block contacts on tinder.", "NTA. I have a few friends who are concerned about things like what companies have whose data. I have some of those concerns myself. But it's unreasonable to put the onus on everyone who has her number instead of companies and regulators.  \n\nHonestly, if anyone that has her number saved in their contacts has ever used any of over a dozen dating sites or any of a dozen digital magazine apps, or a dozen travel apps, over a dozen recipe apps, Tinder already had her number.", "NTA, she needs to get a grip.", "NTA she is just wildly controlling. I probably would limit how much I hung out with her tbh", "NTA block her IRL too", "NTA.  If she's so concerned about information privacy, then she shouldn't be giving out her phone number at all.", "NTA. IDK what your friend is upset about, but it's not what they're saying they're upset about", "NTA. Your reaction was a perfectly reasonable reaction to an unreasonable expectation.  If she\u2019s that concerned she needs to keep her own information private.", "Your friend's concerns are legitimate.\n\nBut normal users don't think like CS pros.\n\nShe's the AH for not keeping her cool and explaining it.\n\nShe can contact the app and, depending on her regional laws, have them expunge her personal details.\n\nNTA", "She is being unreasonable but also knowledgeable enough to know how those apps operate. Depending on how the legalese is setup for Tinder, you may have given them all the contacts in your app (by wanting to be blocked by them) and consent for them to market Tinder TO those contacts as well as sell their data to third parties.\n\nNTA for not asking, but her concerns are also quite valid. Those companies do put all kinds of loopholes for them to make money in those agreements that most people just blindly accept.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think it is reasonable to ask friends not to share one's contact number with anyone. I don't think you're an asshole though.", "ESH. \n-\tYes, you obviously have to share numbers to block numbers. It doesn\u2019t take an expert to understand that. \n-\tYes, pretty much everybody volunteers other people\u2019s info when they definitely never asked for permission to do so. Doesn\u2019t make each and everyone of us less of an AH for doing so. \n-\tHowever, since it\u2019s unfortunately pretty normal for people to do this, you friend overreacted and is also an AH.", "Okay so she's not 'wrong', but she's still the AH. Quite frankly, if she's to be that upset; she had no business giving her number out in the first place. Tell her to give her head a shake and to act professionally if this is what her career will center. You are NTA.", "Oh the stuff she said earlier was when I was irritated Tinder had made me swipe on a 29 year old despite me marking my age preference as 20-25 because I'm in that range. She told me my parents have a gap of nine years so I could also date a twenty nine year old. Didn't understand why I was so offended at that comment somehow. I think she's really aroace with no filter.", "She's the sort of person who was angry at a flatmate for having a negative RAT test and not self quarantining in her room, apparently she wanted the flatmate to pay for an actual test and thought everyone would have the same standard. By 'has certain expectations that she thinks everyone else has but actually doesn't, but doesn't say anything about it' I mean that. She's an okay friend, but it's wild when shit like this happens.", "For number and email blocklists, apps *should be hashing the phone list locally on device, and only uploading the hash signatures to protect the details of those contacts never given the opportunity to opt in.\n\nThere's no guarantee they're doing it this way, though.", "You both get really offended easily. It's hard to accept as reality.", "The best indication of future behavior; is past behaviour. This foolishness will continue repeating. Get to higher ground and no more excuses for crazy, controlling, people. Also... Tinder ain't it. Quit while you're ahead.", "I doubt most are doing it unless required by law.", "NTA. Her information is already exposed by having a cell phone. This unfortunately goes along with modern times. She also sounds annoying to deal with.", "NTA she is disturbed in some way and illogical. I think you should start distancing yourself from her as she is not safe to be around, especially if she talks about hacking you.", "Unpopular Opinion, but I have to go NAH...and here's why:\n\nI think this is a miscommunication issue rather than a judgement issue.\n\nYou told your friend about an experience in an app that, if I'm being honest, was completely irrelevant to the situation. I feel like most people, if they read the warning, would do what you did and block contacts. Thus, even bringing it up was a mistake on your part.\n\nAs for your friend, I am pretty sure that she is not thinking along the same lines as you. Your mentioning of the warning probably should've been re-phrased to say that Tinder gives you a practical option to prevent your contacts from finding you on the site. Using the word \"blocked\" typically implies something. She probably thought that when you said that you just \"blocked her\", ...'*You blocked me? I thought we were friends?\",* rather than \"Oh, I just don't get to look at your profile on this literal dating/hook-up app\". Because I think she is thinking of it in terms of any other social platform or like blocking someone's calls, as in meaning you don't like them or don't want them to bother you.\n\nThat being said, if I'm totally off base, then are you sure she isn't like in...into you? As in more than a friend?", " NTA, it\u2019s giving nutjob.", "I'd judge you for refusing to date in your age range, too, tho, lol. You're within 29 but your cut off is 25? She's still the asshole tho", "I'm assuming OP meant they were within the 20-25 age range (which makes sense, seeing as they said they were an arts student and that's generally college age) so that's the age range they'd like to date in", "No OP is saying she\u2019s within the 20-25 range and therefore isnt interested in a 29 year old", "Certainly not. If they did they would miss a marketing opportunity.", "If that's the case then I will rescind my judgement", "Then I'm wrong and I apologize lol"]}
