My husband's older brother \"Scott\" is engaged to his fiance \"Laura.\" I'm in the wedding party, more for numbers/tradition than because we actually have a close relationship. Husband and Scott aren't that close either so I didn't really expect to be BFFs with Laura.\n\nEven though we're not close I agreed to go away for her weekend bachelorette. It was be me, Laura, and the three other bridesmaids. We arrived Thurs and it was supposed to be through Sunday. Once at the house though, there were multiple things that rubbed me the wrong way, for example I said something about my alma mater and other bridesmaid was a little too surprised and said oh I'm confused I thought you didn't work which is true but it's how she said it. I'm a decade younger than the rest of them so there were a multiple condescending jokes there about me not being able to relate to something. On top of that though, tbh, it was just...boring. Her friends were low energy and negative and Laura and her MOH didn't really plan much in advance. I'm a social person I can get along pretty well in new settings but they weren't giving me much to work with.  \n\nMy husband called Friday night (24 hours in) to chat and update me and mentions in passing that Kid2 was upset because he didn't play well at his game that day and they lost. Other than it was business as usual, he said all the typical stuff about the kids missing me. Later in the conversation I said I'm bored, these women don't like me, I'd rather leave and he said then leave, screw it. I said I might leave. But then one of the kids interrupted so we didn't finish the convo. But an hour later I went to Laura and was like oh my kids are having a hard time, Kid2 is having a hard time, I need to home and be there for them. I was vague intentionally. I expected her to not care but again I think for numbers reasons she was annoyed about it.\n\nBut Laura ofc told Scott why I left and it turned into Scott/Laura \"jokingly\" saying to my husband couldn't handle his own kids which struck a nerve with him. Even my MIL called to be like \"what's this I hear about my son not pulling his own weight?\" We blew off Scott/Laura and ofc I told MIL the truth but my husband is hurt and upset and says feels I threw him under the bus. My husband is a much more direct person, if he'd been in my shoes he would have picked a fight after one of the little comments and then left. He would rather I just be confrontational and be honest and tell Laura or let him tell Laura/Scott that I left because the party sucked and I didn't feel welcome. He thinks I threw him and his ability to be a parent under the bus to avoid conflict, which in a way is true but I don't think what I did is that abnormal or unfair. I've reassured him that it really was because I wanted to come home not because I didn't think he could handle the kids or anything like that, but he's still upset.", "created_utc": 1680719021, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ct9ct/aita_for_bailing_on_a_bachelorette_weekend_and/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why would you want to leave angry knowing that you're going to be in their wedding very soon?", "NTA. These are grown ups you\u2019re talking about right? You gave a polite excuse which is what grown folks do in society. So you should have picked a fight like a real housewife? How would that have gone over with the whole family?! Your husband also shouldn\u2019t be so insecure. Of course they said something petty bc they were annoyed. A kid wanting mom isn\u2019t a reflection on dads parenting. Everyone in his family needs to grow up except for you. Clearly age is just a number bc you\u2019re the most mature in the bunch!", "NTA. Half the benefit of being married is having the excuse of wife or husband needs help or is in trouble/sick and I need to bail. You all just need to get on the same page about dealing with people after that by telling them to mind their own business. \n\nAlso, everyone else is TA, because most adults now know the score and realize they have done this to others and so polite people would just roll with it and not make a big deal out of it.", "NTA you used a common half truth to get out of a social engagement you didn't enjoy. \n\nBut his family sounds like gossipy bussybodies!", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe the comments acting like they\u2019ve never made an excuse to get out of something, or that they believe it would be more polite to honestly say the trip sucked, or that you shouldn\u2019t have agreed in the first place. It was a kind offer from technically family, the polite thing to do would be give it a try. But it sounds like they were actively creating a negative environment. The fact that \u201cmy kid is struggling and I need to be there for them\u201d got misunderstood as \u201cmy husband is weak and can\u2019t handle the kids\u201d is so not your fault and honestly kind of ridiculous.", "nta", "Let\u2019s say a kid just wanted his mom - it\u2019s not a reflection on the dad\u2019s ability to handle his kid. I realize this was made up but it\u2019s plausible and it took some twisting to make it insulting to the dad. I vote NTA as it was white lie intended not to hurt the feelings of Laura and her friends. Sadly those very people decided to fuck with it.", "OP never said husband was struggling with kids. NTA", "NTA for me - i don't think saying your kids are having a hard time is throwing your husband under the bus.\n\nYour husband should take the ego hit because he should by now know you're not a direct person like him.\n\nIt's a real big leap to me him thinking you threw him under the bus. Your husband could do everything right, and your kids still need you. That's parenting.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

By saying her kids are having a hard time it does sound like dad can't handle it", "Yep.\nYTA.", "The problem with that definition of \"polite society\" is that the \"polite\" people just have to take shit from others and not say anything back.

He literally wants you to escalate to get out of this instead of using your words. I think polite white lie was the plan bc you\u2019re still in the wedding etc. however you could have gone the route of saying \u201cI\u2019m feeling a little out of place here and like maybe I\u2019m annoying y\u2019all. I get anxious and so I\u2019d feel more comfortable going home early. I\u2019m sorry I hope you can understand\u201d. That would have been more direct without calling them boring and mean. That being said they would still have been mad. White lie: they are annoyed. Direct: they are mad and think you\u2019re making it about you. Husbands version: you get kicked out of the wedding and they go no contact with you. You made the right choice to keep the peace.", "My wife and I don't have kids but when we are at an event together we throw our dogs under the bus HARD when we really want to get out of something by 8 o'clock.

I\u2019ll take all the downvotes anyone wants to give me. The OP was smart to use a polite excuse and if the dad wasn\u2019t such a baby he would have backed her up. Considering he told her to leave and he knows his wife I\u2019m not sure what he expected. Keeping the peace is more important than being honest or making dad look \u201cbad\u201d which I still argue they didn\u2019t do.", "Also sorry but I feel OP\u2019s husband knows her well enough he should have assumed she would use the kid as an excuse. Not everyone is comfortable with confrontation. It\u2019s clear OP isn\u2019t bold like that and I\u2019m not married to her.

I would assume kid had a rough one and wants both parents. This is just silly.\n\nFor your second part someone else mentioned (and I liked and said was a fair point) that she should have honored her commitment and I agree she should have stuck it out. But I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an asshole for giving a polite excuse even though she got caught. I also expect most folks who are commenting would default and do the same thing bc brides can be sensitive and families can be sensitive.", "I get that, but I also understand why the husband isn't thrilled with the way it rebounded on him in this instance.", "That\u2019s a fair point. Again, the stakes are pretty low here, so she probably just should\u2019ve stuck out the weekend. As unpleasant family members go, these women sound annoying but not intolerable.", "Sure but I bet he has no problem doing the same the other way. I\u2019m sure there have been times he\u2019s begged out to hurry home and help with the kids. They have 3. I bet this excuse comes up a lot and even sometimes it\u2019s true!", "For real. Agreed. That would have been best. Sadly though non-confrontational people tend to make things worse for themselves in the long run and this was a prime example."]}
