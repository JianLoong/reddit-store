This happened last month but now I'm starting to worry...\n\nBasically on Valentine's Day, Angel and I decided to go for a nice dinner with our two friends Dan and Lily who are also a couple. People might find this weird but all four of us were super chill and happy to spend the day together, besides Angel and I had also done a few romantic things before the dinner as well, practically spending the whole day together.\n\nAnyway, dinner goes on and we're having fun and to my surprise I found out an old school friend Beth worked as a waitress at the restaurant who was nice enough to discount our meals. Beth chatted with our table a few times, at one point Lily made a comment asking if Beth could let us eat which I didn't feel was nice but it's whatever.\n\nAnyway, dinner ends and I drive us home. Angel asked if she could be dropped off home before dropping our friends home, I wasn't sure why but did anyway and our friends gave each other a kind of knowing look? I dropped them off and Lily made a comment for me to \"have fun\" with a big grin.\n\nI was about to drive back home until I realized I left  my coat at the restaurant. I went to pick it up and as I was going back to my car I saw Beth in the car park crying. I thought to be a good samaritan and went to see if she was alright, she told me her bf broken up with her a week before and seeing all the couples at work got her upset. I offered for her to come back to my place since her shift was over and Angel would likely be tired after our day out so I figured she wouldn't mind.\n\nWhen we got back to mine, I noticed rose petals leading a trail and candles lit, and then I saw Angel dressed in some lingerie in the living room. As soon as she saw Beth her expression changed, she covered up and rushed out of the room. I was stunned, I didn't known what to do or how to react. Angel doesn't really do stuff like that...\n\nIn the end she went to stay with her mother whilst I gave Beth some chocolate to cheer her up. Angel has barely been home since then and I'm.worried our relationship is over.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I just want to clear some things up since people are creating their own scenarios here.\n\n1. Beth and I have never had any sort of intimate or romantic past. I wasn't interested in doing anything with her.\n2. I have ADHD, I forget things, so yes I really did leave my coat by accident. It wasn't some plan to go back to the restaurant.\n3. Due to word limit, I couldn't add a lot. I did speak to Angel, she said she wanted a little alone time and I gave her that.\n4. Angel doesn't live with me, maybe the whole 'drive us home' thing made it look that way. She does have a key for emergencies. But she's barely come by or visited, hence why it feels we've not seen each other since.", "created_utc": 1679262506, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vyvuo/aita_for_helping_an_old_friend_going_through_a/", "score": 159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No heads up at all? \n\nAnd Beth is a grown woman. You knew exactly what you were doing and frankly, so was she.

That right after humiliating your fiancee and watching her leave--at night, on Valentines day--to go to her mothers, you simply went back to focusing on Beth? \n\nAnd why do I have the sneaking suspicion that the chocolate you fed to your not-fiancee was either originally bought by you or for you by Angel?", "YTA.

On Valentine\u2019s Day????\n\nThen when your gf left YOU STILL HUNG OUT WITH BETH? Um no.

I don't even know where to start. Just make the breakup official.

You keep trying to minimize it. You keep trying to say that if the rolls were reversed then you would be okay with it. But you need to think from her perspective, not yours. Imagine how your body conscious long-term girlfriend felt when she created a nice, intimate, sexual surprise for you. And you showed up with another woman. \n\nThere is a time ay place to be nice and kind to people that are feeling bad about their lack of a relationship. Valentine's Day was not the time and your shared apartment was not the place.", "YTA I don\u2019t think your fianc\u00e9 nor Reddit does nor should they believe this white knight story you\u2019re trying to sell.

You have to be kidding?!", "This is the dumbest thing I\u2019ve read today lmao. If I was your gf I would\u2019ve broken up with you on the spot.

It is not your place, and what can you do for her anyway? And did she feel sorry when your fiancee rushed out of the house out of embarrassment? Did she say anything when you REMAINED in the house feeding her chocolate, while your fiancee is upset SOMEWHERE ELSE? You\u2019re a MAJOR, and I repeat, MAJOR asshole. My blood boils reading your post, YTA!!!", "YTA\nI'm having trouble believing that after your gf reacted at the restaurant, you then brought a girl home on Valentine's Day? And you can't figure out what you did wrong? I hope Beth was worth it. It's not about having friends, it was about how you interacted while you were on a date on Valentine's Day, then you brought the same girl home while you're gf was waiting for sexy time. I get you didn't know about the sexy time... but it WAS Valentine's Day. \n\nI have one word for you.... grovel", "YTA. The entire time I was reading your post all I could hear was Antoine Dodson saying \"You are so dumb.\". \n\nMy dude. You really fucked this one. Your fiance planned a sexy surprise on Valentine's day and you brought another woman home. I know there are more details but you really need to let those go and recognize the giant,.obvious error that you made. \n\nIt doesn't matter that you know her, or that your fiance is usually asleep.

It's ok to comfort an old friend, not bring her home with you on Valentine's Day.  Your \"friend\" was already horning in on your date--enough that someone in your party asked her to \"Let us eat\".

The fact that Lily was the only one who mentioned it is irrelevant, I can assure you having someone keep interrupting your meal is downright rude to your date and the other couple.\n\nLets move past the obvious signs that Angel was upto something to the fact that you brought a female that was a stranger to Angel (I\u2019ve heard of many people who are still complete strangers to me) on valentines night.\n\nYou don\u2019t stop when you see the roses trail but continue into the living room with Beth (who is a complete stranger to Angel) where she is standing there in sexy underwear waiting for you.\n\nEven after Angel fled the room you did nothing where you should have said I\u2019m sorry Beth as you can see this isn\u2019t a good time.  Interesting as well that Beth did not choose to leave on her own (me I would have been mortified at interrupting a clearly carefully planned romantic evening no matter how upset I was).\n\nAngel runs to her parents because she is so embarrassed that she cannot face you or Beth (who is still there) AND instead of stopping her or going after her you decide to feed Beth the chocolates that Angel bought for YOU.\n\nSeriously you have the nerve to ask AITA? \ud83e\udd23.\n\nYes YTA and you will be very lucky if Angels embarrassment doesn\u2019t turn to anger and she becomes your ex.\n\nI\u2019m not one for championing breakups but she deserves better than you and your lame excuses!!

You hurt her, and you don't care enough to listen to anyone trying to make you understand how and why.

The point is that you shared YOUR VALENTINES DAY GIFT, the physical representation of your girlfriends love for you, with ANOTHER WOMAN.", "But, you choose to left alone your \"ex\"-fiance (I hope she dumps you) \n\nYou choose Beth over going after your fiance, and left her upset and alone...", "Either way. I read this to my husband and his first question was \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with this guy?\u201d", "You are truly delusional. Every response you make is so off. You are justifying every bad decision you made. Instead of listening to advice and admitting you were wrong, you are doubling down on the idea that you did the right thing. Think again. You need to go to therapy. You have some screwed up principles.  You will be lucky if she decides to give you a second chance. But, I hope she doesn't. You don't treat her right. She deserves better than you.", "Thank you!", "Please stop creating a fanfiction of my life. Angel does know Beth, we were just surprised she worked at the restaurant we had our dinner at.", "No lol. Y'all are twisting it to your liking. OP knew his GF was home LMAO. Nobody said she'd be asleep and nothing he did was trying to hide her. He definitely didn't think this through but he also wasn't sneaking around. He can't control a waitress either besides there were 3 other people there so why was it on OP to stop them? I've had friends as servers and talked. Just because you're insecure doesn't mean everyone is.", "You try to put your behavior on her several times. Dude. I ask again. Why would you ask Beth to come to your place? Why? I\u2019m confused. No actually. I\u2019m not. I really hope Angel has broken up with you at this point.", "I mean text her as in asking if she was okay.", "That makes no sense. Angel asked me to drop her off at home. I knew she'd be there when I got back, I merely thought she'd be getting ready for bed... How could I have possibly snuck that past her? You think I, a man who missed all the signals, is that clever to sneak another woman under my fianc\u00e9es nose?", "I've got autistic friends who read social cues better than this guy.", "She has guy friends and I completely trust her with them, so I'm not sure what your point is?", "Not sure if you're being insulting or not.", "I reached out to her. She wanted to be alone.", "I'm certain I don't need therapy.", "I don't think his intention was to cheat, I just think he was an idiot who is now single, however, he does say in comments that he thought his GF was going to be asleep. I do also think both of the women involved probably think his intention was to cheat.", "She wasn't okay. That was obvious from the way she fled the room.", "bloody hell", "Your edit about \u201cdriving us home\u201d is insanely confusing then, it makes it sound like since you don\u2019t live together that meant you dropped her off at her home. Either way what you did was inappropriate.", "I really hope she leaves you and you grow some brain cells.", "A guy friend you don't know though?", "Because it was Valentine's day and instead of ending the day with your partner you brought home a friend without a heads up. That's pretty blatant rejection on a day when *most* couples try to do something together. \n\nCOMMUNICATE. WITH. YOUR. FIANCEE. BEFORE. BRINGING. HOME. SOMEONE. SHE. DOESN'T. KNOW. WHEN. YOU. KNOW. SHE'S. HOME. \n\n It doesn't matter that you thought she was heading to bed, shoot her a text at bare minimum. If nothing else she might not want to walk around in her jammies in front of a stranger if she decides she wants a glass of water. \n\nNobody likes to be surprised by strangers in their home. You really disrespected her when you decided to not even give a, \"hey, so and so is coming over\" text.", "Ohhhhh yes you do buddy. If for no other reason than you are getting the same feedback from everyone and still arguing about how you were right.\n\nDid you want true feedback or did you just want an echo chamber because you seem to be taking NOTHING people are saying to heart.", "I can't assume what either woman.thought but, especially the gf, I doubt had thoughts of him cheating. He literally brought her back to their home knowing she was there (whether she was asleep or not). He says somewhere she was just embarrassed being seen/surprised like that. I just think he didn't think anything of it because that isn't the guy he is. As for Beth I don't honestly know but she most definitely should have immediately left and not hung around that's what makes me suspicious about her but OP I think was just a little dense to the big picture and was trying to help a friend.", "Oh my god, I wasn't going to cheat! I've literally gone to bed when Angel has her own friends over, but do I think she's having an orgy in our living room whilst I'm asleep?! No.\n\nThese accusations are beyond ridiculous.", "I say home because it's my home and I dropped her off there at her request. We don't live together, but she does stay over often.", "I've told her about Beth before, I just didn't know she worked at the restaurant.", "No, I just know I don't need therapy. I know reddit is notorious for being self-appointed therapists but I definitely don't need therapy for this.", "Thank you for being a voice of reason.", "I know you weren't. You honestly just seem to not think things through. \n\nBut look at it through the other perspectives. Angel is waiting for you, and you come home later than she was expecting you to with the waitress who was flirting with you all night and when she is understandably upset and leaves you don't go after her, you just stay at the house with the waitress.\n\nAnd Beth, she's upset from being surrounded by couples all night after a break up. She runs into a friend who she had been chatting with earlier who was there on a double date, and now he is offering for her to go back to his house for a while to cheer up. I'm sure somewhere in the back of her mind she was thinking it could lead to something. And then when Angel went running from the house and you stayed with Beth and gave her valentines chocolates that were meant as a gift, what do you think that is saying to her about how much you value your relationship?", "I have a genuine question for you. Have you reached out to apologize to Angel? Or did you just expect the whole thing to blow over? And if you did apologize, when did you? Did you immediately try to contact her after she left to grovel and give the most heartfelt apology of your life, or did you just say \"sorry you were embarrassed \" when she came home.", "She was staying over and you brought another person home? Come on buddy - you can\u2019t be that dense", "At this point you\u2019re just choosing to be dense. You know you\u2019re wrong", "That doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t know her, I don\u2019t understand how you don\u2019t get this. Beth is still a stranger to your gf. And the main problem is not what happened at the restaurant, but you bringing her to your house without checking with your gf first.", "Knowing she exists and knowing her aren't remotely the same. \n\n\nStop being obtuse.", "Dude, you need social skills training if nothing else.", "If you have ADHD, you should realistically need therapy. Even if you claim you don\u2019t need it for this (which I disagree with) you do need it for disorder management. The first thing I was told when I was diagnosed was that I need to set up appointments with a therapist so I could learn to cope better than I had been (which looking at this, you need, even if you believe you\u2019re good right now, imagine if you could do even better)", "Honestly, that would be a bit insane for Beth to think I was offering something more when she'd just seen me out to dinner with my fiancee :/ Plus, I wouldn't take advantage of a vulnerable woman.\n\nI honestly didn't see it as flirting, I don't pick up on things like most people do  but it mainly was just asking how I was and such, not complimenting me in any way, shape or form.", "I did reach out, she just said she wanted some time to herself and I'm trying not to pester her so much.", "Exactly this guy is an idiot", "Did you introduce her to Beth as your fiancee?\nAlso, I'm not saying she was for sure flirting, but just regular friendly conversation, especially if she wasn't even your waitress and she kept coming over, can seem like flirting to an outside party.", "But did you apologise?"]}
