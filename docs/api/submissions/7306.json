You can\u2019t possibly be using them for their money if you just ou for your own items. In effect by splitting the bill evenly if you eat/drink less costly stuff, they are using you for your money.", "NTA , never agree to splitting the bill evenly unless you are all sharing , because some people eat more than others and order more expensive things :/ totally not worth it in a big group setting", "NTA. If splitting the bill means that you are paying for any of their share, then they are using you. You're definitely not using them if you're paying your share.", "NTA - It\u2019s actually the opposite, they\u2019re using you for your money.", "NTA how are you using them for their money if you paid for everything you had. I never get why people split the bill when it's unfair", "NTA. Not sure why they're seeing it as a problem since you're paying for what you're eating. Sounds like they want steak on pizza budget.", "NTA. You've offered to pay your share, so how is that using them for their money, when they will not be paying for you? In fact they are the ones being selfish and using you for your money, by expecting you to subsidise them.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re asking to pay for what you eat/drink. Just get a separate check at the outset and there won\u2019t be drama.", "If you get a separate check then I do not understand how that could be construed as \u201cusing them for their money.\u201d  Living within your means is mature and responsible.  NTA", "NTA.  You probably should only hang out with decent people going forward.", "NTA-How would you be using them for money when you\u2019re literally paying for your own meal Lmao?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It seems like they are just upset that you\u2019re not willing to help pay for their more expensive items.", "NTA actual friends wouldn't have had an issue with you just paying for your own items.", "NTA.

They are the ones using you for your money, they don't even care about your situation, they just care about the amount of drinks they can get... \n\nNTA and find better friends to spend your time with !", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong with only paying for your own.

How is me paying for myself using you for your money? Have you ever heard of the term projecting?\"", "NTA. Splitting the bill equally is so dumb. I always just pay for what I spent. If I spent less than the average of the group, why should I pay for others? Paying for yourself is perfectly fine. Your friends are being dumb.", "NTA,  sorry but how on god earth are you using them for their Money. \n\nWhen you are covering the costs of what you eat and drink. The reality is that you going out with them means you don't mooch and force someone who eats and drinks less to pay your way.\n\nAre your friends IQ less then average??", "NTA", "NTA.  That makes no sense.  You're using them for their money...by paying for your own things?  How is that selfish, in any sense of the word?  Consider getting better friends.", "NTA - you aren't using them for their money, because you are paying for 100% of your meal. They're just angry because you have been subsidizing their meals, which was a sweet deal, and now you are setting boundaries against their selfish behavior. It's projection.", "NTA, you were up front and everyone paying for their own meals is the most fair way of paying anyway. But if you're so broke, why go out to eat and over pay on meals and drinks? I've been in a shitty financial situation the last 5 or so years and in that 5 years I've eaten out a grand total of around 4 times lol", "Being selfish using them for money by paying only or what you consume? Yeeaaahhh that\u2019s not how it works. NTA", "NTA how the f\\*\\*\\* is paying your own way being selfish?  You need to thoroughly examine those credit bills and see how much they've been stiffing you with.", "NTA - sounds as if they are already not paying their full share.  When you order can you make sure the server knows your portion is on a separate bill, which will avoid the conflict of taking just your share out of it - and they can happily split the other bill", "NTA.  Separate tabs/checks.  This solves everything.", "NTA I always try to pay for myself when I go out to eat unless my friends offer to pay for me. Even then I get something cheap and if I want extras, I ask to make sure it's okay first, if not, then no. Recently my best friend wanted to go out to eat and asked if I would go with her, she paid for me. It was for a salad bar/buffet and the only extra I got was pretzel bites that I shared with her.", "When my friend tells me something like this I pull them aside, not in front of everyone and tell them \"I've got it, save your money until you  get back on your feet\" your not the asshole they are.", "YTA. You need to stay home.", "Exactly \ud83d\udcaf  what I wrote. These friends are a few Fries \ud83c\udf5f short of a happy meal", "Legit. This has to be fake haha. It makes no sense.", "It's just classic projection, and these \"friends\" have the self-awareness of a door knob."]}
