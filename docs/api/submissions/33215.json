She had to go through a lot of treatments to get this so it is clearly a big deal for us all. Charlotte acknowledged it by congratulating and asking how far along she was, how she was feeling, if she had any special plans she could help with, etc. But the conversation died around 20 minutes later.\n\nSarah came into the kitchen to 'help' but what she really did was to complain about how self-centered Charlotte is since she didn't let anyone take in the news of her being pregnant.

She said everyone was ignoring her news.\n\nI merely told her she was emotional and overreacting and that Charlotte was just trying to be a good hostess.

I\u2019m only asking because of the wording your sisters comment and also your emphasis on how your wife is a great hostess with stories and talking to people. I mean that\u2019s usually just basic socializing and small talk and shouldn\u2019t stand out all that much. You mentioning it so heavily made me wonder if she tends to \u201cguide\u201d conversations along because that might be interpreted as being overbearing or controlling conversation.", "It sounds like your sister might have been imagining how everyone would react to this news, that is obviously huge for her (especially if she's been going through treatments). She said that Charlotte didn't let anyone take in the news: maybe Charlotte was so busy asking questions and hostessing that she really didn't let anyone absorb the news and give your sister that big reaction she'd been looking forward to. I don't think wanting that reaction makes your sister narcissistic. It's not easy trying to conceive without success for so long, and it makes sense that she may have been looking for a display of joy from her family that was overtaken by (what sounds like) a series of interview type questions by Charlotte.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur sister is an AH - she shpuld host her own events for her announcements. OF COURSE hosting your guests is MORE important than her announcement to you and your wife.", "ESH, not because you were \\*wrong\\* necessarily, but because no one in the history of ever has reacted well to being told they're emotional and overreacting.  Like...what did you expect her to do when you said that, agree with you??", "There is quite a bit of 'missing missing'.  You estimate that the entire conversation regarding a pregnancy announcement was 20 minutes.  This sister had conceived after quite a bit of trying and she's 40 years old.  This is pretty big news, and a very happy announcement.  Did you not have champagne or sparkling apple juice you could have opened to help her celebrate the happy announcement?   Is it possible that yours is a subjective estimate (about the 20 minute conversation) and the actual length of the conversation around the pregnancy could have been shorter?  As described it did not sound like a conversation. . . it sounded like a few questions were directed at Sarah, and then Charlotte decided it was time to move the conversation to other topics.   In her perceived role as 'MC' of the Christmas party, Charlotte sounds a tad controlling, and although you may be amazed at your wife's social skills - the possibility exists that other people do not have the same impression .  At a relaxed party - multiple people should (ideally) be involved in a lively conversation, and a hostess would only intervene if there's an awkward silence.  The guests should go home thinking they had lively and fun conversation - not that they were grilled by someone who did not want to cede the floor.", "NTA. Your sister is probably just a big narcissist with loads of crap in her pants and she was expecting that the rest of the night would revolve around her and her pregnancy.", "NTA\u2026but let me say this: I\u2019ve been under those treatments and they really, REALLY fuck with both body and emotions. It\u2019s horrible, exhausting, honestly I felt awful all the time. I looked and felt more bloated and gross when I\u2019d been doing the meds etc to get pregnant than I did at 40 weeks of pregnancy once the treatment finally worked. It\u2019s an explanation, not an excuse. \nEdited for my accidental grammar issue;)", "NTA. I know that calling her hormonal is stereotypically bad, but that was far gentler that ascribing it to a narcissistic need for the rest of the dinner to be exclusively about her.", "Did your sister think everyone should be talking about her pregnancy for the rest of the evening, like exclusively?  How much is there to say?  I mean, however pleased people are, at some point they\u2019re going to want to talk about other things - I get that to your sister this is now the only topic she can fit in her head, it\u2019s obviously really important to HER, but unless a) really hormonal or b) really narcissistic she ought to understand other people will not only want to talk about it.  \n\nNTA!", "NTA\n\nSound like sis was expecting the rest of the night to revolve around her and her pregnancy, which I get since she's been trying for so long so its extra special to her, but it sounds like everyone gave a courteous response and got on with the festivities which is fair enough.", "There has been a few opinions thrown out here- is your sister a narcissist, is she emotional, is your wife over bearing.? And the answer is probably to some extent partially all of the above. Sounds like she has been waiting for this moment for a while and through the heartbreak has been building it up to something that was not realistic.  Also she probably wanted her own family to have the reaction your wife did. So having that space be occupied by her in law and not her own sister or mother was disappointing. Maybe its worth having a more open and understanding conversation now that you both are removed from the event. Because she also needs to realise that hosting is stressful and the length of time spent on her news was appropriate.", "NTA. What did se expect? Everyone focusing on her pregnancy for the rest of the evening?

Everyone reacted to the news appropriately.  You even say it was discussed for 20 minutes. It's not reasonable to expect it to be the only topic of conversation for the rest of the night.

What does she want you to do, throw an impromptu baby shower at an event that is already happening? It might have been a little rude of you to call her emotional, but it was out of line for her to criticize your wife. Also, 20 minutes is a ton of time to be the center of attention. If she expected more, she could have hosted her own event and made the announcement there.", "NTA. It sounds like the news was more important to your sister than the rest of the family because of all that she had to go through to finally get pregnant. She thought that you all would be just as excited as she was to make her moment bigger. Everyone acted appropriately for the situation but in your sister's eyes, it wasn't enough. Hopefully, in a few days, she will realize that you all do care and are happy for her.", "NTA. She expected everyone to forget about the early Christmas party (that your mom asked you for, btw) and talk about her and her pregnancy the whole night. I mean, yeah, it is a big deal, but how much time can someone talk about it when the event wasn't the focus of her announcement in the first place. I say give her some time to cool off and maybe plan something for her as a surprise, maybe? It's not unreasonable to think her pregnancy hormones are a factor in why she acted that way and telling her she's overreacting due to hormones wasn't helping it either, even if it was true.", "NTA.  Seems like she got a fairly normal response to her announcement.", "NTA \n\nLook, I get it. As a pregnant woman, being told again and again that one is just being emotional and hormonal can becoming very frustrating.

As a hostess, she has to entertain everyone, not just Sarah.", "NTA\u2026 of course Im taking you at your word that you and your family are thrilled for her but there also might be an underlying cautious optimism (understandable) given her difficulties in getting pregnant while she may believe that her feeling slighted as a result of the change in hormones would also not be out of the realm of possibility, I don\u2019t think it is appropriate to tell her much\u2026 \n\nWhile I do think she is making a whole lotta haste out of the collective response, she is prob consumed with so many emotions and so she seems to have an expectation that everyone disregard whatever and whomever has secondary news. Just try to keep listening to her and don\u2019t take it so personally (it may be very hard but she prob doesn\u2019t realize how grating her criticism can be).\n\njust keep offering her support and let her know you and your wife want to everything you can to ensure she has a healthy and happy pregnancy", "NTA So sorry people weren't falling all over your sister with happiness.

Your wife was polite to give her even \u201c20\u201dmin asking and showing interest in your sister pregnancy.

The world does not revolve around you once you\u2019re pregnant.", "NTA.  If she wanted an event ALL about her pregancy that was going to go a certain way she could have set that up.  This is how normal pregnancy annoucements at a family gathering go.  Excitement and discussion and then back to family get together.

She wanted the night to be about her. She's not mother material.", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like people responded appropriately and were very happy for her, but for whatever reason your sister felt that it ought to be a whole night celebration where everyone only talks about her pregnancy. \n\nI personally have never struggled with fertility, but I know people who have and I can only imagine what it must be like to go through. All the medications, shots, etc that go into it to may or may not get pregnant. Someone I know recently went through a loss for their first round.

I had one pregnancy that was normal and two where my hormones were out of control and I was an absolute wreck and emotionally irrational until the last trimester. It\u2019s different for everyone.

She\u2019s entitled, not emotional. The number of times you\u2019ve been pregnant or even if you\u2019re a man or a woman is irrelevant. Maybe you were emotional and acted like that while pregnant?

She had this big idea of what her announcement was going to be like and because she wasn't fawned over and had women cry-screaming she was displeased and took it out on the person she feels inadequate in comparison to. Your wife. My friends sister does the same thing to me any time she's around. Makes remarks or comments that are rude and meant to make me look bad but it only makes her look sad. You don't have to but you could maybe see about family throwing her a little shower or taking her out to eat and giving her some undivided attention. It was rude of her to do an announcement at someone's holiday party but I guess some people just don't understand etiquette. Either way, if you want to salvage the relationship, it would be kind of you to do so.", "NTA. Sorry, but I\u2019ve had multiple kids, and emotions can feel bigger while pregnant. (Then we end up doing stuff like crying over commercials and crap.) I get that this is huge news, but people are only going to talk about it for so long. You announce you\u2019re pregnant, and it\u2019s great and exciting, but people will move on to other topics. WTF was she wanting? People to be rubbing her abdomen? Repeated blow by blows of how much she\u2019s nauseous and are the little feelings she\u2019s felt in her abdomen actually the baby or just gas? What the plans are if the baby is a boy or a girl?

Yes, a pregnancy announcement is exciting but there\u2019s only so much to talk about that early on.", "I guess she was expecting a three hour, prime time-style sit down interview about every waking second.

There is only so much you can talk about with a pregnancy, especially at early stages.", "Right? This is so bizarre to me.  There\u2019s not that much to talk about.  I\u2019ve had two kids.  What are you going to talk about?  Analyze names for hours (bad idea to discuss that with family anyway)?  Talk about hemmeroids and episiotomies?  C sections?  How you may pee when you sneeze after having kids?  Go join a pregnancy group or something.

I'd be interested in hearing sister's side of this. I thought it was weird how OP mentioned her wife \"tells stories to keep everyone entertained\" ...sounds like a lot of the attention is on the host.

As for Sarah, she was being a jerk, but I feel that OP could have said so many other things to make this situation better. Saying 'hey, don't go after Charlotte like that!' would have been better. \n\nFor all the people saying that she is probably hormonal for being pregnant; I agree. But I think OP's use of 'overreacting and overemotional ' is also mental practice to ignore women (and teach them to ignore themselves) when their emotions and reactions are telling them there is something wrong.", "She has main character syndrome.

It\u2019s not universal of course so I agree it is possible that things genuinely petered out, but it does seem odd that their mom only had 20 minutes of shared group interest in a pretty big announcement from her daughter. Especially when that 20 minutes was inclusive of individual inquiries from Charlotte about her, personally, helping and her asking about plans. Really would\u2019ve expected the mom to be the source of those questions as the closer relative. But you know, we all bring our personal experiences into things.

If OP and sister's mom wanted to go on about it even more she could have gone and sat with sister and chatter about baby stuff the rest of the night....... but she didn't. No one was stopping anyone else from doing the same either. Charlotte is guiding the larger group conversation, but in big parties, you often have smaller groups of 2-3 ppl breaking off to chat about whatever else. \n\nI'm of the same opinion of what others have said.

It's still not a good thing to say to anyone and I think it's especially damaging to women. Even if it is wielded by a woman.", "You told her she was emotional and overreacting.  If a man had said that to her, this entire thread would be about how insensitive men are.  It's the exact same with you.  You were entirely dismissive with the oh, little woman is just hormonal, of course she's emotional.  I don't care how many times you've been pregnant. Charlotte sounds a bit like a micromanager.  Now it's time to talk about X; now we've talked about X and we'll move on to Y.  Your sister is demanding more attention than others want to give.  I understand how excited she is, but she can't expect other people to live up to her emotional involvement.  ESH.", "Esh.\n\nYour Sister overreacted. I dont know if your wife had actually ruled the conversation too much. I can't tell.\nBut nevertheless your Sister was disappointed about her great reveal didnt go as planned. Although she is totally in the wrong for bitching to you like that and accusing you wife, I think it is still not okay for you to invalidate her feelings by saying it's due to pregnancy hormones. Although I'm not saying I would have reacted any different myself, but it is really is not nice to dismiss someones feelings like that, just because you think they are not justified in your book.
