She had to go through a lot of treatments to get this so it is clearly a big deal for us all.

It sounds like people responded appropriately, asked questions and showed interest for a period of time until the topic inevitably changed. Did she expect that no other topics would be discussed after her announcement? I mean how much is there to ask about a new pregnancy?

The rest of the night to be solely focused on her pregnancy?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou should consider the possibility that perhaps she wasn't emotional because of pregnancy,  but she's just a really narcissistic person? Does that interpretation make her feel better?", "INFO: Did your wife give space to other people to ask questions or be involved directly with your sister without her talking? I\u2019m only asking because of the wording your sisters comment and also your emphasis on how your wife is a great hostess with stories and talking to people. I mean that\u2019s usually just basic socializing and small talk and shouldn\u2019t stand out all that much. You mentioning it so heavily made me wonder if she tends to \u201cguide\u201d conversations along because that might be interpreted as being overbearing or controlling conversation.", "It sounds like your sister might have been imagining how everyone would react to this news, that is obviously huge for her (especially if she's been going through treatments). She said that Charlotte didn't let anyone take in the news: maybe Charlotte was so busy asking questions and hostessing that she really didn't let anyone absorb the news and give your sister that big reaction she'd been looking forward to. I don't think wanting that reaction makes your sister narcissistic. It's not easy trying to conceive without success for so long, and it makes sense that she may have been looking for a display of joy from her family that was overtaken by (what sounds like) a series of interview type questions by Charlotte.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur sister is an AH - she shpuld host her own events for her announcements. OF COURSE hosting your guests is MORE important than her announcement to you and your wife.", "ESH, not because you were \\*wrong\\* necessarily, but because no one in the history of ever has reacted well to being told they're emotional and overreacting.  Like...what did you expect her to do when you said that, agree with you??", "There is quite a bit of 'missing missing'.  You estimate that the entire conversation regarding a pregnancy announcement was 20 minutes.  This sister had conceived after quite a bit of trying and she's 40 years old.  This is pretty big news, and a very happy announcement.  Did you not have champagne or sparkling apple juice you could have opened to help her celebrate the happy announcement?   Is it possible that yours is a subjective estimate (about the 20 minute conversation) and the actual length of the conversation around the pregnancy could have been shorter?  As described it did not sound like a conversation. . . it sounded like a few questions were directed at Sarah, and then Charlotte decided it was time to move the conversation to other topics.   In her perceived role as 'MC' of the Christmas party, Charlotte sounds a tad controlling, and although you may be amazed at your wife's social skills - the possibility exists that other people do not have the same impression .  At a relaxed party - multiple people should (ideally) be involved in a lively conversation, and a hostess would only intervene if there's an awkward silence.  The guests should go home thinking they had lively and fun conversation - not that they were grilled by someone who did not want to cede the floor.", "NTA. Your sister is probably just a big narcissist with loads of crap in her pants and she was expecting that the rest of the night would revolve around her and her pregnancy.", "NTA\u2026but let me say this: I\u2019ve been under those treatments and they really, REALLY fuck with both body and emotions. It\u2019s horrible, exhausting, honestly I felt awful all the time. I looked and felt more bloated and gross when I\u2019d been doing the meds etc to get pregnant than I did at 40 weeks of pregnancy once the treatment finally worked. It\u2019s an explanation, not an excuse. \nEdited for my accidental grammar issue;)", "NTA. I know that calling her hormonal is stereotypically bad, but that was far gentler that ascribing it to a narcissistic need for the rest of the dinner to be exclusively about her.", "Did your sister think everyone should be talking about her pregnancy for the rest of the evening, like exclusively?  How much is there to say?  I mean, however pleased people are, at some point they\u2019re going to want to talk about other things - I get that to your sister this is now the only topic she can fit in her head, it\u2019s obviously really important to HER, but unless a) really hormonal or b) really narcissistic she ought to understand other people will not only want to talk about it.  \n\nNTA!", "NTA\n\nSound like sis was expecting the rest of the night to revolve around her and her pregnancy, which I get since she's been trying for so long so its extra special to her, but it sounds like everyone gave a courteous response and got on with the festivities which is fair enough.", "There has been a few opinions thrown out here- is your sister a narcissist, is she emotional, is your wife over bearing.? And the answer is probably to some extent partially all of the above. Sounds like she has been waiting for this moment for a while and through the heartbreak has been building it up to something that was not realistic.  Also she probably wanted her own family to have the reaction your wife did. So having that space be occupied by her in law and not her own sister or mother was disappointing. Maybe its worth having a more open and understanding conversation now that you both are removed from the event. Because she also needs to realise that hosting is stressful and the length of time spent on her news was appropriate.", "NTA. What did se expect? Everyone focusing on her pregnancy for the rest of the evening? Either she is hormonal or just plain narcissistic craving for attention.", "Sounds like the expected dramatics and got a basic \u201cgood for you\u201d that\u2019s on her for having too high of expectations.

Feels like the unsaid is, how are going to make it on your own? I\u2019m wondering why your family wasn\u2019t more enthusiastic at the announcement.

Everyone reacted to the news appropriately.  You even say it was discussed for 20 minutes. It's not reasonable to expect it to be the only topic of conversation for the rest of the night. It wasn't even a shower, it was a party. Her pregnancy will never be  the center of everyone else's universe as it is to her. I hope she accepts that soon or the next nine months are going to be a nightmare for the whole family.", "ESH.\n\nSarah seems to have been hoping that her announcement would be the center of the party, and was disappointed that it wasn\u2019t.\n\nBut c\u2019mon\u2026\u201dmerely\u201d telling her that she\u2019s emotional and overreacting just added fuel to the fire.

What does she want you to do, throw an impromptu baby shower at an event that is already happening? It might have been a little rude of you to call her emotional, but it was out of line for her to criticize your wife. Also, 20 minutes is a ton of time to be the center of attention. If she expected more, she could have hosted her own event and made the announcement there.", "NTA. It sounds like the news was more important to your sister than the rest of the family because of all that she had to go through to finally get pregnant. She thought that you all would be just as excited as she was to make her moment bigger. Everyone acted appropriately for the situation but in your sister's eyes, it wasn't enough. Hopefully, in a few days, she will realize that you all do care and are happy for her.", "NTA. She expected everyone to forget about the early Christmas party (that your mom asked you for, btw) and talk about her and her pregnancy the whole night. I mean, yeah, it is a big deal, but how much time can someone talk about it when the event wasn't the focus of her announcement in the first place. I say give her some time to cool off and maybe plan something for her as a surprise, maybe? It's not unreasonable to think her pregnancy hormones are a factor in why she acted that way and telling her she's overreacting due to hormones wasn't helping it either, even if it was true.", "NTA.  Seems like she got a fairly normal response to her announcement.", "NTA \n\nLook, I get it. As a pregnant woman, being told again and again that one is just being emotional and hormonal can becoming very frustrating. But what did she expect, that everyone fall to the floor crying with happiness? And how is Charlotte at fault if all people congratulated her and then moved on to another topic? As a hostess, she has to entertain everyone, not just Sarah.", "NTA\u2026 of course Im taking you at your word that you and your family are thrilled for her but there also might be an underlying cautious optimism (understandable) given her difficulties in getting pregnant while she may believe that her feeling slighted as a result of the change in hormones would also not be out of the realm of possibility, I don\u2019t think it is appropriate to tell her much\u2026 \n\nWhile I do think she is making a whole lotta haste out of the collective response, she is prob consumed with so many emotions and so she seems to have an expectation that everyone disregard whatever and whomever has secondary news. Just try to keep listening to her and don\u2019t take it so personally (it may be very hard but she prob doesn\u2019t realize how grating her criticism can be).\n\njust keep offering her support and let her know you and your wife want to everything you can to ensure she has a healthy and happy pregnancy", "NTA So sorry people weren't falling all over your sister with happiness.  What you expect and what you get are pretty much always two different things. Maybe she was expecting balloons and a marching band and told how wonderful she was. You can't control other peoples responses.", "NTA. It was a Christmas party that you\u2019re hosting.\n And that\u2019s why everyone was there.  Your wife was polite to give her even \u201c20\u201dmin asking and showing interest in your sister pregnancy. If Sarah wanted more attention from people than perhaps she should have host a Pregnancy announcement party and not try to hijack someone else.  The world does not revolve around you once you\u2019re pregnant.", "NTA.  If she wanted an event ALL about her pregancy that was going to go a certain way she could have set that up.  This is how normal pregnancy annoucements at a family gathering go.  Excitement and discussion and then back to family get together.

Sounds like your sister has Main Character Syndrome, just wait until the gender reveal, baby shower, birth, etc.", "NTA. I think that sometimes people forget that they're not the centre of everyone else's world lol", "NTA. I think your sister wanted all the attention on her for the rest of the dinner but you said at the very beginning that your mother has a health issue, and that the dinner was to be done before christmas, so I guess it's an important health issue. And it was a christmas dinner. So many reasons for people to chat about som many things and not only your sister's pregnancy ! I mean, it wasn't HER dinner...", "NTA, she was mad that she didnt highjack the celebration to turn into a free pregnancy announcement party and thought everyone should have spent the evening doting on her.", "NTA. She wanted the night to be about her. She's not mother material.", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like people responded appropriately and were very happy for her, but for whatever reason your sister felt that it ought to be a whole night celebration where everyone only talks about her pregnancy. \n\nI personally have never struggled with fertility, but I know people who have and I can only imagine what it must be like to go through. All the medications, shots, etc that go into it to may or may not get pregnant. Someone I know recently went through a loss for their first round. It is definitely a lot, so I understand that perhaps she felt like people should be more excited and jumping up and down for joy because of how difficult it has been for them. However, it sounds like people were happy. \n\nDoes your sister have other issues with your wife? It seems like perhaps your sister may have had some problems in the past because this just seems like a random thing to get frustrated over. I agree, I do think she is being a bit emotional because  well...it's an emotional time.", "NTA but please don\u2019t tell pregnant women they are emotional and overreacting. I had one pregnancy that was normal and two where my hormones were out of control and I was an absolute wreck and emotionally irrational until the last trimester. It\u2019s different for everyone. This is a huge thing for her and she probably had expectations that everyone would be insanely excited and want to talk about it all the time like she does right now.", "ESH. She\u2019s entitled, not emotional. The number of times you\u2019ve been pregnant or even if you\u2019re a man or a woman is irrelevant. Maybe you were emotional and acted like that while pregnant? Anyway I\u2019ve met many pregnant women and they were all nice and normal. Your sister is just self-centred or finds reproduction not as exciting as she initially pictured.", "NTA.\n\nI guess you should have had a fireworks display on backup just in case somebody came over to announce a pregnancy or some other special event that warranted a high level of attention.\n\nI don't know what people expect these days. It sounds like you paid plenty of attention to your sister, you just didn't have parade floats, or balloons, or whatever it was she expected.", "Nta. She had this big idea of what her announcement was going to be like and because she wasn't fawned over and had women cry-screaming she was displeased and took it out on the person she feels inadequate in comparison to. Your wife. My friends sister does the same thing to me any time she's around. Makes remarks or comments that are rude and meant to make me look bad but it only makes her look sad. You don't have to but you could maybe see about family throwing her a little shower or taking her out to eat and giving her some undivided attention. It was rude of her to do an announcement at someone's holiday party but I guess some people just don't understand etiquette. Either way, if you want to salvage the relationship, it would be kind of you to do so.", "NTA. Sorry, but I\u2019ve had multiple kids, and emotions can feel bigger while pregnant. (Then we end up doing stuff like crying over commercials and crap.) I get that this is huge news, but people are only going to talk about it for so long. You announce you\u2019re pregnant, and it\u2019s great and exciting, but people will move on to other topics. WTF was she wanting? People to be rubbing her abdomen? Repeated blow by blows of how much she\u2019s nauseous and are the little feelings she\u2019s felt in her abdomen actually the baby or just gas? What the plans are if the baby is a boy or a girl? Start planning next years Christmas dinner as a baby\u2019s first Christmas celebration? Yes, a pregnancy announcement is exciting but there\u2019s only so much to talk about that early on.", "I guess she was expecting a three hour, prime time-style sit down interview about every waking second. She wasn\u2019t ignored or brushed aside and neither OP nor her wife are TA", "She got way more attention than pregnant women in my family got.", "I think she expected the entire party to become about her once the announcement was made, then got mad when it was just one topic of conversation at the event.", "I agree, she was definitely hormonal, but never been pregnant before, she just did not realize it.", "I think I got about 5 minutes when we announced at Thanksgiving years ago...", "That is exactly what she wanted", "Especially since the gathering wasn't for that. Wasn't it (in a manner of speaking) about OP's (and Sarah's) ailing mom?", "Even at baby showers, people talk about other things!  There is only so much you can talk about with a pregnancy, especially at early stages.", "Right? This is so bizarre to me.  There\u2019s not that much to talk about.  I\u2019ve had two kids.  What are you going to talk about?  Analyze names for hours (bad idea to discuss that with family anyway)?  Talk about hemmeroids and episiotomies?  C sections?  How you may pee when you sneeze after having kids?  Go join a pregnancy group or something.  Then these crazy people will be the ones who won\u2019t be happy with the gifts they get cause they\u2019re not exactly right and no one can even meet their spawn until they\u2019re 6 months old or something.", "I guess she read \u2018Reddit and has now expectations set.\n\nNTA", "She does sounds like it", "It honestly sounds like the wife was leading a team building exercise rather than hosting a family dinner. I\u2019m so confused about OP\u2019s mentioning that the kids participated. What did they do? Was there some type of performance or presentation? Kids normally participate in family dinner by being there and eating, just like everyone else. The whole thing sounds weird.", "Yes, that's how I read this post as well...", "100%, my thoughts exactly.", "That\u2019s how I read this as well. Charlotte sounds like she likes to be in charge of every situation.", "What makes you think the other people WANTED that conversation?! It wouldn\u2019t have died out if they wanted it.

Charlotte asked literally all the questions everyone else could ask, leaving it as something that couldn't be part of a group conversation with back-and-forth. Nothing to do with \"the rest of the night\" being about it, but about being able to involve people in it.", "Wondering if Charlottes dominated the questioning so much that it kept other people quiet.", "I would not, not ever let myself being dragged into such a boring topic feeling forced to ask standardised questions.

Yeah, it may be a relief for her to finally come to this next stage of the journey, but that journey is hers alone, no one else's. She's the only one who's experiencing that relief, so she's the only one who's going to celebrate it to that fullest extent. All she's entitled to from other people is a polite response, \"Hooray, good for you!!\"", "Eh, I think it was a fine event to announce a pregnancy at. The issue is that she seems to be under the impression that means that all conversation has to be about her afterwards.", "Thank you.\n\nI was 100% with op until \"emotional\".\n\nI don't care that they've been pregnant themselves. I have too. Telling someone they're emotional never ends well. Doesn't matter if it's correct.", "I highly doubt that the conversation would have died if the others were so interested in having it. Most people don\u2019t have much interest in such a conversation and are done after the congratulation.", "I mean, it\u2019s not a secret that hormones can f*** you up pretty badly. However, they also seem to be extra pissed when you blame them.", "Also add in how the sister behaved before getting pregnant.", "Sarah is pregnant. Charlotte is OP's wife.", "Agreed. I'd be interested in hearing sister's side of this. I thought it was weird how OP mentioned her wife \"tells stories to keep everyone entertained\" ...sounds like a lot of the attention is on the host. Like, surely people enjoy themselves by interacting and talking amongst each other without planned stories to listen to. \n\nI think OP verged on being an asshole by immediately jumping to \"You're being emotional and overreacting\" \n\nSurprised to see so many nta comments", "I'm so done with men (and people in general) telling women that they are overreacting and overemotional. Honestly, it's a weapon at this point to shut people up and is inflammatory even if it is sometimes true. As for Sarah, she was being a jerk, but I feel that OP could have said so many other things to make this situation better. Saying 'hey, don't go after Charlotte like that!' would have been better. \n\nFor all the people saying that she is probably hormonal for being pregnant; I agree. But I think OP's use of 'overreacting and overemotional ' is also mental practice to ignore women (and teach them to ignore themselves) when their emotions and reactions are telling them there is something wrong.", "She has main character syndrome. She wanted the event to be a baby shower, instead of the Xmas dinner you were throwing.", "It sounded like it was specifically an early Christmas dinner gathering that OP and her wife were hosting because OP's mom wasn't able to do so, rather than specifically about the mom.  I could be wrong, though.", "Average people? Not so much interest, I\u2019d agree. But the pregnant woman\u2019s mom was there. It\u2019s not universal of course so I agree it is possible that things genuinely petered out, but it does seem odd that their mom only had 20 minutes of shared group interest in a pretty big announcement from her daughter. Especially when that 20 minutes was inclusive of individual inquiries from Charlotte about her, personally, helping and her asking about plans. Really would\u2019ve expected the mom to be the source of those questions as the closer relative. But you know, we all bring our personal experiences into things. That\u2019s why I asked OP rather than assumed.", "It's not boring if you care about the person.", "Ohh, thanks! Will fix that!", "Ummm, OP is female and mentions she\u2019s been pregnant twice, I believe\u2026.", "OP is a woman, she even mentions knowing about the hormones bc she has been pregnant twice herself", "But that's exactly what happened. If OP and sister's mom wanted to go on about it even more she could have gone and sat with sister and chatter about baby stuff the rest of the night....... but she didn't. No one was stopping anyone else from doing the same either. Charlotte is guiding the larger group conversation, but in big parties, you often have smaller groups of 2-3 ppl breaking off to chat about whatever else. \n\nI'm of the same opinion of what others have said. Sister has probably been dreaming and overhyping this day in her mind for so long that she set herself up for disappointment.", "I assume Charlotte jumped in because mom didn\u2019t. My wider family certainly wouldn\u2019t spend 20 minutes on that subject. It\u2019s too personal in my eyes and better discussed in private. You never know when you step in shit.", "That\u2019s why you do your duty and ask some polite questions about how they feel before changing subject. But pregnancy itself is not exactly interesting. We know how that works.\n\nAnd declaring that you don\u2019t care for the person because you don\u2019t want to talk about their pregnancy is really a strong and manipulative accusation", "Yes it is I love my friends and family but I'm not exactly over the moon when they're pregnant I'll hug them congratulate them say I can't wait until the kid is here that's 5 min and then we move on until the baby's born amd we get that new baby head smell", "I still think it isn't a good thing to say.", "Fine. It's still not a good thing to say to anyone and I think it's especially damaging to women. Even if it is wielded by a woman."]}
