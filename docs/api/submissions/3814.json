He\u2019s not adopted like me but his parents did move to the u.s from Korea when he was around 10. With that being said we recently had our first child and we gave her a korean name.

I explained to her many times how to say it and yet she still kept getting it wrong which felt on purpose.

I just hope that just like how being Korean is only apart of who you are, you don't try to make your child's race her entire personality.

Instead of being mad at your mom and assuming the worst, be patient and allow her time to familiarize herself with the pronunciation. Also, why would you expect your parents to teach you about Korean culture if you were raised by Americans, in America? America is your culture, Korea is your ancestor's culture and both are perfectly acceptable to raise a child.

That's like someone who did five lessons on duolingo attempting to teach someone else a language. You can't teach what you don't understand. Sure, they should have made an effort to help her learn and connect. Maybe reached out to someone who is from that culture and can answer OP's questions. But who is to say OP wouldn't have felt othered by her own parents as a child had they constantly harped on about how they are different from her adopted parents? Shouldn't the initiative come from the child? Shouldn't the child decide how they feel about their identity? After all, culture isn't in our genes, it's not connected to how we look. It's the environment we grow up in. So as far as I can see, OPs parents didn't do anything wrong until OP expressed they wanted to get more in touch with their heritage. OP is right about the name though. At least until their child is old enough to express an opinion on that.", "[Here's a video confirming your pronunciation. ](https://youtu.be/WmEjlPNLpdI)", "They're a problem for pretty much all white folks who are not Welsh or Irish XD", "Technically, I would argue that \"black names\" are also American as they developed here in America.

There is a responsibility on adoptive parents (particularly transracial adoptive parents) to be sensitive to their child\u2019s needs, and one of those needs is the knowledge of where the child comes from. The parents don\u2019t have to become overnight experts in Korean culture and language, but they should have connected the child with the child\u2019s heritage from very early on.\n\nAll adoptions begin with a trauma. Adoptive parents have a responsibility to not add to that trauma with more harm. OP was adopted as a toddler - so she was born and raised for a time in a Korean environment and then plucked from it by white people and raised to believe she was white and didn\u2019t know any different until she was almost 13 years old.

They wanted a white child and they tried to mould OP into that for them.\n\nPutting the initiative on the adopted child to ask when the adoptive parent has more agency and can block knowledge through omission is a bit like victim shaming.\n\nYou can be culturally respectful to your adoptive child without harping on about differences.

Most people then pronounce it correctly once they hear the correct pronunciation, but what really burns me up are those who continue to pronounce it incorrectly after they've heard the correct pronunciation.

I'm not trying to be mean, but this whole discussion just highlights the issue: those who are not born speaking/early adopters are not likely to be able to catch the nuance of the native born.
