He\u2019s not adopted like me but his parents did move to the u.s from Korea when he was around 10. With that being said we recently had our first child and we gave her a korean name.

I explained to her many times how to say it and yet she still kept getting it wrong which felt on purpose.

I just hope that just like how being Korean is only apart of who you are, you don't try to make your child's race her entire personality.

Instead of being mad at your mom and assuming the worst, be patient and allow her time to familiarize herself with the pronunciation. Also, why would you expect your parents to teach you about Korean culture if you were raised by Americans, in America? America is your culture, Korea is your ancestor's culture and both are perfectly acceptable to raise a child.

What's completely inexcusable though is your mom's constant insistence of YOUR name choice for your daughter is \"difficult\" and nonsense about setting her up for failure. NOPE.

If I adopted another child from a different race/culture than me I would 100% try my hardest to connect them to that.

And not hard to say, like at all. \n\nI suspect a lot of it is white savior complex stuff. They really should educate themselves on that. I'd seriously consider some massive boundaries if they continue to refuse to acknowledge your culture and refuse to learn how to say your daughters name.

They can't fix the past, but they sure as hell can be better now and in the future.", "So there is this thing some White adopters do where they're racist but see their adopted POC baby as different and try to make them integrate into whiteness as much as possible. Your daughter's name isn't difficult by any stretch of the imagination. Your parents just have racist leanings.", "Are you kidding? What\u2019s so hard about Haru?

I\u2019m not making excuses for them\u2014your parents should do better! But FWIW, they were probably taught to pretend not to see race, pretend it didn\u2019t matter. Congratulations on your daughter\u2014what a wonderful and happy (though exhausting!) time. I hope your parents move past this frustrating stage quickly.", "You are 100% correct. That protection from \"bullying\" she wants for you and your child is equivalent to \"if I teach you how to be white enough, other white people won't be racist towards you.\" Which honestly is likely more about protecting herself from her white peers making racist jokes or making fun of her for having an Asian child and grandchild.", "I agree, if the mom expected her to just forget she was Korean that's ridiculous.", "I am unsure why you feel like they tired to \"take away your culture\" from you, just because they have knowledge to connect you to your heritage. And they can't raise you to be white, anymore than you could raise a white kid to be Asian. You are hyper-focusing on the fact you have Korean heritage, that is why I made a point to say heritage isn't a persons entire identity. If you see yourself solely as a \"Korean person\" with nothing else to your identity, I am unsure of what to say to you about that. It isn't like you grew up and were raised in Korea right? You were raised in America, by Americans. Expecting them to treat you, separate from your siblings, as if you were being raised by Koreans is an odd premise. I believe the many people, perhaps the majority, who were raised in America, no matter what their skin color may be, don't have  as strong of ties to the culture of their ancestry as someone who lives in or was raised in said country. I am not trying to invalidate your feelings of wanting to connect with that part of you, even if you think I might be, but honestly while your ancestry may be Korean, you are American. That is your culture, you were raised in America by American parents. Would it have been nice to grow up knowing more about Korea? I'm sure it would've. But just because they didn't teach you about Korea, and they most certainly couldn't have been able to teach you \"how to be Korean\", doesn't mean they attempted to take something from you. It sounds like they simply gave you what they gave their other children, and maybe you don't appreciate or like that. Remember that your parents CHOSE you. They made you apart of their family, cared and raised you like their own child. Your mother might be an asshole for not trying harder to say your daughters name, I agree that she should try harder, but I think it is kind of sad to believe they attempted to white wash you, especially if you think they did it purposely with ill intent. \"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by ignorance.\"", "She doesn't state how old she is, or how old her parents are. You are assuming they had easy access to things like google when she was a child, and keep in mind google was only founded in '98. And like I stated, in her post she says she isn't the only child, she has siblings. I'd say that raising all their children equally isn't some kind of evil white washing like people are trying to make it out to be. And people aren't perfect. But based off your reply I feel like you either didn't read my full answer, or are just cherry picking a single part of it to have some kind of internet drama?", "I don't see where she was denied being Asian. Just because she was raised the same as her siblings and \"didn't realize\" she wasn't white?", "I am really concerned too. What an attitude to have when working in that profession. I hope they keep their biases to themselves while at work.", "At the risk of devolving into a debate about what constitutes culture: is it actually important to connect a child to their ethnic culture?

(Even Indigenous people afaik don\u2019t just call themselves American.) If you mean white, it\u2019d be better to specify that since people like me who are Asian and born and raised in America are constantly considered foreign and un-American just because we are not white. Not only that, white kids SHOULD challenge the idea that they are the norm and default in America. Because otherwise that\u2019s exactly how you get people like OP\u2019s family, who felt it unnecessary to raise OP with her culture because it wasn\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d to them and have left many adoptees feeling disconnected from their community and identity.", "Yeah i\u2019ve noticed that with them.

For me as an adopted child who has no connection to my birth parents whatsoever I needed to have that connection. My daughter might grow up feeling completely different from me since she will have that cultural experience her whole life. But I still do think it\u2019s very important for adoptive parents to connect their children to their culture because a lot of us have nothing. We had no way of knowing who we were on our own and I think it\u2019s great for development to know yourself and who you are.", "You're just splitting hairs...it's a name.

This is why so many white parents get ANGRY when their adopted kids try to learn about and reconnect with their culture of heritage. You\u2019re threatening the story they made for themselves because it makes them look bad and feel bad - you\u2019re the problem now, not their racist choices.\n\nIt\u2019s not about the name, _whose individual pronunciations exist in everyday English_.
