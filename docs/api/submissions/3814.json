I just hope that just like how being Korean is only apart of who you are, you don't try to make your child's race her entire personality.

Also, why would you expect your parents to teach you about Korean culture if you were raised by Americans, in America? America is your culture, Korea is your ancestor's culture and both are perfectly acceptable to raise a child.

Kids can definitely be mean and a person's name is going to be the first thing they hear, and latch onto.  Sometimes the name is seen as cool or unique but bullies will absolutely twist and turn it into an insult.", "Her name is Haru and we use the more American sounding version of her name so it\u2019s pretty straightforward imo. It might be something she\u2019ll have to correct sometimes but I do think it\u2019s stick after a few tries for most people.", "True but kids will bully you for anything. I don\u2019t think Haru is that different from your typical American style names. I want my child to be proud of her culture not afraid of it.", "\ud558\ub8e8 is an adorable name! It's also an easy one to pronounce... They are just mad you didn't name her an 'American' name.", "Just out of curiosity, what part of the name is your mom tripping over? Is it the R because it doesn't sound like an American R? \n\nIF that's the case, I wonder if suggesting to your mom that she try saying the word \"hotter\" and then replacing the \"er\" sound with an \"oo\" sound.  The word \"hotter\" is pronounced in North American English NOT with a T sound, but with a voiced tap that should resemble the Korean R.  \n\nNow, I've only learned it by watching a video explaining how to pronounce it, so if I'm way off then please forgive me.  It might just be a case of your mom getting tripped up by the way it's spelled if she's trying to impose a pronunciation based on the spelling.  \n\nAlso, it's a beautiful name and I'm sorry your mom reacted that way.  It was inappropriate and you are definitely NTA", "Omg Haru is so easy!! OP, I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m guessing there is more going on than your mom struggling to pronounce the name. Haru could even be pronounced \u201cHa-Roo\u201d if she can\u2019t roll her r\u2019s. Congrats btw!!", "They will be okay. I live in an area with very little representation of Asian people, let alone Korean. If the people here and the children in my kids\u2019 classrooms can pronounce their names and not make fun of them (eun-woo and dalnim), I am sure that this can be done and you and your husband can help encourage your children. \u201cBut people will make fun of it\u201d is no excuse when people where I live, at least, give their kids names like \u201cMickenzly\u201d or \u201cEmmyrsyn\u201d to sound and look unique. It\u2019s our culture. If you aren\u2019t a member of it, you might want to check out modern Asian moms on Facebook. It\u2019s a really great group of all sorts of Asian moms (and there are also non Asian moms who have Asian spouses and children, so it\u2019s really open minded and inclusive in that regard) and it\u2019s the most supportive Facebook mom group I\u2019ve ever been in. If you are ever looking for support and maybe experiences you can relate to, it might be a great source for you.", "Well, then she's not trying and you're NTA. I wasn't sure how close you needed the pronunciation and if maybe you were being difficult. \n\nBut she can do better than that.", "How the heck do you get from Haru to Heyra? That's definitely on purpose. Harlow I could see because some accents just add that w sound after final vowels, but going from ru to Ra and from Ha to Hey is just plain weird.", "Why are you still in contact with your family at this point?", "Because I don\u2019t really have anyone else. My siblings are not at all like my parents and my dad has gotten better over the years so it\u2019s really only my mom I have issues with now. If my mom keeps acting like this though I probably won\u2019t have any other choice then to go with low/no contact since it\u2019s effecting more than me now.", "I'm sorry OP. Sending strength you way. I hope you can now have better people with you in your husband's family \ud83d\udc95"]}
