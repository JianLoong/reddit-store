At all.\n\nEvery holiday he visits, our entire family must put up with his children. We all talk about it after they leave every year, but nothing is ever said while they are here and while its happening. I don\u2019t blame the kids either. I 100% blame the parents. The most I ever heard my brother get on to his children is just a, \"Oh hey now, come on.\" It drives me insane. His wife doesn\u2019t either.\n\nSo my brother's family came down for Christmas at my Mom's house. Immediately the littlest one (we\u2019ll call him Hayden), keeps making this guttural, whiney noise every five seconds.\n\"Ennnnh!!!\" \n\nNo matter what anybody said to him, that was his response. \u201cEnnnnh!!\u201d \n\n\u201cHey Hayden, it\u2019s nice to see you again. You\u2019re getting so big!\u201d \u201cEnnnnnh!!!\u201d\n\n\"Hayden, you want something to drink?\" \"Ennnnh!!!\"\n\nHe\u2019s constantly in \u201ccranky-just-woke-up\u201d mode 24/7. \n\nWhile this is going on, their daughter (we\u2019ll call Jayden) is picking up my mom\u2019s pets by the throat like the goddamn Undertaker and throwing them onto the furniture or just throwing them into the air. \n\nLast night, we\u2019re having dinner. Jayden is ignoring her parents, not sitting down, chasing the cat like she\u2019s on cocaine laced with Mountain Dew. She slides on her knees, crashes right into Mom\u2019s table top. She knocks the table over, a vase falls over and breaks. She looks around the room and starts fake-crying. She runs to her daddy and of course he pops his titty in her mouth, figuratively speaking.\n\nAgain, while that is happening we\u2019re all trying to talk and Hayden is ENNNNH!!!ing at the table, \n\nAdmittedly, I snapped.\n\n\u201cHEY!... SHUT UP! Nobody wants to hear that shit! How are you not getting on your own nerves? Shut up!\u201d\u201d\n\n\u201cJayden, if you pick that cat up one more time, I\u2019m going to pick you up and throw you the same way you do the cat! SIT DOWN!\"\n\nAwkward silence around the table. Nothing but the sound of forks hitting plates.\n\nAfter dinner, I go outside to smoke, I come back to the door, and I can hear my brother\u2019s wife saying \u201cIf he\u2019s going to talk to our children like that, then we just won\u2019t come back. I can't believe you let him talk to them like that.\u201d She\u2019s talking to my brother.\n\nI walked inside and just went off. I don\u2019t remember exactly what I said but I basically covered everything.\n\n\u201cI talk to your children like that because both of you don\u2019t! Nobody likes it when y'all come over because you don\u2019t discipline your kids! They abuse animals! They break shit! They just whine and scream constantly and you do nothing! And we all talk about it when you\u2019re not here!\u201d\n\nSo naturally, his wife called me a \u201cdickhead.\u201d She walked out of the room. My brother mean-mugged me. I go visit the rest of the family in the game room. Next thing I know they\u2019re walking out the door with their bags to go back to Texas.

Sometimes it comes down to the blunt approach. I will say, tho, that rather than the rest of the family talking how bad it is after they leave, seemingly implying no one addressed it, someone at some point should\u2019ve had a serious convo with your brother.

I only had 3,000 characters to explain but there\u2019s a lot more that happened and a lot more that has happened over the years. \n\nLast year, for example, during Thanksgiving, my sister was asleep on the couch after eating, and \u201cJayden\u201d picked the cat up and dropped it on my sisters face while she was asleep. The cat freaked out and scratched up my sisters my face running away. Even swelled up one of her eyes. \n\nMy sister, her husband, my parents, the kids parents, nobody did anything!! I couldn\u2019t believe it. Not even an empty discipline threat was made. It\u2019s like my family just lets this chaos happen because \u201cit\u2019s the holidays\u201d and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right. \n\nBUT, I probably could\u2019ve approached it differently long before it got to this level.

A shock to the system might be exactly what they need.", "based on this, you probably did the right thing before the kids escalated", "Without boundaries kids escalate and your brother and SIL aren't teaching them boundaries. The cat on your sister's face incident was an escalation and that poor cat suffers abuse from your niece who treats it like a toy. Someone got hurt, as in emergency room (which I hope she went to) hurt, and it was swept under the rug.", "You speak to them like people.  \n\nYou would never yell \"shut-up\" at a colleague who's acting like an idiot at work. You work up to that point.  \n\nKids are just little idiots. You need to negotiate with them - just like a hostage taker. Only your the negotiator and the hostage.", "A colleague at work should have the emotional maturity to not need to be told \"shut up\".\n\nThese are kids who haven't heard No, the daughter got away with scratching up her aunt's face by putting the cat on it and everyone else ignored or excused it *including her aunt's husband*. Trying to negotiate isn't starting at square one, it's starting at square zero. There's a difference between idiot and animal abuser", "Yell at the parents for that. They need to learn how to parent, but the kids don't know any better. \n\nI get what you're saying, but they're children. It just doesn't work yelling at them like that. \n\nIt gets out your own frustration but doesn't move the ball forward. \n\nI've got 3 boys, and it can be enormously challenging, but the most successful discipline is when they're participants in the consequence. They need to understand. Yelling at them just shuts them down and they continue the behaviour.", "The parents have checked out of, well, parenting. OP's brother acted more his kid's ages than his own when called out on his bad parenting. I'm going to credit you with that you do strive to teach your kids boundaries and how to behave. This set of parents see discipline as being a killjoy, so a massive wake-up call needs to happen for them to realise they need to actually parent before they've burned their bridges and have no negotiating position with their own children.\n\nNow someone has finally said it, hopefully it empowers others to speak up where they need to."]}
