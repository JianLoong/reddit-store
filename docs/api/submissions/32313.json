Ursula in The Little Mermaid as an example. I've seen black, white, skinny and fat actresses all play the role and no physical characterisrics takes away or adds to the character at all. They all were totally great and believable. \n\nOther characters absolutely do matter. Captain Phoebus in Hunchback of Notre Dame is supposed to be a White European man who's a respected warrior and good with the ladies, AND be a direct contrast to the much more homely quasimodo and old Frollo. So a relatively tall, decent shape, good looking guy with natural charisma is absolutely required. We need to believe that Esmeralda would fall for the guy over the other 2. It would be horribly distracting and unbelievable otherwise. \n\nNow I certainly understand that beauty and attractiveness can be different from person to person, but we typically have to play to the vast majority with certain roles. \n\nSo no. You are not shallow. As an actor, we have to accept the fact that in some cases, we either need to accept the fact that we are built for certain roles, and not others. OR Work on ourselves to better match the roles we'd like to play. \n\nSome will argue (correctly) that an actor's skill should outweigh their physical characteristics. I often agree here. HOWEVER - Those skills must come through during auditions. PERIOD. We cannot just hope that the actor will be able to pull it out during the process of rehearsal. That's a formula that has doomed many a show. Auditions are not a place for giving every underdog an opportunity. Auditions are about picking the best person for the role. \n\nNTA", "Eh, I\u2019m torn honesty.\n\nOn one hand, you don\u2019t really know whose going to end up being the better actor until they\u2019ve both had the chance to rehearse and I feel like you should\u2019ve done a more thorough audition before deciding.
