Ursula in The Little Mermaid as an example. I've seen black, white, skinny and fat actresses all play the role and no physical characterisrics takes away or adds to the character at all. They all were totally great and believable. \n\nOther characters absolutely do matter. Captain Phoebus in Hunchback of Notre Dame is supposed to be a White European man who's a respected warrior and good with the ladies, AND be a direct contrast to the much more homely quasimodo and old Frollo. So a relatively tall, decent shape, good looking guy with natural charisma is absolutely required. We need to believe that Esmeralda would fall for the guy over the other 2. It would be horribly distracting and unbelievable otherwise. \n\nNow I certainly understand that beauty and attractiveness can be different from person to person, but we typically have to play to the vast majority with certain roles. \n\nSo no. You are not shallow. As an actor, we have to accept the fact that in some cases, we either need to accept the fact that we are built for certain roles, and not others. OR Work on ourselves to better match the roles we'd like to play. \n\nSome will argue (correctly) that an actor's skill should outweigh their physical characteristics. I often agree here. HOWEVER - Those skills must come through during auditions. PERIOD. We cannot just hope that the actor will be able to pull it out during the process of rehearsal. That's a formula that has doomed many a show. Auditions are not a place for giving every underdog an opportunity. Auditions are about picking the best person for the role. \n\nNTA", "Eh, I\u2019m torn honesty.\n\nOn one hand, you don\u2019t really know whose going to end up being the better actor until they\u2019ve both had the chance to rehearse and I feel like you should\u2019ve done a more thorough audition before deciding.

It's just the way it is. When I was much younger I auditioned for the part of Rolf in \"The Sound of Music\". I nailed the singing. I had stayed up all night learning the required audition song. The music director knew me from previous plays and a musical and was confident in my acting ability as they had asked me to audition because, at 6'1\" tall and 197 lbs with no fat, they thought that I was a good physical fit for the role. Long story short, I didn't get the role because I had brown hair. The director chose an actor who fit his image of the role. He selected a 5'9\" average body actor who had botched the audition song and had blonde hair. Sure I was disappointed, but I also understood his choice. I did offer to bleach my hair and eyebrows, but the director was firm with his decision. In the end, the musical wasn't well received due to a number of lackluster performances.

Ruined one of my favorite books.", "You can\u2019t simplify a character with \u201cvisual cues\u201d if those don\u2019t match the real person the character is based on. That literally makes zero sense, you seem to be only one that cares about the appearance of the character in terms of attractiveness.\n\nFor cleopatra did you make sure to cast a girl with a big nose that\u2019s plus size? Because that\u2019s what she looked like, or do you only care about \u2018visual cues\u2019 for characters when it allows you to cast more conventionally attractive people?", "Shawshank Repemption is a classic King adaptation.\n\nAnd Morgan Freeman playing Red, written as an Irish-American in the story, was breathtaking.", "The Running Man. \n\nStill holds up, even with the changes (the arena not just out in the world, the other runners actually dying, the use of AI to change the narrative, Ben Richards not being a miner but a cop; although this is alluded to with the disguise he wears to get out the resistance camp)", "Ah, Shawshank Redemption is also good. \n\nWe're still looking at a half dozen or so good adaptations out of many terrible ones.", "Nah I would say they're actually very aware of acting and roles and stage. That _is_ just how casting works. You cast the person who's best for the role. If the guy who didn't fit the role was \"not amazing enough\" to pull it off then yeah, find someone who can pull it off."]}
