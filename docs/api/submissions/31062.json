Not your gf, not your bf, not your mom, not your wife, not your husband, not your best friend, not your cat. \"Oh, but she saw it by accident because we've been like one for so long\" BS. You're not supposed to show it, she's not supposed to try to guess it. Use biometrics (e.g.fingerprints whenever possible) and set your phone to autolock quickly. \nTwo. Taking naked selfish is stupid. No, it's not about how you send/share/hide/lock them. They will go out eventually. Also, what for?... you're in along distance relationship that you need to send reminders of each other? Pfff. You're banging everyday ffs. Ah, but I'm just looking at those pics permanently?

I wouldn't post anything in this manner about myself or my other half but that's just me.

We are both currently attending college together and are in the same program and class. We were sitting on the couch when she suddenly asked if I looked at anything at school today. I told her I wasn\u2019t sure what she meant\u2014did I look at what\u2014and then asked her to clarify. My partner begins to laugh and asks, \"Did you look at anything?\" It turns out she had gone through my phone when I left it on the counter and saw that I had saved a picture on my phone while on the John at school for a porn folder. I know it sounds weird, but I find that due to life stresses, it\u2019s hard to naturally want to have sex as frequently as my partner (i.e., every day), and to help get me in the mood, I\u2019ll flip through this folder.\n\nMy partner and I have never discussed the folder or why I have it. She wasn\u2019t upset about the folder, and I wasn\u2019t upset she saw the photos. We laughed about it together, and I stated, \"Since you looked through my phone, then I get to look through yours.\" My partner happily handed hers over, not expecting me to find anything. I was not prepared for what I found there. I should start with the preference: I don\u2019t send nudes. I have heard too many revenge nude stories, and as a result, I won\u2019t send them. I almost broke up with this same girl when we started dating because I found out she was secretly screen recording a Snapchat I sent during our early dating phase.\n\nI found a hidden folder in her camera that was all naked pictures of me that were stolen off my phone without my knowledge or consent. We have had many talks in the past about how I feel about nudes being sent, and they made the decision not only to invade my privacy by going through my phone multiple times over months but also to steal my photos and send them to herself.\n\nAITA? What should I do?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s never ok for your partner to treat you this way. What\u2019s stopping her from sharing these photos of you with others?

Move on and let her be someone else\u2019s burden.", "If she Bluetoothed them it may not keep a record.", "She took the nudes to use against you in the event of a breakup. Only reasonable explanation. I hope you deleted them", "NTA. She's violated your privacy to accuse you of something that's none of her business. All while feeling justified in doing something pretty creepy.\n\nI would dump this person. \n\nIn my experience, no amount of reasoning or reassurance will make them desist from being paranoid and invading your privacy while feeling okay with doing far worse than they accuse you of. \n\nSome people might change in time. But you aren't a charity, and it's not your obligation to fix someone's anti-social issues. \n\nBite the bullet. Take the heartbreak on the chin. And find a nice person. It's daunting but a lot less work than trying to rehabilitate an asshole.", "NTAH\nYour partner on the other hand\u2026 Talk about a huge red flag. Not only did she violate your trust, and privacy, she stole from you. (Curious why you even had nudes of yourself, considering your no sharing policy). Your partner has zero respect for you. She has shown that she is willing to sneak around to do what she wants regardless of your boundaries. When confronted with her behavior she gave you a BS answer. She knew it was wrong, she didn\u2019t care. She is only sorry that she got caught.", "I have been in your partners shoes before. \nI recorded my partner and took photos while we Skyped in the past in intimate ways, I didn\u2019t ask permission in the beginning and when she found them she was angry. \n\nalways ask permission. \n\nMy partner is a female and hates her photo taken. \n\nI had a long argument with her about this two years ago, maybe longer, and realized I was the asshole after a long time of rethinking about my decisions. \n\n\nYour partner needs to do the same thing I had to do and realize it\u2019s not okay. \n\nNTA. \nGood luck OP. \n\nTook me two years to figure it out with my current partner, and we both now have a good system about intimate photos.", "NTA. Boy, run! Run far far away!", "NTA. This is a violation of trust of the highest order. AFTER you gave her a second chance for the same behaviour. Next time you see her, make her delete those photos. Make her very aware that as you did not consent to her possessing them, she is breaking the law and you WILL press charges if she does not delete them/they ever show up anywhere again. And once she has deleted your stolen nudes in front of you, dump her.", "Omg, consent. You had a clear boundary and she broke it. Plus going through a partner's phone is abuse.

It\u2019s not like I leave them lying around either, I delete them right away or lock them in my snap vault but somehow she got them. I am not only embarrassed that she has seen private photos of me  but that she could have copies that I wasn\u2019t able to delete. I did wipe the ones off her hidden folder, but I don\u2019t even know how the photos were transferred off my phone. Was it email, text, air drop.

A guy buddy of mine but he didn\u2019t think it was that big a deal and just thought we should talk it out. I\u2019m a private guy and the idea that she has gone through my phone multiple time over the last couple of months and stole a few different times just completely throws me. She knew my passcode from seeing me put it in, we have been together 2.5 years.

Those can be really harmful in a relationship.", "your friend is wrong. this is a big deal and a perfectly legitimate reason to end the relationship. the fact that she observed and misused your passcode is bad enough.\n\nI hope you make it through this. Goddamn this is fucked up", "There\u2019s the whole issue of her having your photos. But yet you have photos of other naked girls on your phone. What do you do? imagine yourself having sex with the girls in your porn folder instead of your girlfriend while you\u2019re having sex? Seems like your sex life is out the door with her, and trust now too, might as well go the whole way out the door and move on to someone you\u2019re genuinely attracted to and can trust.", "If you can't trust her with your phone what else can't she be trusted with?", "Hello \ud83d\udc4b", "Well no, he said he had a folder of porn that he likes to flip through. I didn't read that to mean that he had a folder of porn of himself. That would be... unexpected.", "Those are two different issues. While some people might not agree with their partners looking at porn, this is an issue about consent. Unless he has reason to think that the people in those pictures didn't give consent to have their bodies used for porn, it's a separate thing, and it seems his gf doesn't have that particular issue.\n\nThe pictures she has of him, though, she KNOWS she doesn't have his consent to have. She is the one who took them without consent.\n\nAlthough one of the issues that I have with porn is that you aren't usually able to personally verify that they were recorded and distributed with full, informed consent of the actors, I still think there is a difference between KNOWING you stole and saved pics without consent, and acting in good faith that the porn distributor had consent from the porn actors. It might be a bit naive to assume so, but it's still different from knowingly stealing and saving pics against the consent of the person in those images.", "I understand the main point completely. And since so many comments are rightfully addressing it, I was shining light to a thought that popped to my head about the sex life with his partner. If he needs to look at other girls to be aroused, he should date other girls instead"]}
