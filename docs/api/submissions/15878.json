I told my 24 year old brother that he is an entitled brat. He grew up although the oldest being treated like the baby. He was the pride of the family because he was very book smart(notice I say book\nSmart bc he has no common sense at all). He can\u2019t cook, he can\u2019t clean, he doesn\u2019t know how to close the toilet seat, shut the door, turn off the lights when he leaves the room, or start a washing machine. He t-boned and totaled the car we shared as teens bc he was playing on his phone (he got in not an ounce of trouble for it btw) My mother always followed him around doing the basics and if she wasn\u2019t doing it I was expected to do it or I would get in trouble. If you\u2019re thinking, you sound jealous I definitely was! Lol. The current issue arose when he came home from spring break. I\u2019m 2 years younger than him. For some god awful reason he thought I would do his cooking, cleaning, and laundry while he was back home then proceeded to throw a fit when I said no and tried to tell me I was being a \u201cb!tch\u201d. So i responded that he was being an entitled brat. Not that it\u2019s shocking but I got yelled at by mother dearest for it.

Your mom is an enabler and is as much TA as he is.  It's NOT your job to take care of him and I shudder to think how he would treat any partner in the future if he doesn't learn to stop acting like a toddler and do the most basic things an adult needs to know how to do. It's pathetic and you should not put up with it.", "He\u2019s 24 yrs old, he should know how to do basic chores. Tell your golden child brother that you\u2019re not his maid.

His future girlfriends and your sanity will thank you for it", "NTA and mommy has molly coddled brother right into HELPLESS for the rest of his natural life.", "NTA. The fact that you felt the need to come to Reddit for an answer has me concerned about how you were treated growing up while your brother was being spoiled. Wish you the best.", "NTA.

Don't tolerate this bullshit.", "I agree \ud83e\udd1d", "Very interesting thank you \ud83e\udd14", "Thank you and I agree with everything you said. I fear for his future partners. He has had no successful relationships so far and it\u2019s blatantly obvious as to why.", "I was treated like a slave unfortunately that was all I knew. I am much better off in life now (:", "Same \ud83d\ude00", "I\u2019ve decided to absolutely not tolerate it and I\u2019m dealing with so much crap for it. Im absolutely not backing down now im so sick of this!", "What does he do when he\u2019s is college? Presumably you or your mom aren\u2019t waiting in a dark corner his room ready to cater to his every whim? How does he cope then?", "Eh, from the sound of it you don't need to worry about his future partners, there aren't likely to be any worth worrying about!", "They offer a buffet at his college for all meals and I have no idea what he does for laundry but I know he can\u2019t use the washing machine at home. I assume he can\u2019t make a mess in the room bc of his roommate. He\u2019s never had a messy room though he just makes messes everywhere else.", "He once dated an old friend of mine and it ended horribly.

This sounds a lot like weaponised incompetence, claiming to not be able to do something/do it properly so others will just do it for him.\n\nI find it hard to believe a college student can\u2019t learn how to use a washing machine. Your mother has totally screwed him over, god help his further gf/wife.", "The older he gets, the more people will (justifiably) expect of him, and that will probably mean they'll be disappointed enough to leave quite quickly. What flies at 15 isn't going to fly at 25. Of course, a lot of guys like that end up fishing for much younger partners who don't know they should expect better, but here's hoping that's yet another thing he's incapable of doing successfully!", "Oh it absolutely is weaponized incompetence. This man has photographic memory. Hes been a straight A student his entire life lol he chooses to act like an incompetent child unfortunately.", "Well, the rest of the world won\u2019t put up with that crap, so he may as well learn that now, or all he\u2019ll be left with is his mommy.", "Our mother is a 65 year old former drug addict and current alcoholic he better buckle his pants soon \ud83d\ude2c", "Good lord, if he really thinks she is the person who he should be listening to, he\u2019s clearly only book smart. Poor boy has no idea that mommy dearest will soon be looking to him to support her with a \u201clook at everything I\u2019ve done for you over the years\u201d. Maybe I\u2019m cynical, but if he\u2019s always been a smart as you say, your mom is looking at him as her meal ticket once he graduates and presumably gets a high paying job. Either way, He\u2019s in for a world of pain.", "I agree with everything you said. She is like the human form of manipulation and gaslighting. I tried to tell him when we were kids that she was not a good mother or person but of course she loved him like a baby and he was obsessed with her. I mean he slept in her bed till he was 14. Their relationship is build off of emotion abuse. She will get old and use him and he will let it happen. I have given up on trying to make him understand this."]}
