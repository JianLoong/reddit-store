Yesterday i saw a tiktok about a document. It was about a girl who escape from her abuser parents house. I watched the document and told my mother about it. She was shocked and felt really sorry for the kids inside that home. Then started to say things like \"see i would never abuse you or hurt you you should be thankfull for that\" i was thankfull for not having an abuser mom but i didnt think that i had to thank her for that. Later that day she proceeded to talk about abusive people. But before going to the bed she told me that she was upset because i should have thanked her for not being an abuser. I told her that she was being crazy and psycho for saying that. She got really sad and quiet and left my room. I felt terrible but i slept eventually. When i woke up i saw her eating breakfast and i asked where is mine. She told me that i deserve a bad mother beacuse apparently i act like she is the problem. When she finished her breakfast she left the house. Now im home alone and she wont answer my calls.

I was standing in the door and she huged me. I apologized for calling her a psycho and she apologized for forcing me to thank her. Then she went to take a shower. I heard her crying. I dont know if she had abusive parent because she really loves her father and mother. I gave her a cup of tea when she got out and we talked a bit but not about her parents or the abusive things. I thinks she is ok now but idk", "NTA. \"Thanks, mom, for not being an axe-murderer.\" \"Thanks, mom, for not turning our house into a meth lab.\" \"Thanks, mom, for not leaving me abandoned as an infant in an alley.\" Wow she's really clearing a low bar here.\n\nNot great to call her a psycho but not gonna call you an a h for it.", "NTA. My mother often told me I should be grateful that I was the only one she kept! She was 80 the last time she said this. \n\nAbusers do not mellow with age. They just use more verbal poison and less physical action. \n\nMove on emotionally, mentally and physically, when you can. Learn how not be her and prosper \ud83e\udd17", "NTA. She will get over her sadness or whatever her issue is (past trauma herself?). You can honestly tell her you appreciate her and ask if there is anything she wants to talk about. \n\nAt 17 you can also make your own breakfast.", "INFO: was your mom abused as a child? Maybe she wanted some recognition for breaking the cycle but didn\u2019t know how to express it. She definitely seems affected by the topic.", "NTA even if she was abused herself as a child and worked hard to be a better parent for you, it doesn't mean she is supposed to expect an award or special recognition for simply not being garbage. She wanted you to thank her for not being abusive and then proceeded to act manipulative and immaturely when you didn't. That's abuse, maybe not on the same level as the documentary, but imagine if I drove up to the police station and asked them to thank me for not being a criminal. No? Okay, so now I am going to rob a McDonald's. Like??? What is wrong with adults these days?", "NTA - your mother is acting very childishly. A mother is expected to give loving, compassionate care. There is no reason to thank her for not being abusive, that\u2019s really weird and seems like a power move", "NTA and your Mom\u2019s reaction sounds slightly OTT but it could likely be that there is more going on with her that you\u2019re not aware of/she hasn\u2019t shared with you - possibly related to childhood abuse of her own. Could be completely wrong with that theory but from how you\u2019ve described the situation it seems she was triggered after discussing the documentary. Glad to see in your update that you guys have now talked it through and made amends though!", "NTA\n\nThere's more than physical and sexual abuse. \n\nAbuse comes in different forms and also severities. Most people are abusive at one point in their lives. I want to make that clear. \n\nWhat your mom does is actually emotional abuse. And it's totally not OK. \n\nI don't know if your mom is generally emotionally abusive or if this is a one time incident. You could ask her why this is so important to her and try clarify that. But again that would go in the direction you take care of her emotions. Which is parentification and/or emotional incest which again is emotional abuse. \n\nMaybe your mom just had a bad day. Parents are humans. They make mistakes and have their moods. Just like any other human. But your mom should really not behave like that. I'm a mom myself and what your mom does in this situation is weird at best. \n\nYou're clearly not an AH.", "Her behaviour sounds emotionally abusive to be honest.\n\nCan you persuade her to get therapy?", "NTA - also your mother's actions basically amount to emotional abuse, so what is there to 'thank' her for now?", "Had see been a good mom?  Thank her for being a good mom.  Thank her for some of the things she has done for you. \n\nI am sure she feels under appreciated.  Give her some love and a hug", "Based on your update, it sounds pretty likely your mother experienced some abuse in the past that made her behave that way. \n\nI say either NAH or ESH. Can't decide, but there is not  one clear wrong person.", "ESH, her request was unreasonable, but your reply was also OTT. She might need a little reassurance she was a good mom (if true?) But went about it in an asinine way.", "ESH\n\n\"Yes mum i am lucky, thx for being loving mother to me\" end of story.\n\nSometimes people need little validation like this. If it is not against your core beliefs, just indulge in it. \n\nYou shouldn't had called her psycho.\n\nShe shouldn't had taken to the moon the thankful thingy.", "YTA for calling her a psycho when she's just trying to talk to you", "Sounds like mom is insecure and fishing for compliments. How hard is it to say thank you?", "INFO:\n\nYou brought up horrific child abuse as a topic and your mother became upset out of empathy for the victims, and sought reassurance for her own parenting, and this was somehow a surprise?\n\nYou really don't feel you need to express gratitude to your mother?\n\nYou actually told her that you believed she was \"crazy and psycho\"?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She is blackmailing you to get what she wants.  How is that not being a bad abusive parent?  A good parent does not stop feeding her minor child to get her child to thank her for not being an abusive parent.  That is abuse!", "NTA\n\nWe don\u2019t expect this from adults \u201cthanks husband for not beating me.\u201d \u201cThanks wife for not filing a false report.\u201d \u201cThanks coworker for not shooting up the office.\u201d Nah, that\u2019s not the standard. \n\nThis whole story makes me think this woman is abusive. Normal people don\u2019t say this stuff. Abusers have to find some crazy outlier story to compare themselves to. My dad always told me and my sister how lucky we were that we don\u2019t get FGM and raped in the Middle East. (There was never real danger of that. We were all born in the US and our family had been here for over one hundred years. So it\u2019s not like a reference to an escape or anything like that.) Because that\u2019s how low he had to go to look good. (He MGM all my brothers.)", "Do things like this happen often?", "Yup\n\n\"So...you want me to praise you for doing the bare minimum of what is legally required of you as a parent?\"\n\nAnd I hope she did provide food because she IS required to take basic care of OP as a minor. Pretty sure withholding food is neglect.", "I agree. Children should not have to be thankful for the bare minimum. Their parents not being abusers is kind of a bare minimum for parents\u2026 and a very low standard. \n\nNTA.", "Its our tradition to make a great sunday breakfast and she always prepares it i know how to make breakfast to my self. I am going to talk with her about this also", "I absolutely think you are not the asshole here! It sounds like your mother has gone too far in her demands, which is not fair, and she should respect your opinion and right to decline. It's not right for you to be criticised for making a decision about your own life.", "I was thinking the same thing. There has to be more to it.", "No but her parents werent that affectionate i think", "That\u2019s not something you look for from your kids while they\u2019re still kids. Brag on the internet if you have to. Your kids are still entitled to not be abused.", "I guess, but it's not really your child's responsibility to thank you for not being a shitty parent, which is kind of the point here. Nothing wrong with a child wanting to express gratitude to a parent, but it should come naturally and from the heart, not because Mom thinks they should be grateful by default. They didn't ask to be born, and honestly, the way your child turns out IS the thanks you get for raising them. If Mom is feeling underappreciated and overworked, it's because Dad isn't pulling his weight, not because the child isn't thanking them enough.", "I am giving her love but this made me feel a bit weird thats all", "She wasnt just trying to talk to me please read carefully", "Nope this is the first time", "Ask her", "Your still the asshole bud", "I like your update. I feel like that was a good bonding moment for you two and you learned somethings about each other. Thank you for sharing that. \n\nMy vote is NAH, just sounds like the topic struck a chord with both of you and weren\u2019t sure how to communicate about it. Made you both sad. Maybe some retail therapy is in order lol", "Oh ok", "My father is died when i was a little child so my mother is the most important person in my life. I dont want to lose her for something stupid. But i think break the ice a bit by talking to her", "I think it\u2019ll be ok \ud83d\ude42", "So she's been a single parent? I have no doubt she loves you but raising a child on your own is tough. Her reaction is a bit weird but she probably wants some reassurance she did well on her own. Maybe you could surprise her with something small. I almost always bake something for my mom when I visit her because she was alone raising us and I appreciate it couldn't be easy for her (her favorite is apple pie). If I don't have the time, I buy her a gift. Really it's all about just making her smile and feel loved.", "I hope so thank you \ud83d\ude0a", "We had no issue before and we barely fight. I am trying to be supportive and since im not an extrovert i usually stay at home hanging out with her. She is my best friend. And she knows that i love her", "Everone gets insecure sometimes. You don't have to thank her for not abusing you (that is a weird request, ngl) but a little bit of morale boost goes a long way.", "Yeah ok"]}
