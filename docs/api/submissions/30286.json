Why do you think she's safer without a lock?\n\nHave you looked at the possible types of locks available which could alleviate the concerns?

Locks on doors is about privacy. And everyone deserves privacy. They may want privacy from each other. Maybe the 2yo is going through stuff. You\u2019ve already got rules. Putting locks on the door is just another situation that requires rules. Work with them and give your boundaries for allowing locks and listen to their boundaries. Do a trial run. If it doesn\u2019t work out, it doesn\u2019t work out. You can remove a lock just as easily as you can install one. \n\nI\u2019m going with YTA for this reason. Have the sit down talk.

You don't have to particularly trust her online activities, but that is not a parallel issue to her physical privacy in the home. Bedrooms, ALL bedrooms, should have locks.

Underlining result is you are the parents and you have to trust yourselves and your intentions, but also accept whatever happens because of it.\n\nFirst off. The fact that she has 3 step brothers. You never said how long it's been for you guys living together. But being the only girl, and your wife not being her mother, she could feel like anything she says about the boys could be seen negatively and she doesn't wish to do that. But she may also not feel that safe.\n\nIt would be hard for you to imagine, as you are not a woman, but having 3 guys which aren't blood related living in your house and bringing other guys over to thw house could be pretty scary for a 15 year old. At least maybe awkward and uncomfortable.\n\nShe also may want to explore herself sexually, which would be perfectly natural and fine, but she may not feel completely safe in her room, and may end up exploring sex with boys instead of just herself, because you won't put a lock on her door. Just a possibility, which makes these decisions harder to evaluate. You could easily make a 'no locks when your friends are over' rule, so if you don't have friends over you can lock, so you don't get interrupted by someone elses friends.\n\nMy main concern is that she isn't blood related to any of them, and you haven't said how long they've been step siblings for. We don't know how she views her step siblings or their private interractions. A part of me feels she wants a lock because she doesn't feel safe.\n\nBut ultimately, you do what you feel is right.

I'm also a former educator and have been the sounding board for a LOT of teen shit. \n\nLook, it's not nice. But you have to give her space and freedom. Talk to her about safety (including protected sex!!), and it's probably too late for you or your wife to be her confidante but make sure she has a responsible adult she can trust who she can be honest and open with. Give her a strict curfew and normal things like grade targets, ensure she's not in the path of violence or things that will affect her for life (underage tattoos, arrest, pregnancy etc) and give her enough rope to make her mistakes safely and have a home to return to. If you monitor her socials, let her have a blog she can write anonymously or something, with the caveat that she can't have photos or any identifying info on there. Let her go to gigs alone but pick her up. Let her have an appropriate job and make tentative steps to adulthood that way. Let her redecorate to match her current personality.

They're all counting the days until they can move out.", "You ask why? Do you want to hear that your daughter is changing her tampon? It doesn't matter why.\n\nAnd just knowing that someone can come into your room or go through your things at anytime is stressful. I lived in this kind of household and I now have 0 contact with my family. My own teens have pretty much unfettered access to the internet and complete privacy in their rooms. And you know what, because we built good relationships and talked about online safety and respect, etc, from day 1,  they tell me stuff. They even tell me how teenagers can avoid exactly the kind of invasions you're talking about. Unless you're an IT expert, it's really easy for kids to get around your rules.  You don't trust them.
