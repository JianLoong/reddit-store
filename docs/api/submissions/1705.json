My wife has struggled with Ed and depression.\n\nA few months ago, this started back up again after some *other* issues occurred, Now usually she eats good when this issue doesn\u2019t occur.

Those telling you its ok to wear white to the reception are gaslighting you and enabling her. Your mother knew what she was doing and she would have ruined your wifes night for sure.

Your wife really wants your mother to like her, but it's an unhealthy desire as she just keeps pressuring you to include your mom in situations where your mother chooses to be shitty. You know her better than your wife, and probably know how she is/has always been.\n\nI think it's time to dig your heels in and remind your wife each time that your mother is who she is and won't rise to any occasion she's given.
