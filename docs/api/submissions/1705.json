Otherwise carry on with low or no contact.", "They are probably afraid of rocking the boat and don\u2019t want to deal with her so they are being ridiculous to OP.

She is competing with OP\u2019s wife after all.", "This is fair.", "Oh god.", "NTA, it sounds like your mother has an emotionally incestuous relationship with you, and you did nothing wrong by getting her out of there because her presence was just there to try and exercise control over your life, and disrespect your spouse.", "NTA", "I admire your wife\u2019s kindness, but I do think the two of you need to have a big talk about your mother and her involvement in your lives and how keeping her involved will only end in pain and tears. \n\nYou two got through the marriage part (congrats btw), but the next big milestone could be children, and your mothers behaviour *will* get worse once you have a child of your own. It\u2019s happened many ties before, and with how your mother acted towards your wife throughout your relationship and through your wedding - she honestly shouldn\u2019t be trusted around your children. \n\nParents like your mother, who allow their hatred and self-righteousness blind them of what truly matters.
