She wanted me to remove the bidet.\n\nI don't see why I should, since it's basically a regular toilet with the bidet settings off. She says that the seat is now too high and that it feels weird to lean back on it, but I don't really see the difference. I really like this bidet and it's been a real gamechanger for me.\n\nSo now, she's insisting that I move the bidet and all my stuff to the guest bathroom and use that instead, but I don't want to do that either since wouldn't it just make more sense for her to use the toilet in that room? Plus its a real hassle to uninstall and reinstall the bidet. But she says that it's my bidet, so it's my problem. We live in a one story home and our bathrooms are literally around the hall from one another. The only difference is that the bidet bathroom is really close to the bedroom.

I went back and forth in my verdict a few times. You're the AH - no, your wife is - no, you are - no, your wife is...\n\nSome comments:\n\n* You like what you like. You get used to what you get used to. I'm shorter than average, and I like a toilet that's just the right height for me. Not too low, because I am disabled and would have trouble getting up from it. Not too high, because I'd feel like I'm perched on a bar stool. If someone went in to my bathroom and adjusted the height of my toilet (in either direction) and I had to use it like that forever - yes, I'd be annoyed, and yes, I'd probably remind them about it a lot.\n* I have never actually seen one of those bidet seat things that sits over the toilet, but I'll take your word for it that it was a big deal to install it and it would be a colossal pain to uninstall. However, if you *can* uninstall it and reinstall it in the guest bathroom, you should. For every decision that affects you both, you should work on the two-yeses-one-no principle. (e.g. Should we get a dog? Two yeses = we should get a dog. One yes one no means no we shouldn't.) You wanted this bidet. You *convinced* your wife (your words) to get the bidet. It doesn't sound like she was keen, but you twisted her arm. Now she has tried it, she is even less keen, but your attitude seems to be: too bad, you're stuck with it.\n* You should both take a step backwards from this dispute and remind yourselves that you are immensely privileged to live in a two-bathroom home, where the two bathrooms are very close to each other. Never in my life have I lived in a house with more than one bathroom, and sometimes that house had as many as ten people crammed into it. I have also lived more than half my life in houses with no indoor toilet. That's a whole lot of fun when it's the middle of the night in winter and you need to pee.\n\nMy verdict: YTA. The person who deserves to walk a few extra steps to the bathroom with the bidet is you.\n\nIf it simply is not feasible to uninstall it and reinstall it in the guest bathroom, then your wife will need to be the one to walk the few extra steps.\n\nEither way, it's only a few steps. It's not going halfway down the yard in the middle of the night.", "YTA\n\nIf you want to modify a toilet to your liking, making it uncomfortable for her to use, then *you* should modify the guest bathroom.  Not the main bathroom that she uses.  \n\nWould you like it if the toilet you use was suddenly much shorter, putting your knees up in your chest and making you distinctly uncomfortable every time you use it?  She deserves to be comfortable in her own home and in her own bathroom.  If you want to introduce a change, and that change causes her extreme discomfort, the least you can do is implement that change in the secondary bathroom.", "YTA. It may be a TMI question, but how often do you poop? Not interested in your bowel health but the fact that women have to sit down to pee and poop. You just sit down to poop (I assume). So you expect her to be uncomfortable 100% if the time so you can use the bidet 20% of the time? Just move it.", "This isn't anout bidet.\n\n>that the seat is now too high and that it feels weird to lean back on it\n\nYour wife tells you the new toilet is too high for her to use comfortable. And you are not willing to change it back to the hight she can use safely.\n\n**INFO**:\n\n>I really like this bidet and it's been a real gamechanger for me\n\nBecause of the new higher hight or because of the water?", "Soft YTA, because it's not about the bidet function, but it's altered her comfort when using it as a regular toilet, as she said. You can try encourage her to tough it out for a little longer but at the end of that period of time, if she still doesn't like it, I would move it. If it was a bathroom you both shared, and she was using it as well as you, it would be fairer to move the bidet to the other bathroom. Bidets aren't that hard to uninstall and reinstall.", "I\u2019m not sure how old your wife is but if the question is choosing the bidet bathroom based on distance, even 10 feet can make a huge difference for some women as they get older.

Closest to her side of the bed, even.\nUnless you\u2019re both women, then just flip a coin.", "NAH but if the question is what you should do... you should move the bidet.\n\nThink of it this way: \n\nYour wife wants this specific toilet to be bidet-less.\n\nYou want to use a bidet (probably not EVERY bathroom visit, but some.) Ideally on this toilet, but having one at home is already a win regardless.\n\nIf you keep the bidet where it is, you get EVERYTHING you want, and your wife gets NOTHING she wants (and feels like you don't care about her feelings). If you move the bidet to the guest bathroom, your wife gets EVERYTHING she wants, and you get SOME of what you want (a bidet you can use when you want to, even if it's slightly less convenient.)\n\nTotal happiness is higher if you move the bidet.\n\nIf moving it is a pain, hire a handyman.", "YTA, dude you stand to pee, she has to sit on it every time.  Unless you sit and crap every time you use the toilet get rid of it.", "Maybe get one without the heated seat? Ours is just the water, and you use the original seat. The only difference is the little knobs to the side of the toilet, which wouldn\u2019t affect her use of the toilet, and you still have a bidet in the bathroom you prefer to use.", "Your wife's wishes should be followed, because she has to sit on the toilet more than you do, and it is uncomfortable for her. YTA.", "YTA just because it doesn't seem like there's any compromising with you.\n\n>Last week I convinced my wife to get a bidet.\n\nSo she didn't want the bidet, but she compromised and got one because you wanted it.\n\n\n>She wanted me to remove the bidet.\n\nYou're refusing to get rid of the bidet even though she doesn't like it.\n\n\n>So now, she's insisting that I move the bidet and all my stuff to the guest bathroom and use that instead\n\nShe tries to compromise.

You lowered her comfort level to rise yours. You changed the status quo and created the problem. You are the one who should have guest bathroom. I supposed you use the bidet function only for number 2, right? In avarage once a day? She sits down every single time. As a fairly short women I absolutely understand the hassle.

I love my bidet but it took me awhile to get used to the height.

The extra height combined with the seat tilt could make a huge difference.

Just that she does not want to deal with it.", "Flip that around and you\u2019ve got a good argument for him to move it. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing: it\u2019s a change to have a bidet, so the change should go to the spare bathroom. \n\nHere\u2019s the other thing: she sits down on the toilet every time, he does just when he is pooping. So she uses the toilet more and that should be taken into consideration.", "A too-high seat is really uncomfortable. If you have to have your feet up on tippy toes (or worse, can\u2019t even reach the floor) then that presses uncomfortably into the thighs and makes your feet go dead, especially if you\u2019re there for an \u2018extended visit\u2019.\n\nAlso changes the angle for pooping and makes it harder to push without straining.\n\nI would consider it a big deal tbh. I\u2019d hate it if my partner made a change to the bathroom that made it feel inaccessible to me.\n\nYou might consider getting her some kind of riser that compensates for the height? Something at the exact right height to raise her feet up enough to make up the difference that the bidet added? (Not like a kiddy stool that\u2019ll be too high. Like a monitor stand or something).", "Get a squatty potty. It would make the height difference irrelevant, plus would level up your pooping experience.", "Yup, those attachments are not that hard to install.", "That would require a certain amount of extra room and a lot of expensive plumbing work."]}
