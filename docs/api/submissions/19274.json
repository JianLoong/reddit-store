She wanted me to remove the bidet.\n\nI don't see why I should, since it's basically a regular toilet with the bidet settings off. She says that the seat is now too high and that it feels weird to lean back on it, but I don't really see the difference. I really like this bidet and it's been a real gamechanger for me.\n\nSo now, she's insisting that I move the bidet and all my stuff to the guest bathroom and use that instead, but I don't want to do that either since wouldn't it just make more sense for her to use the toilet in that room? Plus its a real hassle to uninstall and reinstall the bidet. But she says that it's my bidet, so it's my problem. We live in a one story home and our bathrooms are literally around the hall from one another. The only difference is that the bidet bathroom is really close to the bedroom.

I went back and forth in my verdict a few times. You're the AH - no, your wife is - no, you are - no, your wife is...\n\nSome comments:\n\n* You like what you like. You get used to what you get used to. I'm shorter than average, and I like a toilet that's just the right height for me. Not too low, because I am disabled and would have trouble getting up from it. Not too high, because I'd feel like I'm perched on a bar stool. If someone went in to my bathroom and adjusted the height of my toilet (in either direction) and I had to use it like that forever - yes, I'd be annoyed, and yes, I'd probably remind them about it a lot.\n* I have never actually seen one of those bidet seat things that sits over the toilet, but I'll take your word for it that it was a big deal to install it and it would be a colossal pain to uninstall. However, if you *can* uninstall it and reinstall it in the guest bathroom, you should. For every decision that affects you both, you should work on the two-yeses-one-no principle. (e.g. Should we get a dog? Two yeses = we should get a dog. One yes one no means no we shouldn't.) You wanted this bidet. You *convinced* your wife (your words) to get the bidet. It doesn't sound like she was keen, but you twisted her arm. Now she has tried it, she is even less keen, but your attitude seems to be: too bad, you're stuck with it.\n* You should both take a step backwards from this dispute and remind yourselves that you are immensely privileged to live in a two-bathroom home, where the two bathrooms are very close to each other. Never in my life have I lived in a house with more than one bathroom, and sometimes that house had as many as ten people crammed into it. I have also lived more than half my life in houses with no indoor toilet. That's a whole lot of fun when it's the middle of the night in winter and you need to pee.\n\nMy verdict: YTA. The person who deserves to walk a few extra steps to the bathroom with the bidet is you.\n\nIf it simply is not feasible to uninstall it and reinstall it in the guest bathroom, then your wife will need to be the one to walk the few extra steps.\n\nEither way, it's only a few steps. It's not going halfway down the yard in the middle of the night.", "YTA\n\nIf you want to modify a toilet to your liking, making it uncomfortable for her to use, then *you* should modify the guest bathroom.  Not the main bathroom that she uses.  \n\nWould you like it if the toilet you use was suddenly much shorter, putting your knees up in your chest and making you distinctly uncomfortable every time you use it?  She deserves to be comfortable in her own home and in her own bathroom.  If you want to introduce a change, and that change causes her extreme discomfort, the least you can do is implement that change in the secondary bathroom.", "YTA. It may be a TMI question, but how often do you poop? Not interested in your bowel health but the fact that women have to sit down to pee and poop. You just sit down to poop (I assume). So you expect her to be uncomfortable 100% if the time so you can use the bidet 20% of the time? Just move it.", "This isn't anout bidet.\n\n>that the seat is now too high and that it feels weird to lean back on it\n\nYour wife tells you the new toilet is too high for her to use comfortable. And you are not willing to change it back to the hight she can use safely.\n\n**INFO**:\n\n>I really like this bidet and it's been a real gamechanger for me\n\nBecause of the new higher hight or because of the water?", "Soft YTA, because it's not about the bidet function, but it's altered her comfort when using it as a regular toilet, as she said. You can try encourage her to tough it out for a little longer but at the end of that period of time, if she still doesn't like it, I would move it. If it was a bathroom you both shared, and she was using it as well as you, it would be fairer to move the bidet to the other bathroom. Bidets aren't that hard to uninstall and reinstall.", "I\u2019m not sure how old your wife is but if the question is choosing the bidet bathroom based on distance, even 10 feet can make a huge difference for some women as they get older. Basically, she should have the bidetless bathroom closest to the bedroom. Closest to her side of the bed, even.\nUnless you\u2019re both women, then just flip a coin.", "NAH but if the question is what you should do... you should move the bidet.\n\nThink of it this way: \n\nYour wife wants this specific toilet to be bidet-less.\n\nYou want to use a bidet (probably not EVERY bathroom visit, but some.) Ideally on this toilet, but having one at home is already a win regardless.\n\nIf you keep the bidet where it is, you get EVERYTHING you want, and your wife gets NOTHING she wants (and feels like you don't care about her feelings). If you move the bidet to the guest bathroom, your wife gets EVERYTHING she wants, and you get SOME of what you want (a bidet you can use when you want to, even if it's slightly less convenient.)\n\nTotal happiness is higher if you move the bidet.\n\nIf moving it is a pain, hire a handyman.", "YTA, dude you stand to pee, she has to sit on it every time.  Unless you sit and crap every time you use the toilet get rid of it.", "Maybe get one without the heated seat? Ours is just the water, and you use the original seat. The only difference is the little knobs to the side of the toilet, which wouldn\u2019t affect her use of the toilet, and you still have a bidet in the bathroom you prefer to use.", "Your wife's wishes should be followed, because she has to sit on the toilet more than you do, and it is uncomfortable for her. YTA.", "YTA just because it doesn't seem like there's any compromising with you.\n\n>Last week I convinced my wife to get a bidet.\n\nSo she didn't want the bidet, but she compromised and got one because you wanted it.\n\n\n>She wanted me to remove the bidet.\n\nYou're refusing to get rid of the bidet even though she doesn't like it.\n\n\n>So now, she's insisting that I move the bidet and all my stuff to the guest bathroom and use that instead\n\nShe tries to compromise. If you won't get rid of the bidet, she wants to at least have it moved out of the bathroom she uses most of the time.\n\n\nAnd let's see why you can't compromise:\n\n>I don't see why I should\n\n>I don't want to do that either \n\n\nYou really come off as someone so self-centered that you can't even fathom why you would compromise to make your wife happy. Move your bidet into the other bathroom.", "yta\n\nyou seem selfish, just caring what you like and you want instead of compromising to move the bidet.", "YTA. You are being selfish. You lowered her comfort level to rise yours. You changed the status quo and created the problem. You are the one who should have guest bathroom. I supposed you use the bidet function only for number 2, right? In avarage once a day? She sits down every single time. As a fairly short women I absolutely understand the hassle. Plus having a bathroom closer to bedroom is more convenient during periods (IMO I'm not going into details).", "YTA, your wife is right, and since you're lucky enough to have two bathrooms just suck it up and move it", "NAH. I love my bidet but it took me awhile to get used to the height. Ask your wife to try it for a little longer (set a date) and if she still hasn\u2019t gotten accustomed to it by then, move it to the guest bathroom. Because there are no outlets in my master bath\u2019s toilet nook, my bidet is installed on a different floor. I will simply walk downstairs if I want the luxe toileting experience, lol.", "NTA, it's weird to me when people don't want to use a bidet. I've had one for like 5 years now and I can't poop without it. Your wife is weird, if she doesn't like it she doesn't have to use it. I get the thing about the seat being higher, but she can get used to it, it's not a huge inconvenience (like it would be for you to un-install and re-install it).", "Wait, who leans back when they are using the toilet????", "Nta I've got one too and my butthole has never been cleaner. Your wife is being selfish and controlling. She doesn't have to use it.

Everyone should be using a bidet seriously", "If wife hates it so much then let her walk to the guest room to poop.  I'd be on cloud nine if hubby installed one on our toilet.

It's a cheaper model that doesn't change the seat height, at all, and it works.  I guess OP could go get a bidet like ours, so it's in the master bath and also doesn't make his wife uncomfortable.

Depends on how the toilet is situated. I\u2019ve had bidets in two houses now and while one house has\nplenty of room for such an endeavor, the other was damn near impossible to do for an average size adult.", "Agreed. The extra height combined with the seat tilt could make a huge difference. Humans aren't built to shit standing up (though many people manage it) but crouching - our rectal muscles only line up fully when our ass is tucked under us - which means that it can be physically difficult to unload your faeces with a toilet that's too high and/or has a seat tilting your pelvis forward.", "He\u2019s the one that wanted the bidet. He added something extra to the toilet, she don\u2019t like it, so he should return the toilet to its original condition. The is no special circumstance here to justify him adding the bidet.
