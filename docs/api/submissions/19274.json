I really like this bidet and it's been a real gamechanger for me.\n\nSo now, she's insisting that I move the bidet and all my stuff to the guest bathroom and use that instead, but I don't want to do that either since wouldn't it just make more sense for her to use the toilet in that room? Plus its a real hassle to uninstall and reinstall the bidet. But she says that it's my bidet, so it's my problem.

I went back and forth in my verdict a few times. You're the AH - no, your wife is - no, you are - no, your wife is...\n\nSome comments:\n\n* You like what you like. You get used to what you get used to. I'm shorter than average, and I like a toilet that's just the right height for me. Not too low, because I am disabled and would have trouble getting up from it. Not too high, because I'd feel like I'm perched on a bar stool. If someone went in to my bathroom and adjusted the height of my toilet (in either direction) and I had to use it like that forever - yes, I'd be annoyed, and yes, I'd probably remind them about it a lot.\n* I have never actually seen one of those bidet seat things that sits over the toilet, but I'll take your word for it that it was a big deal to install it and it would be a colossal pain to uninstall. However, if you *can* uninstall it and reinstall it in the guest bathroom, you should. For every decision that affects you both, you should work on the two-yeses-one-no principle. (e.g. Should we get a dog? Two yeses = we should get a dog. One yes one no means no we shouldn't.) You wanted this bidet. You *convinced* your wife (your words) to get the bidet. It doesn't sound like she was keen, but you twisted her arm. Now she has tried it, she is even less keen, but your attitude seems to be: too bad, you're stuck with it.\n* You should both take a step backwards from this dispute and remind yourselves that you are immensely privileged to live in a two-bathroom home, where the two bathrooms are very close to each other. Never in my life have I lived in a house with more than one bathroom, and sometimes that house had as many as ten people crammed into it. I have also lived more than half my life in houses with no indoor toilet. That's a whole lot of fun when it's the middle of the night in winter and you need to pee.\n\nMy verdict: YTA. The person who deserves to walk a few extra steps to the bathroom with the bidet is you.\n\nIf it simply is not feasible to uninstall it and reinstall it in the guest bathroom, then your wife will need to be the one to walk the few extra steps.\n\nEither way, it's only a few steps. It's not going halfway down the yard in the middle of the night.", "YTA\n\nIf you want to modify a toilet to your liking, making it uncomfortable for her to use, then *you* should modify the guest bathroom.  Not the main bathroom that she uses.  \n\nWould you like it if the toilet you use was suddenly much shorter, putting your knees up in your chest and making you distinctly uncomfortable every time you use it?  She deserves to be comfortable in her own home and in her own bathroom.  If you want to introduce a change, and that change causes her extreme discomfort, the least you can do is implement that change in the secondary bathroom.", "YTA. It may be a TMI question, but how often do you poop? Not interested in your bowel health but the fact that women have to sit down to pee and poop. You just sit down to poop (I assume). So you expect her to be uncomfortable 100% if the time so you can use the bidet 20% of the time? Just move it.", "This isn't about bidet.\n\n>that the seat is now too high and that it feels weird to lean back on it\n\nYour wife tells you the new toilet is too high for her to use comfortable. And you are not willing to change it back to the hight she can use safely.\n\n**INFO**:\n\n>I really like this bidet and it's been a real gamechanger for me\n\nBecause of the new higher hight or because of the water?\n\nEdit: typo", "Soft YTA, because it's not about the bidet function, but it's altered her comfort when using it as a regular toilet, as she said. You can try encourage her to tough it out for a little longer but at the end of that period of time, if she still doesn't like it, I would move it. If it was a bathroom you both shared, and she was using it as well as you, it would be fairer to move the bidet to the other bathroom. Bidets aren't that hard to uninstall and reinstall.", "I\u2019m not sure how old your wife is but if the question is choosing the bidet bathroom based on distance, even 10 feet can make a huge difference for some women as they get older.

Ideally on this toilet, but having one at home is already a win regardless.\n\nIf you keep the bidet where it is, you get EVERYTHING you want, and your wife gets NOTHING she wants (and feels like you don't care about her feelings).

Unless you sit and crap every time you use the toilet get rid of it.", "Maybe get one without the heated seat? Ours is just the water, and you use the original seat.

You lowered her comfort level to rise yours. You changed the status quo and created the problem. You are the one who should have guest bathroom.

So she uses the toilet more and that should be taken into consideration.", "A too-high seat is really uncomfortable. If you have to have your feet up on tippy toes (or worse, can\u2019t even reach the floor) then that presses uncomfortably into the thighs and makes your feet go dead, especially if you\u2019re there for an \u2018extended visit\u2019.\n\nAlso changes the angle for pooping and makes it harder to push without straining.\n\nI would consider it a big deal tbh. I\u2019d hate it if my partner made a change to the bathroom that made it feel inaccessible to me.\n\nYou might consider getting her some kind of riser that compensates for the height? Something at the exact right height to raise her feet up enough to make up the difference that the bidet added? (Not like a kiddy stool that\u2019ll be too high. Like a monitor stand or something).", "Get a squatty potty. It would make the height difference irrelevant, plus would level up your pooping experience.", "Yup, those attachments are not that hard to install.", "That would require a certain amount of extra room and a lot of expensive plumbing work.", "Well, here\u2019s the thing:\n\nOne person is physically uncomfortable \n\nThe other doesn\u2019t want to do a task that would fix the discomfort caused by something this same person wanted more than the first one.\n\nYTA, not so much an AH, because it\u2019s not that deep, but you are more in the wrong", "YTA. You're the one who instigated the change, and your wife is the one who is being inconvenienced by it and now even using the toilet at all is uncomfortable for her. Add to that the fact that she sits every time she uses the loo, while you stand most of the times that you use it, so her discomfort is greater.\n\nSwap it out. Despite your exaggerations, it's not that difficult. You just don't want to do it.", "She needs to adjust the spray position and pressure to suit her preference\u2026 mine has user1 and user2 settings, female parts are different and your sandblasting probably doesn\u2019t feel good.\n\nYTA just move to the guest room. But she should love it because they are awesome and no one ever goes back. Seems like there is a block in your communication elsewhere.\n\nA squattypotty could help with height.", "I mean, this is tough, but in the end, YTA.  If she really doesn't like it and it doesn't fit her right, you should move it to the other bathroom.  But I can tell you this, I don't trust anyone who says they don't like a bidet with a heated seat.  I hate going to the bathroom outside of my house, walking around with a dirty ass.  I can feel the difference, and it's just gross!  Move the bidet and enjoy your warm clean ass.", "I'm a bit biased here, because not cleaning your backside after taking a poop is objectively filthy. There's also the reality that while change is always a bit difficult, there's a good chance she won't even notice it after a few months, unless it is uncomfortably high. That said, good communication is the answer. The bidet is probably not worth your (or her) mental health, or the strain on your marriage. I would consider asking if you can set a trial time, and leave it for a couple of months to see if she gets used to it. If she hates it, she can use the guest bath in the interim and you can move it and start using the guest bath then.\n\nEither way, NAH. It's just a toilet seat after all.", "YTA \n\nShe tried the thing out FOR YOU and she didn\u2019t like it. Now it\u2019s time to move on. She\u2019s using that seat 100% of the time shes in bathroom. You only use when you need to take a dump which is like what 20% of the time? Move the bidet. Move it to the guest bathroom and take your dumps in there if you like it so much. She deserves comfort when she\u2019s on the toilet just as much as you do .", "YTA - and this is such a silly thing to let cause division in your marriage.  As others have mentioned, she sits all the time and is likely shorter. You like the bidet but are the one changing the status quo from the main bathroom. Just move the bidet and your business to the other bathroom for the sake of harmony in your marriage.", "YTA but only mildly. You could get a thick mat to place under the toilet to compensate for the added inch.", "I can't imagine why your wife doesn't want a clean butt but there it is. As for the height issue she can buy a stool made especially for use with a toilet.\n\nWhat an odd thing for her to not like.", "NAH... I love my bidet from costco! My husband is afraid of the water but loves the heated seat and night light. \n\nI think you wife doesnt like the change. I'd just offer to be the one to keep that toilet and bathroom clean in exchange for keeping your preference. Maybe offer to upgrade the other toilet seat to her preferences. \n\nYou might consider moving it to the other bathroom. If all her toiletries are by this toilet, you should be accommodating. I'm guessing she uses the toilet more and having all your menstrual supplies handy key. \n\nNote on installation: the ease of installing has to do with the size and shape of toilet, and where the electrical plugs are situated. You dont want the chord to cross the room to the vanity...", "OMG dude, your wife has to sit down 100% of the time. ONE HUNDRED PERCENT.\n\nUnless you are a sitzpinkler (no shame in that btw), then you should move the seat and take the extra steps. \n\nHonestly, you sound like a bit of a self-justifying A. \n\nYTA.", "NTA. In my country most of us have bidets in our bathrooms anyways. It\u2019s far more hygienic. Keep your bidet.", "NAH, neither of you is wrong to like what you like, it was installed with her agreement, presumably, into the master bathroom, it CAN be used by either of you in the case of being desperate (just as the other one can) and there is nothing that suggests one of yours comfort deserves to be more of a priority than the other's in terms of additional need. Now if it is a mobility issue stopping her getting to the other one without difficulty, or if she has bladder or bowel issues that warrants her being closer to the toilet during the night, that's different, but otherwise it's a coin toss as to whose wants should take priority, but since it is already installed it seems unnecessary to faff around uninstalling it and then reinstalling the old one in the master before taking the other toilet out and reinstalling the bidet in the guest bathroom instead. Fine if that was in the original agreement but I don't see why hubby's wants should be lesser than those of the wife (I am a wife, we just had a load of work done on the house ourselves and frankly I am all for keeping the faffery to a minimum when it isn't essential, life is enough of a headache without playing musical toilets!)", "Nah. Figure it out it's not a big deal", "NTA, we have a similar bidet seat. It\u2019s not really any different than a regular seat. It\u2019s Not any higher than normal seat either.", "But the wife agreed to the bidet, then changed her mind. Considering the extra cost and effort involved in moving it, since she's the one that changed her mind, shouldn't she be the one to take the few extra steps?", "Where did you read that the master bathroom is hers and the guest bathroom is his?", "People masturbate on the toilet by shooting water up their ass to turn their bathroom into a \"pleasure room\"?", "He's the one who wanted the bidet in the first place. So yes, the responsibility falls on him. He introduced a new problem to their household that never existed before. He *created* the issue they're now facing.", "If she had *enthusiastically* agreed to it, sure. But OP specifically says he \"convinced her\", which does imply she never wanted the bidet and only agreed to shut him up.\n\nIf things worked the way you think they should, anyone would be able to strong-arm their partner into *anything* they don't want, then force *them* to deal with the consequences when - shocker - it turns out they were serious about not wanting it. I think that's problematic, personally. None of this would've happened if OP had listened the first several times his wife said no.", "Could y\u2019all get a squatty potty?  I got a nice clear acrylic one, and I love it.", "The comments state that his wife wanted him to move it from the bathroom he installed it in to the guest room along with his stuff.  He states the bathroom that he initially installed the bidet in was really close to the bedroom", "Convinced doesn't mean beat into submission. It sounds like she was on the fence about it from his other posts. She even mentioned that it could be useful while she was on her period and was willing to try it.\n\nYou're taking a wild leap, both in your wrong assumption (based on OP's other comments) of how much convincing the wife took and how I think things should work.", "Ok, but how does that make the bathroom attached to the master bedroom HERS while delegating the guest bathroom as HIS?", "Huh? Why would it be necessary to uninstall and reinstall toilets when a bidet seat is literally a removable part that was ordered separately?", "It belonged to both until she told him to go to the guest room with his stuff", "Others have laid out why you\u2019re being a moderate YTA here. Why not put it in the guest room and install a hand sprayer type in the main one? That makes it completely optional. You can get them hooked up to have warm water.", "YTA.  Your opinion of it isn't more important than hers.  Additionally, she likely pees much more frequently than you poop, so her experience with it actually should carry more weight.", "Oof people are acting like men ONLY stand when they pee as plenty of men don't prefer to sit. \n\nJust because he doesn't \"have\" to doesn't mean he *will* it's more hygienic to sit anyways", "Who tf doesn\u2019t like using a bidet?", "NAH  you want it.  She does not.  You have two bathrooms.  You're the one instituting this change, move it to the guest bathroom and make that \"your\" bathroom.  Problem solved.", "Offer to eat her out more often if she uses it. I dunno ESH.\nShe is likely just offended.", "NTA  \nBecause of a slightly higher seat? Oh lordy, she can just walk to the other bathroom. Her request is unreasonable and you're trying to be more hygenic.", "NTA. It\u2019s a normal toilet seat if you don\u2019t click a button. \n\nNow go and complete your throne by getting a Squatty Potty\u2026 It will also help with your wife\u2019s stance about the seat height", "NTA.  I have had bidets for years.  Unless it's a very unusual bidet, they generally don't change the seat itself at all.  They can be moved, but it isn't easy, especially with one that has a heated seat and special features.  The easiest option is for her to use the other toilet, and that does sound the best.", "Does everyone know why men need a bidet more than women?\n\nMen have different equipment, obviously.  It's harder for them to clean their backside because their equipment is in the way.\n\nSo ladies, guess where men are cleaning their backsides  when they don't have a bidet? IN THE SHOWER. So your toilet is a bit higher but you won't have shit in the shower. \n\nWe installed a higher seat toilet for my husband who has bad knees. It was odd at first but not uncomfortable.  NTA", "NTA. Reading these comments most of these folks have never even seen a bidet let alone sit or use one. They are awesome and I wish every toilet had one. Most bidets I use barely effect how the toilet seat feels since I don't have the fancy heated seat (I'm jelly BTW) but it's crazy that it's so high off the ground she can't use the toilet properly (unless she's like a little person). I think that's a weak excuse for a clean booty. If the heated seat height is the issue I'd just swap back to the old seat but get the bidet that fits under it (win/win). Also I've sat on many toilet seats of varying heights and never had issues going... Is this like really an issue?", "If these comments were coming from outside of America in places where people actually practice better hygiene I'm sure the comments would be different\n\nPeople make it sound like they add a damn foot of height to the toilet when it doesn't \ud83d\ude44 she's not uncomfortable she's just not used to it, it's like using a toilet in a different Building/home after while you realize there's nothing wrong with it it just felt different than yours at first", "NTA. You\u2019re missing a loving wife?", "NTA.", "NTA, get her a stool for her feet.", "NTA\n\nAll these people calling you the AH, did they miss that there\u2019s another toilet just around the corner? Fiddling with the plumbing and all that is way more of a hassle than just using the other toilet.\n\nMy bf installed a bidet in the master bath and I\u2019m not a huge fan (for some reason no matter what I do it seems like it\u2019s moving things upstream from one exit to the other in a way that does not improve hygiene). It makes the seat less comfortable for me, so I just use the other bathroom most of the time. Not hard.", "YTA but only if this is the hill you choose to die on. It's not like she was as gung ho about it as you in the first place. You are the one who got to spend the money on the thing you wanted, so I think it's fair that she gets to have the toilet the way she wants it. And like others have said, she sits more than you so it affects her more.", "If it\u2019s the Moen seat from Costco, which I bought (heated seat, connects to warm water line), it didn\u2019t raise the height of the seat at all. And I\u2019m a 5\u20192\u201d woman with a 6\u20192\u201d husband. Of course, it\u2019s possible their original toilet seat was thinner than our original seat.\n\nThe wife\u2019s position just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. I\u2019m trying to think of a toilet where installing a bidet seat would significantly raise the seat and I cannot. I want more INFO but I don\u2019t think OP can provide it, so I say NAH.", "Right? OP convinced her to TRY it - not to commit to it for life. She tried it and didn\u2019t like it. Now he\u2019s refusing to change it back. \n\nGood luck getting your wife to try anything again OP. You\u2019ve just taught her that you only care about getting your way.", "You're right. My husband sits when he pees. Men are also inclined to read a lot on the throne. I know, women, too. OPs wife is being a diva. An inch or two rise is nothing.", "Personally as bidets aren\u2019t universal here yet, I would not burden myself or my guests by having it in the guest bathroom.", "Not if he\u2019s the one using it only 20% of the time compared to her 100%. Since it\u2019s only \u201ca few extra steps\u201d HE should have no problem taking them when he ONLY needs to take a dump, compared to her who would have to do it EVERY SINGLE TIME.", "My feet can\u2019t be flat on the ground when I use the toilet, I\u2019m too short. I\u2019m either on my tippy toes or my feet just dangle and it\u2019s so uncomfortable. I use a squatty potty to solve this issue but if my husband made our toilet even higher by \u201can inch-ish\u201d my feet wouldn\u2019t touch the ground at all and I\u2019d be so irritated. \n\nIt\u2019s a really annoying feeling to have your feet dangling when you use the toilet like you\u2019re a little kid.", "That looks like a regular toilet seat... Like dafuq I was expecting like 5 inches of padding or something.", "Right??? Better hygiene > your one inch \"discomfort\" that you can get over in a day", "Can confirm the too high seat is uncomfortable. I\u2019m potty training my 3 year old and he tells me, after maybe one minute, on the actual toilet and not his training potty (that is low to the ground and doubles as a stool for washing hands) that his legs hurt. The toilet in his and his brother\u2019s bathroom is admittedly tall (taller than my and my husband\u2019s by a good 2-3 inches). Never thought about how difficult it might be to use it until my 3 old told me his legs hurt. So now we put the little potty/stool in front of the big toilet and it helps him be more comfortable although he still prefers the little potty and I can\u2019t blame him for that since his legs actually reach the floor then.", "Why doesn't he get to tell her to take her stuff to the guest bathroom then?  I'm just failing to see how, with two people cohabitating in a shared space, that you just get to say that it's HER bathroom because she says so.", "He can or refuse altogether to go to the guest room. I was going by the facts stated", "Again, why is it a FACT that the master bathroom is hers just because she says so?  It's a FACT that they both live in and share the same space, so why is her unilaterally deciding who gets which space a FACT?", "That was my assumption from what I read.  If you read it differently that is fine too. Not everyone reads the same in these acenarios", "I guess?\n\nThey share two bathrooms\n\nHe buys a bidet and loves it\n\nShe doesn't love it\n\nShe tells him to use the other bathroom\n\nHe tells HER to use the other bathroom\n\nNot sure what complexity I'm missing here.\n\nWhy does her preference win out over his just because she says so?"]}
