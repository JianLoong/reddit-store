My cousin Sam is getting married early next year to his fiancee Jane. Amy and Jane don't get along too well, they're fine in family events and stuff but they don't run in the same circles otherwise. Amy's mentioned before that Jane doesn't want to be a part of their group and she's too shy.\n\nAmy saw what Jane's dress looks like, from another cousin. I haven't seen it but it's custom made, white and gold, and she thinks it's too much. The issue now is that Amy's come up with the idea to wear her wedding dress to Sam and Jane's wedding. She said she doesn't have time to go dress shopping, and her dress isn't traditional white (it's pink).\n\nI said no, she can't wear her wedding dress to someone else's wedding, but she's insisting. I told her if she insists on wearing this dress, she doesn't have to attend.\n\nAmy got really upset and said I'm trying to control her, and her dress should be reused instead of sitting in the closet.\n\nThis has blown up, and I just don't think you should wear your wedding dress to another wedding, regardless of if it's white or not? I don't think I'm the AH but Amy is mad, she told her friend and the friend also said I can't tell her if she attends or not.\n\nETA: I've been looking online and I found [this picture](https://www.brides.com/thmb/8KF1vGngmrwRVE1n3IWukhHwovo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/anne-barge-nantucket-sq-f76db7e2d9744b8092deb94d7493eb70.jpg) that's similar to my wife's dress.

It is not Amy's place to make a comment on the gown, or Jane's choices by wearing her pink wedding dress.\n\nVery likely OPs whole family will be at this wedding.  They will recognize the dress and it will likely damage her relationship with OPs family because they will see her for a petty witch...

She decided she wanted to wear her wedding dress after seeing what the bride-to-be's wedding dress looks like. This is spiteful and if she feels that way she'd be better off not attending.", "NTA. Wearing your wedding dress to someone else's wedding doesn't send a good message.

But not at a wedding that is not hers.", "NTA.  It sounds like Amy might be trying to passive-aggressively bully Jane. She thinks Jane\u2019s dress is too much and that Jane is too shy? Neither of these things are any of her business and put together with the wedding dress situation; sounds like your wife being petty and jealous.", "NTA.  Amy is TA.  It is rude to even think about wearing her wedding dress to someone else's wedding.   Perhaps the bride could handle the situation better.    Telling her might make things worse.", "NTA man...what a mean thing to do.", "Your wife sounds dreadful. Time to formally uninvite her.

She\u2019s trying to ruin your cousin\u2019s wedding day and that\u2019s her AH argument???\n\nAs a woman, I can tell you I would NEVER wear white, off white, light pink (as seen in that pic) of any other color close to white to a wedding. That\u2019s just WRONG and asking for attention. Want to know who wore white to my wedding? My husband\u2019s \u201ccrazy\u201d aunt who is a notorious attention seeking drama queen. I was PISSED but didn\u2019t acknowledge it on the day.

Jane\u2019s wedding dress is too much, I should show her what a tasteful gown looks like. (I understand she didn\u2019t actually say that but it was heavily implied) \n4.

Even without the link to the example dress, your wife is still in the wrong. She's being petty and childish, and you should warn Jane about your wife's behavior.", "NTA. Your wife is being spiteful.

What a crappy thing to do just because you don\u2019t like someone", "NTA  \nEven if the dress doesn't look like a traditional wedding dress and could be reused, it's odd that she would do it at a wedding only a few months after your own. Possibly the first wedding you'll be attending after it.

Tell the bride and expect for your wife to be uninvited.\n\nI suggest that you take your wife somewhere far away that weekend to inhibit her from blowing up Amy\u2019s day.\n\nWRT you.  You are married to this grenade.  She is telling you who she is - BELIEVE her.", "NTA. Amy is deliberately trying to get a dig at Jane. She's passed judgement on the wedding dress (and Jane by the sounds of it) and so is looking to hurt Jane, or at the very least get attention on someone else's day.\n\nBest case scenario is your wife is incredibly dense, tone deaf and manipulative. Worst case, your wife has decided to deliberately and knowingly hurt someone.", ">The issue now is that Amy's come up with the idea to wear her wedding dress to Sam and Jane's wedding.

But that picture is distinctly a wedding dress. \n\nShe's just lost her invite to that wedding. She could try to smuggle it in wearing something else and change into it later, she sounds like she is determined to wear this dress. Tell her she can NOT come, under any circumstances, and tell the bride why she is uninvited. \n\nAnd maybe reconsider why you're with someone this petty and obsessive?", "NTA. It would take less than one day to search for a dress that's appropriate for a wedding.

She needs to grow up", "NTA obviously no one here knows what the dress looks like but it\u2019s fancy enough in your eyes to think \u201chmm maybe not the best idea to wear that\u201d.

You\u2019re wife\u2019s reaction will be telling if she\u2019s mad at you then she clearly is out to hurt your cousin and why do you want to be with someone who is out to maliciously out to hurt your family. If she\u2019s mad at your cousin then she genuinely thinks it\u2019s ok to wear this dress to another wedding.

I think this is a similar scenario, where is not so much how the dress looks but why its being worn, because if she wants to reuse it that's ok. But why here? Why a wedding? There will be other formal events where this won't be an issue and won't ruffle any feathers.\n\nAlso even if family and friends didn't go to the wedding, I assume pictures were shared and they know of this dress.

But, again, it just looks like a semi-formal party dress and nothing like a traditional wedding gown.", "This is what I\u2019d do, tell the groom and let him determine if he should handle it or tell his fianc\u00e9. I wasn\u2019t a super stressed bride but my sister wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle that. So it all depends. \n\nBut you have to tell someone because that dress is so obviously a wedding dress!", "Yeah, my wedding was tiny (16 people, including a 5month baby), we did maybe 5 or 6 pictures. If you weren't there there is a 99% chance you would never guess it was my wedding dress if I wore it out.", "Don't mean to offend but I hope you know that your wife is a villain.", "Oh my goodness that\u2019s AWESOME and she seems like someone I would want to be friends with!", "The accusation of control is straight up gaslighting and a massive red flag.", "My stbx didn\u2019t remove his mask until the kids were born. It\u2019s horrifying.", "The bride should definitely be informed. The wife showing up in the wedding dress will will noticeable and affect the wedding", "How did you marry this wretched woman? She sounds like an awful jealous bully, you should leave her home and not allow her to attempt to ruin your cousins and his wife\u2019s day with her jealousy and psycho behaviour. Does her behaviour not worry you for your future?", ">she didn't expect Jane to end up with my cousin\n\nTranslation: Amy doesn't think Jane is worthy of your cousin.\n\nAnd from this and other comments, it sounds like the reasoning is that Amy believes she herself has married into a particular class / wealth bracket, and Jane is 'beneath you'. She's essentially trying to put Jane 'in her place' (can't have a such a fancy dress Jane, you're not worthy of it).\n\nReally not a great look - and for the record, telling your wife she can't attend a family wedding in her wedding dress is *not* controlling, you are NTA *at all*.", "I don't think she thinks Jane is not good enough. I think she knows SHE'S (Amy) not good enough. And that only one can succeed in the quest of social elevation. She despise Jane for being herself and still managing to \"have it all\". All of this is very very very deeply internalized misogyny. \n\nOP, your wife is kinda the worst. Sorry.", "This story lives rent free in my head!", "There was another one with just the mil where they made the wedding party wear white and the bride wear pink, too, it\u2019s a different story. That\u2019s what the other poster was talking about. \n\nThat said, that sounds epic lol", " Take the wife's wedding dress and hide it until after the wedding. Preferably at another location that is not your home. \n\nTelling other people does not seem like enough to stop her.", "Blush is pink but it\u2019s not the sort of pink you could get away with wearing to a wedding.", "It\u2019d be a welcome guest for me!", "I got a lovely satin dress of Amazon for the last event. It has thousands of reviews and real people pictures. Looks like it was made for me when I put it on.", "A fine ambition, although possibly without burying four husbands.", " Depends, do I have to wait till they are dead to bury them?"]}
