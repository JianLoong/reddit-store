My cousin Sam is getting married early next year to his fiancee Jane. Amy and Jane don't get along too well, they're fine in family events and stuff but they don't run in the same circles otherwise. Amy's mentioned before that Jane doesn't want to be a part of their group and she's too shy.\n\nAmy saw what Jane's dress looks like, from another cousin. I haven't seen it but it's custom made, white and gold, and she thinks it's too much. The issue now is that Amy's come up with the idea to wear her wedding dress to Sam and Jane's wedding. She said she doesn't have time to go dress shopping, and her dress isn't traditional white (it's pink).\n\nI said no, she can't wear her wedding dress to someone else's wedding, but she's insisting. I told her if she insists on wearing this dress, she doesn't have to attend.\n\nAmy got really upset and said I'm trying to control her, and her dress should be reused instead of sitting in the closet.\n\nThis has blown up, and I just don't think you should wear your wedding dress to another wedding, regardless of if it's white or not? I don't think I'm the AH but Amy is mad, she told her friend and the friend also said I can't tell her if she attends or not.\n\nETA: I've been looking online and I found [this picture](https://www.brides.com/thmb/8KF1vGngmrwRVE1n3IWukhHwovo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/anne-barge-nantucket-sq-f76db7e2d9744b8092deb94d7493eb70.jpg) that's similar to my wife's dress.

Of course she's seen Amy's dress and would know what it was.  Amy thinks Jane's wedding dress is \"too much\".  It's a wedding dress, they're supposed to be too much!   It is not Amy's place to make a comment on the gown, or Jane's choices by wearing her pink wedding dress.\n\nVery likely OPs whole family will be at this wedding.  They will recognize the dress and it will likely damage her relationship with OPs family because they will see her for a petty witch...

Wearing your wedding dress to someone else's wedding doesn't send a good message.

Suggest to your wife to get it cut short like a cocktail dress- if she\u2019s that adamant that it needs to be reused, then a cocktail dress would be more wearable than a wedding gown.

But not at a wedding that is not hers.", "NTA.  It sounds like Amy might be trying to passive-aggressively bully Jane. She thinks Jane\u2019s dress is too much and that Jane is too shy? Neither of these things are any of her business and put together with the wedding dress situation; sounds like your wife being petty and jealous.", "NTA.  Amy is TA.  It is rude to even think about wearing her wedding dress to someone else's wedding.   Perhaps the bride could handle the situation better.    Telling her might make things worse.", "NTA man...what a mean thing to do.", "Your wife sounds dreadful. Time to formally uninvite her.

She\u2019s trying to ruin your cousin\u2019s wedding day and that\u2019s her AH argument???\n\nAs a woman, I can tell you I would NEVER wear white, off white, light pink (as seen in that pic) of any other color close to white to a wedding. That\u2019s just WRONG and asking for attention. Want to know who wore white to my wedding? My husband\u2019s \u201ccrazy\u201d aunt who is a notorious attention seeking drama queen. I was PISSED but didn\u2019t acknowledge it on the day.

I have reworn my wedding dress several times, but it\u2019s a navy cocktail dress. That dress is definitely bride-ish. If they don\u2019t get along, why does Amy want to go so bad?

Jane\u2019s wedding dress is too much, I should show her what a tasteful gown looks like. (I understand she didn\u2019t actually say that but it was heavily implied) \n4.

Even without the link to the example dress, your wife is still in the wrong. She's being petty and childish, and you should warn Jane about your wife's behavior.", "NTA. Your wife is being spiteful.

What a crappy thing to do just because you don\u2019t like someone", "NTA  \nEven if the dress doesn't look like a traditional wedding dress and could be reused, it's odd that she would do it at a wedding only a few months after your own. Possibly the first wedding you'll be attending after it.

Tell the bride and expect for your wife to be uninvited.\n\nI suggest that you take your wife somewhere far away that weekend to inhibit her from blowing up Amy\u2019s day.\n\nWRT you.  You are married to this grenade.  She is telling you who she is - BELIEVE her.", "NTA. Amy is deliberately trying to get a dig at Jane. She's passed judgement on the wedding dress (and Jane by the sounds of it) and so is looking to hurt Jane, or at the very least get attention on someone else's day.\n\nBest case scenario is your wife is incredibly dense, tone deaf and manipulative. Worst case, your wife has decided to deliberately and knowingly hurt someone.", ">The issue now is that Amy's come up with the idea to wear her wedding dress to Sam and Jane's wedding. She said she doesn't have time to go dress shopping, and her dress isn't traditional white (it's pink).\n\nAs I understand it, that's a huge no-no in Western culture, which I'm assuming you are. But that picture is distinctly a wedding dress. \n\nShe's just lost her invite to that wedding. She could try to smuggle it in wearing something else and change into it later, she sounds like she is determined to wear this dress. Tell her she can NOT come, under any circumstances, and tell the bride why she is uninvited. \n\nAnd maybe reconsider why you're with someone this petty and obsessive?", "NTA. It would take less than one day to search for a dress that's appropriate for a wedding.

She needs to grow up", "NTA obviously no one here knows what the dress looks like but it\u2019s fancy enough in your eyes to think \u201chmm maybe not the best idea to wear that\u201d.

I haven't seen it but it's custom made, white and gold, and she thinks it's too much. The issue now is that Amy's come up with the idea to wear her wedding dress to Sam and Jane's wedding. She said she doesn't have time to go dress shopping, and her dress isn't traditional white (it's pink).\n\nI said no, she can't wear her wedding dress to someone else's wedding, but she's insisting. I told her if she insists on wearing this dress, she doesn't have to attend.\n\nAmy got really upset and said I'm trying to control her, and her dress should be reused instead of sitting in the closet. \n\nThis has blown up, and I just don't think you should wear your wedding dress to another wedding, regardless of if it's white or not?

There will be other formal events where this won't be an issue and won't ruffle any feathers.\n\nAlso even if family and friends didn't go to the wedding, I assume pictures were shared and they know of this dress.

Is unnecessary drama.", "I'm split on whether to bother the bride with it before the wedding or get it sorted without it having any chance to impact her enjoyment of the wedding.\n\nLet the groom handle it and tell the bride after the honeymoon, maybe?", "His whole family seeing his wife act this way will ruin their relationship. Seems like his family is close.", "Oh wow", "Hmm, strange, it's still not working for me.", "This is some weird mean girl power play va your wife is pulling here man. Are Jane and your wife from like drastically different backgrounds? Whether it\u2019s financial/social, religious, or racial? \u201cNo one expected Jane to end up like this\u201d is kind of an interesting and specific way to phrase that. Whatever the reason your wife needs to grow up. Maybe consider encouraging her to seek some therapy to at minimum figure out what this competitive mean streak she has is about.", "Your wife sounds like an angry highschooler", "Your wife sounds jealous & like she's a mean girl. She's coming up with reasons in her own head to justify her terrible behavior. It almost sounds like she's holding a grudge over a guy she liked in college liking Jane instead with how she talks, too. I'm just getting a weird vibe from everything you've described. Inform your cousin, Jane, whoever you need to about what your wife's planning to wear & that you've told her not to or don't come so they're aware. She won't be happy about you exposing her, but it might finally snap some sense into her when everyone lets her know she's out of line for how she's behaving.", "I'd definitely want to know.  Either so I could tell her to do what she wants and have everyone laugh at her for wearing her wedding dress or just tell her to stay home.", "Bummer! Ah, well. Think very structured corset style top, thin straps, big puffy skirt slit up to the hip in front of one leg, very pale pink.", "Enter \"anne-barge-nantucket-sq-f76db7e2d9744b8092deb94d7493eb70.jpg\" into the google search and it shows them.", "No on the backgrounds question. Jane's always been kind of quiet and shy, they had mutual friends in college and according to Amy she didn't have a boyfriend, wouldn't go to social events, dances, etc. My family is well off, pretty successful, and Amy said she didn't expect Jane to end up with my cousin", "I would too but some of us would not. Maybe letting a council of the people who know her best decide is an option? Or asking the bride \"If someone was trying to upstage you at your wedding, would you like to know or would you like us to handle it quietly?\"", "Thanks, that did it!\n\nAlso, that definitely looks like a wedding dress to me!", "Whoop there it is. It\u2019s not about the difference in her background with Jane. It\u2019s probably about her new perceived self status. She doesn\u2019t think Jane is good enough for your family or your family\u2019s money. Obviously take my opinion with a grain of salt I\u2019m still an internet stranger but that\u2019s probably he most solid reasoning you\u2019ll come up with until she says something to indicate otherwise"]}
