Two girls and a boy. Our youngest is the boy, he\u2019s just over a year old. \nMy husbands brother, we\u2019ll call him Uncle G, is married with four girls 2-7yo. They have always wanted a boy and continue having babies in hopes they\u2019ll have a boy, so far no luck. \n\nEver since having our youngest son Uncle G has antagonized him every time we\u2019ve seen him which is roughly once a month since Baby J was about two months old. He\u2019ll do things like jump out from behind a corner and scream loudly in his face, lock eyes with him in a staring contest and then yell loudly to scare him or throw him up in the air which he hates. I can only assume his intention is to make him cry because that is always the outcome. We never leave a get together with Uncle G without him having made Baby J cry at least once. \n\nEvery time I see him do it I\u2019ll intervene, take Baby J away, and make a comment ranging from mild to moderate shaming. Something like \u2018Can you stop please?\u2019,  \u2018You\u2019re the only person he cries around.\u2019 Or  \u2018Gee. I don\u2019t think he likes that\u2019. We also limit our time around their family for this and other reasons. \n\nThe last time Uncle G scared him so bad that every time Baby J looked at him for the rest of the evening he broke down in tears. Uncle G\u2019s reasoning was \u2018Life is tough. I\u2019m teaching him he needs to be tough. That\u2019ll teach him to have a stare down with me.\u2019 \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do at this point. I already make comments when it happens and it hasn\u2019t changed his behavior. I asked my husband to say something and he just shrugs and says the natural consequence for Uncle G is that Baby J just won\u2019t like him.  Is that enough? AITA for calling him out on it and expecting my husband should say something or not?", "created_utc": 1694377738, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16far5l/aita_for_telling_off_my_bil_who_keeps/", "score": 2500, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Two girls and a boy. Our youngest is the boy, he\u2019s just over a year old. \nMy husbands brother, we\u2019ll call him Uncle G, is married with four girls 2-7yo. They have always wanted a boy and continue having babies in hopes they\u2019ll have a boy, so far no luck. \n\nEver since having our youngest son Uncle G has antagonized him every time we\u2019ve seen him which is roughly once a month since Baby J was about two months old. He\u2019ll do things like jump out from behind a corner and scream loudly in his face, lock eyes with him in a staring contest and then yell loudly to scare him or throw him up in the air which he hates. I can only assume his intention is to make him cry because that is always the outcome. We never leave a get together with Uncle G without him having made Baby J cry at least once. \n\nEvery time I see him do it I\u2019ll intervene, take Baby J away, and make a comment ranging from mild to moderate shaming. Something like \u2018Can you stop please?\u2019,  \u2018You\u2019re the only person he cries around.\u2019 Or  \u2018Gee. I don\u2019t think he likes that\u2019.

I once collapsed at a party on my parents' boat and when my dad's friend jumped up to help, the dog would not let him near me. He was an anxious dog his entire (sadly short) life.

I would try to get in with my siblings and cousins, but I could rarely tolerate the cold water. One time one of my uncle's was tired of me \"being a baby\". I was 5 or 6. He picked me up, spun around, and hurled me into the pool... where I hit a floating raft, got the wind knocked out of me, sank, and then struggled back to the surface. It was years before I went near that pool again. My uncle swears this never happened and he would never do that to \"one of his nieces\".
