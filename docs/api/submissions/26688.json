While she is married with 3 kids (3.5M, 2F, and a 6month old M). Her husband doesn\u2019t have a job and is the one tending to their kids. They had a food poisoning incident at home and all her kids needed to be rushed to the emergency as they kept vomiting, had fever. She then went to me to borrow money. That time, I lent her as I understood the urgency and it involved her kids\u2019 health. She paid it on her promised date which was great. \n\nAnd then the borrowing continued. She messaged me 2 weeks after the emergency that she now needs to borrow because what she had at the moment was not enough for daily needs until the payday. I told her that I do not have spare to give anymore due to my own expenses and other stuff (I have 5 cats and god knows how much money I had to spend during vet visit). But I offered to share my packed lunches if she liked, I could packed bigger portion for the two of us. She said she didn\u2019t want to. She was able to borrow from one of her college friends.\n\nAnd then just yesterday Angela messaged me, borrowing again. She said she\u2019s short on rent payment. I said I don\u2019t have extra to spare. She said she understood.\n\nEarlier, during lunch break, we sat on the same table and I was chatting with one of my friends about this kpop awards show and that I would be going to it with our other friend who\u2019s also a fan. Angela heard our conversation as she\u2019s on the same table, she said \u201cYou actually have money to spare\u201d I was confused and I asked her \u201chuh?\u201d She answered \u201cYou said you don\u2019t have extra money to let me borrow so my family can keep our place and be able to eat\u201d all our friends on the table were confused. Angela added, \u201cI am also a fan of Korean groups but I would never prioritize it over the human basic needs\u201d\n\nI got really upset and lashed out.  \u201cLook here, you chose to have many children to feed, and it\u2019s not my fault. I don\u2019t bear responsibility on your family. And this kpop concert ticket is a need for ME.\u201d \n\nShe called me an insensitive bitch and that I don\u2019t understand because I\u2019m not a mother.\n\nTo which I answered \u201cyour kids aren\u2019t my kids. I will be buying this kpop concert ticket whether you and your family get kicked out or run out of foods to eat. Your family is not my responsibility.\u201d\n\nShe walked out and cried. Our colleague who heard the conversation said I was kinda too much and that I could be more understanding with other people\u2019s situation.

Evenings and weekends only, too.\n\nNTA.  This woman's family are her dependents, not yours.", "I am confused. Why is his SAHD job not counting as a job?", "Have you tried finding a part time job that offers consistent scheduled hours lately? \n\nWhether it\u2019s FT or PT, my point is that your \u201csolution\u201d is a lot easier said than done.", "Thats not a US flag \ud83d\ude02.  The whole thing had another country vibe bc who would do that or assume that?", "Can't upvote this enough", "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes", "If you lend money to a friend or loved one, do so assuming it\u2019s a gift and you\u2019ll never get paid back. \ud83e\udee0", "Restaurants (at least in my experience here in the US) are notoriously bad about only requiring workers to work during their available hours.\n\nBut, sounds like he has some retail experience and, probably could do that on the weekends at least.", "It is, but they NEED another job. They can't relay on others giving them money. It might be very tough and shitty, but if they're risking losing their home and going hungry, the best advice is for them both to work more (husband getting a part time job, wife taking care of children when husband isn't home).", "Actually yes. I have had one for 4 years. My schedule is the same week after week, with very few exceptions such as covering for a call out or taking the odd day off. Several people I know have picked up similar PT jobs, including our HS age kiddo and her friends.", "I hope it\u2019s right flag for Philippines", "Isn't that the point of the ESH vote?", "Not from the US, so I didn't know that. How do college students make that work? Around here, working in restaurants or bars is a popular job for college students, cause they can combine it well with their studies. \n\nBut like you've said, there are other jobs available, which he could do part time when his wife is home.", "Totally respect that and you are right about this. But I felt a little resentful that OP and (at least at the time) most commenters seemed to be considering him as unemployed at best.", "Maybe but I don\u2019t get how op sucks when she\u2019s the victim in this story", "Oh, restaurants have MASSIVE turnover in the US. Do to that and a number of other issues.", "Former US food service veteran chiming in to say restaurants are definitely notorious for not following your given hours and before you know it you\u2019re at 30 hours a week due to \u201cstaffing issues.\u201d OP is NTA though.", "Pretty sure I addressed that. OP was asked a simple question. OP responded by flying off the handle and exploding on this person.", "Let\u2019s not act like the coworker didn\u2019t ask the question in a confrontational way", "I'm not. EVERYBODY sucks here. What is unclear about that?", "Nope imo only the coworker sucks because OP was just defending herself from a verbal attack"]}
