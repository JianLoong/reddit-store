While she is married with 3 kids (3.5M, 2F, and a 6month old M). Her husband doesn\u2019t have a job and is the one tending to their kids. They had a food poisoning incident at home and all her kids needed to be rushed to the emergency as they kept vomiting, had fever. She then went to me to borrow money. That time, I lent her as I understood the urgency and it involved her kids\u2019 health. She paid it on her promised date which was great. \n\nAnd then the borrowing continued. She messaged me 2 weeks after the emergency that she now needs to borrow because what she had at the moment was not enough for daily needs until the payday. I told her that I do not have spare to give anymore due to my own expenses and other stuff (I have 5 cats and god knows how much money I had to spend during vet visit). But I offered to share my packed lunches if she liked, I could packed bigger portion for the two of us. She said she didn\u2019t want to. She was able to borrow from one of her college friends.\n\nAnd then just yesterday Angela messaged me, borrowing again. She said she\u2019s short on rent payment. I said I don\u2019t have extra to spare. She said she understood.\n\nEarlier, during lunch break, we sat on the same table and I was chatting with one of my friends about this kpop awards show and that I would be going to it with our other friend who\u2019s also a fan. Angela heard our conversation as she\u2019s on the same table, she said \u201cYou actually have money to spare\u201d I was confused and I asked her \u201chuh?\u201d She answered \u201cYou said you don\u2019t have extra money to let me borrow so my family can keep our place and be able to eat\u201d all our friends on the table were confused. Angela added, \u201cI am also a fan of Korean groups but I would never prioritize it over the human basic needs\u201d\n\nI got really upset and lashed out.  \u201cLook here, you chose to have many children to feed, and it\u2019s not my fault. I don\u2019t bear responsibility on your family. And this kpop concert ticket is a need for ME.\u201d \n\nShe called me an insensitive bitch and that I don\u2019t understand because I\u2019m not a mother.\n\nTo which I answered \u201cyour kids aren\u2019t my kids. I will be buying this kpop concert ticket whether you and your family get kicked out or run out of foods to eat. Your family is not my responsibility.\u201d\n\nShe walked out and cried. Our colleague who heard the conversation said I was kinda too much and that I could be more understanding with other people\u2019s situation.

But she tried to shame you in front of your colleagues. \n\nNTA", "Give them an inch and they think they're a ruler!", "Aside from asking a co-worker if they had 4 quarter for a dollar, or the odd dime, I've never asked for money at work.", "This person reminds me of my middle sibling who thinks the family should be sending them money every month to cover their expenses. This, despite the fact I make little more than they receive for disability income, and they live in a rent controlled housing and receive a discounted multi-zone bus pass. Other people aren't responsible for making sure this woman has enough to cover expenses. If they need more money than her income covers, either her husband should get a job, or she picks up a second, part-time job.", "she said her husband used to own a little shop selling basketball jerseys, but got bankrupt because his friend who\u2019s also co-owner ran with the money and never came back. Her husband also tried buying and selling e-cigs (vapes) but it never worked.", "But then the kids would need to go to daycare, which for three kids would be ludicrously expensive. He\u2019d need to make like $50K/year at minimum just to break even.", "Because they have 3.5, 2, and a 6 months old baby", "After thinking about what happened over and over again, I feel that I was indeed harsh with what I said about her family. My mother told me I could be nicer and choose nicer words but that she also understands how I got really upset. I told my best friend about this and said I plan to apologize for my hash words, my best friend said that if I do that, I better expect another \u201clet me borrow money\u201d text from Angela next week if we ever made up.", "Im wondering that and does this really happen?", "She was definitely hoping to make OP look bad so she\u2019d give in a loan the money. But given her track record, it would be a never ending cycle of her asking for loans", "Vapes are coming under stricter policies every day. So him failing at entering in the vape resale market is no shock. Nope, dude just needs to pull himself up and find a PT job. Hell, even the Amazon warehouse by us is hiring. All shifts, all positions and at a fairly decent wage. Better than finding themselves on the streets.", "Full time daycare for a part time job? Why can't he work when his wife isn't? Millions of people do. Why not him? I've known a lot of folks who picked up PT jobs to help out with the bills or for other reasons. Even drawing 15-20 hours a week in wages is better than nothing, especially if it means the difference between having a roof over their heads or not.", "She's right though, she'll think you apologising is taking back what you said. And that itll turn round being 'the least you could do' \nLeave it as it is, you don't talk anyway so your not missing much.", "NTA, she's like a shark, the second she smells blood, she'll pounce. You apologising would be that metaphorical blood in the water. You are not obliged to provide for her kids.", "I wouldn't be surprised if she weaponizes your apology to make you look bad at work.  Sounds like you don't necessarily need to have a relationship at work with her so there's no benefit to apologizing.", "No. You are not her bank, how is this normal?  Is this a cultural thing where you are supposed to fund your coworkers?  Im aware of this in the US", "We don\u2019t know that your colleague will be in the same page as you with that apology, OP. You say harsh, but she inserted herself into your personal finances that you actually don\u2019t need to justify to anyone (with exceptions of course, but that doesn\u2019t apply to your situation) how you\u2019re spending your money. \n\nAnyone who tells you you\u2019re too harsh, just say \u201cGreat. I\u2019ll send her your way for loans, sounds like you\u2019re able and willing to help her.\u201d If they say she asked you for help, not them, just repeat that again. Hold a figurative mirror up to their faces and see how they react.", "I think you can pair your apology with \"Given how this situation at work played out, I'm not going to be able to loan you any money in the future. Given that we work on the same team/in the same area, it creates a conflict of interest that can negatively impact our working relationship.\"\n\nThis is something you should talk to your manager about, too. If Angela tries to make things difficult at work, you want your manager to know this background. Your manager may also give you some guidelines around friends working at different levels that can help you shut down any future requests from Angela.", "There\u2019s that. Gods, I\u2019m especially triggered as I gave into a friend as well. That\u2019s money I\u2019m never seeing back.", "This. He could get a pt job at a restaurant or some other place where he can work in the evenings and on the weekend. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, NTA. I really hate if people chose to have many kids and then expect other people to pay for their choices."]}
