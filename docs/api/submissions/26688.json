While she is married with 3 kids (3.5M, 2F, and a 6month old M). Her husband doesn\u2019t have a job and is the one tending to their kids. They had a food poisoning incident at home and all her kids needed to be rushed to the emergency as they kept vomiting, had fever. She then went to me to borrow money. That time, I lent her as I understood the urgency and it involved her kids\u2019 health. She paid it on her promised date which was great. \n\nAnd then the borrowing continued. She messaged me 2 weeks after the emergency that she now needs to borrow because what she had at the moment was not enough for daily needs until the payday. I told her that I do not have spare to give anymore due to my own expenses and other stuff (I have 5 cats and god knows how much money I had to spend during vet visit). But I offered to share my packed lunches if she liked, I could packed bigger portion for the two of us. She said she didn\u2019t want to. She was able to borrow from one of her college friends.\n\nAnd then just yesterday Angela messaged me, borrowing again. She said she\u2019s short on rent payment. I said I don\u2019t have extra to spare. She said she understood.\n\nEarlier, during lunch break, we sat on the same table and I was chatting with one of my friends about this kpop awards show and that I would be going to it with our other friend who\u2019s also a fan. Angela heard our conversation as she\u2019s on the same table, she said \u201cYou actually have money to spare\u201d I was confused and I asked her \u201chuh?\u201d She answered \u201cYou said you don\u2019t have extra money to let me borrow so my family can keep our place and be able to eat\u201d all our friends on the table were confused. Angela added, \u201cI am also a fan of Korean groups but I would never prioritize it over the human basic needs\u201d\n\nI got really upset and lashed out.  \u201cLook here, you chose to have many children to feed, and it\u2019s not my fault. I don\u2019t bear responsibility on your family. And this kpop concert ticket is a need for ME.\u201d \n\nShe called me an insensitive bitch and that I don\u2019t understand because I\u2019m not a mother.\n\nTo which I answered \u201cyour kids aren\u2019t my kids. I will be buying this kpop concert ticket whether you and your family get kicked out or run out of foods to eat. Your family is not my responsibility.\u201d\n\nShe walked out and cried.

Got a desperate call they needed it for baby meds, I said ok but I have to have the money back by certain date to get partners meds. Surprise - never got it back, was told sorry used it to pay rent so you have to wait. They had the cheek to ask for more money a week later. I said no you still owe from last time.  Called me an AS and blocked me on everything.", "NTA- I am always amazed at the people who feel that they are somehow so entitled that other people need to take care of them. You called it right. Her kids are not your kids. Deadbeat dad should get off his duff and get a job. They could work different shifts to avoid paying for childcare. Buy them a box of condoms.", "NTA but there's a reason my workplace has a no business transactions between colleagues policy; no buying, selling, borrowing, loaning with the exception of up to $20 for lunch if someone forgets wallet or whatever. And that's not to be a recurring thing, more of an emergency basis.\n\nStop loaning money to this woman. She sees that with a promotion you have more money and feels entitled to it.", "NTA, it's totally inappropriate that a colleague is even asking you for money, sadly you were nice enough to say yes once and now she's trying to take advantage with her emotional manipulation tactics. You're right, she chose to have all those kids knowing her finances are tight, her and her husband are responsible for them, not you", "NTA. She sees you as her personal ATM. She needs to fix her own problems.", "NTA\n\nI bet she won't bother you anymore! She will probably spread stuff around the office about you, but anyway.... sorted\n\nI've been in a pinch a few times and borrowed money, but ultimately my main goals was to not have to borrow money anymore! So I didn't make my problems their problems. If I asked and they refused, I could only go like \"Ok, no prob, totally understand!\".\n\nShe and her husband made certain life choices and they are the ones who will have to adjust something in their lives so they're not struggling! \n\nShe defo shouldn't be slamming you just because you choose how to spend **your** money, that she's **not** entitled to\n\nNTA", "Eh, I think this is an ESH situation, although much more on Angela's side than yours. Her behavior at the lunch room was completely inappropriate (and even her initial requests were pretty dodgy), but your response to her was unnecessarily rude. There were much more tactful ways to shut her down. Just to emphasize, it was the nature of your response that elevates this to ESH, not the fact that you declined her request to loan her money.", "NTA, she didn\u2019t inform you that her and her family were part of your budget.", "NTA  , but since this happened at work and another coworker complained about it I do wonder if you should bring this up to HR or at least document it in an email to yourself in case she tries to (wrongly so) bring it up to HR to get you in trouble (which is laughable. But she could try and get the other person to come forward as a witness when they only heard the part about you saying her kids were not important to you) and get revenge for not loaning her money. You could just go to HR and say a recent conversation with a coworker has left you uncomfortable and you don\u2019t know how to proceed. You would know your companies hr department and their culture more than me.", "NTA - it\u2019s not your fault that your colleague\u2019s husband is unemployed or that she doesn\u2019t know how birth control works.", "NTA.\nEverything you said is 100% true. If we all pared down our lives to suit someone else's needs, there pretty much won't be any joy left, as there's always someone worse off than us.\nYou work hard, you choose your needs and wants. Your colleague's needs don't play into yours.", "OP make sure to tell that colleague how we many times she has tried to borrow money from you, and you are tired of her trying to guilt you about her having kids she chose to have.", "NTA.  Your co-worker\u2019s entitlement is utterly ridiculous & honestly baffling to me.  I could never imagine asking a colleague for money or having the audacity to dictate what they spend THEIR money on.  Insane.", "She loaned to her once, declined to loan again the next two times she asked..doesn't she have any other relatives or friends? She thinks she can ask her repeatedly like she's a bank? No no no..", "I gotta tell you, I am at the end of my rope with entitled parents these days.", ">I don't understand why your first instinct was to lash out at her so publicly.\n\nshe was defending herself after Angela attempted to publicly shame her and act as though OP going to a concert would directly result in causing her children to lose the roof over their heads. I wouldn't say it was without warning.. OP was tactless for sure, but she was basically baited into it.", "\"Your lack of planning does not constitute a guilt trip on my part\" should have been your response. Seriously, I'd be like, bro, I feel like you had *some* say for being in the situation you currently find yourself in", "For real....\n\nWas he hoping that after too many \"must be nice\" you'd be like \"You know what? My bad, here's half of my salary, you need it more!\" ?\n\nSome people, damn", "Mebbe time for husband to look for a proper job. Part time still helps!\n\nInstead of trying to be his own boss, time to have a boss", "Is it really too much to expect an adult to not be baited into screaming at someone? Perhaps my expectations are too high lol", "OP could be a millionaire and still choose not to give them money! Some people are way too entitled!\n\nThat colleague reminds me of my parents: they had 3 of us and apparently from my older brother they were already struggling financially! Why have two more, bloody idiots! \n\nPeople need to understand that kids are a money sinkhole! I have just the one and by jove, nursery is a second rent... But hey, partner and I were ready to do this, we talked and planned for it\n\nCan't understand people just popping out kids without checking their finances", "Both my parents worked full time when I was born. My mom is a nurse and she worked the evening shift so she'd take care of my older sister and I during the day until my dad returned from work, then she'd go to work and my dad would take care of us in the evenings and in the mornings until my mom woke up and he had to go to work. It worked for them and it saved a lot on childcare costs.", "I didn't read the part where it said OP was screaming or yelling, to me lashing out could mean that she just lost her patience and responded in an irritated \"not taking any bs\" tone. This girl tried to make it seem in front of a table full of colleagues that if her family doesn't have a place to live it's directly OP's fault. Again, OP was tactless but her response wasn't completely unwarranted.", "Or continuing to borrow from people repeatedly", "The \"lashed out\" part is what makes me think they went a bit over the line"]}
