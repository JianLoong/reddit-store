Discrimination against women can be seen in a variety of different industries, especially ones dominated by men. \n\nTo put it into perspective, I don\u2019t know any women in my field who *haven\u2019t* experienced it. It comes up naturally in our conversations because of how bloody frequent it is.\n\nWe should call it out where we see it. We shouldn\u2019t act like it\u2019s fine because of someone\u2019s background and opportunities. \n\nDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s really weird that you felt the need to challenge her over this, but then describe her response as being \u201creally pissy\u201d? How the hell do you expect someone to respond to such a ridiculous challenge?", "She has wealth privilege, she does not have male privilege.", "NTA, not even close", "Nta, yup she's not a victim", "NTA. Your sister sounds like the kind of person who will latch onto anything to claim victimhood. Class will always be the biggest barrier to entry, but in today's world you can be filthy rich and have doors opened for you that nobody else has, but as long as you belong to some minority you can claim that you had to work harder and struggled more.\n\nIt's embarrassing and pathetic, but here we are, living in a time when victimhood is currency. Unfortunately, places like reddit foster that mentality, so you won't get a lot of understanding here.", "YTA\n\nWhile she might have had more help rising to where she is, she can still see the failures of the industry and use her plattform to lift the struggles that those less fortunate have to endure. And while she has had more help on the way up than the average person, it doesnt mean that she hasnt also been barred from opportunities she would have been the best choise for, but didnt get because she was a woman. Sexism in entertainemnt is too wildly known for you to be this braisen in your rejection of the idea of it.", "Yta. Jesus Christ. Have some self awareness", "YTA yet very good at mansplaining.", "YTA - Your sister sounds like she's well aware of how privileged and fortunate she's been in her career, just as she's aware of how different it might have been without those family connections. She sees her less fortunate peers struggling and witnesses the inequalities first hand. She sounds like a much nicer person than you, with a good heart and empathy.\n\nYou don't have to have directly suffered yourself in order to feel the pain of others.", "YTA because you are not the object of the discriminatory behavior she is talking about.\n\nIn particular, you cannot take a very specific episode (your friend's case) to argue against a broader reasoning.", "Her privilege doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t experience discrimination. It may be mitigated by advantages that other women in the same industry do not have, but she still can experience discrimination as a woman in the music industry. \n\nYTA", "NTA, you only spoke facts", "YTA. I don\u2019t know how your sister\u2019s post went exactly, but it sounds like she talked of discrimination against women in general, and not only her, so her privilege is really not the subject. I think her post would have been even more impactful if she checked her privilege (again, maybe she did, you didn\u2019t really expand on that), something in the line of \u00ab\u00a0even though I can count myself as privileged because my family gave me a lot of access I could not have without them, I still had to face X, which in my experience is mainly faced by women in the industry. I can\u2019t even imagine how hard it is for women who don\u2019t have the same privilege I benefited from.\u00a0\u00bb but she is under no obligation to do it. I just think it would have made the message even stronger.", "YtA.\n\nYou ever talk to a rich black person? They have a much higher level of privilege than a poor black person, but you bet your ass that they still experience racism.\n\nYour sister may have a lot of privilege breaking into this industry, she has opportunities that someone else does not. Doesn't mean she hasn't experienced gender based discrimination in her industry. Every woman has no matter how rich or how many connections she has.\n\nIncidentally, \"You're only ahead cause of your connections.\" Is absolutely another form of gender based discrimination. You ever heard of a male artist being disparaged for getting his start through family in the industry? Nope. You've just invalidated her entire experience as a woman cause she got a leg up in her career.", "She spelled 'nepotism baby' wrong.

Even if she has it easier that other women bc of your mother connections, it does not mean she has it as easy as if she was a man.\n\nIdk your sister and her experience, but you don't either. And she's not even talking about her only, but about female dj in general.", "I can name a famous female DJ: Paris Hilton. I can\u2019t say for sure, but I think if she made a post about how she\u2019d been discriminated against for being female in the DJ industry, people might roll their eyes a bit, because any discrimination she faced was likely more than offset by her celebrity status and familial connections. I think that\u2019s what OP is getting at.", "Not saying she hasn\u2019t experienced sexism, I gave her an example of one of her peers who and I know well personally whose worked years to get to the position that my sister was practically provided on a silver platter.", "While I understand some of the points people make calling me TA, women in any field  can and will experience challenges unique to them in certain if not most fields of work.\n\nBut you sum up my sister perfectly, entitled, spoiled and she doesn\u2019t even realise it, and yeah probably the wrong place to air this sentiment because redditors will usually side with \u2018le woman\u2019 for internet points, but I don\u2019t really care about whether or not I get up or down doots", "But even if she isn\u2019t, she\u2019s still claiming she is, not standing up for others, she was born with a silver spoon in her mouth and was given many opportunities that a lot of people in the music industry don\u2019t get, men or women.", "Agreed.

Bring everyone up with you, not force everyone down.", "Amazing - almost every industry must just have more males aspiring to it. I\u2019m sure women just disproportionately aspire to roles where they have to clean up literal shit or take care of kids.\n\nProblem solved!", "Because all women aspire to work in service industries.

Generally with equal opportunity, men and women take different pathways but there is absolutely nothing stopping women from doing a traditionally \u2018male\u2019 dominated role.\n\nAre there no female singers?
