You can be privileged in some ways and still discriminated against in others. She didn't say she's had it harder than anyone in the world, she said she's experience gender-based discrimination, which any woman in a male-dominated industry almost certainly has. Stop being a jerk.", "How cute, two nepo babies fighting in their natural habitat.", "YTA - so because she\u2019s been fortunate to have one kind of privilege, she hasn\u2019t been discriminated against in another way? I\u2019m a white straight woman, should I quit complaining about how I\u2019m discriminated against in my career and opportunities, because I\u2019ve not experienced homophobia or racism? Or should I keep talking about those experiences that I or other women may come across to try and make it better for all women?", "I'll go with YTA. You don't have to be the privilege police.", "YTA\n\nShe's not just talking about her experience there, but about all women djs. Which she probably knows more of than you, has spoken to more female djs than you, and has a better understanding of what female djs go thru in the business.\n\nYes, she has privileges others don't, but that doesn't negate what women in general will have to go thru. You should listen and learn more, you've got privilege to check as well.", "YTA. It doesn't matter whether she's been victimized or not--you're an AH just for being the victim police. I keep reading through your post looking for ANYTHING that would give you authority to decide how people are allowed to feel or what they're allowed to post about online and the only thing I've found is your massive ego.", "YTA \n\nJust because she's kind of a nepotism baby doesn't mean she still hasn't had to deal with shit because she's a young woman in a male dominated industry. Privilege doesn't always mean you don't have problems, it just means you don't have as many as other people. \n\nAlso she wasn't just talking about herself, she was talking about the industry itself as a whole. Can you even name a well known female dj? Hell can you even name a female dj who isn't your sister? Whens the last time you saw a female dj headlining an event? Having their own regular night at a major bar? Album drop?", "YTA. Women in the music industry are paid less and given far less opportunity than men and that is a fact. For you to diss your sister from your position of male privilege is just beyond the pale!", "There's such thing as intersectionality. yta", "YTA. Speaking as a female employed as a DJ, it is definitely more challenging. When I went to audio engineering school, there was like 3 women in the entire school vs. 100+ men. Her connections certainly helped but it doesn\u2019t erase the fact there is a bias, especially depending on what type of DJ gig she does.", "If she was a man with the same family, connections, privilege, etc, she feels she would\u2019ve been treated differently. That\u2019s how gender-based discrimination works. YTA, apologize sincerely and ask her if she\u2019d be willing to help you learn more about discrimination in her field.", "YTA You\u2019re not a DJ and you haven\u2019t lived her life. You don\u2019t know the dynamics of her industry or how she\u2019s experienced it. She\u2019s allowed to have her own thoughts and opinions about what she\u2019s experienced in her own life. \n\nAlso, even if she has experienced privilege it doesn\u2019t mean that she can\u2019t see how it generally plays out for women in her industry and be very aware that she only got opportunities as a result of contacts. It\u2019s great to have got the job/s, but she could be unsettled about how easy it is to be looked over. \n\nWhy not just ask her about her opinions and learn about her perspectives rather than telling her about how she  doesn\u2019t know about her own life.", "YTA. specific examples of privileges don\u2019t cancel out industry wide bigotry and prejudice.", "YTA - not because you're wrong about what you wrote.  your sister could even be said to be \"privileged\" and had a much easier path then someone without connections.  \n\nhowever, she was talking about being a victim of losing jobs due to being a woman in her field.  are you a DJ?  have you tried to get a job as a female DJ?  how do you know she's NEVER lost a gig to a guy because she's a girl.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't like the victim mentality of today's kids at all.  I think there is something fundamentally weak and setting yourself up for failure by thinking your a victim.  I don't think it's laudible or even praiseworthy to be a victim.  I don't think it's something you run to instagram to brag about either.  So I get why you might want to slap your sister down for her POV on this issue because by every definition she's very very privileged.  \n\nBut despite all of this you're still TA.  for all you know she just lost out on a big gig to some dude who can't do it at all, because the dangly bits between his legs, and she was venting on IG about how much this sucks.  And instead of support from her bro, she gets told she is privilege and has no right to talk about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsee why YTA?", "NTA. \n\nAs someone who has worked with many DJ\u2019s, they do tend to be male. But each of them have spent years upon years to get where they are. \n\nYour sister might be a fantastic DJ but there\u2019s thousands of them out there and they might just be better than she is", "YTA. Just because you have some privileges doesn't mean you aren't disadvantaged in other ways. Sexism is real. She is luckier than most women by the sounds of things, but a man in her position would still likely be better off.", "Mostly NTA as she sounds incredibly entitled and doesn't realise how good she has it but I can see how it would be upsetting from the perspective that you're trying to invalidate her experiences of sexism as a woman when you're a man (which comes across as a bit ignorant). \n\nShe might be exaggerating how much it's affecting her and I don't disagree with pointing out that she is actually quite privileged but I wouldn't just jump to the conclusion she's not experienced any sexism in the music industry and say she's \"not a victim (of sexism) in the slightest\" just because she's got connections and is from a wealthy family. So stepping into YTA territory in that regard.", "NTA - You spoke your truth & you both know there are countless examples to debunk her statement. If she has different views not stated about 'missed opportunities' it is up to her to explain/elaborate.", "NTA. You have an excellent argument", "YTA. Two reasons:\n\n1) Why did you feel the need to laugh and argue with her about it?\n\n2) None of your arguments actually disprove what she said. She said she is a victim of being a woman in a male dominated industry. \n\nEven privileged people are disadvantaged in their lives, and not only did you try to diminish your sister\u2019s life, you failed. Now you\u2019ve got an angry sister, is that what you wanted? Was being right (when you weren\u2019t) that important?", "NTA, I'm sure she thinks she has struggled being a woman but she started out with her foot firmly in the door.", "As someone with no family in the industry who couldn\u2019t get my band a decent gig in years, NTA haha I\u2019d love to be in that situation.", "NTA. \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06", "NTA she might very well experienced some discrimination but if she has never the less enjoyed \"easy\" success you have the god given sibling right to mock her self-labeling as the victim of the patriarchy.", "NTA - your sister needs to accept that she\u2019s a nepo baby", "NTA those who love us the most keep it reel with us", "Well it could all be fake for all we know, so no, I don't know her life. And yes, maybe I appear insensitive but I'm sorry, no, I reserve my sympathy for the women she/people in her position took away opportunities from because they lacked connections.", "NTA.

Privileges and disadvantages can stack - you're not limited to just one.\n\nAlso, have you ever been a female DJ?  She has.  Maybe she's got more experience there than you.", "Being a man is the main privilege check you need. Even the most privileged woman has less privilege than a privileged man. You and your sister probably got the same stuff from your parents and upbringing but that doesn't mean your experiences in life and work are the same and that's because you are a man. It's not a bad thing as long as you start to and continue to see the differences and start to change the way you think.", "But not all women DJs have her privilege and struggle.  And she knows that.  YTA", "No, he's very much the AH for telling a woman that she hasn't experienced gender based discrimination that she says she has because *he* hasn't faced it because they're nepo babies. Sure, she has a huge advantage that others don't get, she can still face discrimination though.", ">Even the most privileged woman has less privilege than a privileged man\n\nThis seems to be contestable.", "The way I (female btw) see it is that discriminations do exist in a universe parallel to the universe where privileged nepo babies rarely denied opportunities - or at the very least given more opportunities regardless of their actual value. So trying to \"claim the unfair opportunities for women\", sorry no, cry me a river. I will stand by women actually facing injustice, not those who might have lost one opportunity due to gender but gained ten more due to name/connections etc.", "So you, not knowing OP's sister at all, also known her every circumstance and that she hasn't been discriminated against??? What are the lotto numbers please? I really could use your all knowing powers for a bit of a financial bump.\n\nOr... you could be a decent human (female or otherwise btw) and understand that even with having the \"right\" name in whatever field doesn't mean you don't face discrimination and that discrimination based on your genitalia *is wrong*. That in some fields, even a few missed opportunities can be life changing... which sucks even if you had other opportunities simply based on your family.", "So you're a woman that stands by other women but only other women you feel deserve it even when they all face the same discrimination? Fighting gender discrimination but ignoring people with other privileges is ridiculous. Do you also not stand by women who are white cause they have more access to opportunities?"]}
