Today was my birthday and my sister bought me a vanilla strawberry birthday cake. Keep in mind this is HER favorite birthday cake flavor and I don\u2019t like it one bit!!! This is an important detail for later. \nToday the day ended with me taking the birthday cake my sister bought me and literally tossing it in the trash. None of my family members are talking to me now and they are calling me an AH. Let me explain. My sister bought herself this cake essentially. She bought a strawberry vanilla cake knowing I hate it to get out of buying me an actually gift and to eat most of it herself, as she usually does. She does this all the time; she buys family members gifts they don\u2019t like and they end up giving it to her and she ends up using it or eating it. Anyway, that isn\u2019t why I tossed the cake. My sister has a habit of walking around without pants and sometimes without underwear. I tell her all the time that nobody wants to constantly see her bottom. She also scratches it and proceeds to touch food all the time. It\u2019s actually really gross and sometimes it smells BAD. My parents refuse to say anything unless I complain constantly and then they blame me for being dramatic and trying to start drama. I think it\u2019s disgusting tbh. She\u2019s a grown woman. Anyway, she decided to scratch her ass and stick her fingers in my cake and start eating the cream. I watched her and got so mad and disgusted that I took the cake and threw it out after because honestly she didn\u2019t deserve to enjoy any of it. \n\n\nAnd another note: she does this all the time with food so I won\u2019t eat any of it. She\u2019ll either lick it, spit on it, or put her gross hands into my food so she can eat it instead\n\n\nAITA?\nEdit: My parents are acting like the reason I threw it out was because I didn\u2019t like the cake flavor. However, that wasn\u2019t the case at all but that is why she keeps sticking her fingers in it. They keep saying that I need to stop starting drama. I personally still think that any normal person would find this gross. My parents claim that I\u2019m being a germaphobe and it\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nEdit #2: lots of the comments think this is a shit post which is kind of funny lol because it shows how absolutely insane the situation is so thank you. My family is filled with mentally unstable individuals with no respect or boundaries and I\u2019ve been working on getting out. I just can\u2019t tell anymore when I\u2019m being gaslit so I need clarification. Thanks for the responses\n\nEdit #3: comments have indicated that I should include the fact that I have OCD. I do and it\u2019s constantly used against me since they claim I\u2019m a germaphobe and \u201ccrazy\u201d. I would say I am on the neater and cleaner side, but regardless this is disgusting behavior on my siblings part. She\u2019s also aware I have ocd and she does things like this because she thinks it\u2019s \u201cfunny when I get worried\u201d because I am \u201ca weak loser.\u201d\n\nOk no more edits", "created_utc": 1686087306, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142u0pu/aita_for_throwing_out_the_birthday_cake_my_sister/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
