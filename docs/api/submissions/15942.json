So your wife sucks for not having your back and avoiding this entire situation by talking to her sister.  \n\nYou also could have talked to the sister, told her it makes you uncomfortable, and asked her to stop.  But you didn't.  Instead, you chose to engage in the same behavior your SIL was doing, despite knowing how much that behavior sucks.  So now you suck too.  That's what happens when you stoop to someone's sucky level.\n\nSIL sucks because who tf makes jokes about their BIL's downstairs decapod?  Not only is it body shaming, but it's just yuck.", "ESH.

If you aren't being taken seriously, then don't talk to the sister period. That would be my advice in the future. But nonetheless, you had a emotional response that was somewhat warranted, and I'm not going to fault you too much for that.\n\nAt the end of the day, everyone here ought to apologize to each other.

There's a big difference in your nicknames. Your's is adapted from a situation.
