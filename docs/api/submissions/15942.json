In my mind, \u201cthat\u2019s different\u201d translates to \u201cActually, these situations are the same, but I\u2019m saying that they\u2019re different because saying that they\u2019re the same would mean that I have to swallow my pride and admit that I was wrong.\u201d", "NTA.\n\nI thought you could be off the title. I certainly leaned towards it when I saw the nickname for the sister and the reason. But, it didn\u2019t take long to change my vote.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why, but women (I am one) seem to get less flak for making fun of men than when men make fun of women. Men are seen to have a thick skin and women are seen to be sensitive. Some people are like that, but not all. She bullied you about your junk, something you could be extremely insecure about (you don\u2019t seem to be, but another man in your position could be), and that\u2019s just wrong. The nickname your sister gave her sister is distasteful, but Yknow, they\u2019re sisters so whatever. Your nickname itself isn\u2019t distasteful, so her calling you shrimp/shrimpy would be acceptable, BUT only if she didn\u2019t make fun of your junk in the process. So, on that regard, I do believe it\u2019s fair game for her to be using your nickname but not you using hers. Which, is great, since you don\u2019t, and you seem to respect those boundaries. Good on you.\n\nI do gotta ask though, why not confront the sister about it? You seem to have implied you only talked to your wife about it and not her sister. No, she shouldn\u2019t be mocking you as that\u2019s wrong, but perhaps she doesn\u2019t know (even though she should) that it\u2019s hurting you. Maybe she thinks, since you didn\u2019t say anything the first time, you didn\u2019t mind. Some guys don\u2019t because they\u2019re very secure about their size and don\u2019t care (on the outside) so maybe she thought it just didn\u2019t bother you? If you didn\u2019t talk to her directly, I would\u2019ve before jumping to use her nickname simply because it\u2019s tied directly to the reason (yours is actual shrimp, implied for a small penis. Hers is just tits, implied for big tits so no mistaking the meaning of the nickname).\n\nBut, regardless, you\u2019re NTA and I\u2019d have a deep conversation with your wife about how much it bothers you. Sit her down, be direct, and tell her you\u2019re serious and it\u2019s making you very upset. No joking around, just a real conversation. If she downplays it or deflects, continue to hone in on your point.
