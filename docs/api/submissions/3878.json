It may have been your hubby trying to lighten the mood, but clearly you weren't ready for it.  \n\nMight be time for a sit down with thr family to discuss what is expected of everyone.

My husband\u2019s love language is definitely more physical, while mine is more verbal. While I do try to make sure I show plenty physical affection so he feels loved, he also understands that there are times that\u2019s overwhelming to me. He also likes to do silly things like it sounds like your husband does as well, but he knows if I tell him to stop it just means I am not in the mood right now. Body autonomy has to be respected in a relationship without hurt feelings. I would say that after things cool down a bit, it\u2019s a conversation that needs to come up again so that point is understood. I hope you heal well and that everything works out well for you!", "That may not work how you intend it to. That dick pinch may be the thing that calms him down and turns him on. I'm just giving you a male point of view, that's all.\n\nI like your humor though", "Because it is the one special thing we all look forward to all week. The kids call it their \"special treat\" since I go all out. It's like being able to go out to eat. I try and do things for them at home. I am the youngest of 9 and my kids get to hear about their cousin going to gymnastics, or another going out 4 nights a week for dinner, going on shopping trips and vacations. I guess I feel bad because we can't afford to do anything aside from going camping a couple of times durring the summer. This is something I can do for them. Ease my \"mom guilt\".", "Why?

Note the word pinch. Not cup not stroke. To pinch is to take a thin Piece of skin and squeeze it with force that causes pain. unless they had a pain fetish. Which is a thing I suppose.", "Oh my I\u2019m so sorry.  I missed that was just on Saturday.  I thought you did this every morning and I was like dang that\u2019s a lot of work!  That is a very sweet tradition.  Please take my apologies.", "Do you ever run up to him and hurt him for lolz? Maybe pinch his balls when he\u2019s in a bad mood?  \n\nYou weren\u2019t \u201cdisplacing your anger\u201d you just didn\u2019t want to be touched in an unkind way.", "If I had been in your shoes and I met the kitchen in such a state I would've turned right around and headed back to bed.

You were totally fine\n\nNTA", "Seems like you were just overwhelmed, and definitely not the time for grabby attempts at intimacy, especially if you were also physically recovering.", "You're not wrong, he should have taken care of cleaning and cooking instead of leaving it all on you after surgery. The least he could have done was made sure the kitchen was clean. If anything, you're underreacting.", "Lol its totally fine \ud83d\ude42 and I could not do that everyday! Way to much work!!", "NTA\n\nEven when you're married, you still have the right to bodily autonomy.  (At least, I *think* we still have that right.  Have to check with the Supreme Court to be sure.)  No one gets to touch you without consent.\n\nIf you're in a bad mood, you're not in the mood to be intimate.  That doesn't make you an AH.  That makes you human - ie, NOT a sex doll.\n\n>Now, apparently, I'm a witch with a B.\n\nDid your husband call you that just because you said no to him?  Gross.  He needs to learn how to deal with disappointment, and he DEFINITELY needs to learn that it's not okay to call people cruel names just because he was denied something he wanted.", "NTA.\nHusband is a jerk", "Tell him to get used to it.  Its a common development that has uncanny duration.", "NTA so basically your husband left the kitchen a shit tip...did not bother to make sure the kids have loaded the dishwasher...and thinks its OK to grab your boobies when you are recovering from surgery... had to clean the kitchen and cook the breakfast!!\n\nNot the smartest is he!!", "NTA\n\nAre we twins?!?! What you just wrote I could have wrote myself - right down to the first two kids ages, the boob grabing and going out for a smoke. \n\nI too am usually very calm and level. I give my kids the occasional 'excuse me' with 'the look' and that's usually what it takes. \n\nBut there is the odd time that I. Lose. My. Shit!! No, I don't want to be touched. No, I don't want to be talked to. No, I don't even want to be thought of!!!\n\nJust give me 10mins COMPLETELY in silence!!\n\nAgain - NTA", "Nta but you shouldn't complain about being broke when you chose to have three kids and smoke.", "NTA.

You did something they prob didnt care for but you really had to. Suddenly your tired and hurting not lets forget the aid you should have used but you didnt just so we remember your surgery so we feel for you and your story.\n\nYou want to go back to work, you wanted make brek so you feel good enough for all this so in essence  you have told your hubbie yeah im all good i can do all this but suddenly he thinks your ok and trys a bit of fun and your all, omg my surgery, im in pain tired.\n\nEither you are or your not. You want to work, do ya brek, you good enough to do that, if you dont want ya hubbie to touch you just say that.", "NTA. No one has a right to touch you if you don't want them to, not even your husband", "NTA. He is shitty for making you feel bad for expressing autonomy over your own body.", "NTA\n\nYour husband sounds like he has no situational awareness. swearing at your children sucks tho.", "NAH", "NTA! You\u2019re better than me I would have smacked his hand if he went to grab on me especially after surgery.", "NTA - this is a situation where people need to learn to \u201cread the room\u201d.  You were obviously already upset after having recently yelled at your kids, and you went outside for a breather. So why did dear husband think this was an appropriate time to pinch you?  Instead of calling you a witch with a B how about trying a simple apology - I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t realize you were still upset and still in pain.  I\u2019m sure he was trying to lighten the mood but he needs to understand that sometimes you need to let someone have their moment of frustration or anger and wait until it passes. Better yet, ask what he could do to help make it better instead. You have a right to your own feelings. I hope you feel better soon.", "You are correct and I knew that was going to be brought up at least once. No ill will towards you. Just letting you know that you are correct.", "I've never smoked in my life and even I know that is a ridiculous thing to say and judge on. You try quitting an addictive drug cold turkey, see how it goes, yeah?", "Nope, the OP has the right to decide how much she can handle after major surgery, and what activities she wants to spend that limited energy on. The fact that she has just enough energy to cook breakfast for her family does not in any way imply that she  also has the energy (or inclination) for sex. What an AH thing to assume!", "If your husband was in a bad mood I'm sure he'd tell you don't if you ran up to him to pinch his boobs. NTA", "IDK. If he was trying to make you feel better, pinching your breasts wasn\u2019t really the best way to go IMO.", "Right now, the whole rest of your family should be feeling guilt for not taking better care of you. You need time and rest to get better. You definitely should not be up doing major cooking while still in pain! I\u2019m a baker and doing a good job on biscuits uses core muscles that you absolutely should be resting. Yikes.\n\nWhen I was in elementary school and my mom had to have surgery, my dad and grandmother made darn sure we kids understood that she loved us but couldn\u2019t do all the usual things right then. They made clear that she would need time and help, and showed us things we could do. They did not let us take her for granted. We grew into a lot of new chores that summer. I love how my dad looked after my mom. (And vice versa.)\n\nWhen I had my own kids and my spouse didn\u2019t step up, I definitely noticed. When he took for granted that I would still be getting up and cooking a contribution for the weekly family potluck, I noticed. Especially since he was off work, perfectly well, and *right there.* And now he\u2019s an ex.\n\nSeriously. Time for the kids to learn a bit of empathy for mom, and spouse needs to both model and enforce that.", "Wow who said anything about sex, nobody said anything about sex", "Me too. I wound up making 3x the work for myself because there were so many dishes that I just couldn't.  \nI put it off for days because it was so overwhelming until we ran out of clean dishes. It sucked so bad"]}
