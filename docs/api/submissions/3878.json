Hubby and I switch off on cooking. Even though I had surgery, no matter what, I always make a big homemade breakfast for our family on Saturday morning. My family knows this. Generally we get the kitchen cleaned before bed time on Friday so when I wake up (before everyone) on Saturday I can start making biscuits and cooking bacon, ect. Last night it was forgotten. I had asked my kids (13f and 9m) to simply load the dishwasher after supper. That didn't happen. \n\nThis brings me to I may be the AH. I woke up the kids to help clean the kitchen so I could start cooking. Hubby was up with our toddler so I just wanted her out of the kitchen. I cleaned an area to start breakfast and started doing my thing. Kids fight and nit pick at eachother about cleaning and I just wasn't having it today. I snapped. I told them I just wanted the dang (didn't say dang) dishwasher loaded with out all the yelling and rudeness and I haven't even have my mf coffee and JUST GET TF ALONG! The house goes quiet. I don't normally yell so this came as a shock to everyone.

I went to step outside to smoke a cigarette and my husband runs after like a raging bull (in a hilarious way) and goes to pinch my boobs. I'm still heated (was thinking about the bills again to torture myself i guess) and I say don't and cover myself. He looks hurt and says why. I say I'm pissed that the kitchen was dirty and the kids can't do something without arguing, my suturs hurt from cooking without my belly binder on (my fault), I'm just calming down but feel over stimulated and I simply do not want to be touched atm. Now, apparently, I'm a witch with a B.\n\nI felt bad but at the same time, I just want to sit and relax for a few and not be touched or poked or tickled or have mommy shouted at me for 5 mins, hence, going outside.

My advice is next time hubby is frustrated or upset, pinch his dick. Maybe he is bright enough to catch on. Maybe not, it is worth a try and I think you might just have a giggle. With the kids, I had 4 boys, have one at a time do cleanup, it's just so much easier. Best of luck. Big Grandma Hugs also.", "NTA. Recovery from surgery is personal.", "NTA you are allowed to not want to be touched regardless of anything else.  You are also allowed to reach your limit.  It may have been your hubby trying to lighten the mood, but clearly you weren't ready for it.  \n\nMight be time for a sit down with thr family to discuss what is expected of everyone.  Yeah things get forgotten sometimes but it may be fair to explain what got you upset and how it spiraled until you felt like snapping.  Ask them for help and support.

You have the right to deny being touched whenever the fk you want. You were kinder than I would have been - I probably would have just smacked his hands away. \n\nThat said - sounds like stress levels are high and I've found some grace is generally warranted in these types of situations (was in a serious accident back in July and am still not fully recovered - shit is hard man). \n\nOnce you're both calm - talk it out.

My husband\u2019s love language is definitely more physical, while mine is more verbal.

He also likes to do silly things like it sounds like your husband does as well, but he knows if I tell him to stop it just means I am not in the mood right now. Body autonomy has to be respected in a relationship without hurt feelings.
