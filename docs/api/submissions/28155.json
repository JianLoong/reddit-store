We give the meanings to the names we give our children. Your husband has given the name a deep meaning that lies outside the context of religion. You are the one ascribing the religious context to the name and that seems to be the only reason you dislike this name. \n\nMy husband and I are both non religious, me aggressively so (insofar as keeping it out of my house). That being said, we learned that one of our kids names has a Very religious meaning. Do I hate his name now? Not at all. It only became something we learned about when his school assignment was to research his name.\n\nAs for why I say ESH, there should be compromise from both sides. Either the name should be taken completely out of consideration, or moving it to a middle name/second name to be considered. \n\nBut I will warn you, finding a name not given any religious meaning (in any religion) may prove difficult. All three of my children have at least one name given meaning in a religion. One of them has a roman name of a roman god, another has a name of God, the last has a name that is given much meaning within the Christin bible.

My parents were both atheists, I\u2019m an atheist, and my name is Hebrew for \u201cgrace of God\u201d. I cannot imagine a situation in which a kid would feel pressured to conform to a religion because of their name meaning. Most western names have some religious basis or origin\n\nI\u2019d say NTA, bordering on E S H, because your husband should know that it\u2019s not just his kid and he doesn\u2019t get sole naming rights.
